ADMISSION OF MALE VETERANS: At a special meeting of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia on August 31, 1946, a resolution was adopted admitting male veterans to Mary Washington College for session 1946-47. As a result, there are fifty odd male veterans now attending the college. Thus far this policy of admitting men on a temporary basis seems to have worked out satisfactorily and to the mutual advantage of the veterans and the college. The critical situation with which the nation is confronted in an effort to take care of the veterans and the normal college population does not seem to have improved within the last year. It is, therefore, recommended that the following action be taken: RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that non-boarding male veterans be admitted to Mary Washington College for session 1947-48 be and the same is hereby approved. There was presented to the Board a form of proposed contract between Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia and Veterans Administration, dated May 27, 1947, by which the College agrees to accept for instruction during the period from June 16, 1947, to May 31, 1948, inclusive, Veterans who are approved by the Veterans Administration as entitled to Vocational Rehabilitation Training under Public Law 16 Seventy-eighth Congress, and to furnish books, tools, equipment, etc., necessary for the satisfactory pursuit of the courses being given; the terms under which said Veterans are to be accepted by the College being fully set out in said contract. After consideration of said contract the following resolution was offered and adopted: RESOLVED: That said contract is hereby approved and adopted as a contract of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia and M. L. Combs, President of Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia, is hereby authorized and directed to execute said contract for Vocational Rehabilitation Training of May 27, 1947, in the name and on behalf of said College of the University of Virginia.
