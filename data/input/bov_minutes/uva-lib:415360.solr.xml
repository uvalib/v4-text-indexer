REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE IN RE: INVESTMENTS, ETC. The Rector stated to the Board that, acting in his capacity as Chairman of the Finance Committee, he had conferred with Mr. Buford Scott, of the firm of Scott &amp; Stringfellow, of Richmond, Va., with a view to compiling a list of securities to be purchased for the endowment funds of the University to take up the uninvested cash now in the several depositories, to be presented to this meeting of the Board for its consideration. The conference, however, developed the fact that the question was more than making up a mere list of suggested securities; that there was the further question of giving study to the present investments and the continuing study of the securities under the control of the Rector and Visitors. He further stated that he had discussed with Mr. Scott the possibility of having his firm act in the capacity of investment counsel for the University as to such funds as as may be under the control of the Board, and had suggested that he attend this meeting and give his views of the matter. Mr. Scott was then invited to appear, whereupon a general discussion of the matter was had. He stated that it would be agreeable for his firm to have one of their employees devote a part of his time to the University's account; to advise upon the sale and purchase of its securities; that the compensation for this service would be $100,00 per month, as had been mentioned by the Rector. The matter was disposed of in the following motion, adopted: WHEREAS, Scott and Stringfellow, Investment Bankers, of Richmond, Virginia, have investigated and advised The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, and/or its Finance Committee, in the purchase and sale of many securities, without receiving compensation therefor, other than the customary commission on sales; and WHEREAS, it is deemed proper and fair that a small monthly sum be paid to Scott and Stringfellow as a contribution toward the clerical expense involved in advising upon the purchase and sale of securities owned by the University of Virginia. BE IT RESOLVED: That the sum of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per month be paid to Scott and Stringfellow, for a period of one (1) year from the 1st day of April, 1943, unless either party to this agreement should give to the other, in writing, at least thirty (30) days' notice of a desire to cancel this agreement. The question of investing the present cash in the endowment funds was disposed of in the following motion, adopted: RESOLVED, That the cash held in the several depositories of the University, awaiting investing, be invested by the Chairman of the Finance Committee in such securities as may meet the requirements of the University's former action as to legal investments, including Governments, as he may determine. RESOLVED, FURTHER, that he be authorized to sell, in his discretion, the 870 shares of Commercial Investment Trust common stock now held in the Consolidated Investments. DEPOSITORIES OF THE UNIVERSITY'S ENDOWMENT INVESTMENTS - FIDELITY BONDS THEREFOR: The question of whether or not the several depositories holding the investments of the University's endowment funds should be required to provide fidelity bonds covering the values of their respective holdings, was referred to the Rector to investigate. NAVAL FLIGHT PREPARATORY SCHOOL—CHARACTER OF TEACHING The character of the teaching to be done in the Naval Flight Preparatory School was discussed by the Board, and the President stated that he had recently seen a restricted communication of the Navy giving the rating of the twenty schools engaged in this Pre-Flight Training as regards the results of a mathematics examination prepared in Washington and graded in Washington, and given to all students in the twenty schools. The University of Virginia stood fifth from the top. In four of these schools the students showed higher grades than did ours, and in fifteen of the twenty the grades were lower. "THE SENTINELS OF THE REPUBLIC"-PROPOSED GIFT—DECLINED: The Board discussed the offer made by "The Sentinels of the Republic" to establish here an essay award to carry the name of their organization. After thorough discussion of the subject it was regretfully decided to decline the gift, and the Rector was directed to write a letter to Mr. Cadwallader. On motion the meeting then adjourned: R. Gray Williams RECTOR. E. I. Carruthersa SECRETARY.</field>
