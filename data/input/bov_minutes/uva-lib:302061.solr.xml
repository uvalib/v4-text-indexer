      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia. January 5th, 1914. At a meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia on above date, in the office of the President, East Lawn. Present: Rector Gordon, Visitors Flood, Michie, White, Norton, Craddock, Drewry, Oliver and Stearnes; also Dr. Page and Dr. Whitehead. Mr, Irvine arrived about four o'clock. The Board was called to order at 12:00 M. by the Rector, who presented to the Board a letter from Dr. S. C. Mitchell, President of the Medical College of Virginia, and also one from Mr. Eppa Hunton, Jr., Chairman of the Executive Committee of said Medical College, both of which were read and ordered copied into the minutes. Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia, Dec. 18, 1913. Hon. Armistead C. Gordon, Rector University of Virginia, Staunton, Virginia. My dear Mr. Gordon:- I beg to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 13th inst., with the two inclosures from the Secretary of your Board of Visitors. May I inquire if your Board designated certain ones to act with others from our Board as a Steering Committee to secure the passage of the Enabling Act by the Legislature. I take for granted that Mr. L. Z. Morris, Mr. Eppa Hunton, Jr., Dr. George Ben Johnston and Mr. John W. Williams will act in this capacity for the Medical College. May I inquire also if the Enabling Act is in course of preparation. It seems vitally important that we should present a united front to the Legislature, and you will no doubt agree that it will be helpful to all interests to secure the passage of Enabling Act at the earliest possible moment. Our Board stands ready, as I understand it, to go right forward with the proposed merger. Very sincerely yours, (signed) S. C. Mitchell. Richmond, Va., December 30th, 1913. Hon. Armistead C. Gordon, Rector of University of Virginia, Staunton, Va. Dear Sir:- Your letter of the 13th inst., addressed to Dr. S. C. Mitchell, President Medical College of Virginia, was submitted to the Executive Committee of the Medical College of Virginia at its meeting on yesterday. I think I am correct in saying that during all of the negotiations looking to the merger of the Medical College of Virginia into the Medical Department of the University of Virginia, there is not a single suggestion which has been made by the Medical College of Virginia, or any one connected with it, which has received favorable consideration by your Board, although a number of these suggestions were endorsed and approved by the Committee of your Board at its conference with the Committee of the Board of the Medical College of Virginia. These suggestions all grew out of our familiarity with the conditions in Richmond, with which your Board could not be familiar, and which if adopted we believed would contribute very considerably to the successful administration of your Medical Department here. We now understand very clearly that we must agree to whatever your Board may wish, in order to reach an agreement with it. We have been greatly disappointed at the spirit in which we have been met in these negotiations, and feel it very keenly— We are, however, not willing to permit our personal feelings to interfere with a great enterprise from which we believe great results will come. The Executive Committee of the Medical College of Virginia, although it believes that its suggestions were wise, and would have been most helpful, do not believe that they are essentials, and therefore, has unanimously instructed me to advise you that it will accept and agree to the terms and conditions of merger adopted by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia at its meeting on the 11th day of November, 1913, and reaffirmed at its meeting on December 10th, 1913. I am, Yours very truly, (signed) Eppa Hunton, Jr. The merger of the two medical schools was then taken up and discussed very fully by the members of the Board and also by Dr. Whitehead, and the matter was disposed of in the following resolution, offered by Mr. White as a substitute to one offered by Mr. Gordon, and adopted by the following vote; Ayes, Messrs. Flood, White, Norton, Craddock, Drewry, Stearnes. Noes, Messrs. Gordon, Michie and Oliver. (Mr. Irvine had not then arrived.) Resolved: That the Rector be and is hereby authorized to prepare, or cause to be prepared, an Act to enable this Board to carry into effect the agreement reached for the transfer of the Medical Department at Richmond, and that when so prepared, he, together with Dr. Alderman, Dr. Whitehead, and with the other members of the Committee provided for November 11, 1913, to act in conjunction with a similar committee on behalf of the Medical College of Virginia, to confer with the gentlemen from whom it is hoped the contribution contemplated by said agreement, will be made; and if said persons give said committee satisfactory assurances as to amount and terms of such contribution, then and in that event, the said Rector and his associated shall report their action to the Board. The Rector appointed a committee consisting of Messrs. White, Norton and Flood to prepare the Enabling Act as provided for in the foregoing resolution. The foregoing resolution was a substitute for the following offered by Mr. Gordon:- Resolved: That the agreement between the University of Virginia and the Medical College of Virginia for the absorption of the Medical College of Virginia by the University of Virginia, as a part of its Medical Department to be located at Richmond, having been concluded, this agreement be submitted to the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the General Education Board, from whom a proper endowment is expected, in order that the assurances of such endowment be given by said corporations in accordance with the provisions of the sixth and last clause of said articles of agreement, to the end that application may be made to the General Assembly for an Enabling Act. The question of the establishment of a woman's college co-ordinate with the University and to be located in proximity thereto, which was under consideration at the December 11th meeting and carried over to this day for final action, was taken up. Several members offered motions, among which was a proposed enabling act presented by Judge Norton, to be substituted for that of the advocates of the woman's college. A very thorough discussion of the whole matter was had by the body, and the question was disposed of in the following manner. The chair ruled, that of the several motions, that presented by Mr. Michie was the original, and the others would be taken up and passed upon as presented, resulting as follows; Mr. White presented the following substitute for the original which was defeated by a vote of seven to three, viz:- Ayes,—Messrs. Flood, Irvine and White. Noes,—Messrs. Gordon, Craddock, Drewry, Michie, Norton, Oliver and Stearnes. A petition having been presented to this Board asking its approval of a measure looking to the establishment of a female school on or near the grounds of this institution, to be under the government of the Rector and Visitors as a department of the University; and a full hearing having been accorded those who support the movement, and the subject having been maturely considered, it is the sense of the Rector and Visitors that the establishment of such a feature in the life of the University would not promote its usefulness; and therefore its approval must be withheld. Judge Norton then placed before the body the first two sections of his paper as a substitute for the original which was defeated by a tie vote of five to five, viz:— Ayes,—Messrs. Gordon, Craddock, Norton, Oliver, and Stearnes. Noes,—Messrs. Drewry, Flood, Irvine, Michie, and White. That it would be unwise for the State to attempt to provide for higher education of men and women in totally disconnected institutions, located distantly from each other, with a varying or different standard of degrees. Rival claims upon the Legislature for adequate support would be serious, if not disastrous to both institutions. There would be a strong tendency to divide men and women of the State. There would be danger of real calamity. With co-ordination, and students of both institutions receiving degrees with the imprimature of the University, rivalry would be, at least, modified; for women would be interested in strengthening the University upon which they would be dependent for high degrees; and the men's pride would badly bear a neglected Woman's Co-ordinate College. Self interest and self respect would demand co-operation. Higher education by the State for men and women should be directed and controlled from one center. This is the logic of the situation, and a necessity to prevent divided allegiance of our people, and to turn the minds and hearts of all to one great University. We must recognize the trend of the times and the change in conditions. In almost every walk of life woman's sphere of activity has wonderfully advanced. The question demands answer. Shall our University close, absolutely, forever, the door of hope for women, so far as it is concerned; or shall it march abreast of the times, and extend to them such aid and encouragement as it can? That the Woman's College, if established by the State, should be co-ordinate with the University of Virginia, and under its guidance and complete control. Its location should be on separate grounds of its own, at least one half mile from the Rotunda of the University. The degrees conferred should have the same requirements, as the like degrees in the University, and should bear the imprimatur of the University by proper certificate thereon, thus guaranteeing that the holder thereof was of equal learning and attainments with the University graduate. Mr. Stearnes then presented the following substitute to the original (by Mr. Michie) which was defeated by the vote of eight to two, viz.—Ayes,—Messrs. Oliver and Stearnes; Noes,—Messrs. Gordon, Craddock, Drewry, Flood, Irvine, Michie, Norton and White. Whereas, the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia believe that Virginia should make such provision for the education of the young women of the State as may be consistent with a just consideration of the other necessary calls upon the public revenues, and Whereas, we believe that one practical and efficient mode of meeting this need, would be found in the creation of a woman's college co-ordinate with the University. Resolved, first, that it is the sense of the Rector and Visitors that if the General Assembly in its wisdom sees fit now or in the future to found a co-ordinate college for women near the University, such college should be located on or beyond the eastern limits of the City of Charlottesville, thereby minimizing the dangers of actual or virtual co-education. Resolved, second, that if the estimates made for the needs of the woman's college should fall within the limits of the amount of revenue that the Legislature deems available for such an enterprise, then the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia recommend that a proper enabling act be granted in accordance with the provisions of a paper herewith submitted. All substitutes being disposed of, the original by Mr. Michie was placed upon its passage, and adopted by a vote of six to four, viz:- Ayes,—Gordon, Drewry, Flood, Irvine, Michie, and White. Noes,—Messrs. Craddock, Norton, Oliver and Stearnes. Whereas, the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia believe that Virginia should make such provision for the education of the young women of the State as may be consistent with a just consideration of the other necessary calls upon the public revenues; and Whereas, the Rector and Visitors further believe that one practical and efficient mode of meeting this need would be found in the creation of a woman's college co-ordinate with the University; therefore be it Resolved, That it is the sense of the Rector and Visitors that the first step should be the appointment by the General Assembly of Virginia of a competent commission to make a thorough and searching investigation, and a careful and detailed examination into the costs of founding and maintaining such college. Resolved, That it is the sense of the Rector and Visitors that if the General Assembly in its wisdom sees fit now or in the future to found a co-ordinate college for women near the University, such female department should as a condition precedent to its establishment, be located on a site beyond the eastern limits of the city of Charlottesville. Dean Page called the attention of the Board to the fact that Professor Charles Hancock, on account of ill-health had been compelled to relinquish his work for the present. The matter was thoroughly discussed, and disposed of in the following resolutions,— Resolved, That Professor Charles Hancock, on account of the weak state of his health, be and is hereby granted leave of absence, on full pay, from the University until September 10, 1914. Resolved, That the sum of $600., or as much thereof as may be necessary, be and is hereby appropriated, to be used by the Dean of the Department of Engineering, in providing means for carrying on Professor Charles Hancock's work for the rest of this session. On motion, the Board then adjourned. E. I. Carruthers, Secretary. Armistead C. Gordon, Rector.</field>
