Present the same members as on yesterday. Resolved that the salary of the Chairman of the Faculty be fixed at five hundred dollars per annum. Dr. Woods submitted the following report from the Committee on Finance. The Committee on Finance ask leave to make the following report: that while they have not had time to examine very minutely the books or accounts of the University as kept by the Chairman of the Faculty acting as Proctor, still they are satisfied of their entire accuracy and what is most gratifying after paying the current charges we find a small balance in the treasury. The expenditures have been eminently judicious, and we take peculiar pleasure in testifying to the admirable manner in which the Chairman of the Faculty has performed the very arduous duties which have devolved upon him, reference is made to his report for a full statement of receipts and expenditures. John R. Woods T. J. Pretlow. On motion the report was adopted As a substitute for a report from the Committee on Apparatus Dr. Woods offered the following resolution which was adopted.

Resolved that the Chairman under the sanction of the Executive Committee be instructed to rent the rooms on Carr's Hill if the probable increase of students shall require it. Professor S. Maupin was unanimously reelected Chairman of the Faculty for the ensuing year. The subject of compensation to Dr. Maupin for use of his wagon and horses was considered, but for want of time was postponed till the meeting of the Board in August. Mr. Johnson from the Committee on Grounds &amp; Buildings submitted the following report. Report of Committee on Buildings, Grounds &amp;c. The undersigned appointed Committee as aforesaid beg leave respectfully to report that they have given to the subject of consideration such attention as they deem necessary. In as much as the Board has already taken action on several matters, the Committee think it proper only to report That the opening of an additional hotel renders it necessary that, that building be put in repair for use as early as practicable - they have not been able however to procure any estimate of the cost of the improvements or repairs, nor do they deem it essential and respectfully recommend that the Chairman of the Faculty, under the direction of the Executive Committee proceed as early as practicable to have the hotel put in proper serviceable condition. Two of the Dawson buildings specially require roofing and the Committee recommend that the Chairman receive the same instructions in regard to them, subject however to the like control. The Privies in and about the University particularly demand prompt attention. The drainage connected with them is very imperfect and the Committee see no means by which an adequate corrective can be made except by causing water to be conducted to them. They are now in a very obnoxious condition and but for the very abundant use of lime would be absolutely insufferable. An Epidemic may at any time arise from them and the Committee therefore recommend that a resolution be passed referring the subject to the Chairman of the Faculty with directions to repair and improve as soon as practicable. The Board having referred the subject of Water, it is unnecessary to make further mention of it. For the accommodation of Professors &amp; students very many improvements &amp; additions are desirable and would be noticed further but for the exhausted state of the finances of the University. Specific action having been taken on other important matters, the Committee do not deem it necessary to say more than that they think the repairs may generally be done by the Chairman under such instruction as the Executive Committee may from time to time think proper to give. In regard to the enlargement of accommodations for the Washington Society, the Committee that they would be pleased to favour the application, but that at present it cannot be done. Respectfully submitted &amp;c. Marmaduke Johnson R. W. Hughes. On motion the report was adopted. On motion the Board adjourned till Wednesday August 15th at 5 oclock P.M. Wm. Wertenbaker Secretary B. J. Barbour Rector of U. of Va.</field>
