      <field name="fulltext">ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFFICE OF UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR Over the past several years the Board of Visitors has noted a steady increase in the duties and responsibilities of the President of the University. Relations with the Federal and State governments have become much more demanding of time and effort; the internal management of the University has become more complex; and the need to gain increased support from alumni, friends, and foundations has become more pressing. In fact, the unique character of the University of Virginia demands constant attention to the development of private support commensurate with that at major private institutions, as well as continuing attention to University-State government relations. Believing that increased private support is vital to the continuing advancement of the University, the Board of Visitors is conducting a study of the feasibility of a substantial enhancement of University development efforts designed to increase the endowment and gain private support for programs and projects which the State cannot reasonably be expected to support. The Code of Virginia states that "it is the public policy of the State to encourage the state-supported institutions of Higher Education in Virginia in their attempts to increase their endowment funds." The Board has requested the President to devote significantly greater attention to the University's efforts in that regard. In the light of these considerations, the Board has concluded that it is in the best interests of the University to establish a new executive office under the President to which substantial responsibility can be delegated for the internal affairs of the institution. Accordingly, the Board has authorized the establishment of the Office of Chancellor of the University. The Vice-Presidents will continue to have access directly to the President. However, in the course of their day-to-day execution of the executive duties delegated to them, which will remain unchanged, they will confer with the Chancellor, gaining such direction as circumstances may warrant. The President will continue to be the Chief Executive Officer responsible to the Board of Visitors with the powers and duties set forth in the Manual of the Board of Visitors. However, he will hold authority to delegate to the Chancellor responsibility for the regular execution of certain of these duties. It will continue to be the responsibility of the President to act as adviser to the Board and to recommend to it those policies and programs which in his opinion will best promote the interests of the University. In order that the President can immediately focus a greater portion of his time and effort on the enhancement of the University's private resources, he is authorized to assign to the Vice-Presidents such additional duties as he deems necessary on an interim basis. The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Office of University Chancellor under the President of the University be and it is hereby established; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Rector shall appoint a special committee for the nomination of a University Chancellor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPROVAL OF PROCEDURE FOR ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION OF REAL ESTATE The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the procedures for Acquisition and Disposition of Real Estate as Endowment Assets which were discussed in Executive Session of the Finance Committee be and they are hereby adopted.

      <field name="fulltext">AUTHORIZATION TO CONVEY PROPERTY FROM THE REBA L. OSBORNE BEQUEST In her Will, Reba L.
