      <field name="fulltext">November 10, 1945 A special meeting of the Board of Visitors was held on this date in the President's Office at 11 o'clock, with the following present: The Rector, R. Gray Williams, Visitors C. B. Garnett, E. C. Anderson, D. S. Lancaster, M. H. Bustard, Mrs. O. A. Calcott, Mrs. Phoebe E. Willis, Mrs. Bertha P. Wailes, President Newcomb and President Combs. Minutes of the meeting of September 12, 1945, copied and mailed to the members were approved. The President made the following announcements: ENROLLMENT AS OF THIS DATE: 1863 GIFTS: From Mr. Jesse H. Jones $300,000.00 payable $20,000.00 a year, over a period of fifteen years, for the support of the Woodrow Wilson School of International Affairs. From Mr. and Mrs. C. B. Baker 5,000.00 to pay the cost of air conditioning the Children's Ward at the University Hospital. The Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia has, by proper resolution, given to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia the lot at the south west corner of Route 29 and Route 250 as a site for its Student Activities Building. From The Alumni Board of Trustees $32,000.00 in part payment of the purchase price of the Massie property, known as Copeley, containing 120 acres. RESIGNATION: The resignation of Dr. Lester Cappon, Associate Professor of History, was presented and accepted with regret. We wish for Dr. Cappon the highest success in his new undertaking. PROMOTIONS: Dr. Dirk Reuyl, Assistant Professor of Astronomy, to Associate Professor of Astronomy, with a salary of $3,750. ELECTIONS: Dr. Chalmers Laughlin Gemmill, Professor of Pharmacology, encumbency to begin October 1, 1945, at a salary of $6,000 per session. Mr. James H. Newman, Dean of Students, incumbency to begin February 25, 1946, at a salary of $6,000 per calendar year. APPOINTMENTS: Lt. Commander Willard Eugene Neve, Associate Professor of Naval Science and Tactics, effective October 18, 1945, without salary from the University. LT. DONALD L. SCHREINER, Assistant Professor of Naval Science and tactics effective October 10, 1945, without salary from the University. A request was made by Dr. Vincent W. Archer for permission to set aside $6,000 of his departmental earnings to be used as a loan fund to medical graduates who desire training in roentgenology. It was duly presented and passed. A request from the Virginia Wooglin Company for a reduction in the interest rate on their indebtedness to the University of Virginia from 5% to 3Â½% was referred to the Finance Committee with power to act. Mrs. Randall-MacIver presented a request that the income on the trust fund bequeathed to the University by her husband, which fund is still in the hands of the trustees, be paid to her during her lifetime, due to her dire necessity for funds on which to live. The request was considered, but as it is beyond the power of the University to make contributions from such funds outside of the purposes for which they were designated, the request was regretfully declined. REPORT OF MR. PERKINS ON THE CLAIM OF SELL SHIFLETT: In April, last, suit was instituted in the Circuit Court of Albemarle County by one Sell Shiflett of Greene County, Virginia, against Dr. C. S. Lentz, Administrator of University Hospital, Dr. James R. Cash, head of the Department of Pathology of said Hospital, and Dr. Glenn Hendrickson, Dr. Robert Boyd, and Dr. R. E. Balsley, in which the plaintiff claims damages in the sum of $5,000.00 alleging that on the 27th of January, 1945, in the University Hospital, an autopsy was performed upon the dead body of Addie Shiflett, deceased wife of said Sell Shiflett, without the consent of said Sell Shiflett and without obtaining proper authority from the Commonwealth's Attorney or Judge of the Circuit Court of Greene County, and that furthermore certain vital organs were removed from said body without the consent of said plaintiff. This suit was brought on behalf of said Sell Shiflett by John J. Morris, Attorney-at-Law of Stanardsville. The case was a dangerous one from the standpoint of the University, and with the approval of the Rector, the President, and several members of this Board, we have made every effort to settle the matter out of Court. We had several conferences with Mr. Morris and finally succeeded in obtaining an offer on behalf of his client to settle the claim in full by payment of $765.00. I strongly recommend this settlement and although it will be noted that this suit is against individual employees of the University, it is my opinions that this settlement is within the power of this Board. Respectfully submitted, W. Allan Perkins Attorney for the Board. The foregoing report was disposed of and the following resolution adopted: RESOLVED, that Mr. Perkins, as Attorney for this Board, be and is hereby authorized to accept the offer of John J. Morris, Attorney for Sell Shiflett, to settle the claim of the latter against Drs. Lentz, Cash, Hendrickson, Boyd, and Balsley, for the sum of $765.00 cash. IN RE: EMPLOYMENT OF INVESTMENT COUNSELLOR: In the matter of Mr. Channing W. Daniel's application for the position of Investment Counsellor for the University of Virginia, after a full discussion of the matter, the Rector was authorized to advise Mr. Daniel that the matter was considered and that the Board voted unanimously against the employment of a resident Investment Counsellor at this time. The question of providing housing for married veterans was considered, and the President was authorized to enter into necessary contracts for the purchase and erection of housing for married veterans to be erected on University property at a cost not to exceed $150,000 to be aid from University funds with the understanding that the Governor will ask the Legislature to appropriate the necessary amount to reimburse the University. PURCHASE OF THE "COPELEY" PROPERTY: (Massie Property) The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED, that the President be and he is hereby authorized and directed to purchase for the sum of $65,000.00, the property known as "Copeley" located just across route 20 from land now owned by the University of Virginia, containing 120 acres, more or less, to be paid for by deficit appropriation authorized by the Governor in the sum of $32,500.00 and an appropriation from the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund in the sum of $32,500.00 MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE MATTERS: ELECTIONS: EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 17, 1945: Miss Margery Eleanor Arnold elected Instructor in Health and Physical Education at a salary of $2,150 per nine months' session. Dr. Beverly T. Moss elected Assistant Professor of Latin, tenure of one year, at a salary of $2,400.00 per nine months' session. Mrs. Mattie Lou Sholes elected Instructor in Home Economics at a salary of $2,000 per nine months' session. RESIGNATION: Lyle S. Hiatt, Associate Professor of Commerce, effective December 31, 1945. PURCHASE OF THE BROMPTON PROPERTY: At the last meeting on September 12, 1945, the Board of Visitors authorized Mary Washington College to purchase the historic Brompton estate of 174 acres and to pay a sum not to exceed $65,000.00 which seemed to be sufficient at that time. Before the transaction could be completed, however, the owners received an offer at $73,000.00 from another source. In order to secure the property, therefore, it was necessary for the college to make another offer in the amount of $71,000.00 which was approved by the Governor. In spite of the fact that the offer of $73,000.00 was subsequently raised to $75,000.00, the heirs and the commissioners agreed to sell the property to the college for $71,000.00. It is, therefore, recommended that the following action be taken. RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that the President of Mary Washington College be, and he is hereby authorized and directed to purchase for the sum of seventy-one thousand dollars ($71,000) the property known as "Brompton", located near the present campus, containing one hundred seventy-four (174) acres, more or less, to be paid for out of the money accummulated in the College's maintenance fund through operating economies and revenues collected in excess of budget estimates. The meeting then adjourned. R. Gray Williams Rector E. I. Carruthersa Secretary</field>
