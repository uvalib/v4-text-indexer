He reported that the investments of the estate were to be handled by the Trust Committee of the Whitney National Bank of New Orleans. The President stated that he had a letter from Mr. Perkins concerning representation of the University in New Orleans by counsel. He was requested to confer with Mr. Perkins concerning the selection of counsel. CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE The President reported that the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace had scheduled a conference at the University, November 18-20, of representatives of the leading colleges in Virginia and adjoining states and asked that a delegate from the Board be appointed The Rector was asked to appoint a delegate. STRINGFELLOW BARR The Rector reported that he had written Mr. Wright concerning Mr. Barr, in accordance with the instructions of the Board. Professor Wright replied that he did not wish to make any charges against Professor Barr at this time.

The President was asked to secure for the Board an outline of the courses taught by Professor Barr STORM SEWER AT SITE OF REFLECTION POOL The President asked permission of the Board to install a storm sewer where the Reflection Pool is now located adjacent to the Gymnasium.

President Chandler stated that William and Mary desired to continue the operation of R.P.I. and would attempt to improve the academic standing. MCINTIRE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION The President pointed out that the McIntire School of Business Administration was under the same chairmanship as the James Wilson School of Economics, and stated that there was considerable friction between the faculties of the two schools as to the type of training that should be offered. The President stated that he believed two steps were necessary to correct the difficulties: (1) to separate the schools and appoint a chairman of the McIntire School of Business Administration; and (2) at a later date, if funds were secured for a graduate school of business administration, then to establish a separate professional department in the University to offer training at both the graduate and undergraduate level in business administration. INSTRUCTION IN THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES The President reported that the Lower Division Committee was doing a superb job in reshaping the quality of the teaching in the College. ATHLETICS The President read a letter from Mr. Joe Noertker, a basketball star who graduated in 1950, concerning the athletic situation at the University. The Rector then read a letter from Mr. James G. McManaway, President of the Washington, D. C. chapter of Virginia alumni, endorsing the present athletic policy of the University and repudiating the Gooch report. Mr. Black proposed that he answer the letter in a sympathetic manner, enclosing a copy of the statement the President had made concerning this issue and pointing out that the Board does not wish to make any further statement at this time until the matter is acted upon by the University Senate and submitted to the Board for action Mr. Talbott expressed concern over the resolution of the faculty adopting the report of the Gooch Committee, which implies that faculty authority is paramount in this matter without any voice by the Board. Mr. Black said that he did not believe this to be the intent of the resolution The President stated that he believed the faculty felt they were the proper body to exercise control over athletics and did not question the ultimate authority of the Board of Visitors in this matter. The President asked authority of the Board to suggest to the University Senate that a committee of the Board had been studying this matter for a year and a half and that the Senate work with this Committee of the Board in a solution to the athletic problem RICHEY REPORT Mr. Black presented the revised report of the Committee to record the Board's reasons for action taken with respect to the petition of Professor Homer Richey. It was the sense of the Board that the report should be mimeographed and distributed to the members prior to the December meeting. USE OF RUCKER FUNDS FOR PSYCHIATRY CLINIC The Board authorized the use of money, as necessary, from the Rucker Fund for remodeling the former quarters of the University Press for a psychiatry clinic. The President stated that the expenditure would be kept to a minimum. MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE MATTERS Dr. Combs, Dean Alvey and Mr. Edgar E. Woodward, Bursar of Mary Washington, were present for discussion of these matters. MUSIC SUMMER SCHOOL President Combs presented a proposal for the institution of a special school of music during the summer session of 1952. It was estimated that the cost of this program would be approximately $10,000, the major portion of which would be paid in to the college in the form of fees and other charges. President Combs stated that the matter had been carefully studied and it was believed that in two or three years such a project could become self-supporting. The Mary Washington Committee recommended to the Board that Mary Washington College be authorized to conduct a music summer school on an experimental basis during the summer of 1952. This recommendation was approved by the Board. LIBRARY REPORT President Combs presented to the Board copies of the report which Mr. Quenzel had submitted on the operation of the E. Lee Trinkle Library for the year 1950-51.
