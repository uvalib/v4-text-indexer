Political activities are, in general, those normally engaged in by political parties or special interest groups, such as electioneering or lobbying. Electioneering shall include the broad range of those activities incidental to the promotion of partisan political ideas or programs and their representatives. Lobbying shall include any activity whose purpose is to procure or prevent, the acceptance of any social, economic or political theory as an operating principle or policy. This shall not include engaging in non-partisan analyses, study, or research or making those results available to the public.

Lobbying includes any activity the principal purpose of which is to influence the passage or defeat of specific legislation. Electioneering encompasses participating or intervening in any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office.

If a governmental inquiry or audit is initiated as a result of an activity of a particular organization that may lead to the imposition of excise taxes or otherwise impair the University's tax-exempt status, the University may suspend, withdraw or discontinue funding to that organization after notice and an opportunity to be heard." BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED that the foregoing amendments to the Guidelines for Student Activities Current Fund Allocation shall apply to all student organization funding requests that are pending on, or are made after, July 1, 1989.</field>
