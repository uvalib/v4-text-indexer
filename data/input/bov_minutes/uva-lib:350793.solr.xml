      <field name="fulltext">28 February 1959 A called meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia was held on this date at 10:00 A. M. in the Office of the President of the University, at Charlottesville, with the following present: The Rector, Frank Talbott, Jr.; President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. (Mr. Darden was delayed by transportation difficulties in returning to Charlottesville from a trip and did not enter the meeting until approximately 11:30 A. M.); and Visitors Berkeley, Bryan, Coxe, Fenwick, Greear, Jones, Lantor, McWane, Martin, Montague, Paschall, Pollock, Smith, and Wheeler. Absent: Visitors Blanton and Hartfield. The Rector noted that Visitors Blanton and Hartfield were unavoidably absent. The minutes of the meeting of 14 February 1959, previously distributed, were approved. REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON NOMINATION OF A PRESIDENT On behalf of the Committee on Nomination of a President, the Rector presented the following Report: TO THE BOARD OF VISITORS, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: Your Committee on the Nomination of a President, appointed on 14 June 1958, to find and recommend to the Board a suitable successor to President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., presents herewith a report of its work in performance of the assignment and its recommendation to the Board with respect to the election of President Darden's successor. PRELIMINARY - The Rector and the Executive Committee having been informed of President Darden's intentions prior to formal announcement of his resignation, certain preliminary work was done prior to the appointment of this committee which it is proper to report here. After discussion of the need for increase in the salary of the President, Messrs. Greear and McWane and the Rector called on the Governor in June of 1957 and presented the needs of the University in this regard. As a result of this conference the President's salary was fixed in the succeeding budget at $20,000, which is the same salary paid to the Governor. Furthermore, since that time it has been determined that certain additional perquisites are available, which, in the opinion of the committee, has placed us in a competitive position with respect to compensation of the President. In the fall of 1957 Messrs. Berkeley and Talbott had a profitable interview with Mr. Harold Helm, Chairman of the Princeton University Trustees and Chairman of the Board of Chemical Corn Exchange Bank, New York. Mr. Helm had then recently been chairman of the Princeton Trustees' committee on selection of a new President at that University and gave us some valuable advice on methods and procedures, as well as a list of nominees considered by the Princeton authorities in the later stages of their search for a President. It was agreed that the Faculty of the University should be informed of the President's decision as early as was practical so that prompt steps might be taken to secure the advice and cooperation of the Faculty in connection with the committee's assignment. Accordingly, President Darden informed the University Senate of the decision on 18 March 1958, and on 6 May the University Senate created a special committee of ten, representing the ten schools of the University located in Charlottesville, to advise and cooperate with the Visitors' committee in finding a successor to President Darden. This committee consisted of Dean C. C. Abbott, Graduate School of Business Administration, Professor J. M. Buchanan, School of Commerce, Professor H. C. Dillard, School of Law, Dean T. K. Fitz Patrick, School of Architecture, Professor R. K. Gooch, College of Arts and Sciences, Professor C. Henderson, School of Engineering, Professor B. S. Leavell, School of Medicine, Professor R. A. Meade, School of Education, Dean Margaret Tyson, School of Nursing, and Professor W. S. Weedon (Chairman), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. On 14 June the President's resignation was presented to the Board and on the same date this committee, consisting of Visitors Berkeley, Bryan, McWane, Pollock, Smith, and Talbott, was created. The services of Mr. Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., formerly Secretary to the Board, were sought as Secretary of this committee and, fortunately for us, Mr. Berkeley accepted. Being impressed with the magnitude and overwhelming importance of its assignment, the committee was prepared to proceed at once with its work. FIRST MEETING - At its first meeting, convened on 14 June, your committee joined with the Steering Committee of the Senate Advisory Committee, consisting of Professor William S. Weedon as Chairman and Professors Hardy C. Dillard, Robert K. Gooch, and Charles Henderson. At this time your committee, in agreement with the Steering Committee of the Faculty group, arrived at the unanimous conclusion that certain basic qualifications should be sought in any nominee presented by us to this Board. WE AGREED THAT WE SHOULD LOOK FOR A MAN WHO HAD ATTAINED DISTINCTION AS A SCHOLAR, PREFERABLY IN THE FIELD OF LIBERAL ARTS, AND THE ABILITY TO REPRESENT AND ENGENDER RESPECT FOR THE VALUES OF HIGHER EDUCATION, THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEMS OF VIRGINIA AND THE SOUTH WITH RESPECT TO INTEGRATION, THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ACQUIRE AN INFLUENTIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES OF THE STATE AND TO CREATE A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION IN PUBLIC ADDRESS, THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DELEGATE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY AND TO CREATE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT IN RELATIONS WITH THE STUDENT BODY. WE AGREED AS A MATTER OF PREFERENCE THAT HE SHOULD BE A MARRIED MAN AND THAT THE IDEAL AGE WOULD BE IN THE NEIGHBOR HOOD OF FIFTY, OR YOUNGER THAN THAT IF THE OTHER QUALIFICATIONS WERE FOUND TO EXIST. Subsequently in our screening operations the age qualification was modified by a decision not to consider nominees born prior to 1904, in the absence of unusual circumstances. In determining the age qualification your committee felt that any nominee past the age referred to would not have sufficient time prior to retirement to achieve maximum usefulness. Related to decisions reached at the first meeting is the subject matter of the "Report from the Special Committee of the University Senate", a copy of which has been heretofore given to the members of the Board. This document was impressive in its underlying reasoning and was a valuable reference for basic study of our problem. At this same meeting we also reached an understanding with the Faculty Advisory Committee as to procedures to be followed, which are reflected in the remaining portions of this report. REQUESTS FOR ADVICE AND SUGGESTIONS - On 16 June the Senate Committee addressed a circular letter to all Faculty members, soliciting advice, suggestions, and nominations. On the same date the Rector, as chairman of the committee, addressed a letter to Lawrence Lewis, Jr., President of the Alumni Association of the University, requesting that he circularize all alumni chapters to the same effect, and this was done. Simultaneously the committee received and proceeded to study the files of Mr. T. Benjamin Gay, a former member of this Board, which reflected the activities of the Visitors' committee in its selection of President Darden in 1947, and the files of Mr. McWane showing procedure on selection of the Chancellor of Mary Washington College in 1955. Following a prearranged plan the committee addressed letters to Mr. Arthur S. Adams, President of the American Council on Education, Mr. Henry T. Heald, President of the Ford Foundation, and Mr. Dean Rusk, President of the Rockefeller Foundation, asking their advice on the problem before us. During the months of June, July, August, September, October, and November individual members of the committee or its Secretary had personal interviews for the same purpose with Dean Rusk of the Rockefeller Foundation, James A. Perkins of the Carnegie Foundation, ex-President of Princeton University, Harold W. Dodds, Henry M. Wriston, ex-President of Brown University, President John A. Perkins of the University of Delaware, President Courtney C. Smith of Swarthmore College, and Dr. Robert M. Lester, Director of the Southern Fellowships Fund at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. All of these persons were regarded by us as having intimate acquaintance with the nature of our problem and with prominent figures in educational circles who might be considered eligible to fill the position of President of the University of Virginia. At a special meeting called for the purpose the Raven Society of the University developed a "Report on Qualifications of a University President", which was filed with the committee, received with respect, and studied with interest. The Committee, also on solicitation, received advice from Dr. Pauline G. King, Chairman of the Faculty General Cooperative Committee at Mary Washington College, the Clinch Valley Chapter of the American Association of University Professors, J. N. G. Finley, Director of the Northern Virginia Center, and Dr. Oliver C. Carmichael, the distinguished Southern educator whose advice had also proved useful to the Visitors' Committee of 1947 which nominated Mr. Darden to the Board. THE SELECTIVE PROCESS - As a result of the efforts recited above and the general publicity attendant on the need for choice of a new President, nominations came in from faculty, alumni, friends of the University, and the specially informed sources whose advice we had sought. All these nominations were referred automatically to the Faculty Advisory Committee, which acted as a screening group. All of them were measured against the qualifications previously established and except in a few special instances all of those born prior to 1904 were rejected as ineligible. The Faculty Committee has reported the results of its screening activities periodically to this committee, which has studied and evaluated such reports. The total number of nominations received was 161. Of these more than 60 were rejected because of age requirements and other apparent and compelling reasons. With respect to those remaining, biographical material and other available information with regard to each nominee was assembled and put in written form for study by this committee and by the Faculty Advisory Committee As a result of the above procedure, prolonged discussions at six meetings of this committee, including three joint sessions with the Steering Committee of the Faculty Advisory Committee, organized correspondence between members of this committee, and personal interviews by members of your committee with distinguished educators and others whom we considered to have pertinent information available, the number of potential nominees was reduced by 8 November to eleven. Your committee then began by personal interviews with the group remaining and by the assembly of additional intimate information from available sources to screen this group further. By 17 January your committee had completed its personal discussions with all of them. On Sunday morning, 18 January, we met for a four-hour session devoted to discussion of the names then under consideration. As a result of these deliberations the number of nominees in active consideration was reduced to four On these remaining four nominees your committee and its Secretary have since worked constantly in an effort to gather any facts bearing on their careers which might be pertinent to our decision. The information so assembled has been derived from study of their records, both academic and otherwise, interviews with educators and others familiar with their performance in undergraduate, postgraduate, and subsequent phases of their careers. Detailed examination of military service records has been made where available. The results of our investigations concerning these four nominees have been communicated orally to the Board. REVIEW - It is not possible in this report to review completely the details of the day-to-day work of the Visitors' and Faculty's committees from June 1958 through February 1959. It is pertinent, however, to record that there have been twelve meetings of your full committee since its appointment on 14 June, that members of your committee and its Secretary have had (in addition to formal discussions with nominees at committee meetings) twenty personal interviews with distinguished educators and others concerning problems before the committee and qualifications of the nominees from time to time under consideration, and that we have studied and evaluated six reports on their screening operations submitted by the Faculty Advisory group, representing an outlay of time and thought on their part which must be equal to or greater than that involved in our own deliberations CONCLUSION - Acting now with benefit of the cumulative effect of the work that has been done, the advice received from outside sources, and, most important of all, the advice and consideration of representatives of our own Faculty group, we are prepared to recommend for election as our next President Dr. Edgar Finley Shannon, Jr. We have searched far and have finally come to you with a man from home, who is a native Virginian, for the past three years a member of the faculty of the Department of English at this University. Measuring him by the qualifications first set out as our guide, he has, notwithstanding his relative youth, attained distinction as a scholar, and that in the field of liberal arts, he unquestionably has the ability to represent and engender respect for the values of higher education, with the background of a Virginia breeding and undergraduate education, he has a sympathetic understanding of the problems of Virginia and the South with respect to integration. The record of his military service of five years in the United States Navy, which included combat duty in practically every major action in the Pacific theater, indicates qualities of leadership and the kind of executive ability required of the office of President in dealing with governmental authorities and with internal administration. In our oral presentation we have given you details concerning his undergraduate and postgraduate life, his work as a Rhodes scholar at Merton College, Oxford, in fellowship study at Leeds and London Universities, and as a member of the faculty and tutorial staff at Harvard. His wife, herself a Southerner, a holder of the B.A. and M.A. degrees, a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and formerly Dean of Women at Southwestern College, Memphis, is equipped to give invaluable aid to him if he is chosen as our President We believe that we are fortunate to find among our own a young man whose past performance indicates so clearly the qualities which we have sought. We believe that Dr. Shannon in the position of President will deserve and receive the strong and enthusiastic support of our faculty and we unanimously recommend his election Dated 28 February 1959. /s/ Norborne Berkeley Norborne Berkeley /s/ Albert V.

Following the distribution to the Visitors of materials setting forth the academic and military records of Dr. Shannon, a lengthy discussion ensued which was engaged in by several Visitors including the members of the Nominating Committee. The nominee's views on a number of matters, which the Nominating Committee had elicited through personal interviews, were brought out during the discussion The discussion was terminated at approximately 12:30 P. M. when the Board stood in recess until 3:00 P. M. ELECTION OF DR. EDGAR FINLEY SHANNON, JR. AS PRESIDENT On resuming its deliberations at 3:00 P. M., the Board unanimously adopted the following resolution RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dr. Edgar Finley Shannon, Jr. be and he is hereby elected President of the University of Virginia. The date of Dr. Shannon's assumption of the Presidency will be determined by the Board at a subsequent time not later than the Annual Meeting in June. RESOLUTION OF THANKS TO NOMINATING COMMITTEE AND ITS SECRETARY On motion of General Montague, duly seconded, the following resolution was adopted RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we express our sincere appreciation to our Rector, Mr. Talbott, and to our fellow Visitors, Judge Smith, Judge Bryan, Mr. Berkeley, Mr. McWane, and Dr. Pollock, for their superior services incident to making a nomination for the high office of President of the University of Virginia. We wish also to thank Mr. Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., for his distinguished work as Secretary of the Committee. PRESENTATION OF PRESIDENT-ELECT SHANNON TO THE BOARD Dr. Shannon was escorted to the meeting room of the Board of Visitors by the Rector who presented him to the Visitors. ANNOUNCEMENT OF RECEPTION FOR THE PRESIDENT-ELECT The Rector then announced that Governor J. Lindsay Almond, Jr. was waiting to meet the President-Elect and to escort him across the Lawn to the Colonnade Club where the Deans of the College and the Schools, the Provost, the Chancellor of Mary Washington College, the President of the Alumni Association, the Comptroller, the Librarian, and distinguished visitors were waiting to greet Dr. Shannon. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - On motion the meeting was then adjourned.

This committee consisted of Dean C. C. Abbott, Graduate School of Business Administration, Professor J. M. Buchanan, School of Commerce, Professor H. C. Dillard, School of Law, Dean T. K. Fitz Patrick, School of Architecture, Professor R. K. Gooch, College of Arts and Sciences, Professor C. Henderson, School of Engineering, Professor B. S. Leavell, School of Medicine, Professor R. A. Meade, School of Education, Dean Margaret Tyson, School of Nursing, and Professor W. S. Weedon (Chairman), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. On 14 June the President's resignation was presented to the Board and on the same date this committee, consisting of Visitors Berkeley, Bryan, McWane, Pollock, Smith, and Talbott, was created. The services of Mr. Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., formerly Secretary to the Board, were sought as Secretary of this committee and, fortunately for us, Mr. Berkeley accepted. Being impressed with the magnitude and overwhelming importance of its assignment, the committee was prepared to proceed at once with its work. FIRST MEETING - At its first meeting, convened on 14 June, your committee joined with the Steering Committee of the Senate Advisory Committee, consisting of Professor William S. Weedon as Chairman and Professors Hardy C. Dillard, Robert K. Gooch, and Charles Henderson. At this time your committee, in agreement with the Steering Committee of the Faculty group, arrived at the unanimous conclusion that certain basic qualifications should be sought in any nominee presented by us to this Board. WE AGREED THAT WE SHOULD LOOK FOR A MAN WHO HAD ATTAINED DISTINCTION AS A SCHOLAR, PREFERABLY IN THE FIELD OF LIBERAL ARTS, AND THE ABILITY TO REPRESENT AND ENGENDER RESPECT FOR THE VALUES OF HIGHER EDUCATION, THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEMS OF VIRGINIA AND THE SOUTH WITH RESPECT TO INTEGRATION, THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ACQUIRE AN INFLUENTIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES OF THE STATE AND TO CREATE A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION IN PUBLIC ADDRESS, THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DELEGATE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY AND TO CREATE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT IN RELATIONS WITH THE STUDENT BODY. WE AGREED AS A MATTER OF PREFERENCE THAT HE SHOULD BE A MARRIED MAN AND THAT THE IDEAL AGE WOULD BE IN THE NEIGHBOR HOOD OF FIFTY, OR YOUNGER THAN THAT IF THE OTHER QUALIFICATIONS WERE FOUND TO EXIST. Subsequently in our screening operations the age qualification was modified by a decision not to consider nominees born prior to 1904, in the absence of unusual circumstances. In determining the age qualification your committee felt that any nominee past the age referred to would not have sufficient time prior to retirement to achieve maximum usefulness. Related to decisions reached at the first meeting is the subject matter of the "Report from the Special Committee of the University Senate", a copy of which has been heretofore given to the members of the Board. This document was impressive in its underlying reasoning and was a valuable reference for basic study of our problem. At this same meeting we also reached an understanding with the Faculty Advisory Committee as to procedures to be followed, which are reflected in the remaining portions of this report. REQUESTS FOR ADVICE AND SUGGESTIONS - On 16 June the Senate Committee addressed a circular letter to all Faculty members, soliciting advice, suggestions, and nominations. On the same date the Rector, as chairman of the committee, addressed a letter to Lawrence Lewis, Jr., President of the Alumni Association of the University, requesting that he circularize all alumni chapters to the same effect, and this was done. Simultaneously the committee received and proceeded to study the files of Mr. T. Benjamin Gay, a former member of this Board, which reflected the activities of the Visitors' committee in its selection of President Darden in 1947, and the files of Mr. McWane showing procedure on selection of the Chancellor of Mary Washington College in 1955. Following a prearranged plan the committee addressed letters to Mr. Arthur S. Adams, President of the American Council on Education, Mr. Henry T. Heald, President of the Ford Foundation, and Mr. Dean Rusk, President of the Rockefeller Foundation, asking their advice on the problem before us. During the months of June, July, August, September, October, and November individual members of the committee or its Secretary had personal interviews for the same purpose with Dean Rusk of the Rockefeller Foundation, James A. Perkins of the Carnegie Foundation, ex-President of Princeton University, Harold W. Dodds, Henry M. Wriston, ex-President of Brown University, President John A. Perkins of the University of Delaware, President Courtney C. Smith of Swarthmore College, and Dr. Robert M. Lester, Director of the Southern Fellowships Fund at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. All of these persons were regarded by us as having intimate acquaintance with the nature of our problem and with prominent figures in educational circles who might be considered eligible to fill the position of President of the University of Virginia. At a special meeting called for the purpose the Raven Society of the University developed a "Report on Qualifications of a University President", which was filed with the committee, received with respect, and studied with interest. The Committee, also on solicitation, received advice from Dr. Pauline G. King, Chairman of the Faculty General Cooperative Committee at Mary Washington College, the Clinch Valley Chapter of the American Association of University Professors, J. N. G. Finley, Director of the Northern Virginia Center, and Dr. Oliver C. Carmichael, the distinguished Southern educator whose advice had also proved useful to the Visitors' Committee of 1947 which nominated Mr. Darden to the Board. THE SELECTIVE PROCESS - As a result of the efforts recited above and the general publicity attendant on the need for choice of a new President, nominations came in from faculty, alumni, friends of the University, and the specially informed sources whose advice we had sought. All these nominations were referred automatically to the Faculty Advisory Committee, which acted as a screening group. All of them were measured against the qualifications previously established and except in a few special instances all of those born prior to 1904 were rejected as ineligible. The Faculty Committee has reported the results of its screening activities periodically to this committee, which has studied and evaluated such reports. The total number of nominations received was 161. Of these more than 60 were rejected because of age requirements and other apparent and compelling reasons. With respect to those remaining, biographical material and other available information with regard to each nominee was assembled and put in written form for study by this committee and by the Faculty Advisory Committee As a result of the above procedure, prolonged discussions at six meetings of this committee, including three joint sessions with the Steering Committee of the Faculty Advisory Committee, organized correspondence between members of this committee, and personal interviews by members of your committee with distinguished educators and others whom we considered to have pertinent information available, the number of potential nominees was reduced by 8 November to eleven. Your committee then began by personal interviews with the group remaining and by the assembly of additional intimate information from available sources to screen this group further. By 17 January your committee had completed its personal discussions with all of them. On Sunday morning, 18 January, we met for a four-hour session devoted to discussion of the names then under consideration. As a result of these deliberations the number of nominees in active consideration was reduced to four On these remaining four nominees your committee and its Secretary have since worked constantly in an effort to gather any facts bearing on their careers which might be pertinent to our decision. The information so assembled has been derived from study of their records, both academic and otherwise, interviews with educators and others familiar with their performance in undergraduate, postgraduate, and subsequent phases of their careers. Detailed examination of military service records has been made where available. The results of our investigations concerning these four nominees have been communicated orally to the Board. REVIEW - It is not possible in this report to review completely the details of the day-to-day work of the Visitors' and Faculty's committees from June 1958 through February 1959. It is pertinent, however, to record that there have been twelve meetings of your full committee since its appointment on 14 June, that members of your committee and its Secretary have had (in addition to formal discussions with nominees at committee meetings) twenty personal interviews with distinguished educators and others concerning problems before the committee and qualifications of the nominees from time to time under consideration, and that we have studied and evaluated six reports on their screening operations submitted by the Faculty Advisory group, representing an outlay of time and thought on their part which must be equal to or greater than that involved in our own deliberations CONCLUSION - Acting now with benefit of the cumulative effect of the work that has been done, the advice received from outside sources, and, most important of all, the advice and consideration of representatives of our own Faculty group, we are prepared to recommend for election as our next President Dr. Edgar Finley Shannon, Jr. We have searched far and have finally come to you with a man from home, who is a native Virginian, for the past three years a member of the faculty of the Department of English at this University. Measuring him by the qualifications first set out as our guide, he has, notwithstanding his relative youth, attained distinction as a scholar, and that in the field of liberal arts, he unquestionably has the ability to represent and engender respect for the values of higher education, with the background of a Virginia breeding and undergraduate education, he has a sympathetic understanding of the problems of Virginia and the South with respect to integration. The record of his military service of five years in the United States Navy, which included combat duty in practically every major action in the Pacific theater, indicates qualities of leadership and the kind of executive ability required of the office of President in dealing with governmental authorities and with internal administration. In our oral presentation we have given you details concerning his undergraduate and postgraduate life, his work as a Rhodes scholar at Merton College, Oxford, in fellowship study at Leeds and London Universities, and as a member of the faculty and tutorial staff at Harvard. His wife, herself a Southerner, a holder of the B.A. and M.A. degrees, a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and formerly Dean of Women at Southwestern College, Memphis, is equipped to give invaluable aid to him if he is chosen as our President We believe that we are fortunate to find among our own a young man whose past performance indicates so clearly the qualities which we have sought. We believe that Dr. Shannon in the position of President will deserve and receive the strong and enthusiastic support of our faculty and we unanimously recommend his election Dated 28 February 1959. /s/ Norborne Berkeley Norborne Berkeley /s/ Albert V.
