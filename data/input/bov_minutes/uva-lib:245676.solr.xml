      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, November 15, 1883 Present: Wyatt M. Elliott, Rector; and Messrs Bell, Ruggles, Hansbrough, and Colo G.T.Barbee, who, by appointment of the Governor, takes the place of Judge Paul, resigned. The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved. Colo Barbee was appointed a member of the following committees, vice Judge Paul: the Finance Committee, the Committee on Grounds and Buildings, and the Committee on Examination of Students. Resolved, That in the appointment of a person to fill the Chair of Chemistry in the University of Viginia, recently vacated by the resignation of Prof: John W. Mallet, this Board has the exclusive right of selection and appointment. The undersigned members of the Committee on Schools respectfully submit that they have considered the subject with which they have been charged so far as limited opportunities have enabled them to do so; and report 1st That the manifest design of the late Samuel Miller, whose philanthropic bequest for the support and maintenance of a School of Experimental and Practical Agriculture to be established at and in the University of Virginia by the authorities thereof, the course and methods of instruction in said School to be prescribed and regulated by the proper authorities of the said University, has not been realized during the preceding administration of the said fund, but has lain dormant through unproductive management, disclosing the shadow instead of the spirit of industrial progress. 2nd The undersigned members of your Committee therefore respectfully recommend that a cordial conference be held between the Proctor and Visitors of the University of Virginia and the trustees of the Miller Fund, or a Committee of each, as may be preferred, at the earliest day practicable for the reorganization of said School and the administration of its interests in conformity with the intentions of the Philanthropic donor, and the achievements of Agricultural Science during the current age. (Signed) Daniel Ruggles. G.W. Hansbrough. F.S. Blair. Committee: Messrs Ruggles, Bell and Hansbrough. Committee on part of Miller Board: Mr Slaughter, President, and Messrs Barbour and Minor. Present: Messrs Ruffin and Taylor Colo: Barbee presented the name and credentials of Prof Woodville Latham for the Chair of Chemistry, and requested that the fact be noted in the minutes, which is accordingly done. Genl: Ruggles nominated Prof C.W. Dabney for the Chair of Chemistry, and voted for him. Whereas, a vacancy exists in the Professorship of Chemistry in this University by the regignation of Dr John W. Mallet, now a Professor in the University of Texas, and whereas, Prof: Mallet is now an applicant for election to fill the said vacancy on condition that he receive the same emoluments he formerly received, and perform the same duties he formerly performed as such professor, and on the further condition that he be allowd until the first day of July before entering on the discharge of his duties, Therefore, Resolved, That the said Dr John W. Mallet be and he is hereby unanimously elected to fill the Professorship of Chemistry in this University on the foregoing terms and conditions. The undersigned to whom was referred the letter of resignation of B.R. Eddins, dated November 15, 1883, as Purveyor of Supplies, beg leave to report that they have considered the same, and recommend that said resignation be received to take effect the first of December. They also recommend Wm: P. Mayo as a fit person to supply the place of Purveyor as aforesaid, and that he enter upon the discharge of his duties as such on said first day of December. (Signed) John W. Bell Wm: Roane Ruffin. Whereupon, Wm. P. Mayo is hereby declared to be Purveyor of Supplies from December 1, 1883. Adjourned till tomorrow morning at Ten O.Clock William Lamb Rector pro-tem. Friday, November 16, 1883 Present: Wyatt M. Elliott, Rector, and Messrs Ruggles, Bell, Hansbrough, Ruffin and Barbee. Whereas, it appears from Section 3, Faculty Report, November 15, 1883, that pending the vacancy (so far) in the professorship of Chemistry, Prof Dunnington has, in addition to the duties of his own department of Analytical Chemistry, been delivering lectures with great acceptability to the students; and whereas, some time will elapse before Dr John W. Mallet, who has been elected to fill that vacancy, will be able to enter upon the discharge of his duties. Therefore, be it Resolved, That Prof Dunnington be authorized to act as professor of Chemistry until Dr Mallet enter upon his duties, and that he be paid for his services, in addition to his salary as Adjunct Professor the sum of $200, per working month, with permission to employ at his own cost such chemical assistance as he shall find to be necessary. Whereas, it is proposed to build by general subscription for the uses of the University a separate Chapel to be placed on such site of the grounds of this Institution as may be designated by this Board: Therefore, Resolved, That such Chapel may be erected on such site of said grounds as my be designated by the Committee on Grounds and Buildings and approved by the Executive Committee; but that its erection shall be made under the general supervision of the Proctor and the Chairman of the Faculty. Resolved, That the recommendation contained in section 5, Faculty Report, November 15, 1883, as to Practical Astronomy be adopted; and that a prescribed course in Practical Astronomy, to be agreed upon in a conference of the Professors interested, be considered as the equivalent of the graduate course in either Mathematics or Natural Philosophy for graduates in these schools, who are offering for a Doctorate. Whereas, it appears from section Six, Faculty Report, November 15, 1883, that one of the three Miller Scholarships, authorized by law to be offered annually on competitive examination, namely, what is called the Post-Graduate Scholarship, was not granted at the close of the last session on account of the failure of the candidate to obtain the required standard, and that the money belonging to this scholarship ($333.1/3) remains in the treasury unused: Therefore, Resolved, for the reasons assigned in said section, that the Faculty be authorized to grant a Miller Scholarship for the present session to N. W. Davis, the student who obtained the mark of 924 in the recent examinations for what are called the two annual scholarships. On motion of G. W. Hansbrough. Resolved, That the recommendation concerning Candidates for the Master's Degree, which is contained in section 8, Faculty Report, November 15, 1883, be adopted; and that the Master's Degree be conferred on W.H. Snook, R. C. Taylor, Walker Bowman, C. B. Wallace and Wister Archer (the students named in said section) on the conditions in said section specified. On motion of Colo Ruffin, Resolved, That the Committee on Grounds and Buildings be charged with the care of the monument over the grave of Jefferson, and the grounds around it. Resolved, further, That an appropriation of $25 be allowed as an expenditure to carry out the above resolution, and that the Proctor be authorized to spend said amount if necessary. Resolved 1. That, after the first day of July, 1884, a student, who proposes to lodge in a University dormitory, shall pay in advance the full rent of the same with the privilege of sharing the room and its rent with a fellow student; provided, in case of joint occupancy and of charges, the charge be equitably divided by the Proctor among the joint or successive occupants, so as to obtain not less than the full rent of the dormitory. 2. That every student lodging elsewhere deposit in advance $15 as an indemnity for rent; and that at the close of the session the amount due for unocupied dormitories be estimated and divided equally among the students lodging elsewhere as a charge to each - the remainder, if any, of his deposit being credited in final settlement: provided, said charge for indemnity in no case exceed $15. 3. That existing enactments, insofar as inconsistent with these presents, be and are hereby repealed. Resolved, That the report of the committee, appointed to prepare a memorial to the General Assembly of Virginia praying that there be enacted a statute providing for the assumption by the State of the existing debt of the University, be received and approved; and that the memorial accompanying the report be adopted, and signed by each member of the Board. That a committee of three be appointed by the Rector (in addition to the Rector himself) for the purpose of presenting the memorial to the Assembly and of pressing the enactment of such statute before any committee thereof to which it may be referred. And the Proctor will pay the actual, necessary expenses of the members of the Committee incurred in carrying out the objects of this resolution. Resolved, further, that the said report and memorial be spread upon the minutes of this Board: that the Proctor be directed to have printed 500 copies of the memorial, and that the Chairman of the Faculty cause to be mailed a copy thereof to each member of the Board of Visitors and of the General Assembly and to the Governor of the State, and distribute the remaining copies as he may see proper. Committee: The Rector, and Messrs Hansbrough, Bell and Ruffin. To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia: The Committee, appointed at a former meeting of the Board to draft a memorial to the General Assembly of Virginia praying that it enact a statute assuming the payment by the State of the debt of this Institution which at present amounts to the sum of Eighty-seven Thousand Dollars, respectfully report the following as the memorial of the Rector and Visitors; and we add that in its preparation we were efficiently aided by the learned Professor of Common and Statute Law, John B. Minor, ..D., who, as well as the entire Faculty, warmly concurs in its object and prayer, and in our hope that it will meet with favorable consideration by the Legislature and the people of Virginia. (Signed) G. W. Hansbrough, Chairman. Wm: Roane Ruffin William Lamb November 10, 1883. Memorial. To the General Assembly of Virginia: The Memorial of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia respectfully represents: That your memorialists find that the important Institution, with the care of which they are charged, is seriously hindered in its general usefulness by the oppressive debt under which it labors; and which may be classed under three heads, all evidenced by the bonds of the University, namely: 1. Debt bearing eight per cent interest contracted prior to 1876 $74,500 2. Debt bearing six per cent interest contracted in 1883 $ 5,000 3. Debt bearing no interest, money advanced by Miller Board, 1879 10,000 $89,500 The Act of Assembly of February 26, 1875, appropriating $30,000 per annum for the support of the University requires that "out of the said appropriation of $30,000 all necessary repairs, and the interest on the existing debt shall first be paid, and a sinking fund of $1,000 per annum shall be established and placed under the control of the Board of Visitors to be annually applied to the liquidation of the principal." Under this Act the then existing debt has been reduced from about $87,000 as it was at that date to the above-stated sum of $74,500, but it has been necessary since that time to borrow $15,000, namely: For cases for the Brooks Museum of the Miller Board in 1879 without interest $10,000 For the erection of a residence for the Director of the McCormick Observatory in 1883 at six per cent interest 5,000 $15,000 The subtraction from the yearly income of the University of the sum required to pay the interest on the then existing debt (i.e. #87,000) and to provide the $1,000 of Sinking Fund amounting in the aggregate for the last financial year to about $7,000 (to say nothing of the interest on the debt of $15,000 contracted in 1883) makes it needful, in order to maintain the Institution in even tolerable efficiency, to levy upon the students very burdensome taxes in the shape of heavy matriculation fees, rents, etc., which impair the popularity of the University, and diminish the attendance upon its schools. Your memorialists submit that under these circumstances, the well-being of the University requires that the State should assume the debt of the Institution, and so relieve its revenues of the disastrous charge now resting upon them, and they humbly pray that your honorable body will so enact. It is needless to remind any member of the General Assembly that the Institution was not established for the pecuniary profit, but for the intellectual and moral development of the people and the glory of the State, and can only be maintained in its appropriate and intended efficiency and distinction by reasonable expenditures of the public treasure; and the intelligent and patriotic statesman can scarcely doubt the political wisdom of such reasonable expenditures as may be essential to preserve the University's standing in the foremost rank of institution of its class and in a condition consonant with the traditions and destinies of Virginia. The affectionate interest with which, for so many years, the General Assembly and the people of the State have cherished the University - the splendid and peculiar monument to the patriotic forethought of Thomas Jefferson encourages your memorialists to believe that it is only needful to prove that the interposition asked for is really necessary in order to insure a favorable hearing from the Assembly and to invoke the warm approval and sympathy of the people. To that end attention is asked to the statement of receipts and disbursements which accompanies the annual report of this Board. It will be apparent thence that the expenditures have been regulated by a rigid economy, and that they cannot be further contracted without detriment to the public service. If the prayer of your memorialists be granted they think that the University may be made, at materially less cost to its pupils in several particulars, more worthy of its fame, of the memory of its illustrious founder, and the honor and influence of the Commonwealth, whose judicious liberality has reared it to be one of the foremost seats of higher education in all the land. Your memorialists submit, further, that inasmuch as in several of the States from which the University has hitherto derived a liberal support, State Institutions have now been erected where no tuition fees, and merely nominal charges of any kind except for board, are exacted, it is more expedient than ever, not to say indispensable, to reduce all charges at the University, especially of the incidental kind, such as for matriculation etc. to the lowest figure possible. In conclusion, - whilst your memorialists make no question that the existing debt was contracted in the best interests of the Institution, and in view of what was considered a reasonable hope and expectation that a large portion of it would be paid from other resources,- still, in view of the failure to receive these collateral funds, and because it is manifestly inexpedient that Literary Institutions should be hampered by pecuniary embarrassments, Your Memorialists are decidedly of the opinion that, by express enactment, the University should be inhibited in the future from creating any debt, or debts, which in the aggregate shall exceed $10,000 to $15,000 without previous sanction of the General Assembly. And your memorialists will ever pray, etc. (Signed) Wyatt M. Elliott, Rector John W. Bell Daniel Ruggles G. W. Hansbrough W. Roane Ruffin. Endorsed: "On motion, it was unanimously Resolved that the memorial of the Board of Visitors as presented to the Miller Board meets its entire approbation, and demands its heartiest co-operation and union in the prayer of said memorial.

The undersigned members of the Committee on Schools respectfully submit that they have considered the subject with which they have been charged so far as limited opportunities have enabled them to do so; and report 1st That the manifest design of the late Samuel Miller, whose philanthropic bequest for the support and maintenance of a School of Experimental and Practical Agriculture to be established at and in the University of Virginia by the authorities thereof, the course and methods of instruction in said School to be prescribed and regulated by the proper authorities of the said University, has not been realized during the preceding administration of the said fund, but has lain dormant through unproductive management, disclosing the shadow instead of the spirit of industrial progress. 2nd The undersigned members of your Committee therefore respectfully recommend that a cordial conference be held between the Proctor and Visitors of the University of Virginia and the trustees of the Miller Fund, or a Committee of each, as may be preferred, at the earliest day practicable for the reorganization of said School and the administration of its interests in conformity with the intentions of the Philanthropic donor, and the achievements of Agricultural Science during the current age.

      <field name="fulltext">Friday, November 16, 1883 Present: Wyatt M. Elliott, Rector, and Messrs Ruggles, Bell, Hansbrough, Ruffin and Barbee. Whereas, it appears from Section 3, Faculty Report, November 15, 1883, that pending the vacancy (so far) in the professorship of Chemistry, Prof Dunnington has, in addition to the duties of his own department of Analytical Chemistry, been delivering lectures with great acceptability to the students; and whereas, some time will elapse before Dr John W. Mallet, who has been elected to fill that vacancy, will be able to enter upon the discharge of his duties. Therefore, be it Resolved, That Prof Dunnington be authorized to act as professor of Chemistry until Dr Mallet enter upon his duties, and that he be paid for his services, in addition to his salary as Adjunct Professor the sum of $200, per working month, with permission to employ at his own cost such chemical assistance as he shall find to be necessary. Whereas, it is proposed to build by general subscription for the uses of the University a separate Chapel to be placed on such site of the grounds of this Institution as may be designated by this Board: Therefore, Resolved, That such Chapel may be erected on such site of said grounds as my be designated by the Committee on Grounds and Buildings and approved by the Executive Committee; but that its erection shall be made under the general supervision of the Proctor and the Chairman of the Faculty. Resolved, That the recommendation contained in section 5, Faculty Report, November 15, 1883, as to Practical Astronomy be adopted; and that a prescribed course in Practical Astronomy, to be agreed upon in a conference of the Professors interested, be considered as the equivalent of the graduate course in either Mathematics or Natural Philosophy for graduates in these schools, who are offering for a Doctorate. Whereas, it appears from section Six, Faculty Report, November 15, 1883, that one of the three Miller Scholarships, authorized by law to be offered annually on competitive examination, namely, what is called the Post-Graduate Scholarship, was not granted at the close of the last session on account of the failure of the candidate to obtain the required standard, and that the money belonging to this scholarship ($333.1/3) remains in the treasury unused: Therefore, Resolved, for the reasons assigned in said section, that the Faculty be authorized to grant a Miller Scholarship for the present session to N. W. Davis, the student who obtained the mark of 924 in the recent examinations for what are called the two annual scholarships. On motion of G. W. Hansbrough. Resolved, That the recommendation concerning Candidates for the Master's Degree, which is contained in section 8, Faculty Report, November 15, 1883, be adopted; and that the Master's Degree be conferred on W.H. Snook, R. C. Taylor, Walker Bowman, C. B. Wallace and Wister Archer (the students named in said section) on the conditions in said section specified. On motion of Colo Ruffin, Resolved, That the Committee on Grounds and Buildings be charged with the care of the monument over the grave of Jefferson, and the grounds around it. Resolved, further, That an appropriation of $25 be allowed as an expenditure to carry out the above resolution, and that the Proctor be authorized to spend said amount if necessary. Resolved 1. That, after the first day of July, 1884, a student, who proposes to lodge in a University dormitory, shall pay in advance the full rent of the same with the privilege of sharing the room and its rent with a fellow student; provided, in case of joint occupancy and of charges, the charge be equitably divided by the Proctor among the joint or successive occupants, so as to obtain not less than the full rent of the dormitory. 2. That every student lodging elsewhere deposit in advance $15 as an indemnity for rent; and that at the close of the session the amount due for unocupied dormitories be estimated and divided equally among the students lodging elsewhere as a charge to each - the remainder, if any, of his deposit being credited in final settlement: provided, said charge for indemnity in no case exceed $15. 3. That existing enactments, insofar as inconsistent with these presents, be and are hereby repealed. Resolved, That the report of the committee, appointed to prepare a memorial to the General Assembly of Virginia praying that there be enacted a statute providing for the assumption by the State of the existing debt of the University, be received and approved; and that the memorial accompanying the report be adopted, and signed by each member of the Board. That a committee of three be appointed by the Rector (in addition to the Rector himself) for the purpose of presenting the memorial to the Assembly and of pressing the enactment of such statute before any committee thereof to which it may be referred. And the Proctor will pay the actual, necessary expenses of the members of the Committee incurred in carrying out the objects of this resolution. Resolved, further, that the said report and memorial be spread upon the minutes of this Board: that the Proctor be directed to have printed 500 copies of the memorial, and that the Chairman of the Faculty cause to be mailed a copy thereof to each member of the Board of Visitors and of the General Assembly and to the Governor of the State, and distribute the remaining copies as he may see proper.

Minor, ..D., who, as well as the entire Faculty, warmly concurs in its object and prayer, and in our hope that it will meet with favorable consideration by the Legislature and the people of Virginia.

      <field name="fulltext">November 10, 1883. Memorial. To the General Assembly of Virginia: The Memorial of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia respectfully represents: That your memorialists find that the important Institution, with the care of which they are charged, is seriously hindered in its general usefulness by the oppressive debt under which it labors; and which may be classed under three heads, all evidenced by the bonds of the University, namely: 1. Debt bearing eight per cent interest contracted prior to 1876 $74,500 2. Debt bearing six per cent interest contracted in 1883 $ 5,000 3. Debt bearing no interest, money advanced by Miller Board, 1879 10,000 $89,500 The Act of Assembly of February 26, 1875, appropriating $30,000 per annum for the support of the University requires that "out of the said appropriation of $30,000 all necessary repairs, and the interest on the existing debt shall first be paid, and a sinking fund of $1,000 per annum shall be established and placed under the control of the Board of Visitors to be annually applied to the liquidation of the principal." Under this Act the then existing debt has been reduced from about $87,000 as it was at that date to the above-stated sum of $74,500, but it has been necessary since that time to borrow $15,000, namely: For cases for the Brooks Museum of the Miller Board in 1879 without interest $10,000 For the erection of a residence for the Director of the McCormick Observatory in 1883 at six per cent interest 5,000 $15,000 The subtraction from the yearly income of the University of the sum required to pay the interest on the then existing debt (i.e. #87,000) and to provide the $1,000 of Sinking Fund amounting in the aggregate for the last financial year to about $7,000 (to say nothing of the interest on the debt of $15,000 contracted in 1883) makes it needful, in order to maintain the Institution in even tolerable efficiency, to levy upon the students very burdensome taxes in the shape of heavy matriculation fees, rents, etc., which impair the popularity of the University, and diminish the attendance upon its schools. Your memorialists submit that under these circumstances, the well-being of the University requires that the State should assume the debt of the Institution, and so relieve its revenues of the disastrous charge now resting upon them, and they humbly pray that your honorable body will so enact. It is needless to remind any member of the General Assembly that the Institution was not established for the pecuniary profit, but for the intellectual and moral development of the people and the glory of the State, and can only be maintained in its appropriate and intended efficiency and distinction by reasonable expenditures of the public treasure; and the intelligent and patriotic statesman can scarcely doubt the political wisdom of such reasonable expenditures as may be essential to preserve the University's standing in the foremost rank of institution of its class and in a condition consonant with the traditions and destinies of Virginia. The affectionate interest with which, for so many years, the General Assembly and the people of the State have cherished the University - the splendid and peculiar monument to the patriotic forethought of Thomas Jefferson encourages your memorialists to believe that it is only needful to prove that the interposition asked for is really necessary in order to insure a favorable hearing from the Assembly and to invoke the warm approval and sympathy of the people. To that end attention is asked to the statement of receipts and disbursements which accompanies the annual report of this Board. It will be apparent thence that the expenditures have been regulated by a rigid economy, and that they cannot be further contracted without detriment to the public service. If the prayer of your memorialists be granted they think that the University may be made, at materially less cost to its pupils in several particulars, more worthy of its fame, of the memory of its illustrious founder, and the honor and influence of the Commonwealth, whose judicious liberality has reared it to be one of the foremost seats of higher education in all the land. Your memorialists submit, further, that inasmuch as in several of the States from which the University has hitherto derived a liberal support, State Institutions have now been erected where no tuition fees, and merely nominal charges of any kind except for board, are exacted, it is more expedient than ever, not to say indispensable, to reduce all charges at the University, especially of the incidental kind, such as for matriculation etc. to the lowest figure possible. In conclusion, - whilst your memorialists make no question that the existing debt was contracted in the best interests of the Institution, and in view of what was considered a reasonable hope and expectation that a large portion of it would be paid from other resources,- still, in view of the failure to receive these collateral funds, and because it is manifestly inexpedient that Literary Institutions should be hampered by pecuniary embarrassments, Your Memorialists are decidedly of the opinion that, by express enactment, the University should be inhibited in the future from creating any debt, or debts, which in the aggregate shall exceed $10,000 to $15,000 without previous sanction of the General Assembly. And your memorialists will ever pray, etc. (Signed) Wyatt M. Elliott, Rector John W. Bell Daniel Ruggles G. W. Hansbrough W. Roane Ruffin.</field>
