One of these is studying the internal situation, stressing the importance of determining how many faculty members will be required to achieve excellence, another group is working to determine the effect of enrollment on the environment, and a third group is studying what has happened at other universities that have grown to determine whether or not the changes have been beneficial. A report of the Committee's findings will be made to the President. Vice-President Shannon then reported on the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Committee on a School of Public Affairs, headed by Mr. Frederick Mosher. The committee recommends the establishment of a graduate school for public affairs, offering a two year masters degree.

It would be a small school of 125-175 students.

Among the other items reported was the authorization by the Finance Committee of the sale of $17,000 worth of jewelry from the Christian Estate. Dr. Edwin L. Kending, Chairman of the Medical Committee, reported that the graduate programs in Nursing are developing in a most satisfactory manner. There are eight students enrolled in each of the majors.

Wright Harrison, Chairman of the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee, reported that his Committee had heard a report from Dr. James Camp, Director of Student Health. In view of the expressions of interest in the report, Mr. Harrison requested that copies of the report be mailed to members of the Board.

Dan who are co-chairmen of the Residence House Counselors. Mr. Harrison expressed high praise for the constructive work of the Residence House Counselors. A discussion of the forthcoming budget hearings before the House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees of the General Assembly of Virginia followed. Vice-President Crawford advised that some aspects of the budget may be questioned at the hearings. He expressed the view that the testimony of Mr. Philip Chabot, a member of Student Council, may have serious reverberations. An opponent of University enrollment growth, Mr. Chabot testified before the House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees of the General Assembly of Virginia on January 25, 1972.</field>
