The following resolution concerning the suspension of the contingent deposit regulation was adopted: WHEREAS, the establishment of the S.A.T.C. Unit at the University of Virginia for the session 1918-19, made it impracticable to collect from the members of said unit the usual contingent deposit, and WHEREAS, it has been demonstrated to the officers of the University during said session, that the deposit of $10.00, known as the contingent deposit and heretofore required of each student to cover the cost of breakage and damage to property and library fines, with the option to subscribe from said deposit to the Chapel, Magazine, Law Review, and the Virginia Union, is no longer essential for the recovery of damage to property or to protect the library against loss, or to provide working funds for the other activities as mentioned, therefore be it RESOLVED, That the regulation with regard to the contingent deposit be suspended until further directions by the Board.

Our final claim for reimbursement of cost was allowed in the sum of $16,928.65. Section B. Under the final settlement for Section B, we were indebted to the War Department in the sum of $25,281.70, and which represented the excess of payments made by the War Department on monthly vouchers submitted on the basis of the contract over and above the actual costs of conducting said section.

University of Virginia. June 6, 1919. President E. A. Alderman, University of Virginia. Dear President Alderman: I am requested by the Albemarle Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, to advise you that the scholarship now standing in its name was, on June the fifth, named by the Chapter in honor of Lieutenant Robert Hancock Wood, Jr., Aviator U. S. A. As Mrs. Robert Hancock Wood, Sr., is the only member of this Chapter who has lost a son in this war, it is fitting that this memorial should be named for this soldier, a native of Albemarle County and an alumnus of the University of Virginia. Very sincerely. Kate A. Iuttle, Chairman of the Scholarship Committee Albemarle Chapter D. A. R. Upon motion the meeting adjourned. [signed] G. Hatton Rector pro tem. [signed] E. I.

      <field name="fulltext">University, Va. June 9, 1919. The Rector and Visitors, University of Virginia. Gentlemen:- I beg to advise that final settlement has been made between the War Department and the University of Virginia covering contracts for Section A and Section B of the Students' Army Training Corps as follows: Section A. Our final claim for reimbursement of cost was allowed in the sum of $16,928.65. Section B. Under the final settlement for Section B, we were indebted to the War Department in the sum of $25,281.70, and which represented the excess of payments made by the War Department on monthly vouchers submitted on the basis of the contract over and above the actual costs of conducting said section. The final settlement was made for Section B on the basis outlined to the Board at its last meeting by Professor Newcomb, which was to the effect that the University is to retain the buildings and equipment in lieu of the cost of restoration of the golf links, etc. A certified check payable to the Treasurer of the United States for $8,353.04, the difference between the amounts above stated, has been accepted by the War Department in final settlement. Respectfully submitted, E. I. Carruthers, Bursar.</field>
