The University is committed to the principle that equal opportunity in education shall be afforded those seeking admission to and those attending the University, without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, political affiliation, sex, handicap, or age. 2. The Plan does not require and the Board will not approve any compromise of the University's academic requirements for admission or for satisfactory academic performance subsequent to admission in any of the Schools comprising the University. 3. The University will make a good faith effort to achieve the objectives set forth in Table 15 of the Plan for the entering undergraduate classes at the University with the understanding that when these objectives are subsequently recomputed, as provided in the Plan, they will again be analyzed by the University administration and considered for action by the Board. 4. With reference to faculty and administrators, the University will make a good faith effort to achieve the interim objective "that the proportion of blacks hired to fill faculty and administrative vacancies shall not be less than the proportion of black individuals with the credentials required for such positions in the relevant labor market area." In the course of this effort, the University will maintain its requirements of excellence in faculty and administrative personnel. The Board notes that further "objectives will be reviewed periodically to reflect changes and availability." Revisions resulting from any such review will be analyzed by the University administration and considered for action by the Board. 5. In participating in the Plan, the University through its Board of Visitors shall retain sole authority and responsibility for the admission and academic performance requirements and employment policies of the University, subject to the limitations of applicable law.</field>
