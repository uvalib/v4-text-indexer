      <field name="fulltext">STATEMENT ON ROBERT M. O'NEIL'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF INTENTION TO STEP DOWN FROM THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Joshua P. Darden, Jr. Rector of the University of Virginia October 6, 1989 The Board of Visitors and I view this day with a mixture of emotions. We have accepted news of Mr. O'Neil's intention to step down with understanding, because we know the opportunity before him is one of nearly limitless potential. We are proud of Mr. O'Neil's legacy -- the health of the University of Virginia. This summer I said that the University enjoys what arguably is the highest stature of its history in many areas of activity, from academic programming to the quality of student life. That remains true. We are lucky to have Bob O'Neil for at least another academic year and perhaps longer -- he has much he wants to complete and we know he will approach the remaining period of his presidency with his usual energy and dedication. We are pleased that his new post will keep him in the University community, consistent with a tradition for former University of Virginia presidents remaining on the faculty. But mostly we are grateful. The integrity, compassion, and grace demonstrated by Bob and Karen O'Neil, as well as Liza, Peter, David, and Ben O'Neil, has been a model of University leadership. But we are happy that we don't have to say good-bye too soon. At this point, we simply want to acknowledge our appreciation, and prepare to move ahead to the important work that faces the University in the year ahead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT ROBERT M. O'NEIL IN RESPONSE TO THE RECTOR'S STATEMENT The real reason is in fact the one I gave Wednesday afternoon. It is the rare and special opportunity presented by the directorship of the Thomas Jefferson Center. In accepting that position I also deeply appreciate the confidence of the Board of Visitors - shown not only in the Rector's generous comments earlier this afternoon but also in the request that I serve through a term that will permit an orderly transition. I shall continue to give the University my very best efforts as President until the day that transition occurs and will then look forward to aiding my successor as he or she carries on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">STATEMENT BY THE RECTOR The Rector said that Mr. Robert M. O'Neil's resignation as President will be effective December 1, 1990. In case a successor is found earlier, the date may be moved up, but not earlier than July 1, 1990. He announced the membership of a Board Committee to nominate a President. He explained that The Manual of the Board of Visitors provides that the Rector is to serve as Chair of the Search Committee. He said he will serve as Chair until he retires as a Member of the Board of Visitors at the end of February 1990. The Search Committee will be as follows: Joshua P. Darden, Jr., Chairman Charles L. Brown Robert G. Butcher, Jr. N. Thomas Connally, M.D. Edward E. Elson Waller H. Horsley Lemuel E. Lewis Elizabeth D. Morie The Rector said the Committee will rely heavily on faculty, students, and alumni. He expressed the hope that the process can move along promptly. The Rector concluded his statement by saying that every effort will be made to clear up the apparent confusion about the growth issue. He announced that it is the intention of the Board to reach a decision about growth at the January, 1990 meeting. Following a recess for an Executive Session of the Board of Visitors, the Open Session continued at 2:30 p.m., on October 6, 1989.</field>

GUIDELINES FOR UNIVERSITY-RELATED Foundations A. STRUCTURAL GUIDELINES 1. A University-related foundation1 1 All references in the Management Principles and these Guidlelines to University-related Foundations shall include subsidiaries of University-related Foundations as well as the Foundations themselves. (Foundation) is an organization that is created and operated exclusively to benefit the University or one or more of the University's schools or departments. A Foundation as defined for purposes of these Guidelines is one which uses the University's name, consumes University resources, occupies University space, or enters into transactions with the University which require the concurrence of the University. A Foundation has as its purpose one or more of the following: a. To facilitate fund raising programs and contributions from private sources for the benefit of the University or one or more of its schools or departments; b. To manage and invest private gifts and/or property for the benefit of the University or one or more of its schools or departments; or c. To promote, sponsor, and complement educational, scientific, research, charitable, or cultural activities for the benefit of the University or one or more of its schools or departments. 2. Foundations may be created only with the approval of the Board of Visitors after a review of the purpose of the Foundation, its proposed organizational format, and the scope of its activities.2 2 Applicable only to Foundations created on or after October 6, 1989. All other provisions in these Guidlelines are applicable to Foundations whenever created. 3. Each Foundation should select a representative of the Board of Visitors, or a senior administrator of the University designated by the Board of Visitors from the areas supported by the Foundation, to serve on the Foundation's governing board. 4. Each Foundation should establish an Audit Committee to report to the board of the Foundation. 5. Each Foundation's charter and by-laws should provide that in the event of dissolution of the Foundation, the Foundation's assets will be distributed in the best interest of the University and, if applicable, the school or department within the University that the Foundation was created to support. B. GUIDELINES FOR CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE UNIVERSITY 1. Each Foundation should execute a formal agreement specifying the responsibilities of the Foundation, acknowledging coordination of fund raising activities, and including other provisions of general application as may be specified by the Board of Visitors. 2. This formal agreement will contain the following provisions: a. The Foundation will coordinate with the University and its other related organizations all fund raising activities undertaken in the name of the Foundation. b. The Foundation will provide the University with an advance copy of any amendments, additions or deletions to its articles of incorporation or bylaws. c. The University and the Foundation acknowledge the independent status of the Foundation and agree that the University and the State are not liable, and will not be held out by the Foundation as liable, for any of the Foundation's contracts, torts, or other acts or omissions, or those of the Foundation's trustees, directors, officers, members, staff or activity participants. d. All correspondence, solicitations, activities and advertisements concerning the Foundation will be clearly discernible as being from the Foundation and not the University. e. The Foundation will not offer a post-secondary course, seminar, workshop or similar instruction, whether or not for credit, using the name of the University or any of its schools or departments. Any publicity concerning such a course must make clear that it is not being offered by the University or any of its academic departments. f. Funds or gifts payable to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, the University of Virginia, or to any other University component shall be deposited with the University. g. Any transfer of endowments or other assets by the University to the Foundation, or by the Foundation to the University, for management or investment will be formalized in a memorandum of agreement to assure, among other things, that any restrictions governing the future disposition of funds are observed. h. The University will obtain approval from the board of the Foundation, the University's Board of Visitors and the State in order to borrow funds from the Foundation. i. The University is entitled to recover its costs incurred for personnel, use of facilities, or other services provided to the Foundation. j. The University is obligated to comply with the Virginia Public Procurement Act. Even though not required to comply with that Act, the Foundation may deem it advisable and appropriate to employ competitive practices in purchasing goods and services. If the University has agreed in writing to reimburse the Foundation for goods or services acquired on behalf of the University, the Foundation must comply with State procurement requirements. C. FINANCIAL REPORTING GUIDELINES AND AUDIT REQUIREMENTS 1. At the request of the President of the University, the Foundation will forward to him, on an annual basis, a financial report audited by an independent certified public accountant. This report shall include a description of all expenditures by program and an identification of all investments, including real estate. Foundations recording annual revenues less than $50,000 will not be required to present an audited financial report but only a financial report compiled by a qualified accounting firm, including the items previously mentioned. 2. The following items shall supplement the annual financial report to the President of the University: a. Notice of any litigation or threat of litigation brought against the Foundation, its officers or directors. b. Notice of any planned major capital expenditure. c. A copy of each IRS form 990, and 990T if applicable, as filed. d.
