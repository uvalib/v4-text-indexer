"It shall be competent for the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia instead of providing for the appointment of one state student for each senatorial district as at present, to provide for their appointment in such manner and under such regulations as said Board shall deem most promotive of the interests of public education in connexion with the Public Free School System of the State." Resolved That the Executive Committee be requested to apply for the passage of such an act as that above indicated at such time as in their judgment it shall appear judicious to do so. Ordered That the Proctor cause the unplastered room in the pavilion occupied by Prof. Venable to be completed at an expense not exceeding fifty dollars.

June 1st 1872 To the Rector &amp; Visitors of the University of Va. Gentlemen I enclose the financial report of the University for the fiscal year ending May 31st 1872. The total disbursements were $48,841.99 Bal. due May 31st 1871 18,263.04 67,105.03 Total Receipts 63,898.98 Balance against the University $3,206.05 From this balance should be deducted $812 the excess of expenditure in the Agricultural Department-payable out of the July interest. The true deficit on June 1st thus becomes $2,394.05. Total disbursements exclusive of debt paid $41,882.74 Total disbursements exclusive sale of bonds 37,516.85 4,365.89 Deduct as above 812.00 Excess of current Exp. over current receipts for the year. $3,553.89 The receipts from all sources except the sale of bonds for the year closing May 30th 1871 were $48,427.33, showing a falling off in the past year of $10,916.48. Appendix A exhibits the amt of fees received in each School, showing a surplus of $1601.50 carried to Income Account, as against $7,089.52 from the same source last year. Appendix B shows the Infirmary account, leaving a balance to its credit of $289.14, and proving conclusively that it will be entirely selfsustaining at the present charge. The balances should be allowed to accumulate in order to meet extraordinary expenditures for repairs &amp;c that may be required from time to time. Appendix C gives the expenditures of the Miller Fund. It is to be noted that the appropriations made by the Trustees always include more or less of the July interest. Last year in included all- this year, owing to the uncertainty in regard to interest on State Bonds, it only included $812. Appendix D is an estimate of the expenditures for the ensuing fiscal year, Those marked with an are dependent upon the action of your Board, and will be modified accordingly. Those marked with a may be considered as fixed and indespensable. Those unmarked are variable and conjectural, but cannot vary widely from the estimate. No account is taken of expenditures out of the Miller Fund. Of the various items ennumerated only those of Repairs &amp; Improvements, Labour, and a small portion of the Contingent are under my control. Appendix E contains a detailed statement of the existing debt, amounting in all to $90,806.05 of this sum $10,144.05 is now due. To meet this I have negotiated $4,150 of bonds leaving a balance of $5,994.05 unprovided for. I can readily make provision for this debt until next summer. During the fiscal year just closed the following Bonds have been negotiated, Viz: 3 8 per cent coupon bonds of $1000 each exchanged for $3000 of the Martha Randolph Debt. Thirty (30) 8 per cent coupon bonds of $1000 sold at 90&amp;cent; in the dollar, with a brokerage of 1 per cent added. Interest was paid on all the floating debt at the rate of 10 per &amp;cent;. For further information on the subject of the debt I would respectfully refer to a paper on the subject forwarded to your Board at its May meeting. The fiscal year not being closed when that paper was prepared the figures were conjectural, and will therefore be found to differ slightly from those now submitted, but in the main the statements are correct. I would call your attention to the necessity of procuring, at an early day, an Act of the General Assembly to make some person at the University ex officio a Justice of the Peace- his jurisdiction to be limited to the University Precincts and a distance of say 1/4 of a mile beyond. This would relieve us of many of the difficulties that now attend the preservation of order and of property. Your attention is again called to the propriety of removing the stables and other Buildings in front of Mr. Jeffries boarding house, and converting the grounds into a Lawn. The resaons are obvious, and were stated in my last annual report. It is, of course, useless at present to make any recommendations looking to the expenditure of money beyond what is necessary for the actual preservation of the property. Enclosed will be found a statement for the Trustees of the Miller Fund, and also the annual report of the Commissioner of Accounts. Very Respy. G. Peyton P &amp; Supt.</field>
