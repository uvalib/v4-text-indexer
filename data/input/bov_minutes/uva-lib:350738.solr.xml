HOSPITAL DEFICIT President Darden stated that he had an appointment with the Governor next week to discuss this matter, and that the Director of the hospital estimated that during the biennium the deficit would exceed $600,000. The President pointed out that it might be necessary to close a part of the hospital if the Governor would not authorize the deficit. Concern was expressed by various members of the Board at the possibility that part of the hospital might have to be closed. The President was requested to ask the Governor for a deficit authorization and, if that were not forthcoming, to advise the Governor what part of the hospital would have to be closed to stay within the appropriation. The President was requested to ask the Governor to support legislation to require the localities to reimburse the hospital for the cost of caring for the indigents of the respective localities. ATHLETIC COMMITTEE REPORT Mr. Talbott, Chairman of the Athletic Committee, presented the report of this committee. He stated that the committee wished to make several changes in the language of the report but that he would read it as it had been prepared. After discussing the matter at considerable length, the Board requested the committee to bring the final report to the October meeting. FIRST-YEAR STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN VARSITY ATHLETICS Mr. Carrington asked that the Board consider the possibility of lifting the ban of first-year students participating in varsity athletics. Mr. Carrington stated that all of the teams whom we have scheduled in football would use freshmen and that it handicapped our coaches not to be able to do likewise. The President stated that the Athletic Director had not raised with him the question of participation of first-year students in varsity athletics for the current session. It is important that all requests come through the Director of Athletics to the President for presentation to the Board. The President pointed out that the Athletic Director had appeared before the University Senate last year and asked that the ban be lifted for the 1951-52 session only. In bringing his request, the Athletic Director stated that neither he nor his coaches would come back to the Senate and request a further extension of the ban. After discussing the matter, a resolution was adopted requesting the President to confer with the Director of Athletics and such other persons as he deems proper concerning freshman participation in varsity athletics, and to make a report to the Board at a special meeting to be held when called by The Rector.

Allan Perkins over the years in dealing with the problems of this, and preceding Boards of Visitors. His wise counsel has been grounded not only on sound legal reasoning, but also on his own broad philosophy. His service has been animated by a love of the University undiluted by selfishness. THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the labors of W. Allan Perkins have been of great and lasting benefit to the University of Virginia and that the members of this Board hereby record the appreciation of those who have had the privilege of serving and working with him. PROPOSED JOSEPH HENRY TOWLE MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP The President presented the following proposal for the establishment of a scholarship by members of the family of the late Joseph Henry Towle: Name: The Joseph Henry Towle Memorial Scholarship. Emolument: $500 per annum. Subject to renewal on a yearly basis at the sole discretion of the donor. Tenure: One year. The original recipient shall have preference for renewal, up to a maximum of four years' tenure. Selection: Authority for selecting the recipient of the award shall be vested in the President and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia. Criteria: The award shall be open to students in any department of the University, with preference to students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Department of Engineering, in that order. The original recipient shall be a student of academic promise and high moral character. To be eligible for renewal, the original recipient shall maintain satisfactory academic standing and add by participation to the betterment of student life at the University, all within the standards and judgment of the scholarship committee. The financial need of the recipient shall be a factor only where two or more candidates are so outstanding in required intellectual and moral qualities that it is difficult otherwise to decide between them. OBJECTIVES: It is hoped that this American student will, whatever his ultimate calling, always serve with great devotion the principles of our Constitution of the United States and the individual liberty it protects. It is further hoped this student will be reminded that, in his day of full responsibility, other deserving students will need his help in turn. A resolution was adopted by the Board establishing the Joseph Henry Towle Memorial Scholarship, and the Secretary was instructed to write a letter of appreciation to the Towle family for this generous gift to the University. PROPOSED EDWARD R. STETTINIUS SCHOLARSHIP FUND President Darden presented a proposal from the Seven Society which Dean Lewis had transmitted to him, concerning the change in the Seven Society Loan Fund to the Edward R.

The Edward R. Stettinius Scholarship will consist of an annual award of $500 to be awarded to an entering student each year, and not renewable. The Scholarship will be administered in the usual way by the Scholarship Committee, which is instructed to notify the recipient of the source from which the money comes, and the person whom it memorializes, and to inform the Seven Society by letter of the name of the recipient.

FRANCES THOMPSON TRUST FUND The will of Frances Thompson, former librarian at Mary Washington College dated July 1, 1927, and probated April 5, 1928, provides that after her daughter becomes twenty-five years of age the proceeds of the trust fund would go to the college providing scholarships known as the Mary and Frances Thompson Fund. The daughter became twenty-five in 1944 and a trust fund of approximately $850 is held by the Virginia Trust Company of Richmond, Virginia. The Virginia Trust Company, substitute trustee of this fund, is anxious to get rid of it and has proposed that the court be petitioned to relieve the said Virginia Trust Company from the responsibility of this fund and such responsibility for the administration of this fund be transferred to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia for the benefit of Mary Washington College. The Board adopted a resolution referring the matter to the Attorney for the University with the request that the Secretary advise him that the Board of Visitors approved this transfer.
