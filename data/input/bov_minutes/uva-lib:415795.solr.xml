The foregoing request was disposed of in the following resolution adopted: RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that a request from the Engineering Department for the erection of two temporary structures, one to house an electronics laboratory and a sanitary engineering laboratory and the other to house an aeronautical engines laboratory, be and the same is hereby approved.

The list was referred back to the Bursar with suggestion that he write to banks in the communities in which the parents or other endorsers are living and ascertain their financial responsibility or if the parents who were comakers of the note had received life insurance that might enable the payment of the notes without working a hardship on the parents. REPORT OF BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS COMMITTEE: Mr. Garnett made a verbal report for the Buildings and Grounds Committee and stated that full meeting of the committee would be held on January 9th when it was hoped that the Rector could be present.

DOCTOR TROUT'S REPORT ON WOODROW WILSON HOSPITAL: Doctor Trout, Chairman of the Board's Committee on the Medical School, stated that pursuant to the Board's prior request, he had recently investigated the possibility of the University's making use of the Woodrow Wilson Hospital at Staunton, Virginia, for housing the Medical School of the University of Virginia, in view of the fact that it was being offered by the United States Government as surplus property, and it was thought could likely be obtained by the University at nominal cost. Doctor Trout stated that after fully investigating the matter and conferring with Doctor Miller, Superintendent of the State Board of Education, who was considering a similar proposal on behalf of the State for that organization, he was satisfied that the use of Woodrow Wilson Hospital by the Medical School of the University was not feasible and recommended that it be no longer considered in this connection.
