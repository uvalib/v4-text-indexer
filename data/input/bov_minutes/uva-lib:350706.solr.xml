ACADEMIC TITLES IN DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE President Darden presented the following letter from Dr. Vernon W. Lippard, Dean of the Department of Medicine. The suggestions made by Dr. Lippard were approved. January 10, 1950 Dear Mr. Darden: Over the years, a confusing situation has developed in the use of academic titles in the Department of Medicine. The word "clinical" is used in some titles and omitted in the titles of others who have similar responsibilities and salary arrangements, residents have been listed in the announcement as instructors without approval of the President or Board of Visitors, there has been no designation for research workers on temporary appointments and paid from funds obtained from outside sources. With the approval of the Advisory Council of the Department of Medicine, may I submit for your consideration the following recommendations: 1. The titles should be as follows Professor Associate Professor Associate Clinical Professor Assistant Professor Assistant Clinical Professor Instructor Clinical Instructor Research Associate Research Assistant Lecturer Assistant Fellow 2. The titles which include the designation "clinical" should be reserved for members of the faculty who are in practice or associated with other institutions in Charlottesville and devote only part of their time to work at the University Hospital and Department of Medicine. 3. The title "research associate" should designate those who have the qualifications for academic rank of associate or full professor but are appointed on a temporary basis and paid from funds obtained from outside sources. 4. The title "research assistant" should designate those who have the qualifications for academic rank of instructor or assistant professor but are appointed on a temporary basis and paid from funds obtained from outside sources. 5. The title "lecturer" should designate those who are associated with institutions outside of Charlottesville, such as the Roanoke Veterans Hospital, but have regular teaching assignments. 6. The title "assistant" should designate members of the resident staff who assist in teaching. 7. The title "fellow" should designate those who have training fellowships financed by funds from either the University or outside agencies. Although there is not complete uniformity in academic titles at medical schools throughout the country, the above recommendations are in keeping with the most common practice Sincerely yours, (s) Vernon W. Lippard Vernon W. Lippard, M. D. Dean BRICK FOR UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS Members of the Board stated that they had received letters from the secretary of the Virginia Brick Association protesting the selection of brick for the new dormitories. The President pointed out that the Board at its October 1949 meeting had given the architects authority to select the brick for the dormitories The President stated that the specifications for the Academic Building would permit the Board to select any brick it wished, prior to the time construction was begun. After considerable discussion of the various types of brick, it was - RESOLVED that the selection of brick for the various University buildings to be constructed be left to the President, in consultation with the Buildings and Grounds Committee of the Board and the architects MEDICAL COMMITTEE REPORT Mr. Garnett, Chairman of the Medical Committee, presented a verbal report on a study of the University Hospital's contract with Virginia Hospital Service Association (the Blue Cross). The following resolution was adopted RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that this Board strongly endorses the petition of Virginia Hospital Service Association (the Blue Cross) to be presented to the State Corporation Commission requesting permission to increase its rates to enable it to pay the member hospitals the cost of providing medical care under its service contracts. BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS COMMITTEE REPORT Mr. Garnett, Chairman of the Buildings and Grounds Committee, reported that the Committee had requested Mr. Campbell and the Secretary to prepare a plan for the architectural treatment of The Mews which would be submitted to the Board at the April meeting. DEVELOPMENT FUND Mr. Anderson, Chairman of the Development Fund Committee, presented the following report, which was approved. REPORT TO THE BOARD OF VISITORS RECOMMENDING A PROGRAM FOR CONTINUING THE WORK BEGUN BY THE DEVELOPMENT FUND Your Committee, consisting of the Rector, Barron F. Black, Thomas B. Gay and E. C. Anderson, Chairman, have had the subject of this report under consideration for more than a year. On May 13, 1949, the Committee recommended that an office of publicity, public relations and fund-raising be created and that a suitable person be found to direct all activities of this office. Up to the present time, it has not been possible to find a person qualified to assume the position, and, therefore, your Committee offers the following suggestion as a substitute and as a method for carrying on the work begun by the Development Fund until a more permanent arrangement can be made. Your Committee believes that it is desirable to terminate the activities of the Development Fund, other than the collection of unpaid pledges. By so doing, future fund-raising activities will not be restricted by the objectives set up for the Development Fund and greater freedom of action will be gained. Your Committee suggests that an organization known as Mister Jefferson's Sponsors be created, that the President of the University become president of Mister Jefferson's Sponsors, that the Development Fund Committee of the Board become the Executive Committee of Mister Jefferson's Sponsors and that it invite the Alumni Board of Managers to name two members, who will become members of the Executive Committee of Mister Jefferson's Sponsors. The rotation of these alumni representatives might be made in any manner in which the Alumni Board of Managers elected Your Committee recommends that the Executive Committee elect Mr. Knox Turnbull of Charlottesville as Executive Vice President of Mister Jefferson's Sponsors and that the Board of Visitors assume the expense, not in excess of $10,000, for one year to maintain an office and staff at the University for the Executive Vice President. The Board made this appropriation at the February meeting. In this connection, we suggest that collections of Development Fund pledges be carried on in this office and that an appropriate charge be made for this service. It is recommended that the Executive Committee meet at least twice a year, and our idea is that from time to time this Committee would become active in an effort to raise money for any objective which they may decide upon. Your Committee suggests that Mr. Powell-Tuck, or some similar person, be retained as consultant, and that he confer with the Executive Committee at stated intervals during the year in order to review the work that is going on and to develop a continuing program. For the immediate present, your Committee recommends that as soon as Mr. Turnbull can get his office organized that he go to work on the Development Fund organization throughout the country in an effort to enroll them and to have them enroll others as Mister Jefferson's Sponsors. The goal might be set at 1,000 members who would agree to join and to pay $100 per year into a fund which, with the approval of the Executive Committee, would be spent at the discretion of the President to provide and to supplement professors' salaries at the University. Furthermore, the membership of Mister Jefferson's Sponsors would agree to do what they were able to do to further the welfare of the University, and by organized effort to endeavor to interest wealth individuals and corporations in giving to the University. Particular objectives might be set for the entire group or projects of special interest for a part of the group. It would be desirable to have some significant goal each year. Your Committee recommends further that the Board of Visitors or the Executive Committee of Mister Jefferson's Sponsors work out some suitable method for recognizing the benefactors of the University. Thought might be given to the holding of exercises of a suitable nature at the University to honor these benefactors and to present to them some testimonial. With proper publicity and planning and with speakers of national or international standing, a very significant occasion might be created. This report is not intended to limit the activities of Mister Jefferson's Sponsors or even to insist on the use of that name. It is a recommendation for continuing the fund raising activities on a long range basis which were begun by the Development Fund Respectfully submitted, (s) Edward C. Anderson Edward C. Anderson, Chairman Barron F. Black Thomas B. Gay ATHLETICS The President reported that he had been unable to reach an agreement with Coach Art Guepe concerning a three-year football contract, and he requested instructions from the Board. Whereupon, it was resolved that Art Guepe be offered a contract for three years at $9,000 for the first year, with an annual increment of $250 per year, and that he be given authority to employ his own assistants from year to year, subject to the approval of appropriate authority. -â-â- On motion the meeting was then adjourned.

Thought might be given to the holding of exercises of a suitable nature at the University to honor these benefactors and to present to them some testimonial. With proper publicity and planning and with speakers of national or international standing, a very significant occasion might be created. This report is not intended to limit the activities of Mister Jefferson's Sponsors or even to insist on the use of that name. It is a recommendation for continuing the fund raising activities on a long range basis which were begun by the Development Fund Respectfully submitted, (s) Edward C. Anderson Edward C.
