DESCRIPTION OF GENERAL PROGRAM 1. That graduate courses in Physics be established in cooperation with the scientific staff of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics at Langley Field. 2. That the content of these courses be essentially the same or equivalent to those given in the Graduate School of Physics at the University of Virginia. 3. That the Physics Faculty at Virginia be charged with the responsibility of keeping the content and standards of these courses equivalent to those at the University. 4. That research leading toward the Master's degree in Physics carried out at Langley Field under the joint supervision and approval of the Langley Field scientists and the Physics staff at Virginia be acceptable upon completion for the Master's thesis. 5. That the present one year's residence requirement at the University for the Master's degree in Physics be waived and there be substituted in its place the following: A. One semester or its equivalent in summer school residence work at the University of Virginia be required for the Master's degree in Physics. B. The remaining work for completing the Master's degree requirements must be taken at Langley Field or at the University of Virginia. 6. All other requirements except the residence requirement (5 above) for the Master's degree in Physics to remain the same as at present. This obviously includes such things as the present language requirements, final examinations to be given by a Committee of the Physics Faculty, and so forth. 7. That instructors for the graduate work at Langley Field be recruited primarily from the staff of the Langley Laboratory subject to the approval of the Faculty of the School of Physics and the Dean of the Graduate School.

Houston, Chairman of the Compliance Committee, National Collegiate Athletic Association. March 9, 1950 Dear President Darden: If it is your desire, as we hope it is, to eliminate the finding of non-compliance of your institution with the provisions of Article III, Section 4, of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Constitution, namely, the Sanity Code, you may submit to this Committee the following (1) A written statement over your signature that your institution is now in compliance with the above provisions. (2) Answers to the questions contained in the enclosed Supplemental Request for Information. In answering this Request you are entitled at your option to substitute in Question #5 the required information concerning the members of your present Varsity and Freshman Basketball teams instead of the Varsity and Freshman Football teams. It is not necessary that you give any answers to Question #4 unless you so desire. You will recall that interpretations of the Code are contained in the Sanity Code Handbook. If you contemplate furnishing the above information, I suggest that it be done without delay. An extra copy of the questionnaire is enclosed for your files. Cordially yours, (s) Clarence P. Houston Clarence P. Houston COMMITTEE APPOINTMENTS The Rector announced that he was appointing Mrs. Smith to replace Mrs. Wailes on the Buildings and Grounds Committee. Dr. Emmett was added to the Medical Committee and made Chairman of that Committee. RILEY BEQUEST A letter from the Attorney for the City of Falls Church, Virginia concerning the possible purchase of a part of the Joseph Harvey Riley property was presented by Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University. The matter was referred to Mr. Garnett with the request that it be studied and a report made at the next meeting of the Board. SALE OF LAND ON LANE ROAD TO W. B. RUSSELL This matter was presented by Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University. Mr. Perkins stated to the Board that by an Act of the General Assembly approved April 4, 1950 (House Bill No. 564) the University was authorized to sell and convey to William B. Russell on such terms and conditions as the Board of Visitors may determine and subject to the approval of the Governor, a strip of land now owned by the University situated on the south side of Lane Road and fully described in said Act, and that said Russell has made an offer of $100.00 cash for said small strip of land which is a fair and adequate price for same. Mr. Perkins also presented to the Board a deed by which said strip of land is to be conveyed to said William B. Russell for $100.00 cash, which deed has been approved by the Honorable John S. Battle, Governor of Virginia, as evidenced by his signature affixed thereto. It was, thereupon, RESOLVED that Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to execute said deed in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and Vincent Shea, Secretary of this Board, is instructed to affix the corporate seal thereto and to deliver said deed to said William B. Russell upon payment by him of the sum of $100.00. KAPRIELIAN BEQUEST Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, reported that he had been to Connecticut in regard to a bequest to the University from H. Kruger Kaprielian, and that he had employed counsel to represent the University in the settlement of the estate. He estimates that the University will receive between $65,000 and $70,000 from this bequest, the income from which is to be used to provide scholarships for students of Armenian descent. HUMPHREYS BEQUEST Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, reported that he had made a trip to West Virginia to investigate the property of the late Dr. William Jackson Humphreys, and that he did not believe the University could carry out the wishes of the donor. He requested the Rector to appoint a committee to study Dr. Humphreys' will and to report to the Board. The Rector appointed the following committee: Messrs. Gravatt and Talbott. DEFINITION OF VIRGINIA STUDENT A report was made by a special committee, consisting of Mr. Gravatt as chairman, Mrs. Wailes, and Mr. Howard, which had been appointed to study the regulations concerning the classification of students as Virginians or non-Virginians. The recommendations of the Committee, embodied in the following report, were approved. REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE UPON PROPOSED CHANGE IN REGULATION FOR ADMISSION AS A VIRGINIA STUDENT The act of the General Assembly adopted March 27, 1936 limiting and defining the powers of the Board upon this subject is as follows. "Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia, That no person shall be entitled to the admission privileges, or the reduced tuition charges, or any other privileges accorded by law only to residents or citizens of Virginia, in the State Universities, Colleges and other institutions of higher learning unless such person has been a bona fide citizen or resident of Virginia for a period of at least one year prior to admission to said institution, provided that the governing boards of such institutions may require longer periods of residence and may set up additional requirements for admitting students." The present regulation adopted by the Board of Visitors June 15, 1925 is as follows "Registration as Virginia Student. — In order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be "under twenty-one years of age; or if he has attained his majority, that he himself be domiciled in the State; and that either his parents or the applicant for admission shall have been a bona fide taxpayer in the State of Virginia for at least two years prior to said application." A new regulation suggested for adoption by Professor Charles P. Nash of the Law Faculty is as follows: "In order to be considered a Virginia student for any given semester, it is necessary that the applicant be domiciled in the State of Virginia for at least one year immediately preceding the beginning of said semester." The changes effected by the suggested regulation are as follows (1) Elimination of requirement that the applicant or his parents be taxpayers in the State of Virginia. (2) Elimination of any reference to the domicile of the applicant's parents. (3) Elimination of any confusion as to the period of domicile necessary by definitely fixing a one year period. A letter of Professor Nash, dated October 31, 1949, addressed to the Rector is attached to this report. As to number (1) - This committee concurs in the opinion of Professor Nash that the tax requirement of the present regulation is of doubtful legality and should be omitted as a requirement for admission as a Virginia student. As to number (2) - The committee is further of the opinion that the requirement that the applicant's parents be domiciled in Virginia should be eliminated. As a general rule the domicile of an infant follows that of his parents. It is recognized that complications may arise where there is a divorce situation, orphanage or the like. There are numerous cases involving such situations which will supply reasonable guidance for a fair and lawful determination of the student's domicile in such situations which doubtless would be more satisfactory than could be attained by any regulation which we might propose. It is also to be noted that the act of the Assembly requires only, "that such person (the applicant) has been" domiciled in Virginia "for a period of at least one year etc." The requirement, therefore, by regulation of the Board, that both parents be domiciled in Virginia is of doubtful legality except in so far as the domicile of the parents controls the domicile of a minor child. As to number (3) - Your committee is of the opinion that the domicile period should be definitely fixed in any regulation adopted by the Board on this subject. The present situation of confusion results from a failure to specify a definite minimum residence period and the additional requirement that the parents or the applicant be taxpayers for a period of two years. Your committee believes that since the act of the General Assembly requires only domicile for one year that the Board should require in its regulation only a one year domicile period unless there are substantial reasons for requiring a longer period of domicile. Your committee knows of no such reasons and, therefore, recommends this change. For the reasons above stated your committee recommends the adoption of the new regulation as suggested by Professor Nash. Respectfully submitted, - - - UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Department of Law Charlottesville, Va. October 31, 1949 Mr. Barron F. Black Citizens Bank Building Norfolk 10, Virginia Dear Mr. Black: I have your letter of October 17th in regard to the University regulation which defines Virginia students. A copy of the regulation which appeared for the first time in the University of Virginia Record of 1925-26 is enclosed. I am also enclosing a copy of the Virginia statute of 1936 on the subject. The statute requires that a person be domiciled in Virginia for at least one year in order to be classified as a Virginia Student, with the proviso that the Board of Visitors may require a longer period of residence (domicile). It is also provided that the Board may set up additional requirements for admitting students. The University regulation requires that the applicant be domiciled in Virginia, and that the parents of the student be bona fide taxpayers to the State for at least two years prior to making application for admission. There seems to be only one case in which one of these university regulations was passed upon by the Courts. The case is Bryan v. Regents of University of California (Cal.) 205 Pac. 1071. The one year domicile requirement was upheld. The plaintiff, who had been domiciled in California for eleven months, and was, therefore, a citizen of the state, contended that the regulation was unreasonable. The Court referred to the California statute requiring domicile for one year as a prerequisite to voting, which is similar to our Virginia statute. It seems clear enough that the one year domicile requirement is valid. I have grave doubts, however, as to the tax requirement. This part of the regulation may cause a person to wait for about two and three-fourth years after he becomes a citizen of Virginia to be classified as a Virginia student in the University. For example: X acquired a domicile in Virginia January 5, 1949. He would owe no taxes to the State in 1949. In 1950 he pays taxes to Virginia for the first time. So after having a Virginia domicile and being a citizen of Virginia for about two and three-fourth years he could be classified as a Virginia student. On the other hand, another person who becomes domiciled in Virginia on January 1, 1950, about a year later than X, could also be classified as a Virginia student in the fall of 1951. The statute provides for (1) admission privileges, (2) reduced tuition charges, and (3) any other privileges. The requirement of domicile for one year applies to all these privileges and by the terms of the statute may be extended by the Board to a longer period. However, the last clause of the statute ("and may set up additional requirements for admitting students") refers only to admission privileges. A court might very well hold that even though the Board of Visitors has power to extend the period of domicile as affecting the classification of students, any additional requirements can affect only admission privileges. It is my opinion that the regulation should be amended by omitting the tax requirement. A suggested regulation is enclosed. Sincerely yours, (s) Chas. P. Nash, Jr. MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE MATTERS LETTER FROM PROFESSOR MCINTOSH A letter from Professor Clifton B. McIntosh of Mary Washington College was presented by the Rector. The letter was referred to the Mary Washington College Committee with the request that a report be made to the Board at the May meeting. KITCHEN EQUIPMENT FOR DINING HALL AND INFIRMARY President Darden presented the following letter. The resolution proposed by Mr. Woodward was adopted, authorizing the execution of contracts based on the low bids for this equipment. April 12, 1950 Dear Mr. Darden: I appreciate so much your willingness to submit to the Board for us a tabulation of the bids on the Kitchen equipment for the College Dining Hall and new Infirmary Building. I attach herewith a tabulation of the bids together with our recommendations. It is my understanding that you are discontinuing the operation of your laundry and using the central laundry at the Women's Farm in Goochland. We are extremely interested in and in need of Laundry equipment. I will be very grateful to you if you could give us an opportunity to purchase from you any equipment which may be surplus to your needs that is adaptable to our use. I will appreciate any consideration that you can give us in this regard. Cordially yours, (s) Edgar E. Woodward Edgar E. Woodward Bursar (Mary Washington College) - - - 4/12/50 On March 29th, bids were received for the kitchen equipment for the College Dining Hall and the new Infirmary Building. The construction contracts for the additional wings for the Dining Hall were awarded several months ago. Due to the fact that specifications were not completed for the kitchen equipment, this could not be included with the general contract. There is still another contract to be awarded for the necessary plumbing to receive the new equipment in the existing section of the Kitchen. The status of the contracts awarded for the project is shown as follows: Virginia Ice Machine Co. (refrigeration equipment) $ 23,831.00 C. E. Nuckles (General Contractor for Construction) 324,593.00 Federal Mfg. Co. (Kitchen Equipment) 45,885.00 Architect's fees - Estimated 24,000.00 Total $418,309.00 You will recall that the bids which were received on January 3rd for the Kitchen equipment for the new Infirmary Building were rejected with the hope that purchasing this equipment along with the Dining Hall equipment, a saving would be effected. We are pleased to report that by doing so, it enabled us to save $569.00 on the cost of this equipment. For your convenience, the status of the new Infirmary Building project is shown as follows: R. H. Wattinger (General Contractor for Construction) $231,000.00 Art Metal Company (Cabinets and Shelving) 11,810.00 American Sterilizer Company 2,316.00 Straus &amp; Co.

It is recommended, therefore, that the following action be taken RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President of Mary Washington College be and is hereby authorized to award and execute contracts with the Federal Manufacturing Company in the amount of $45,885.00 for kitchen equipment for the main dining hall for the College and the Straus Company for $6,800.00 for kitchen equipment for the new Infirmary Building. - - - On motion the meeting was then adjourned.

      <field name="fulltext">UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Department of Law Charlottesville, Va. October 31, 1949 Mr. Barron F. Black Citizens Bank Building Norfolk 10, Virginia Dear Mr. Black: I have your letter of October 17th in regard to the University regulation which defines Virginia students. A copy of the regulation which appeared for the first time in the University of Virginia Record of 1925-26 is enclosed. I am also enclosing a copy of the Virginia statute of 1936 on the subject. The statute requires that a person be domiciled in Virginia for at least one year in order to be classified as a Virginia Student, with the proviso that the Board of Visitors may require a longer period of residence (domicile). It is also provided that the Board may set up additional requirements for admitting students. The University regulation requires that the applicant be domiciled in Virginia, and that the parents of the student be bona fide taxpayers to the State for at least two years prior to making application for admission. There seems to be only one case in which one of these university regulations was passed upon by the Courts. The case is Bryan v. Regents of University of California (Cal.) 205 Pac. 1071. The one year domicile requirement was upheld. The plaintiff, who had been domiciled in California for eleven months, and was, therefore, a citizen of the state, contended that the regulation was unreasonable. The Court referred to the California statute requiring domicile for one year as a prerequisite to voting, which is similar to our Virginia statute. It seems clear enough that the one year domicile requirement is valid. I have grave doubts, however, as to the tax requirement. This part of the regulation may cause a person to wait for about two and three-fourth years after he becomes a citizen of Virginia to be classified as a Virginia student in the University. For example: X acquired a domicile in Virginia January 5, 1949. He would owe no taxes to the State in 1949. In 1950 he pays taxes to Virginia for the first time. So after having a Virginia domicile and being a citizen of Virginia for about two and three-fourth years he could be classified as a Virginia student. On the other hand, another person who becomes domiciled in Virginia on January 1, 1950, about a year later than X, could also be classified as a Virginia student in the fall of 1951. The statute provides for (1) admission privileges, (2) reduced tuition charges, and (3) any other privileges. The requirement of domicile for one year applies to all these privileges and by the terms of the statute may be extended by the Board to a longer period. However, the last clause of the statute ("and may set up additional requirements for admitting students") refers only to admission privileges. A court might very well hold that even though the Board of Visitors has power to extend the period of domicile as affecting the classification of students, any additional requirements can affect only admission privileges. It is my opinion that the regulation should be amended by omitting the tax requirement. A suggested regulation is enclosed. Sincerely yours, (s) Chas. P. Nash, Jr.</field>
