MRS. MAZYCK WILSON SHIELDS ESTATE-DIVISION OF FLORIDA LAND WITH V. M. I. The President stated that he was advised by General Kilbourne, Superintendent of Virginia Military Institute, that the Special Committee appointed by the Board of Visitors of Virginia Military Institute on January 24, 1944, with full authority to lease, partition or sell the Institutes one-half interest in the tracts of land in Marion County, Florida, devised to the Institute and to the University by the will of the late, Mrs. Mazyck Wilson Shields of Washington, D. C., has reached the conclusion that it will be well for the land in question to be divided equally between the University and the Institute. And the Virginia Military Institute Committee has requested us to make choice of either Tract No. 3 or Tract No. 4, Section 27, Township 16 South, Range 20 East, Marion County, Florida, and of either the Eastern or Western half of the 40 acre tract, which latter tract the Institute Committee thinks should be divided equally by a line running North and South through the exact center of the 40 acre tract. The President also stated that pursuant to instructions given to Mr. W. Allan Perkins by Committee of this Board at a meeting held on the 27th of May, Mr. Perkins had gone to Ocala and made a thorough investigation of the lands in question and that under date of June 19th Mr. Perkins had filed a report dealing in detail with the value of the property and the possibility of sale thereon; that Mr. Perkins is further of the opinion that there is absolutely no difference in value of the tracts 3 and 4 or of the Eastern and Western halves of the 40 acre tract, that it was, therefore, entirely immaterial which of these properties is selected by the University and which passes to the Virginia Military Institute. It was, thereupon, - RESOLVED, that the University of Virginia hereby selects Tract No. 3, Township 16 and the Eastern half of said 40 acre tract. And Dr. J. L. Newcomb, President, is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver to Virginia Military Institute a deed of partition by which The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia will convey all right, title and interest held by it in and to Tract No. 4, Block 3, Section 27, Township 16 South, Range 20 E. Marion County, Florida, and the Western half of the SWÂ¼ of the SEÂ¼ of Section 28, Township 16 South, Range 20 E., Marion County, Florida, the consideration for said conveyance to be the conveyance by Virginia Military Institute to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia of all of the right, title and interest of said Institute in and to Tract 3, Block 3, Section 27, Township 16 South, Range 20 E. Marion County, Florida, and the Eastern one-half of the SWÂ¼ of the SEÂ¼ of Section 28 Township 16 South, Range 20 E. in said Marion County, Florida, and E. I. Carruthers, Secretary, is hereby authorized to affix the corporate seal to said deed of partition and to attest the same. F. P. MALLORY LOAN IN THE SEWARD ESTATE: COMPROMISE SETTLEMENT: The President advised the Board that F. P. Mallory, who had borrowed $2,000 from Dr. Walter M. Seward during his lifetime, which security came to the University as part of his bequest, had been reduced to $912.60 with $492.84 of accrued interest, and that he had offered a compromise settlement of the debt by making a cash payment of $1,000, and recommended its acceptance. Acceptance of the offer was approved. MORTGAGE CORPORATION OF VIRGINIA BONDS - PROPOSAL OF SETTLEMENT: The following action was taken in this matter: WHEREAS, this Board has received and considered letters, dated June 15, 1944, from the Mortgage Corporation of Virginia, to Mortgage Corporation of Virginia Collateral Trust bondholders, of whom the University of Virginia is one, advising that the University abandon the present plan and now fully complete the liquidation of said bonds by calling upon the First and Merchants National Bank of Richmond, Virginia, Trustee, to sell the collateral, which can be done inasmuch as a default exists under the terms of the Collateral Trust Agreement, and, after selling the collateral, the Trustee would then distribute the net cash proceeds pro rata to the bondholders as a final payment in the liquidation. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED: That this plan of redemption is approved, and that R. Gray Williams, Rector of the University of Virginia, is authorized and directed to execute, in duplicate, letters, addressed to First and Merchants National Bank of Richmond, as Trustee, authorizing the Trustee to sell the collateral at public auction when holders of not less than 20% in unpaid principal amount of outstanding bonds in Series 1X, Series 2X, Series 4X, Series 9X and Series 14X have so requested. BUDGET FOR 1944-45: The President presented his financial budget for the fiscal year 1944-45, copies of which had been mailed to all members of the Board some days in advance of this meeting, showing estimated receipts for the year of $3,473,720 and expenditures of $3,416,892, with estimated surplus of $56,828, which was adopted. The meeting then adjourned. R. Gray Williams Rector. E. I. Carruthersa Secretary.</field>
