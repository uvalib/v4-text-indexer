      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia, January 29th, 1914. A called meeting of the Board of Visitors was held on this date, with the following members present: Rector Gordon, Judge Norton, John W. Craddock, Ceo. R. B. Michie and R. C. Stearnes. The meeting was called for 10:30 A.M., but a quorum was not secured until the arrival of Mr. Stearnes at 6:10 P.M. Pending the arrival of Mr. Stearnes, the members discussed several matters, among which was the bill for the establishment of a woman's college co-ordinate with the University, now pending in the legistlature. It appeared to the members present, that the bill now before the Legislature did not meet the conditions as set forth in a resolution of the Hoard at its meeting on January 5th, and therefore would not prove satisfactory in its present shape. The question of action by this meeting looking to the passage of another resolution was considered and the Chair ruled that as this meeting had not been called for that purpose, and that as there were present only five members whereas there was a full Board at the time the former action was had, he would entertain no motion looking to further action at this meeting, but, if the members saw fit, they could draw up a papger to meet their views and sign it as individuals. Such paper was executed, but did not constitute a part of the minutes. The proposed merger of the Medical Department of the University with the Medical College of Virginia, which was the principal matter for consideration at this meeting, was called up. The Committee, consisting of Rector Gordon, Mr. Craddock and Dr. Whitehead, appointed at the last meeting of the Board to visit New York in conjunction with a similar Committee from the Medical College of Virginia, together with Dr. Alderman, with a view of determining whether or not the contemplated endowment could be secured for the merged school, made its report. After hearing from each of the committee present, it was felt that the question of endowment was extremely uncertain, and that it would be unwise to proceed with the proposed enabling act under the circumstances. The matter was disposed of in the following resolution offered by Mr. Craddock and unanimously adopted:- Resolved: That in view of the fact that the Rector and Visitors of the University have diligently sought, and have entirely failed to obtain assurances satisfactory to said Rector and Visitors, of receiving such an endowment fund from outside parties, as is contemplated by the articles of agreement heretofore entered into between the authorities of the Medical College of Virginia and the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, looking to the immediate consolidation of said Medical College of Virginia and the Medical Department of the University to be located at Richmond, as the Medical Department of the University, it is the sense of this Board, that it is inexpedient and unwise to proceed further in the direction of such consolidation. The question of creating temporarily, the office of Alumni Recorder was brought up by Dr. Page, Acting President, and the following offered by Judge Norton, was adopted:- Resolved: First, that for the six months, beginning January 1st, 1914, an officer to be known as the Alumni Recorder be employed by the University, and that it shall be his duty to promote a reunion of alumni at the Finals of 1914, and to do such other work in connection with the alumni as may be prescribed for him by the President of the University and the Chairman of the Executive Committee of this Board. Second, That the President of the University and the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors appoint the incumbent of the above mentioned office and fix his salary at a sum not exceeding $150.00 a month, beginning January 1, 1914, together with $75.00            (or as much thereof as may be necessary) a month, additional for office expenses. In accordance with the above resolutions, on February 3rd, 1914, the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors, and the Dean (Acting President) of the University, appointed Mr. Lewis D. Crenshaw Alumni Recorder, for the six months, beginning January 1, 1914. (It should be noted that the appointment is made as of January 1, 1914, on account of the fact that for some six months Mr. Lewis D. Crenshaw did, at odd times, work for the University for which he received no remuneration. The following letter was received from the Chairman of the Library Committee, together with the accompanying letters. Same were received, and ordered spread. University of Virginia, Jan. 6, 1914. To the Rector and Visitors of The University of Virginia. Dear Sirs:- Having learned through Dr. Booker of Balitmore that Dr. W. P. Morgan was on the point of bestowing his library upon some institution, Dr. Harry T. Marshall conveyed to me, as Chairman of the Library Committee, this information. After an exchange of letters with Dr. Morgan Dr. Marshall and myself visited him at his home, 315 Monument Street, Baltimore—with the result that he presented to us his entire collection of books, claiming the right to reserve some of the books for his own use as long as he should live. In order to put this gift in more tangible form, there followed two letters, copies of which I am now filing with you. I am not sure that this is in legal shape, but I did not feel at liberty to push the matter further, in view of Dr. Morgan's cordial beneficence. Yours very truly, (signed) Charles W. Kent. 315 Monument Street, Dec. 12, 191 Dr. C. W. Kent, Chairman Library Committee. Dear Sir:- At the solicitation of Dr. William D. Booker of Baltimore and Dr. Harry T. Marshall of the University of Virginia, I offer my library to the University of Virginia, according to the terms agreed upon by yourself and Yrs. truly, (signed) Dr. Wilbur P. Morgan. University, Virginia, Dec. 17th, 1913. Dr. Wilbur P. Morgan, 315 Monument Street Baltimore, Md. Dear Dr. Morgan:- At the meeting of our Library Committee yesterday afternoon I read them your letter of December 12, in which you state that at the solicitation of Dr. William D. Booker, of Baltimore, and Dr. Harry T. Marshall, of the University of Virginia, you offer your library to the University of Virginia, according to the terms agreed upon by yourself and me as Chairman of the Library Committee. The Committee was exceedingly gratified at this generous offer, and authorized me to inform you that it accepts with great delight your library, and agrees heartily to the conditions that you be permitted to retain such books as you desire, and have them sent to us at your convenience. Very sincerely yours, (signed) Charles W. Kent. The Secretary presented the following communication from Herbert Noble, Trustee, in the Frances L. Wilson estate. Noble, Estabrook &amp; McHarg 115 Broadway, New York, Jan. 21, 1914 University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va. Dear Sirs:- (re-Estate Frances L. Wilson, deceased.) I have had submitted to me an offer of $1000, for the unexpired term of the lease No. 44 West Fiftieth Street, New York City, belonging to this Estate. I have kept in constant touch with the real estate market concerning leases like this one, and this offer is the best one and in fact, the only one I have been able to obtain during a period of over a year. I am advised by reliable real estate agents who are familiar with the value of lease holds in that neighborhood, that this offer is the best I could possibly get under the circumstances, and I am advised by them that it would be wise to accept it. I have ascertained that a lease for the same unexpired term as this one, to a house located on the same street, with a frontage only one foot narrower and at a yearly rental of only a few dollars less, was sold not long ago for a price considerably less than one-half the price now offered to me. I am therefore submitting this matter to you, and will ask you to let me know if you consent to this sale. The lease in question is, as you know, for a period to terminate November 1, 1931, at a rental of $1811.00 a year, and the amount of taxes to be paid yearly is over $900.00. The houseremained unoccupied for over three years, in spite of the fact that every effort was made to secure a tenant. This inability to rent the house is attributable, chiefly to the change in the character of the neighborhood, it having changed from a purely residential section to one where business is carried on, and for this reason, at present, there is no demand for houses in this neighborhood by the wealthy class of people. Moreover, the house while tenantable would require considerable repairs before it is acceptable, and the Estate is not at present financially able to make this outlay. The lease in question was offered at Auction sale on May 28, 1912, but it had to be withdrawn as there were no bidders. In September, 1913, I leased the house for the nominal rent of $1,800.00., a year, for a period of three years, with a cancellation clause of sixty days which can be exercised by me at any time. I did this in order to minimize the loss which the estate has been suffering during all the time this house has remained unoccupied. As the matter stands now, the house costs the Estate in the neighborhood of $2800.00 a year to carry, and the income derived from it is only $1800.00 a year, thereby causing the Estate a loss of approximately $1100.00 a year. After considering the foregoing facts, will you be kind enough to let me know, at your earliest convenience, if you consent to this sale; and I would urge you not to delay this matter any more than it is absolutely indispensable, as the person who has made the offer, while he is willing to wait some time, I fear he may in the meantime find another house that is satisfactory to him. Faithfully yours, (signed) Herbert Noble, As Trustee of the Estate of Frances L. Wilson, deceased. The matter was disposed of in the following resolution offered by Mr. Craddock, and adopted: Resolved: That Herbert Noble, Trustee under the last will and testament of Frances L. Wilson, deceased, duly probated on February 4th, 1908, be and he is hereby authorized to sell the lease-hold at 44 West Fiftieth Street, New York City, belonging to said estate, and which expires November 1, 1931, provided however, that not less than the sum of $1000.00 is secured for the same." The Bursur communicated to the Board the information that he had received from the Rector, January 15th, the following securities devised to the University by the late Col. Js. H. Skinner of Staunton; the Rector having been duly authorized to receipt to the Executors on behalf of the University for same: Skinner Securities. January 15th, 1914. Par Value Market 16—$100, Registered Va 3's 1,600 2— 500, Registered Va 3's 1,000 11,492 8—1000, Registered Va 3's 8,000 6— 500, Coupon Va 3,000 1—1000, United States Registered 4's 1,000 1,110 75 1—500, United States Coupon 3's 500 510 1— 100, City of Staunton, 3 1/2's 100 85 1— 500, City of Staunton, 4's 500 450 1— 500, City of Staunton, 4 1/2's 500 500 8 shares National Valley Bank, 800 2,000 11 shares Augusta National Bank, 1,100 2,750 Par 18,100 18,897 75 The Bursar requested, that in view of the probability of securing a better investment for the Skinner Scholarship Fund than that now represented by the securities received from the estate for that purpose, the Finance Committee be authorized to make sale of said securities at such time as it may see fit, and that the Rector be empowered to make transfer of such registered Virginia and U. S. Bonds in said fund as are now payable to the Rector and Visitors, whereupon the following offered by Judge Norton was adopted: Resolved: That the Finance Committee be authorized in its descretion, and at such time as said Committee shall deem advisable, make sale and transfer of the Virginia bonds derived from the estate of Col. Js. H. Skinner, under his will, and that the Rector be authorized in the name of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, to execute and deliver, upon the request of said Finance Committee, a proper power of attorney, authorizing the Virginia Trust Company of Richmond, Virginia to make transfer of said bonds. Whereas, James H. Skinner, late of the City of Staunton, Va., by his last will and testament devised his property real and personal to Jos. A. Waddell and Alex. F. Robertson, Trustees., upon trust that his sister Fanny Skinner, should received the income arising therefrom during her natural life, and at her death that said Trustees should convey transfer and turn over said property to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia; and whereas said Fanny Skinner died on Nov. 8, 1913, and said Trustees by deed bearing date on January 17, 1914, conveyed to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia all the real estate devised to them as aforesaid, consisting of one office building, and an undivided half interest in a store house, a residence property and certain lots, all situated in the City of Staunton, Va., and fully described in said deed: And whereas, the other half of said property was owned by Fanny Skinner at the time of her death, who by her will authorized her Executors to sell any or all of her property publicly or privately: And whereas, it is desirable that the property conveyed to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and especially the undivided interest, should be sold at the same time that the undivided interest of Fanny Skinner, dec'd., is sold, therefore, Resolved: That A. C. Gordon, Rector of the University of Virginia be and he is hereby authorized to sell either publicly or privately and upon such terms as to the payment of the purchase money as he shall deem best any or all of said real estate conveyed to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and to execute and deliver a proper deed or deeds therefor, in the name of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, (and) to which deeds the Secretary will affix the seal of said Corporation. Any unpaid purchase money is to be secured by a vendor's lien or a cotemporaneous deed of trust upon the property sold. Resolved, further, That Armisteed C. Gordon be requested to act as attorney to represent the interests of the University in any partition suit that it may be necessary to bring, but without compensation for his legal services from the University. This provision, however, shall not be construed to prevent said Gordon from acting as a joint commissioner of sale, and receiving such commissions as the law allows its commissioners as officers of the court. Prof. W. M. Thornton, Dean of the Engineering Department, sent to the Board a request for the re-appropriation of the unexpended surplus of the appropriation for his department for the fiscal year ending July 1, 1913, said appropriation being for special machinery, etc., all the invoices for which were not received prior to closing the books for the fiscal year. Pursuant with the foregoing, the following by Mr. Michie was adopted; Resolved: That the sum of $607.59 be and is hereby re-appropriated for the Engineering Department for the fiscal year ending July 1, 1914. The Secretary stated to the Board that the Record book now in use for the minutes of the Board was nearly filled, and asked for permission to install a system by which the minutes could be recorded by typewriter with a black record ribbon, rendering them more legible and requiring much less space to record them, thereby necessitating use of fewer records and adding greatly to the facility for preserving the valuable proceedings of the body. The request, was considered and granted, and the Secretary authorized to install such system when the present book shall have been completed. On motion, the Board adjourned, without date. E. I. Carruthers, Secretary. Armistead C. Gordon, Rector.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Noble, Estabrook &amp; McHarg 115 Broadway, New York, Jan. 21, 1914 University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va. Dear Sirs:- (re-Estate Frances L. Wilson, deceased.) I have had submitted to me an offer of $1000, for the unexpired term of the lease No. 44 West Fiftieth Street, New York City, belonging to this Estate. I have kept in constant touch with the real estate market concerning leases like this one, and this offer is the best one and in fact, the only one I have been able to obtain during a period of over a year. I am advised by reliable real estate agents who are familiar with the value of lease holds in that neighborhood, that this offer is the best I could possibly get under the circumstances, and I am advised by them that it would be wise to accept it. I have ascertained that a lease for the same unexpired term as this one, to a house located on the same street, with a frontage only one foot narrower and at a yearly rental of only a few dollars less, was sold not long ago for a price considerably less than one-half the price now offered to me. I am therefore submitting this matter to you, and will ask you to let me know if you consent to this sale. The lease in question is, as you know, for a period to terminate November 1, 1931, at a rental of $1811.00 a year, and the amount of taxes to be paid yearly is over $900.00. The houseremained unoccupied for over three years, in spite of the fact that every effort was made to secure a tenant. This inability to rent the house is attributable, chiefly to the change in the character of the neighborhood, it having changed from a purely residential section to one where business is carried on, and for this reason, at present, there is no demand for houses in this neighborhood by the wealthy class of people. Moreover, the house while tenantable would require considerable repairs before it is acceptable, and the Estate is not at present financially able to make this outlay. The lease in question was offered at Auction sale on May 28, 1912, but it had to be withdrawn as there were no bidders. In September, 1913, I leased the house for the nominal rent of $1,800.00., a year, for a period of three years, with a cancellation clause of sixty days which can be exercised by me at any time. I did this in order to minimize the loss which the estate has been suffering during all the time this house has remained unoccupied. As the matter stands now, the house costs the Estate in the neighborhood of $2800.00 a year to carry, and the income derived from it is only $1800.00 a year, thereby causing the Estate a loss of approximately $1100.00 a year. After considering the foregoing facts, will you be kind enough to let me know, at your earliest convenience, if you consent to this sale; and I would urge you not to delay this matter any more than it is absolutely indispensable, as the person who has made the offer, while he is willing to wait some time, I fear he may in the meantime find another house that is satisfactory to him. Faithfully yours, (signed) Herbert Noble, As Trustee of the Estate of Frances L. Wilson, deceased.</field>
