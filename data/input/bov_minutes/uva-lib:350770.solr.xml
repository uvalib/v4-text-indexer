See March 11 minutes under same heading] GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION - FUNDS TRANSFER The President laid before the Board a letter from the Comptroller of the University, with attached list of funds, as follows 21 January 1955 Dear Mr. Darden On the enclosed list we have set forth a number of gifts to the Graduate School of Business which, at the time of receipt, were added to the Consolidated Endowment Fund. Now that a separate fund has been established for the Graduate School, I believe it advisable to transfer these funds from the Consolidated Endowment Fund to the new fund. If you concur in the above proposal, please present this matter to the Board at its next meeting, as transfers from the Consolidated Endowment Fund must be authorized by the Board. Very truly yours, /s/ Vincent Shea Vincent Shea, Comptroller VS/lw Mr. Colgate W. Darden, Jr. President University of Virginia (Account #5192) University of Virginia Consolidated Endowment Fund Analysis of Graduate School of Business Endowment As of December 31, 1954 Date Donor Amount 9-30-50 Mathieson Chemical Company $10,000.00 11-30-50 H.

The Board resolved unanimously that the request be granted. ROTUNDA RESTORATION Mrs. Smith reported that the Buildings and Grounds Committee had met on February 11th with the Virginia Art Commission, with all members of the Commission present. Professor Frederick D. Nichols of the School of Architecture had attended the joint meeting by invitation, and had presented photocopies of Jefferson's original architectural drawings for the Rotunda, with photographs and other documentation on the interior of the Rotunda prior to the fire of 27 October 1895 The Art Commission, impressed with the unusual detail of the documentation, and the beauty and functionalism of the original plans, had thereupon adopted the following resolution UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA ROTUNDA. 1. Art Commission approved heartily of the proposal for a restoration of the Rotunda to its original plan and appearance. 2. The data presented indicates that there is ample documentation for a complete and accurate restoration 3. The Commission's action is based on the understanding that this would be a faithful and complete restoration with furnishings and with no considerable compromises. /s/ A. E. Kendrew Feb. 11, 1955 Professor Nichols, Mrs. Smith said, had discussed his ideas for the interior restoration work with Mr. Fiske Kimball, leading living authority on Jefferson's architecture and the neoclassical revival in America. After some hesitation over any tampering with the work of so important an architect as Stanford White, Mr. Kimball had expressed great enthusiasm for Mr. Nichols' proposal. Mr. Kimball had remarked that Jefferson was a greater architect than Stanford White, that the Rotunda was his last great architectural monument, and that Mr. Nichols' functional idea of making the Rotunda the administrative center of the University was strictly in accord with Jefferson's conception of academic architecture. Mrs. Smith noted that the Art Commission's suggestion that the Rotunda be suitably furnished might be costly, and said that her Committee did not recommend any decision or action by the Board at this time. The Board resolved that Mrs. Smith's Report be accepted and approved and that the signed Resolution from the Art Commission be filed with the Secretary. MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE MATTERS LOAN FROM STATE TREASURY The President laid before the Board the following letter and enclosure from President Morgan L. Combs. January 25, 1955 President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. University of Virginia Charlottesville, Virginia Dear Governor Under authority granted by the Governor on November 12, 1954, Mary Washington College has been authorized to borrow from current funds in the State Treasury $1,356,515.57 with interest at the rate of one per centum per annum, beginning January 20, 1955 until paid. You will note that the authorities in Richmond agreed to reduce the rate of interest from one and one-half per cent, which we originally agreed upon, to one per cent. You will also observe that interest on this amount will begin on January 20, 1955 and run until paid. I think we are very fortunate indeed in getting this low rate of interest and having it deferred until January 20, 1955, which saves more than a half-year's interest. I am enclosing herewith the note in the amount and conditions set forth above, and I shall greatly appreciate it if you will present this matter to the Board of Visitors at their next meeting for approval. Cordially yours, /s/ Morgan M. L. Combs, President MLC rej Enclosure cc. Mr. Edg.

This loan is made pursuant to the provisions of Section 46 and 47, Chapter 708 of the Acts of 1954, and the source approved by the Attorney General in a letter to the Governor under date of April 27, 1944. BOARD OF VISITORS UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA BY_______________ The Board resolved after discussion, that the proper officers of the University be authorized to execute a note in the sum and terms set forth in the foregoing statement from the Treasurer of Virginia. CAP AND GOWN RENTALS FOR SCHOLARSHIPS President Darden presented a letter of 2 February 1955 from the Bursar of the College proposing that proceeds of approximately $800 to $900 annually from the rental of caps and gowns purchased on other than State funds be used to provide special scholarships for needy students in good academic standing without regard to Virginia residence, this proposed special scholarship fund to be supplemented by the net proceeds from the forensic tournament held at the College each spring. President Darden warmly endorsed Mr. Woodward's proposal. The Board resolved that the Bursar of the College be authorized to set up the special scholarship fund as proposed in his letter of February 2nd. CAPITAL OUTLAY AUDIT The President stated that the State audit of the College's capital outlay expenditures for the 1949-1954 period appeared to be in order, and that it had been referred by him to the Chairman of the Visitors' Committee on the College, who would presumably report to the Board on it at the March 11th meeting SUMMER SESSION FEES AND CHARGES The President laid before the Board the following proposed schedule of fees and other charges for the Summer Session submitted by the Bursar of the College: EXPENSES FOR SUMMER SESSION (Eight Weeks) Present Proposed General College Fees $27.50 $ 67.50 Library fee 2.50 5.00 Laundry fee 4.50 5.00 Infirmary fee 1.50 1.50 Student activity fee 5.00 5.25 Table board 78.75 78.75 Furnished room 27.00 32.00 Total charge to Residents of Virginia $146.75 $195.00 Tuition for Non-Residents of Virginia 50.00 85.00 Total charge to Non-Residents of Virginia $196.75 $280.00 PART-TIME STUDENTS Minimum charge (1 to 3 hours' credit), $35.00.

No student will be admitted on a part-time basis who registers for more than four semester hours of credit.

The Board resolved that the proposed Schedule be adopted, effective for the Summer Session of 1955. HEATING PLAN FLY ASH CONTROL A general discussion was held on the ash nuisance problem at the College, and consideration was given to proposals for its correction as embraced in drawings of the heating plant and specifications (Institutional Engineering Section, Budget Division, dated February 1, 1955) for an ash silo and accompanying equipment laid before the Board by the President. Mr. Darden said that the specifications incorporated the recommendations of Mr. Fred Saunders, in whom he had great confidence, that the cost would be heavy, probably in the range of $35,000, but that he could see no way of avoiding this expense. The Board resolved that the proper authorities of the University be authorized to obtain bids and proceed with this work in accordance with the specifications submitted. LETTER FROM PRESIDENT COMBS Following a verbal report by Mr. Howard of the February 11th meeting of the Visitors' Committee on the College, an extensive and detailed discussion was held on the present and future administration of the College The Board resolved by unanimous vote that the Rector should reply to Dr. Combs' letter of January 10th, and notify him of the fact that his case has been fully reviewed in the Board and will not be reopened APPOINTMENT OF A DEAN OF WOMEN The function of the Dean of Women and the work of Mrs. Ruby Cook Harris, who is at present acting in that capacity, which had been discussed at length in the Committee, were further considered by the Board. The Board unanimously resolved to postpone the permanent appointment of a Dean of Women and related administrative decisions until the March meeting. -â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â- On motion the meeting was then adjourned Barron F.
