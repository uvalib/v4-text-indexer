      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday July 1st 1845. On this the day, appointed by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia for their stated annual meeting, Thomas J. Randolph and Andrew Stevenson only appeared; and the Board was not organized till Wednesday July 2d, when John H. Cocke, James M. Mason, Wm. C. Rives, &amp; R. M. T. Hunter who was appointed to supply the vacancy in the Visitation occasioned by the resignation of Chapman Johnson, by the appointment of John H. Cocke to the vacant Rectorship, who, having declined the appointment, was made rector, pro temp:, and Joseph C. Cabell was elected Rector in his place. The following Committees were appointed. On the Departments of Natural Philosophy &amp; Chemistry: Messrs. Mason, Randolph &amp; Cocke. On the Library:]Messrs. Stevenson &amp; Hunter. Of Inspection: Messrs. Cocke &amp; Randolph. Of Finance: Messrs. Mason &amp; Hunter. The Committee on the department of Natural Philosophy &amp; Chemistry made their reports. The Board adjourned till tomorrow. Thursday July 3d 1845: The Board met. Present as on yesterday with the addition of Joseph C. Cobell, who appeared at the Board and took his seat as Rector- The following proceedings were had. 1. Resolved, that the application of Mr. Charles Morris, a Student of the University made to the Faculty under date of July 3d 1845, asking to be permitted to take the Degree of Master of Arts, which application has been referred to the Board of Visitors, is deemed reasonable, and that the Faculty be authorised to confer the said Degree on Mr. Morris, he having complied with all the requirements of the Enactments, but having unfortunately lost the thesis which he had prepared in obedience to those enactments. 2. A letter from the Chairman of the Faculty containing a statement of Facts in relation to the application of Mr. Matthew Harrison for the Degree of Master of Arts of the University, was laid before the Board by the Rector. It appears that Mr. Harrison had obtained Diplomas on Antient Languages, Mathematics, Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, French Law &amp; Political Economy, but fail'd in obtaining a degree in Modern Languages. After a full examination of the circumstances connected with Mr. Harrison's case, the Board came to the opinion that the omission to graduate in the school of Modern Languages, ought not to be a bar in this case to his receiving the degree of M.A. but that under the peculiar circumstances of his case the application of Mr. Harrison be deemed reasonable, &amp; that the Faculty be advised of it. 3. Resolved that the Executive Committee be substituted in lieu of that appointed by the resolution of the 5th July 1843 to confer with Mrs. Madison upon the subject of the Books devised by her husband to the University &amp; that the said committee have power to adopt suitable measures to carry into effect the wishes of the illustrious individual towards the Institution as expressed in his last will &amp; testament. The Board adjourned till tomorrow morning. Friday July 4th 1845. The Board met pursuant to adjournment. Present all the Visitors. The following proceedings were had. 1. Resolved that the sum of two thousand dollars, or so much as may be necessary, be applied during the current year in the purchase of $2000 of the Bonds of the University now outstanding. 2. Resolved, that the Bursar purchase so much of the 6 per cent stock of the Commonwealth as will yield six per cent interest on the sum of $1,500 being the amount of the Legacy bequeathed by Mr. Madison to the Library of the University; the said stock to be transferred to the University by it's corporate name, and the dividends accruing thereon to be collected by the Bursar and applied as already directed by order of the Board of Visitors. 3. Resolved that Messrs. Rives &amp; Cabell be appointed a Committee under the 14th resolution of the Board passed the 5th day of July 1843, and that the sum of $300 being the interest for four years on the amount of said legacy or so much thereof as may remain after paying any premium on the purchase of the stock ordered to be made by the preceeding resolution be, and the same is hereby appropriated for the use of the Library to be expended as by the said resolution of the 5th July 1843 is ordered. 4. Resolved that the price of board of Students at the Hotels be reduced to one hundred dollars for the session. 5. Resolved that the commissions of the Patron on the deposits of the Students be limited to sums deposited by them for payment of Board &amp; professors' fees, and that said commissions be no longer charged to the Students, but deducted from the sums so deposited. At 11 A.M. The Board took a recess to attend the exercises of the public day. After they were concluded the Board resumed its labors, &amp; passed the following resolutions. 6.

Resolved- That in the annual report of the Rector &amp; Visitors, it be strongly represented to the general assembly that the interests of the University imperiously require such legislation, as will enable the University to give effect to those enactments interdicting Students who are dismissed, expelled or suspended from remaining within five miles of the precincts. 16. Resolved- That the Students of the Medical School who attend the Lectures of the professor of Chemistry &amp; Materia Medica, shall be charged, for such attendance a fee of fifteen dollars instead of twenty five as hitherto. 17. Resolved- That there be appointed in the anatomical department of the Medical School, a Demonstrator of Anatomy, whose duties shall be particularly defined by the professor of Anatomy and Surgery, subject to the control of the Executive Committee in the recess of the Board, and the Board of Visitors during their session.
