It is further Resolved that this building shall be located on the plat of ground between Minor Hall and Dawson's Row, facing the back of the McIntire Theatre.

The Secretary was directed to spread upon the minutes the letter of President Newcomb of April 22, 1941, to the Governor in the matter of the proposed N. R. O. T. C. Building, as follows: April 22, 1941 Governor James H. Price State Capitol Richmond, Virginia Dear Governor Price: I am authorized and directed by the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia to request you to authorize a deficit appropriation of $40,000.00 upon condition that the Works Project Administration spends an additional $100,000.00 on a building for the Naval Officers' Training Corps Unit at the University of Virginia, the estimated cost of which is $140,000.00. This proposal has been certified by the Secretary of the Navy as necessary for the national defense and the Works Projects Administration has directed us to prepare the necessary plans and specifications upon which to make a detailed estimate of the costs. The building is to be of fire-proof structure and used for classroom purposes. A real emergency exists here in that we have been unable to properly accomodate the unit for the single course held this session. Next year there will be two courses offered, the following year three courses, and in the third year four courses. We are without proper buildings to instruct the naval students. Trusting that this will meet with your approval and that you will authorize us to go ahead with this proposal, I am, Faithfully yours, (Signed) J. L. Newcomb, President.
