SELECTION OF ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS FOR BUILDING PROGRAM: Mr. Corbitt, who represents the University of Virginia on the State Committee charged with the selection of architects and engineers for the building program of the several educational and other State institutions, gave a very full report of the progress being made by the committee and of the difficulties experienced with the appointments for the University. Mr. Lewis Williams, in a general discussion of the matter, brought forward the possibility of having submission of competative sketches by several architects and spoke of the correspondence he had conducted with the possibility of having such plan adopted for our projected buildings. From the general discussion it developed that the meeting was not prepared to take definite action at this time. On motion, adopted, the matter was referred to the New Buildings Committee acting with Mr. Corbitt. THE GOVERNOR REQUESTED TO SET APART 4% OF THE APPROPRIATIONS FOR BUILDINGS TO BE USED FOR ARCHITECTURAL PLANS: The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED that the President of the University request the Governor to release 4% of the appropriations made for buildings at the University and Mary Washington College to be used to secure architectural designs therefor. LUCY JAMES DUN WILL MATTER: The President advised the Board that the Supreme Court of Maryland had reversed the decision of the Circuit Court of Baltimore County in the Lucy James Dun will, and had directed the Safe Deposit Trust Company of Baltimore to turn over that one-third of Mrs. Dun's estate to the Trustees of the Rucker Estate. He further stated that the Trustees would now institute proceedings in the Corporation Court of the City of Charlottesville for a legal construction of Mr. Rucker's will and for guidance in their administration of this fund. The President stated that it was his intention to request the Attorney General to act as counsel for the University in the matter, and in case his office could not appear for the University it would be necessary to have him designate an attorney to do so.
