      <field name="fulltext">PROPOSED REVISIONS TO BOARD OF VISITORS GUIDELINES FOR STUDENT ACTIVITIES CURRENT FUND ALLOCATION The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED that the Student Activities Committee be and it is hereby charged with the authority and responsibility, under the President, for supervision of the Student Activities Fund which is made up of student activities fees. With respect to allocation from the Fund, unless otherwise directed by the President, the procedures shall be as follows: the budgets of all organizations will be reviewed by Student Council and if approved, Student Council will allocate funds from student activities fees to the organizations. Funds may be allocated by Student Council to eligible student organizations in the following categories, The Rector and Visitors having determined that activities in these categories are related to the educational purpose of the University: 1) student governments and councils; 2) co-curricular activities which do not come under the purview of University departments or units; 3) club sports; 4) curricularly-oriented publications, student newspapers and student news magazines; 5) the student radio and television stations; 6) cultural and fine arts activities; 7) the University designated coordinating agency for student volunteer service activities; 8) student clinical training programs; 9) hobby organizations; 10) non-partisan groups whose predominate purpose is to present speakers on a non-partisan basis to speak on topics of probable general interest to the University; 11) student legal services; 12) service organizations; and 13) student organizations acting as spokesman for groups of students protected by federal non-discrimination legislation. "No monies from these funds shall be given: 1) for honoraria or similar fees; 2) for religious activities or activities sponsored by religious organizations; 3) for social entertainment or for organizations whose activities are substantially social; 4) to such organizations as fraternities, sororities or honor societies when admission is exclusionary in nature and not open to all students as well as to any organization when membership is restricted by reason of race, religion, national origin, political affiliation, or sex. Notwithstanding these requirements, a club sport may restrict membership based on sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. Organizations may also make requirements based on writing skills or on vocal range or quality which may result in a chorus or choruses of one or predominantly one sex. In determining cases of discrimination it is not sufficient to look merely to the constitution of such an organization but to its actual practices and operations. 5) for political action purposes, i.e. lobbying or electioneering activities. Lobbying includes any activity the principal purpose of which is to influence the passage or defeat of specific legislation. Electioneering encompasses participating or intervening in any political campaign on-behalf or in opposition to any candidate for public office. These restrictions are not intended to preclude funding of any otherwise eligible student organization which: (1) advocates, as an incidental or insubstantial parts of its activities, the adoption or rejection of legislation; (2) engages in nonpartisan analysis, study, or research, and makes the results available to the public; or (3) espouses particular positions or ideological viewpoints, including those that may be unpopular or are not generally accepted. (6) for activities which would jeopardize the University's status as an organization to which contributions are deductible under Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code. If a governmental inquiry or audit is initiated as a result of an activity of a particular organization that may lead to the imposition of excise taxes or otherwise impair the University's tax-exempt status, the University may suspend, withdraw or discontinue funding to that organization after notice and an opportunity to be heard." The ceiling on the aggregate amount allocated to all such organizations will be the then current total student activities fees. Each organization whose budget is reviewed by the Student Council will have a right of appeal to the Student Activities Committee. Any student or student groups may also appeal to the Student Council and to the Student Activities Committee. The Student Activities Committee shall examine on its own motion any budgets that may be approved by the Student Council for organizations deemed by the committee to be within the categories noted above. If no appeal or motion is taken the Student Council Vice President for Student Organizations writes the chairman of the Student Activities Committee requesting that the allocations for those organizations be released to the Student Activities Business Manager. When the Student Activities Business Manager receives the funds from the University they are deposited into a bank checking account. Expenditures from the allocations can be made provided the student organization completes the proper authorization forms with the Student Activities Business Manager. BE IT RESOLVED that the foregoing amendments to the Guidelines for Student Activities Current Fund Allocation shall apply to all student organization funding requests that are pending on, or are made after, July 1, 1990.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">REPORT OF STATEMENT BY LEIGH B. MIDDLEDITCH, JR. Mr. Middleditch told the Board that he has studied the issue of investments in South Africa with great care. He stated that he is unalterably opposed to apartheid and everything that it represents in the current system in South Africa. He expressed concern that the University take a position in what he deems to be essentially a political issue. He quoted a letter from Professor Jacob Levenson, former Chair of the Proxy Advisory Committee as follows: "Especially on the most urgent question the need to preserve objectivity and neutrality precludes the University from institutionally taking a political position. It remains our conviction that any policy designed to affect the government and society of South Africa should be arrived at by the political process." Mr. Middleditch said that he agreed with the statement. He said he did not want a future Board of Visitors, when they are having to address what he deems to be another sensitive political issue, feel bound by the decision of this Board without knowing that at least there was dissent based on reasons stated. He advised that he would vote against the resolution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REPORT OF STATEMENT BY JESSE B. WILSON, III Mr. Jesse B. Wilson, III, stated that he feels that the University's policy on divestment has been the correct policy, and therefore he would cast his vote against the resolution to totally divest in companies having direct investments in South Africa. On motion, the meeting adjourned at 4:10 p.m. Respectfully submitted, Raymond C. Bice, Jr. Secretary RCB:jb</field>

Approved commitment to the School of Medicine: $ 1,052,000 2. Approved commitment to the College of A. &amp; S.: 1,021,800 Total $ 2,073,800 3. In the case of each school, the approved commitment exceeds the maximum allocation for the fiscal year, which by decision of the Vice President for Business and Finance would be $1,000,000, or $2,000,000 total for the two schools.1 1 Memorandum from LWS to HPK and PRG, 05/01/90 The committee recognized that both schools have at present internally-committed, but unspent Pratt Funds available to them. In each case this sum exceeds the amount over $1 million voted for specific projects during this meeting. The committee, which includes the Dean of Faculty and the Dean of Medicine, therefore voted further thatactual expenditures from funds to be approved by the Board of Visitors inthis round will be held to a total of $2,000,000 during the fiscal year ahead. This means that the amounts in excess of $1,000,000 for each school shown under (1) and (2), above, will be covered by Pratt funds currently committed to the school but not yet spent. The vote in favor of this arrangement was unanimous. 4. The committee voted to request from the Director, Center for Advanced Studies, by the fall of 1990, afull and detailedreport on the status and financial history of the Pratt Fund, the data to be obtained in study of the records and from interviews with those (central administration) financial officers who are in charge of the Fund, together with recommendations for future management and reporting.
