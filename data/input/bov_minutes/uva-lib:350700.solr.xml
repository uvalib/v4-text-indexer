Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, reminded the Board of the fact that by agreement dated April 1, 1922 the University leased to the City of Charlottesville for 99 years a tract of land on which is now located the City's filter plant, and that by a supplemental agreement dated November 11, 1927, certain changes were made in the terms and conditions of the original lease, and that by contract dated April 1, 1944, an additional lot of land was leased to the City by the University so that the filter plant might be enlarged. The City of Charlottesville is now engaged in materially enlarging its plant for filtration of University and City water and desires to lease a small triangular piece of land owned by the University which adjoins the property subject to previous leases on the north or northwest Mr. Perkins presented a form of lease to the Board for its consideration and, upon motion offered by Dr. Trout and seconded by Mrs. Wailes, the following resolution was adopted RESOLVED, that Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President of the University, be and is hereby authorized and instructed to execute the lease above referred to, and Vincent Shea, Secretary of this Board, is instructed to affix the corporate seal and attest the same, and W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, is instructed to see that the lease is properly executed on behalf of the City of Charlottesville, and, after such execution, is recorded in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of Albemarle County, a copy thereof being filed with the minutes of this meeting LLOYD CHURCH ESTATE Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, stated to the Board that the Eighth Article of the Will of the late Judge Lloyd Church, of the City of New York, which was admitted to probate in the Surrogate's Court for the County of New York on November 30, 1948, reads as follows "I give and bequeath the sum of Five Thousand Dollars, ($5,000.00), to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, Virginia, for the general uses of the University". That Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company of New York, the Executor named in the will, qualified as such and now desires to make payment of said legacy to the University, upon execution and delivery by the University of a receipt and release, copy of which was presented by Mr. Perkins to the meeting. The following resolution, proposed by Mr. Garnett and seconded by Mr. Mears, was thereupon unanimously adopted. RESOLVED, that Barron F. Black, Rector, be and is hereby authorized and directed to execute said release in the form presented to the Board, and that W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the Board, is instructed to deliver said executed receipt to Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company of New York, with instructions to send check for the Five Thousand Dollar legacy payable to Vincent Shea, Bursar of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. USE OF PORTION OF WEST MAIN STREET Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, presented the following matter to the Board. The Annexation Order entered by the Circuit Court of Albemarle, November 11, 1938 (see Law Order Book 50, pp. 390-399) provides in part as follows: "It is further ordered, on motion of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, the City of Charlottesville and the County of Albemarle assenting thereto, that the grounds, walks, driveways and all the lands now belonging to said body politic or corporate, the corporate name of which is `The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia', although embraced within the lines set out above, shall nevertheless, be and they are excluded therefrom and shall be, remain, and continue in all respects and for all purposes, a part of the County of Albemarle as fully as if the same were not included within said lines "This exception or reservation, however, shall not apply to any of the lands now used and embraced within the streets and roads known as West Main Street, Fry's Spring Road, the Old Lynchburg Road, Rugby Road, State Highway No. 250 and State Highway No. 29, and the sidewalks thereon, and the right of way of the C. &amp; O. Railroad, and all of said streets, roads and right of way within the boundary lines set out above shall be in and a part of the City of Charlottesville." The question has recently been raised as to whether the above use of the terms "West Main Street" and "State Highway #250" includes the whole width of the road immediately to the east of the Main Gate of the University or whether a triangular piece of this street immediately to the east of the Main Gate and extending along the northeastern boundary of the University grounds in a southeasterly direction from said Main Gate to the western side of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway bridge where it crosses said West Main Street, was intended to be excluded from said description. President Darden then made a statement to the Board in which he expressed the view that from the standpoint of the University as well as from the City, it was quite important that this triangular piece of land be treated as being within the jurisdiction of the City so that the City's parking and traffic regulations might be enforced therein by City authorities. Mr. Perkins then briefly outlined the conditions which attended the adoption by the Court of the Phraseology quoted above in the Annexation Order of November 11, 1938, stating that the phraseology as used was believed by counsel for all parties in interest and by the Court to expressly include this triangular piece of the street within the jurisdiction of the City. It was, thereupon, RESOLVED, that upon advice of counsel, in the opinion of this Board the Annexation Order above referred to, did not exclude from its operations the triangular piece of West Main Street or State Highway No. 250 which lies immediately to the east of the University's Main Gate and extends along the northeastern boundary of the University grounds in a southeasterly direction from said Main Gate to the western side of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway bridge where it crosses said West Main Street, but the whole of said portion of said street or highway and the sidewalks thereon were intended by said Annexation Order to be a part of the City of Charlottesville. SEWARD ESTATE BONDS Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, stated to the Board that upon settlement of the estate of the late Dr. Walter M. Seward, the University received, among other securities, three bonds of Margaret McComb Topham, Margaret Shultz McComb and David Wilkins McComb, one for $3,000, one for $7,000, and one for $15,000, an aggregate of $25,000, all of which bonds were secured by mortgage upon premises known as 303 Washington Street, New York City, the date of payment of said bonds having been extended by an agreement between the makers and Dr. Seward, dated January 3, 1917, to January 1, 1922. Although interest had been paid regularly upon said bonds and by reason of these payments the collection of said bonds was not barred by limitation, your Finance Committee felt that it would be wise to have a new and formal extension agreement executed by Marcelle Hull Littell and Norris Adams, Jr., the present owners of the mortgaged premises, and the University With the aid of Mr. Walter V. Berwick, an associate of the law firm of Jackson, Nash, Brophy, Barringer and Brooks, 15 Broad Street, New York 5, we have had such an extension agreement prepared by which agreement the obligors agree and bind themselves to pay interest upon the principal amount at 3% per annum instead of 5%, as heretofore, from July 1, 1949, and to pay the sum of $250.00 on October 1, 1949, and like sums of $250.00 quarterly thereafter on the first days of January, April, July, and October of each year until the principal indebtedness has been reduced to the sum of $12,000.00, at which time no further amortization shall become due, the full balance of $12,000 to be due and payable on July 1, 1969, when the principal amount is reduced to $12,000.00 by payments as above stated, interest shall be paid thereon at 5% until payment in full is made. This contract has been executed by the said Marcelle Hull Littell and by Norris Adams, Jr., the obligors, in duplicate, and a resolution is now in order authorizing the execution of the contract on behalf of the University. Upon motion proposed by Judge Barksdale and seconded by Mr. Gravatt, it was thereupon unanimously - RESOLVED that Barron F. Black, Rector, be and is hereby authorized to execute said contract in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and acknowledge the same, and Vincent Shea, Secretary of this Board, is directed to affix the corporate seal thereto and attest the same, that both executed copies be then delivered to W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, who shall forward these copies to Messrs.

NCAA REGULATIONS The President presented the following letter from the Compliance Committee of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. September 1, 1949 Dear President Darden: Notice is hereby given to you as President of the University of Virginia that at the next regularly called annual meeting of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, a motion will be made to terminate the active membership of the University of Virginia in accordance with the provisions of Article IV, Section 6(a), of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Constitution The grounds upon which such motion will be based are as follows That the University of Virginia has failed to maintain athletic standards in accordance with the Constitution of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, to wit. Article III, Section 4, clause a, b or c, whichever clause may be applicable thereto, by granting financial aids to athletes which exceed and are in violation of the provisions of the said Section IV This notice is given to you in accordance with Article IV, Section 6 a (1). Very truly yours, (s) Ralph W. Aigler University of Michigan (s) James H. Stewart Southwest Athletic Conference (s) Clarence P. Houston Tufts College (s) James Lynah Chairman of the Panel A general discussion ensued and the President was then asked by Dr. Trout for an expression of his views. He stated that he would like to renew the suggestion made at Richmond at the special meeting of the Board on July 21, 1949, namely, that the University tender its resignation from the Association if it found itself unable to comply with the regulations. The letter was referred to the Athletic Committee with a request that a report be made at the next meeting of the Board. LAMBETH PROPERTY President Darden pointed out that Dr. W. A. Lambeth, for many years a member of the faculty, had left his property to the University, with a life interest vested in his widow. Dr. Lambeth died in 1943 and the residence is badly in need of repair. The Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds has made an estimate of the cost, which amounts to about $5,000. A resolution was adopted authorizing the President to approve such repairs as were necessary, provided expenditures from State funds were found by the University attorney to be legal for such purpose. AWARD TO DR. S. A. MITCHELL A resolution was adopted requesting the Rector to pen and forward to Dr. S. A. Mitchell, Director Emeritus of the Leander McCormick Observatory, a letter in recognition of the Watson Gold Medal awarded to him by the National Academy of Sciences OUTDOOR SWIMMING POOL The President stated that there was some doubt in the minds of the architects as to the advisability of building an outdoor swimming pool in the site of the present reflection pool east of Memorial Gymnasium. The architects have tentatively recommended a site at the foot of Observatory Mountain across Observatory Road from the site of the proposed dormitories. A resolution was adopted authorizing the President, after consultation with the architects, to abandon the proposed site for a swimming pool on the east side of the gymnasium and, if deemed advisable by the architects, to fill in the present reflection pool.
