      <field name="fulltext">REPORT ON DEVELOPMENT President O'Neil reported that the Development activity has remained most encouraging, even after the formal conclusion of the Capital Campaign. The momentum of private gift support continues at record rates, with $35.2 million received in cash during the fiscal year which ended on June 30. That figure is $3 million above the previous year's receipts. He said that we are currently reviewing a wide variety of needs developed by the Deans and their colleagues. A draft of a post-Capital Campaign Development Plan has been prepared by Vice President Peavey and his associates, and is now being circulated for comment. There are many needs that have emerged since the Capital Campaign agenda was developed. Several new Deans have taken office within the past two years, and they must have their input in the process. Other needs have changed significantly since the Campaign took shape. Still other needs were not fully funded during the Campaign, and their status must now be reassessed. Currently Vice President Peavey and Vice President and Provost Floyd are meeting individually with each Dean, and Mr. Peavey and Vice President Muller will be doing the same very soon with the units of the Medical Center. From these discussions and others will emerge a coherent post-Campaign Development plan in which he hopes to have a very substantial and personal role of his own. He also reported on several recent significant gifts to the University. A very substantial state-of-the-art gift of computer equipment, support and personnel from AT&amp;T will greatly enhance our overall University computer capability. This seems destined to be the largest gift ever made by AT&amp;T to a single university. He noted a recently received one million dollars in cash from the estate of Mrs. Charles Younts of Atlanta, to support construction of the Replacement Hospital. A $1 million commitment from an anonymous donor will be placed in a permanent unrestricted endowment. Finally, he said that we will continue to place major emphasis on the funding needed for the $8 million Life Sciences Building. About $1.5 million remains to be raised for this purpose. He said that this facility is absolutely critical for research and advanced study in the life sciences at this University.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REPORT BY THE RECTOR ON THE ACTIONS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE The Rector announced that the following resolutions were adopted by the Executive Committee: (a) Resolution Pledging Certain Endowment Funds to Assure Completion of the University of Virginia Hospitals' Replacement Hospital and Renovation Project WHEREAS, pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia on October 5, 1984, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia (the "University") has commenced a major replacement and renovation project for the University of Virginia Hospitals (the "Project"), as more particularly described in the Official Statement dated May 30, 1985 relating to $95,386,796 Hospital Revenue Refunding Bonds (Series C) of the University; and WHEREAS, a substantial portion of the funds necessary to complete the Project is expected to be derived from moneys not yet available, including appropriations from the Commonwealth of Virginia, fund-raising pledges and money from operations of the Hospital; WHEREAS, the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors, in order to help assure the availability of funds sufficient to complete the Project and to enhance the marketing of the Series C Bonds at reasonable interest rates, has determined that it is in the best interests of the University, its Medical School, and the University of Virginia Hospitals to pledge that portion of the University's current "quasiendowment" dedicated to Hospital and Medical School purposes (the "Pledged Endowment") for such purpose and to the extent hereinafter described; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia: Section 1. It is in the best interests of the University, its Medical School, and the University of Virginia Hospitals to pledge the Pledged Endowment as provided herein. Section 2. If at any time prior to completion of the Project the amount on deposit to the credit of the Construction Fund (as defined in the Master Resolution adopted by the Executive Committee on November 30, 1984), is not adequate to pay costs of the Project then due and the University has not theretofore provided the full amount of its scheduled equity contribution, the University will expend the income and, if necessary, the principal of the Pledged Endowment to remedy any shortfall in such scheduled equity contribution. Such obligation shall terminate upon the earlier of completion of the Project or the full funding of the University's scheduled equity contribution. Section 3. The University covenants that it will not reduce voluntarily the value of the Pledged Endowment to less than $20,000,000 prior to the termination date; provided, however, that the University shall not be obligated to remedy any reduction below $20,000,000 resulting from a decline in the market value of investments. Section 4. When the amount of the University's scheduled but unpaid equity contribution is reduced to $20,000,000, the pledge of the Pledged Endowment shall thereafter be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by each equity contribution thereafter deposited to the Construction Fund. Section 5. The pledge of Pledged Endowment shall not in any way secure the payment of principal of or interest on the Series C Bonds, and, prior to completion of the Project, the University may use the income earned on the Pledged Endowment not then needed to fund the equity contribution and any principal amount of the Pledged Endowment in excess of $20,000,000 for any purpose of the University. Section 6. This resolution shall take effect immediately upon its passage.

      <field name="fulltext">STATEMENT OF THE BOARD ON THE REPORT OF THE PROXY ADVISORY COMMITTEE The Board of Visitors is grateful to the Proxy Advisory Committee for its thorough review and analysis of the many facets of the divestment issue. In acknowledging its report we would like to express our sincere appreciation to Mr. Levenson and the Committee members and to recognize formally the untiring manner and dedication in which the Committee has undertaken its study of the question. We acknowledge receipt of petitions and other communications from various groups within the University community and have taken them into consideration in formulating this statement. As with most members of the University community the Board of Visitors is unanimous in its condemnation of apartheid. The Board has also been cognizant of the concerns within the University community regarding investment of endowment assets in companies doing business in South Africa. For more than four years the Finance Committee of the Board has been acting on proxy resolutions relating to business activities in South Africa based on the studied recommendations of the Proxy Advisory Committee. The Board has reviewed the report of the Proxy Advisory Committee to the President, heard Mr. Levenson's summary of that report and heard the President's description of the process that could be employed to implement the Committee's recommendations. As the Committee report so well explains, immediate and complete divestment would be neither practical nor responsible, and would impinge upon the Board's fiduciary responsibilities for the funds subject to its control. On the other hand, the Board does not wish to be perceived as supporting apartheid and, consequently adopts the Committee's recommended case-by-case approach. Today's holdings in companies which might be studied amount to less than 10% of the endowment portfolio. It is the intent of the Board for the University to retain its responsibility for the investment of its endowment assets. If the University has an investment in a company which is clearly shown to be acting in a manner which in the Board's judgment lends support to the apartheid system in South Africa, the Board will address the disposal of the investment. To adopt a policy of complete divestment would constitute an improper use of the University endowment fund for political purposes, an irresponsible action in this case, as it would be in others that may arise in the future. To this end the President is instructed to have the Proxy Advisory Committee, with the assistance of the University's Investment Office, assess carefully information provided to it in the normal course of its activities as well as other information brought to its attention, and after following the process suggested by the Committee and President today, file reports from time to time with the President containing findings, conclusions and recommendations. The Finance Committee will carefully consider such reports along with comments from the administration and make its recommendations to the full Board for action.</field>

The parties desire to amend said agreement as hereinafter set forth. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. The title to the agreement on page 1, is amended to read as follows: TRUST AGREEMENT FOR POOLED LIFE INCOME 2.

      <field name="fulltext">ATTACHMENT A UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE MATCHING GIFT PILOT PROGRAM THE ISSUE: The Campaign for the University of Virginia and present giving patterns reflect a preponderance of giving for specific (donor restricted) purposes. The long run excellence of the institution will best be served by an increase in the proportion of total giving applied to endowments which are unrestricted as to purpose. DISCUSSION: The tendency is for donors to restrict major gifts (both gifts to endowment and expendable gifts) to specific purposes and areas of the University. While such gifts are extremely valuable to the University's academic programs, the added flexibility of funds which are unrestricted as to purpose will serve the best interests and meet the highest priorities of the University now and in the future. PROPOSAL: A pilot program; October 1985-September 1986: Gifts of $100,000 or more for endowment which is unrestricted as to purpose in academic areas (schools, vice president for health affairs, vice president and provost) are eligible for matching on the basis of $0.50 for each $1 gift if they meet the following criteria: A. Only gifts received from individuals, corporations and foundations unrelated to the University qualify for matching; B. No more than $500,000 will be used for matching gifts during the pilot program; C. No one school may receive matching funds in excess of $100,000 during the pilot program; D. Only gifts received during the period of the pilot program for endowment which is unrestricted as to purpose will be eligible for matching. SOURCES OF FUNDS: Unrestricted private funds will be used to create the matching endowment fund. EVALUATION: At the conclusion of the pilot program, an evaluation will be conducted and a report made to the Board of Visitors pertaining to the appropriateness of continuing the program.

      <field name="fulltext">ATTACHMENT B May 19, 1983 UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CONSOLIDATED ENDOWMENT FUND INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES 1. The Consolidated Endowment will be divided into four parts: "equity", "fixed income", faculty mortgage loans, and other internally managed funds. 2. The "equity fund" is designed to provide long term capital appreciation. It should normally represent 75-80% of total endowment assets at market value. Although the actual percentage of equities and equity reserves will fluctuate with market conditions, levels in excess of 75% will be closely monitored by the Finance Committee and sales will automatically be implemented when the ratio exceeds 85%. The Finance Committee of the Board of Visitors may change any of these ratios at its discretion, but it is anticipated that such changes will be Infrequent. 3. The investment objective of the "equity fund" is to earn a real total return (adjusted by the Consumer Price Index) equal to the University's spending from endowment. In addition, "equity fund" portfolios should out-perform the S&amp;P 500 stock average net of fees and the A.G. Becker and Cambridge Associates common stock manager means. These objectives are to be measured over running five year periods. It is recognized that the real return objective may be difficult to attain in every five year period, but should be attainable over most five year periods. 4. "Equity fund" managers would normally invest in common stocks. However, such managers may at their discretion hold investment reserves of either money market instruments or bonds without limitation in terms of asset size or period of time with the understanding that performance will be measured against the common stock indices listed above. 5. "Equity fund" assets may also be allocated by the Finance Committee to separately managed portfolios of foreign securities excluding ADR's (up to 10% of market value), real estate equities (up to 10% of market value), and venture capital (up to 2% of market value). These ratios are also subject to review by the Finance Committee, but changes are expected to be infrequent. 6. The purpose of the fixed income portion of Consolidated Endowment is to provide a hedge against deflation and to increase current return relative to an all equity fund. The "fixed fund" should represent 15% or more of total assets. Should mortgage commitments decline below 10% for a significant period of time, the "fixed fund" will be increased by a corresponding percent. 7. Money market instruments as well as bonds may be used without limitation in the "fixed fund", but equities and convertible bonds are excluded. The "fixed fund" manager is expected to employ so-called active manager techniques such as interest rate anticipation and inter-sectoral arbitrage, but changes in average maturity should usually be moderate and incremental. Since the fund is designed as a deflation hedge, an average maturity of five years would be the minimum. In addition, current coupons and call protection should be emphasized to assure a high and stable level of income. 8. The investment objective of the "fixed fund" is to outperform the Lehman Brothers/Kuhn Loeb Bond Index net of fees over running five year periods. 9. With respect to both common stock and bond managers within the "equity" and "fixed" funds, individual security selection, security size and quality, number of portfolio industries or holdings, current income levels, and turnover are left to broad manager discretion, subject to usual standards of fiduciary prudence. An exception is that private placements of any kind, including direct mortgages, may not be purchased. In addition, the use of options and financial futures require Finance Committee approval. Manager policies in these and related areas are attached as Appendix A. 10. New endowment gifts shall be allocated to individual managers by the Finance Committee after first receiving the advice of the Vice President for Business and Finance. As a general rule, new cash will be used to rebalance the total fund in the direction of a 75-80% permanent equity ratio. Within the "equity fund", new cash will be used to rebalance the portfolio assets of the managers in the direction of maintaining ratios between "core" and "specialty" managers as established by the Finance Committee. These are only general rules, however, and may be disregarded or modified at any time by the Finance Committee with advice from the Vice President for Business and Finance. 11. The University's faculty mortgage program is designed to assist new faculty in the purchase of homes. The program also serves to dampen the volatility of the portfolio since positions are carried at book value, and to increase current return relative to an all equity fund. 12. The mortgage program has been capped by the Board of Visitors at $32 million. Should mortgage loans fall below 10% of the total portfolio, the "fixed fund" will be increased by a corresponding percentage. 13. The investment impact of the mortgage portfolio is moderated by the impact of the bond issue of 1972 that will be outstanding through February 1, 1997. This liability shall be netted when calculating the percent represented by mortgages in the total portfolio but not considered in relation to the $32 million cap. 14. Both the total fund and the individually managed portfolios will be monitored on a continual basis for consistency in each manager's investment philosophy, return relative to objectives, and investment risk as measured by asset concentrations, exposure to extreme economic conditions, and market volatility. Portfolios will be reviewed by the Finance Committee on a quarterly basis, but results will be evaluated on a running five year cycle.</field>
