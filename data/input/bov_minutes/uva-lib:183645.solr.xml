      <field name="fulltext">UNIVERSITY SESQUICENTENNIAL, 1969 The President reminded the Board that the 150th anniversary of the founding of the University of Virginia would occur on 25 January 1969.

      <field name="fulltext">THE ELIS AND SIGNE OLSSON PROFESSORSHIP IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION The President reported that Mrs. Signe M. Olsson has created a trust fund which will enable the University to establish the Elis and Signe Olsson Professorship in Business Administration to be dedicated to the development of high concepts of integrity and ethical conduct in public life. The income from the trust fund is to be received by the University for twenty years, but the donor has asked that an amount be deducted from the income each year in order that, at the end of twenty years, the capital fund will be sufficient to continue the Professorship. The donor has in mind the enormous importance of integrity in human affairs and seeks through this gift to stimulate general public interest in and understanding of the ethical implications that necessarily adhere to the exercise of authority in both private and public life. The occupant of the Elis and Signe Olsson Professorship, therefore, through teaching, research, and publication, will endeavor to enhance public awareness that actions of men in responsible positions in public and private life are influenced in differing degrees by a belief in right and wrong, by the dictates of individual conscience, and by the anticipated moral and social consequences of their actions. The intention of the donor is that the activities generated by the Elis and Signe Olsson Professorship shall aim at attaining a position of leadership, in the academic world and elsewhere, in efforts to improve standards of behavior in both public and private business. In particular, therefore, the Professorship in its activities will emphasize the essentiality of integrity in the reconciliation of those concepts commonly indicated as the dignity of the individual, the imperatives of organizations, and the moralities implicit in free markets. The following resolution was therefore adopted: RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Elis and Signe Olsson Professorship in Business Administration be and it is hereby established in the Graduate School of Business Administration; BE IT RESOLVED further that this Professorship shall be dedicated to high concepts of integrity and ethical conduct in public and private life; and BE IT RESOLVED further, whereas it is the wish of the donors of the funds supporting the Elis and Signe Olsson Professorship in Business Administration during the twenty-year period from 1966 to 1986 when the income of the trust heretofore established by Mrs. Signe Maria Olsson is being paid to the University of Virginia for the support of the Olsson Professorship, that annually a sufficient portion of the income shall be set aside and retained by the University of Virginia in order that by 1986 a capital fund will have been created in an amount, the income of which will be sufficient to maintain the Olsson Professorship after the trust established by Mrs. Olsson ceases to support that Professorship in 1986. The following resolution was also adopted: WHEREAS the members of the Board have learned with special pleasure of the generous gift of Mrs. Olsson for the establishment of the Elis and Signe Olsson Professorship in Business Administration; and WHEREAS the generosity of the donor in this instance is especially gratifying as a mark of the continuing relationship between the Olsson family and the University of Virginia; NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we hereby record our deep gratitude for this gift and direct the Secretary to transmit a copy of this resolution to the donor as a mark of our warm appreciation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GIFT OF WALTER REED PAPERS The following resolution was adopted: WHEREAS Mrs. Mary Kahler Hench, widow of the late Dr. Philip S.

      <field name="fulltext">INDEPENDENT AUDIT The Chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. Hobbs, reported on the studies his Committee had made concerning the possibility of an independent audit of the University's accounts in accordance with the instructions given to the Committee by the Board of Visitors at its meeting on 3 June 1966. He stated that consultations with the State Auditor of Public Accounts and the Attorney General had resulted in the State Auditor's changing his auditing schedule of the University of Virginia from every other year to every year. He noted that the staff of auditors was already on the Grounds making an audit of the fiscal year ending on 30 June 1966. In view of the close cooperation provided to the Committee by the State Auditor of Public Accounts, Mr. Hobbs stated that the Committee had decided to defer any request for an independent audit by a private firm in order that the results of the new auditing program might be assessed. The Committee, Mr. Hobbs concluded, will review the situation from time to time. Mr. Hobbs also stated that he and his Committee were looking into the matter of the sufficiency of the surety bonds carried by University financial officials, and reported that he had consulted some private insurance firms in this regard. A further report on this matter will be made at the next meeting. The Finance Committee, Mr. Hobbs reported, had also looked into the matter of the University endowment funds and had prepared a preliminary report to be distributed shortly after this meeting to all members of the Board other than those who are members of the Finance Committee. A more complete report will be made to the full Board at the December meeting. Finally, Mr. Hobbs reported on the study by his Committee of the land purchase program of the University of Virginia since 1956. He reported that almost three million dollars in local funds had been used for such purposes. A copy of the report on land purchases from local funds will be sent to each member of the Board.</field>
