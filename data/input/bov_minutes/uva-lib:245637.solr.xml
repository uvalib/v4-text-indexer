Resolved that the sum of $1000 per annum be set apart as a sinking fund for the reduction of the Debt contracted by a loan from Mrs. Randolph; which sum shall be annually invested by the Bursar out of the Revenues, in stock of this state; and that the amount so invested be annually by him especially reported to the Board. The committee of Finance made a report accompanied by the following resolutions which were adopted. 3. Resolved that the price of Board &amp;c at the Hotels be fixed at $110 for the session of nine months, in lieu of the sum now fixed by the Enactments. 4.

Resolved that the enactment prescribing a uniform to be worn by the Students be suspended for one year from this date; &amp; that so much of the enactments as prescribes the hour of rising in the morning be so modified as to require that the Students (under the penalty now prescribed for late rising) be ready for breakfast at their respective Hotels- and that the Janitor call upon the Hotelkeepers daily for a list of the names of absentees from Breakfast, and report the same weekly to the Chairman. 8. Resolved that the Candidates for the degree of Master of Arts, shall hereafter be required to pass a satisfactory general examination at the close of their entire course of study on all the subjects embraced in the degree;- and that each candidate shall, moreover, satisfy the Faculty of his general literary acquirements by furnishing an appropriate essay on some subject of Literature or Science- and it shall be the duty of the Faculty to select one or more of such essays to be read by the author or authors on the public day. About 12 M. Mr. Rives withdrew from the Board. 9. Resolved that, hereafter the subject of Logic shall be comprehended in the Examination of candidates for graduation in the school of Moral Philosophy. 10. Resolved, that the four large cases now standing in the Lecture room lately used by the School of Natural Philosophy, be removed to the Museum. 11, Resolved that one hundred dollars be appropriated for the purchase of Chemical apparatus &amp; agents in addition to the customary annual appropriation made to that department. 12. Resolved that the same reasons which induced the Board of Visitors to declare in their resolution of the 19th August 1837. "That it is inexpedient to allow the claims of professors for repairs or alterations upon their tenements made without authority from the Board", apply with equal force to all other persons occupying the other buildings or tenements of the University. 13. Resolved that the Executive Committee be requested to have the lots facing the Hotels divided according to the original design of the Board, and the Proctor remove any fences now upon them in conformity with that design. 14. The Board notice an unseemly shed erected on the alley leading to Pavilion No.3, which they request the Professor occupying that pavilion to have removed.</field>
