Present William J. Robertson, Thos. J. Randolph and John B. Baldwin." "There having been no quorum of the Visitors present at the time appointed for the annual meeting it becomes necessary for the Executive Committee to act upon some matters not admitting of delay. The erection of the new Dining Hall in connection with the Hotel at present occupied by the Proctor as a residence renders it necessary to furnish the Proctor another house. He is therefore authorized to take possession of the house recently occupied by Mrs McCoy as a Hotel. The changes made in the Hotel occupied by Col Ward rendering it unsuitable as a Hotel Col Ward is transfered to the Hotel lately occupied by Mr Brock. The Proctor is requested to report to the Visitors at their meeting in September a plan for assigning the dormitories to the three Hotels, giving to the new Hotel the number formerly given to Mr Brock &amp; Mrs McCoy together. The committee having learned that the basement of the Pavilion occupied by Dr McGuffy and that of the house occupied by the Proctor are in a condition requiring more immediate attention than any others in the University. Resolved that Mr Pratt be requested to give his earliest attention to them. Resolved that the Proctor be requested to advertize for applicants for the new Hotel the applications to be filed before the meeting on the first of September. That he give notice that the rent of the Hotel will be $300 that the rooms formerly given to two Hotels will be given to this one, that the Keeper of the new Hotel will not be required to furnish the dormitories of the students boarding with him but that there will be a deduction of $10 from the board of all his boarders who furnish their own rooms and $2.50 for washing their bedding and towels. That the Board will be paid quarterly in advance the Hotel Keeper giving bond and security in a sum sufficient to cover such advances and for the discharge of his duties- And that the servants of the Hotel will be required to attend upon the dormitories." Resolved that the Keeper of the New Hotel now to be appointed and his successors in office be required to give bond in the penalty of $10,000 instead of $5000 as required by the resolutions of June 27th 1857. Resolved that the Keeper of the New Hotel be not required to supply furniture to the dormitories occupied by students boarding with him or to wash the bedding or towels of such students but shall furnish attendance upon the rooms and students as heretofore. Resolved that each student boarding at the new hotel be required to provide the furniture of his own room and the washing of his bedding and towels, and that for such furniture and washing he be allowed as an abatement of $12.50 per session from his board. Ordered that George W. Spooner be paid his bill amounting to $160 for putting up cases for apparatus &amp;c in the lecture room of Prof. F. H. Smith. Resolved that the Hotel Keepers of the last session who claim indemnity for loss of boarders be requested to furnish a list of the boarders upon whom the loss was sustained - with such explanation as to each as they may deem proper to show the time and cause of their leaving. On motion Dr Maupin was appointed chairman for the next session. The Board then adjourned until tomorrow morning at nine oclock. Friday Septr 3rd 1858 The Board met again this morning at 9 oclock present the same gentlemen as on yesterday. Resolved that Professor Davis and Cabell be authorized to employ Mr Scharff for the next session as heretofore. The Committee on Finance &amp;c submitted the following report. The Committee to whom were referred the reports of the Proctor, Bursar, and Commissioner beg leave to report that they have given a careful examination to the said reports and find them in all respects correct and satisfactory. Sep 3, 1858 John B. Baldwin Wm T. Joynes Resolved that the Executive Committee be authorized and requested to sell the "Dawson Farm" upon such terms as they may deem best. Resolved that a meeting of the Board be held on the 29th day of this month for the special purpose of fixing regulations for the management of the Infirmary. Resolved that Messrs Garnett &amp; Baldwin be appointed a Committee to revise and codify the Enactments with instructions to report to the meeting of the Board to be held on the 29th inst. Resolved that the Executive Committee be instructed to execute Mr Ellets plan for supplying the University with water with as little delay as practicable and that in the execution of the work the Committee if practicable obtain the advice and general direction of Mr Ellet. Resolved that hereafter the Hotel Keeper shall be appointed in the first instance for one year only. The Board then proceeded to the election of a Hotel Keeper for the New Hotel for the next year when Dr W.W. Hamner was appointed. Resolved that the Executive Committee be instructed to submit the various plans for warming and ventilating the public rooms of the University to Mr Ellet or to Capt Meigs U.S.A. for their advice and if necessary to procure one of them to visit the precincts and prepare a plan. Resolved that the Executive Committee be instructed to cause the Kitchen and cooking arrangements at the Hotel assigned to Mr. Ward to be improved in such manner and to such extent as they think necessary and proper. On consideration of the memorial of the Columbian Society it is ordered that the Proctor be authorized to cause two of the rooms in the Hotel on the Eastern range lately occupied by Mr Ward to be thrown into one in the case the Society desire it, and that the Board decline to pay the rent of a Hall for the said society for the last year. A communication having been presented from Prof Gildersleeve requesting to be allowed the use of an additional dormitory it was Resolved that inasmuch as Professor Gildersleeve is already allowed the use of a dormitory as his office, and inasmuch as there is such a scarcity of rooms in the University that an additional dormitory cannot be conveniently allowed to Prof Gildersleeve, the Board decline to grant the request. Resolved that the sum of $300 be appropriated for the purchase of chemicals &amp;c in the department of practical Chemistry, to be expended upon the order of the Professor of Chemistry. The application on behalf of T. Henry Johnston, having been read and considered by the Board; the Board of Visitors in view of the gravity of the offence against the discipline and laws of the University, and of the necessity of rigidly enforcing the same for the prevention of the practice of duelling among the students have. Resolved that the application be rejected. Resolved unanimously that Prof Holmes be reappointed Professor of History and General Literature. Col Baldwin offered the following resolution which was seconded by Mr Robertson. A letter from Prof Harrison was laid before the Board stating his conviction that the interests of the School of Latin and the progress of the members of the school in scholarship require the appointment of an Assistant Instructor in that School whereupon it was resolved. 1. That the arrangement made on the 27th day of June 1856 whereby the professor of Latin was allowed all the fees from the students attending his classes was based upon the understanding and expectation that the professor should without assistance perform all the labor of instruction in that school and that in the opinion of the Visitors if the professor has found himself unable to fulfil this expectation - it is proper that any assistance required by him shall be paid for out of the fees allowed for the performance of the whole service. 2. That the Professor of Latin be authorized to appoint an assistant Instructor in the usual manner and at the usual salary - to be paid out of the fees which would otherwise go to the said Professor. Whereupon Mr Tucker offered the following resolution as a substitute. The application of Dr Harrison being read and considered the Board "Resolved, that until, and unless some general arrangement shall be digested and agreed upon by the Board, in regard to such an enlargement of the educational force, as is suggested by Dr. Harrison for the School of Latin - the Board deem it inexpedient and decline to grant the request of Dr Harrison." When Mr Joynes offered the following as an substitute for Mr Tuckers substitute "Professor Harrison having applied to the Board to allow him an assistant in the school of Latin it was "Resolved that insomuch as the allowance of an assistant at the expense of the University as proposed, may involve the necessity of modifying the existing arrangement of the School of Latin, and of the fees and emoluments of Prof Harrison, and the Board not being disposed in the absence of many of its members to enter upon that subject, the Board decline to take any further action at present upon the application of Prof Harrison ." The vote being taken on Mr Joynes substitute resulted in the affirmative. The ayes and Noes being demanded were as follows Ayes, Messrs Robertson, Joynes, Garnett, Baldwin, Tucker, and Randolph. Noes, None. The vote being then taken on Mr Joynes substitute in place of Mr Baldwins resolution resulted in favor of Mr Joynes substitute. The ayes and noes being demanded resulted as follows. Ayes Messrs Randolph Garnett Tucker &amp; Joynes. Noes Messrs Baldwin &amp; Robertson. The question then coming up upon Mr Baldwins resolution as amended by Mr Joynes substitute it was adopted. The Ayes and Noes being demanded resulted as follows. Ayes Messrs Joynes Robertson Baldwin &amp; Randolph Noes Messrs Tucker &amp; Garnett Resolved that as there is no other room, at the disposal of the Board for the use of their Secretary and the preservation of their records they are unable to give Mr Massie the apartment he asks for. A communication from Mr A. Maupin in reply to the resolution of the Board adopted on yesterday having been read, it was Resolved that no farther action on the subject is necessary. Resolved that the Proctor be authorized to accept the proposition of Messrs Hutchenson and Wickersham of New York to send upon consignment and deliver at the University fifty sets of Bed-room furniture upon the terms set forth in their letter of August 18th 1858, viz $27.50 for each set and the actual cost and charges of transportation to the University, and that the Proctor be authorized to sell such furniture to students of the University at its actual cost and to remit the price to Messrs Hutchinson and Wickersham without abatement. And the University will be responsible for the faithful performance of the agency thus assumed. The Proctors amended report upon the assignment of dormitories among the three Hotels dated Sept 2nd 1858 giving to Mrs Ross 48 students to Col Ward 48 students, and to Dr Hamner 95 students was approved by the Board. The Board then adjourned until tomorrow morning at nine oclock. Saturday Sept 4th 1858 The Board met pursuant to adjournment present the same gentlemen as on yesterday, when the following proceedings were had. Mr. J. E. D'Alfonce having applied for permission to erect at his own expense upon the lands of the University vapor baths for the use of persons connected with the University it was resolved. 1. That the Executive Committee be authorized to contract with Mr D'Alfonce for the putting up of said baths-securing to the University the following points. 1. That the permission is a personal privelege and that no transfer of it shall be made except to a party approved by the Board of Visitors. 2. That the Visitors shall have the absolute right at their discretion and at any time to require the removal of the buildings or to purchase them for the use of the University - at valuation. 3. That the use of the baths shall be confined to persons connected with the University. 4. That at the end of twenty years the entire establishment shall belong to the University. Resolved 2nd That the Executive Committee be authorized to contract for such other provisions as in their judgment may be proper to secure to the Visitors the control and police of the baths. On motion it was resolved that Each Professor shall in addition to the weekly reports now required by the enactments, preserve a synopsis in a condensed form, of the instruction actually given in each lecture of his course, to be submitted to the inspection of the Board of Visitors at their regular annual meeting. Mr. Garnett submitted the following resolutions which were adopted. 1. There shall be three Assistant Instructors in the School of Modern Languages, one for the French, one for the German, and one for the Spanish and Italian Languages, whose mother tongues are French German and Spanish respectively, except that if such a person, properly qualified, cannot be found for the Instructor of Spanish and Italian, an Italian may be appointed to that place. 2. Their mode of appointment, compensation, duties and relations to the Professor shall be the same as those of other Assistant Instructors. The Professor shall exercise a constant supervision over all the classes, and be responsible for the entire instruction. 3. It shall be a primary object of this school to teach the students not only to write, but to speak and converse easily in the living languages taught, and to this end the classes shall be thoroughly drilled in sections, or in such other manner as the Professor may direct. 4. Modern History and Modern Geography are not required to be taught in this School, but the Professor shall lecture on the Literature of each language and especially on the History of the language itself. He shall teach the general principles of the formation and growth of languages, and of comparative Grammar and Philology illustrating, especially from the Modern Languages the laws which determine the origin of new words, and of new gramatical forms when races speaking different tongues intermix. 5. In the Anglo-Saxon class, the Professor shall teach in addition to that language the History and laws of the English language, giving full time and prominence to this important subject. 6. From and after the commencement of the session of 1859-60 no one shall be allowed to graduate in the French, German, Spanish or Italian languages who has not given satisfactory evidence of ability not only to write but to speak and converse easily and correctly in the language in which he offers for graduation. But any one who may have graduated in any of these languages prior to the commencement of the session of 1859-60, and who may thereafter apply for the degree of A. M. shall not be required in his review examination, to exhibit any greater proficiency in such language, than was required for the diploma when he graduated. Resolved that there be allowed and paid to the Hotel Keepers of the last session the following sums viz to Col Ward $460, to Mrs McCoy $220, to Mr Brock $300, to Mrs. Ross, $200, in full of all claims and demands against the University in any wise growing out of the action of the visitors or the Faculty in relation to the fever and the suspension of lectures. These sums have been ascertained from the best information accessible to the Visitors, and the allowances must be received in full discharge of all demands.
