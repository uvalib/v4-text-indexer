Jackson, of the Virginia Trust Company, of the clause in the will of your son, Peter P. Homes, leaving $1,000 to the University of Virginia to be used as a scholarship in the Law School. Personally, I want to assure you of the great pride and happiness I have in this action of your find boy whom we all remember here with pleasure and approval. It is an exhibition of the finest spirit, and will, I am sure, stimulate and hearten all of our alumni who remember with effection their Alma Mater. I shall want to call the scholarship the Homes Scholarship, and it will be permanent in our academic life. The Rector and Visitors direct me to express to you their warm appreciation of this action of your son and their determination to carry out his wishes and to hold in grateful memory his fine deed. Faithfully yours, Edwin A. Alderman, President. The President stated that Mr. Paul G.

The President presented the following letter from the President of the General Athletic Association with respect to the employment of a permanent athletic coach: University, Va. January 7, 1920. Dr. E. A. Alderman, President, University of Virginia. My dear Dr. Alderman: At a recent meeting of the Executive Committee of the General Athletic Association concerning the employment of a permanent athletic coach, the following motion was unanimously passed: "The General Athletic Association of the University of Virginia agrees to pay half the salary of a permanent athletic coach, provided the University of Virginia pays the other half. This salary shall not exceed the maximum salary of a full professor of the University. And if this plan is adopted, the General Athletic Association will pay one half the salary of the Associate Director of Athletics, provided the University pays the other half. It is to be understood that these officers shall be full-time men." The Executive Committee of the General Athletic Association presents to you this record of its action, in order that you may take whatever action you may see fit thereon. Very truly yours, J. N. Greear, Jr., Pres. General Athletic Association. The foregoing matter was disposed of in the following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted: RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors appropriate the sum of $2,250 toward the annual salary of a Professor of Physical Training, it being understood that a similar sum be provided by the General Athletic Association for the annual salary of this University officer. RESOLVED, further, That the sum of $950 be appropriated for the annual salary of an Associate Director of Athletics, it being understood that a similar sum be provided by the General Athletic Association for the annual salary of this University officer. And it is understood that both of these officers shall render full-time service to the institution. RESOLVED, That a committee, consisting of the President, Mr. Michie and Mr. Robertson, be given power to act in this matter in view of the present urgency. Upon the recommendation of the President the following resolutions were adopted: WHEREAS, The Virginia Education Commission in its recent report to the legislature makes the following recommendation: "For the benefit, primarily of teachers, the Commission recommends that the University and other State Institutions of higher learning be placed on a twelve months' basis, offering a summer quarter for men and women of equal grade with any other quarter. This quarter should be divided into two terms of six weeks each, at least one of which terms should be designed to meet the needs of the public school teachers, but both terms should be open to teachers who are in a position to take advantage of the larger opportunity presented," and express the belief that from an economic point of view great physical as well as instructional waste results from the practice of closing certain state institutions during the summer, and such summer quarter offers an unusual opportunity for meeting the imperative need for a larger number of prepared teachers, and WHEREAS, There is an increasing demand on the part of college students for opportunity to reduce the number of years required to secure their academic and professional degrees, through summer work, such demand finding expression in the increasing number of students each year in the summer session working for college credit, and WHEREAS, The summer session of 1919 was conducted for two terms with most gratifying results, although for lack of funds, announcement of courses could be made a few days in advance of the opening of the second term, and WHEREAS, The University desires to serve the State in the fullest measure possible, and, on account of already being on a three-term basis, can very readily adopt a summer quarter without interference with its present organization, therefore, be it RESOLVED, first, That the Rector and Visitors of the University authorize the President and Director of the Summer School to conduct a regular summer quarter of two sessions of six weeks each, provided sufficient funds can be secured for this purpose; Second, That the legislature be asked for an additional appropriation of $10,000 annually for the maintenance of such summer quarter. WHEREAS, The University has conducted a summer session since 1905, the primary purpose of which has been, as announced in its catalogue, "to train teachers for high schools, academies and colleges," and WHEREAS, both men and women have been admitted to the summer courses on equal terms., and the work of the men, when satisfactorily completed, has been credited toward the degrees conferred by the University, but the women completing the same courses have not been given degree credit in this University, and WHEREAS, The standards of the Southern Commission on Accredited Schools and all similar agencies require that at least three-fourths of the teachers in accredited high schools shall hold standard college degrees, and this rule is observed by the best high schools in the country, and WHEREAS, More than two-thirds of the teachers in our public high schools are women who must secure a baccalaureate degree or its equivalent in order to meet the requirements of the best standardizing agencies and be eligible for positions in our best high schools, and WHEREAS, The State of Virginia appropriated $13,000 annually toward the maintenance of the summer session for the express purpose of providing qualified teachers for the schools of the State, and WHEREAS, Several hundred of the best Virginia high school teachers go annually to the summer schools of Columbia, Chicago, Harvard, Johns Hopkins and other universities largely because they can secure degrees at these universities for their summer work, and many teachers from other Southern States prefer to come to this university but go elsewhere for the same reason, and WHEREAS, other colleges and universities all over this country accept the summer school work of the University of Virginia for degree credit, although it is not now accepted by the University itself, and WHEREAS, the Virginia Education Commission in its recent report to the legislature recommends "For the benefit, primarily of teachers, the University and other State institutions of higher learning be placed on a twelve months' basis, offering a summer quarter for men and women of equal grade with any other quarter. Degree credit shall be allowed for work of appropriate grade done in the summer quarter and for the completion of prescribed courses, degrees shall be conferred." Therefore, be it RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University, That authority is hereby given to the President and Faculty of the University in their discretion to donfer degrees upon women students of the summer session, who meet the entrance requirements of the University and complete satisfactorily the requirements for such degrees. The President presented to the Board a plan adopted by certain members of the General Alumni Association for raising a three million dollar endowment fund and the administration of same by the Association. As the plan proposed contained several matters requiring the most careful thought before action could be had by the Board, it was deemed expedient to refer the same to a committee to confer with the General Alumni Association. The Rector, Mr. Michie, and the President were named on said committee. Upon the recommendation of the President, Dr. Walter A. Klotz, medical director of the Blue Bidge Sanatorium, was elected as associate professor of Phthisio-therapy in the medical faculty of the University. The application of the Commerce Bank and Trust Company to be designated as one of the depositories of the University was referred to Messrs. Walker and Bryan with power to act. The Board then adjourned to meet January 27th, at 8 P.M. [signed] R. Tate Irvine Rector. [signed] E. I. Carruthers Secretary.</field>
