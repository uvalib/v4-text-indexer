      <field name="fulltext">MODIFICATION OF PROCEDURE FOR THE ASSIGNMENT OF PAVILIONS Occupancy of Pavilions on the Lawn of the University of Virginia has evolved through the University's history in accordance with Thomas Jefferson's original design. When the size of the faculty exceeded the capacity of the Lawn and the Pavilions, selective policies became essential. Those policies were last revised and approved by the Board of Visitors in May, 1983. Priority in Pavilion occupancy is under those policies assigned to eligible academic officers in an order which reflects the seniority of their respective offices. Priority is given to the Vice President and Provost, the Vice President for Health Affairs, and then to the Deans in the order of the creation of the various schools. Priority then flows to full professors in order of seniority. The policy also excludes part-time faculty, faculty within eight years of retirement, and those without spouses. No terminal limit has ever been placed on Pavilion occupancy, other than that of retirement from the faculty. The elimination by the General Assembly in 1987 of any mandatory retirement age compels re-examination of the traditional policies since faculty members may now elect to remain in service well beyond the normal retirement age. Any attempt to terminate Pavilion occupancy at that (or any other) age regardless of the occupant's faculty status, would almost certainly be deemed unlawful age discrimination. To maintain both the traditional principles of Pavilion occupancy and to ensure equitable access to Lawn residency for younger faculty and Deans, the following changes are to be made in the applicable policies (only for the Pavilions and not to other University-owned housing facilities such as Carr's Hill, Montebello, Morea, etc., to which separate policies apply in each case). The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED that the Buildings and Grounds Committee of the Board of Visitors, in its assignment of Pavilions on the Lawn shall be governed by the following policies, effective February 1, 1988, supplementing the policies adopted by the Board, effective June 3, 1983: (1) Reference to any mandatory retirement age shall be removed from the policy; (2) Priority shall continue to be accorded to the two academic Vice Presidents and the Deans in the order of founding of the several schools, and then to the faculty in order of seniority. (3) Persons who occupy Pavilions by reason of an administrative appointment as Dean or Vice President may remain in the Pavilion for not more than two years following the conclusion of the term of the administrative appointment. Faculty members who occupy Pavilions by reason of seniority shall do so for a term of five years, renewable at the University's and the resident's option for an additional five years, but in no case to exceed a total of ten years. (4) For those persons who already occupy Pavilions on February 1, 1988, individual arrangements shall be negotiated by the Office of the Vice President for Business and Finance, reflecting the general intent of the revisions described here.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ATTACHMENT A = Excerpt from Minutes of Design Committee Meeting Jeffersonian Restoration Advisory Board MINUTES OF DESIGN COMMITTEE MEETING October 21, 1987 2. Having approved at its last meeting the encapsulation and replication of Jeffersonian era metal plates, the Committee continued its deliberations regarding the roof of Pavilion X, to decide about the color of the metal and whether or not to reconstruct the large parapet that comprised an open-topped attic zone (n.b., not enclosed attic space). Messrs. Mesick and Waite presented the archaeological findings in regard to both subjects, advising that the parapet be rebuilt. Since paint analysis indicated that a rich gray paint color had probably been used originally, the Committee voted unanimously to recommend painting the new metal plates accordingly. Following prolonged discussion of the extensive evidence about how the Pavilion X parapet was designed and constructed, the Committee agreed with the proposal to rebuild it. It was clearly stated that this recommendation to reconstruct can only apply to Pavilion X; at any of the other Pavilions thought to have had rooftop parapets or balustrades, an identical search of records and building fabric must be carried out before deciding whether or not to reconstruct. Such a posture is in accordance with our emphasis on the necessity of complete research as the basis for design decisions. The Committee also agreed that the design of the new parapet must be integrated with the reestablishment of the metal roofing and must not allow water and debris to collect behind the parapet. The Committee voted unanimously to recommend to the full Board and, in turn, to the Board of Visitors, that Jefferson's early parapet be reestablished in a failsafe manner atop a metal roof painted gray. The Committee also stressed the need to properly fund the design and construction of this special parapet work, which goes beyond the simple need to replace a failing roof.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ATTACHMENT B= Housekeeping Services Contract Approval for Housekeeping Services Contract Potentially Exceeding $500,000 The Building Services Division of Physical Plant will require approval from the Board of Visitors to exceed the $500,000 total price on the housekeeping services contract during calendar year 1988 and in future years if the University exercises its option to add additional buildings to the list of those under contract. The total cost of the housekeeping contract to become effective January 1, 1988 is $498,315 for 18 buildings. The contract permits the University to add up to four additional buildings to the contract as future needs might dictate. At present, it seems likely that it would be desirable to include two additional buildings early in 1988 as renovations on them are completed. The cost of all four additional buildings would cause the contract to be $543,465 per year. We are requesting the Board of Visitor's approval for an annual contract amount up to $543,465.
