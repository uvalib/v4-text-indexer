WILLIAM JAMES RUCKER GIFT OF $50,000 TO ESTABLISH A HOME FOR CRIPPLED CHILDREN AS AN ADJUNCT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ORTHOPEDICS OF THE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL: Mr. Perkins appeared before the Board and read the following letter addressed to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia by Mr. William J. Rucker, of Charlottesville. May 23, 1941 The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia University, Virginia Gentlemen: I have recently become interested in the establishment of a home for Crippled Children to be owned and operated by the University of Virginia as an adjunct to the Department of Orthopedics of the University Hospital. I am advised that a property consisting of some nine or more acres of land with large stone residence and several outbuildings thereon and situated on the Ivy Road about one mile west of the University may be purchased at a reasonable price, and when certain structual changes and improvements are made in the buildings it will be adapted to this purpose. I, therefore, desire to give you the sum of Fifty Thousand dollars to be used by you in the purchase of this property, in making such changes, improvements and additions to the buildings, and improvements to the grounds, as you may see fit, and for equipping and maintaining this property as a home for Crippled Children so long as the necessity therefor may exist. If, at any time in the future changed conditions should, in your sound judgment, render the continued operation of the home inadvisable, you are authorized to discontinue such operation and, either use the property for other purposes in connection with the University Hospital, or to sell and convey it applying the proceeds to such other uses of the Hospital as you may think best. It will be a source of gratification to me if you should see fit to designate the institution and have it known as "The William James Rucker Home for Convalescent Children", but I do not make this a condition to my gift. This letter will be presented to you by my friend, Mr. W. Allan Perkins, and I will appreciate your advising him of your desires in the matter as soon as may be convenient. Sincerely yours, (Signed) William J. Rucker The President then made a statement outlining the need for such an institution as Mr. Rucker's gift will make possible, and upon motion made by Mr. Stettinius, and seconded by Miss Randolph, it was unanimously, RESOLVED that Mr. Rucker's generous gift is gratefully accepted by this Board and the Rector is hereby requested to prepare a suitable acknowledgment expressing to Mr. Rucker this Board's appreciation of the great public service which he is rendering to the Hospital of the University of Virginia and to the many children whom our Medical Staff is striving to bring back to strength and usefulness; and that the institution shall be designated and known as "The William James Rucker Home for Convalescent Children". Mr. Perkins then presented to the Board a written offer executed by My Own Development Corporation by which said Corporation offers to sell to the University a tract of some eleven acres of land situated on State Highway No. 250, just west of the University grounds, at the price of $22,000.00 cash. Discussion of this offer developed the following facts - 1st. That the property offered is well located for the purposes under consideration, and is the property referred to in Mr. Rucker's letter. 2nd. That in the opinion of those members of the Board who are familiar with the property the price of $22,000.00 is reasonable. 3rd. That possession of this property may be had at once and the necessary changes, repairs, and improvements to the grounds and buildings may be proceeded with without delay. This Board is therefore of opinion that said offer should be accepted but in order that some further study of all surrounding conditions and facts may be made and all details of said property's physical characteristics, and the status of its title be inquired into, it is- RESOLVED, - (1) That the Rector be and is hereby requested to appoint a special committee to make such study and inquiry, and that this Committee, with the advice of the Attorney for the University as to the sufficiency of the title to said property, be and is hereby given full power to accept said offer and do all things needful to close the purchase of said property, paying the purchase price therefor from the funds given by Mr. Rucker, and receiving a deed conveying said property to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. (2) That said committee shall also be charged with the duty of determining whether any other property in the immediate neighborhood should be acquired by the University, said committee being fully empowered to acquire such additional property if in their opinion it is advisable so to do. (3) That the President be and is hereby authorized to appoint such Committee or Committees as he may consider necessary to plan and execute such changes, improvements, and additions to the buildings and improvements to the grounds and equipment of buildings and other facilities as to such Committees may seem necessary, but with the express limitation that no more than $13,000.00 from the sum given by Mr. Rucker shall be expended on these accounts. NATIONAL DEFENSE RESEARCH COMMITTEE CONTRACTS: The President presented three proposed contracts of the National Defense Research Committee and the University covering research projects in the Department of Chemistry, and requested authority for the Rector to execute same on behalf of the University whereupon the following was adopted: RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that the Rector be and he is hereby authorized to execute the three contracts between the University of Virginia and the National Defense Research Committee covering research for the said Committee in the Department of Chemistry of the University of Virginia. FINANCIAL BUDGET 1941-42: The President presented his budget estimates for the fiscal year of 1941-42, showing estimated receipts of $2,853,199, and disbursements of $2,845, 347, and stated that the budget was a tentative working basis until a revised budget could be presented following fall registration for the session of 1941-42. The tentative budget was adopted. MISCELLANEOUS FELLOWSHIP AND SCHOLARSHIP AWARDS: A list of the miscellaneous fellowship and scholarship awards which had been made to date for the following session, was presented for the information of the Board. The list will be found spread on the Scholarship Book. ELECTIONS DURING THE SUMMER: The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED, by the Board of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President, in consultation with the Deans and Committees appointed by the President from the staff, be empowered during the summer to employ those professors who have been authorized by the Board, but who have not yet been selected. It is understood that all actions of the President are committees will be brought to the Rector and Visitors for ratification at their next meeting. The meeting then adjourned to September 26, 1941 at 11 o'clock A. M. R. Gray Williams RECTOR. E. I. Carruthersa SECRETARY.</field>

I am advised that a property consisting of some nine or more acres of land with large stone residence and several outbuildings thereon and situated on the Ivy Road about one mile west of the University may be purchased at a reasonable price, and when certain structual changes and improvements are made in the buildings it will be adapted to this purpose. I, therefore, desire to give you the sum of Fifty Thousand dollars to be used by you in the purchase of this property, in making such changes, improvements and additions to the buildings, and improvements to the grounds, as you may see fit, and for equipping and maintaining this property as a home for Crippled Children so long as the necessity therefor may exist. If, at any time in the future changed conditions should, in your sound judgment, render the continued operation of the home inadvisable, you are authorized to discontinue such operation and, either use the property for other purposes in connection with the University Hospital, or to sell and convey it applying the proceeds to such other uses of the Hospital as you may think best. It will be a source of gratification to me if you should see fit to designate the institution and have it known as "The William James Rucker Home for Convalescent Children", but I do not make this a condition to my gift. This letter will be presented to you by my friend, Mr. W. Allan Perkins, and I will appreciate your advising him of your desires in the matter as soon as may be convenient. Sincerely yours, (Signed) William J. Rucker</field>
