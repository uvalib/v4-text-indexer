After giving every consideration to the matter, the following motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted: The heart of student discipline at the University of Virginia is the honor system. Since June, 1842, the student body has exercised complete authority in the operation of the honor system. In the catalogue of this Institution is the statement that the administration of the system "is entirely in the hands of the students" and that "the essence of the system" is "that the violation of a student's word of honor is an offense not against the University authorities but against the whole student body, and on the rare occasions on which it has occurred, the students themselves have quietly and promptly sent the offender away from the University without need of faculty action." Every student on matriculation subscribes to the support of the honor system and the Board of Visitors finds no justification for its interference in the decision of the Honor Committee in this case and must respectfully decline to take any action with reference thereto. The meeting then adjourned. C. Harding Walker Rector. E. I. Carruthers Secretary.</field>
