Should the fraternity elect to build said house, it is distinctly understood that it accepts the lot herein mentioned upon such terms and conditions as are laid down in the printed rules and regulations of the University touching such houses, as follows: "#136. Any of the societies or fraternities having chapters or permanent organizations among the students of the University which shall present evidence of their pecuniary ability to erect such a hall for their own use as shall present in durability, safety and style, an appearance in keeping with the other buildings of the University will be authorized to erect such building upon the grounds of the University for their own use subject to the following conditions, to wit: (1). Such building shall be of brick covered with metal or slate, and of such dimensions, style and according to such plans and specifications, and on such site as shall be approved by the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings and accepted by the Board or the Executive Committee. (2). No such erection shall be commenced without an express waiver on the part of the general contractor or contractors of the right to any mechanics' or builders' or other lien, and the ampler to guarantee against any such lien by any sub-contractor or furnisher of materials; it being the express purpose of the Board to exclude the possibility of such liens being asserted against the grounds occupied or the building to be erected. (3). All such erections shall become the property of the University, subject, however, to such reasonable use by the society erecting the same or its individual members as shall be approved by the Board of Visitors or such subordinate authority as the Board shall designate. (4) During the use and occupation of such buildings by such society the same shall be cared for and kept in order and such repair as the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings shall require at the expense of the society which erected the same, and without charge to the University (5) If any such building shall cease to be used for the purposes of such society and in a manner satisfactory to the Board for the period of one session the same shall be taken fully in charge by the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings as to all intents and purposes one of the buildings of the University, subject to be thenceforth applied to such use as the Board may from time to time prescribe. (6) If after such building has been taken in charge for the University the society by which it was originally erected shall be resuscitated and make application to the Board for its restoration to their uses, it shall be for the Board to determine whether or no in the interest of the University such restoration shall be made. (7) All such buildings shall be at all times as fully subject to inspection and visitation by the authorities of the University, and for police purposes and the ends of discipline as any of the public buildings of the University. (8) Every contract in respect to such buildings shall be made with the Executive Committee, reduced to writing, in advance, and shall be spread upon the minute book of the Board." (Laws of the University of Virginia, 1897. Ch. IV, # 136, p.36 et seq.) Whereas George H. Byrd, Esquire of the City of New York has by his letter dated June 12th 1899 to the Rector &amp; Visitors of the University of Virginia expressed his desire to present to the University of Virginia forty shares of the Capital stock of the Atlanta &amp; Charlotte Air Line Railway Company and, and six thousand dollars of the Century Bonds of the State of Virginia, the said stock and Bonds aggregating $10,000, face value upon the terms and conditions in said letter stated, to wit: First. the said securities shall be set apart as "The Alfred Henry Byrd Endowment fund in aid of the Library of the University of Virginia" Second. Said securities shall be held by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia in trust, the income alone to be used for the purchase of books relating to the history and letters of the State of Virginia with its present limits, and also relating to any other territory which at any time may have formed part of the State or Colony of Virginia. Third. In case at any time it shall be deemed for the interest of the endowment that the securities should be sold and the proceeds invested in other securities, it is understood that the re-investment shall be in securities of the best class, the safety being looked at more than largeness of return. Fourth. In no event shall the principal be reduced for any purpose, nor shall any portion of the principal be used for any purpose not indicated above. Resolved - The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia hereby accept the gift offered by George H. Byrd, Esquire, upon the terms and conditions set forth in his letter of June 12, 1899 The Board desires to express its gratitude to Mr. George H. Byrd for his liberal and important contribution for preserving the records of the History and Literature of Virginia, which the Board deems a specially appropriate memorial to his gifted son, Alfred Henry Byrd, who was at once distinguished not more for his great success as a student here than for his personal love for the University of Virginia. The Board orders that every book purchased with the revenue derived from the Alfred Henry Byrd fund shall have printed clearly on a card to be pasted on the inside cover of such book the following words - "Purchased by the Alfred Henry Byrd endowment fund in aid of the Library of the University of Virginia". The Proctor is hereby directed to deposit the said stock and bonds constituting the Alfred Henry Byrd endowment fund with the Virginia Trust Company as soon as he receives them, and shall keep a separate account of the Revenue therefrom. The Proctor is further directed to use the Revenue from said fund only in paying for Books purchased in accordance with the terms of said Endowment. The Secretary is directed to send a copy of these resolutions to George H. Byrd, Esqre. Whereas at the last meeting of this Board a communication was received from the Trustees of the Miller fund questioning whether the fund was being applied in the manner contemplated by the donor; and this Board having heard a statement from Professor Tuttle showing the scope of instruction in the Agricultural department. Resolved, that Daniel Harmon be appointed a Committee on the part of this Board to meet the Executive Committee of the Miller Board, and with the members of the Faculty of the Department of Agriculture and the Chairman of the Faculty to confer with them on the subject, with authority to the said Committee to take such temporary action in the premises pending a meeting of this Board as in his judgment may be proper. But it is not intended hereby to concede in any way that the conditions of the donation are not now being complied with. Resolved, that the Rector and Visitors of the University express their thanks to Dr Geo. Ben Johnston for his gift to the University Library of the bust of the scholar, orator and patriot, William C. Preston by the sculptor, Hiram Powers. Resolved, that the sum of $800. be and the same is hereby appropriated, to be expended under the direction of the Committee of the medical faculty which has in charge the building &amp; equipment of the new hospital in paying the expenses of securing contributions to complete the hospital. Resolved, that the application of Mr F. W. Page, Librarian, for an increase of salary be declined. Resolved, that the following applications be laid over for consideration at the June meeting next viz= Application of Prof. Peters for increase of the salary of his assistant: Application of Profrs Barringer, Christian and Buckmaster to have their salaries, as Physicians to the students, restored to $500. per annum. Resolved, that the request of the Chairman of the on Advertising Committee in regard to the retention of Mr Patton and the Committee's Stenographer till April 1, 1900, be granted and that the amount of $3000. be appropriated for advertising purposes for the next ensuing year, the same to be available April 1, 1900. Resolved, that the Proctor be and is hereby authorized to permit the General Athletic Association to use and occupy the basement rooms and one room on the principal floor of the Alumni building, also the kitchen room of the house in the yard of said building. The Proctor shall make such provision &amp; regulations as he thinks proper for the control of the use of said rooms. The Board takes this occasion to express its approval of the efforts of the General Athletic Association to erect a building to be located for its use as training quarters and it is the purpose of the Board to permit the building to be located in its grounds upon the same conditions &amp; restrictions relating to fraternity buildings and also to give pecuniary assistance towards the erection of the same when the Association gives assurance of its having hand the necessary funds to complete it. The Executive Committee reported that they had decided, in keeping with the resolution of the Board last June, that it was expedient to create an Associate Professorship of Romance Languages at a salary of $2,000. and that they had elected Mr R. H. Wilson to this position. The report of the Executive Committee was received and the action of the Committee was approved and the election of Mr. Wilson ratified. Resolved, that McGuier's University School of Richmond be given a scholarship for the next session - 1900-1901, in keeping with the resolutions of the Board as published in the Catalogue, page 135, in view of the fact that there are sixteen of the former students of the above school who have just entered this University, and although only four are directly from the McGuire School's last sessions roll, that the phraseology of the said Board's resolutions be waived in this respect. Whereas there is now in hand the sum of $9200. of the Fayerweather money heretofore appropriated for a hospital, the Medical faculty having in charge the building of the hospital are directed to proceed with the work, but without authority to incur any liability beyond the amount in hand and to continue the work of building and equiping the hospital as the funds are received.

Fourth - The following schedule of fees for the classes of the Law Department is adopted: 7 or more classes $115. 6 classes (reg. course) 100. 5 classes 85. 4 classes 75. 3 classes 60. 2 classes 45. 1 classes 25.
