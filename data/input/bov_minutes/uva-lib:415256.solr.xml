The President read a letter he had received from Dr. Hopkins with reference to his proposed gifts to the University. It was decided to have the University's Counsel prepare a statute to enable the University to accept the proposed gift. The following offered by Mr. White, was adopted: The letter of Mr. R. Hall McCormick having been read by Dr. Alderman, wherein he suggests that the control of the Observatory be committed to a Board of Directors as a condition to his gift of $2,000. a year "for the present", after discussion, it was RESOLVED: That Mr. McCormick be advised that the University is administered under the laws of Virginia which forbid the acceptance of the gift upon the conditions imposed by him.

The Rector and Visitors wish to give expression to their sense of appreciation of the invaluable services Dr. Page has rendered the University as one of its most distinguished professors, as Dean of the University, and as acting president during the absence of the President. Impelled by their solicitude on account of his indisposition, the Rector and Visitors cannot refrain from uttering a word of sympathy to Dr. Page. During the years of their association with Dr. Page, they have learned to regard him with respect and admiration, and they avail themselves of this opportunity to extend to him their cordial good wishes, with assurances of their esteem and friendship. Upon the request of the President, the following members were named as a committee on Legislative Program: The Rector, and Messrs, Hatton, Irvine, Michie and the President.
