Mr. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, brought to the attention of the Board the correspondence had with George Latham Fletcher of Warrenton, Va., in the matter of substitution of Mr. Walter H. Robertson as administrator and trustee of the estate of Miss Mary Amelia Smith, deceased, in the place of Thomas Smith, removed, and the following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED: That the action of W. Allan Perkins, Attorney, in agreeing to the substitution of Walter H. Robertson of Warrenton, Va., as Administrator of the estate of Miss Mary Amelia Smith in the place of Colonel Thomas Smith, removed, as outlined in Mr. Perkins' letter to George Latham Fletcher of Warrenton, Va., under date of June 9, 1916, be and is hereby approved, ratified and confirmed. It is further RESOLVED: That Mr. Perkins be and is hereby instructed to take such steps as in his opinion may be proper, looking toward the proper substitution of a Trustee for the University of Virginia in the place of the said Colonel Thomas Smith, in order that any funds to which the University of Virginia may be entitled under contract of November 20, 1912, between the said University and said Thomas Smith and Frederick Waugh Smith may be properly secured to it. Mr. Perkins' letter follows: Charlottesville, Virginia, June the 9th, 1916. George Latham Fletcher Esq., Attorney-at-law, Warrenton, Va. Dear Sir:- After receiving the information which has been given me to-day, in conference with yourself and Mr. Richards, in the matter of the substitution of administrator of the estate of Miss Mary Amelia Smith, deceased, in the place and stead of Thomas Smith, removed, I feel that the interest of the University of Virginia will be promoted by the appointment of Mr. Walter H. Robertson, in accordance with the plan which you and Mr. Richards outlined. As attorney for the University of Virginia, therefore, I beg to request that you will take such steps as you may deem necessary to consummate this arrangement, and to have Mr. Robertson substituted as administrator, as aforesaid. I also ask that, in the order appointing Mr. Robertson you will let it appear that he is not only appointed as administrator d. b. m., w. w. a., but that as such he shall act as trustee in the place and stead of the said Thomas Smith, under the contract between the University of Virginia, the said Thomas Smith and Frederick Waugh Smith, dated November the 20th, 1912. Very sincerely yours, P/W (signed) W. Allan Perkins. The advisability of changing the regulations governing the appointments to Thomas F. Ryan Scholarships was discussed, and the following adopted: RESOLVED: That a committee of three be appointed to consider the Ryan Scholarships, and report recommendations to the Board. The Rector appointed President Alderman, and Visitors Norton, and Hatton on said committee. President Alderman announced the following gift to the Electrical Laboratory from The Sangamo Electric Company of Springfield, Ill., through Associate Prof. W. S. Rodman: 1 Electric Railway Economy Meter, 600 volts, 100 amperes # 479729 with resistance box $73.00 1 Ampere Hour Meter Type MS, 15 amperes # 3845, 29.00 1 D. C. Mercury Wattnour Meter Type D5, 110 volts, 10 amperes # 466932, 29.00 1 A. C. Induction Watthour Meter Type H, 110 volts, 5 amperes 60 cycles, 2 wire # 471038, 16.50 The Miller Board of Trustees reported that in accordance with the recommendation of the professor of the Miller School of Biology, it had adopted the following suggestions with reference to the appointment of the two-year Miller Scholarships and the filling of one of them for the next session by temporary appointment, and submitted same for ratification. That the two-year scholarships are awarded, one at the end of each academic year, to the candidate intending to continue scientific work, who passes, with the highest aggregate of grades, Chemistry B-1 and Biology B-1. That since no qualified candidate has appeared, and since the services of these men are very badly needed, Mr. B. D. Reynolds, an earnest and deserving Virginia boy, who has done excellent work this year in Zoology B-1, be appointed for the session of 1916-17, in order to tide the school over until next year. These recommendations were approved. The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED: That a scholarship in the Academic Department with the remission to the holder of tuition fee, be established, to be known as the "Alabama Federation of Women's Clubs Scholarship", and that this scholarship be awarded annually by the Rector and Visitors of the University on the recommendation of the Scholarship Committee of the Alabama Federation of Women's Clubs to a stu- dent from Alabam who is in need of financial assistance. The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia desire to place on record an expression of their profound and lasting regret at the death of Richard Henry Whitehead for eleven years Professor of Anatomy and Dean of the Department of Medicine. These eleven years were transitional and formative years in the history of the ancient school of medicine in the University. They were years requiring reconstructive ability, insight into the changing nature of modern medicine, and intense devotion to medical science. In all these fields, Richard Henry Whitehead gave evidence of the possession of unusual genius and ability and the University, as a whole, and the Medical Department, as one of its units, are under lasting obligations to him for his career of achievement and service. On motion, the Board then adjourned. [signed] Armistead C. Gordon Rector. [signed] E. I. Carruthers Secretary.</field>
