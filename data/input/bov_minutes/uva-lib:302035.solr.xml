Dear Mr. Moran - Enclosed please find copy of my letter to The Virginia Trust Co. of this State, which you will please file as my report on the loan of $12,000.00 to Messrs. A. W. Mosby and H. E. DeWitt. I will see that the permanent insurance policies are forwarded to The Virginia Trust Company at an early date. Yours truly, (signed) John W. Craddock. Lynchburg, Va., Jan'y. 8, 1908. Virginia Trust Company, Richmond, Va. Mr. Mann S. Quarles, Vice-President, Dear Sir:- I am sending you herewith, for the account of the Rec- tor and Visitors of the University of Virginia: a. Bond of $10,000.00 of A. W. Mosby and H. E. DeWitt, payable five years from January 1, 1908, with interest at six per cent, evidenced by coupons, payable January 1st and July 1st. This bond is to be entered as the James C. Carter Bequest and so carried on your books. b. Bond of A. W. Mosby and H. E. DeWitt, of $2,000.00, maturing five years from January 1, 1908, bearing interest at six per cent., payable semi-annually, January 1st and July 1st, evidenced by coupons. This amount is to be credited and carried as the Valentine Birely Scholarship Fund. c. Deed of Trust, properly recorded, on business property, located on Main Street, Lynchburg, Virginia, securing these bonds. d. Abstract of title to property, prepared by Sackett &amp; Sacks, Attorneys, Lynchburg, Va. The form of bonds, deed of trust and abstract of title have been examined and approved by John B. Moon, Attorney for the University. I have, in my possession, Builders' Risk insurance policy, to cover the building, which is now nearing completion, for $5,000.00. As soon as the building is completed, I will have the permanent insurance for $10,000.00 taken out and forwarded to you, to be filed with these papers, as is contemplated in the deed of trust. The lot is valued at between $8,000.00 and $10,000.00, and the building will cost $17,000.00. Kindly acknowlege receipt of these papers; and I will thank you also, to advise me of your decision in reference to the matter of compensation on the bond transaction with the National Exchange Bank. I have not heard from you in answer to my last letter, which I suppose is due to press of business upon you at this period. With cordial regards, I am, Yours truly, (signed) John W. Craddock. Lynchburg, Va., Jan'y. 13, 1908. Mr. I. K. Moran, Bursar, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va. Dear Mr. Moran:- The Virginia Trust Company insists upon its charge of $150.00 for its services with the loan of bonds to the National Exchange Bank. Mr. Gilliam, President of the Bank, took the position, in which I concurred, that $50.00 was a fair amount for his bank to pay for this service, and, while I feel that the charge of the Virginia Trust Company is somewhat excessive, inasmuch as they have declined to reduce it, I have authorized them to charge the account of the University of Virginia with $100.00, in settlement of balance on this transaction. This act on my part was authorized by the Visitors at the last meeting of the Board. Yours truly, (signed) John W. Craddock, Chairman Finance Committee. On motion, the Board adjourned. I. K. Moran Secretary. Armistead C. Gordon Rector.</field>
