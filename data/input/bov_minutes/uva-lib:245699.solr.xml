The Committee on the water supply laid before the Board a copy of an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Charlottesville for the consideration of the Board &amp; which reads as follows: Be it ordained by the City Council of Charlottesville that the City by its Mayor enter into a contract with the Rector &amp; Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia to the following effect, to wit: That in consideration of the surrender to the City of Charlottesville by the said Rector &amp; Board of Visitors of the University of Va, of its entire interest in the present main from the Reservoir to, and into the City of Charlottesville, and in consideration of ($2,200.) Twenty two hundred dollars to be paid to the University of Virginia by the City of Charlottesville out of the levy for 1892, the said Rector &amp; Board of Visitors shall have the right to connect at its own expense its water supply system from the point where its system now connects with the present 10 inch main by a 6 inch main to and into the Reservoir, and the said 6 inch main to be reduced to a (4) four inch main for the University of Virginia water supply: Provided such connection can be made through the Dam tunnel without injury to said Dam or gate-house. The control and supervision of the Reservoir to remain in the City control as it now exists under the original contract between the University of Virginia and the City of Charlottesville dated the 20th day of January 1885. This agreement is in nowise to alter or change the proper accounting between said city and University of Virginia for any matter of liability existing prior to this date. The said 6 inch main not to be tapped. The fire plugs now connecting on the 10 inch main within the University of Virginia are to remain and to be used only by the University for extinguishing fires. Oct. 27/91 Copy Teste, John M. Godwin, Clerk. After consideration of the subject Mr Parrish offered the following resolutions which were approved and adopted by a unanimous vote: Resolved that the Rector on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia be directed to enter into a contract with the city of Charlottesville by which the University shall release and convey to said city its entire interest in the present ten inch water main leading from the reservoir to said city, in consideration of the sum of Twenty two hundred Dollars, with a provision in said contract allowing the University to connect its present pipes with the reservoir by a six inch main leading into and through the University grounds, provided that no distributing pipe shall exceed four inches in diameter, and provided further that nothing in said contract shall be construed as to alter the ration of ownership of the reservoir and water supply on the part of the University and the City as it now exists, and provided further that the fire plugs on said ten inch main shall remain as they now stand for use in cases of fire only. II That the contract provide that the six inch main be connected with the reservoir in such manner as not to do permanent injury to the Dam or Gate House, and that the supervision and control of the Reservoir remain as it now exists. III That no water shall be used outside of the University property from said six inch main, and that all unsettled liabilities growing out of the water supply plant shall be settled under the existing contract, which shall be preserved except as specially changed by the proposed contract. The following resolution was adopted by a unanimous vote: Resolved, that the sum of $14000.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary be appropriated for the purpose of laying an independent water main from the present reservoir to the University, but that the laying of said main and the expenditure of said appropriation be under the supervision of the Executive Committee &amp; the Proctor. After consideration of the proposition of the Executors of D. B. Faerweather decd to pay 25% of the legacy to the University, forthwith, after deducting taxes &amp; interest, the following resolution was adopted: Whereas it is proposed by the Executors of the late D. B. Faerweather to pay 25 per cent of the legacy left the University provided the state tax of $1000. is deducted therefrom and the interest on said 25 per cent is deducted from the time of payment to the end of the year, to wit, the 28th of Feb. 1892 and whereas the Board is disinclined to accept said proposal for the reason that at present it has no use for the money and for the further reason that it does not understand why it should be required to pay interest on money that is shown to be in hand and therefore ready for distribution, but if it is to the interest of the University to accept said proposal and submit to the deduction of interest and tax aforesaid, it feels bound to do so. Therefore it is Resolved, that the Rector after advising with the New York counsel, Mr R. C. Taylor, be directed to settle said legacy on such terms as he may think to the best interest of the University. The communication from certain M. A.s of remonstrance against change in the M. A. degree, on motion was referred to the Conduct of Schools for report. The following resolutions were adopted: Resolved, that the Proctor be requested to make a special annual report to the Finance Committee of the securities held by the University, together with the market value of said securities, making such recommendations as to the changing of the same as he may deem proper. Resolved, I That the Board is inclined to give a favorable consideration to the recommendation of the Faculty and the Petition of the students in respect to providing adequate facilities for physical culture but at this time deems it best to wait until the funds shall be in hand before making any appropriation. II That the Proctor be instructed to obtain at a cost to be authorized by the Executive Committee, proper plans and specifications for a suitable Gymnasium with its equipment, and baths for the use of the students, the whole not to exceed in cost the sum of $15000. Resolved, that the Rector take charge of and have presented to the General Assembly a bill to authorize the commutation into money of the legacy to the University under the will of A. W. Austin &amp; take such steps as may be necessary to procure the passage of said bill. Whereas sundry persons have, by will and otherwise, donated large sums of money to the University, and whereas it is the unanimous sense of the Board that all such gifts should be kept inact as to the principal, in order to keep each doner's name connected with his original gift, it is Resolved, that in all cases in which the Board shall find it necessary to use any part of the principal of any such gift, the money so used shall be treated as a loan from the particular fund from which it is derived, and that a sinking fund be created from the interest accruing from such original fund, which sinking fund shall be used to refund the money so borrowed as aforesaid. Resolved, that the salary of Mr Sigerfoos, assistant to Profr Tuttle, be fixed at Eight hundred dollars for the present session, and that the sum heretofore appropriated for the equipment of Profr Tuttle's Department be reduced to seven hundred dollars. Resolved, that the application of Dr Dabney for an addition to his Pavilion be referred to the Proctor, with instructions to procure plans and specifications for such addition as may be desired, together with an estimate of the cost of same, and to report to the next meeting of the Board. Resolved, that the gift of the "old bell" to the University by Professors Tuttle, Stone &amp; Towles be accepted with the thanks of the Rector and Visitors for the same, and that the Proctor be directed to place the bell in an appropriate place in the Brooks Museum. Resolved, that the resolution adopted at the last meeting changing the time of the annual meeting of the Board be rescinded, and that the Board hereafter hold their annual meetings at the time fixed by the law prior to the passage of the said resolution. Resolved, that the application of Profr Tuttle to make his a compulsory two years course, the consideration of which was postponed at the last annual meeting be further postponed until the next annual meeting. The Committee on the Conduct of Schools &amp; Examination of Students submitted the following as its report which was read and on motion the same was approved &amp; its recommendations adopted by a unanimous vote: Oct 30th 1891 Your Committee on the Conduct of Schools begs leave to report as follows on the petitions referred to it this day: 1. That the request of Profr Perkinson for an Assistant be granted for the rest of the present session, said Assistant to receive compensation at the rate of $400. per session. 2.

A. degree at the end of the present session upon terms not authorized by the laws of the University. 3. That the Faculty be sustained in their disapproval of the application of Mr R. E. L. Farmer to receive the M. A. degree at the end of the present session upon terms not authorized by the laws of the University. 4. That the petition of Mr W. A.

That the petition of Mr E. W. Roby for a reduction of the regular fees for tuition in the Law Department be disallowed. 8. That as this Committee has not sufficient time to consider carefully at this called meeting the protest of certain Masters of Arts against the change in the M. A. degree, the Committee respectfully requests further time to report on the same to the Board. W. Gordon McCabe, Chairman R. G. H. Kean R. L. Parrish The report of the Health Committee of the Faculty was read &amp; considered and on motion the following resolution in respect thereto was adopted: Resolved, that the Proctor be directed to fix the ditch above the ice pond, so as to prevent any drainage from the geological Hall and any other pollution from entering said pond, and that he shall have provided coolers for ice water supplied the students in which the ice will be put in separate compartments from that containing the water. The recommendation of the Faculty in regard to a new ice pond is postponed until the next meeting of the Board. On motion the Board adjourned sine die. W. C. N. Randolph Rector Jas D. Jones, Secretary.</field>
