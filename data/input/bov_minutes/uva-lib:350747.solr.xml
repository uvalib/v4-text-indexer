REPORT OF ATHLETIC COMMITTEE Mr. Talbott, Chairman of the Athletic Committee, presented the following report: TENTATIVE REPORT OF ATHLETIC COMMITTEE The undersigned committee recommends that the following be stated as the policy of the University concerning grants-in-aid to students from funds supplied by the University of Virginia Alumni Association or the Virginia Student Aid Foundation. 1. The purpose of the named organizations to provide funds for the education of qualified students is recognized and considered to be desirable. 2. Funds or securities provided for such grants-in-aid shall be deposited with the Bursar of the University and, after acceptance as hereinafter provided, shall be applied by him toward payment of University fees and the reasonable cost of board, room, laundry and books incurred by students to whom award shall be made. 3. The Committee on Scholarships, Loans, and Employment will have responsibility to make all such awards upon nominations of the donors, respectively. If any nominee is rejected by the Committee, it may not make an award to another not so nominated 4. Funds deposited with the Bursar unexpended and uncommitted for grants-in-aid shall be refunded to the donor by the Bursar, on written request therefor 5. Awards shall be available only to students in good academic standing and to prospective students, but conditioned as to the latter upon their meeting established entrance requirements 6. Such grants-in-aid shall be awarded and administered in strict compliance with the rules and regulations of the National Collegiate Athletic Association 7. The Board of Visitors will, by resolution, accept funds or securities deposited with the Bursar, by the donors respectively, for disposition under the conditions here specified Respectively submitted, /s/ Frank Talbott, Jr., Chairman /s/ Whitwell W. Coxe /s/ Bm W. M Mr. Gay did not participate in the discussion nor have a chance to present his views concerning this matter, being unable to attend either the committee meeting or the Board meeting. Mr. Talbott stated that all parties concerned had approved the proposal with the exception of the Student Aid Foundation, which wished more restrictions placed on the award of the scholarships. After discussion of the matter, the Board received the report in tentative form and requested the Secretary to have the report mimeographed and distribute copies to the members of the Board of Visitors, the Director of Athletics, the President of the Alumni Association, the Chairman of the Advisory Council on Athletics, and the President of the Student Aid Foundation. The Chairman of the Athletic Committee was requested to meet with the Director of Athletics and arrange a conference with the officers of the Student Aid Foundation to attempt to reconcile their views with the report of the Athletic Committee. If unable to get their agreement, the Chairman should request suggestions which could be presented to the Board at its next meeting. LAW ALUMNI ASSOCIATION Mr. Stuart Campbell, Chairman, Mr. Thomas Michie, Mr. O'Conor Goolrick, and Mr. George Cochrane of the Law Alumni Association, appeared before the Board to request an increase in the salary scale of the Law Faculty. Mr. Campbell spoke for the Law Alumni. Specifically, they requested the following 3 Professors at $12,500 4 Professors at 10,000 1 Professor at 8,500 4 Professors at 8,000 2 Assoc. Professors at 6,000 They estimate that this will cost the University $9,700 per year if the present bonus is continued, or $14,000 per year if the bonus is discontinued. In support of their request, Mr. Campbell stated that the University Law School is classified by the American Bar Association among the top 13 schools, but that its salary scale placed it 12, as shown in the table below. The increases proposed would make us rank 8 Name of University Professors Assoc. Professors High Low High Low Columbia (Not given) Start at $8,000 Objective $15,000 for all full professors, but average is about $14,000 Duke $11,000 $ 9,100 $8,500 $7,500 Harvard 15,000 10,000 -- -- Illinois 12,900 9,000 7,900 7,900 Indiana (Bloomington) 11,750 10,500 8,500 7,000 Iowa 11,500 8,000 -- -- Michigan 15,160 10,500 12,700 10,000 Northwestern 13,000 9,750 9,000 7,500 Pennsylvania 15,000 11,700 10,000 9,200 Texas 9,600 9,600 (Distinguished Profs.) 7,900 5,900 5,700 4,800 (Professors) Wisconsin 11,150 8,000 8,000 5,750 Yale 15,00 10,000 10,000 7,500 - - - - - - - - Messrs. Michie, Goolrick, and Cochrane spoke briefly in support of Mr. Campbell's proposal. Mr. Black, on behalf of the Board, stated that the Board was in a dilemma as there was now a sizeable disparity between the salary scale in the Law and Medical Schools and the other schools of the University. He thought it would be most difficult for the President and the Board to request an increase for the Law School without a comparable increase for the other schools. He suggested that efforts be made through the recently established Law School Foundation to raise the $9,700 necessary to make this scale possible. He said he believed that enough funds could be raised to increase the scale to $15,000 Mr. Campbell stated that the Committee hoped that the State would provide the scale requested and that the Law Alumni would raise the additional amount necessary to make possible a top pay of $15,000 for the faculty The Rector thanked the members of the Law Alumni Association for appearing, whereupon, they left the meeting. After further discussion of the matter, the President was asked to meet with the Law Alumni and discuss (1) the raising of funds necessary through private gifts, and (2) the presentation to the Legislature of a request for a general increase in faculty salaries in the University MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE MATTERS RESIGNATION Dr. Arthur L. Vogelback, Professor of English, resigned to accept the position as Dean of Ripon College, Ripon, Wisconsin. LEAVE OF ABSENCE The following resolution was adopted by the Board: RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the request of Dr. Almont Lindsey, Professor of History, for a leave of absence for the session 1953-54 be and the same is hereby granted.

Sublette, Assistant Professor to Associate Professor of Political Science, effective September 1953, at a salary of $4,200.
