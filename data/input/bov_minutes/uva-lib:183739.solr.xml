      <field name="fulltext">ATTACHMENT A UNIVERSITY POLICY ON USE OF THE LAWN [This policy was originally adopted by President Robert M. O'Neil upon his receipt of the Final Report of the President's Ad Hoc Committee on the Use of the Lawn, dated September 24, 1986. That Policy was accepted by the Board of Visitors at its October, 1986 meeting. Subsequently, on May 15, 1987, President O'Neil amended paragraph B of the Policy.] This report addresses the uses of that part of the University of Virginia Historic District which includes the entire area between McCormick Road and Hospital Drive (on the West and East, respectively) and University Avenue and the Boundary formed by Pavilions IX and X, Rouss Hall, Old Cabell, and Cocke Hall (on the North and South, respectively). Excluded, for example, is the Amphitheater. The Lawn is the geographical and spiritual heart of the University. The entire University Community -- students, faculty, administrators -- are its trustees, as well as the beneficiaries of this beauty and usefulness. To us who are here now have been given both all the benefits that we currently enjoy from the Lawn and also the obligation to preserve those benefits for future generations. We emphasize that the Lawn has extremely diverse uses and characteristics, among which are the following: 1. It is a national and international historic treasure. 2. It is a center of highly varied day-to-day academic activities. 3. It is used occasionally as a setting for University activities, such as official convocations. 4. It is a residential precinct for students and faculty. 5. It is an area for limited active and passive outdoor recreational activities. 6. It is a site for a steady stream of visitors and tourists from all over the world. The University Community has developed a proud tradition of mutual accommodations of all these diverse uses. The Lawn must perforce be open and accessible under reasonable rules and regulations (many of which are and have long been in place, administered, a.o., by the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, the Rotunda Administration, et al.). The Lawn is replete with fragile, delicate structures and landscape content. Preservation is a constant concern and a burgeoning curatorial responsibility. That responsibility has been entrusted to the University as part of its fiduciary obligations to future generations. The danger that misuse of the Lawn presents to the historic edifices, and to their dependencies and surroundings, are real, not theoretical. Differing rules and regulations may apply to different parts of the Lawn -- e.g., the lower terrace may be governed by different safety precautions and regulations from those that apply to the upper three terraces. Moreover, space limitations and the plethora of requests for facilities perforce dictate orderly administrative rules, always provided that these rules will be content neutral. Pursuant to the foregoing reflections and considerations, your committee therefore resolves: A. That the gardens of the Pavilions are public areas. Those garden areas adjacent to the Pavilions are not required to be open to the public at all times. They are to be open when not in personal use, and they must be open on certain occasions, e.g., Garden Week. To temporarily close these adjacent gardens for personal use by the Pavilion residents, an appropriate sign may be placed upon the gates notifying the public. Where the garden is divided into two portions by an intervening wall, the remote section shall be open to the public at all times. The use of the gardens for social gatherings of University organizations is to be permitted where consistent with the occupancy of the Pavilion as home by the resident. B. That for the upper terraces of the Lawn (those between the Rotunda and the crosswalk at the northern limit of the "Homer Terrace" at the South) no structure shall be permitted on the Lawn except for those needed in connection with official University functions. (The term "structure" includes props and displays, such as coffins, crates, crosses, theaters, cages, and statues; furniture, and furnishings, such as desks, tables, (except those temporarily used by participants in the ceremonies or by University officials for the conduct of the ceremonies), bookcases, and cabinets; shelters, such as tents, boxes, shanties and other enclosures; and other similar physical structures. The term "structure" does not include chairs, signs held by hand, bicycles, baby carriages, and baby strollers temporarily placed in, or being moved across the Lawn; and wheelchairs and other devices for the handicapped when used by handicapped persons.) The same rule shall be in effect for the lower ("Homer") terrace, except that for that area of the Lawn officially recognized student groups, academic or administrative departments, or University-related organizations or foundations may be granted use by the Office of the Dean of Students. That office will consider use in accordance with dictates affecting time, place, and manner. Among them are the following: 1. The use of the designated space ("Homer Terrace") by any one group at any time shall not exceed three consecutive days. 2. Disruption or obstruction of teaching, research, administration, disciplinary procedure, or other University activities, or of other authorized activities on University property is forbidden.

      <field name="fulltext">ATTACHMENT B = Amendment or the Replacement Hospital Construction Management Contract DRAFT ADDENDUM This Addendum, dated as of __________________, is between The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia ("Owner") and Barton-Malow, Inc., a corporation, and CRS Constructors Managers, Inc., a corporation, trading as Barton-Malow/CRS, a Joint Venture, ("Construction Manager") and constitutes a written addition to the Contract, dated as of October 4, 1984, between the Owner and the Construction Manager, pursuant to Section 1.1.1. of the Contract. The Owner and the Construction Manager wish to amend the scope of the Contract to include the construction of an addition known as Vertical and Horizontal Extension to the Replacement Hospital ("Replacement Hospital Extension"), and to delete the Existing Hospital Renovation Project, with the exception of specific work as described below. The Replacement Hospital Extension includes the addition of seventh and eighth floors, mechanical penthouses serving these floors, and additions to Levels 0, 1, and 2. The total area of this extension is approximately 190,000 sq. ft. and it includes the following functional areas: Level 0 - Medical Center Physical Plant Materiel Management Clinical Engineering Pharmacy Respiratory Therapy Level 1 - Transportation Radiology Medical Records/Admitting Level 2 - Surgery Laboratory Central Sterile Supply Admit-Discharge Unit Blood Bank Level 7 - Pediatrics, including PICU and NICU Burn Center Level 8 - Obstetrics Labor/Delivery LDRP Clinical Research Center Nursery NOW, THEREFORE, the Owner and the Construction Manager agree as follows: 1. The Replacement Hospital Extension is added to the overall Project, and to the extent not inconsistent with the language and intent of this Addendum, the terms of the Contract are applicable. For example, Section 2.1.3 of the Contract requires the Construction Manager to continue to provide Pre-construction Phase services as necessary until construction has commenced on all phases of the work. The Replacement Hospital Extension is a phase of the work which requires Pre-construction Phase services until its construction has commenced. 2. The renovations to the Multistory Hospital are deleted from the Contract except the McKim Hall Renovations, PCC Level O Renovations, PCC Sprinkler Work, Multistory Hospital Loading Dock, and tying the Link to the nearest elevator in the Multistory Hospital elevator core. 3. To amend Section 1.1.4 of the Contract by adding the following provision to the end: "Project" also includes Replacement Hospital Vertical and Horizontal Extension ("Replacement Hospital Extension") as designed by Metcalf/Davis, Brody/Russo + Sonder under Contract Amendment dated September 29, 1987. 4. To amend Section 2.4 of the Contract by inserting the following paragraph after the first paragraph, as amended by Addendum dated February 17, 1986 and Addendum dated May 17, 1985. The current estimate of the construction cost limit for the Replacement Hospital Extension is $27,897,000, and the Multistory allowance is reduced by $13,546,000. 5. The Owner's Project Schedule, pursuant to Section 2.5.2 of the Contract and attached as an exhibit to the Contract, is amended by adding the Owner's Project Extension Schedule attached to this Addendum. 6. Because the Owner wishes to distinguish Expenditures on the Replacement Hospital Extension from those the remainder of the Project, funds may not be transferred between the bidding or construction contingencies of the Replacement Hospital Extension and those of the other Project elements. 7. To amend Section 5.5 of the Contract by replacing the second sentence with the following provision. The Construction Manager's fee, which includes the amounts specified in Section 5.4, is defined to be a fixed dollar amount of $13,354,500. This fee includes $522,000 for the MR-4 Addition, $379,000 for Change Order No. 57, $101,000 for Change Order No. 82, and an additional fee of $652,500 for the Replacement Hospital Extension and those portions of the Renovation not deleted from the Contract as specified in paragraph 2, above. The Construction Manager's Fee is subject to adjustment for the cost of Change Order Work as provided in Section 4.4 8. Section 4.4 of the Contract is hereby deleted in its entirety, and the following inserted in lieu thereof: 4.4 Effect on Construction Manager's Fee: If upon final completion of the Work the net of all additive and deductive Change Orders shall have resulted in an increase in the GMP to an amount greater than $171,616,502, or a decrease in the GMP to an amount less than $166,544,093, then the Construction Manager's Fee shall be increased or decreased by an amount equal to two and one-half percent (2.5) of the increase or decrease in the GMP attributable to such Change Orders beyond the amounts stated above. 9. The Construction Manager has already prepared an OMP for the Replacement Hospital Extension. The Construction Manager shall produce a GMP for the Replacement Hospital Extension within 45 days after the Owner delivers preliminary design drawings to the Construction Manager. 10. The commencement of guarantee, in accordance with Article 31(a) of Amended General Conditions, for the Replacement Hospital Extension only, shall be the date(s) of issuance of Certificate(s) of Substantial Completion as specified in Article 3.3 of the Contract. 11. To amend Article 1 of the Addendum dated October 4, 1984, as further amended by Addendum dated February 17, 1986, by including new paragraphs f and g as follows: f. Fee proposal for Vertical and Horizontal Expansion of the Replacement Hospital and Addition to the Medical Research Facility dated February 3, 1988. g. Memorandum of Understanding dated February 29, 1988. IN WITNESS WHEREF, this Addendum is hereby executed as of the date first set frtn above.
