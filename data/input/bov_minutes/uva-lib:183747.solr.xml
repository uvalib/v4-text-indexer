Per-item maintenance rates were specified for the first two years the contract was in existence, but those costs have since been subject to negotiation. Historically, maintenance fees have increased approximately 10.75% per year. In August 1989 ROLM announced a special maintenance payment plan, the Extended Maintenance Option (EMO). The EMO offers the customer discounted per-item maintenance fees, and those rates are frozen for a period of 60 months. To take advantage of the EMO the customer must prepay his maintenance costs for the five year term, and the payment is based on the customer's equipment configuration as it exists on the date the EMO becomes effective. New equipment added during the term of the EMO will be serviced at the discounted rate. As it was originally presented, the EMO pertained solely to ROLM's newest switch (the 9751), and only those customers having standard maintenance agreements qualified for the program. While the University does own a 9751 switch, it comprises only 1/18 of the total system. Further, the University's maintenance contract is non-standard. ROLM, however, has agreed to offer the EMO to the University, and it will apply to the entire system, not just the 9751. The University's EMO payment will be $5,000,000 and the cost is based on the equipment configuration that will be in place as of January 1, 1990. Equipment added during the term of the EMO will be serviced at $5.52 per item per month; the current rate is $6.12. Because there are insufficient cash reserves in Voice Communications' account to fund the initial payment, it will be necessary to obtain a loan from the University's Budget Office for the referenced amount. Equipment additions will not be financed; rather, they will be funded on a "pay as you go" basis.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">APPROVAL OF RESOLUTION REGARDING IVY CREEK PARKWAY The following resolution was adopted: WHEREAS, the University of Virginia Real Estate Foundation has for over three years been actively and publicly planning the construction of the Colonnades Life Care Center (for which ground was broken on October 4, 1989) as a means of retaining within the community larger numbers of senior and retired faculty, and WHEREAS, the Colonnades Life Care Center will aid the University's Health Sciences Center in carrying out its programs of teaching, research and patient care, including gerontology and medical and nursing care, and WHEREAS, the location of an expressway between Stillhouse Mountain and the Colonnades Life Care Center, by reason of the accompanying noise, appearance, and air pollution, could materially impair the quality of life of the residents of the Life Care Center, and thus jeopardize the vitality and success of the project, and WHEREAS, the location of a roadway within the University's North Grounds could seriously impair the quality of life and learning within the University's graduate law and business schools and the Judge Advocate General's School, and WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the University Real Estate Foundation on January 9, 1990, adopted a resolution requesting that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia formally express their opposition to construction of a bypass route between Stillhouse Mountain and the Colonnades Life Care Center, and WHEREAS, the forecast of the Virginia Department of Transportation's consultant indicates that location of the proposed Ivy Creek Parkway east or west of Stillhouse Mountain would be immaterial to its ability to divert substantial traffic from the Route 29/Emmett Street corridor, NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia hereby concurs with the Board of Directors of the University of Virginia Real Estate Foundation and declares its opposition to the construction of any road proposed for routing between Stillhouse Mountain and the Colonnades Life Care Center. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia declares its opposition to the presence of high speed traffic and the construction of a public roadway on the North Grounds of the University of Virginia. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the University administration hereby is directed to convey to the Council of the City of Charlottesville and to the Board of Supervisors of Albemarle County a statement that the University, at this time, neither endorses nor opposes the principles which undergird the City's proposal; rather, it is two specific attributes of the plan which are opposed. Moreover, the Board of Visitors encourages appropriate representatives of the City, the County, and the University to distill from the City's proposal its underlying principles, and to continue to seek to develop a proposal on which all might agree.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JEFFERSONIAN RESTORATION ADVISORY BOARD RESOLUTION ON THE USE OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS The following resolution was adopted: WHEREAS, recognizing the limited space available on the historic Grounds; the proposed future growth by the University; and the ever increasing demands on the prime space of the Academical Village; and WHEREAS, further recognizing that the original use for some of the historic buildings is no longer possible; NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that JRAB expresses its concern at any further erosion of traditional use of such space and urges that such use be only as a last resort; that it be viewed as only a temporary solution and that no irreversible structural changes be inflicted. To help achieve this end, the Design Committee of JRAB stands ready to suggest means of making necessary changes in original design as unobtrusive and as little damaging as possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPROVAL OF THE RESOLUTION ON ENROLLMENT GROWTH The following resolution was adopted: Whereas, estimates from several sources indicate that the Commonwealth of Virginia will experience major growth in its college-age population during the latter part of the 1990s and at least the early part of the first decade of the 21st Century; and Whereas, the Commission on the University of the 21st Century has urged, and the Board of Visitors concurs, that undergraduate growth should occur across an array of institutions reflecting the diversity of Virginia high school graduates, including highly selective institutions; and Whereas, the Commission also urged, and the Board of Visitors concurs, that funding for growth be separately identified to ensure that it does not occur at the expense of existing students, especially undergraduates; and Whereas, in addition to the demographic pressures expected in the Commonwealth, moderate, selective and measured enrollment growth would bring to the University of Virginia other benefits identified by the Provost of the University and by academic deans and; Whereas, the Board believes that maintenance of the excellence of the University and its improvement is its primary duty, and that any growth must be planned and financed so as to permit that duty to be performed; Therefore, be it resolved that the Board of Visitors directs the Administration to begin as soon as possible detailed planning for moderate, measured growth in undergraduate student enrollment in Charlottesville as recommended by the President, and that such planning be predicated on continued validity of the estimates of college-age population in the Commonwealth; and Be it further resolved that planning be conducted with the following assumptions: 1. Undergraduate enrollment growth should be planned to result in an eventual increase not to exceed 1,000 students in the College of Arts and Sciences, 400 in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and fewer than 100 (probably 50-75) in the Schools of Nursing, Commerce and Architecture. Such growth shall be phased and shall not begin before the academic year 1997-98. 2. Undergraduate enrollment growth shall consist predominantly of Virginia residents, while maintaining at least the current numbers of out-of-state students in order to ensure the geographical diversity that has characterized the University since the days of Thomas Jefferson. 3. Enrollment growth of the type projected here depends directly upon appropriate increases in financial support from the Commonwealth. Those increases should be clearly evident to the University community, consistent with the related recommendation of the Commission on the University of the 21st Century. Growth planning cannot proceed on the schedule envisioned here unless such resource commitments are made well ahead of actual enrollment increases. The Vice President for Business and Finance shall develop criteria by which to measure the adequacy of anticipated resources related to enrollment growth. 4. The President and the Provost shall determine, with appropriate faculty involvement, how best to match undergraduate enrollment increases to programs and areas with capacity for growth, with special emphasis on areas such as the sciences, from which educated graduates are greatly needed by the Commonwealth and the nation. 5. Moderate enrollment growth in specific graduate programs also may be included in planning, although the determination of optimal graduate program size reflects markedly different considerations from those which affect undergraduate enrollments. 6. Planning shall emphasize the combination of undergraduate enrollment growth with desired models of student life, especially residential colleges, to meet increased demand for student housing. 7. Planning shall make every reasonable attempt to incorporate the perspectives of all affected parties, including students, faculty, the University's neighbors in the surrounding community, the City of Charlottesville and Albemarle County, and the public interest at large, in developing detailed plans for University enrollment growth. Finally, be it resolved that the President shall submit an interim report on these matters to the Board by January 1, 1991, and a final plan for enrollment growth by October 1, 1991.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RESOLUTION REGARDING DEVELOPMENT The following resolution was adopted: WHEREAS, upon consideration of the need of funds for the proposed and anticipated future development of the University and the announced and reasonably anticipated reductions in public funding, it is clear that the University of Virginia will increasingly depend upon private support for funds necessary to maintain its excellence; and WHEREAS, changes that will permit greater coordination among the various entities currently engaged in raising funds on behalf of the University, including the Alumni Association and University related foundations, are necessary in order to generate increased private support; and WHEREAS, it is of the utmost importance that the rationale for such changes be clearly communicated to and understood by those entities and by those outside of the University to whom the University will look for leadership in its fund raising efforts (volunteer leaders) and that no proposal for change be implemented until adequate time has been allowed for such communication and understanding to occur; and WHEREAS, valuable work has been done over the last several months to identify areas for improvement in the University's development and fund raising efforts and to suggest changes to cause improvement and the momentum for achieving necessary change should not be lost; NOW, THEREFORE, be it resolved that: 1. The Special Committee on Development created in November, 1989 (Messrs. Lee Brown, Chairman, Scott and Wilson) shall be increased to five members, plus the Rector as an ex officio member; 2. The next President of the University should participate in the formulation of the proposed changes; and 3. To sustain the progress toward necessary change which has occurred to date, the Special Committee on Development shall proceed as necessary and with all possible promptness to bring before the Board, after discussion and consultation with the various entities engaged in fund raising on behalf of the University, including the University related foundations and the Alumni Association, a proposal for changes to improve the development and fund raising organization of the University.</field>

The stipend for RN's will be $1500, with $750 paid on or about the implementation date, and the balance paid six months later. Payment is contingent upon the Registered Nurse being actively employed on the unit(s) at the scheduled time of payment. The stipend for Licensed Practical Nurses will be $500, with $250 paid on or about the implementation date, and the balance paid six months later. Payment is contingent upon the LPN being actively employed on the unit(s) at the scheduled time of payment. Part-time classified nurses working at least a 50% schedule and who are otherwise eligible will receive a pro-rate stipend. The retention stipend will be paid from the wage payroll and will not be included in the employees' base salary. Recruitment Incentive A schedule of incentive payments will be established to facilitate recruitment of Registered Nurses into the designated units from other units in the medical center, or from outside the medical center. The availability of this incentive will be advertised to Registered Nurses in the medical center prior to external recruitment. The recruiting incentive will be $1500, and will be paid in $500 increments over 6 months. Eligibility to receive the incentive is contingent upon the Registered Nurse being actively employed in the unit at the time of the scheduled payment. The recruiting incentive will be administered as follows: on or near date of hire $ 500 three months from hire 500 six months from hire 500 --------- total $1500 The recruitment incentive will be paid from the wage payroll and will not be included in the employees' base salary. Float/Additional Hours Differential All Unit-based Registered Nurses, whether full or part time, who are floated to or volunteer to work additional hours on the designated unit(s) will receive an hourly differential of $1.50 per hour. Designated unit-based wage RN's working 20+ hours per week will be eligible for the $1.50/hour differential. This differential is not to be included in the base or overtime rate. Part-time wage RN's working additional hours in the designated units are eligible for the hourly differential, provided they do not work over 40 hours per week. Administration The stipend or incentive will be paid as a lump sum payment, and charged to the designated units. The Nursing Resources Department will submit Wage Forms to Classification and Compensation to initiate payment. Program Review Action Plan Concurrent with the implementation of the pilot program, a "Program Review Action Plan" will be developed. The Action Plan will be formatted to include a Retention Section and a Recruitment Section. The Action Plan should be presented in summary statement as opposed to narrative form. The Retention Component will include 1) a strategy for organizational assessment and evaluation which should identify key issues affecting retention; and 2) an analysis of the key issues and possible solutions. The Recruitment Component will include 1) a review of current recruiting strategies; 2) an identification of barriers/impediments to recruiting; and 3) new strategies for recruiting. Kate Fraleigh and Pam Mauck will develop the recruiting section of the Action Plan. The Program Review Action Plan shall be submitted to the Director of Nursing and the Assistant Vice President for Personnel Administration no later than 60 days after program implementation. Implementation Implementation of this program will be Jan. 1, 1990. RN's and LPN's employed in the designated units on January 1 will be eligible for the retention stipend; RN's beginning employment in the units on or after January 2, 1990 will be eligible for the recruiting incentive. Registered Nurses entering the unit after January 1 who receive the recruiting incentive will be eligible for a subsequent retention stipend only if the program continues beyond the duration of the employee's incentive schedule. There will be no recruiting stipend for LPN's entering the designated units. December 6, 1989</field>
