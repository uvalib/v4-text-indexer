      <field name="fulltext">WAGENHEIM MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP FUND At its meeting on December 11, 1965, the Board established a Scholarship Fund in memory of Michael Lewis Wagenheim, who at the time of his death was a fourth year student in the College of Arts and Sciences. The scholarship was established through the efforts of the student's father, Mr. Jack I. Wagenheim, and his uncle, Mr. Michael B. Wagenheim, both of whom are alumni of the University of Virginia. Subsequently Mr. Jack I. Wagenheim died, and at the request of Mr. Michael B. Wagenheim, the Board adopted a resolution on June 3, 1966 changing the name of the scholarship to the Wagenheim Memorial Scholarship Fund in order that gifts to the fund might be for the purpose of memorializing both the father and the son. On August 8, 1972, Mr. Michael B. Wagenheim died, and left in his Will a request that one-fourth of his residual estate be added to the fund, and that the Scholarship Fund be designated as being in memory of himself as well as the father and son. The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Michael Lewis Wagenheim Scholarship Fund established on December 11, 1965, and renamed as the Wagenheim Memorial Scholarship on June 3, 1966, be and it is hereby designated to memorialize a devoted student, Mr. Michael Lewis Wagenheim, and also Jack I. Wagenheim, and Mr. Michael B. Wagenheim who were dedicated alumni of the University.</field>

He advised that Mr. Walter Chaffin, a University Security Officer, was permitted to enroll as a student at Virginia Commonwealth University to study courses in Law Enforcement. The University agreed to pay his expenses. The estimated cost to the University will be $15,000. Mr. Robert Buford pointed out that in the Chaffin suit, each member of the Board was named a defendant. Mr. Buford objected to the arrangement of a settlement prior to discussion with the named defendant. He urged that in all future litigation, no settlement should be agreed to by the University without consulting the individual defendants.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">REPORT ON SECURITY In response to a question by Mr. Warren B. French, Jr., the President reported on the major effort of the University to provide greater security for the University. Mr. Alford noted a change in the practices of the security force in the direction of using diplomacy as a first approach to security problems. The President pointed out that the University is working closely with the City and County officials to improve security. Also, some $45,000 has been spent for lighting of the University Grounds. Seven additional positions have been provided for the Department of Security in order to strengthen the department.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT Mr. Edwin Crawford discussed proposed legislation which will come before the General Assembly which will remove Boards of Visitors from the list of organizations exempt from the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. Mr. Crawford expressed the view that the measure is likely to be enacted. There was expression from Board members that committee meetings ought not to be open so that Board members can refine proposed resolutions and discuss them informally before presentation to a full Board meeting. Mr. Lawrence Lewis expressed the view that there is considerable merit in public meetings, and stated that he was not opposed to them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REPORT ON THE THOMPSON BILL Mr. Alford reported on a bill that is scheduled to come before the General Assembly at its forthcoming session which if adopted would authorize the unionization of state employees. He advised that the faculty at the University has shown no interest in the measure. He predicts that the bill has a good chance for approval by the General Assembly.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">REPORTS BY STANDING COMMITTEES A letter from Mr. Corbette King addressed to the President enclosing a resolution made by the Board of Trustees of the Student Aid Foundation was read to the Board. The resolution requested responses about the athletic programs of the University. It was agreed that in order for the matter to be given full and careful consideration, it will be discussed at the February meeting. Both the President and the Rector will write to Mr. King in the meantime. The matter was referred to the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee for further study and for recommendations. Mr. Wright Harrison advised the Board that the Student Council had approved a grant of $45.00 to the Gay Student Union, and that the award had been protested by students. It appears that the question of making the award will be taken to court. In the discussion that followed, it was pointed out that the Board's guide lines for the distribution of money from Student Activities Funds must be clearly stated if they are to withstand court tests. Mr. Potter moved that for 1973-74, the allocation of funds from student activities fees should be made by a committee of three students (the President of the Raven Society, the President of ODK, and the President of the College) and six non-administrative faculty members appointed by the President. The motion failed, in favor of a motion to appoint a committee to study the procedure and standards for distribution of Student Activities Funds, and to report to the Board at the February meeting. This motion was adopted. The Rector appointed Mr. Wright Harrison, Mr. Donald Santarelli, and Mr. J. Harvie Wilkinson to serve on the committee. President Shannon urged that student input be sought. He expressed appreciation for the earnest effort of the students to reach a fair solution to the problems posed by the allocation. Mr. Wright Harrison then presented a request from the President and Vice-President of the Student Council that the Council President and Vice-President be invited to attend the full meetings of the Board of Visitors. In the discussion that followed, it was noted that the legislature may soon open all meetings of Boards of Visitors to the public. In view of this, and for reasons set forth in 1968 by a special committee appointed by the President to study the problem, it was decided that the Student Council representatives will continue their participation in meetings of the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee, but that the request to attend full Board meetings is to be denied, and that the Board will continue its present policy with respect to its meetings. It was further agreed that the Rector will write to Mr. James Rinaca to explain this position. In the discussion it was made clear that the Board appreciates the counsel given by students at the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee meetings. Mr. William S. Potter, Chairman of the Finance Committee, reported that the Committee had approved the Athletic Financial Report. He also reported that a decision has been reached to sell the timber at Seward Forest, and to retain the land and see that it is reforested. This action is subject to approval by the Governor. Dr. Hartwell Harrison, Chairman of the Medical Committee, reported that the Medical Center has an interest in acquiring the Towers Continuing Care Center. Upon recommendation of the Finance Committee, the Board approved a motion to have the Continuing Care Center appraised, and to authorize negotiations for the purchase of the property. Mr. W. Wright Harrison abstained from voting on the motion. Mr. C. Waller Barrett, Chairman of the Educational Policy Committee, reviewed discussions of proposed legislation that would bring about closer coordination of state institutions of higher education. He expressed the view that it is not now likely that a "superboard" will be formed to govern the Virginia state institutions. The President, who opposes the superboard concept, warned that a superboard proposal might still be considered by the General Assembly at the forthcoming session.</field>
