DEAN OF ENGINEERING The Board adopted the following resolution: RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the appointment of Professor Charles Henderson as Dean of the School of Engineering, which was made for two years beginning in September, 1951, be and it is hereby continued for another period of two years, effective in September, 1953. The President pointed out that he planned to appoint Mr. Lawrence Quarles Assistant Dean of the Engineering School, and that upon Mr. Henderson's retirement as Dean, two years hence when he reached the age of 65, he would propose the appointment of Mr. Quarles to succeed Dean Henderson. PROFESSOR JOHN L. FULMER President Darden made a brief report concerning the above member of the College Faculty. He stated that no action is required at this time and that the matter would probably come to the Board at a later date. ENDOWMENT FUNDS The Secretary was requested to make copies of a letter from the State Budget Director concerning the budgeting of all such funds, and send copies to the members of the Finance Committee. The Board requested the Finance Committee to study the matter and make recommendations to the Board. LAW ALUMNI At the last meeting of the Board, the President was requested to discuss with the representatives of the Law Alumni the question of whether they would support a general increase for the faculty at the next session of the Legislature. The President reported that he had talked with the Law Alumni representatives at some length. What they desired to do was to set a precedent with one member of the Law Faculty at $12,500. The President stated that in the budget which was being sent to the Finance Committee this weekend, he was proposing a total salary for Dean Ribble of $12,500. The Law Alumni agreed to join with the University in seeking an increase in the salary scale of the College, Engineering and Law Schools The President stated that he believed that through the Alumni sufficient money could be raised to attain the goal sought by the Law Alumni for the session 1953-54 ATHLETIC COMMITTEE In the absence of Mr. Talbott, Mr. Gay spoke for the Committee. He reported that he has been asked by Mr. Talbott to confer with Mr. Coleman Wortham, President of the Student Aid Foundation, concerning the proposal of the Student Aid Foundation that the grants-in-aid to athletes be made with the stipulation that funds will be taken away if a student does not maintain his academic standing and fails to participate in all sports in which he is asked to participate by the athletic officers of the University. Mr. Wortham informed Mr. Gay that to secure athletes in competition with other schools, it is necessary to make an offer of a four-year grant and that unless the above stipulation was obtained, a student could simply refuse to participate and there would be no way to take the grant away from him Mr. Black stated that some of the Student Aid officers felt that such a stipulation was not necessary. He objected to it on the grounds that (1) it was not necessary as only one student has ever refused to participate, and (2) if the Board permitted such a regulation in the University requirements, we would not be in conformity with the rules of the NCAA and, hence, would have to resign or be "kicked out". After considerable discussion, Mr. Gay was asked to confer with representatives of the Student Aid Foundation and secure in writing proposed regulations of the group, which the University would submit to the NCAA and secure a ruling as to whether or not such regulations would conform to the requirements of the NCAA. VINCENT ESTATE The Board adopted the following resolution granting a right-of-way to the Southern Natural Gas Company over property, a one-half interest in which is owned by the Succession of Hugh E. Vincent "WHEREAS, Trinity Church, the Administrators of Tulane Educational Fund and the University of Virginia are the three Naked Owners under the will of the late Hugh E. Vincent of the one-half interest of that estate in the property described in the following paragraphs, and WHEREAS, under date April ââ, 1953, the Succession of Hugh E.

Borah of New Orleans, Louisiana, as the representative of this institution, be and he hereby is authorized, empowered and directed to join the other two Naked Owners in signing the above described statement and agreement at the foot of said grant." MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE MATTERS RESIGNATION Miss Jane Grier Bell, Instructor in Physical Education, resigned to accept another position nearer her home PROMOTION The Board adopted the following resolution RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Miss Marion Chauncey, Assistant Professor of Music, be and she is hereby promoted to Associate Professor, effective September 1953, with a minimum salary of $4,200 for the academic year SALARY INCREASE The following resolution was adopted RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dr. Clifton McIntosh, Associate Professor of Spanish, be and he is hereby granted the $300 cost of living increase effective September, 1953. SPEECH CORRECTION PROGRAM President Darden reported that tentative plans had been made between the Dean of Mary Washington and the Faculty of the University to enable a few girls interested in taking work in speech correction to spend their fourth year in Charlottesville and to receive a degree from Mary Washington After considerable discussion of the proposal, the establishment of such a program was approved in principle, with the details left to be worked out by the respective schools. Mr. Gay stated that he thought the Act establishing Mary Washington as a liberal arts college and making it institutionally a part of the University contemplated that young women students would be educated at Fredericksburg and not at Charlottesville, and that in his opinion it was unwise to admit undergraduate females in the College at the University. He expressed himself as being strongly in favor of the preservation of the University as a school for men, and to put into effect the proposed proposal would be merely another step in the program of coordination, to which he was unalterably opposed -â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â- On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
