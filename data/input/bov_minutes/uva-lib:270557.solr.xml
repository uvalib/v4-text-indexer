The following Resolutions were offered by the Rector Mr. Alex: Rives and unanimously adopted- Resolved That in consideration of the privations endured and the sacrifices incurred by the Faculty in remaining at their posts during the late War - Maintaining the University in operation during its whole continuance and thus keeping it in position for immediate usefulness on the return of Peace, the Board of Visitors cannot withold their tribute of praise for this fidelity and constancy, in the part of the Professors, and the expression of their earnest hope that they will find their reward in the success and number of students of the next term. 2. That the Chairman through the medium of circulars and advertisements, reciting the past maintenance of the institution in spite of late adverse circumstances, and its thorough preparation at present with a full corps of Instructors to offer the same advantages of education as at any previous period of its most succesful career, solicite the aid and cooperation of its friends in filling its Halls, and thus restoring it to its former usefulness and prosperity.
