Dear Sir: I beg to report to your Board through you, that in June last the two committees of the Miller Board and the Board of Visitors of the University met at the Board of Visitors' House, and agreed that the status of the buildings on the grounds known as the "Mallet House", continue unchanged. Yours very truly, (signed) Armistead C. Gordon, Rector and Chairman Special Committee Board of Visitors.

Coxe be allowed to substitute an advanced course in Chemistry for Spanish in his application for the B. S. in Chemistry. 3. Resolved— That any student registered in the College prior to the present session may receive credit for Physical Training on the same basis as for Military Training; but that no such student shall receive credit for both. The following letter and report of the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings was read and ordered spread on the minutes: September 22, 1917. E. A. Alderman, Pres., University, Virginia. My dear Sir,- Concerning the increased cost of labor and mechanics 1. The drivers have been raised from 1.00 to 1.25 per day. 2. Fireman from $30.00 per month to $37.50. 3. Laborers from $1.25 per day to $1.37 1/2. 4. The carpenter, brick and plaster worker has quite because we could no compete. 5. The steam-fitter has been raised from $40.00 per month to $52.00. 6. All material-lime, cement, hardware, paint, horse feed, sand, stone, etc., has advanced an average of 25 percent during the last three months. I respectfully urge you to provide a truck for hauling at the University. I have estimated from $2,279. up to $3750. for 2-ton dumping truck. I recommend the one at $3750. which is a Packard or Pierce Arrow, but I will be glad to have the cheapest. Yours truly, (signed) W. A. Lambeth, Sup't. The report was approved and the recommendation relative to purchase of a truck was referred to the President with power to act. President Alderman read a letter from Mr. Lewis Cass Ledyard, one of the executors of the estate of Colonel Oliver Payne, claiming that the legacy of $ 200,000.00, to the University of Virginia, in the will of Colonel Payne, had been anticipated and settled by the payment to Dr. Alderman, of $250,000.00 as set out in the said letter, which letter reads as follows: Lewis Cass Ledyard 14 Wall Street New York September 5th, 1917. Dr. E. A. Alderman, President of the University of Virginia. My dear Sir: The Executors under the will of Colonel Payne are informed by Mr. Fuller that in or about the month of July, 1917, at the Colonel's country place at West Park, Colonel Payne told Mr. Fuller that in his will he had made a legacy of $250,000. to the University of Virginia, but that he had decided to give that sum presently, instead of waiting until death. Mr. Fuller further states that the next day Colonel Payne gave to you his check for $250,000. for the benefit of the University and said to you substantially what he had said to Mr. Fuller about the provision in his will and about his subsequent decision to make the gift presently. Colonel Payne was mistaken in his statement to Mr. Fuller as to the amount of the legacy which he had given to the University under his existing will, which was $200,000. and not $250,000. This was the will which was made by him in 1915 and which remained unchanged until his death. I have no doubt that you will corroborate the statements made as above by Mr. Fuller. Upon these statements I think it fair to say to you that the Executors are advised that by this transaction the legacy to the University was satisfied, and on their behalf I am writing to ask whether the University is not also of the same opinion, and if so whether it would be willing to file a renunciation of the legacy. The reason we are asking this question now is that if this payment by Colonel Payne to you and the accompanying statements operated as a satisfaction, it is necessary for us to have that fact established in the various transfer tax proceedings which we will have to institute in connection with his estate. Very truly yours, (signed) Lewis Cass Ledyard, Jr. Dr. Alderman also made a statement to the Board, setting out all he knew about and had done in connection with the case. Wereupon, the subject was discussed, and it was concluded that further consideration be deferred until a future meeting of the Board. President Alderman announced that through the beneficience of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a course in International Relations would be offered this session, to be conducted by Professor Lindsay Rogers, Adjunct Professor of Political Science. The $500. gift for the purpose to be distributed as follows: To Professor Lindsay Rogers, $300., to the assistant in Political Science, $125., and for the purchase of books for the Library necessary for the course, $75.

In addition to these new courses the Committee believes that the following existing courses in the University will prove both interesting and valuable for students contemplating Federal service. 1. INTERNATIONAL LAW AND DIPLOMACY. The nature, sources, development, and rules of international law (with a consideration of the problems of the European War), the causes of war, peace projects of the past, arbitral machinery, problems of the future, and the foregoing policy of the United States. —Adjunct Professor Rogers and Mr. Dingledine. 2. ENGINEERING GEOLOGY. A course of three lectures a week and three hours for private study. Special emphasis is given to the study of common rock-forming minerals and rocks, building stones and ores. The divisions of dynamical, structural and physiographical geology are covered in considerable detail, and the practical applications of the topics treated to engineering work are pointed out. (Fall, Winter, Spring Terms). —Professor Watson. 3. PLANE SURVEYING. —Fee $10.00 Lectures on the theory, uses and adjustments of the Compass level, Transit and Stadia, the Computations of Surveying; the methods and proper conduct of Farm, City, Topographic and Hydrographic surveys. Practical class exercises illustrating the subject matter of the lectures are assigned. With this lecture course goes a practical course in field surveys. Special emphasis will be laid on practical work in taking topography and contour mapping. This course comprises three lectures per week during the spring term and six hours per week in the field during the same term.—Professor Newcomb. 4. TOPOGRAPHICAL DRAWING. —Fee $ 3.50 In this course the conventional methods of making topographical maps are carefully taught. Each student is required to become reasonably proficient in the preparation of such maps. Particular attention is paid to the study of contour plans and the solution of problems based on them. (Spring term) —Professor Newcomb. 5. MILITARY SCIENCE AND TACTICS. Four hours of drill and one hour of lectures weekly throughout the entire session. — Colonel Cole.

      <field name="fulltext">Lewis Cass Ledyard 14 Wall Street New York September 5th, 1917. Dr. E. A. Alderman, President of the University of Virginia. My dear Sir: The Executors under the will of Colonel Payne are informed by Mr. Fuller that in or about the month of July, 1917, at the Colonel's country place at West Park, Colonel Payne told Mr. Fuller that in his will he had made a legacy of $250,000. to the University of Virginia, but that he had decided to give that sum presently, instead of waiting until death. Mr. Fuller further states that the next day Colonel Payne gave to you his check for $250,000. for the benefit of the University and said to you substantially what he had said to Mr. Fuller about the provision in his will and about his subsequent decision to make the gift presently. Colonel Payne was mistaken in his statement to Mr. Fuller as to the amount of the legacy which he had given to the University under his existing will, which was $200,000. and not $250,000. This was the will which was made by him in 1915 and which remained unchanged until his death. I have no doubt that you will corroborate the statements made as above by Mr. Fuller. Upon these statements I think it fair to say to you that the Executors are advised that by this transaction the legacy to the University was satisfied, and on their behalf I am writing to ask whether the University is not also of the same opinion, and if so whether it would be willing to file a renunciation of the legacy. The reason we are asking this question now is that if this payment by Colonel Payne to you and the accompanying statements operated as a satisfaction, it is necessary for us to have that fact established in the various transfer tax proceedings which we will have to institute in connection with his estate. Very truly yours, (signed) Lewis Cass Ledyard, Jr.</field>
