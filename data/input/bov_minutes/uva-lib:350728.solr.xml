HUGH E. VINCENT ESTATE President Darden presented the following Preamble and Resolutions to the Board- WHEREAS, Hugh E. Vincent, of the City of New Orleans, Louisiana, who attended the University of Virginia Law School from 1909 to 1912, died on April 12, 1951, leaving a will in which, after making a number of specific and pecuniary bequests, he leaves the entire residue of his estate to be administered by Whitney National Bank of New Orleans during the lifetime of his widow, Mrs. Mildred Saffold Vincent. At the death of the widow the remainder in said residue is left one-third to the University of Virginia, one-third to Tulane University, and one-third to Trinity Church in New Orleans. Under Louisiana law bequests to educational, charitable and religious organizations located outside of the State of Louisiana are not exempt from Louisiana Inheritance Tax. Furthermore, the tax laws of Louisiana require this tax to be paid within six months from date of decedent's death, and while the legacies to Tulane University and Trinity Church are exempt, the inheritance tax chargeable against the share of the University of Virginia in the residue of this estate has been tentatively calculated by the Civil District Court in and for the Parish of Orleans, Louisiana, at $47,384.33, which tentative calculation we are advised is subject to revision by the Tax Department; and, WHEREAS, this sum of money was not immediately available for the purpose of paying this tax, it was deemed wise by the Rector and Executive Committee of this Board to borrow said sum, or so much as might be necessary to pay said tax when the exact amount is fixed by the Tax Department of the State of Louisiana, and to this end application was made to the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund for said loan and said loan was approved by said Alumni Board of Trustees and the cash was made immediately available by said Alumni Board of Trustees, NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the action of the Rector and Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia in arranging to borrow from the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund the amount necessary for payment of the Louisiana State Inheritance Tax chargeable against the share of the University of Virginia in the residue of the estate of Hugh E. Vincent, be and the same is hereby approved, ratified and confirmed. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President, be and is hereby authorized and empowered to execute, on behalf of and in the name of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a negotiable note for the principal sum of the amount of said Inheritance Tax payable three years after date to the order of the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund, at First and Merchants National Bank of Richmond, Virginia, and bearing interest at the rate of 4% per annum payable semi-annually, said note to bear upon its face the following clause- "The right is hereby reserved by the maker hereof to anticipate the payment of this note on any date provided sixty days prior written notice of such anticipation is given to the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund." The above resolution was approved with the proviso that the President ascertain that the interests of the University are properly protected as to the corpus of the fund. REPORT ON AID TO ATHLETES President Darden presented to the Board the following report made by Mr. Tebell on aid given athletes at the University of Virginia. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF ATHLETICS AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA October 8, 1951 President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. University of Virginia Charlottesville, Virginia Dear President Darden: As per your request of October 2, I am setting forth a statement regarding the following: 1. RECRUITING â We have no definite or set plan in approaching prospective students for the University of Virginia football squad. Herewith is the usual procedure followed â a procedure which may vary somewhat in individual cases, but very little. Records are kept in the football office of good football prospects in the area â records which are obtained primarily through subscription to the larger newspapers of the state from which we retain clippings of the headline athletes. Also we encourage alumni and friends of the University to write us about good football players. With this information at hand, we invite some of the outstanding boys to come to Virginia as our guests for some sports contest; in this we are assisted by the V-Club members who act as hosts for the youngsters while they are here. After the football season is over, we check our list of prospects and begin to contact them and their parents. If we do not know the boys, we get an introduction through some alumnus or friend and we pay a visit to his home to determine whether or not, he, and his parents, are interested in the University, and whether we think he will fit into the University life. An effort is also made at this time to evaluate the economic status of the boy's parents and how much, if any, financial aid he will need to attend school. If he meets the above requirements, we then have a talk with his principal as to his character, and of course, his academic standing. If the above screening is favorable, and the boy has never been to Virginia, we invite him and his parents to visit us at which time we pay for the boy's lodging and meals â not the expenses of anyone accompanying him. If, after seeing the University, both parties are still interested, and the boy needs financial assistance, he applies for a grant-in-aid scholarship. His application is acted on only after he has been accepted by the Committee on Admissions and reviewed by the Committee for the Student Aid Foundation. We do not see the transcript as it is mailed directly from the school principal to the Dean of Admissions, who in turn, sends a copy of the record to the Foundation Scholarship Committee. The Foundation Committee passing on the grant-in-aid application includes Mr. Ritchie of the Law Faculty. If a scholarship is awarded, the recipient is then asked to sign a contract in which he promises 1) to stay scholastically eligible, 2) do nothing which will reflect discredit upon the University, 3) make an honest and conscientious effort to help the team. We, in turn, help him financially. An up-to-date record of the grant-in-aid awards are attached, together with a scholarship application. 2. ADMISSION OF ATHLETES â Any and all athletes are admitted to the University under the same conditions and in the same way as any other student 3. CONTROL OF ATHLETES UNDER SCHOLARSHIPS OR OTHERWISE â Any athlete may eat or live wherever he wishes unless otherwise regulated by the University, the only exception being that he must abide by certain training rules. Hoping that the above information covers everything as per your request, I am Respectfully yours, Gus K. Tebell Director of Athletics September 25, 1951 Listed below are the number of students receiving aid through the Virginia Student Aid Foundation and the Virginia Alumni Scholarship Committee. 21 Out-of-State students receive $1,250 each. Broken down into classes. 5 - Fourth Year Students $ 6,250.00 5 - Third Year Students 6,250.00 5 - Second Year Students 6,250.00 6 - First Year Students 7,500.00 14 State students receive $950 each. Broken down into classes: 4 - Third Year Students 3,800.00 4 - Second Year Students 3,800.00 6 - First Year Students 5,700.00 1 State student receives 700.00 1 State student receives 400.00 1 State student receives 200.00 1 Out-of-State student receives 200.00 Total $41,050.00 Listed below is the grant-in-aid received by the students in the following sports: Boxing 1 student receives $675. 1 student receives $635. 1 student receives $550. Basketball 3 State students receive tuition and room, totaling $1,032. 1 Out-of-State student receives tuition and room, totaling $634. 3 Out-of-State students receive tuition only, totaling $1,527. 2 State students receive tuition only, totaling $418. Baseball 2 State students receive tuition, totaling $418. Swimming 3 students get free rooms, totaling $375 President Darden pointed out that in the session 1949-50 approximately $32,000 had been spent by the Student Aid Foundation for athletic scholarships and for the present session this had increased to $47,000. Mr. Darden stated that he was disturbed at the size of the increase and also the number of boys brought in from outside the State to play football. Of the 29 receiving aid, 22 are non-residents. Mr. Gay inquired if the students were asked to sign any statement certifying that they are receiving only the amounts stated in Mr. Tebell's report. The President replied that they were not, but the whole matter was strictly supervised by Captain Pritchett and is now supervised by Mr. Tebell. PROGRAM FOR HISTORY 17-18 The President read the following letter from Professor Snavely. September 20, 1951 President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. University of Virginia Charlottesville, Virginia Dear President Darden: Your letter of September 15th has been received and was considered at a meeting of the faculty of the School of Economics held on September 19th. The ten voting members of the faculty were all present. The following resolutions were passed: "1.

Snavely Chairman, School of Economics and Business Administration STATE BAR EXAMINATION President Darden read the following letter from Professor Ribble, Dean of the Department of Law. 26 September 1951 Dear Mr. Darden: One hundred and twelve students who have studied in this law school took the Virginia Bar Examination. Of this number, sixteen (14.3%) passed. Of the students taking the examination, thirty-nine are graduates, of whom five passed. I do not gather that you want me to discuss this very serious situation. I feel, however, that a brief statement might be made. As I understand it, the Virginia Bar Examination is strictly on Virginia law. If there is a case in Virginia, whether the Virginia view be a minority view in the United States or not, that case gives the answer to the question. In addition, the bar examination is directed to certain important courses, but completely omits many courses which form an essential part of law school training, as, for example, Federal Taxation, Labor Law, etc. If it were desired to maintain a school with a high record on the Virginia Bar Examination, most of our elective subjects would be dropped, and the whole method, which is universal in the better law schools in the United States of considering cases from all American jurisdictions, would be scrapped. Concentrated drive would be put on Virginia Decisions and Virginia Statutes. I would suggest that such a law school, even if its students were trained only for Virginia, would tend to develop an inbred and a narrow bar, which would not be in accord with the traditions of this Commonwealth and which would but poorly serve its needs. An examination of the results of the bar examinations show a record of irrational irregularity. I attach hereto the percentages for the past few years. You will note, for example, that in the December 1950 examination the percentage passing was three and one-half times as great as that in the examination given six months later. It seems to me such figures reflect grave discredit on the examination. They cannot be explained by any variation in the quality of the applicants or in the quality of their education. Through the years, the percentage of successful applicants from this school has with but very few exceptions been above the general average and has been fairly constant with those of Washington and Lee, for example. I have written to Stuart Campbell, the Chairman of the Board, expressing my opinion of the results. Sincerely, (s) F. D. G. Ribble President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. University of Virginia Notation by hand: Today I received a report of the June Bar exam in New York to effect that nine Va. graduates took the exam, seven of whom passed. That exam is by reputation very difficult. Successful Virginia Bar Applicants Date of Examination No. Taking Exam.

The Board approved the recommendation of the Committee and the house was assigned to Dr. Chanutin. RICHMOND PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTE Mr. Howard stated that he felt R.P.I. was hanging in the balance at the present time, because of the difficulties at William and Mary. He believes that if the University plans to take over, action should be taken soon. President Darden stated that with the resignation of Dr. Pomfret he felt it proper to wait until the new president took office, as he might wish to continue the operation of R.P.I. RESOLUTION ON RICHEY PETITION Mr. Gravatt, as Chairman of a committee composed of himself, Mrs. Wailes and Mr. Mears, presented a report, whereupon the following resolution was adopted.
