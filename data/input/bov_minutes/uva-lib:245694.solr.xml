Resolved that the house situated at the south end of East Range now occupied by Professor F. P. Dunnington be placed in the hands of the Proctor for rent, upon the condition that it be rented to some official of the University of Virginia, provided that none of the Professors wish to occupy it. On motion the Board adjourned to meet at 9 A. M. tomorrow. W. C. N. Randolph Rector Jas D. Jones, Secretary. University of Va. April 25th 1890 The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday. Present, the same members as on yesterday with the exception of Mr Patteson, who was called away by other engagements. On motion, the question of salaries to assistant professors was referred to the Committee on the Conduct of Schools for its consideration and report thereon to the annual meeting of the Board. On motion Section 6 of the Faculty's report in relation to Dormitories etc. was referred to the Committee on Grounds, Buildings etc. for report thereon to the annual meeting. Upon the recommendation in Section 7 of the Faculty's report, On motion, resolved that additional service for the medical and Biological Hall be provided at an expense not to exceed $15. per month for nine months. On motion, resolved that five hundred dollars be added to the usual appropriation of four hundred and fifty dollars for the use of the Library, and that the additional appropriation be expended in books, it being the sense of the Board that the Librarian should complete the Catalogue without additional compensation. On motion Section 10 of the Faculty's report in relation to the water supply was referred to the Committee on Grounds, Buildings etc. for consideration and report to the annual meeting in June. On motion Section 12 of the same report in relation to letter boxes for students referred to Committee on Grounds, Buildings etc. for consideration &amp; report to the annual meeting in June. On motion, resolved, that the recommendations contained in "Annex A" accompanying the report of the Faculty be concurred in— This paper reads as follows The Faculty respectfully suggest the following optional first year-course for Medical students. To induce a greater number of young men to return here after the first year they believe it will be necessary to make a change, even though it be an optional one, in the usual method of dividing the course into a first and second year— Wishing likewise to utilize as far as possible the instruction and equipment of those schools which can contribute as collateral branches to medical education, we suggest that the proposed course consist of the following. Anat. &amp; Mat. Med. (The regular course as it now stands); Chemistry, (The regular course unchanged); Biology, (Slightly modified to suit medical students); Physics, (Special course for medical students) We suggest that the charges for Medical students in the above schools shall be as follows: Anat. Mat. &amp; Med. (as at present) $35.00 Chemistry, (as at present) 25.00 Biology, to Med. students not taking Botany etc. Tuition $15 Material 10. 25.00 Physics (special course) 10.00 It is likewise suggested that the school of Anatomy be placed upon the same footing as the School of Chemistry in that those who obtain a proficiency will not be required to attend lectures during the coming session. The Board received the communication of Adjunct Professor Dabney in relation to the establishment of a class in English and American History, and being favorably inclined to the suggestions therein contained, it is resolved that the matter be remitted to Profr Dabney with the request that he have the same considered by the Faculty and reported to the Board through the regular channel. Resolved that, 1.st After maturely considering the question of whether to enlarge the Chemical Hall or to divide the class and grant the Professor an Assistant, the Board of Visitors decide it best for the present to let the hall remain as it is and grant the required assistant at a salary of $800. Resolved 2nd That the question of building a small extension for the use of Profr Dunnington and of lighting the building be referred to the Committee on Grounds &amp; Buildings. Resolved that, the communication of D. H. Howard be referred to the Faculty and that authority be conferred on the Faculty if they consider the case of Mr Howard one of peculiar merit, to grant him the credit asked upon his executing to the Proctor a bond for Thirty three 90/100 dollars with good security. This action is taken because Mr Howard is near the close of his second session at the University and is not to be regarded as a precedent. Resolved, that Profr Thornton be authorized to advertise to the public the enlargement of the plant of the present Engineering School, and the addition of courses in Sanitary &amp; Electrical Engineering, provided that, after conference with Profr Tuttle, Profr of Biology, &amp; Profr Smith, Profr of Natural Philosophy, it be found practicable for them to assume charge respectively of these additional courses. Messrs Randolph and Kean were elected members of the Executive Committee to fill the two vacancies in the Committee. On motion the Board adjourned sine die. Jas D. Jones, Secretary. W. C. N.

On motion Section 12 of the same report in relation to letter boxes for students referred to Committee on Grounds, Buildings etc. for consideration &amp; report to the annual meeting in June. On motion, resolved, that the recommendations contained in "Annex A" accompanying the report of the Faculty be concurred in— This paper reads as follows The Faculty respectfully suggest the following optional first year-course for Medical students. To induce a greater number of young men to return here after the first year they believe it will be necessary to make a change, even though it be an optional one, in the usual method of dividing the course into a first and second year— Wishing likewise to utilize as far as possible the instruction and equipment of those schools which can contribute as collateral branches to medical education, we suggest that the proposed course consist of the following. Anat. &amp; Mat. Med. (The regular course as it now stands); Chemistry, (The regular course unchanged); Biology, (Slightly modified to suit medical students); Physics, (Special course for medical students) We suggest that the charges for Medical students in the above schools shall be as follows: Anat. Mat. &amp; Med. (as at present) $35.00 Chemistry, (as at present) 25.00 Biology, to Med. students not taking Botany etc. Tuition $15 Material 10. 25.00 Physics (special course) 10.00 It is likewise suggested that the school of Anatomy be placed upon the same footing as the School of Chemistry in that those who obtain a proficiency will not be required to attend lectures during the coming session. The Board received the communication of Adjunct Professor Dabney in relation to the establishment of a class in English and American History, and being favorably inclined to the suggestions therein contained, it is resolved that the matter be remitted to Profr Dabney with the request that he have the same considered by the Faculty and reported to the Board through the regular channel. Resolved that, 1.st After maturely considering the question of whether to enlarge the Chemical Hall or to divide the class and grant the Professor an Assistant, the Board of Visitors decide it best for the present to let the hall remain as it is and grant the required assistant at a salary of $800. Resolved 2nd That the question of building a small extension for the use of Profr Dunnington and of lighting the building be referred to the Committee on Grounds &amp; Buildings. Resolved that, the communication of D. H. Howard be referred to the Faculty and that authority be conferred on the Faculty if they consider the case of Mr Howard one of peculiar merit, to grant him the credit asked upon his executing to the Proctor a bond for Thirty three 90/100 dollars with good security. This action is taken because Mr Howard is near the close of his second session at the University and is not to be regarded as a precedent. Resolved, that Profr Thornton be authorized to advertise to the public the enlargement of the plant of the present Engineering School, and the addition of courses in Sanitary &amp; Electrical Engineering, provided that, after conference with Profr Tuttle, Profr of Biology, &amp; Profr Smith, Profr of Natural Philosophy, it be found practicable for them to assume charge respectively of these additional courses.
