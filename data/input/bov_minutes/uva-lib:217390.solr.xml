      <field name="fulltext">A meeting of the Rector &amp; Visitors of the University of Virginia was held at the University on the 6th.. Octr. 1823, at which were present Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Breckenridge, John H. Cocke, George Loyall, and Joseph C. Cabell. Resolved that the board approves of the contract entered into with Giacomo Raggi for furnishing bases of marble of Carrare for the columns of the Rotunda. Resolved that they recommend to the executive committee to procure capitals of the same marble for the same columns if practicable on terms not higher than those offered by Thos. Appleton. Resolved that they recommend also to the said committee to procure squares of marble for paving the Portico of the Rotunda if they find that it can be done on terms preferable to what it will cost to have the same paved with country stone. Resolved, that it be an instruction to the collector of the University to call once more on the subscribers who are in arrear for the payment of their arrears, that from those not ready to make payment he may receive instead thereof bonds or notes from those who have not already given them payable in ninety days, &amp; if these be not given that he institute suits in the proper court with instructions to the attorney engaged to press the suits to execution with the least delay practicable. Resolved that the board think it expedient to continue the collector so long as the executive committee may deem his employment necessary to finish the collection. A Report to the President &amp; Directors of the Literary Fund having been proposed was agreed to. TH: JEFFERSON Oct. 6. 1823. To the President and Directors of the Literary fund. In obedience to the law requiring that the Rector &amp; Visitors of the University of Virginia should make Report annually to the President and Directors of the Literary fund (to be laid before the legislature at their next succeeding session) embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of the said University, the sd Rector &amp; Visitors make the following Report. In conformity with the act of the General assembly of Feb. 5. of the present year, requiring that, out of the uninvested capital then lying in the Literary fund, there should be loaned, by the President &amp; Directors of the sd fund, to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, for the purpose of completing the buildings, and making the necessary preparations for putting the sd University into operation, any sum required by the said Rector and Visitors, not exceeding that of 60,000. Dollars, the Visitors at their meeting on the 7th. of April last, deemed it necessary for the institution to require the whole of the sd sum, but that it should be drawn in different portions and at different times, as it should be wanting, so far as the Literary board should think admissible. there was accordingly recieved by an order of the sd board in the month of May last a sum of forty thousand Dollars ___ .. ___ .. ___ .. ___ in consequence hereof the larger building, for a Library and other purposes was commenced, &amp; has been carried on with activity, insomuch that it's walls are now ready to recieve their roof; but that being of hemispherical form, &amp; pressing outwardly in every direction, it has been thought not advisable to place it on the walls, in their present green state; but rather to give them time to settle and dry until the ensuing season, when the roof will be ready, &amp; the walls in a proper condition to recieve it. whether the interior work of the building will be finished, within the ensuing year, is doubtful. The Report of the 7th. of October of the last year stated that the buildings for the accomodation of the Professors and Students were in readiness for occupation except as to some small articles of plaistering then on hand, the garden walls and grounds, and some columns which awaited their Capitels from abroad. these buildings are done, the Capitels are recieved and put up; and the whole of these buildings are now in perfect readiness for putting the institution into operation. and this might be done (taking reasonable time for procuring Professors) at the close of the ensuing year 1824, were it's funds liberated from their present incumbrances. but these remove the epoch to a very distant time. the several sums advanced from the Literary fund, as loans, when the balance of the last shall have been recieved, will amount to 180,000. Dollars, bearing a present interest of 10,800.D. this, with the cost of the necessary care and preservation of the establishment will leave, of the annual endowment of the University a surplus of between two and three thousand Dollars only, with it's compound increase for the redemption of the principal. this being, as before-mentioned, of 180,000.D. will be extinguished by the annual payment of a constant sum of 2,500.D. at the end of 25. years, a term too distant for the education of any person already born, or to be born, for some time to come; and within that period a great expence will be incurred in the mere preservation of the buildings &amp; appurtenances. these are views which it is the duty of the Visitors to present, and to leave, to the wisdom and paternal consideration of the legislature, to whose care are confided the instruction, and other interests of the present, as well as of the future generations proceeding from us. That Report, with the letter of the 23d. accompanying it, stated also that the buildings of accomodation for the Professors and Students were so far paid for as that the arrearages of subscriptions still due, being 18,343.43½ would, when recieved, compleat their payment to within the sum of 8,658.19½. while there were other funds to which present recourse could be had, it had been deemed reasonable to indulge the convenience of such subscribers as found difficulties in paying their instalments rigorously at the periods prescribed. but that these arrears having then become urgently necessary, an active collector had been employed to settle and call for them, in the course of the year he has collected, of these arrearages, the sum of 4,826.77½ he has obtained bonds, or promises, verbal or written, for prompt payment, deemed good, to the amount of 10,107.93-3/4; and as to the remainder, some of the subscribers have not yet been called on, some have removed out of the state, and some become insolvent. Of this remainder, he considers 932.25 as sperate, and the residue, between 2,500. and 2,600.D. as desperate; which on 43,808.D. the whole sum subscribed, will be an ultimate loss of nearly 6. per cent. this will so far increase the deficit of 8,658.19½ before stated as falling short of paying for the four rows of buildings, and so far add to the charge on the funds on hand or still to accrue. this state of things obliges a call for peremptory and prompt payment of these arrearages, which cannot be thought unreasonable by the subscribers who have been so far indulged already, when it is considered that these works were engaged on the faith of the sums subscribed, so far as their amount, that those who undertook them have accordingly executed them, and are now justly entitled to the compensation stipulated. we trust therefore that, in the course of the ensuing twelve months, these arrearages will be paid up, except such as intervening circumstances may have rendered desperate. A general statement of the Reciepts and Expenditures, from all funds &amp; for all purposes, from the beginning of the establishment to the 1st. of October of the last year, was communicated for the legislature, at their last session. those of the Bursar and Proctor, for the year ending the 1st. day of this present October are herewith rendered. they have been duly settled, and tested by their vouchers, by the same Accountant, and Committee, employed on the former occasion, and will be duly submitted by those officers, for Audit by the Accountant of the Literary board. TH: JEFFERSON October 6. 1823. Sir Monticello. December 23. 1822 According to the requisitions of the law, I now transmit to the President and Directors of the Literary fund, for communication to the legislature, the annual Report of the Visitors of the University of Virginia, bearing date the 7th. of October last. at that date the regular books were not yet compleated which were under preparation for the purpose of exhibiting a clear and methodical view of the application of all the monies which have been received and employed on this institution. from the best view which, before that time, had been taken of the affairs of the University it was expected, as is stated in this Report, that the buildings now prepared would be compleatly paid for by the subscriptions still due. these books have been since compleated, and the result (as appears by the certificates herewith inclosed) is that the institution has received from the beginning to the 23d. of the last month, in the whole, &amp; from all funds, the sum of 199,159.98½ and is still to receive of subscriptions unpaid 18,343.43½ 217,503.42 and there has been paid, within the same period for the purposes of the institution the same sum of 199,159.98½ and there remains to be paid of debts settled &amp; unsettled about 27,001.63 226,161.61½ being more than the arrearages of subscription will pay by 8,658.19½ which sum must therefore necessarily come from the annuity of the ensuing year. some finishings, of small amount, to the garden walls &amp; pavements also are still wanting, and there will be some loss of subscriptions by bankruptcies and removals, though not considerable in proportion to the whole sum subscribed. a Collector, employed some time since, gives reason to believe that the arrearages which are sperate will be generally paid up in the course of the ensuing spring. The accounts of the Bursar and Proctors have been examined, from the beginning to the same date of November 23. by a member of the board of Visitors, appointed a Committee for that purpose, have been tested by their vouchers, and the result certified in the books by the Committee, as is shewn by the certificates, copies of which accompany this Report. from these it will appear that, in a course of so great expenditure, every article (a single one excepted of 75. cents only) has been satisfactorily vouched as faithfully applied to the purposes of the institution, with the sanction of the Visitors. the Bursar and Proctor will proceed without delay, with their accounts and vouchers, to settle with the public accountant the trust which they have so far and so correctly executed. The Proctor's last semi-annual account, not ready at the date of the Report, is now transmitted. An estimate made by the Proctor at an early period, supposed that the last building called for by the Report of 1818. and not yet executed, would probably cost the sum of 46,847.D. but this did not include two considerable appendages necessary to connect it with the other buildings. an estimate, including these, now recently made by the principal undertakers and executors of the other buildings raise it's amount to about one third more. It is by instruction from the Visitors that I communicate facts which resulting from investigations not concluded at the date of their Report, and consequently not known to them, constitute an important supplement to the matter of their report; to which I add the assurance of my high consideration.

Of this remainder, he considers 932.25 as sperate, and the residue, between 2,500. and 2,600.D. as desperate; which on 43,808.D. the whole sum subscribed, will be an ultimate loss of nearly 6. per cent. this will so far increase the deficit of 8,658.19½ before stated as falling short of paying for the four rows of buildings, and so far add to the charge on the funds on hand or still to accrue. this state of things obliges a call for peremptory and prompt payment of these arrearages, which cannot be thought unreasonable by the subscribers who have been so far indulged already, when it is considered that these works were engaged on the faith of the sums subscribed, so far as their amount, that those who undertook them have accordingly executed them, and are now justly entitled to the compensation stipulated. we trust therefore that, in the course of the ensuing twelve months, these arrearages will be paid up, except such as intervening circumstances may have rendered desperate. A general statement of the Reciepts and Expenditures, from all funds &amp; for all purposes, from the beginning of the establishment to the 1st. of October of the last year, was communicated for the legislature, at their last session. those of the Bursar and Proctor, for the year ending the 1st. day of this present October are herewith rendered. they have been duly settled, and tested by their vouchers, by the same Accountant, and Committee, employed on the former occasion, and will be duly submitted by those officers, for Audit by the Accountant of the Literary board.

      <field name="fulltext">Sir Monticello. December 23. 1822 According to the requisitions of the law, I now transmit to the President and Directors of the Literary fund, for communication to the legislature, the annual Report of the Visitors of the University of Virginia, bearing date the 7th. of October last. at that date the regular books were not yet compleated which were under preparation for the purpose of exhibiting a clear and methodical view of the application of all the monies which have been received and employed on this institution. from the best view which, before that time, had been taken of the affairs of the University it was expected, as is stated in this Report, that the buildings now prepared would be compleatly paid for by the subscriptions still due. these books have been since compleated, and the result (as appears by the certificates herewith inclosed) is that the institution has received from the beginning to the 23d. of the last month, in the whole, &amp; from all funds, the sum of 199,159.98½ and is still to receive of subscriptions unpaid 18,343.43½ 217,503.42 and there has been paid, within the same period for the purposes of the institution the same sum of 199,159.98½ and there remains to be paid of debts settled &amp; unsettled about 27,001.63 226,161.61½ being more than the arrearages of subscription will pay by 8,658.19½ which sum must therefore necessarily come from the annuity of the ensuing year. some finishings, of small amount, to the garden walls &amp; pavements also are still wanting, and there will be some loss of subscriptions by bankruptcies and removals, though not considerable in proportion to the whole sum subscribed. a Collector, employed some time since, gives reason to believe that the arrearages which are sperate will be generally paid up in the course of the ensuing spring. The accounts of the Bursar and Proctors have been examined, from the beginning to the same date of November 23. by a member of the board of Visitors, appointed a Committee for that purpose, have been tested by their vouchers, and the result certified in the books by the Committee, as is shewn by the certificates, copies of which accompany this Report. from these it will appear that, in a course of so great expenditure, every article (a single one excepted of 75. cents only) has been satisfactorily vouched as faithfully applied to the purposes of the institution, with the sanction of the Visitors. the Bursar and Proctor will proceed without delay, with their accounts and vouchers, to settle with the public accountant the trust which they have so far and so correctly executed. The Proctor's last semi-annual account, not ready at the date of the Report, is now transmitted. An estimate made by the Proctor at an early period, supposed that the last building called for by the Report of 1818. and not yet executed, would probably cost the sum of 46,847.D. but this did not include two considerable appendages necessary to connect it with the other buildings. an estimate, including these, now recently made by the principal undertakers and executors of the other buildings raise it's amount to about one third more. It is by instruction from the Visitors that I communicate facts which resulting from investigations not concluded at the date of their Report, and consequently not known to them, constitute an important supplement to the matter of their report; to which I add the assurance of my high consideration.
