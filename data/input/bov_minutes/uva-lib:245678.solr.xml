When the Committee was enlarged by the appointment of Colo Barbee, they again viewed the said grounds in company with Revd Mr. Glazebrook, Chaplain, and they have fixed on the site north of the Garth boarding-house, and near the pond in the lawn, as the most suitable and acceptable location on which to erect said Chapel. They are advised that this site is preferred by a large majority of those most deeply interested as the one most agreeable to the citizens, students and Faculty. It is of easy access to all, and with ordinary care can be built without injury to any of the University property. Your Committee, however, earnestly recommend that a watchful supervision to this end should be observed by the Chairman of the Faculty, the Proctor and the authorities of the University generally.

The following report was adopted: "The Committee on Grounds and Buildings, to which was referred that part of the Faculty Report, releting to the condition of the walls and roofs of the Chapel and the reading-room, beg leave to report that on examination of said structures, they find the same in very bad condition especially as to the roofs and walls. But in consequence of the low condition of our funds at this time, Your Committee feel constrained to be satisfied with the simple recommendation that the roof of both buildings be repaired with new shingles, that rops and braces be placed against the walls of both if required; and that such other cheap repairs, as are necessary, be promptly done under the superintendence of the proctor. Your Committee further recommends that the cost of these repairs be defrayed out of the appropriations for repairs and improvements the current year. Respy Submitted, John W. Bell W. R.

But in no case shall students be permitted to board in any hotel in Charlottesville, o in any house unlicensed by the Faculty: That the present at the University be rented but by the Executive Committee, That each student may provide his own furniture and employ his own servant, and may board where he prefers, and at what price he may agree upon: That the business of the University shall extend only to the assignment to the Student of his room, and to such general supervision of the boarding-houses as is implied in licensing them. We further recommend that all persons who shall board any student or students occupying the dormitories of the University shall pay the following sum to wit: fifty-five and a half cents, per student, per month, and that the dormitories heretofore assigned to students in the mess and hotels be left to stand as they are, but the students may at the end of any month change their place of boarding without changing their rooms.
