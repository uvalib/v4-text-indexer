      <field name="fulltext">UNIVERSITY POLICY ON CAMPAIGNING FOR AND SERVING IN AN ELECTED PUBLIC OFFICE The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following statement of University policy on campaigning for and serving in an elected public office be and it is hereby approved: POLICY ON CAMPAIGNING FOR AND SERVING IN AN ELECTED PUBLIC OFFICE FACULTY Members of the faculty are in no way precluded by their relationship with the University from normal political activities but while they are in full-time status, it is understood that the activities related to their academic appointments will have first claim on their time and energy. It should at all times be made clear that political positions assumed by members of the faculty are personal, and do not necessarily, or even inferentially, reflect any position taken by the University of Virginia. Members of the faculty may from time to time be invited to perform public service in an appointive capacity, at the national state, or local level. The University encourages them to render this type of service, believing that it is in its own interest that they should do so. It shall be the responsibility of the individual's Dean and of the Provost to determine whether the performance of this service will make sufficient demands on his time and energy to require a modification of his duty status, and, if some form of leave of absence is indicated, to determine whether any portion of this leave should be with pay. Leave will ordinarily be taken if the individual's outside activities may reasonably be expected to require either more of his time than would customarily be allowed for consulting activity or protracted absences from Charlottesville. The Attorney General ruled in 1971 that faculty members do not hold office under the government of the Commonwealth. The Constitution of Virginia, however, in Article IV, section 4, sets a standard: No person holding a salaried office under the government of the Commonwealth, and no judge of any court, attorney for the Commonwealth, sheriff, treasurer, assessor of taxes, commissioner of the revenue, collector of taxes, or clerk of any court shall be a member of either house of the General Assembly during his continuance in office; and his qualification as a member shall vacate any such office held by him. which may be useful as a guide for faculty and staff in considering the level of permissible participation in public affairs. The current provision of the Constitution is carried over from the earlier constitutional provision and was the subject of serious and informed consideration by the Commission on Constitutional Revision, which consisted of distinguished public officials and educators. The problems of interpretation are manifold; interested persons are referred to pages 128-130 of the summary of the deliberations of the Commission on Constitutional Revision, and to pages 479-485 of Mr. A. E. Dick Howard's treatise on the 1971 Constitution of Virginia. Still, the constitutional rule amplified by these discussions represents the best available statement of the principles which should guide both the administration and the faculty and staff members in determining, in individual cases, the proper level of participation in public affairs. Faculty members who choose to become candidates for elective public office on the state or national level will be expected to take leave of absence without pay for the period of their campaigns, in both primary and general elections. If elected, they will be expected to take leave of absence without pay for any semester during which the performance of their duties will require them to be absent from Charlottesville for substantial periods. If the duties or activities associated with his office can be performed in Charlottesville, but may reasonably be expected to require more of his time than is customarily allowed for consulting Activities, a faculty member must assume part-time status at the University, at a level to be determined by his Dean and the Provost of the University. In contrast with candidacy for state and national offices, candidacy for local offices, such as membership on a City Council or a County Board of Supervisors, is ordinarily less time consuming, as is service on either of these bodies. If campaigning and service time can be limited to what would customarily be allowed for consulting activity, the faculty member may remain in full-time status with the University. If his political activities require more of his time than that, it shall be the responsibility of his Dean and of the Provost to determine whether he should be required to take leave of absence or to accept a reduced teaching and/or research load, with corresponding adjustment in the level of his compensation. A faculty member who receives a salary supplement for the performance of administrative duties must take leave of absence from his administrative position during any election campaign in which he is a candidate, and, if elected, must resign his administrative position when his term in the elected office begins. In other respects, such persons will be governed by the same policies which have been defined above. CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES Classified employees of the University are free to engage in all forms of political activity which do not interfere with the performance of the duties of their positions. If they choose to become candidates for elective office (e.g., membership in the General Assembly, the City Council, or the County Board of Supervisors), they will be expected to limit campaigning to off-duty hours, and any campaign activity in which they may engage during working hours will be chargeable to annual leave or leave without pay. Supervisors are encouraged to apply as liberal a policy as is consistent with maintaining the efficiency of the unit's operations toward the granting of annual leave or leave without pay and the adjustment of work schedules to enable the employee to conduct his campaign, and to serve in the office, if elected. If a classified employee becomes a member of the General Assembly, he must assume leave status (either annual leave or leave without pay) during the time while the Assembly is in session. If he is called upon to perform duties or to exercise the functions of a member of the General Assembly at times when the Assembly is not in session, he must limit these activities to time outside University duty hours, or to time made available for them by his supervisor either by the granting of annual leave or leave without pay or by adjustment of work schedules. If a classified employee becomes a member of a City Council or of a County Board of Supervisors, he may ordinarily continue in his employment at the University, provided that the duties of the office to which he has been elected can normally be performed outside regular University duty hours. Duty time spent on any activities incident to his Council or Board membership will be charged to annual leave or leave without pay, unless adjustments in his work schedule can be made which, in the judgment of his supervisor, will not impair the efficiency of his unit's operations.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">REPORT FROM THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE BOARD AND THE STUDENT BODY Mr. George Palmer, Chairman of the Special Committee, reported that the Committee has completed its study of a letter to the Board from Mr. Stefan Underhill and Miss Mary Pat Morrissey, dated January 4, 1978. The Board referred the requests to the Special Committee at its regular meeting held January 28, 1978. In this letter, it was requested that a written copy of the tentative agenda of the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee be furnished to the Student Council President one week prior to each meeting, it being understood that last minute items may be added before the meeting. The Board, upon recommendation of the Special Committee agreed to furnish a copy of the tentative agenda of the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee meeting to the Student Council President one week before each meeting as requested. The letter of January 4 further requested that the Student Council officers be permitted to discuss specific items of the agenda with the Student Council as a whole. With respect to this request, the Board, on recommendation of the Special Committee, determined that the policies now in effect with respect to the discussion of agenda items be continued. The discussion revealed that substantial student input has been considered in most of these matters well before they are brought for final action to the Board, and that there is extensive and effective student participation in the administrative committee structure of the University.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DISCUSSION OF THE HONOR SYSTEM The Board continued a discussion of the Honor System begun at the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee meeting on June 1. At the Committee meeting, incoming Honor Committee Chairman John Richardson had distributed an analysis of a poll of faculty opinion on certain aspects of the system. Mrs. Holton raised a question about the effectiveness of the procedures in use for the honor orientation of teaching assistants, since Mr. Richardson had reported that problems for the Honor Committee were being generated by some inadequately oriented teaching assistants. She suggested that these procedures might be looked into by the administration. The President gave assurance that the administration will cooperate fully with the Honor Committee, but he said that the Honor system is a student system, and he is reluctant to take any action which might make it appear that honor procedures are being imposed by the faculty or administration.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ANNOUNCEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE GRAVES MOUNTAIN LODGE CONFERENCE, SEPTEMBER 12 and 13, 1978 Mr. George Palmer reminded the Board that on May 28, 1976, the Board approved guidelines that include "Members of the Board will, insofar as is possible, attend the annual fall conference customarily held at Graves Mountain Lodge." He advised that the conference will be held this year on Tuesday and Wednesday, September 12 and 13, 1978, at Graves Mountain Lodge.</field>

The Virginia Plan for Equal Opportunity in State-Supported Institutions of Higher Education (Revised 1978) and Board of Visitors Resolution C. Work Force Analyses I. REAFFIRMATION OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY POLICY The University of Virginia does not discriminate with regard to race, color, religion, national origin, political affiliation, handicap, sex or age in either education or employment. Programs of affirmative action to assure equality of opportunity for education and employment have been in effect here for many years, and have been steadily improved. By action of the Governor of Virginia on January 31, 1978, through Executive Order Number One, the policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia was stated as follows: "It is the policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia that employees of the Commonwealth and applicants for employment shall be afforded equal opportunity in all aspects of personnel management without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, political affiliation, handicap, sex or age." The policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia was endorsed and approved by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia on April 1, 1978. Executive Order Number One, the Procedures for Implementing Executive Order Number One and the resolution of the University's Board of Visitors are included in this plan as Appendix A. On March 18, 1978, the Governor of Virginia submitted to the Office for Civil Rights, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, The Virginia Plan for Equal Opportunity in State-Supported Institutions of Higher Education (Revised 1978). The submission of The Virginia Plan by the Governor was subject to the review and consideration by individual institutions' Board of Visitors. On April 1, 1978, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia agreed to participate in The Virginia Plan in accordance with interpretations consistent with The Virginia Plan's applicability to the University of Virginia. The Virginia Plan and Board of Visitors resolution are included in this plan as Appendix B. The University's plan for affirmative action and equal opportunity in education and employment, therefore, includes the Policy and Procedures promulgated by Executive Order Number One, as well as applicable parts of The Virginia Plan for Equal Opportunity in State-Supported Institutions of Higher Education (Revised 1978). The Executive Vice President is responsible to the President of the University for execution of all equal opportunity policies. The Administrator of Equal Opportunity Programs is responsible for developing, disseminating information on, assisting in the administration of, and reporting on the progress of equal opportunity programs throughout the University. The Director of Institutional Analysis is responsible for the development and production of numerical data for official reports and analyses relating to equal opportunity at the University. Frank L. Hereford, Jr. President June 1, 1978. II. DISSEMINATION OF POLICY A. Internal Dissemination The University's equal employment opportunity policy statement will be distributed to all University employees. Copies will be provided to new employees at orientation sessions and posted on prominent bulletin boards throughout University facilities. Annually it will be published in University communications media. It will also be published in all University employee handbooks. B. External Dissemination In the local community the University Director of Personnel will provide the policy statement to such recruitment sources as: educational institutions, local government, community action groups, minority and women's organizations and Chamber of Commerce officials. The University of Virginia has notified and will continue to notify all prospective employees of its equal employment opportunity policy by posting notices in the personnel offices as well as in other conspicuous locations so that they will have information to avail themselves of its benefits. All University catalogs, program brochures, and other printed materials describing the academic programs of the University will contain the policy statement. All help-wanted advertising will contain the clause, "an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer." III. RESPONSIBILITY FOR POLICY IMPLEMENTATION A. The ultimate responsibility for equal employment compliance rests with the President as Chief Executive Officer of the University of Virginia. Responsibility and authority for administration of the affirmative action plan has been delegated to the Executive Vice President. B. This responsibility shall include but not be limited to the following: 1. Initiate efforts to recruit, appoint, retain and upgrade qualified minorities and women at all levels of employment. 2. Counsel University management concerning the need for their personal attention to EEO in order to reach the objective of providing an atmosphere of non-discrimination and equal opportunity within the University. 3. Carry out the intent and spirit of the affirmative action plan by insuring that all managers, supervisors, and employees are aware of their responsibilities. 4. Familiarize officials, managers and supervisors with provisions of the Civil Rights laws and Executive Orders pertaining to affirmative action. C. The Administrator of Equal Opportunity Programs is responsible for developing, disseminating information on, assisting in the administration of, and reporting on the progress of equal opportunity programs throughout the University. D. The Director of Institutional Analysis is responsible for the development and production of numerical data for official reports and analyses relating to equal opportunity at the University. E. Advice concerning the legal aspects of this program is the responsibility of the Attorney General's Office. (Pursuant to Section 2.1-121 of the Code of Virginia.) IV. EMPLOYEE WORK FORCE ANALYSES A. Work Force Analysis In accordance with the requirements of Revised Order 4 of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs regulations, the University has analyzed the overall composition of its work force as well as that existing in the various divisions and functional units of the University by job title, minority group status and sex. These detailed analyses are included in this plan as Appendix C and are as follows: 1. Analysis of full-time instructional faculty by academic rank, tenure status, minority status, sex and salary code. 2. Analysis of full-time instructional faculty by academic rank, tenure status, minority status, sex and salary code within academic divisions. 3. Analysis of full-time instructional faculty by academic rank, tenure status, minority status, sex and salary code for departments within schools. 4. Analysis of non-instructional employees by job class, minority status, sex and salary code for each EEO-6 category. 5. Analysis of non-instructional employees by job class, minority status, sex and salary code within functional units or departments. B. Availability Analysis 1. Instructional Faculty. Requirements for employment as a full-time faculty member at the University typically include the attainment of a doctoral degree in a particular academic area. In the schools of Architecture, Nursing and Law, a doctoral degree may not be required, but a masters degree or J.D. degree is generally required. The University of Virginia recruits faculty from national pools. Thus the female and minority availability pools for instructional faculty contained in this plan are based upon recent national degree productivity data. The availability percentages by academic area for females, minorities, and blacks are as follows: Academic Area % Female % Minority % Black Architecture 21 11 6 Arts and Sciences 20 4 2 Commerce 6 5 2 Graduate Business 6 5 2 Education 26 11 8 Engineering 1 5 1 Law 9 6 4 Medicine 10 7 4 Nursing 97 8 6 The following sources were utilized in developing the above availability percentages: (a) Professional Women and Minorities (last updated July, 1977); a manpower data resource service of the Scientific Manpower Commission, American Association for the Advancement of Science. (b) Preliminary report on total masters and doctors degrees awarded in appropriate disciplines, for years 1975-76 obtained from HEW, Office of Civil Rights, March, 1978. (c) American Association of Medical Colleges, Washington, D. C. 2. Non-instructional employees. The University of Virginia is by far the largest employer in the Charlottesville-Albemarle and surrounding county area. The following information concerning the labor force composition appears in Manpower Information for Affirmative Action Programs, State of Virginia, 1976: Labor Force Total % Female % Minority % Black State of Virginia 2,306,000 39.9 18.9 17.6 Charlottesville-Albemarle 64,430 39.3 19.2 18.5 Except for the two EEO categories, Executive/Administrative/Managers and Professional, non-instructional employees are hired predominately from the Charlottesville-Albemarle and surrounding county area. Executive/Administrative/Managers are recruited from national availability pools, while Professionals are recruited from state availability pools. Educational requirements for these two categories generally include a bachelor's degree and may, in addition, require graduate education or professional certification. The availability percentages for non-instructional employees by EEO category for females, minorities and blacks are tabulated as follows: EEO Category % Female % Minority % Black Executive/Admin./Mgr. 21 4 4 Professional 28 7 5 Clerical/Secretarial 75 7 7 Technical/Para-Prof. 58 8 8 Skilled Crafts 4 11 11 Service/Maint. 47 41 41 The following sources were utilized in developing the above availability percentages: (a) Virginia Employment Commission, Richmond, Virginia. (b) Manpower Information for Affirmative Action Programs, State of Virginia, 1976, Manpower Research Division, Virginia Employment Commission, Richmond, Virginia. C. Utilization Analysis On the basis of the preceding Work Force Analysis and Availability Analysis, the University has determined where utilization of females, minorities and blacks is less than the proportion in the relevant labor market area for both instructional faculty and non-instructional employees. This analysis is displayed in Table 1 for instructional faculty by academic division and in Table 2 for non-instructional employees by EEO category. Source references for each availability percentage are also provided.

SUMMARY OF GOALS AND TIMETABLES Consistent with The Virginia Plan for Equal Opportunity in State-Supported Institutions of Higher Education (Revised 1978), which was approved by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and the resolution adopted by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia (Appendix B), the University has made the following commitments: 1. The University of Virginia is committed to the objective of achieving a proportion of female, minority and black instructional faculty at least equal to the percentage of female, minority and black persons with the credentials required for such positions in the relevant labor market area. 2. Until the above objective is met, the University of Virginia is committed to the interim objective that the proportion of females, minority and black persons hired to fill faculty vacancies shall not be less than the proportion of females, minorities and blacks with the credentials required for such positions in the relevant labor market area. 3. The University of Virginia is committed to the objective of achieving a proportion of female, minority and black non-instructional employees by job category that is at least equal to the percentage of female, minority and black persons with the qualifications required in the relevant labor market area. 4. The University of Virginia is committed to make reasonable yearly progress toward achieving these objectives in the 1982-83 academic year. 5. These objectives will be reviewed at least annually to reflect changes in availability pools or other circumstances which may affect this plan. It should be understood that no objective established in this plan shall in any way constitute a quota and that it shall not be treated as such. Moreover, it shall not be interpreted to require the hiring of a person who is not qualified or the hiring of a less qualified person in preference to a person who is more qualified. The commitment to attempt to increase the number of female, minority and black employees in the University of Virginia is just that--a pledge to action. As such, the University's commitment means only that a good faith effort will be undertaken to meet these objectives. The University, through its Board of Visitors, shall retain sole authority and responsibility for the employment policies of the University, subject to the limitations of applicable law. VI. ACTION ORIENTED PROGRAMS The University of Virginia shall continue actively to seek, hire, and retain qualified female, minority and black employees. Specific action oriented programs now being carried out by the University and relating to all aspects of personnel management are contained in the Procedures for Implementing Executive Order Number One (Appendix A). These procedures, including the action oriented programs, were approved by the Board of Visitors of the University by resolution dated April 1, 1978. They are applicable to recruitment, selection, placement, training, promotion and terminations. VII. INTERNAL REVIEW AND REPORTING SYSTEMS Continuing reviews will be made to evaluate the success of the University's affirmative action plan. The following internal review and reporting systems are in effect: 1. Each academic and administrative unit of the University will analyze regularly the composition of its faculty and staff by sex and minority group to help determine if qualified members of both sexes and each minority group are employed in accordance with the potential supply of such persons possessing the necessary qualifications in the relevant labor market areas. 2. The Director of Institutional Analysis will make periodic surveys of qualified applicants for, and the supply of potential appointees to, instructional and faculty-level research positions by sex and by minority group in the relevant labor market area. The results of such surveys will be transmitted to academic divisions. 3. The Director of Institutional Analysis will make periodic surveys of qualified applicants for, and the supply of potential appointees to, non-instructional positions by sex and minority group in the relevant labor market areas. The results will be transmitted to employing units. 4. Each academic Dean will maintain and periodically analyze applicant flow, job offer, hiring, promotion, and termination data by sex and minority group for instructional faculty. 5. The Director of Personnel will maintain and periodically analyze applicant flow, job offer, hiring, promotion, transfer, and termination data by sex and minority group for non-instructional employees. 6. The Executive Vice President will prepare an annual summary of progress toward meeting the affirmative action objectives of this plan for submission to the President. 7. The President will review this plan at least annually and make appropriate recommendations to the Board of Visitors concerning any needed revisions. 8. Reports required by Federal laws regarding equal employment opportunity matters will be promptly rendered.</field>
