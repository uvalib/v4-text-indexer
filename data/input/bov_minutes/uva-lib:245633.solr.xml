Cabell, John H. Cocke, Ths. J. Randolph, and Wm. C. Rives. Mr. Johnson was unanimously chosen Rector. The Reports of the Bursar &amp; Proctor were handed in.The following resolutions were passed. 1. Resolved that the Book of the Chairman be referred to Mr. Rives to read and note such parts of it as may require the action of the Board. 2. Resolved that the Book of the Faculty be referred to Mr. Randolph to read &amp; to note such parts of it as may require the action of the Board. 3. Resolved that Messrs. Cabell &amp; Cocke be appointed a committee of Inspection. 4. Mr. Rives was appointed a committee of Finance, 5. Resolved, that in consequence of the Board having granted to Mr. Tucker leave of absence from the University in order that he might make a trip to Europe, which could not be accomplished with certainty in any precise number of days, the abatement made from Mr. Tucker's Salary of one hundred &amp; forty four dollars, be remitted. 6. Resolved that the application of Smith Bankhead contain'd in his letter of July 1st 1840 to be excused from the observance of the Uniform Law, be rejected. 7. Resolved that the application of Th: H. Watts to be permitted to take the Degree of A. M. without the required graduation in the Greek language &amp; Literature, be rejected. The Board then took a recess to attend the Exercises of the Public Day. They met again in the Afternoon; but, that the several committees might have time to prepare their reports, adjourned to meet again on Monday. Monday, July 6th. 1840. Present as on Saturday. In consequence of Mr. Cabell's indisposition Messrs. Rives &amp; Randolph were added to the Committee of Inspection. The Committee of Finance reported. The committee of the Faculty, to whom was referred the subject of a supply of water for the University made a report, which was ordered to be laid upon the Table. The following resolutions were passed: 1. Resolved that Doct: Henry Howard be appointed Professor of Medicine in the University of Virginia. About 12 O. C. M. Mr. Randolph retired from the Board. 2. Resolved that Professor Davis be appointed Chairman of the Faculty for the ensuing year. 3. The Proctor having appointed A. C. Grimm Hotel Keeper, and having submitted to the Board his Bond with the endorsement thereon of an agreement between himself &amp; Mrs. Margaret Ward- Resolved that the arrangement indicated by the endorsement aforesaid be approved by the Board. A letter from the professors of the Medical school to the Visitors on the subject of the disadvantages of the site of the present Infirmary, &amp; recommending to the Board to authorise another Building to be rented for the purpose between the University &amp; the town of Charlottesville having been laid before the Board: Messrs. Cabell, Rives, &amp; Randolph, the Committee on the preceeding resolution. 4. Resolved that a Committee of Visitors be appointed and charged with the duty of confering with the Professors of the Medical School as to the details of the most expedient plan of an Infirmary to be attached to the Medical School of the University, &amp; of making enquiries as to a suitable site for said Infirmary, and that the Committee make report to the next annual meeting of the Visitors: Messrs. Cabell, Rives, &amp; Randolph, the comm'ee on the preceding resolution 5. Resolved that the sentence of Expulsion pronounced by the Faculty against Henry C. Chambers and John W. Pope be remitted. The Visitors, in thus interposing between the sentence of the Faculty and it's execution, do not intend to cast the shadow of censure on that Body, who could not have done otherwise than apply the penalty of the Law to a manifest violation of it. But an application by those Students to the Board, praying a remission of their sentence presents an array of circumstances &amp; considerations strongly and respectfully urged in extenuation of their transgression, which, in the opinion of the Board, should make an effectual appeal to their favorable consideration. A letter from the professor of Natural Philosophy having been read wherein application is made to the Visitors to augment &amp; improve the means of illustration in his department: 6. Resolved that the said Professor have authority to procure, on account of the University the list of Instruments specified in his letter, and such others as he may deem essential, provided the whole cost thereof do not exceed three hundred Dollars, and that the proctor shall be authorised to draw on the Bursar for the requisite amount. 7. Resolved that the Proctor refund to professors Tucker and Cabell without Interest the sums which are or shall be severally advanced by them for the improvements and additions heretofore authorised to be made in the pavilions respectively occupied by them. 8. Resolved that the accounts of the Proctor, Patron &amp; Bursar, during the periods for which they may not have been already examined and reported upon, together with the report of Commissioner Watson on the accounts of the Patron for the Session of 1838-9 be referred to a committee of two members of this Board, and that the said committee be authorised to employ an accountant to aid them in the investigation if they shall deem it necessary to do so:- Messrs. Rives &amp; Randolph were appointed a Committee to carry the preceeding resolution into effect. About dinner time Mr. Rives withdrew from the Board, which being thus left without a quorum, adjourned till tomorrow. Tuesday July 7. The board met. Present Messrs. Johnson, Cabell, Cocke &amp; Randolph. The following resolutions were passed 1. Resolved that all favorable recommendations for admissions of Students under age by the Faculty be referred to the Executive Committee, who may admit such as they deem within the equity of the enactments. 2.

From these compositions, the Faculty shall select the two best, which shall be spoken on the public day; &amp; return the others to their respective authors, with the seals unbroken. 8.

Resolved, that the plan for converting the Gymnasia into two apartments for lecture rooms submitted by Genl. Cocke be adopted; and that the proctor, under the supervision of the Executive Committee, in order to have the same executed, be directed to advertise forthwith for contractors to undertake the work, and the proposals be accepted which may be offered upon the best terms, &amp; under circumstances which may afford the best hope of the fulfilment of the wishes of the Board in getting the job done of the best materials, faithfully put together, and at fair &amp; reasonable prices, &amp; to be compleated as soon as practicable: including the excavation of a space at least four feet wide parallel with the South walls, of the said Gymnasia, &amp; extending from the steps of the Rotunda to the porticos of the Pavilions 1 &amp; 2 respectively.
