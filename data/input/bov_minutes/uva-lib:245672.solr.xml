Resolved, first, That with the view of expanding the sphere of usefulness of the University of Virginia in conformity with the intentions of its eminent founder, Thomas Jefferson, it has become expedient to appoint a special agent and to empower him to solicit endowments, benefactions, donations, and contributions, in every available form, from the liberal and philanthropic at home and abroad. Second, That the compensation of such special agent appointed by the Board of Visitors shall be contingent on such terms and conditions as said Board shall deem it expedient to establish.

Resolved that in reply to the communication of Professor Price, the Rector is instructed to inform him that the salary paid the Chair of Greek was $3,000.00 for each session; and we consider that when he was paid the said sum of $3000.00 for the session of 1881-82, he received all that was due him; and that his successor is entitled to receive $3000.00 for the session of 1882-83, regardless of the time of his acceptance of his appointment as Professor of Greek.

Resolved that a committee of two be appointed to confer with Prof: Jno. R.

Whereupon, Judge Bell and Mr. Ruffin were appointed the Committee to confer with Prof. Page. Resolved that the $200.00 appropriated to the Schools of Chemistry be divided between them as may seem best in the opinion of the Executive Committee. Resolved that the designation of the several Schools in the University affected by the establishment of the Chair of English shall be fixed by the Faculty in accordance with the Report of the Faculty upon the scope &amp;c of the Chair of English; and that the said School of English, as well as the modification of the style and scope of the other Schools affected thereby shall be as of the first of October, 1882.
