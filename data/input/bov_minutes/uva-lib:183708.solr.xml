      <field name="fulltext">AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE GUIDELINES FOR STUDENT ACTIVITIES CURRENT FUND ALLOCATION The following resolution was adopted by divided vote: RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Guidelines for Student Activities Current Fund Allocation be, and hereby are, amended and restated as follows: RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Student Activities Committee shall be charged with the authority and responsibility, under the President, for supervision of the Student Activities Fund which is made up of student activities fees. With respect to allocation from the Fund, unless otherwise directed by the President, the procedures shall be as follows: the budgets of all organizations will be reviewed by Student Council and if approved, Student Council will allocate funds from student activities fees to the organizations. Funds may be allocated by Student Council to recognized student organizations in the following categories, The Rector and Visitors having determined that activities in these categories are related to the educational purpose of the University: 1. student governments and councils; 2. departmental, academic, and curricular activities; 3. club sports; 4. curricularly-oriented publications, student newspapers, and student news magazines; 5. the student radio and television stations; 6. cultural and fine arts activities; 7. the University designated coordinating agency for student volunteer service activities; 8. student clinical training programs; 9. hobby organizations; 10. non-partisan groups whose predominate purpose is to present speakers on a non-partisan basis to speak on topics of probable general interest to the University; 11. student legal services; 12. University service organizations whose primary benefits accrue to non-members and whose purpose is related to an academic program or course of study; and 13. student organizations acting as spokesmen for groups of students protected by federal non-discrimination legislation. No monies from these funds shall be given: 1. for honoraria or similar fees; 2. for religious activities or activities sponsored by religious organizations; 3. for social entertainment or for organizations whose activities are substantially social; 4. for organizations when admission to the organization is restricted by reason of race, religion, national origin, political affiliation, or sex. Notwithstanding these requirements, a club sport may restrict membership based on sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. Organizations may also make requirements based on vocal range or quality which may result in a chorus or choruses of one or predominantly one sex. In determining cases of discrimination it is not sufficient to look merely to the constitution of such an organization but to its actual practices and operations. 5. for activities which would jeopardize the University's status under Section 501 (3) (c) of The Internal Revenue Code. 6. for political activities or activities sponsored by political organizations. Political activities are, in general, those normally engaged in by political parties or special interest groups, such as electioneering or lobbying. Electioneering shall include the broad range of those activities incidental to the promotion of partisan political ideas or programs and their representatives. Lobbying shall include any activity whose purpose is to procure or prevent, the acceptance of any social, economic or political theory as an operating principle or policy. This shall not include engaging in not-partisan analyses, study, or research or making those results available to the public. A public interest organization will not fail to meet the test merely because it advocates, as an insubstantial part of its activity, the adoption or rejection of legislation. The ceiling on the aggregate amount allocated to all such organizations will be the then current total student activities fees. Each organization whose budget is reviewed by the Student Council will have a right of appeal to the Student Activities Committee. Any student or student group may also appeal to the Student Council and to the Student Activities Committee. If no appeal is taken, a Student Council officer will draw a check on the Student Activities Fund for the amount specified by Council payable to the organization receiving the allocation. The Student Activities Committee shall examine on its own motion any budgets that may be approved by the Student Council for organizations deemed by the Committee to be within the categories noted above.</field>
