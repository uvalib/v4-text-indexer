(Offered by Mr. Garnett). MAZYCK WILSON SHIELDS ESTATE: Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, appeared before the Board and made the following report upon the present status of the University's interest in the Estate of the late Mrs. Mazyck Wilson Shields, who died a resident of Washington, D. C., on the 12th day of November, 1941. The members of this Board will recall that by the will of Mrs. Shields all of the residue of her estate is given one-half to the Board of Visitors of "The Virginia Military Institute" and the other half to the "Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia". I am advised by Mr. Mahlon C. Masterson, Attorney for Mr. Richard C. Marshall, Administrator d.b.n. c.t.a. of this estate, that approximately $3500.00 in cash will be turned over to each of the two institutions from the residuum of the estate upon final distribution of the estate, and, in addition to this money, the residue of the estate consisted of the following real and personal property - REAL ESTATE (1) "Tract (5) Block (3) Section (27) Township (16) South, Range (30), East, Marion County, Florida", containing 10 acres, more or less, etc. (2) "Tract (3) and (4) Block (3), Section (27) Township (16) South, Range (20) East, Marion County, Florida", containing 20 acres, more or less, etc. (3) "The Southwest quarter (SW¼) of the Southeast quarter (SE¼) of Section twenty-eight (28) Township Sixteen (16) South, Range (20) East", containing 40 acres, more or less".

VALUE Crews 11/10,000ths 24.75 Laird 14/7,500ths 105.00 West Cole 4/ 8,750ths 14.00 Dean Cole 5/2,500ths 16.25 Jamison 15/5,000ths 22.50 Christian &amp; 2nd Half 10/ 2,500ths 40.00 Joe Lee 8/ 7,500ths 12.00 Muckelroy Heirs 3/ 2,500ths 7.50 M. Bryson 50/ 5,000ths 25.00 $ 267.00 AS TO THE REAL ESTATE By referring to the minutes of the meeting of this Board held on October 2, 1943, it will be seen that Mrs. Shields had entered into a contract, dated May 31, 1940, with Southern Tung Land and Realty Company, of Ocala, Florida, for development of said 10 acre tract and had agreed to pay said Company a substantial sum on this account; that at the time of said meeting the sum of $1012.50 was due said Company under said contract, and that on May 22, 1944, an additional $337.50 would fall due - a total of $1350.00. And a resolution was adopted by this Board at said meeting of October 2, 1943, authorizing conveyance of the University's one-half undivided interest in said 10 acre tract to Tung Land Development Company, in consideration of the release by that Company of its rights under the contract aforesaid. And on October 29, 1943, a similar resolution was adopted by the Board of Visitors of The Virginia Military Institute authorizing conveyance of its one-half undivided interest in said 10 acre tract to said Company, upon like consideration. Pursuant to these resolutions a deed was prepared, executed on behalf of The Virginia Military Institute and the University, and was delivered to and accepted by said Tung Grove Development Company by which said 10 acre tract was conveyed to said Company for the consideration above set out, said Company uniting in said deed and releasing all of its rights under the contract of May 31, 1940. The Virginia Military Institute and The University of Virginia still own the other two tracts of 20 and of 40 acres, respectively, in Marion County, Florida, and it would seem advisable that some action be taken at once looking to the future management, lease, sale or partition of these two tracts of land. AS TO THE SHARES OF STOCK The stock certificates of the various mining Companies listed above are all of course in the name of Mazyck Wilson Shields. Mr. Mahlon C. Masterson, Attorney for Mr. Marshall, the Administrator, and I have made a thorough investigation as to the present value of these stocks and we are advised, reliably, we believe, that there is at present no market for any of these issues. Several of the Companies have ceased to exist, of others no trace can be found, and the administrator is unable to have actual transfers of the certificates made even if some equitable basis of division between the two Institutions can be worked out. In view of this situation your Attorney suggests that some arbitrary method of division of these worthless stocks be agreed upon so that final settlement of the estate may be effected as speedily as possible. AS TO THE OIL AND GAS LEASES. I am advised that all of these leases are paying small quarterly dividends or royalties and that the appraised values as set out above were based in each case upon these returns. I am further advised by Mr. Masterson that the Administrator has received an offer from Everets Drilling Company, of Dallas, Texas, to purchase all of the leases for the sum of $267.00. The acceptance of this offer should be seriously considered, or some method of division of these leases between the two institutions agreed upon. Respectfully submitted, W. Allan Perkins, Attorney. After a full discussion of the several questions submitted in the foregoing report the following resolutions were proposed, seconded and adopted - 1st. By Mr. Garnett, seconded by Dr. Haden: RESOLVED: That the question of management, lease, partition or sale of the one-half undivided interest of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia in the two tracts of land situated in Marion County, Florida, containing 20 acres and 40 acres, respectively, and which passed to said University under the will of Mrs Mazyck Wilson Shields, deceased, be and is hereby referred to a special committee composed of the Rector, the President, and Dr. W. D. Haden, which committee is hereby given full power to manage, lease or to sell said tracts of land, or either of them, for such amount and upon such terms as they may deem wise, or to make partition of said two tracts or of either of them, so that The Virginia Military Institute and The University of Virginia may each hold title to a portion of said land separate and apart from the other. And, in case of lease or leases, sale or sales, or partition of said tracts of land, or of either of them, J. L. Newcomb, President, is hereby expressly empowered and directed to execute in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, any contract or contracts, deed or deeds by which the whole or any part or parts of said lands are leased, conveyed, or partitioned, and E. I.

      <field name="fulltext">I am advised that all of these leases are paying small quarterly dividends or royalties and that the appraised values as set out above were based in each case upon these returns. I am further advised by Mr. Masterson that the Administrator has received an offer from Everets Drilling Company, of Dallas, Texas, to purchase all of the leases for the sum of $267.00. The acceptance of this offer should be seriously considered, or some method of division of these leases between the two institutions agreed upon. Respectfully submitted, W. Allan Perkins, Attorney.</field>
