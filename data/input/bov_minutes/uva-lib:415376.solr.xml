Carrington, Jr., President Newcomb and Governor Colgate W. Darden, Jr. Also present were Messrs. Eggers and Young of the firm of Eggers &amp; Higgins, architects for the new buildings. DEATH OF DR. W. D. HADEN: The President announced to the meeting the death of Dr. W. D. Haden, a member of the Board, which occurred on April 8, 1945. The Rector was requested to prepare resolutions with respect to his services as a member of the Board. MEMORIAL TO DR. WILLIAM DANDRIDGE HADEN Dr. William Dandridge Haden served as a member of this Board from July, 1944 until his death, at the University Hospital, on the morning of April 8, 1945, after an extended heart illness. Dr. Haden was a valuable and efficient member of this Board and his wise counsel was appreciated. He was active in the general work of the Board, and was a member of its Finance Committee. Dr. Haden was a leader in the civic and business life of Charlottesville. He was President of the National Bank and Trust Company; was Mayor of Charlottesville for three terms, and was a practitioner of medicine for over twenty years. He was a native of Fluvanna County, son of the late Eldridge G. Haden, who served two terms as Mayor of Charlottesville. His mother was the former Miss Martha Douglas Early, of Campbell County. After attending public schools in Fluvanna and Campbell Counties, he entered the University of Virginia and was graduated from the medical department in 1910. Following a postgraduate course at Johns Hopkins, he returned to Charlottesville, where he successfully practiced his profession for twenty-three years. In 1933 he gave up his practice to accept the presidency of the National Bank and Trust Company. Dr. Haden was elected a member of the city council, on September 1, 1930, and two years later was chosen vice-president of that body. In September, 1934, he was elected mayor and, at the close of his term, was re-elected to serve another two years. In the fall of 1940 he was again named mayor, succeeding George T. Huff. Throughout his twelve years on the city commission he played an important part in the city's development along many lines. In July, 1944, Dr. Haden was appointed by Governor Darden as a member of the Board of Visitors of the University to succeed the late Hollis Rinehart. Following the expiration of Mr. Rinehart's term, Dr. Haden was again appointed for a full four-year term. Dr. Haden was connected with various business enterprises. He was president of the Martha Jefferson Hospital; vice-president of the Jackson Park Hotel Corporation, which owns the Monticello Hotel, and a director of the Jefferson-Lafavette Theatres. He was treasurer of the Virginia Cancer Foundation, and a member of several medical associations, county, state and national. He was a member of Charlottesville Lodge, No. 389, B.P.O.E.; a member of the Redland Club, and the Farmington Country Club. Dr. Haden married Miss Sallie C. Pugh, daughter of the late Llewellyn and Josephine Randolph Pugh, of New Orleans, Louisiana. She survives, with four children; Mrs. Sallie H. Yon, wife of Lieutenant-Commander Joseph L. Yon, United States Navy, now in the South Pacific area; Llewellyn P. Haden, of this city; Dr. W. D. Haden, Jr., United States Navy, now stationed in Washington, D. C.; and Mrs. Elizabeth Catherine Smith, wife of Lieutenant William Massie Smith, United States Marine Corps Reserve, now somewhere in the Pacific. He also leaves a sister, Mrs. Anna D. Scruggs, and a brother, Abner E. Haden, both residents of Charlottesville. Dr. Haden commanded the respect and regard of every member of this Board, and his death has come at a time when his usefulness had broadened and his public service had developed. Each member of this Board desires to express appreciation of Dr. Haden, sympathy for those nearest and dearest to him and, to this end, this Memorial is directed to be spread upon the minutes of this Board and a copy is directed to be sent to Mrs. Haden.
