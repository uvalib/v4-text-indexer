The professors, assistant professors, and other members of teaching staff and the proctor, shall aid the President in the care and government of the institution. 4. The President shall be charged with the general supervision of the interests of University, and shall have special oversight of the several departments and schools of instruction of the University. It shall be his duty to consult with the professors with respect to the development of their various departments, and the general interest of the University. The professors shall have liberty in the development and administration of their own departments, subject to the recommendations of the faculty as a whole, and to the decisions of the Board. 5. The President shall preside on all public occasions and represent the University before the public. He shall fix and announce the dates of meetings, both regular and called of the general, and of each departmental faculty and he shall preside over the meetings of the faculties. It shall be his duty to determine the general nature of the duties and responsibilities of each faculty. 6. It shall be the duty of the President of the University to recommend to the Board all appointments for positions upon the teaching staff of the University, and to exercise such superintendence over the building properties, books and other properties as will insure their protection and appropriate use. 7.

The President shall have power to appoint for ratification by the Board of Visitors, a Dean of each department, the powers and duties of the Dean of the Academic Department to be determined by the President in consultation with the professor appointed to that office. 11. The President shall have the power to suspend or remove from the University any student, for any cause deemed by the former to be sufficient—reserving, however, to such student the right to appeal from the decision of the President to the Board of Visitors. And, if he deems it wise, he shall constitute a Board of Deans of all the departments to assist him in the exercise of these powers. 12. In case the President considers that he has just cause of complaint against a professor on account of inefficient conduct of his school, or any other reason, he shall in writing notify the professor of the grounds of complaint, coupled with an intimation that his case will be brought to the attention of the Board of Visitors for their decision and action. 13. All the laws of the University inconsistent with the foregoing are hereby repealed.

Christian of the Medical Department, Prof. W. M. Lile of the Law Department, Prof. W. M. Thornton of the Engineering Department, and such recommendations were approved by the Board, and the nominations confirmed. Whereas, the duties of the Dean of the Academic Department will be largely in excess of those attaching to the other Departments, it is hereby resolved that the salary of two hundred dollars per annum be and the same is hereby voted to that Deanship.

Resolved: That the compensation of Miss Tuttle for the work she is doing in the Library be increased from $30.00 to $40.00 per month. It being represented to the Board that the appropriation of $31,000.00 heretofore made for building a wing to the Hospital, in consequence of a mistake in the estimates, is insufficient to complete and equip the structure, and that unless the appropriation is enlarged, loss will ensue, it is resolved that those entrusted with the expenditure of said amount, be authorized to spend an additional amount, not exceeding the sum of $2,300.00. Resolved: That the thirteenth day of April, 1905, is selected as the date for the formal inauguration of Dr. Alderman as President of the University; that it is advisable there should be committees representing the Board, the Faculty, and the Alumni, to arrange for the ceremonies for that occasion, and that the entire matter be referred to the Executive Committee for consideration of details, with power to take such steps as may be deemed proper. Resolved: That, in consideration of his services as Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy, last year, and on condition that he serves in the same capacity during the current session, the indebtedness of Dr. Norford to the University be remitted. The President having submitted to the Board, the resignation of Mr. Fitz-Hugh as Professor of Latin, and Mr. FitzHugh having at the request of the Board appeared before it, the Board hereby testifies its confidence in Prof. Fitz-Hugh, and requests that he withdraw his resignation.
