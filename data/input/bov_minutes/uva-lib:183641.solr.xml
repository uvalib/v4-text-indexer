      <field name="fulltext">LOCATION OF NEW MEDICAL EDUCATION BUILDING The President presented to the Board a Topographic Map showing the site of and the location thereon of the proposed new Medical Education Building. In order to utilize the site, the President pointed out, it would be necessary to close Randall Street, Nassau Place and a 15 foot alley running parallel to and between Nassau Place and Park Place and to relocate the water, gas, sewer and storm sewer lines now located therein. He further pointed out that the University owned all the land on both sides of said streets and alley. The President reported that, in order to meet the deadline of March 1, 1966 for the filing of application for Federal Grant support under the provision of the Public Health Service Act, he had made application on behalf of the University to the City Council of Charlottesville to close the streets and alley referred to above and had undertaken on the University's behalf to state that it would bear the expense and grant the necessary easements to relocate the utilities, with the understanding that the Board of Visitors would be requested to adopt at this meeting a resolution making formal request of the City Council of the City of Charlottesville to close the streets and alley above referred to, and undertaking to bear the expense and grant the necessary easements to relocate the utilities. At the meeting of the City Council held on February 7th, 1966 the matter was referred to the City Planning Commission for recommendation. After consideration of the matter at its meeting on February 8th and a view of the location the City Planning Commission on February 11, 1966 made the following recommendations to be considered by the City Council at its next meeting on February 21st: RE: Request of the University of Virginia to close Randall Street, Nassau Place and a 15 foot Alley. The Planning Commission has studied the request of the University of Virginia to close the streets and alley in order for them to erect a new Medical Education Building on the south side of Jefferson Park Avenue west of Lee Street and respectfully recommends as follows: 1. That the streets and alley be closed as requested conditioned, of course, upon the University of Virginia granting new easements for storm sewer and utility lines and the relocating of said lines. 2. The Planning Commission further recommends that the University should grant perpetual easements on Jefferson Park Avenue and Lee Street, as shown on the attached plat, to enable the widening of Jefferson Park Avenue to provide for four (4) twelve foot (12') lanes of traffic and a six foot (6') sidewalk on the south side of Jefferson Park Avenue and the widening of Lee Street fifteen feet (15') on the west side. The Planning Commission is of the opinion that the widening of Jefferson Park Avenue is necessary to facilitate the movement of traffic at this location and to provide adequate turning movements into the University of Virginia Hospital. Mr. Kyle Roop, City Planning Engineer has stated that while the exact width of the desired easement along Jefferson Park Avenue cannot be determined until an accurate survey has been made by the City Engineering Department, he estimates that between Nassau Place and Lee Street the easement for street purposes will be approximately 10 feet at the Nassau Place end and approximately 8 feet at the Lee Street end, plus a parallel easement of 6 feet for sidewalk. After discussion, upon motion duly made and seconded it was, RESOLVED, that the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia hereby requests the City Council of the City of Charlottesville to take the necessary steps to close Randall Street from Park Place to Jefferson Park Avenue, Nassau Place from Lane Road to Randall Street, and the 15 foot alley lying between and running parallel to Park Place and Nassau Place, from Lane Road to Randall Street, with the understanding that in such event The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia will: (a) relocate at its expense the water, gas, sewer and storm sewer lines now located in said streets and alley, and grant easements to the City of Charlottesville for such utilities as relocated; (b) grant to the City of Charlottesville a perpetual easement for the purpose of widening Jefferson Park Avenue between Nassau Place and Lee Street, the easement for street purposes not to exceed 10 feet in width at any point, the exact width to be determined by a field survey, plus a parallel easement of 6 feet for sidewalk; (c) unless, after consultation with the City authorities it appears more feasible to widen Lee Street on its easterly side, grant to the City of Charlottesville a perpetual easement for the purpose of widening Lee Street on its west side between Jefferson Park Avenue and Park Place a width of 15 feet; RESOLVED, Further, that the President or Comptroller be, and either of them hereby is, authorized, empowered and directed to execute and deliver on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, an instrument or instruments granting to the City of Charlottesville easements for the purposes hereinabove outlined, and to take such other steps and execute such other and further documents as they, or either of them, may deem necessary or advisable, with respect to or in connection with the closing of said streets and alley; and the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Board be, and either or them hereby is, authorized, empowered and directed to affix the seal of the University of Virginia to any such instrument or document and to attest the same.</field>
