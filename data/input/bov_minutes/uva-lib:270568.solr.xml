Present the same members as on yesterday and also W. E. M. Word. Col Watts from the Committee on Grounds &amp; Buildings submitted the following report The Committee on Grounds &amp; Buildings have, according to order, given their attention to the subject, and it affords them pleasure to report that they find the property of the University to which their arrention has been directed, in as good order, in view of the condition of the finances as circumstances would admit of- The Rotunda has been much improved by the removal of decayed cornice and the substitution of new work, and by the addition of paint on those parts which were in immediate want of it. Much remains yet to be done to put that building and the Hall connected with it in good order, and they recommend an appropriation for that purpose as soon as the finances of the University will admit of it. The buildings on the lawn are all in want of paint, and it would be advisable in view of economy as well as comfort and ornament to have the work done as speedily as possible especially the cornice of the dormitories. The Laboratory under the charge of Prof. Mallet is in perfect order. Owing to the want of money resources, not much has yet been done with the proposed experimental farm. But a beginning has been made. The ground has been selected and fenced in, and a few experiments upon a small scale have been commenced, Root cuttings of the Ramce plant have been procured from Louisiana, and planted out with a view of ascertaining the possibility of its culture in this vicinity &amp; latitude-seed saved from Sea Island cotton raised here last year have been sown and the plants produced set out, in order to examine their tendency to return to the upland type of Sea Island cotton planted in the interior &amp; at a distance from the hebredizing influence of the ordinary replaced Cotton. A fresh planting of very superior Sea Island cotton seed from Charleston has been made with a view of pursuing further investigation. A remarkably prolific replaced cotton from Venezuala has also been tried. Some interesting experiments have also been made upon the influence of various simple contituents of Manures on tobacco, in the neighborhood of New Glasgow, near Lynchburg, and practically examined at the Laboratory- Sundry specimens of Marl from Westmoreland County have been examined, and the attention of the Laboratory students has been in part given to Chemical analysis as applied to agricultural purposes, and one of the students has devoted himself exclusively to this line of study-Your Committee believe that the Experimental Farm will be an important Department in the University at an early day. Nothing is required to give it success, but an improvement in our money resources. Very respectfully presented Thomas L. Preston Saml Watts. On motion Resolved that the foregoing report be approved and adopted. Ordered that the sum of $1000 be appropriated for outside painting. A conference between the Trustees of the "Miller Fund" and the Board of Visitors resulted in the following agreement.

Resolved that the Proctor be authorized to expend a sum not exceeding $350 in increasing the height of the Reservoir Wall. The Secretary of the Board of Trustees of the Miller Fund presented the following extracts from the minutes of their proceedings which were ordered to be recorded. "Resolved that the Trustees appropriate $1000 for next year, for the rent of the laboratory, $1000 for the salary of Prof. Mallet, $300 for the rent of Prof. Boeck's house and $200 towards the salary of Prof. Boeck." "Resolved that the Board of the Visitors be informed that the trustees of the Miller Fund estimate their fund for the current year at about six thousand dollars, making it practicable and advisable in their judgment with the concurrence of the Visitors to appoint a Professor of Practical &amp; Scientific Agriculture, and under that impression they recommend the Visitors to advertise for such appointment by the 6th day of September 1870 when the trustees will meet them for conference and nomination, and that in the meantime the Visitors be respectfully requested to provide for the complete organization of this School of Agriculture, under such plan as they deem best for the execution of the declared trusts of Mr. Samuel Miller decd."

But a beginning has been made. The ground has been selected and fenced in, and a few experiments upon a small scale have been commenced, Root cuttings of the Ramce plant have been procured from Louisiana, and planted out with a view of ascertaining the possibility of its culture in this vicinity &amp; latitude-seed saved from Sea Island cotton raised here last year have been sown and the plants produced set out, in order to examine their tendency to return to the upland type of Sea Island cotton planted in the interior &amp; at a distance from the hebredizing influence of the ordinary replaced Cotton. A fresh planting of very superior Sea Island cotton seed from Charleston has been made with a view of pursuing further investigation. A remarkably prolific replaced cotton from Venezuala has also been tried. Some interesting experiments have also been made upon the influence of various simple contituents of Manures on tobacco, in the neighborhood of New Glasgow, near Lynchburg, and practically examined at the Laboratory- Sundry specimens of Marl from Westmoreland County have been examined, and the attention of the Laboratory students has been in part given to Chemical analysis as applied to agricultural purposes, and one of the students has devoted himself exclusively to this line of study-Your Committee believe that the Experimental Farm will be an important Department in the University at an early day. Nothing is required to give it success, but an improvement in our money resources. Very respectfully presented Thomas L. Preston Saml Watts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday Morning June 30th 1870 The Board met according to adjournment. Present the same members as on yesterday. Resolved that Professor Boeck be designated to communicate the thanks of the Board of Visitors to Leander J. McCormick Esq. for his very valuable present of a Mower to the Agricultural Department. Resolved that $750 be appropriated for Printing and Advertising. Ordered that the election of a Chairman of the Faculty for next Session be postponed until the September meeting and that the present Chairman continue to discharge the duties of the Office until that time. Resolved that in view of the fact that the abolition of a maximum income for the Professors by Resolution in 1865 was made under a total misapprehension of the state of affairs at the University- and furthermore in consideration of the present financial exigency, the Board is compelled to restore the principle of a maximum salary as it existed prior to the war, and to enact that hereafter and beginning with the next session, no professor shall receive more than three thousand dollars, and without guaranteeing that amount to any who shall fall below, it is hereby ordered that whenever the salary and fees of any professor shall exceed three thousand dollars, such excess shall be paid into the Treasury of the University to be used for general purposes. Resolved in consequence of the adoption of the above resolution the arrangement by which the Faculty contributed two thousand dollars is necessarily abrogated- and the payment of the salaries of Professors Mallet and Boeck is assumed by the Board of Visitors.
