"Dear Sirs, I beg to transmit to your honorable body the enclosed memorandum and letter with the information that Mrs. Claiborne and Capt. Cabell have established in the School of English Literature a scholarship to be known as the Henry Coalter Cabell scholarship. Their decision is the result of an exchange of letters between Mrs. Claiborne and myself in which she expressed their desire to provide here some memorial of their lamented Father and in which I had the privilege of proposing several plans. Mrs. Claiborne requested that the scholarship be established in the Department of English Literature &amp; under the conditions set forth in the memorandum and modified by her letter. I make bold to suggest that both the memorandum and the pertinent portions of her letter be recorded. Very Respectfully, Charles W. Kent" 609 Grace Street, West. Richmond, Virginia My dear Dr. Kent, I had hoped very much to see you during the Educational Conference last week, and had I known you would return to the city from the University of Virginia, I should have made an effort to see you on Sunday; as it was, I had but a glimpse of you on the platform on Sunday night. I enclose the memorandum you sent me some time since which entirely meets with my approval and enclose checks for twelve hundred dollars for the establishment of a scholarship. Will you kindly place them in the proper hands? I thank you very much for all your kindness in this matter, which both my brother Captain Henry Cabell and myself very greatly appreciate. All that you have recommended meets with our entire approval except- we would like the scholarship open to all irrespective of wealth or position and not to be confined to those young men who need financial aid. I presume if at any future time we desire to increase the amount of this Scholarship there will be no difficulty in so doing. With very sincere appreciation of all your kindness in aiding me in this matter, I am, most cordially yours, Kate Cabell Claiborne. May First - 1903.

      <field name="fulltext">"To the Rector &amp; Visitors of The University of Virginia. "Dear Sirs, I beg to transmit to your honorable body the enclosed memorandum and letter with the information that Mrs. Claiborne and Capt. Cabell have established in the School of English Literature a scholarship to be known as the Henry Coalter Cabell scholarship. Their decision is the result of an exchange of letters between Mrs. Claiborne and myself in which she expressed their desire to provide here some memorial of their lamented Father and in which I had the privilege of proposing several plans. Mrs. Claiborne requested that the scholarship be established in the Department of English Literature &amp; under the conditions set forth in the memorandum and modified by her letter. I make bold to suggest that both the memorandum and the pertinent portions of her letter be recorded. Very Respectfully, Charles W. Kent"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">609 Grace Street, West. Richmond, Virginia My dear Dr. Kent, I had hoped very much to see you during the Educational Conference last week, and had I known you would return to the city from the University of Virginia, I should have made an effort to see you on Sunday; as it was, I had but a glimpse of you on the platform on Sunday night. I enclose the memorandum you sent me some time since which entirely meets with my approval and enclose checks for twelve hundred dollars for the establishment of a scholarship. Will you kindly place them in the proper hands? I thank you very much for all your kindness in this matter, which both my brother Captain Henry Cabell and myself very greatly appreciate. All that you have recommended meets with our entire approval except- we would like the scholarship open to all irrespective of wealth or position and not to be confined to those young men who need financial aid. I presume if at any future time we desire to increase the amount of this Scholarship there will be no difficulty in so doing. With very sincere appreciation of all your kindness in aiding me in this matter, I am, most cordially yours, Kate Cabell Claiborne.</field>

The Board was called to order by the Rector, and the following resolutions were adopted: Resolved: The Proctor having reported that under authority of the resolution of the Board at the last meeting he investigated the advisability of approving the sale of real estate belonging to the Austin fund in Chelsea &amp; Malden, Massachusetts, he has taken the advice of the counsel of the Board, Messrs. Loving &amp; Coolidge, of Boston, who upon a careful investigation &amp; with the assistance of a real estate expert they advised that immediate authority be given the trustees to make a sale of the property, and upon consultation with the chairman of the Executive Committee, the Proctor took the responsibility of authorizing such sale. Be it Resolved: That the action of the Proctor be approved. And the Proctor having further reported that the trustees of the Austin Fund advise that sale be made at $18,000. of the property at South Boston which was bought in by the trustees at a foreclosure sale of a mortgage held by the estate, the said property being now leased by the Ipswich Mills. Resolved: That authority be given for the sale of the property at the price named or to renew the lease to said Mills at the present rental. The Board of Visitors having been informed a facsimile copy of the original Declaration of Independence of the United States has been presented to the University by Judge James B. Sener, President of the General Alumni Association, to be hung in the Public Hall at the University, and desiring to express its appreciation of this thoughtful       on the part of Judge Sener, it is ordered that the thanks of the Board of Visitors to him be entered of record and that the Secretary of the Board furnish Judge Sener with a copy of this order. Resolved: That Professor Thornton be requested to nominate to the next meeting of the Board an Adjunct Professor in his department at a compensation of not exceeding $1500. per annum.

Resolved: That the election of a Librarian be postponed until the next meeting of the Board and that no appropriation be made at present for the salary of Librarian and that the Library be in charge of the assistant librarian until further ordered. The Board having received a request from Prof Noah K. Davis for assistance next session, regrets that it is unable at this time to comply with the request. The Board learns with pleasure that an oil portrait of the late Mr. Linden Kent has been presented to the University by his brothers, Hon. Henry T. Kent of St. Louis and Dr. Chas. W.

Resolved: That the sum of One Hundred Dollars be appropriated for the purpose of buying a horse for the use of Dr. Lambeth in his department. Resolved: That pursuant to the recommendation contained in the Proctor's report the sum of $600 00 be appropriated for the construction of granolithic walks in the University grounds, to be made under the supervision of the Proctor. Resolved: That pursuant to recommendation in Proctor's report, the sum of Eight Hundred Dollars is appropriated for the purpose of constructing a tank on Monroe Hill with necessary piping thereto. Resolved: That this Board wishes to and it does hereby, put on record some expression of its high and sincere appreciation of the efficient and unselfish manner in which Dr. P. B. Barringer has discharged the duties of Chairman of the Faculty during the important and trying period in which he has held this position, and to thank him in behalf of the Board and the University. The following report of the Miller Board Committee was presented, examined, approved &amp; ordered to be spread on the minutes of the Board: Your Miller Board Committee respectfully report that the Miller Board has apportioned the Miller Fund as follows: Dr. Tuttle's Salary $3000.00 Prof. Thornton's Salary 500.
