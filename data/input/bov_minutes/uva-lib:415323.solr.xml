In the matter of the Bequest of Walter F. Taylor to the University; the following report and resolution were approved: The President called the attention of the Board to the will of Walter F. Taylor of New York City, admitted to probate in the surrogate's Court of the County of New York on the 25th day of June, 1936, under which will Mr. Taylor created a trust of $50,000.00, with directions that the income be paid to Jessica Phillips McCall, during her life, and that after her death the income be paid to Fauntleroy Wight, during her life, and that after her death the principal sum be turned over to the University of Virginia. Under this will Lewis Cass Ledyard, Jr., and Roland L. Redmond were named Trustees of this trust; they qualified as such, and continued to act as Trustees until Mr. Ledyard's death on May 1st, 1936, and since that time Mr. Redmond and the United States Trust Company of New York have been acting as Trustees. The two life beneficiaries of the trust are still living. In order to settle the Estate of Mr. Ledyard it is necessary that his acts as Trustee of this trust be approved and the commissions to which he was entitled at the time of his death paid. Under date of May 24th, 1937, we received a letter from Messrs. Carter, Ledyard, &amp; Milburn, Attorneys of New York, enclosing a statement of the account of the Trustees from the date of their qualification down to April 17th, 1937, to which statement is attached a certificate of release discharging the Estate of Lewis Cass Ledyard, Jr., from any further liability, claims or demands that might be made against him as Trustee of this trust during his life time. This Certificate has already been signed by the said Jessica Phillips McCall and Fauntleroy Wight, the two life tenants, and the University is requested to execute this release as remainderman. Dr. Newcomb stated that he had personally examined the form of release, and had then referred the release and account to Mr. Perkins, as Attorney for the Board, with the request that he would make a further examination thereof, and give his opinion as to whether it is proper for the release to be executed on behalf of the University. Mr. Perkins reported that after some correspondence with Messrs. Carter, Ledyard &amp; Milburn he is satisfied that the account of the trustees, as submitted, is correct in all particulars, and that it is entirely proper for this Board adopt a Resolution authorizing the execution of the release on behalf of the University. It was thereupon RESOLVED that Mr. Frederic W. Scott, the Rector, be and he is hereby authorized to execute the release in question in the name of and on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and that E. I. Carrutners, Secretary of this Board, be and he is hereby authorized to affix the seal of the University of Virginia to said release and to attest the same, delivering said release to Messrs. Carter, Ledyard &amp; Milburn, Attorneys. And it is ordered that a copy of the foregoing report be spread with this Resolution as a part of the minutes of this meeting. IN RE MOUNTAIN LAKE POWER LINE: The President presented to the meeting a deed by which a portion of the electric power line and right of way in Giles County, near Mountain Lake, owned by the University, and which serves the Biological Station at Mountain Lake is conveyed to Appalachian Electric Power Company in consideration of $460.00 cash. It was explained that the purpose of this conveyance was to enable the Power Company to take over the portion of the line and right of way in question, and operate and maintain it at its own expense hereafter, it being thought that such an arrangement will be in the interest of eer service to the Biological Station. It was thereupon, RESOLVED, that Frederic W. Scott, the Rector, be and he is hereby authorized to execute said deed to Appalachian Power Company, and J. R. Thomson, ting Secretary of this Board, is hereby authorized to affix the seal of the University thereto, and to attest the same, and to deliver said deed upon payment of purchase price in full. In the matter of the Estate of Charles M. Fauntleroy. The President read the letters which have passed between his office and Messrs. Smith, Wild, Beebe and Cades, Attorneys for Mrs. Fauntleroy, and after some discussion it was RESOLVED, that subject to verification of all the facts in these letters, and subject further to approval of the President and the Attorney for the University, the Board consents to the release proposed. Recommendations covering repairs to the Delta Chi Flaternity House, at a cost of $597,00, and the insulation of attic of Faculty Apartment House with rock wool, were referred to the Chairman of the Buildings and Grounds Committee, Mr. Rinehart, and the President with power to act. In the matter of the sale of "Pantops" property, the following report and accompanying resolution were unanimously approved: The President then stated that by deed dated July 19, 1929, Mrs. Ida Ellis white and H. Landon white, her husband conveyed to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia a tract of land with all improvements thereon situated known as "Pantops" and containing 363 acres more or less, this deed being recorded in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of Albemarle County in D. B. 205 p. 429, and said property having been the Gift of Mr. Paul Goodloe McInitre to the University, Mr. McIntire having paid $47,500 cash therefor. The President further stated to the Board that it seemed probable that at some future time it may be advisable for the University to sell said property. After some discussion of the situation it was unanimously RESOLVED, that the President and Mr. Rihenart are hereby authorized to negotiate for the sale of said property with any prospective purchaser or purchasers, and to enter into a contract for the sale therof at a price of not less than $37,500.00 gross. Furthermore, in the event of a sale of said "Pantops" property the Rector is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia a good and sufficient deed by which said property shall be conveyed to the purchaser or purchasers upon settlement of the purchase price therefor, and E.

And the proceeds of such sale shall be set aside and used hereafter for such purposes as in the opinion of this Board may best advance the science of Psychiatry. The President presented to the Board the request that the University join in a suit about to be brought by the daughter of the late Philip A. duPont to determine whether the stock dividends on General Motors stock were income of belonged to the corpus of the duPont trust. After discussion, the Board decided not to intervene in the litigation over the question of the stock dividends on General Motors stock in the duPont trust, and authorized Mr. R. Gray Williams to communicate this to the attorneys representing the other interest, and to say that the Board would be glad to have the stock as dividend. The Board made the following awards of the Thomas Fortune Ryan Scholarships: First District Cecil L. Sinclair Second District Millard Cass Third District Edwin L. Seay Fourth District Francis duPont Lazenby Fifth District Benson E. Gammon Sixth District Richard B. Persinger Seventh District Francis H. Fife Eighth District J. Richmond Low Ninth District William E. Kelly Tenth District Elbert Turner The miscellaneous fellowship and scholarship appointments as recommended to the President by the several Departments, were presented by him and approved by the board. These will be found entered in the Scholarship book for 1937-38. The following resolution covering appointments during the summer was adopted: RESOLVED, that the President in consultation with the Deans and Committees appointed by the President from the staff, be empowered during the summer to employ those professors who have been authorized by the Board but who have not yet been selected. It is understood that all actions of the President and Committees will be brought to the Board for ratification at their next meeting. The President then presented to the Board a petition from Mrs. Brooke Payne requesting that the University issue a new diploma to her son in the name of Asher McComb, which name her son legally acquired since his graduation. At the time of his graduation his legal name was Asher Payne. The President explained that there was an administrative ruling to the effect that diplomas of the University could only be issued in the legal name of the person to whom it was awarded as of the date carried on the diploma. After a full discussion of the whole matter the following resolution was unanimously approved: RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that no diploma shall be re-issued to any degree holder which does not carry the legal name of the person as of the date of his graduation. The meeting then adjourned. C. Harding Walker RECTOR E. I. Carruthersa SECRETARY. Pro Tem</field>
