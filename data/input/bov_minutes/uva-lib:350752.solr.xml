Dr. Combs replied that that was a bridge that could be crossed in the future, and that before appointing her Dean of Women, the matter would again be taken up with the Board of Visitors PROPOSED INCREASE IN STUDENT FEES President Combs laid before the Board a schedule of fees charged in the general session, with suggested increases. Upon Mrs. Wailes' request for a postponement of consideration of the matter, it was ordered to be tabled.
