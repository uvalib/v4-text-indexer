The following letter from Dr. W. A. Lambeth, was referred to the Executive Committee, with power to act:- Jas. M. Page, Dean University of Virginia. Dear Sir:- I respectfully ask that you permit me to use the land between the Cemetery branch and Mrs. Towles' line, for the purposes of pasture and gardening. At present, it is swamp land grown up in rushes and brush. It will be greatly improved by use; and of course, can be surrendered immediately on demand of the University. Very truly yours, W. A. Lambeth, Sup't. Nov. 10th, 1913. The petition of the "University Golf Club" to use from the field on the left of McCormick Road, sufficient space for three additional holes, was read and granted.

Resolved: That the communication from the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway Company, be referred to the Executive Committee for report to the Board. Agreement in the Matter of the Will of Miss Mary Amelia Smith. Whereas, certain questions were raised concerning the probate and validity of the will of the late Miss Mary Amelia Smith of Fauquier County which questions were adjusted and settled among all the parties interested, by a certain agreement entered into on the 20th day of November 1912, between the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia and Edwin A. Alderman, as President of said University, and Thomas Smith and Frederick Waugh Smith, brothers of the testatrix, all of which more fully appears by the said agreement of Nov. 20th, 1912, which will be found of record in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of Fauquier County. And Whereas, it was at the time of the execution of said agreement, the desire and purpose of the said Thomas Smith to make in favor of the said Rector and Visitors of the University such provision as would carry into effect as hereinafter stated as far as possible the will of the said Miss Mary Amelia Smith so far as it was in the favor of the said University. Now therefore, This agreement made this 24th day of January, A.D., 1913, between the said Thomas Smith of the one part and the said Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, herein sometimes styled the University, witnesseth: That the said Thomas Smith in consideration of the premises herebyagrees and covenants to and with the said University that he will make a last will and testament by which he will devise and bequeath to the University after the death of his wife, such an amount of his individual estate as may make up to the said University the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) without any interest thereon which is estimated to be the additional amount said University would have received as a full beneficiary from the estate of the said Miss Mary Amelia Smith under the terms and provisions of her will had all of them gone into effect and been fully carried out; but all the property and funds which may pass to the said University, under the will of the said Thomas Smith shall be taken and held by the said University for the same uses and purposes and upon the same conditions as are mentioned and specified in that clause of the will of the said Miss Mary Amelia Smith which makes a provision in favor of the said University, so as to carry into effect her wishes in regard to the same, but while the said will of Miss Mary Amelia Smith is to control as to the uses and purposes of said Thomas Smith's devise and bequest, yet he suggests and requests that it be used to promote the teaching and study of Virginia History by some professorship or assistant professorship or fellowship or by some other appropriate arrangement to be named for or in the memory of the late Major-General and Ex-Governor William Smith. And the said Rector and Visitors of the said University, expressing their high appreciation of the generous and disinterested motives which have prompted the said Thomas Smith to enter into this agreement and acknowledging their obligation to him for his liberal and unselfish course in the matter, hereby accepts the provisions of this contract and agree to the carrying of the same into effect by way of supplement to the aforesaid contract of November 20th, 1912. 5 Witness the signature and seal of the said Thomas Smith and the signature of the said Rector and Visitors of the University by Armistead C.

      <field name="fulltext">Jas. M. Page, Dean University of Virginia. Dear Sir:- I respectfully ask that you permit me to use the land between the Cemetery branch and Mrs. Towles' line, for the purposes of pasture and gardening. At present, it is swamp land grown up in rushes and brush. It will be greatly improved by use; and of course, can be surrendered immediately on demand of the University. Very truly yours, W. A. Lambeth, Sup't. Nov. 10th, 1913.</field>
