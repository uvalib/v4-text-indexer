Venable Minor, set at $1200 a year at the time of his appointment as the University's Special Counsel, had been augmented by the Board several times during the past year to remunerate Mr. Minor for special tasks performed beyond the normal routine of legal work for the University. As a substitute for such occasional special remuneration, it was proposed that permanent compensation be set at $2400 a year After a brief discussion it was suggested that Mr. Minor be asked to write a letter that might be laid before the Board setting forth the proposal REQUEST BY MR.

Folks (31 October 1954, offering $300) and from James F. Bishop (5 November 1954, offering $310) proposing to purchase a tract of twenty acres of land in Marion County, Florida, owned by the University.
