      <field name="fulltext">ATTACHMENT A = Compensation &amp; Personnel Administration Plan ADMINISTRATIVE/PROFESSIONAL FACULTY COMPENSATION AND PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATION PLAN PURPOSE: In June of 1986 Governor Baliles formed the Decentralization Steering Committee to oversee a Higher Education Decentralization Study. The study was in response to a request from the college and university presidents to identify administrative functions where authority and responsibility could be appropriately delegated to the institutions. The Steering Committee established several task forces and charged them with making recommendations. The Personnel Decentralization Task Force observed that definitions found in the Governor's Consolidated Salary Authorization Plan specified by job title the types of positions which may be designated as teaching, research and administrative. The institutions' Boards of Visitors have full authority to appoint faculty, however, there are restrictions on their appointments of individuals to administrative and professional positions. The Task Force recommended that the Governor's Consolidated Salary Authorization be amended to provide for two distinct categories of faculty. These changes would permit each institution latitude to designate the number and types of positions which can be assigned administrative/professional status. The conflict between colleges and universities and the Commonwealth's Department of Personnel and Training is partially attributable to state governments view of these positions. The traditional view is that these positions should be directly and literally associated with academic or student personnel activities. This places a more narrow definition on them than is either realistic or necessary. In reality, virtually all administrative and professional personnel work in an academic environment. They constitute a unique and separate employment market in which the institution must compete. They are all associated either directly or indirectly with an academic enterprise. The Task Force's recommendation was to create a new category of positions entitled "Administrative and Professional Faculty". The definitions and qualification criteria are listed below: ADMINISTRATIVE FACULTY Administrative faculty require the performance of work directly related to the management of the educational and general activities of the institution, department or subdivision thereof. Incumbents in these positions exercise discretion and independent judgment and generally direct the work of others. Qualification Criteria --must have advanced degree; or training and work experience at a level which equates to an advanced degree; --must perform the duties and responsibilities associated with this category greater than 50 percent of the contractual time; --must regularly exercise discretionary actions; --the organization reporting relationship normally must not go lower than three (3) levels below the President (Agency Head) for institutions that are doctoral degree granting or have a student headcount enrollment of 10,000 or more, nor two (2) levels below the President for institutions that are non-doctoral degree granting and have a student headcount enrollment less than 10,000. In the Commonwealth's two teaching hospitals, the reporting relationship normally must not go lower than three (3) levels below the Chief Executive Officer of the hospital. PROFESSIONAL FACULTY Professional faculty require advanced learning and experience acquired by prolonged formal instruction and/or specialized work experience. This category is normally limited to librarians, counselors, coaches, lawyers, physicians, dentists, veterinarians and other professional positions serving education, research, athletic, medical, student affairs, and development functions or activities.

      <field name="fulltext">ATTACHMENT C = Changes in TIAA Life Insurance &amp; Disability Programs and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Program TIAA DISABILITY PROGRAM The University offers its faculty a long term disability plan that provides, in the event of disability, salary continuation of 60% of an individual's salary up to a maximum of $3,000 per month. The Faculty Benefits Committee recommends that the percentage of salary be increased from 60% to 66-2/3% and the monthly cap be raised from $3,000 to $6,000. This program enhancement will be more reflective of the salary structure at the University and will ensure income continuation at a reasonable level for disabled faculty. The increased premium cost is approximately $.30 per $100 of benefits which is an increase of $4,200 per month of additional premium. We concur with the Committee's proposal and recommend the changes become effective January 1, 1989. INCLUSION OF SUMMER INCOME IN DETERMINING BASE SALARY FOR TIAA DISABILITY The Faculty Benefits Committee further proposes that 9-month faculty should be insured for summer income that is paid through the University payroll system exclusive of overload payments. Payroll statistics indicate that approximately 57% of the 9-month faculty earn summer income. They proposed that the median salary of the last three summers serve as the formula for determining summer income. Summer salaries are not included in determining base salary at this time since the costs associated with modifying the TIAA retirement formulas to comply with the requirements of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 are as yet undetermined. TIAA LIFE INSURANCE FOR RETIREES The University currently provides faculty retirees a $2,000 death benefit under the TIAA Life Insurance Program. Survey data and discussions with the University's benefit consultants indicate that conventional burial expenses exceed $2,000. The Faculty Benefits Committee proposes an increase to $8,000. There are approximately 150 retirees with TIAA Life Insurance and the $8,000 death benefit level would increase our premium cost approximately $2,150 per month. Over the years, our claims experience has been very good, which has resulted in reduced premium rates. The proposed $8,000 death benefit, however, is "sum certain" and will be reflected in our future claims experience and, in turn, will impact our premiums. Because the costs associated with modifying the TIAA retirement formulas, as mentioned earlier, are not yet finalized, it is proposed that the death benefit be increased to $5,000 rather than the proposed $8,000. This change would increase our premiums by $1,000 per month. This change should become effective April 1, 1989. ELIGIBILITY FOR RETIREE TIAA LIFE INSURANCE Historically, faculty retirees have been eligible for the death benefit provision of the TIAA life insurance program if they were age 65 and had at least ten years of service. The Faculty Benefits Committee believes this eligibility criteria is overly restrictive and punitive toward faculty younger than age 65 but with several years of service, i.e., age 63 and 25 years of service. We concur with their conclusion, and we support their proposal to establish eligibility to be "at least age 55 and five or more years of service if the sum of the age and service is 70 or greater." We recommend this become effective April 1, 1989. ACCIDENTAL DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT PROGRAM For several years the University has offered faculty an option to participate in an Accidental Death and Dismemberment Plan. The insurance is available in increments of $5,000 from a minimum of $25,000 to a maximum of $200,000. The University contributes a portion of the premium costs ($1,000 per month) for the approximately 780 participants. The Faculty Benefits Committee recommends that the program be continued because of its popularity but that the University's contribution be discontinued. We concur with the Committee's proposal and recommend that the University's contribution be discontinued effective April 1, 1989. In conclusion, the following items should be presented at the January Board meeting. 1. TIAA Disability Program: The percentage of salary continuation should be increased from 60% to 66-2/3% and the monthly cap should be raised from $3,000 to $6,000. These changes should be effective January 1, 1989. 2. TIAA Life Insurance for Faculty Retirees: The insurance should be increased from $2,000 to $5,000 effective April 1, 1989. 3. Eligibility for Faculty Retiree Life Insurance: Eligibility for the TIAA Life Insurance program should be changed to cover retirees at least age 55 with five or more years of service if the sum of the age and service is 70 or greater. This change should be effective April 1, 1989. 4. Accidental Death and Dismemberment: University contributions to the program should be discontinued effective April 1, 1989.</field>
