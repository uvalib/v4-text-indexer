Whereas Lewis Commodore the faithful and valuable servant of this University, with the exception of Drunkeness, which had well nigh ruined him, having seen his error, &amp; for five months last past, maintained the steady and consistent course of a reformed man, be it therefore 1. Resolved, that the Proctor be requested, that during the vacations in future, Lewis shall not be required to work out in the grounds with the other laborers of the University, but be confined only to the performance of such a reduced portion of the duties of his station as the absence of the Students &amp; professors will permit, so long as the said Lewis Commodore faithfully maintains his pledge of total abstinence from all intoxicating drinks. The Committee of Inspection made a report accompanied by the following resolutions which were adopted. 2.

Resolved that so much of the report of the Committee of Finance as refers to the time up to which the annual accounts of the Bursar &amp; proctor should be stated be communicated to them respectively by the Secretary. 6. Resolved that so much of the report of the Committee of Finance, as directs the application by the Bursar of $2000 or less as there provided, to the extinguishment of as much of the debt of the University be communicated to him by the Secretary &amp; he is hereby requested to comply therewith. 7. Resolv'd that the sum of four hundred &amp; fifty dollars, being the interest for five years on the Legacy bequeathed by Mr. Madison to the University, be appropriated to the purchase of books of stanard Character &amp; permanent value, to be added to the Library: And Messrs.

Resolved that two thousand copies of the revised enactments reported to the Board by Professor Minor, under the resolution of last year, be printed in a pamphlet of convenient form, under the superintendence of that professor for the use of the University, &amp; the expenses of printing the same be defrayed by the Proctor. The Rector having submitted to the Board a letter from Alexander Garrett Esqr. on the subject of the late reduction ordered in the Commission allowed him as Bursar of the University It is 9. Resolved that the Rector be requested to communicate to him the sentiments of respect &amp; confidence entertained towards him as an officer of the Institution by the Board of Visitors, with an assurance that the reduction spoken of in his commission as Bursar was ordered as part only of general system of retrenchment in the expenses which the affairs of the University rendered necessary. 10.

Resolved that it shall be the duty of the proctor to make out a complete schedule of all the personal property belonging to the University, except the scientific apparatus, or other things appropriate to the schools of professors and under their charge, &amp; to return a copy of the same to the Visitors at each annual meeting. And the proctor is hereby directed to dispose of any stock belonging to the University, except such horses as may be required for it's use. 2. Resolved that the Proctor be authorised to purchase on fair and equitable terms, subject to the approval of the Executive Committee, the unexpired term in the lease to Wm. Dunkum for the land devised to the University by the late Martin Dawson decd., as preliminary to any contract for assigning the same to such person as may be engaged to board certain of the Students, under a resolution of the present Board. 3. Resolved that two receipts presented by the late Proctor Willis H. Woodley which he claims as not having been credited to him in consequence of their being mislaid viz: one for $37 14/100 dated Oct. 6th 1838 signed David Nimmo            the other for $11 72/100 dated Nov. 18th 1839 signed Ralph Dudley, be referred to the Commissioner and if it appears that the late Proctor has not been credited for these items on the Books, they be allowed him &amp; the proctor is hereby authorised &amp; requir to draw for the amount in his favor on the Bursar, provided they also receive the approbation of the Executive Committee. To diffuse as far as practicable through the State the benefits of education at the University and thereby to extend its usefulness, the Board of Visitors have determined to receive such number of meritorious young men at the Institution for gratuitous instruction as it's circumstances will admit, to be distributed equally with reference to the Senatorial Districts: 4. Resolved therefore that one Student from each Senatorial district, qualified to enter the University according to the enactments shall be received at each session hereafter, without payment of the Professors fees, &amp; without charge for any of the University dues, fines &amp; penalties excepted; &amp; that a sufficient number of Dormitories shall be appropriated to their use, assigning two to each Dormitory. (For the ensuing Academic year the selection shall be made by the Faculty upon such testimonials as may be laid before them on behalf of the applicants; hereafter in such manner as may be appointed by the Board of Visitors, unless otherwise directed by Law. In making such selection the Faculty shall regard as well the capacity, as the moral fitness of the Candidate, and shall have satisfactory evidence, that the applicant his parent or guardian is not in a situation to incur the expenses of his education.) Such Students when admitted shall stand in all respects on a footing with other Students of the University, and in assigning them their classes the Faculty shall regard the preferences they may indicate or the recommendation of judicious friends. The term of their admission shall be for two years, subject, as other students, to expulsion or dismission as well as to the minor punishments - But in cases of great proficiency, such term may be extended by the Visitors. Should vacancies occur, they will be filled at the first annual meeting of the Board thereafter: and notice of such vacancies shall be published in the Senatorial districts in which it may occur. And for the purpose of reducing as far as practicable the expenses of such Students it is 5. Resolved that the price of Board paid by them shall not exceed sixty dollars for the session; to effect which authority is hereby given to the proctor to make the following contract- He shall have power and is hereby directed to contract with some fit &amp; suitable person to board said Students, in the same manner and subject to the same regulations with the Hotel Keepers, at a price for each not exceeding sixty dollars for the session; for which sum the same accommodation is to be provided, as by the Hotel Keepers to Students, subject only to such modifications, should any be found necessary, as may be approved by the Faculty- Provided that sleeping apartments shall be furnished by the contractor to at least twelve of such Students- To enable the University to reduce the price of Board as above ordered, to such Students, the proctor is hereby authorised, in consideration of furnishing the same at such price to assign to the person contracted with, and for his use &amp; occupation the House &amp; land attached thereto, known as the proctor's house;- and also the land belonging to the University called the "Dawson Farm". And shall on behalf of the University enter into a written contract with such person, in nature of a lease, for the use and occupation by him of said House &amp; lands, for one year, to expire on the 1st day of August 1847- but with a covenant that such contract may be renewed from year to year by endorsement of such renewal thereon signed by the Proctor. Such contract shall provide for the Board of such Students, under the regulations above prescribed, at the price that may be agreed on not exceeding sixty dollars for each for the session. And it shall contain covenants on the part of the Contractor against all waste on the premises, for the preservation of fencing, &amp; for the return of the whole on the expiration of the term, in as good condition as received- But he shall have liberty to open or clear land by permission of the Executive Committee, &amp; to cut fire wood from the "Dawson Farm" for his own consumption; &amp; to take dead wood or wood cut in judicious thinning from the Proctor's Farm- The contract before it is executed to be approved by the Executive Committee. Should it happen that the full number of thirty two Students are not admitted, the proctor may allow the contractor to fill up that number from other Students at the same price of Board: but such additions shall not be exempt from the ordinary University dues: Applications for admission of such Students must be addressed to the Chairman of the Faculty, accompanied by such testimonials as the Candidate may offer. The Chairman shall prepare an advertisement embodying full information to such as may desire to enter the University under the foregoing regulations, announcing the same by order of the Board of Visitors, &amp; annexing to the same the probable cost of the necessary text books- Which advertisement, separate from the annual advertisement of the University shall be published for 4 weeks in the newspapers at Richmond, &amp; in one paper of most circulation in each Senatorial district- And hereafter for 4 weeks prior to each annual meeting of the Board of Visitors. 6. Resolved that the professor of Law shall be allowed to give opinions or advice in any professional matter. The Rector absented himself from the Board when it was unanimously 7. Resolved that Doct: James L. Cabell be appointed Chairman of the Faculty for the ensuing year. That portion of the preceding scheme, for the education of State pupils, in the 4th resolution which is placed between brackets (   ) commencing with "For the ensuing academic year" &amp; ending with "expenses of education", was moved by Mr. Stevenson, to be stricken out and the following substitute inserted, which, being rejected by the Board, was directed, at his request to be spread upon the record, in the following words viz: The first selection shall be made in the following manner - The counties composing each senatorial District shall be arranged by lot into classes according to the number of the counties composing such District. The first admission shall be from the County drawing No.1 &amp; the succeeding admissions from the other Counties of each Senatorial district in rotation, &amp; in case there should be no applicant from the county entitled to make it, then the selection may be made from the next county in the district entitled to precedence. And the selections &amp; recommendations shall in all cases be made by the school commissioners of the Counties within which the applications may reside. In making such selections the Board of Visitors would respectfully recommend to the appointing power the expediency of regarding as well the capacity as the moral fitness of the applicant, &amp; upon satisfactory evidence that the parent or guardian of the nominee is not in a situation to incur the expenses of his education. It shall be the duty of the Faculty to arrange the Counties of each Senatorial District into lots, and publish the same in the advertisement directed to be made by a previous resolution of the Board. The Board then adjourned sine die.</field>
