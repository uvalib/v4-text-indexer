Whereas, all present recognized the fact that a new medical center would provide the most desirable modern institution, the assembled Committee is of the unanimous opinion that without substantial supplementary funds a new construction is not justified. 2. Whereas the Committee has been assured by Dr. Lippard that a modern functional institution can be developed at the present location by increasing capacity, by providing additional equipment, and by disposing of outmoded sections to be replaced by a new building, so constructed that there may be future expansion through superimposing additional floors, the Committee recommends the approval of the request for $9,000,000 for capital outlay for the development of the present Hospital and Medical School in the following stages: A. Development of Ward Building, increasing the capacity by 250 beds, at a roughly estimated cost of $3,500,000. B. Development of a central diagnostic service unit, including Out-Patient Department, X-Ray Department, central Clinical Pathology and Laboratories, at a roughly estimated cost of $5,000,000. C. Additional unit in the Medical School Building. General expansion of class rooms and laboratories for pre-clinical medical sciences, at a roughly estimated cost of $1,000,000. Presuming that the instruction as to a report on maintenance was related to the new medical center, the Committee is making no report on maintenance, other than the suggestion that the general question of maintenance may be deserving of further study The Committee Hugh H. Trout, Sr., M.D. Frank Talbott, Jr. Mrs. Herbert McK. Smith, Chairman TUITION AND FEES The Bursar presented data showing tuition at other universities requested by the Board at its previous meeting, namely, University of Alabama, Harvard University, University of Maryland, University of North Carolina, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, Tulane University, Washington and Lee University, and Yale University. He presented also a study of instructional costs in the several departments of the University. After careful consideration, the Board approved the following schedule of increases in tuition and fees, to be effective in September 1950 SCHEDULE OF TUITION CHANGES EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 1950 Tuition for Non-Virginians Department Tuition 1949-50 Tuition 1950-51 College $350 $450 Medicine 600 800(a) (a) Tuition limited to $700 for 1950-51 third and fourth year classes until graduation Engineering 350 450 Education 350 450 Education 275 450 Tuition for Virginians* * Increases in tuition for Virginia students are in lieu of laboratory fees Department Tuition 1949-50 Tuition 1950-51 Medicine $350 $400(b) (b) Tuition limited to $350 for 1950-51 third and fourth year classes until graduation College 150 160 Engineering 200 210 ALL LABORATORY FEES ARE TO BE ABOLISHED. THE STUDENT HEALTH FEE WILL BE INCREASED TO $20.00 PER SESSION. Law School Tuition Action on an increase in tuition in the Department of Law was deferred until after a conference between the President and the Law Alumni Association, scheduled for Friday, November 18. The President was authorized, after this conference, to increase the Law School tuition if he deemed it advisable. Mr. Darden asked for an expression of opinion by the Board concerning the advisability of increasing this tuition, and it was the sense of the Board that the non-resident tuition in the Department of Law should be increased by $100 APPOINTMENT OF INSTRUCTORS A resolution was adopted authorizing the President to appoint instructors without securing the approval of the Board DEFINITION OF VIRGINIA STUDENT The attention of the Board was directed to several cases in which certain students who, it was believed, should be classified as Virginians were excluded from such status under present regulations of the University. Because of the importance of this matter, it was deemed advisable to appoint a special committee to study the problem and make recommendations to the Board. The Rector was requested to appoint such a committee CHRISTOPHER G. MEMMINGER FUND The Rector was requested to write to the nearest Memminger relative and the trustees of the Memminger Estate, expressing the appreciation of the University for the handsome gift NCAA REGULATIONS A mimeographed report prepared by Captain Pritchett on the NCAA Regulations with a proposed statement to be submitted by the University was distributed to the members of the Board. After discussion of this document and other related problems, a resolution was adopted requesting the Athletics Committee to prepare a proposed amendment to the NCAA Code which would authorize scholarships sufficient in amount to cover room, board, tuition and fees, and books for each recipient. The Athletic Committee was requested to prepare the University's case for submission to the NCAA meeting in January, and to join with the President in attending this meeting. A further resolution was adopted requesting the Athletic Committee to associate with it Captain Pritchett, Mr. Nicholas P. Wilson, and Mr. Gus Tebell. The Board requested this group to visit other institutions in this section of the United States and ascertain whether or not they would support an amendment to the NCAA Constitution, enlarging the scope of the scholarships authorized to include room, board, tuition and fees, and books President Darden stated that he would be leaving for India about the first of December and would be unable to assist the committee in the preparation of the University's case, but he would join them in New York upon his return and assist in every way possible in presenting the matter to the NCAA meeting DECEMBER BOARD MEETING The Board adopted a resolution to hold the December meeting at a place and time to be determined by the Rector, the place to be Fredericksburg if possible -â-â- On motion the meeting then adjourned Barron F.
