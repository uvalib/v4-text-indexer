      <field name="fulltext">REPORT BY THE PRESIDENT The President distributed a draft of an "Institutional Profile" document containing a wealth of information about the University. He explained that this draft was edited by Nancy Tramontin. He expressed his thanks for an outstanding effort. He spoke of the academic process which the University is now following, and advised the Board that drafts of the planning documents will come to the Board at the March meeting, following which these may be further refined. Dr. Detmer and Mr. Kelly and members of the staff are already working intensely on the document which he anticipates will be superb. The President told the Board that he, the Rector, Mrs. Morie, and other University officials had visited residential colleges at Yale and at Harvard Universities. In examining these, he was impressed by the academic importance of these colleges. He noted that the Master of one of these is usually a scholar with established credentials. He pointed out that the commons rooms for faculty and students are essential to the intellectual life of the college. It was his observation that the arrangements for the colleges are not idyllic or perfect, and that they tend to pose some problems, but that the value of the colleges far outweighed the problems that they pose. Mr. Casteen reported that the group came away from the visit with the impression that setting up residential colleges here is feasible, and that we can identify currently available houses which can be converted to structures that will house residential colleges. He noted that the challenges to what one might call the University's culture will be great. At both Harvard and Yale, the first year students live together as they do at the University of Virginia, however after the first year the students at Harvard and Yale continue to be housed together in the same quarters for three years. He noted that at the University of Virginia we do not have available housing on the grounds for all of the undergraduate students. He also pointed out that here we find a culture where a large number of students reside in fraternity or sorority houses, and that some students enjoy the experience of living in apartments off grounds during some part of their undergraduate experience. He advised the Board that he is in contact with other universities that have good residential college programs, and that conversations with our deans are underway. When these are completed, he said, there will be further reports about residential colleges to the Board of Visitors. He noted that we have a lot of work to do in this area. The President concluded his remarks by stating that he is greatly impressed by the success of Monroe Hill College, and interest that has been shown in it.</field>

Continued use of the facilities beyond the five year period, if Forestry's new facilities have not been completed, will be the subject of future negotiations. 2. The University agrees to provide financial support to Forestry for construction costs of the headquarters office building and administrative support facility as follows: a. A ixed amount of $1.1 million will be provided to compensate for additional site development costs required by the change from the original project site to the Hillcrest site, and inflation in the building tion resulting from a delay of approximately fifteen months in completion of contract documents for the work as a result of the changed site. This amount represents the full and only commitment of the University to increased construction costs for the project resulting from the change in site. b. The University will make an additional payment of $1.4 million reflecting the balance of a commitment to purchase the existing Forestry site south of Charlottesville for $1.5 million. c. The $3.5 million total of the foregoing commitments will be transferred by the University to Forestry at the time bids are received and a construction contract awarded in the Fall of 1990. d. If contract bidding and an award of a construction contract are delayed for any reason, the University will deposit the total commitment of $2.5 million into an escrow account no later than October 15, 1990.This escrow amount, and any accrued intoroct will be everting and available solely to Forestry to be used for construction of the headquarters office building and administrative support facility should the project proceed at any time during a five year-period following October 15, 1990.It is the intent of the parties, in setting up the escrow account, that principal and interest be dedicated to and expended solely for construction of the Department of Forestry's new headquarters office building and administrative support facility at the Hillcrest site, should that project proceed at any time during a five-year period commencing October 15, 1990.If, after five years of establishment of the escrow account, the project has not proceeded into construction, the escrowed amount and all accrued interests will revert to the University. If construction has not commenced at the Hillcrest site before October 14, 1995, then the escrowed amount together with all accrued interest will revert to the University. 3. Forestry agrees that it will utilize the land and financial resources provided by the University for the purpose of constructing the headquarters office building and administive support facility, and that upon completion of these facilities, all existing facilities and property adjacent to Alderman and McCormick Roads on the grounds of the University will be relinquished to the University without additional compensation.
