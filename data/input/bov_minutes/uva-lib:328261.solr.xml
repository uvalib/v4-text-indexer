Mr. Scott, of the Committee on Heating, stated that a meeting of the Committee was held in Richmond, at which Dr. Lambeth, Mr. Willis and Mr. Almirall were also present, and that it was practically the unanimous opinion of the meeting that a tunnel should be built this summer and that the plants be consolidated, but that it was yet a question whether or not, in view of the excessive cost of building, the work should be postponed. The Rector was authorized to appoint a committee of three, of which he should be one, to employ an engineer to draw plans and specifications for the heating plant, and a committee of two from the faculty to advise with them. The scholarship offer from the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity, as per the following communication, was accepted with the thanks of the Board: June 9, 1920. Rector and Visitors, University of Virginia - Greeting: The supreme Council of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity most gratefully accept the privilege of petitioning your Honorable Board for the privilege of offering the use of Room 31, West Range, the birth-place of our beloved Fraternity, as a scholarship to deserving members of its organization. If granted this privilege, the Fraternity agrees to pay to the University the sum of EIGHTY SEVEN DOLLARS as a yearly rental, including light, heat, and attendance for the combined Summer and Winter Sessions. In offering this scholarship it is the intent and purpose of the Fraternity not only to have the occupant of this room conduct himself as a keeper of a shrine, but also to stimulate a greater interest in the Institution held in such high esteem by all members of our organization. In the event no member of the Fraternity attending the University avails himself of this privilege, the Fraternity will endeavor to guarantee the occupancy of this room by a bona fide student of the University. In witness thereof the supreme Council has signed its name and affixed its seal the day above written. Supreme Council, Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity by Robert A. Symthe, Business Manager. J. Lorton Francis, Grand Secretary. The Rector was authorized to appoint a committee from the members of the Board on University Extension. On motion of Mr. Scott, a scholarship to be known as a Memorial Scholarship was created for the year 1920-21 with the value of $300, and the same was awarded to Mr. R. Carter Scott, Jrs., of Richmond, Va. Upon the recommendation of the President, it was RESOLVED, That the new Chemical Laboratory be named "The John B. Cobb Chemical Laboratory". Upon motion the meeting then adjourned until June 15th, at 9 o'clock. [signed] E, I. Carruthers Secretary. [signed] John Stewart Bryan Rector University, Virginia. June 15, 1920. An adjourned meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date with the following members present: Rector Bryan, and Visitors Walker, Dillard, Duke, Hatton, Robertson, Scott and Oliver. The following reports of the Committee on Buildings and Grounds in the matter of the Beta Theta Pi application for permission to erect a fraternity house on the grounds of the University, and the application of Prof. C. M. Sparrow to make certain changes in the Monroe Hill rooms now occupied by him, as set forth in his letter of June 7, 1920 to the President, were approved: The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. The Committee on Buildings and Grounds, to which was referred the application of the Beta Theta Pi for permission to erect a fraternity house on the grounds of the University, recommends that the fraternity be given an option until January 1, 1921 on the lot in the rear of the Kappa Sigma House and fronting on Rugby Road, for the erection of such house. The exact bounds of said lot to be hereafter determined by the Rector and Visitors, and the terms and conditions upon which said lot is to be held and the building erected to be in accordance with those heretofore determined by the Rector and Visitors in other like cases. In case the lot be desired by the fraternity, then the details shall be arranged and embodied in proper documents to be duly executed by the parties. Respectfully submitted, G. Hatton Alex. Robertson H. D. Dillard. The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. The Committee on Buildings and Grounds unanimously recommends that the application of Prof. C. M. Sparrow, as set forth in his letter of June 7, 1920 to the President, be rejected, and the Committee is unable to make any recommendation which will provide for the remodeling or repairing of the property at this time. The Committee is of the opinion that it is unwise and inexpedient to permit any professor to remodel or repair any building belonging to the University at the expense of such professor with a stipulation that such professor be reimbursed by the University at any future time. The Committee further reports that the present system of valuation at which the various pavilions or residences are let to the professors should be revised and the buildings be valued before any general system of housing can be put into effect. Respectfully submitted, H. D. Dillard Alex. F. Robertson G. Hatton The Committee on Buildings and Grounds was requested to investigate the matter of rent of University residences occupied by professors and report to the Board. In the matter of furnishing bond by the University for the withdrawal of tax-free alchol for use of the University Hospital, the following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED, That the Rector, John Stewart Bryan, be and is hereby authorized on behalf of the Rector and Visitors to sign a bond for the withdrawal of alchol, free of tax, for use of the University Hospital, and also to sign application for the withdrawal of alchol, free of tax, for use of said Hospital. The meeting then adjourned. [signed] John Stewart Bryan Rector. [signed] E. I. Carruthers Secretary.</field>
