ATHLETICS Mr. Black read a letter which he had sent to Mr. Hatcher concerning the control of athletics by the Board of Visitors. The Secretary was asked to distribute copies of this letter to the members of the Board. HOSPITAL In accordance with instructions of the Board at the last regular meeting, the President reported that he had talked to the Governor concerning the projected deficit in the operation of the hospital for the current year. The Governor had stated that he felt that a part of the hospital should be closed only as a last resort. The Governor has asked the State Auditor of Public Accounts to make a comparative study of the operating cost of the University Hospital with the Medical College Hospital. Upon completion of this study the Governor will decide to what extent a deficit authorization should be made. Mr. Gay inquired if this was a solution to the problem or only temporary relief. The President stated that this was only a temporary solution, but that the Governor planned to take up the matter at the next session of the Legislature. Mr. Gay stated that he would not like to see the hospital separated from the University but he thought it was important that the Legislature recognize that the care of indigents is a public health function. Under date of June 4, 1952, Governor Battle wrote The Rector and members of the Board, pointing out the responsibility of the Board should a deficit be incurred in the operation of the institution. The Rector's reply to the Governor's letter is set forth below, together with the response of the Governor. June 5, 1952 Honorable John S. Battle Governor, State of Virginia Richmond, Virginia Dear John: I acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 4, 1952, addressed to the members of the governing boards and to the heads of all State institutions and agencies, informing them of the provisions of the law regarding exceeding appropriations which have been allocated to the different State agencies, and warning the members of these governing boards that a certain prescribed procedure must be followed for additional appropriations. Pursuant to your letter, I this morning talked to Colgate W. Darden, Jr., about our situation at the University and have been informed by him what I already knew from my own knowledge to be the fact, that we have not exceeded any of the appropriations made for us unless your written consent has been obtained. There is a single exception to this situation which I think ought to be brought to your notice, and about which I think you are already informed. I refer to the University of Virginia Hospital situation. We have labored long and hard to control expenditures of this situation. The reason we have not been successful is that the hospital is burdened with a great number of indigent cases sent to the hospital mostly by the adjoining counties of Albemarle, Greene and the cities of Charlottesville and Staunton. It is impossible for us to turn away meritorious cases in a State institution. Full advantage of our weakness in this respect is taken by other institutions and municipalities. As a result, the University of Virginia Hospital is exceeding the appropriation made for it. I see no way that the situation can be controlled nor do I think that any official of the University of Virginia or any member of the Board of Visitors should be held responsible for this. Actually, the State of Virginia is contributing to defray the expenses of those who are ill and sick and who cannot pay for their hospital services. I wish I knew the answer to this situation, but of one thing I am certain, and that is the fault should not be laid at our door. The only connection of the hospital with the University of Virginia, as you know, is that it provides a means of assisting in the education of young doctors. In doing this, it provides an absolutely essential thing for medical education. Yet it has developed into what is really a State health center, and I sometimes wonder whether the University of Virginia Board of Visitors should be charged with the running of such an institution. Please excuse me for going into the details of this situation, but I do not see how I could answer your letter without calling your attention to the situation which exists in the hospital. With my kind regards to you, Sincerely yours, /s/ Barron F. Black BFB:n Honorable Barron F. Black 819 Citizens Bank Building Norfolk, Virginia Dear Barron: Thank you for your favor of June fifth. I appreciate your writing me so fully on the subject outlined in your letter and, of course, am familiar with the situation. With my personal regards and every good wish, I am Cordially yours, /s/ John S. Battle At its last meeting the Board asked the President to discuss the projected deficit with the Governor and request instructions. In accordance with the direction of the Governor, the hospital is being operated at a deficit, pending the completion of a study of operation cost by the State Auditor of Public Accounts. UNCOLLECTIBLE HOSPITAL ACCOUNTS In view of the above action, the Board adopted the following resolution: RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts schedules 310, 313, and 314, aggregating $29,872.96, recommended to them for cancellation. ATHLETIC COMMITTEE REPORT Mr. Talbott, Chairman of the Athletic Committee, read the report of his committee, as set forth below: TO THE BOARD OF VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: At a meeting of the Board held December 14, 1951, the following resolution was adopted: "BE IT RESOLVED that the Rector be asked to appoint a committee of the Board to study the type of organization which should be established for the control of athletics." The undersigned constitute the committee appointed by the Rector pursuant to this resolution. In the discharge of its functions the Committee has had the benefit of all recorded actions by faculty and other groups interested in the problem and has given careful consideration to and, in many respects has profited by, their views and recommendations. The White Committee, which reported to the President of the University in December, 1934, recommended institutional control of inter-collegiate athletics, intramural sports and physical education. We understand that this fundamental principle has prevailed in theory since the White report was approved, but that changing conditions have brought about some changes in administrative functions. Furthermore, in our opinion, present circumstances make it advisable to specify more particularly the functions of an Advisory Council as set up in the White Report, now known as the 3-3-3 Committee. Since the death of Captain Pritchett, the Director of the Department of Athletics has not held faculty status. We approve the fundamental principle stated in the White report. We believe that the institutional control therein recommended is the proper form of control to be exercised over the Department of Athletics. In order to implement this principle, we recommend the following: (1) That responsibility for administration of the Department of Athletics shall be placed on a Director of Athletics, who shall have faculty status and the pay of a Department Head, and that the Director shall be responsible to the President of the University. (2) That the faculty shall, as heretofore, have the responsibility of setting the standards required for the maintenance of acceptable academic standing for students in general, that students who maintain such standards shall be eligible to represent the University in athletic competition, subject to such regulations as may be established by the administrative authorities of the University, including the Board of Visitors, regarding eligibility in respects other than that of acceptable academic standing. The policy of the University concerning scholarships which may be awarded to students who participate in inter-collegiate athletics is reserved for decision by the Board of Visitors, which will act, of course, with the benefit of recommendations from the administrative authorities and the Advisory Council hereinafter mentioned. (3) That an Advisory Council on Athletics be established which shall consist of (a) Three members from the Faculty, appointed by the President. (b) Two members from the Alumni Association, elected by its Board of Managers, and (c) Two members from the Student Body, elected by the Student Council, that this Advisory Council shall be authorized to select its own Chairman and to adopt rules or regulations governing its sessions and the transaction of its business; that the Advisory Council shall be required to meet once in each calendar quarter and at such additional times as may appear necessary, on call of its chairman or of the Director of Athletics, that the Director of Athletics shall be required to report to the Council at each meeting concerning his administration of the Department and to suggest to the Council for its discussion and for advisory action any questions then existing or anticipated by the Director as likely to arise prior to the next regularly scheduled Council meeting, that this Council shall have the function of advising with the Director of Athletics concerning all major decisions affecting the administration of his Department, of referring to the Board of Visitors for its consideration questions of policy deemed by the Council to be appropriate for Board action, and of recommending to the Board of Visitors action on any question concerning the Department referred by the Board to the Council. (4) That the administration of the Department of Athletics shall be under the supervision of the President and administrative authorities of the University, and that decision on all questions involved in its operation shall, as in other phases of the University's activities, be subject to review and final determination by the Board of Visitors. Respectfully submitted, /s/ Thomas B. Gay /s/ Whitwell W. Coxe /s/ Benj. W. Mears /s/ Frank Talbott, Jr. October 10, 1952 After the report was read and discussed, a resolution was adopted as follows RESOLVED that the report of the Athletic Committee be received and filed. The Secretary was instructed to mimeograph the report and distribute copies, (1) to members of the Board of Visitors, (2) to the President of the University, (3) to the Secretary of the University Senate, (4) to the President of the Student Council, (5) to the President of the Alumni Association, and (6) to the President of the Student Aid Foundation, together with a letter from the Secretary requesting the President of the Alumni Association to solicit the views of the organized Alumni chapters for presentation to the Board, also to state that the Board will hold a special meeting upon a date to be set at which the Alumni will be heard. The Secretary was asked to send a copy of the University Senate's recommendations on the control of athletics to the President of the Alumni Association, the President of the Student Council, and to the President of the Student Aid Foundation. The Board also wished to record a vote of thanks to the Athletic Committee for its work in preparing this report. ADMISSIONS POLICY The President reported that there had been no change in admission requirements but a change in machinery for handling admissions. A committee which he had set up for this purpose is completing its first year's work and is in the process of preparing a report which he will present to the Board at its next meeting. ASSIGNMENT OF LAWN HOUSES The President stated that he had received a letter from Dean Lewis concerning a change in policy in assignment of Lawn houses. The letter was referred to the Buildings and Grounds Committee. ADMISSION OF WOMEN At the June meeting of the Board the President and Secretary were asked to draft an appropriate resolution for submission at the July meeting to provide for the admission of daughters of faculty members to the College of Arts and Sciences. Prior to the July meeting, the President was asked to secure the opinion of members of the Alumni Board of Managers concerning this matter, and also have the Secretary write various institutions who do not normally admit women, concerning their policy on the admission of daughters of faculty members. The vote of the Alumni Board of Managers was 7 for the admission of daughters of faculty members and 8 against, with one member not heard from. After discussion of the matter, the Board adopted the following resolution: RESOLVED that the daughters of faculty members who live in the homes of their families in Charlottesville, be admitted to the College of Arts and Sciences. Mr. Talbott and Mr. Gay asked to be recorded as voting against the above resolution. -â-â-â-â-â- On motion the meeting was then adjourned. Barron F.

I wish I knew the answer to this situation, but of one thing I am certain, and that is the fault should not be laid at our door. The only connection of the hospital with the University of Virginia, as you know, is that it provides a means of assisting in the education of young doctors. In doing this, it provides an absolutely essential thing for medical education. Yet it has developed into what is really a State health center, and I sometimes wonder whether the University of Virginia Board of Visitors should be charged with the running of such an institution. Please excuse me for going into the details of this situation, but I do not see how I could answer your letter without calling your attention to the situation which exists in the hospital. With my kind regards to you, Sincerely yours, /s/ Barron F. Black BFB:n</field>

      <field name="fulltext">TO THE BOARD OF VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: At a meeting of the Board held December 14, 1951, the following resolution was adopted: "BE IT RESOLVED that the Rector be asked to appoint a committee of the Board to study the type of organization which should be established for the control of athletics." The undersigned constitute the committee appointed by the Rector pursuant to this resolution. In the discharge of its functions the Committee has had the benefit of all recorded actions by faculty and other groups interested in the problem and has given careful consideration to and, in many respects has profited by, their views and recommendations. The White Committee, which reported to the President of the University in December, 1934, recommended institutional control of inter-collegiate athletics, intramural sports and physical education. We understand that this fundamental principle has prevailed in theory since the White report was approved, but that changing conditions have brought about some changes in administrative functions. Furthermore, in our opinion, present circumstances make it advisable to specify more particularly the functions of an Advisory Council as set up in the White Report, now known as the 3-3-3 Committee. Since the death of Captain Pritchett, the Director of the Department of Athletics has not held faculty status. We approve the fundamental principle stated in the White report. We believe that the institutional control therein recommended is the proper form of control to be exercised over the Department of Athletics. In order to implement this principle, we recommend the following: (1) That responsibility for administration of the Department of Athletics shall be placed on a Director of Athletics, who shall have faculty status and the pay of a Department Head, and that the Director shall be responsible to the President of the University. (2) That the faculty shall, as heretofore, have the responsibility of setting the standards required for the maintenance of acceptable academic standing for students in general, that students who maintain such standards shall be eligible to represent the University in athletic competition, subject to such regulations as may be established by the administrative authorities of the University, including the Board of Visitors, regarding eligibility in respects other than that of acceptable academic standing. The policy of the University concerning scholarships which may be awarded to students who participate in inter-collegiate athletics is reserved for decision by the Board of Visitors, which will act, of course, with the benefit of recommendations from the administrative authorities and the Advisory Council hereinafter mentioned. (3) That an Advisory Council on Athletics be established which shall consist of (a) Three members from the Faculty, appointed by the President. (b) Two members from the Alumni Association, elected by its Board of Managers, and (c) Two members from the Student Body, elected by the Student Council, that this Advisory Council shall be authorized to select its own Chairman and to adopt rules or regulations governing its sessions and the transaction of its business; that the Advisory Council shall be required to meet once in each calendar quarter and at such additional times as may appear necessary, on call of its chairman or of the Director of Athletics, that the Director of Athletics shall be required to report to the Council at each meeting concerning his administration of the Department and to suggest to the Council for its discussion and for advisory action any questions then existing or anticipated by the Director as likely to arise prior to the next regularly scheduled Council meeting, that this Council shall have the function of advising with the Director of Athletics concerning all major decisions affecting the administration of his Department, of referring to the Board of Visitors for its consideration questions of policy deemed by the Council to be appropriate for Board action, and of recommending to the Board of Visitors action on any question concerning the Department referred by the Board to the Council. (4) That the administration of the Department of Athletics shall be under the supervision of the President and administrative authorities of the University, and that decision on all questions involved in its operation shall, as in other phases of the University's activities, be subject to review and final determination by the Board of Visitors. Respectfully submitted, /s/ Thomas B. Gay /s/ Whitwell W. Coxe /s/ Benj. W. Mears /s/ Frank Talbott, Jr. October 10, 1952</field>
