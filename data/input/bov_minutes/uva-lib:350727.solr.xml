Richardson, Jr., as co-executor of the estate. A $5,000 legacy to Mr. Richardson was added later, but no clause was included reciting that the $5,000 legacy was to be in addition to Mr. Richardson's commission as executor. Mr. Vincent's widow and attorneys feel that this omission was an oversight. The other residuary legatees, Tulane University and Trinity Church, have approved payment of the $5,000 legacy plus commission to Mr. Richardson. Mr. Darden recommended that similar action be taken by this Board. Whereupon it was so resolved. BIENNIAL BUDGET REQUESTS 1952-54 Budget requests for the biennium 1952-54, which had been reviewed and approved by the Finance Committee on September 13, were submitted to the Board. The operating budget for the biennium calls for expenditure of $11,963,526 for maintenance and operation of the University and for $1,765,000 for capital outlays. Requests for the Hospital Division totaled $5,733,808 for maintenance and operation for the biennium and $2,000,000 for capital outlays. These requests were approved by the Board. APPOINTMENT OF DR. LAWSON The Board approved an annual salary of $2,500 to Dr. George M. Lawson for research work in Medicine, effective at the start of the session 1951-52. ESTATE OF WILLIAM J. HUMPHREYS Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, recommended payment of attorneys' fees of $3,002.38 to the Huntington, West Virginia, firm of Fitzpatrick, Strickling, Marshall and Huddleston for services in connection with settlement of the estate of William J. Humphreys. The Board approved payment of the fees as recommended by Mr. Perkins, to be charged against the account for the Estate of William J. Humphreys, deceased APPOINTMENT OF PROFESSOR BARR Mr. Talbott read a letter from Professor Wright of the School of Economics stating that Professor Stringfellow Barr, recently appointed to the Political Science faculty, was listed as a member of several communist front organizations. Mr. Wright inquired if the Board had investigated Mr. Barr's status at the time of his appointment Mr. Gay suggested that inquiry be made of Mr. Wright as to whether he wished to bring charges before the Board that Professor Barr is a communist. A copy of Professor Wright's letter to the Board of June, 1951, was read, in which Professor Wright states: "Dr. Barr is not in my opinion, consciously or in intent a communist." However, he also states: ". . . Dr. Barr has been described both in books and on the radio as having been a member of at least two communist front organizations. Certainly, it would seem, these charges deserve at least some investigation." Whereupon a resolution was adopted requesting the Rector to write Mr. Wright and call attention to Mr. Wright's letter to the Board of June, 1951, and inquire of Professor Wright if he wished to bring charges before the Board that Mr. Barr is a communist. PROGRAM FOR HISTORY 17-18 Mr. Black read the following letter from Professor Wright. September 11, 1951 President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. University of Virginia Charlottesville, Virginia Dear Sir: I was informed this morning by Mr. Gooch that he understood that Dr. Snavely had said that the question of approval or nonapproval of Mr. Barr's course had been discussed in our faculty and that we had voted to approve. I wish to say that this is entirely untrue. We have had no meetings on the question of approval or nonapproval and, as Mr. Barr has not had the courtesy to submit to us his reading list, we are not in a position to decide one way or the other. I am very sorry to have to raise the issue which I sincerely hoped would have been avoided, but I am obliged to point out that as things stand now there is no authority for the teaching of History 16 and 17 unless the Board of Visitors is willing to override the faculty and set up the course on its own authority. May I say how deeply I regret this incident which could have been so easily avoided. Yours very truly, (signed) David Wright David McCord Wright The President stated that he had replied to Mr. Wright's letter, and read his reply. After discussion it developed as the sense of the Board that faculty approval of the proposed course of instruction to be given under Mr. Barr's direction should be given according to established faculty procedure, and Mr. Darden was requested to determine whether this had been done and to correct the situation if the customary faculty procedure has not been followed. RICHEY MATTER President Darden stated that he came to the conclusion, prior to the appointment of Mr. Gange, that because of the limited funds available in the Woodrow Wilson School of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Richey should not be promoted to a position which would give him academic tenure. He stated that he had waited until Mr. Gange had been here a year before any action was taken concerning the faculty of the Woodrow Wilson School. After discussion of the matter the following resolution was adopted. The matters arising upon Mr. Richey's petition filed with Members of the Board in respect to which the Board has held four hearings at which Professors Richey, Gange, Fernbach and Micaud, and certain students, have been heard and their views fully considered, it was upon motion, duly made and seconded RESOLVED, that the petition of Mr. Richey that he be elevated to a full professorship and that Mr. Gange be dismissed from the faculty of the Woodrow Wilson School of Foreign Affairs be denied; that the evidence adduced in support of the petition does not warrant the action demanded, that the Board finds no evidence justifying the conclusions stated by Mr. Richey concerning the professional qualifications and fitness of his associates on the faculty, and that the Board appoint a sub-committee consisting of three members of the Board to record its reasons for this action. MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE MATTERS Dr. M. L. Combs and Mr. E. E. Woodward, Bursar, were present for discussion of the following matters. ELECTIONS The following elections were approved. Miss Guenndolyn A. Beeler as Acting Professor of Home Economics at a salary of $5,200 for the session of nine months, incumbency to begin September 17, 1951. This appointment is to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Dr. Alice Edwards. Miss Sallie B. Harrison as Acting Associate Professor of Home Economics at a salary of $4,200 for the session of nine months, incumbency to begin September 17, 1951. REPORT OF MARY WASHINGTON COMMITTEE The report of the Mary Washington Committee was presented by the Chairman, Mrs. Wailes, with action by the Board as noted below. September 14, 1951 The Mary Washington Committee met at Mary Washington College on August 30th, 1951 with all members present. Meeting with the group were President Combs and Mr. Woodward, college Treasurer. Student Accident Insurance At its July meeting the Board referred the matter of group accident insurance for Mary Washington students to the Mary Washington Committee with power to act. Since the Student Accident Medical Reimbursement Plan of the Indemnity Insurance Company of America had operated successfully for Mary Washington students last year, and since time for investigating thoroughly possible alternatives was limited, the committee decided to continue the above plan with James A. Scott and Son, Inc., for the coming year. However, the committee asked for deletion of postscript in the proposed letter to parents of students: "P.S. The above-mentioned plan is the only plan which has received the approval of the Board of Visitors of Mary Washington College for the year 1951-52." Approval of this plan does not bar any other company from securing such business. The committee would like to study the whole matter of group accident insurance for Mary Washington students during the spring of 1952. Biennial Budget 1952-54 The committee considered the biennial budget of the college, and while several questions were raised concerned specific items, such as proposed faculty salaries, the committee recommends its approval by the Board. The requests for capital outlay - for a science building and for a dormitory to relieve congestion have been approved previously by the Board, and conditional appropriations were made for both. The need for them is still acute A petition addressed to Governor Battle and signed by about sixty members of the faculty was presented to the committee by President Combs. The petition is a request for "a cost of living salary increase commensurate with that which was recently allotted to certain other State employees." The petition has been turned over to the Rector. (This budget was approved by the Board, with the exception of Dr. Combs' salary, which was left unchanged. A salary increase was recommended by the Board for the Mary Washington faculty as it was for the University of Virginia faculty.) Degree Program in Medical Technology The Board at its meeting on July 13, 1951, approved a cooperative program for the training of medical technologists by Mary Washington College and the University of Virginia leading to the B.S. degree to the awarded by Mary Washington College The Committee offers an amendment to the motion, viz., that on completion of the required courses and laboratory work the degree of Bachelor of Science in Medical Technology be awarded by Mary Washington College, and asks that the suggestion for the change be referred to the faculties concerned. (The change suggested by the Committee was approved by the Board.) Degree Program in Physical Therapy The committee recommends for approval by the Board the cooperative program in physical therapy worked out between Mary Washington College and the Medical College of Virginia leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy to be awarded by Mary Washington College upon successful completion of the requirements. (The following resolution was adopted. RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mary Washington College, in cooperation with the Medical College of Virginia, be and is hereby authorized to offer courses leading to the degree of B.S. in Physical Therapy effective for the session 1951-52, in accordance with the program outline presented to the Board.) Admission of Male Student The Committee considered a request from Mr. John F. Barrett, a druggist and resident of Fredericksburg for the past ten years, for permission to pursue certain courses at Mary Washington College which would enable him to get a B.S. degree in Pharmacy at the University of Pittsburgh. These courses are prerequisite to his final year in pharmacy. He is a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh and is qualified for admission to Mary Washington. The support of a family of nine children has made it impossible for him to take the necessary work elsewhere. The Committee recommends that applications of this kind be considered by the Board on their individual merits and that Mr. Barrett be permitted to take the necessary courses at Mary Washington. This recommendation has the approval of President Combs and Dean Alvey. (The Board approved Mr. Barrett's enrollment at Mary Washington College, subject to investigation by Mr. Perkins of the legality of such admission A report was received later in the day from Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, stating that under Virginia statute the Board did not have authority to admit Mr. Barrett to Mary Washington College.) Admission of Negro Students A questionnaire addressed to President Combs from the Virginia Teachers Association's Commission on Democracy in the Schools concerning admission of Negroes to Mary Washington College was referred to the Rector for disposition. (Mr. Howard stated that the other women's colleges had received similar letters and had referred them to the Attorney-General. Accordingly, the matter was referred to the AttorneyGeneral.) DISTRIBUTION OF STUDENT FEES The following resolution was adopted. RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mary Washington College be and is hereby authorized to reduce the laundry fee from $18 to $12 for the session of nine months and to increase the student activity fee proportionately from $12 to $18 for the session of nine months, effective 1951-52. CIVILIAN DEFENSE President Darden reported that he had received a letter from Civilian Defense officials requesting that Mary Washington College be designated as an evacuation center for the city of Washington in case of atomic attack. The President stated that he had advised the officials that the decision rested with the Governor, who would have to fit the request in with the needs of the State. -â-â-â-â-â- On motion, the meeting was then adjourned.
