I. du Pont de Nemours Company. After consulting with Messrs. Gray and Talbott, Mr. Mears had directed the Bank to retain all of the du Pont stocks. The Committee had been moved in part, Mr. Mears said, by a high regard for du Pont stocks as investment property and confidence in the current favorable outlook for these stocks, and in part out of courtesy to the du Pont family who donated these securities to the University. Mr. Mears requested the Board's opinion on (1) the current decision of the Finance Committee and (2) the policy to be followed in regard to du Pont stocks. After extensive discussion the Board adopted the following resolution RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the recent decision of the Finance Committee of the Board to retain all the University's present holdings of securities of the E. I. du Pont de Nemours Company be and it is hereby approved RESOLVED further that the foregoing resolution of approval of a specific action shall carry for future policy no implication of a special sentimental attachment for du Pont stocks, which now constitute 18 per cent of the total value of the University's common stocks, that, in the absence of special stipulations by a donor, all stocks shall be considered purely on the basis of their soundness and value to the University as investment property, with due regard for diversification in accordance with prudent investment policy. BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS COMMITTEE Mrs. Smith read to the Board the following report: The Buildings and Grounds committee met last night and herewith offer the following recommendations. 1. That the architectural plans designed by Frederick Nichols for six houses and the apartment house to be erected in the Piedmont area be approved. The plans have been carefully examined and are exhibited for your observation. 2. That in anticipation of the interior restoration of the Rotunda, a model be made according to the Jeffersonian design. Mr. Nichols stated that the complete set of plans for the Rotunda* * are preserved in the Alderman Library and that the Rotunda and the National Capitol are the only public buildings in this country having documentary plans. He further added that the restoration of the interior of the Rotunda would produce one of the handsomest buildings in America Committee - A. D. Barksdale Norborne Berkeley Henry E. McWane Emily P. Smith PIEDMONT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT Mrs. Smith laid before the Board for inspection and discussion Professor Nichols' plans referred to in the foregoing Report of her Committee. On Mrs. Smith's motion, duly seconded, the Board resolved that the plans as exhibited for six faculty houses and an apartment house at Piedmont be approved On motion of Colonel Hartfield, duly seconded, the Board resolved that the President be authorized to proceed with the Piedmont Housing Project as outlined and to expand it over the entire 14-acre tract on the basis of the plans exhibited, the financing to be arranged at the discretion of the President. ROTUNDA RESTORATION Mrs. Smith discussed the projected restoration of the Rotunda to its original Jeffersonian plan of three large oval rooms on the main floor with an upper dome room built to the scale of the interior of the Pantheon at Rome. Mrs. Smith spoke of the long hope of finding funds for the restoration, and reported a suggestion by President Darden that a model of the original interior be constructed to show the original proportions. The Board resolved that the President by authorized to have a model constructed showing the original arrangement of the Rotunda rooms TENNIS COURT CONSTRUCTION At the Rector's request Mr. Talbott, Chairman of the Athletic Committee, laid before the Board copies of a letter and enclosure of 3 October 1955 from Professor Mortimer M. Caplin, Chairman of the Athletic Council, to President Darden reporting certain inquiries regarding tennis court construction made by Mrs. Henry B. Mulholland and recommending the construction of six new tennis courts (at a roughly estimated cost of $24,000), the improvement and better maintenance of the present courts, and the designation of Mrs. Mulholland as a solicitor of funds for these purposes. After considerable discussion the matter was referred back to the Athletic Committee, on motion by Mr. Gravatt duly seconded, with the request that a formal motion be drafted for consideration by the full Board, this draft to be favorable to construction and improved maintenance of tennis courts, but to take cognizance of the following objections raised during the discussion. 1) The Board cannot commit itself to new construction expenditures for which funds are not available, 2) the University cannot be committed to special maintenance of tennis courts beyond the share available in the budget for all maintenance, 3) Solicitation of funds for this purpose must be under the President's direction so as to avoid conflict with the Alumni Fund and University solicitation for other urgent needs, 4) Private donations for this purpose will be welcomed, but neither Mrs. Mulholland nor any other private individual should be specifically designated by the Board of Visitors to raise funds for this project. FOOTBALL AND ATHLETIC CONTROL Mr. Talbott laid before the Board an original and copies of a Report dated 10 December 1955 on recent discussions with the faculty and on recent developments and attitudes regarding athletic policy and control. The Report was ordered to be filed. At the Rector's request President Darden discussed a proposed meeting of college and university presidents at Natural Bridge on December 19th in response to a suggestion by Senator Willis Robertson. Mr. Talbott suggested that the President could not do better at the meeting than to report just what our present policies actually are, and invite suggestions for improvement. MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE MATTERS BOARD TO MEET ON FEBRUARY 4th The Board resolved that its next meeting, which would normally fall on the second Saturday in February, be held on Saturday, February 4th at the President's Office INVITATION TO MR.

DEATH OF MORGAN LAFAYETTE COMBS President Darden announced to the Board the death on 25 October 1955 of Dr. Morgan Lafayette Combs, who was President of Mary Washington College from 1929 until April 1955, and has been since that date a staff member of the College on leave. There were expressions from the Board of regret for Dr. Combs' death and for the long illness that preceded it, of appreciation for Dr. Combs' devotion to the College and for his notable services in building up its strength during all the years of its attachment to the University prior to his own ill health. The Secretary was directed to record these expressions in the permanent minutes and to convey to Mrs. Combs the sympathy of the Visitors PAYMENTS TO MRS. COMBS President Darden spoke of the heavy expenses borne by Mrs. Combs during the many months of Dr. Combs' illness, and recommended approval of a request from her that the salary granted on 8 April 1955 to Dr. Combs from private funds of the University be paid to her The Board resolved that the unpaid balance of the year's salary of $9,400 appropriated for payment to Dr. Morgan L. Combs by the Board on 8 April 1955 from private funds of the University be paid to Mrs. Combs. ALUMNAE RESOLUTIONS The Rector laid before the Board a copy of resolutions in memory of Morgan L. Combs adopted by the Fredericksburg Chapter of the Alumnae Association. MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY FEES REDUCED President Darden presented a recommendation by the Dean of Medicine, concurred in by the Dean of Mary Washington College and approved by the Comptroller of the University, that the tuition fee for the course in Medical Technology be reduced from the present schedule of $210.00 to $100.00 Following a discussion of the matter the Board resolved accordingly that the tuition fee for Medical Technology be reduced to $100.00 for all students RELEASE OF RESTRICTIONS ON REICHEL PROPERTY President Darden again brought to the attention of the Board the matter of release by The Rector and Visitors of the residential restriction on property at the Southeast corner of William Street and College Avenue in Fredericksburg, Virginia. He reminded the Board that it had considered the matter at its meeting held on April 8, 1955. At that time the Board had before it a letter from Mr. Swart, Recorder of the Vestry of Trinity Church, Fredericksburg, dated March 31, 1955, requesting release from the residential restriction on said property which the Vestry desired to purchase as the site for the proposed new church, and letter from Mr. Edgar E. Woodward, Bursar of Mary Washington College, dated April 2, 1955, recommending the requested waiver. The Board adopted a resolution on April 8th, 1955, that the waiver be granted, subject to review by the University's Attorney, provided that the release of restrictions should apply "to church construction and to no other kind." It now transpires, the President stated, that the property in question is being purchased by The Trustees of the Diocesan Missionary Society of Virginia, a Virginia corporation, for the purpose of erecting a church, student center for young ladies of Mary Washington College, a parish house, and probably as the Diocesan Headquarters of the Episcopal Church. Under these circumstances, it was thought by Counsel for The Trustees of the Diocesan Missionary Society that the resolution of the Board adopted April 8, 1955, confining the release of restriction "to church construction and to no other kind" was not broad enough to authorize the erection of a student center, parish house and headquarters for the Diocesan Missionary Society. The President then presented to the Board a letter from William K. Goolrick to Mr. C. Venable Minor, Special Counsel for the University, dated October 29, 1955, requesting that the release of restrictions should apply to "Church, Religious or Educational purposes and to no other kind." Mr. Darden also presented to the Board a copy of the proposed deed from The Rector and Visitors to the Trustees of the Diocesan Missionary Society of Virginia releasing the property in question from the residential restrictions thereon insofar as it affects the use of said tract or parcel of land for Church, Religious or Educational purposes and to no other kind After discussion and careful consideration, upon motion duly seconded, it was, RESOLVED that The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, as owner of certain property in the City of Fredericksburg, Virginia, acquired from Frank H. Reichel and wife, by deed dated August 30, 1946, of record in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of the City of Fredericksburg in D.B. 82 p. 340, release from the residential restrictions applicable thereto, certain property at the southeast corner of William Street and College Avenue in Fredericksburg, Virginia, sold by The Fredericksburg Aquaduct Company, Incorporated to The Trustees of the Diocesan Missionary Society of Virginia, insofar as it affects the use of the above described tract or parcel of land for Church, Religious or Educational purposes and to no other kind, RESOLVED FURTHER, that, Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President, be and he is hereby authorized and empowered to execute such release in the form as presented to this meeting, in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and that Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., Secretary, be and he is hereby authorized and empowered to affix the seal of the corporation to said release and to attest the same CHANGE OF TITLE OF ADMINISTRATOR Mr. Coxe, Chairman of the special Committee on Change of Title of the Administrator of Mary Washington College, read to the Board the following proposed addition to the resolution adopted at the meeting of 10 June 1955 relative to the change of title of the chief administrative officer of the College resident in Fredericksburg BE IT RESOLVED FURTHER, That Section 23-76 of the Code of Virginia be amended and re-enacted to read as follows (the changed wording being underlined): "The board shall be charged with the care and preservation of all property belonging to the University. They shall appoint a president, with such duties as may be prescribed by the board, and who shall have supreme administrative direction under the authority of the board over all the schools, colleges and branches of the University wherever located, and they shall appoint as many professors as they deem proper, and, with the assent of two-thirds of the whole number of visitors, may remove such president or any professor. They may prescribe the duties of each professor, and the course and mode of instruction. They may appoint a bursar and proctor, and employ any other agents or servants, regulate the government and discipline of the students, and the renting of the rooms and dormitories, and, generally, in respect to the government and management of the University, make such regulations as they may deem expedient, not being contrary to law. To enable the proctor and visitors of the University to procure a supply of water, and to construct and maintain a system of water-works, drainage, and sewerage for the University they shall have power and authority to acquire such springs, lands and rights of way as may be necessary, according to the provisions of Title 25." On motion of Mr. Coxe, duly seconded, the Board resolved that the foregoing addition to the resolution of 10 June 1955 be approved -â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â- On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
