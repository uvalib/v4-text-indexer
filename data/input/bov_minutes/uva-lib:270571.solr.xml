On motion the Board adjourned to meet tomorrow morning at 9 Oclock. Jas. D. Jones Secretary p.t. B. Johnson Barbour Rector of U. of Virginia June 29th 1871 The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday and was called to order by the Rector. Present the same members as on yesterday Resolved That the appropriations recommended by the Report of the Faculty for the several Schools and for repairs and play grounds for the Students are hereby allowed as specified, and that the appropriation for Books for the Law department is allowed to the extent of two hundred dollars. The following Report of the Committee on Finance for 1871 was received, adopted and ordered to be recorded. Your Committee on Finance respectfully report as follows. The debt of the University which existed at the time of the appointment of the present Board of Visitors was $38,600 made up as follows- To the Va. Military Institute $20,000 To the Estate of P. St. G. Cocke 5,000 To the Estate of G. W. Spooner 2,600 To the Estate of L. M. Coleman 2,500 On bonds issued to Martha Randolph 8,500 $38,600 On the advice of the Faculty and to prevent the occupation of the grounds by objectionable tenants, the present Board in the year     , directed the purchase of the property adjacent to the University, known as Carr's Hill. Since then other debts, looking to the advancement of the University, have been created. The following are purposes for which these debts have been created. For Carr's Hill $10,000 For the water works (about) 5,500 For the new Laboratory &amp;c 23,500 For a new dining Hall 4,000 For improvements to Professor Venable's Pavilion 2,500 For improvements on Carr's Hill 1,500 Towards enlargement of the Washington Hall 500 For Professor Mallet's Pavilion 9,250 For Tile Machine 850 For Books, aparatus, &amp;c connected with Schools of Technology &amp; Appl'd Mathematics. (about) 2,000 $59,600 The aggregate of previously existing debt and of expenditures on permanent objects for the advancement of the University, amounts, therefore, to the sum of $98,200. Partly from the proceeds of the Miller fund, and partly from current receipts, a portion of this expenditure has been paid off; leaving the present indebtedness of the University as of the 1st June 1871, according to the Report of the Proctor &amp; Superintendent, at $82,913, as follows UNMATURED DEBT To Va. Military Institute $20,000 Estate of P. St. G. Cocke 5,000 C. W. Gill- Carr's Hill 2,000 Agricultural Loan 25,000 $52,000 MATURED DEBT To Martha Randolph $8,000 To Est. of L. M. Coleman 1,500 To C. S. Venable 1,250 To C. W. Gill- Carr's Hill 2,000 12,750 Floating Debt 18,163 Total existing debt $82,913 Eight per cent bonds, to the amount of $30,000, as the Board is aware, have been placed on the market, and it is expected that they will produce a fund adequate to pay off the matured debt of the University, and to extinguish the floating debt; thus placing the entire debt of the institution on a stable footing. The financial policy of the Board should, of course, be, to provide for the gradual liquidation of this debt. The practice of a rigid economy by the Board of Visitors and the limitations of the salaries of the Professors, to a maximum of $3000 have placed the finances of the University on such a footing as to encourage the Proctor &amp; Superintendent to believe that, by the year 1880, with the practice of an enlightened economy, he may be able to pay off the new issue of 8 per cent bonds for $30,000. This seems to us quite practicable. The receipts of the University for the year ending June 1st 1871, from ordinary sources, including $8,800 from the Miller Fund, were $48,427.33, and we see no reason to apprehend any other falling off in these receipts, than a reduction of the income from the Miller Fund to about $6,500 The ordinary expenditures of the institution may be reduced within $38,000 as is proved by the fact, that those for the year ending with the beginning of the present month, including interest paid, were $38,184. The Excess of ordinary receipts over ordinary expenditures during the year just ended were nearly five thousand dollars. Your Committee believe that this excess, during the year now commenced, can be brought up to seven or eight thousand dollars; the amount depending of course very much upon the policy of the Board in authorizing extraordinary outlays of money. You Committee recommend a rigid policy in this regard; by adopting and pursuing which, a surplus of five thousand dollars or more may be carried each year to the credit of the debt All of which is respectfully submitted. (Signed) R. W. Hughes Saml Watts The Committee on "Grounds &amp; Buildings" submitted the following report. We, the undersigned, a Committee appointed to examine the condition of the "Buildings and Grounds" of the University, respectfully report, that they have performed that duty, and are gratified to find that they are in good condition. But we would recommend that the Proctor be requested to have the roof on the Southern part of Dr. Harrison's House examined, and endeavour to prevent the same from leakage, if the same can be done without too large an expenditure of money. We, also, recommend the necessary repairs to the "Instrument room" of Professor Smith, and the erection of the Partition in the passage adjoining the same by the University employees, as the said Smith may direct. John R. Woods Committee W. E. M. Word Committee The above report was received and the following resolution adopted; That the Proctor be authorized to make the repairs suggested on Dr. Harrison's Pavilion at a cost not exceeding two hundred &amp; fifty dollars. Resolved, that the Health Officers be requested to furnish the Board at each annual meeting with a report of the number of students who shall have received medical attendance from them during the year, specifying those attended to at the Infirmary and those receiving medical attendance without. Resolved, that the Chairman of the Faculty be respectfully requested to enquire into the present ownership of the building on the University grounds, known as the "Temperance Hall", and now occupied as a Post-Office, Book Store &amp;c- leaving it discretionary with him after such investigation whether he will take further action- and if necessary to employ Counsel at a stipulated fee. Resolved that the Executive Committee be instructed to enquire into the propriety of reducing the salary of the Janitor to$300 in view of the diminution of his duties—and to take final action in the case. In view of the recommendation of the Faculty and seeking as far as practicable to equalize the compensation of Professors. It is ordered that whenever hereafter any Professor whose income falls below the Maximum (after counting Fees, Salary, pay for services at Infirmary or from any other ligitimate source) shall have fifteen but less that twenty non-paying students in his class he shall receive one hundred dollars-and when the number reaches twenty or more he shall receive one hundred and fifty dollars- Provided as intimated above that the maximum of Income shall in no case be exceeded, and further that it is not intended to interfere with the aggregate number of non-paying students now allowed in the University. Resolved, That James D. Jones is hereby elected as Secretary of the Board of Visitors, his duties to commence as of the 1st of July- his compensation to be $100 per year, said sum to be deducted from the sum of $800 now paid to Wm. Wertenbaker leaving his compensation at $700 per annum as from the 1st day of July 1871. Resolved, that the sum of $325 is hereby appropriated (out of the Infirmary Fund) for Repairs and Equipment of said Infirmary. Professor Charles S. Venable was re-elected Chairman of the Faculty. Resolved that the Board declines to charge the repairs of the Parsonage upon the Treasury of the University. Resolved, That the Proctor be enjoined to employ the most rigorous and efficient means to prevent such trespasses as have heretofore been made on the property of the University- and to that end that he shall be especially vigilant in warning all parties concerned, that no lands or tenements belonging to the University shall be rented to, or occupied by any person not in the regular employment of a Resident. The following proceedings of the Trustees of the "Miller Fund" were communicated to the Board and ordered to be spread upon the minutes. At a meeting of the Trustees of the Miller Fund held for the benefit of the University of Virginia the following proceedings were had. Resolved, That the following appropriations be made for the fiscal year commencing on the 1st day of October 1871. For the two Miller Scholarships $1000 For the employment of a Superintendent and hands for the Experimental Farm 1000 For the rent of Dr. Boeck's House 300 For Salary of Dr. Boeck 200 For rent of Laboratory 500 For Salary of Dr. Mallet 500 Provided, however, that should the State of Virginia pay the January interest upon the state stock held by the Trustees, the salary of Prof. Mallet shall be increased to $1000. Resolved as the sense of this Board that the unexpended balance of the appropriation made last year, for the employment of a superintendent and hands for, and the conduct of, the Experimental Farm, should be applied exclusively to those purposes. A copy from the minutes R. T. W. Duke, Secretary The Board then adjourned sine die. Wm. Wertenbaker Secretary B. Johnson Barbour Rector of U. of Virginia At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors, held May 23rd 1872. Present B. Johnson Barbour, R. G. H Kean, E. B. Montague, Micajah Woods, and Thomas Smith. B. Johnson Barbour late Rector called the Board to order, and on motion, it was resolved that he be requested to act as Rector pro tempore. The Rector PT laid before the Board a report which had been unanimously adopted by the Faculty at a meeting held on the 22nd instant, requesting that some definite arrangement be made before the close of the session for filling the vacant Chair of Chemistry and Pharmacy- and also a report from the Proctor exhibiting the condition of the finances of the University- Whereupon Resolved, that a committee of three (of which the Rector pro tem shall be one) is appointed to confer with the Faculty in reference to the Chair of Chemistry and Pharmacy- and to counsel with the Trustees of the "Miller Fund" on all points in which said Chair pertains to the Department of Agriculture-and the said Committee is further instructed (as far as is compatible with the discharge of the duties above imposed) to consider the financial condition of the University,- and to report the result of their investigations to the next meeting of this Board. The Committee under the foregoing resolution consists of Messrs. Barbour, Kean and Woods. Resolved, that Mason Gordon Esq. be appointed Commissioner of Accounts for the University of Virginia- before whom the Proctor shall make his monthly settlements- provided that the fee for each settlement shall not exceed the compensation now allowed by law to Commissioners in Chancery for similar work under orders of the Court and provided further that the fee for each settlement shall not exceed ten dollars. Resolved, that the Proctor submit to the Board of Visitors through the Chairman of the Faculty, at the regular meeting in June next, a detailed estimate of the expenditures for the ensuing fiscal year, showing under appropriate heads, the various items of necessary expenditure, basing such estimates upon the average expenditures of past years, as far as applicable and having regard to a rigorous economy. That the Proctor in like manner, report to the next meeting of this Board a more detailed statement than the one submitted at the present meeting of this Board of the funded and floating debt of the University, showing the actual debt due; the date and amount of each issue of Bonds outstanding; the rate of interest payable on each class; the time when each did or will mature and the terms on which loans have been effected during the current fiscal year. Resolved, that in view of the financial condition of the University developed by the report of the Proctor transmitted to this Board at the present meeting by the Chairman of the Faculty, and of the suggestion contained in his letter, the Chairman and Faculty are requested to give special consideration to the subject of Scholarships as a means of financial relief, in the Report to the next regular meeting of this Board to be made under the first Resolution adopted by the Board of Visitors on the 2nd August 1864- and to make such other suggestions looking to the improvement of the finances of the University as they may deem expedient. Resolved that the applications of Professors Davis, Venable, Boeck and Southall in reference to change of residence and occupancy of the vacant Pavilion be laid on the table for consideration at the next meeting of the Board. The Board adjourned to meet again on Saturday the 22nd day of June at 3 Oclock P.M. and the Secretary was instructed to give notice of the meeting to the absent members of the Board. Jas. D.

      <field name="fulltext">June 29th 1871 The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday and was called to order by the Rector. Present the same members as on yesterday Resolved That the appropriations recommended by the Report of the Faculty for the several Schools and for repairs and play grounds for the Students are hereby allowed as specified, and that the appropriation for Books for the Law department is allowed to the extent of two hundred dollars. The following Report of the Committee on Finance for 1871 was received, adopted and ordered to be recorded. Your Committee on Finance respectfully report as follows. The debt of the University which existed at the time of the appointment of the present Board of Visitors was $38,600 made up as follows- To the Va. Military Institute $20,000 To the Estate of P. St. G. Cocke 5,000 To the Estate of G. W. Spooner 2,600 To the Estate of L. M. Coleman 2,500 On bonds issued to Martha Randolph 8,500 $38,600 On the advice of the Faculty and to prevent the occupation of the grounds by objectionable tenants, the present Board in the year     , directed the purchase of the property adjacent to the University, known as Carr's Hill. Since then other debts, looking to the advancement of the University, have been created. The following are purposes for which these debts have been created. For Carr's Hill $10,000 For the water works (about) 5,500 For the new Laboratory &amp;c 23,500 For a new dining Hall 4,000 For improvements to Professor Venable's Pavilion 2,500 For improvements on Carr's Hill 1,500 Towards enlargement of the Washington Hall 500 For Professor Mallet's Pavilion 9,250 For Tile Machine 850 For Books, aparatus, &amp;c connected with Schools of Technology &amp; Appl'd Mathematics. (about) 2,000 $59,600 The aggregate of previously existing debt and of expenditures on permanent objects for the advancement of the University, amounts, therefore, to the sum of $98,200. Partly from the proceeds of the Miller fund, and partly from current receipts, a portion of this expenditure has been paid off; leaving the present indebtedness of the University as of the 1st June 1871, according to the Report of the Proctor &amp; Superintendent, at $82,913, as follows UNMATURED DEBT To Va. Military Institute $20,000 Estate of P. St. G. Cocke 5,000 C. W. Gill- Carr's Hill 2,000 Agricultural Loan 25,000 $52,000 MATURED DEBT To Martha Randolph $8,000 To Est. of L. M. Coleman 1,500 To C. S. Venable 1,250 To C. W. Gill- Carr's Hill 2,000 12,750 Floating Debt 18,163 Total existing debt $82,913 Eight per cent bonds, to the amount of $30,000, as the Board is aware, have been placed on the market, and it is expected that they will produce a fund adequate to pay off the matured debt of the University, and to extinguish the floating debt; thus placing the entire debt of the institution on a stable footing. The financial policy of the Board should, of course, be, to provide for the gradual liquidation of this debt. The practice of a rigid economy by the Board of Visitors and the limitations of the salaries of the Professors, to a maximum of $3000 have placed the finances of the University on such a footing as to encourage the Proctor &amp; Superintendent to believe that, by the year 1880, with the practice of an enlightened economy, he may be able to pay off the new issue of 8 per cent bonds for $30,000. This seems to us quite practicable. The receipts of the University for the year ending June 1st 1871, from ordinary sources, including $8,800 from the Miller Fund, were $48,427.33, and we see no reason to apprehend any other falling off in these receipts, than a reduction of the income from the Miller Fund to about $6,500 The ordinary expenditures of the institution may be reduced within $38,000 as is proved by the fact, that those for the year ending with the beginning of the present month, including interest paid, were $38,184. The Excess of ordinary receipts over ordinary expenditures during the year just ended were nearly five thousand dollars. Your Committee believe that this excess, during the year now commenced, can be brought up to seven or eight thousand dollars; the amount depending of course very much upon the policy of the Board in authorizing extraordinary outlays of money. You Committee recommend a rigid policy in this regard; by adopting and pursuing which, a surplus of five thousand dollars or more may be carried each year to the credit of the debt All of which is respectfully submitted.
