If there should be no applicant for such a scholarship whose home is in Missouri, or if the University shall not award such scholarship aid in any year for any other reason, the income from the scholarship fund derived during such year shall be added to the principal thereof. In awarding the financial aid thus provided, preference shall be given to applicants who reside in St. Louis and St. Louis County, Missouri, with first preference to those residing in St. Louis County. Whenever feasible, preference shall also be given to those graduate or undergraduate students, fulfilling the previous conditions, who intend to enroll or who are enrolled in courses at the Woodrow Wilson School of Foreign Affairs of the University. A draft of the proposed trust agreement between Mr. Love and The Rector and Visitors, prepared by the University's Special Counsel, Mr. Minor, was being submitted to Mr. Love for approval. The President explained that the funds donated by Mr. Love were being deposited by Mr. Love in the Prudential Savings &amp; Loan Association, of Clayton, Missouri, of which Mr. Love is President and that the Savings Association desired a resolution of this Board authorizing the proper officers of the University to open an account, to make withdrawals therefrom, and to execute a proxy to be voted at all annual and special meetings of the Association held when the University is not specially represented. He then submitted for consideration a resolution and proxy in the forms desired by the Savings Association. After careful consideration and full discussion, upon motion, duly seconded, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted by the Board RESOLVED, that the proper officers of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia are hereby authorized to open either a passbook or a certificate share account, as to them seems preferable, and to execute for and on its behalf, the proxy in the form submitted to this Board, and to invest its funds from time to time with Prudential Savings &amp; Loan Association, Clayton, Missouri, and that said Association is hereby authorized to act without further inquiry in accordance with writings bearing the signatures of either of such officers, unless and until it has been notified of any change of officers and of further authorization for other individuals to so sign, together with a specimen of the signature of each such individual. The officers so authorized are Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., President, and Vincent Shea, Comptroller. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia hereby desires to place on record its grateful appreciation and thanks to John Allan Love, of Clayton, Missour, an alumnus of the Class of 1907, for his generous gifts to the University of Virginia for the purpose of establishing a scholarship. THE GEORGE BASKERVILLE ZEHMER ROOM IN MADISON HALL The President stated that he had received a letter from the Dean of the Division of Extension and General Studies, Mr. James W. Cole, Jr., proposing on behalf of the staff of the Division that the West Room in the new quarters of the Division at Madison Hall be named in honor of the late George Baskerville Zehmer, for many years Dean of the Division of Extension and General Studies. The President noted that Mr. Zehmer was the first Director (the title was later changed to Dean) and had served in that position for 38 years. The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the West Room of Madison Hall be named "The George Baskerville Zehmer Room" to honor and to reflect the contributions of the late Dean George Baskerville Zehmer to the Division of Extension and General Studies, to the University of Virginia, to the Commonwealth of Virginia, and to the Nation. SCHOOL OF GENERAL STUDIES The President reported that he and the Dean of the Division of Extension and General Studies, Mr. James W. Cole, Jr., had been considering a change in the name of the Division. A change was needed, the President stated, to recognize more fully the role of the Division in the general educational program of the University through the offering of work for college credit at the several Extension Centers. The President reminded the Board of his statement at the meeting of the Board on 14 October 1961 concerning the use of off-campus branches in the Extension Centers of the University to determine whether a community college was needed. He and the Dean had decided that the most appropriate name was that of "School of General Studies" which, he noted, was one in general use in other universities in the country. The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, effective 1 July 1962, the name of the Division of Extension and General Studies shall be changed to School of General Studies. REPORT ON STUDENT DISCIPLINE The President reported in detail on the recent disturbances resulting from the actions of some students on two occasions and on the conduct of several fraternities on Bid Sunday. He stated that, as a result of these disturbances, certain actions had been taken to prevent future disturbances of a mass nature. The two specific actions were (1) a ban on open parties at fraternities in the future, and (2) the imposition of the penalty of suspension for any student found guilty of participation in a riot or unlawful assembly. The President noted, however, that the student leaders had shown great maturity and were unanimously behind the move to ban disturbances of this kind and deserved high praise for their conduct. Moreover, he stated that the Dean of the University, Mr. B. F. D. Runk, had imposed the penalty of social probation on several fraternities for their disgraceful conduct on Bid Sunday. He noted that Dean Runk throughout the whole period had performed in a manner far above and beyond the call of duty. On the whole, he believed that the disturbances, while very regrettable, did permit action to be taken which would be very helpful in the future. UNCOLLECTIBLE HOSPITAL ACCOUNTS The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 1031, 1032, 1035, and 1036, aggregating $36,993.09 as recommended by it, consisting of the following Bad debts, etc. $14,428.55 Free service to Counties and Cities 22,564.54 TOTAL $36,993.09 FINANCIAL REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF ATHLETICS The President laid before the Board a copy of the annual financial report of the Department of Athletics for the fiscal year ending on 30 June 1961. He reminded the Board that a copy of this report was required by law to be deposited with the State Director of the Budget prior to 31 December of each year. PROPERTY EASEMENTS ON EMMET STREET The President stated that he had received a request from the City Manager of the City of Charlottesville for some easements on certain University property for use in expanding the present two-lane street from the C &amp; O underpass north to a four-lane divided street. He informed the Board that certain problems relating to the traffic flow into this street from University Gardens had not yet been worked out in detail and stated that the matter could not wait for action by the full Board at its meeting in February and hence his recommendation on the matter would have to be submitted to the Executive Committee.
