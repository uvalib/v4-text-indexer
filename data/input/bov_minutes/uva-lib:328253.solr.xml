      <field name="fulltext">University, Va. November 26, 1918. A call meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at 8 o'clock in the evening with the following members present: The Rector, R. T. Irvine, and Visitors Goodrich Hatton, Judge J. K. M. Norton, C. Harding Walker, G. R. B. Michie, and John Stewart Bryan, and President Alderman. The minutes of the meeting of June 10th, 1918, which had been copied and sent to the members of the Board, were approved. The President presented the enrollments in the several schools for the session and went over the military situation at some length. He also stated that it had been his intention to prepare and present to this meeting a new budget for the fiscal year to take care of conditions growing out of the change incident to the establishment of the S. A. T. C. But in view of the fact that demobilization was about to take place he had found it impossible to make up said budget with any degree of accuracy and would, therefore, have to defer its present ation until a later meeting. The President announced the following gifts and settlements of bequests which he had duly acknowledged on the part of the Board: An oil portrait of Hon. A. C. Gordon from the Beverley Club of Staunton, Virginia. The following letter concerning the portrait was received from the Beverley Club. The Beverley Club, Staunton, Va., Sept. 19, 1918. President E.

REPORT OF W. ALLAN PERKINS, ATTORNEY FOR THE UNIVERSITY, OF THE SETTLEMENT OF THE ESTATE OF MISS MARY AMELIA SMITH. To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia: Gentlemen:- Miss Mary Amelia Smith of Warrenton, Va., departed this life some time during September 1911, leaving a will in which the following provisions appear: "I hereby place my estate in the hands of the Fidelity and Trust Company of Baltimore, which with concurrance of my hereby appointed Executor, Hon. Eppa Hunton, will proceed at once to make the most profitable investment of such trust, paying to my brothers, Thomas Smith and Frederick Waugh Smith, equal shares of the interest of such trust. "At the close of the life of either or both of these legatees, each share becomes the absolute property of the University of Virginia under the supervision of the President of the University, to be expended in a permanent tribute to my father, Major-General and Ex-Governor William Smith — easily recognized, not obscured by a multiplicity of others." Major Frederick Waugh Smith notified his brother, Col. Thomas Smith, and the University of Virginia that he intended to contest the will on the grounds of the uncertainty of its provisions, but at the same time he made a proposition of compromise. At a meeting of the Board of Visitors held on the 12th of November 1912, the following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED: THAT the Board accept the proposition made by Mr. Frederick Waugh Smith, one of the devisees and legatees under the will of Miss Mary Amelia Smith, viz., that he will refrain from his proposed proposed attack upon said will upon condition that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia surrender in absolute right the one-half of the estate passing under said will to said Frederick W. Smith, and that John B. Moon, the attorney for the University, be authorized to carry this agreement into effect. By agreement of the parties interested, however, the provisions of said will may be modified or set aside in whole or in part with a view to carrying out the proposed settlement. RESOLVED: That this action of the Board is taken through their respect and esteem for Col. Thomas Smith, another legatee and devisee under said will, and their regard for his wishes in the premises. Pursuant to the terms of this resolution, a contract was entered into on the 20th of November 1912, between the Rector and Visitors, Col. Thomas Smith and Major Frederick Smith, by which all parties renounced the provisions of the will and agreed, first, that said will should be admitted to probate, and that Col. Thomas Smith should qualify as Administrator with the will annexed, Mr. Eppa Hunton having declined to act; and, second, that the entire estate of Miss Smith should be divided into two parts; third, that one of these parts should be turned over to Major Frederick Waugh Smith in fee simple; fourth, that the other half should be held by Col. Thomas Smith in trust, the income thereof to be used by him during his life, and at his death the principal thereof to become the absolute property of the University of Virginia. In May 1916 I was advised by Mr. J. Donald Richards, of Warrenton, Va., that Col. Smith had never settled his accounts as Administrator or as Trustee, and that as attorney for the bonding company which had become surety upon Col. Smith's bond he was about to institute proceedings against Col. Smith for an account. Upon investigation it was found that owing to his advanced years Col. Smith had not given any attention to the management of this fund, and it soon became apparent that if anything was to be saved for the University it would be necessary for Col. Smith to be removed and a new Administrator and Trustee appointed in his place. At a meeting of the Board of Visitors held on the 12th of June 1916, full authority was given me to take such action in the matter as in my opinion might be necessary. Thereupon, on motion of the surety company, acting with our consent and approval, Col. Smith was removed, and Mr. Walter H. Robertson of Warrenton appointed in his place and stead. The situation was a delicate one in many respects, and required very careful handling. I found it necessary to associate Mr. George Latham Fletcher, of Warrenton, with me, so that the University might have a representative in Warrenton. It was impossible to get any statement from Col. Smith and it was necessary to file a bill in Fauquier Circuit Court for the purpose of discovering what the assets of the estate consisted of. Among other assets we found $7500.00 worth of bonds which were secured by deed of trust upon real estate in the city of Washington. Col. Smith had allowed the interest to accumulate on these bonds, and when we sold the property under the deed of trust there was a loss amounting to $3054.04. Mr. Robertson, as Administrator, has instituted suit against the maker of these bonds for the recovery of this deficiency. Conditions are such that we have little hope of recovery. Major Frederick Waugh Smith came in and made additional claims against the estate, all of which I am now advised have been satisfactorily disposed of. The total amount of the estate which will be turned over to the University by Mr. Robertson as Administrator is between $8500.00 and $9000.00. Of this amount some $1500.00 in cash was delivered to E. I. Carruthers, Bursar, on the 25th inst., together with bonds aggregating $4200.00. The remaining securities will be delivered by Mr. Robertson within a few days. As shown by Mr. Robertson's statement filed with Mr. Carruthers, the whole estate consists of money and securities which can be readily turned into cash, with the exception of a piece of real estate in Anniston, Alabama. We are advised that this lot is worth at least $500.00. Mr. Robertson tells me, however, that he is reliably informed that if this lot is properly handled, more than $500.00 may be realized from it. I will recommend that a resolution be adopted at this meeting constituting the Rector and the Chairman of the Executive Committee a special Committee of two, with full power to sell this property, cae being taken to phrase the resolution so that authority will also be given the Rector to convey in case of a sale. In conclusion I will add that much credit is due both to Mr. Robertson and to Judge Fletcher in saving for the University such of this estate as now remains, for I am confident that had it not been for their efforts practically the whole fund would have been lost. Respectfully submitted, W. Allan Perkins. Nove. 26th, 1918. In connection with the foregoing report the following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED: That the report of W. Allan Perkins, Attorney, dealing with the settlement of the estate of Miss Mary Amelia Smith, deceased, presented by him at this meeting, is hereby approved, ratified and confirmed in all respects, and in accordance with the suggestion contained therein the question of the sale of the lot in Anniston, Alabama, is hereby referred to the Rector and the Chairman of the Executive Committee, to whom full authority is hereby given to deal with said lot as to them may seem best - either holding the same or making sale thereof at such price and at such time as they may think desirable; and if sale there of shall be made the Rector is hereby given full authority to execute and deliver a deed conveying said lot.

The President presented the temporary contract entered into between the University of Virginia and the War Department Committee on Education and Special Training for the establishment at the University of a Students' Army Training Corps on the 16th of September which had been signed by the Rector on behalf of the Board of Visitors. The contract was read and the action of the Rector in signing same was approved and the contract ratified.

Witness: Secretary of War Department Committee on Education and Special Training. NOTE: Insert at this point a number of cents equal to the yearly tuition fee of the institution (or department thereof) in the college year of 1917-1918 divided by 270; e.g. on an average yearly tuition fee of $100.00 the amount is 100 ÷ 270 = .3703 cents. In connection with the payment to holders of the Ryan and other scholarships of the emoluments as fixed in each case, the President stated that upon the establishment of the S. A. T. C. Unit he instructed the Bursar to withhold the payment to such men as were accepted in said unit, but now that demobilization will soon take place asked for an option as to whether or not the holders should be paid emoluments for the full session, and it was the concensus of opinion that the Bursar should be instructed to pay the full emolument. The following communication was received from the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway Company asking for permission to construct a loop in its track on the grounds of the University near the C. &amp; O. Bridge on Rugby Road: Charlottesville, Va. October 15th, 1918. To the Honorable Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. Gentlemen: On November 18th, 1910 you kindly granted permission to the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway Company, of Charlottesville, Virginia, a corporation duly chartered under the laws of the State of Virginia, to lay its track along the terrace west of what is known as Rugby Road, from the Ivy Road on the South to the C. &amp; O. overhead bridge on the North, distance of 1050 feet: to be laid under the general supervision and direction of the President and Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings of the University of Virginia, and the Chairman of the Executive Committee of our Board, with the condition that the track and works of the company be removed at their own expense on 60 days notice from the Board, at the pleasure of the Board. On account of the use of the Modern Single End One Man cars it became necessary to operate a turntable at the C. &amp; O. bridge on Rugby Road in order to turn car for return trip, this requires the services of two men and is very troublesome and expensive, especially in Winter when it freezes, interfering with the service. We will greatly appreciate it if your Board will grant us permission to remove the turntable and replace with a loop at end of line, under the same conditions hereinbefore mentioned. Thanking you in advance for the above, Very truly yours, John L. Livers, Vice Pres., Charlottesville &amp; Albemarle Railway A committee consisting of the Hon. E. G. Haden, Mayor of Charlottesville, Mr. John L. Livers, Vice-President of the C. &amp; A. Railway Company, and Dr. W. M. Forrest, a resident of the section affected by the operation of the railway line at this point, was heard asking that said privilege be granted. The Mayor presented a copy of resolution adopted by the Council of the City of Charlottesville requesting the Rector and Visitors to allow the C. &amp; A. Ry. Company to lay said loop. The matter was disposed of with the following resolution being unanimously adopted: RESOLVED: That the Rector be authorized to enter into a contract with the C. &amp; A. Ry. Co. for construction of a loop in its railway track on the grounds of the University, to be located near the bridge on Pugby Road, on such terms and conditions as may seem proper. The President brought to the Board's attention the matter of furniture rented for the University dormitories while used as barracks and also the method to be adopted in furnishing them for the remainder of the session. The matter was referred to the following committee with power to act: the President, Mr. Michie, Prof. Newcomb, Dr. Lambeth, and the Bursar. Upon request of the President an appropriation of $120.95 was made to cover renewal of the cooking range and certain plumbing repairs at the President's residence. Prof. J. L. Newcomb, supervisor of Section B, S. A. T. C., presented in person the financial and statistical reports of said section and asked for instructions as to filing the usual monthly voucher for November, whereupon the following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED, That the usual monthly voucher covering housing, subsistence, and education for Section B, S.A.T.C. of the University of Virginia be submitted to the committee on Education and Special Training for the month of November, 1918., and with it a statement be submitted by Professor J. L. Newcomb, Director of said Unit, that he is ready for an accounting for Section B, with the further statement that the Board of Visitors regard Section A and B as integral parts of one general transaction. The Bursar submitted a number of financial reports from his office, which were read and considered, among which was one showing excesses and deficiencies in the appropriation budget for 1917-18, as spread below, and requested that appropriations be made from the unexpended balances to cover the deficiencies in order that his accounts be properly cleared for the year, which was adopted.

      <field name="fulltext">To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia: Gentlemen:- Miss Mary Amelia Smith of Warrenton, Va., departed this life some time during September 1911, leaving a will in which the following provisions appear: "I hereby place my estate in the hands of the Fidelity and Trust Company of Baltimore, which with concurrance of my hereby appointed Executor, Hon. Eppa Hunton, will proceed at once to make the most profitable investment of such trust, paying to my brothers, Thomas Smith and Frederick Waugh Smith, equal shares of the interest of such trust. "At the close of the life of either or both of these legatees, each share becomes the absolute property of the University of Virginia under the supervision of the President of the University, to be expended in a permanent tribute to my father, Major-General and Ex-Governor William Smith — easily recognized, not obscured by a multiplicity of others." Major Frederick Waugh Smith notified his brother, Col. Thomas Smith, and the University of Virginia that he intended to contest the will on the grounds of the uncertainty of its provisions, but at the same time he made a proposition of compromise. At a meeting of the Board of Visitors held on the 12th of November 1912, the following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED: THAT the Board accept the proposition made by Mr. Frederick Waugh Smith, one of the devisees and legatees under the will of Miss Mary Amelia Smith, viz., that he will refrain from his proposed proposed attack upon said will upon condition that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia surrender in absolute right the one-half of the estate passing under said will to said Frederick W. Smith, and that John B. Moon, the attorney for the University, be authorized to carry this agreement into effect. By agreement of the parties interested, however, the provisions of said will may be modified or set aside in whole or in part with a view to carrying out the proposed settlement. RESOLVED: That this action of the Board is taken through their respect and esteem for Col. Thomas Smith, another legatee and devisee under said will, and their regard for his wishes in the premises. Pursuant to the terms of this resolution, a contract was entered into on the 20th of November 1912, between the Rector and Visitors, Col. Thomas Smith and Major Frederick Smith, by which all parties renounced the provisions of the will and agreed, first, that said will should be admitted to probate, and that Col. Thomas Smith should qualify as Administrator with the will annexed, Mr. Eppa Hunton having declined to act; and, second, that the entire estate of Miss Smith should be divided into two parts; third, that one of these parts should be turned over to Major Frederick Waugh Smith in fee simple; fourth, that the other half should be held by Col. Thomas Smith in trust, the income thereof to be used by him during his life, and at his death the principal thereof to become the absolute property of the University of Virginia. In May 1916 I was advised by Mr. J. Donald Richards, of Warrenton, Va., that Col. Smith had never settled his accounts as Administrator or as Trustee, and that as attorney for the bonding company which had become surety upon Col. Smith's bond he was about to institute proceedings against Col. Smith for an account. Upon investigation it was found that owing to his advanced years Col. Smith had not given any attention to the management of this fund, and it soon became apparent that if anything was to be saved for the University it would be necessary for Col. Smith to be removed and a new Administrator and Trustee appointed in his place. At a meeting of the Board of Visitors held on the 12th of June 1916, full authority was given me to take such action in the matter as in my opinion might be necessary. Thereupon, on motion of the surety company, acting with our consent and approval, Col. Smith was removed, and Mr. Walter H. Robertson of Warrenton appointed in his place and stead. The situation was a delicate one in many respects, and required very careful handling. I found it necessary to associate Mr. George Latham Fletcher, of Warrenton, with me, so that the University might have a representative in Warrenton. It was impossible to get any statement from Col. Smith and it was necessary to file a bill in Fauquier Circuit Court for the purpose of discovering what the assets of the estate consisted of. Among other assets we found $7500.00 worth of bonds which were secured by deed of trust upon real estate in the city of Washington. Col. Smith had allowed the interest to accumulate on these bonds, and when we sold the property under the deed of trust there was a loss amounting to $3054.04. Mr. Robertson, as Administrator, has instituted suit against the maker of these bonds for the recovery of this deficiency. Conditions are such that we have little hope of recovery. Major Frederick Waugh Smith came in and made additional claims against the estate, all of which I am now advised have been satisfactorily disposed of. The total amount of the estate which will be turned over to the University by Mr. Robertson as Administrator is between $8500.00 and $9000.00. Of this amount some $1500.00 in cash was delivered to E. I. Carruthers, Bursar, on the 25th inst., together with bonds aggregating $4200.00. The remaining securities will be delivered by Mr. Robertson within a few days. As shown by Mr. Robertson's statement filed with Mr. Carruthers, the whole estate consists of money and securities which can be readily turned into cash, with the exception of a piece of real estate in Anniston, Alabama. We are advised that this lot is worth at least $500.00. Mr. Robertson tells me, however, that he is reliably informed that if this lot is properly handled, more than $500.00 may be realized from it. I will recommend that a resolution be adopted at this meeting constituting the Rector and the Chairman of the Executive Committee a special Committee of two, with full power to sell this property, cae being taken to phrase the resolution so that authority will also be given the Rector to convey in case of a sale. In conclusion I will add that much credit is due both to Mr. Robertson and to Judge Fletcher in saving for the University such of this estate as now remains, for I am confident that had it not been for their efforts practically the whole fund would have been lost. Respectfully submitted, W. Allan Perkins. Nove. 26th, 1918.</field>
