This is the replacement to succeed Assistant Professor Phineas P. Wright who resigned the latter part of December. RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mrs. Sarah Vernon Hodges be and she is hereby elected substitute Instructor in Dramatic Arts for the remainder of the current session, at a salary of $250 a month, incumbency to begin on February 1, 1947. This is the replacement to succeed Assistant Professor Paul J. Ritter who resigned at the end of the first semester of the current session. The following report of Mrs. Wailes Committee was presented and adopted: To the Rector and Board of Visitors University of Virginia The Committee on Mary Washington met at the College on January 23, 1947. Present were Mrs. Wailes, Mrs. Willis and Judge Garnett, also the chancellor, Dr. Newcomb, President Combs, and Dean Alvey. The Committee approved the recommendations made by President Combs of salary increases for certain members of the faculty as submitted to the Board on January 10, 1947 with the following additions: Dorothy Duggan, Associate Professor of Art, from $3,011.20 to $3,311.00, and Dr. Paul Haensel, Professor of Economics, from $3,168.00 to $3,468.00. These increases amount to $599.80. However, the sum of $758.80 was released by the resignation of Dr. Paul J. Ritter, and of Mrs. Catesby W. Stewart at the end of the first semester. The increases are thus amply covered by available funds. Dean Alvey presented a report on the coordination of the college with the University, dealing with admission requirements, degree requirements, and course offerings as recommended by the Committee on the Consolidation of Mary Washington College with the University of Virginia. The Committee feels that fine progress has been made. Members of the Board were sent copies of Dean Alvey's report. The Committee is cognizant of our obligation to have Mary Washington meet the requirements for approval by accrediting agencies such as the American Association of Universities, but recommends that the request for inclusion on the approved list of this association be delayed until the conversion of Mary Washington into a liberal arts college and its consolidation with the University is completed. The proposed changes in College Avenue were viewed, but the Committee asked Judge Garnett to investigate the matter further. Brompton was also visited. A report on the status of its renovation was sent to the members of the Board. A subcommittee consisting of Mrs. Willis and the chairman met with the Mary Washington Faculty Committee on Student Guidance, and later with representatives of student organizations for a discussion of student activities. However, the subcommittee is not yet ready to make a report. Respectfully submitted Bertha Wailes, Chairman Phoebe Willis Christopher B. Garnett Mr. Perkins presented to the Board a form of proposed contract between Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia and Veterans Administration by which the College agrees to accept for instruction during the period from September 1, 1946, to June 30, 1947, inclusive, Veterans who are approved by the Veterans Administration as entitled to Vocational Rehabilitation Training under Public Law 16 Seventy-eighth Congress, and to furnish books, tools, equipment, etc., necessary for the satisfactory pursuit of the courses being given; the terms under which said Veterans are to be accepted by the College being fully set out in said contract. After consideration of said contract the following resolution, proposed by Mr. Garnett and seconded by Mr. Black unanimously adopted- RESOLVED that Morgan L. Combs, President of Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia, said College being a department of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a Virginia Corporation which owns and operates the University of Virginia and said Mary Washington College, be and is hereby authorized and directed in the name and on behalf of said Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia to execute the contract under date of January 28, 1947, between said College and Veterans Administration, a copy of which has been presented to, and considered at, this meeting. And E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, is hereby instructed to affix the corporate seal of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to said contract and to attest the same. And that said contract be and is hereby adopted as a contract of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. RESOLUTION OF CONVEYANCE: In the matter of an alleged encroachment by Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia upon Avenue C., or "College Avenue" in the City of Fredericksburg, it was Resolved that the Attorney for the University of Virginia is hereby instructed to prepare a deed by which the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia will convey to the City of Fredericksburg any and all right and interest which the University of Virginia has in that certain real property located in the City of Fredericksburg and described as follows: Beginning at a point in the southeast boundary of College Avenue, in the City of Fredericksburg, 115 feet northwest of the northwest boundary of 4th Street, thence northwestardly along a line parallel to and 60 feet from the southwest boundary of College Avenue as laid out by the Fredericksburg Development Company in 1891, a distance of 2,310 feet to the southeast boundary of United States Alternate No. 1 Highway, thence southwestwardly along the southeast boundary of said highway a distance of 238 feet to the corner of the Mary Washington College property, thence southeastwardly a distance of 2,285 feet to the beginning, containing 0.79 of an acre. This conveyance having been authorized by an Act of the General Assembly of Virginia at its special session in January, 1947. And be it further Resolved that Dr. J. L. Newcomb, President, is hereby authorized to execute said deed in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and E. I. Carruthers, Secretary, is hereby instructed to affix the corporate seal thereto, attest the same, and deliver said deed to the City of Fredericksburg. RENOVATION OF BROMPTON: The work at Brompton is progressing fairly satisfactorily, especially in view of the difficulty in securing materials and equipment. The work on one of the slave quarters is entirely complete with the exception of exterior painting and the finishing plaster. All of the demolition work on the main residence was completed sometime ago. The brick walls have been repaired, chimneys rebuilt, and the back part of the frame structure, including the dining hall, kitchen, and porch, has been entirely rebuilt. All the joists, sills, and the like have been replaced. The plumbing, heating, and electrical work in the main building are practically complete. The sub-floors have been laid, and a good deal of the plastering laths have been installed. Many of the windows which were in bad condition have been repaired or replaced. The remainder of the millwork has been done and ready to be installed. New rafters have been replaced wherever necessary. The sheathing for the roof is completed and they are now waiting for the slate. The Superintendent on the project estimates that the construction on the main residence and the two slave quarters is approximately 65 per cent complete. To date the college has spent $34,000 on this work. This figure, however, includes all materials and equipment on the job which have not been installed. The meeting then adjourned. E. R.

The Committee approved the recommendations made by President Combs of salary increases for certain members of the faculty as submitted to the Board on January 10, 1947 with the following additions: Dorothy Duggan, Associate Professor of Art, from $3,011.20 to $3,311.00, and Dr. Paul Haensel, Professor of Economics, from $3,168.00 to $3,468.00. These increases amount to $599.80. However, the sum of $758.80 was released by the resignation of Dr. Paul J. Ritter, and of Mrs. Catesby W. Stewart at the end of the first semester. The increases are thus amply covered by available funds. Dean Alvey presented a report on the coordination of the college with the University, dealing with admission requirements, degree requirements, and course offerings as recommended by the Committee on the Consolidation of Mary Washington College with the University of Virginia. The Committee feels that fine progress has been made. Members of the Board were sent copies of Dean Alvey's report. The Committee is cognizant of our obligation to have Mary Washington meet the requirements for approval by accrediting agencies such as the American Association of Universities, but recommends that the request for inclusion on the approved list of this association be delayed until the conversion of Mary Washington into a liberal arts college and its consolidation with the University is completed. The proposed changes in College Avenue were viewed, but the Committee asked Judge Garnett to investigate the matter further. Brompton was also visited. A report on the status of its renovation was sent to the members of the Board. A subcommittee consisting of Mrs. Willis and the chairman met with the Mary Washington Faculty Committee on Student Guidance, and later with representatives of student organizations for a discussion of student activities. However, the subcommittee is not yet ready to make a report. Respectfully submitted Bertha Wailes, Chairman Phoebe Willis Christopher B. Garnett</field>
