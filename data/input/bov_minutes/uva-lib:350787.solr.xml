      <field name="fulltext">1 February 1958 A called meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia was held on this date at 10:00 A.M. in the Office of the President of the University, at Charlottesville, with the following present. The Rector, Frank Talbott, Jr., President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., and Visitors Berkeley, Bryan, Coxe, Emmett, Gravatt, Jones, Martin, Pollock, Mr. Smith, and Wheeler. Absent: Visitors Gray, Greear, Hartfield, McWane, Paschall, and Mrs. Smith. The minutes of the meeting of 14 December 1957, previously distributed, were approved. RETIRING VISITORS In reporting to the Board the unavoidable absence of Mrs. Emily P. Smith, the Rector expressed his keen personal and official regret at the retirement from the Board, as of the close of today's meeting, of Mrs. Smith, Dr. John M. Emmett, and Mr. J. Segar Gravatt. President Darden joined in the appreciation of the Board for their unselfish service for the maximum terms permitted by statute. EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE DEPUTIZED TO ACT FOR BOARD The Rector pointed out that the urgent matter of the choice of a permanent site for the Northern Virginia College would require the full time of the Board at today's meeting. In addition to that matter, he intended to present only a resolution from the Faculty of the Clinch Valley College, but would ask the President to present the matter of the bids for the new Hospital construction. He recommended that all other items on today's agenda, as laid before the Board in the President's docket, be referred to the Executive Committee for study and action in detail. The Board accordingly resolved that the Executive Committee be authorized, pursuant to Section 23-75 Code of Virginia, to act in the name of the Board of Visitors on all matters in today's docket not otherwise disposed of by the full Board, and to act with the same authority upon any matters which the President might see fit to refer to the Committee between today's date and the meeting of the Board scheduled to be held in Fredericksburg on 12 April 1958. The Secretary was instructed to record all actions of the Executive Committee under this resolution as actions of the Board in the minutes of today's meeting or of the April 12th meeting, as might be appropriate. A signed statement detailing the Committee's decisions was subsequently filed with the Secretary's notes on today's meeting, whereby the Executive Committee approved on behalf of the Board the following matters under the headings "Gifts and Grants", "Elections", "Cancellation of Election", "Appointment", "Leave of Absence", "Resignation", "Military Property Custodian", and "Clinch Valley College Fees", and the resolutions, respectively, pertaining thereto.

CLINCH VALLEY COLLEGE FEES INCREASED President Darden reported on his correspondence with the Governor regarding fees and revenue estimates at the Clinch Valley College, and presented the following memorandum from the Provost UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Charlottesville January 30, 1958 Office of the Provost The Rotunda MEMORANDUM TO President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. FROM J. L. Vaughan I think we should ask the Board for permission to go ahead with some slight increases in fees at Clinch Valley College to make increases in faculty salaries to bring them in line with proposed increases at Mary Washington, Longwood, etc. Mr. Smiddy, Mr. Shea, and I have reviewed the situation and think that, by increasing the charge per semester-hour from $8.50 to $9.50 for college and education courses, and from $12.00 to $12.50 for engineering courses, and including $10 for library fees and $10 for activity fees, we feel we can make the necessary increases and promotions which will amount to $7,300. In my judgment, we must make the increases if we are to retain our present staff and attract new people to this rather remote area. As calculated by Mr. Shea, the financial situation at Clinch Valley looks like this 1958-59 1959-60 Projected Income $ 81,000 $ 88,000 State Appropriation 76,650 78,185 Total $157,650 $166,185 Minimum Budget $157,504 $160,234 V/c cc: Mr. Vincent Shea Mr. J. C. Smiddy /s/ J. L. Vaughan It was resolved that the fees be increased as set forth above in the Provost's memorandum. MR. DARDEN'S NAME - CLINCH VALLEY RESOLUTION The Rector read to the Board the following resolution, which had been received from Professor Judd W. Lewis, Jr. RESOLUTION At a regular meeting of the Faculty of Clinch Valley College of the University of Virginia held at the college in Wise, Virginia on Wednesday, December 18, 1957, and presided over by Professor Judd W. Lewis, Jr., Chairman, this Faculty voted upon and passed the following resolution THAT WHEREAS, the President of the University of Virginia, Mr. Colgate W. Darden, Jr., having rendered outstanding service in the establishment and the perpetuation of Clinch Valley College, THAT WHEREAS, Mr. Darden gave, not only of his time, but of his personal means in helping to establish this institution, NOW, THEREFORE, be it resolved that the Faculty of Clinch Valley College of the University of Virginia do hereby recommend that the new academic building to be built at Clinch Valley College be named Darden Hall, WHEREFORE, the said Faculty at Clinch Valley College of the University of Virginia does hereby request that this resolution be placed before the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia at its next meeting, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be sent to Mr. Francis L. Berkeley, Secretary of the Board of Visitors, Alderman Library Building, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia. /s/ Judd W. Lewis, Jr. Judd W. Lewis, Jr., Chairman Faculty, Clinch Valley College of the University of Virginia President Darden expressed his warm appreciation for the generous sentiments of the College Faculty. He stated, however, that he was strongly and unalterably opposed to having any building on any campus of the University of Virginia named after him now or at any time in the future. The Board accordingly resolved, in deference to the President's wishes, that the Secretary convey to the Faculty of Clinch Valley College of the University of Virginia the thanks of the Visitors, their hearty concurrence in the sentiments of the Faculty toward Mr. Colgate W. Darden, Jr., and their regret that they cannot approve the naming of the new academic building in honor of Mr. Darden. NORTHERN VIRGINIA COLLEGE SITE APPROVED The Rector opened a three-hour discussion of the problem of a permanent site for the University's Northern Virginia College, now occupying a former public school building at Bailey's Cross Roads, by asking whether the Board desired to hear further testimony by representatives from Northern Virginia civic organizations and local governments. The governmental representatives present this morning, Mr. Talbott noted, included officials favoring each of the only two sites remaining under consideration, the Ravensworth tract and the Sunset Hills tract, near Herndon, the citizens and officials supporting both sides had expressed themselves as willing to forego the hearings, but only on condition that no opposing witness should appear before the Board. Members pointed out that the two sites now finally available were essentially the same two sites on which the Board's special committee had made a study and report in September 1956, and upon which the full Board had subsequently held extensive hearings. It was also pointed out that many official and unofficial communications were on the table and that further hearings would only distract attention from the study of these and other documents, maps, and exhibits, and from adequate deliberation upon the merits of the two sites. On motion of Dr. Emmett, duly seconded, the Board RESOLVED that no hearings be held unless developments later in the day should call for them, but with freedom reserved to call in anyone needed to clarify a question. The Secretary, as instructed, informed Mr. C. Harrison Mann and other waiting witnesses of the foregoing decision, and requested that they remain on call by telephone. The Secretary having previously furnished to each Visitor a description of Ravensworth and copies of Mr. C. Harrison Mann's letter of 30 January 1958 (as amended on February 1st) offering and requesting approval, on behalf of the Board of Control for the Establishment of a Northern Virginia Branch College, of Ravensworth tracts comprising 209 acres, the Rector also read to the Board numerous telegrams, letters, and other documents, including the individual offers of land. Noting that some of the land offers at Ravensworth promised delivery over a three-year period, the Board instructed the Secretary to obtain by telephone a clarification from Mr. Mann. This was done, and Mr. Mann explained that clear titles would be available, but that installment payments would be necessary to protect the owners from tax losses. The Joint House Resolution of 27 February 1956 authorizing the branch in Northern Virginia was read and explained to the Board by the Rector. President Darden read to the Board a letter of 30 January 1958 from Paul H. Farrier, Secretary of the State Council of Higher Education, containing the following resolution adopted by the Council on January 27th: In view of the information presented to the Council, and in view of a VALC recommendation that junior colleges without dormitories be located in centers of heavy population, the Council approves the location of such an institution in Northern Virginia at the Ravensworth site as recommended by the governing bodies of Alexandria, Falls Church, Arlington County, and Fairfax County, and by the legally established local board of control. This approval by the Council is subject to the acceptance of Ravensworth site by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia at its next meeting called for this purpose, or at any adjourned meeting thereof. The Rector also read to the Board a letter from Paul H. Farrier, Executive Secretary of the State Council of Higher Education, dated January 30, 1958, in which Mr. Farrier pointed out that in two recent reports the Virginia Advisory Legislative Council had stated that branch institutions should be established in areas of high population density. The Rector noted that the Board had received no official messages from any of the four governing bodies in the tenth district, except Arlington, and that Mr. C. Harrison Mann had overlooked bringing the messages with him to Charlottesville, as he had intended to do. The Rector then read to the Board the following statement signed by Mr. Mann in the Secretary's presence this morning I certify that the four governing bodies, Arlington, Alexandria, Falls Church and Fairfax County have each passed resolutions authorizing the Board of Control to acquire the Ravensworth site for a branch college. Further, that each of the governing bodies has agreed to place in its budget for the ensuing year its proportionate share of funds necessary to acquire this site for the establishment of a branch college. At Mr. Gravatt's request the Secretary read to the Board the Board's resolutions of 14 December 1957 approving as acceptable sites the Chiles tract, the Brenizer tract, and the Bowman tract at Sunset Hills, and authorizing the Executive Committee to act for the Board during December and January, either in acceptance of one of these sites or in negotiating an extension of the Bowman offer, which had since been extended and doubled. The very extensive discussion that followed brought out the opinions already announced by the Advisory Council, the local governments in and near the Tenth District, the Board of Control, and the Council of Higher Education, as well as the sharply divided public opinion in Northern Virginia. Emphasis was put upon transportation problems, the availability of metropolitan universities and the cost differentials, educational costs at non-dormitory institutions, the freedom of the Board (under the General Assembly) to establish the branch either within or beyond the bounds of the Tenth District, the problem of local financial support, projected highway developments and population trends (especially as analyzed and presented by the late Dr. Dowell Howard, now modified by the new airport near Herndon), expansion space, and the dangers of future pressures for a four-year branch college. The Rector proposed, the Board concurring, that in reaching a decision the Visitors should follow three broad rules: (1) Ignore all pressures, (2) Ignore purely esthetic considerations since both sites now considered by the Board offer the protection of reasonably adequate acreage and since the institution will not be a dormitory college, and (3) Be guided solely by best judgment, in the light of all the evidence, to choose the site that will best serve Northern Virginia now and in future President Darden spoke in favor of the Ravensworth tract, emphasizing the concurring decisions reached, after long and arduous efforts of Board of Control members and others, by the local governments on which the University must depend. He pointed out that most students would be expected to come from the Tenth District and would find Ravensworth much more accessible. He referred also to Dr. Lancaster's concern and the opinions reached by the Council of Higher Education. Others stressed the advantages of the Sunset Hills location for the long-range future, and reminded the Board of the studies of the late Dr. Dowell Howard of the high schools and future developments in Northern Virginia which made him such a strong advocate of the Sunset Hills site. Judge Smith, who said he had formerly favored a somewhat rural site, questioned whether it was practicable to attempt to proceed at this time. Judge Bryan expressed similar doubts, despite his preference for the Sunset Hills location. The Rector pointed to state policy for creating a Northern Virginia college now, as reflected in the General Assembly's resolution, and others said they believed that if the Visitors made a firm decision, based on their mature convictions, that the Northern Virginians would ultimately support the project Upon motion of Mr. Gravatt, seconded by Dr. Martin, the Board adopted by a 9 to 2 vote (Messrs. Coxe and Talbott dissenting) the following resolution RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Board approves and stands ready to accept as a permanent site for the Northern Virginia College of the University of Virginia the 500-acre tract (with use of the proposed sewage disposal plant) offered by Mr. A. Smith Bowman, Jr., Mr. L. DeLong Bowman, and A. Smith Bowman &amp; Sons, Inc., together with the gift of forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00) offered by the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County. BRANCHES TO BE NON-DORMITORY JUNIOR COLLEGES During the discussion of the site question there had been frequent statements by the Rector, the President, Judge Smith, and several others emphasizing the conception of University branches as junior colleges without dormitories. Upon motion of Mr. Berkeley, seconded by Judge Smith, the following resolution was unanimously adopted RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Board wishes to record its deep conviction that the Northern Virginia College and all other branch colleges now existing or that may be established in future as colleges of the University of Virginia ought to be non-residential colleges limited to the first two years of undergraduate work. On motion the meeting was then adjourned. Frank Talbott, Jr. Rector Francis L. Berkeley Secretary</field>
      <field name="fulltext">UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Charlottesville January 30, 1958 Office of the Provost The Rotunda MEMORANDUM TO President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. FROM J. L. Vaughan I think we should ask the Board for permission to go ahead with some slight increases in fees at Clinch Valley College to make increases in faculty salaries to bring them in line with proposed increases at Mary Washington, Longwood, etc. Mr. Smiddy, Mr. Shea, and I have reviewed the situation and think that, by increasing the charge per semester-hour from $8.50 to $9.50 for college and education courses, and from $12.00 to $12.50 for engineering courses, and including $10 for library fees and $10 for activity fees, we feel we can make the necessary increases and promotions which will amount to $7,300. In my judgment, we must make the increases if we are to retain our present staff and attract new people to this rather remote area. As calculated by Mr. Shea, the financial situation at Clinch Valley looks like this 1958-59 1959-60 Projected Income $ 81,000 $ 88,000 State Appropriation 76,650 78,185 Total $157,650 $166,185 Minimum Budget $157,504 $160,234 V/c cc: Mr. Vincent Shea Mr. J.
