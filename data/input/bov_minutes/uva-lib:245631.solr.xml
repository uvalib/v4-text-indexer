Resolved that permission be granted to Professor Tucker to extend the term of his absence in his contemplated voyage to Europe as late as the first day of October next without the forfeiture of any o the emoluments there unto attached; upon condition however that he shall deliver to his classes a full course of lectures between the period of his return and the end of the next session.

Resolved that the Faculty be authorised to take the special circumstances of Mr. Harris' case into their consideration &amp; if they be satisfied, notwithstanding Mr. Harris' failure in his examinations, that he really possesses the knowledge of Mathematics which, manifested in the usual mode, would entitle him to a diploma in that school, they be empowered to grant him such diploma. 5. Resolved that the Proctor be instructed to pay the accounts of Gales &amp; Seaton amounting to $18 for advertising in the years 1828 &amp; 1829, and that of G. W.

Western Range during the next session, having been laid before the Board, Resolved that the Letter of Mr. Wilson be referred to the faculty with authority to act in the case according to their discretion. 8.
