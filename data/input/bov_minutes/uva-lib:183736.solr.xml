      <field name="fulltext">SUMMARY OF BOARD ACTION ON THE REPORT OF THE PROXY ADVISORY COMMITTEE DATED MARCH 17, 1987 Mr. Carl Smith, Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Board of Visitors, made the following statement: I hand you a copy of the Board of Visitors' response to the Proxy Advisory Committee report of March 17, 1987 and the resolution of the Student Council and wish to inform you that this response has been approved unanimously by the Board. We have made a thorough evaluation of the Report of the Proxy Advisory Committee and Council's resolution. While abhorring the system of racial injustice in South Africa, we must consider all aspects of the problem. This includes protecting the financial well being of the University and its endowment. One point of emphasis is that we strongly endorse the Proxy Committee's March 17th position to "support education of non-white South Africans." We are reaffirming the policy of selective divestment. The Board is convinced we have made an objective evaluation of a complex situation and by this action, are steering the proper course for the University. The question of divestment will not be considered further by the Board unless there has been a material change in conditions surrounding this issue. Carl W. Smith, Chairman, Finance Committee</field>
      <field name="fulltext">STATEMENT OF THE BOARD ON THE REPORT OF THE PROXY ADVISORY COMMITTEE DATED MARCH 17, 1987 The following statement was unanimously approved by the Board of Visitors: Deep concern in the University community about the system of racial injustice in South Africa has been fully shared by the Board of Visitors, even before the President established the Proxy Advisory Committee in 1982. The Board deeply regrets and strongly condemns the continuation of apartheid, as an intolerable and inhumane set of relations among races and peoples. There is no disagreement about apartheid. Differences exist with respect to responses to the system, including the effectiveness and appropriateness of divestiture of securities of companies doing business in South Africa. After careful study of this question and after considering the views of students, faculty and alumni, the Board continues to believe that complete and total divestment would in itself raise significant concerns of fairness and consistency, apart from risk to the University's capacity to fulfill its central mission. The Board has reviewed, with benefit and appreciation, the thoughtful report of the Proxy Advisory Committee submitted on March 17, 1987 to the President. That review has confirmed the Board's earlier judgment that total divestment would not be responsible. Consequently, the Board reaffirms its policy of selective divestment. The Board accepts a major portion of the recommendations of the Proxy Advisory Committee and it fully shares the hope for a more active educational program with broad participation of the University community; the details of such a program are described below. The Board requests the President of the University to: 1. Establish a fund for gifts designated for use in support of scholarship and fellowship programs for non-white South Africans. The University will also contribute to the fund from non-endowment resources. 2. Establish a committee to implement this educational initiative. 3. Request Student Council to review and make recommendations to the President and the Board of Visitors on the feasibility of initiating a program permitting students to designate $1 each semester in support of the scholarship and fellowship programs for South Africa. 4. Offer a payroll deduction program for those University employees who may wish to contribute to such efforts. On the matter of selective divestment, the Board continues to recognize that in certain circumstances the University of Virginia may decide to disassociate itself from a particular company because the nature of that company's activity in South Africa is judged to involve support of the apartheid system. Such a step is a serious one, and should be taken only after a thorough and objective review of the situation. The Board has concluded that the University's ownership of stock in companies doing business in South Africa shall be governed by the following guidelines, which the President will communicate to the Proxy Advisory Committee for consideration during its review of such companies: 1. Consistent with previously established investment guidelines, the University will not invest in companies whose primary business activity is in South Africa. 2. Companies which are non-signatories or which consistently fail to achieve satisfactory ratings according to A. D. Little or other applicable rating sources as recognized by the Finance Committee of the Board of Visitors, are automatically subject to review by the Proxy Advisory Committee. For that reason, the acquisition of additional holdings in such companies should be specifically justified in writing by any investment adviser proposing to add such holdings to the University's portfolio. 3. Companies that make sales or loans to the government of South Africa should be automatically reviewed by the Proxy Advisory Committee. Consideration should be given to the volume of such sales or loans, the degree to which they are voluntary, and whether the goods involved are specialized or generally available to the local economy. 4. The nature of a company's overall activity in South Africa should receive careful analysis. Included in that analysis should be the company's public commitment to the pursuit of racial justice and equality. The company should be taking positive steps to improve the conditions of non-whites, both inside and beyond the workplace. 5. The responsiveness of a company to inquiries from the University regarding its South African business activities should also be considered in the assessment. The final recommendation concerns the voting of proxies. The Proxy Advisory Committee should continue to review proxy issues relating to U.S. companies doing business in South Africa. It is expected that many of these proposals will urge withdrawal from or transfer of the South African operations of such companies. The Vice President for Business and Finance, after receiving and reviewing the Committee recommendations, shall continue to vote proxies on these issues. The Vice President will give careful consideration to the recommendations of the Committee. The Proxy Advisory Committee and the Vice President for Business and Finance are requested to report annually to the President prior to the May/June Board of Visitors meeting regarding recommendations made to the Vice President for Business and Finance on proxy issues and the actions taken by the Vice President. The Board of Visitors wishes to thank Committee Chairman Snook and the Proxy Advisory Committee for their many hours of thoughtful research and deliberation in studying both divestment and educational initiatives which might be taken and would ask the Proxy Advisory Committee once again to focus on the consideration of proxy issues and further study of companies operating in South Africa whose activities warrant review under the criteria set forth above. The question of divestment will not be considered further by the Board unless there has been a material change in conditions surrounding this issue.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ATTACHMENT = UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS CONTRACT WITH U.S. JET CORP. DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED CONTRACT BETWEEN THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AND U.S. JET CORPORATION WASHINGTON, D.C. BACKGROUND AND SERVICE On August 31, 1984, the University of Virginia Hospitals established a medically-equipped professionally-staffed helicopter service known as Pegasus. This highly successful service has assisted physicians in rapid transport of hundreds of patients to destinations throughout the region. Due to high utilization of this service and increased demand for long-distance transports, the University of Virginia Hospitals proposes the establishment of a critical care, Charlottesville-based Fixed-Wing Air Ambulance to service the State of Virginia and its bordering states (800-mile radius of Charlottesville). This program will allow the University of Virginia Hospitals to provide a State-wide service which is not currently available. Much of the State, excluding metropolitan areas, is remote from the facilities of a major medical center with Level I trauma center designation. It has been demonstrated through national studies, and our own program, Pegasus, that air ambulances allow faster response times than do ground ambulances to calls more than fifteen minutes travel distance. For shorter distances, the ground ambulances have more favorable response times. The same concept is true regarding fixed-wing transports. The helicopter transport service, Pegasus, is very efficient within a radius of 150 miles of Charlottesville, but becomes more inefficient with regard to costs and response time beyond the 150-mile radius. A fixed-wing aircraft is faster and more efficient between the 150-800 mile range. The proposed air ambulance service will make a rapid response critical care air ambulance available to all citizens of the Commonwealth who require medical care, regardless of their ability to pay. The proposed fixed-wing transportation service addresses the following regional needs: 1. The need for rapid transportation of seriously-ill patients to an appropriate health care facility. 2. The provision of sophisticated intensive emergency care during the transportation of a critically-ill patient to a hospital. 3. Providing the benefits of a major medical center to those areas without such care, using the fixed-wing transportation service. 4. Providing the above benefits without regard to a person's ability to pay. At present, there is no immediate response hospital-based fixed-wing air ambulance service in the State of Virginia. The University of Virginia Hospitals proposes to provide an immediate response medical flight service program which will serve as a primary response vehicle to areas of the Commonwealth which are not feasible for rotor-wing access due to weather and distance considerations. The University of Virginia's helicopter program, Pegasus, has had success during the first three years of operation and has transported over 1,500 patients. However, Pegasus has not responded to requests for helicopter evacuation nearly 600 times due to weather conditions. We have missed approximately 400 flights because of flights-in-progress, about 90 flights due to maintenance requirements. The availability of a dedicated fixed-wing aircraft will significantly reduce the missed calls due to weather and virtually eliminate missed calls due to flights-in-progress and maintenance. In addition, the fixed-wing aircraft will serve as an alternative to Pegasus and the Newborn Emergency Transport Service (NETS) for long-distance flights (150 nautical miles), therefore establishing a two-component system which all transports from 0-150 mile radius of Charlottesville would be handled by the rotor-wing aircraft and transports from 150-500 mile radius of Charlottesville will be assigned to the fixed-wing service. This two-component system would be highly cost effective and provide total access to a medical facility to anyone in the Commonwealth. The air ambulance will be based at the Charlottesville/Albemarle Airport and staffed by a specialty transport team consisting of critical care nurses, nationally registered paramedics, and IFR-certified pilots. The aircraft and crew would be capable of responding within 30 minutes from the request for service for any of the following needs: on-scene transport (local squad transporting the patient to the local airport), transport of drugs and supplies to disaster or major incident areas, organ transport, and interhospital treatment of patients. The fixed-wing aircraft will be capable of landing in any one of over 50 airports within the Commonwealth, virtually providing multiple service capabilities to anyone in the Commonwealth within one hour. BIDDERS Five (5) companies (Corporate Jet, Aeromed International, U. S. Jet Aviation, Atlantic West Aviation, Class 1 Aviation) submitted proposals to the University in response to our R.F.P. The low bidder was Medical Air Rescue Company of Rapid City, South Dakota. Due to financial difficulties of Medical Air Rescue Company's parent company, Westward Community Health Care, the second lowest bid from U.S. Jet Aviation of Washington, D.C., was selected. COST The University of Virginia wishes to lease for a period of two years a fixed-wing service from U.S. Jet, Inc., Washington, D.C. The service will provide the University with six (6) pilots, a twin-engine Beechcraft King Air C-90 and a back-up Beechcraft King Air B-90 (to be utilized when the primary aircraft is not available due to maintenance) equipped with: oxygen, air, suction, adult and pediatric monitor and defribillator, neonatal isolette, oxygen blender and ventilator, doppler monitoring, and non-invasive blood pressure monitoring equipment. The cost of this service is $30,000.00 per month and $385.00 per hour flown and includes the following: 6 Pilots Beechcraft King Air C-90 Intensive Care Unit Package A Back-up King Air B-90 (to replace the Beechcraft C-90 when maintenance is required) All Aircraft Maintenance Hangar Facilities Total yearly cost including medical personnel is $550,000.00. This cost, based upon 200 patients per year, is supported totally by revenue generated from the service. APPROVAL The University requests Board of Visitors approval to contract with U.S. Jet Corporation subject to the review and approval of contract documents by the Legal Adviser's Office and University Management.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ATTACHMENT B = UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL CONTRACT WITH ARA SERVICES DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED CONTRACT BETWEEN THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AND ARA SERVICES BACKGROUND For several years, the University of Virginia Hospital has had a dual food service operation in confined contiguous areas. The University Food Service operated the cafeteria with support from their food center on Ivy Road and less than adequate support and production space on-site. The Hospital operated the patient food production and distribution from the main kitchen. The Replacement Hospital is scheduled to come on line with a large modern cafeteria and new methods of patient food production and distribution. These anticipated changes brought on by the Replacement Hospital along with the inefficiencies of our current setup, as well as complaints with quality and service from our cafeteria, generated a management decision to unify food production, distribution, cafeteria and catering services into a contractually provided service. A Request for Proposal was developed and targeted at nationally recognized companies with experience in serving major teaching hospitals preferably with resources and experience in opening and operating new facilities within our current planning and budget forecasts. The University Hospital was successful in attracting the interests of seven companies that met its requirements, of which three competitive proposals were received. Negotiations with these three vendors were accomplished, and ARA was selected. CONVERSION TO CONTRACT SERVICE The negotiated contract provides for the protection of the Hospital's current employees as long as they provide satisfactory service. Upon attrition and to meet current vacancies created by the withdrawal of University Food Service, ARA will staff with ARA employees. The cafeteria will operate 24 hours/day, 7 days/week with a full service menu for our off-hour employees. ARA will buy through ARA or State of Virginia resources, whichever is in the best interests of the Hospital. The Hospital will control the menu offerings, quality, prices charged in the cafeteria and the performance of ARA employees. PRICE ARA has accepted this for a management contract fee of $52,000 per year and costs. The costs (including the management fee) are constrained to the established budget for the year. As an incentive to improve efficiencies and performance, a bonus plan is included. Should ARA come in under the budget, the savings will be shared 10% for ARA and 90% for the Hospital. Should they be able to increase volume in the cafeteria, the increase would also be shared in like manner. Because of technicalities of maximizing the benefits of ARA purchasing outside the State purchasing constraints and to not have ARA considered as "agents" of the Hospital, the total dollar volume of the contract may be as much as $3,000,000/year, related to patient volume. However, the specific value to ARA will be considerably less, more in the range of $150,000, related to the management fee and the bonuses from increased volumes and savings. APPROVAL The University requests Board of Visitors approval to contract with ARA subject to the review and approval of contract documents by the Legal Adviser's Office and University Management.</field>
