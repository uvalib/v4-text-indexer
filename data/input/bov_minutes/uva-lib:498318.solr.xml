      <field name="fulltext">TENTATIVE MINUTES SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE BOARD OF VISITORS October 4-5, 2002 The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met, in Open Session, at 8:30 a.m., Friday, October 4, 2002, in the East Oval Room of the Rotunda; John P. Ackerly, III, Rector, presided. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr., William G. Crutchfield, Jr., Thomas F. Farrell, II, Charles L. Glazer, William H. Goodwin, Jr., T. Keister Greer, Mark J. Kington, Don R. Pippin, Gordon F. Rainey, Jr., Terence P. Ross, Thomas A. Saunders, III, Warren M. Thompson, Ms. Elizabeth A. Twohy, E. Darracott Vaughan, Jr., M.D., and H. Timothy Lovelace, Jr., were present. Present as well were John T. Casteen, III, Leonard W. Sandridge, Alexander G. Gilliam, Jr., Paul J. Forch, Gene D. Block, Ms. Colette Sheehy, Robert D. Sweeney, Robert E. Reynolds, M.D., Ms. Yoke San Reynolds, R. Ariel Gomez, M.D., William W. Harmon, Ms. Patricia Lampkin, and Ms. Jeanne Flippo Bailes. (The Board had met briefly, as the full Board, the previous afternoon, October 3rd, at The University of Virginia's College at Wise. See the separate Minutes of that meeting.) The Rector opened the meeting and asked Mr. Glazer to lead the Board in the Pledge of Allegiance. The Minutes of the meetings of May 31-June 2, and July 1213, were approved. The Rector read to the Board the annual certification, required by the Atlantic Coast Conference, that the President is responsible for the direction of athletics programs at the University. The persistent drought in Charlottesville has necessitated action by the University to conserve water. A previous drought in 1998 led to the creation of a University committee to deal with the problem, and this committee has continued its work through the present water shortage. The Rector, and the President, noted that the committee has done outstanding work in finding ways to conserve water. The Rector introduced the members of the committee, known as the UVa Drought Management Team: Ms. Cheryl Gomez and Messrs. William Cromwell, Robert Dillman, David Hudson, David Gipson, Richard Kovatch, and Anthony Motto (Mr. Kovatch could not be present). At the Rector's request, Ms. Gomez, the Chair of the group, addressed the Board briefly on the work of the Team. The Rector thanked Messrs. Crutchfield, Goodwin and Saunders for providing the aircraft used to transport the Board to Wise on October 3rd. The Rector noted that he and Mr. Rainey have asked the Young Alumni Council to work with the Board to help strengthen the fraternity and sorority system at the University. The Council will report on this at the January meeting of the Board. The President then gave his customary report. He commented briefly on the state budget crisis before noting that in the most recent U.S. News and World Report ranking, released on September 13th, the University is still rated the number two public institution. The University's overall ranking, however, has dropped two spots to 23rd. The primary factor in this decline, he said, is faculty resources — the University's ranking in this category has dropped from 28th last year to 35th this year, and will continue to drop with the lack of funding for faculty salary increases. Citing several awards that have come to the University, the President said that for the second year in a row, a member of the faculty has received a MacArthur Foundation "genius award:" Dr. Janine Jagger of the School of Medicine. Mr. David A. Harrison, III (College '39, Law '41) of Prince George, died in June and bequeathed ?64million to the University. Of this, ?34.8million is for the endowment of professorships in Law, ?20.3million for faculty support in the School of Medicine, ?5.8million for athletics, and ?3.1million to the University Library for the Harrison Institute for American History, Literature, and Culture. In addition, Mr. Harrison created an irrevocable trust in excess of ?50million, which will come to the University in twenty five years. With these gifts, the benefactions of Mr. Harrison and his late wife, Mary, to the University come to more than ?150million. The President also noted the deaths, in the last few months, of three friends of the University: Mr. Bayard Sharp (College '36), Mrs. Oleda Casscells (Law '49) and Ms. Avis Pringle. The President concluded his remarks with his usual Gifts and Grants Report. In the Fiscal Year which ended on June 30th, private giving to the University and its related foundations totaled ?255million, which was a record single-year amount and ?65.1million above the previous Fiscal Year. Significant new pledges made since the June meeting of the Board include an anonymous promise of ?5million to assist with the funding of the Carr's Hill Arts Grounds, and ?1.6million to the Miller Center Foundation from the Scripps Foundation. This latter gift was provided through the Scripps Foundation by Mrs. Elizabeth Scripps Harvey and her husband, Jeremy G. Harvey. On motion, the Gifts and Grants Report was accepted by the Board. -------------- On behalf of the Wise community, Mr. Pippin thanked his colleagues on the Board for traveling to The University of Virginia's College at Wise the previous day. The Board's visit, he said, meant a great deal to everyone at the College. The Board adjourned at 9:15 a.m., to go into Committee meetings. -------------- The Board resumed in Open Session at 2:15 p.m., Friday, October 4th, and after adopting the following motions, went into Executive Session. All Members present at the opening session were present.

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia go into Executive Session to evaluate fundraising and gift development for the proposed Arena, and to consider a specific gift involving a trust and appropriate recognition of a University benefactor, as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (4) (6) and (8) of the Code of Virginia. -------------- The Board went back into Open Session at 4:00 p.m., and recessed to continue its meeting in the Dome Room of the Rotunda.
