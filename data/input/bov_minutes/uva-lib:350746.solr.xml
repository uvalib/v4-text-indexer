BLUE CROSS The President reported that he was still not satisfied with the present Blue Cross contract, and he thought the University Hospital and other hospitals had subsidized the Blue Cross long enough and that we should receive full reimbursement for services rendered.

Whereupon, a resolution was adopted carrying out the recommendations of the President. UNCOLLECTIBLE HOSPITAL ACCOUNTS The Board adopted the following resolution.

NCAA The President read the following letter from Mr. Tebell, Director of Athletics UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Department of Athletics Charlottesville, Virginia February 7, 1953 Mr. Colgate W. Darden, Jr. President University of Virginia Charlottesville, Virginia Dear Mr. Darden I would like to reassert my position in respect to NCAA. I believe it is imperative that we maintain our membership in the organization and that we live with its rules and regulations without any attempt to by-pass them. The NCAA membership includes all the schools with which we wish to continue athletic relations. A nod from NCAA and no member institution would play us if we were a non-member or a member not in compliance. By and large, the rules are good and for our protection. I see no reason why we cannot abide by them. They leave to us, in the last analysis, the control and responsibility for the conduct of our intercollegiate program. The NCAA people have spent years in studying athletic problems and are in the best position for our guidance. I earnestly recommend that we continue with NCAA. Thanking you for this consideration, I am Respectfully yours, /s/ Gus K. Tebell Director of Athletics - - - - - - - - - - The President read a letter from the President of the Savannah Alumni Association, Georgia, endorsing the findings of the Athletic Committee of the Academic Faculty, as appointed March 28, 1951 The Rector reminded the Athletic Committee that the question of conforming to the NCAA code had been referred by the Board to this committee at its February meeting. The Chairman of this committee, Mr. Talbott, reported that amendments to the NCAA code had not been received until Tuesday of this week, hence, the committee has not had a chance to consider the matter The President reported that he had received a letter from Dean Lewis in which the Dean stated that the Academic Faculty was concerned with the action of the Board in its creation of the Advisory Council on Athletics and requested the President to meet with the Academic Faculty and to invite members of the Board, at a convenient time. The President stated that since receiving the letter, he had talked with Dean Lewis and believed there was a misunderstanding which could be cleared up by a discussion of the matter, and he would meet with the Academic Faculty as soon as the Board had taken final action to conform with the NCAA Code. ATHLETIC CONTRACTS The President reported that, upon the recommendation of the Director of Athletics, he had appointed Grover Jones and Harrison Nesbit assistant coaches of the football team, under one year contracts. LAW SCHOOL SALARIES The President reported that he had received a letter from Mr. Stuart B. Campbell, President of the Law Alumni Association, requesting that the Board hear a committee of the Law Alumni at its April meeting, looking toward the establishment of a higher salary scale for the Law Faculty. After discussion of the matter, the Board agreed to hear the Law Alumni and requested the President to so inform Mr. Campbell. The President pointed out that the New York Alumni had established a Law School Foundation, the major purpose would be to supplement the salaries of the Law School Faculty by annual giving, and he believed this might be a solution to the problem. MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE MATTERS BOARD MEETING The Rector reported that Mary Washington planned to dedicate its Fine Arts Center on Saturday, May 9. It was proposed to shift the Mary Washington meeting from April to May with the hope that as many Board members as possible would remain over for the dedication the following day. The Governor was to present the Center and The Rector would accept it on behalf of the College. A resolution was adopted approving this change. - - - - - - - - - On motion the meeting was then adjourned. Barron F. Black Rector Vincent Shea Secretary</field>
