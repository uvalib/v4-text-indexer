The Board of Visitors are without authority to make adeed to any of the University's real estate. Yours very truly, (signed) E. I. Carruthers, Secretary. The Committee on Alumni Scholarships, appointed at the June 1916 meeting of the General Alumni Association recommended to the Board the regulations with reference to Alumni Scholarships in this University, which was adopted as follows: ALUMNI SCHOLARSHIPS. 1. These scholarships shall be known as Alumni Scholarships. 2. Every Alumni Chapter, twenty-five per cent of whose local alumni are active members of the General Alumni Association (provided that such percentage equals ten alumni or more), shall be entitled annually to have one appointee at the University. 3. Every Alumni Chapter, twenty-five per cent of whose local alumni are active members of the General Alumni Association (provided that such percentage equals fifty alumni or more), shall be entitled annually to have two appointees at the University; and for every fifty members in excess of the first fifty above mentioned, each chapter shall be entitled to an additional appointee. 4. By "active" members as herein used, is meant alumni of the University, who have been admitted by the General Alumni Association as active members, thereof, in accordance with the rules laid down by the General Alumni Association. But graduation in any department or school of the University is not hereby required. 5. Every Alumni Chapter shall anounce each year in its local daily papers the nature and conditions of the scholarship, and shall request applicants to present proper credentials to the Secretary of the Chapter. 6. Only such persons may be appointed as actually stand in need of such aid and who cannot otherwise attend the University. Each applicant for a scholarship, as well as his parent or guardian, must file statement in writing that the applicant actually stands in need of such aid. No student will be permitted to enjoy the privileges of an alumni scholarship while holding an endowed scholarship or fellowship, or while carried on the salaried list of the University as assistant or instructor in any department. 7. The incumbent must be at least sixteen years of age, and must be one who, in the judgment of the Chapter naming him, is studious and of good moral character. He must make application on a blank form provided by the Secretary of the General Alumni Association. He shall be subject to the same entrance requirements as other students. 8. The final appointment of each incumbent shall be made by the Executive Committee of the Chapter and reported to the Secretary of the General Alumni Association, on a form to be provided by him, at his office at the University not later than August 15th, preceding the opening of the session for which the incumbent is appointed. 9. These scholarships shall be confined to those courses in the Academic Schools of the University to which Virginia students are now admitted without charge under the laws of Virginia (that is, all Academic courses, save the courses in Analytical Chemistry). The scholarship shall entitle the incumbent to exemption from tuition fees in the Schools referred to except laboratory fees in general, and to the remission, if he be a Virginia, of the University fee; if he be not a Virginia, one-half of the University fee. The contigent fee must be deposited in all cases. 10. No incumbent shall hold such scholarship for more than one year; but one who has passed in all his courses at the University may be eligible for reappointment the following session, upon the recommendation of the Dean. 11. In the week following August 15th., the Secretary of the General Alumni Association shall notify each Chapter which has not yet made an appointment, that in case an appointment is not made by September 1st., the President of the University and the Secretary of the General Alumni Association in conference, will fill such vacant scholarship. 12. After all necessary formalities have been complied with, the Secretary of the General Alumni Association shall report the name of the incumbent together with that of the appointing Chapter, to the Dean of the University and to the Bursar. 13. In consideration of the material aid given through these scholarships, the incumbents thereof may be called upon by the Secretary of the General Alumni Association to render to the local Chapter, the Association, and the University such reasonable assistance as lies in their power towards the advancement of University and alumni interests. The Bursar brought to the attention of the Board the matter of entering into a lease with Leonard Imboden for the rent of the central store room in the Entrance Building, and stated that Mr. Imboden had made him an offer of $1,200 per annum for the said room and had paid two monthly installments. The matter was disposed of in the following offered by Judge Norton, and adopted: RESOLVED: That the Bursar be instructed to return to Mr. Leonard Imboden, the money deposited with him by Mr. Imboden in the matter of his proposal to lease the room in the Entrance Building, with the statement that the Board declines the proposal, and that the Bursar be further instructed to send to Mr. Imboden a copy of this resolution. On motion, the meeting then adjourned. [signed] Armistead C. Gordon Rector. [signed] E. I. Carruthers Secretary.</field>
