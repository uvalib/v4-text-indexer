PATENT ON INVENTION OF DR. V. W. ARCHER Dr. Ivey F. Lewis, Chairman of the Committee on Patent Policy of the University, made a report to the Board, the substance of which is as follows - That Dr. Vincent W. Archer, Professor of Roentgenology, has made application for a patent on protective clothing for x-ray operatives, the material to be used being described by the term- "Radiant Energy Opaque Fabric". The need for such a fabric is urgent and as the details of procuring and protecting the patent, of manufacturing the fabric, and licensing its use are highly technical and require specialized and efficient management such as no department of the University is qualified to supply, the Patent Policy Committee, with the approval of Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President, requested the service of Research Corporation, a non-profit corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York, which makes a specialty of work of this character, and after three lengthy conferences with Mr. S. Blake Yates, a representative of Research Corporation, has finally agreed upon a form of contract between the University and Research and also a form of contract between Research and Dr. Vincent W. Archer. The contract in form finally agreed upon by your Committee and Research and approved by W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, is hereby presented to this Board with the unanimous recommendation of the Committee on Patent Policy of the University that said contract in its present form be executed on behalf of the University and delivered to Research for execution by it. After a discussion of the situation, the following resolution, offered by Judge Barksdale and seconded by Mr. Mears, was adopted- RESOLVED That Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President, be and is hereby authorized and directed to execute in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and in triplicate, the contract dated October 14, 1949, between the University and Research Corporation in the form presented to this meeting by Dr. Ivey F. Lewis, Chairman of the Patent Policy Committee of the University, and that Vincent Shea, Secretary, be and is hereby instructed to affix the corporate seal thereto, attest the same and deliver said contract to Research Corporation for execution on its behalf, this action being taken pursuant to report made to this meeting by Dr. Lewis, Chairman of the Patent Policy Committee as aforesaid, that said contract in the form submitted has been thoroughly studied by this Committee and approved by said Committee and by W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF FACULTY MEMBERS A resolution was adopted requesting the Rector to appoint a committee to keep informed of the accomplishments of members of the faculty and to make appropriate recommendations to the Board when such accomplishments should have recognition by the Board CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUESTS 1950-52 The Board gave approval to the following requests for capital outlay funds totaling $4,834,700 for the University Division for the biennium 1950-52 UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUESTS 1950-52 BIENNIUM University Division Equipment Furnishings for Dormitories $167,200 Furnishings for Academic Building 58,500 Equipment for Physics Building 120,000 Furnishings for Women's Dormitory 31,500 Equipment for Life Science Building 250,000 Equipment for Chemistry Building 150,000 Law Books 25,000 Total for Equipment $ 802,200 Structures Life Science Building $1,000,000 Completion of Physics Building 450,000 Reconditioning Cabell Hall 100,000 Power Plant Addition 332,500 Chemistry Building 2,000,000 Storm Sewers 45,000 Reconditioning Rouss Laboratory 100,000 Reconditioning Pavilion VII, West Lawn 5,000 Total for Structures 4,032,500 GRAND TOTAL FOR UNIVERSITY DIVISION $4,834,700 Action on a request for $9,000,000 to expand the present Hospital and Medical School was deferred pending investigation of the feasibility of establishing an entirely new Medical Center. The Rector was asked to appoint a committee to study this problem and to report to the Board at its December meeting. BRICK FOR MEN'S DORMITORIES The President stated that in the past the Board had examined panels of brick in order to decide which should be used in construction of new buildings. The Rector stated that he believed this was a field in which the Board should rely on the President and his advisors. A resolution was adopted approving the recommendations of the architects, Eggers and Higgins. TUITION FOR OUT-OF-STATE STUDENTS The question of a general increase in tuition charges assessed against out-of-state students was presented. Action was deferred until the next meeting, and the Secretary was asked to secure data on tuition charges in the various departments of the following institutions University of Alabama Harvard University University of Maryland University of North Carolina University of Pennsylvania Princeton University Tulane University Washington and Lee University Yale University LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR PRESIDENT DARDEN President Darden stated that he had been requested by the American Association of Universities to serve on a committee which will represent the Association at a conference to be held at New Delhi, India, in December. He requested leave of absence to attend this conference, and the request was granted REQUIREMENTS FOR BACHELOR'S DEGREE Mr. Gay stated that he had requested the President to furnish him with a list of the required courses for the bachelor's degree, and that nowhere on this list is there a course in American history or government. Mr. Gay feels it is essential that each student be required to take a course in American history before receiving a baccalaureate degree. The Rector was asked to appoint a committee of three to meet with the President and such members of the faculty as the President feels desirable, to study the feasibility of including a course in American history and government as a prerequisite for the bachelor's degree REPORT OF FINANCE COMMITTEE The Finance Committee presented a report to the Board, as follows, which was approved TO THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: The extent to which the Consolidated Endowment Fund is invested in marketable securities (presently aggregating the sum of $5,495,674.01) is annually reported to the Board by your Committee, and officers of its Custodian and Investment Counsel, the State-Planters Bank and Trust Company, appear and personally review such investments in order that a full understanding may be had by the Board of the manner in which the Endowment Fund is being handled. So much of the Consolidated Endowment Fund as is invested in mortgage loans is not, however, handled through the State-Planters Bank and Trust Company, but under an agreement with The Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville, acting as Custodian and service agent. A statement of the principal amounts of these mortgage loans and their maturity dates is attached hereto. It will be noted that eight of these sixteen mortgage secured loans have been made to Greek-letter fraternities having chapter houses at the University of Virginia. Pursuant to a resolution of the Board adopted at its meeting held June 1, 1946, the interest on all fraternity loans was reduced to 4 per cent as of January 1, 1942, and counsel for the University was requested to work out new contracts with each fraternity upon the basis of the balances arrived at by the application of a formula included in that resolution. Mr. Perkins has been working steadily upon this matter, and on July 6, 1949, advised your Committee that five of the eight loans had been refinanced in accordance with the wishes of the Board, and mortgage loan papers reflecting the results of his efforts are now in the hands of The Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville As of the date of Mr. Perkins' letter, a copy of which is attached hereto as information, new contracts had not been worked out with (1) Alpha Home Association of Chi Phi Fraternity, (2) Delta Kappa Epsilon Corporation, and (3) Omicron Chapter House Society of Phi Gamma Delta. Mr. Perkins advised your Committee on October 11th that he had just succeeded in completing the refinancing of Alpha Home Association of Chi Phi Fraternity, so that there now remain only two of these fraternity loans which have not been refinanced in the manner contemplated by the resolution of the Board of July 1, 1946. Mr. Perkins has had a great deal of difficulty in finding responsible representatives of these fraternities with whom to undertake negotiations, or to have them represented by independent counsel, since he of course cannot function in the matter except as counsel for the University. He has been pursuing the matter vigorously, however, and your Committee hopes to be able to report shortly that each of the eight loans now made to fraternities at the University are in current and proper form. Since this Committee was appointed by the present Rector on June 2, 1949, the following loans have been approved for the account of the Consolidated Endowment Fund (1) Charles W. Woltz, Assistant Dean of the Law School - $16,000.00. This Committee has agreed to refinance a construction loan which Mr. Woltz will arrange with some financial institution, to be secured by a mortgage upon the residence which he proposes to construct in Meadowbrook Heights, just off Dairy Road, the loan not to exceed 60 per cent of the appraised value of the property (building and grounds) after completion of the improvements, to run for a period of not more than 15 years, to bear interest at 4-1/2 per cent, if such curtails can be made monthly in an amount not to exceed 20 per cent of Mr. Woltz's fixed income after deducting fire insurance premiums, taxes and any other financial obligations he may have incurred requiring monthly or other curtails out of his income. (2) Delta Kappa Epsilon. This fraternity borrowed $6,000.00 in 1943 and the loan has now been reduced to $4,500.00. An increase in the loan in the amount of $3,000.00 has been approved by your Committee, making a total loan obligation of $7,500.00, provided curtails in the amount of $100.00 per month, with accrued interest, are made during each of the nine months of the college year. The fraternity house is insured for $25,000.00 and your Committee is informed is probably worth considerably in excess of that amount. The increase in the loan is to be used to make necessary repairs on the fraternity house. Your Committee reluctantly and regretfully declined the application of Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., a Professor at the University. Professor Berkeley requested a loan of $14,000.00 to complete the construction of a residence he had been building at 1927 Thomson Road, at an estimated cost of $20,375.00. Your Committee felt that Professor Berkeley's equity in the property was not sufficient and that his earning power and probable ability to amortize the loan over a reasonable period of time had not been sufficiently shown, to warrant the making of a loan to him in the amount requested. Respectfully submitted, (s) Frank Talbott, Jr. (s) Benj. W. Mears (s) Thomas B. Gay Chairman Finance Committee October 14, 1949 R. E. SMITHER SCHOLARSHIP PROPOSAL The Chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. Thomas B. Gay, reported that Mr. R. E. Smither desired to establish a legal scholarship, giving to the University $1,000 and twenty-four acres of land near West Point, Virginia. He proposes to finance the scholarship by the sale of timber from this land at about twenty year intervals, the $1,000 being intended to pay taxes on the land. Mr. Smither stipulates that if the proposal is accepted, the land will be held permanently by the University. The Board accepted the gift, but asked Mr. Gay to write Mr. Smither to see if a liberalization of the terms of the bequest could be secured LABURNUM REALTY CORPORATION A request from the Laburnum Realty Corporation that the University build a warehouse in Richmond as an investment was disapproved. REPORT OF ATHLETIC COMMITTEE Mr. Carrington, Chairman of the Athletic Committee, asked Judge Barksdale to state the position of the Committee in the matter of the National Collegiate Athletic Association regulations. Judge Barksdale replied that the Committee recommended that the University not resign from the NCAA, but that between now and January 1, 1950 a letter be prepared setting forth the position of the University in this matter. It is the sense of the Committee that the University go to the NCAA with a positive program for changes in the Sanity Code. The Rector stated that he believed the officials of the University should consult with other institutions who feel that the NCAA regulations should be modified. Mr. Gravatt stated it was his impression that Captain Pritchett was opposed to our associating ourselves with any club seeking to amend the NCAA Code because he believes that the NCAA will split off into regional groups. Captain Pritchett feels that it would be better for us to wait until these regional groups are organized, and then to decide which group it would be to our best advantage to join. The Rector requested the Athletic Committee to consider the following questions and to make appropriate recommendations not later than the December meeting of the Board 1. What is our own policy going to be? 2. What are other universities doing? 3. How far can we go with them? 4. Who should represent the University at the January meeting of the NCAA? BUDGET REQUESTS FOR LAW SCHOOL 1950-52 The President again presented to the Board the request made in June 1949 by the Finance Committee of the Law School Alumni Association for additional funds to supplement faculty salaries, in the amount of $20,625 per year. The Board reiterated the stand taken upon this question in June, namely, that it could not at this time endorse the request for increases in faculty salaries but hoped that some provision could be made in the future. MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE MATTERS BOND ISSUES The following resolution was adopted RESOLVED, that Mary Washington College be and is hereby authorized under the terms of the Acts of 1946, Chapter 127, Page 183, to issue bonds not to exceed $1,000,000 to supplement funds that have been appropriated or may hereafter be appropriated by the General Assembly for Fine Arts Building, Student Activities Building, and Infrimary, and there shall be segregated and pledged from student fees the sum of $70 per student insofar as needed for the purpose of redeeming or liquidating such bonds INCREASE IN TUITION AND FEES The following resolution was adopted. RESOLVED, that Mary Washington College be and is hereby authorized to increase general college fees for all students from $140 to $170 and that the non-resident tuition fees for out of State students be increased from $220 to $280 for the session of nine months beginning with the session 1950-51. - - - On motion the meeting was then adjourned Barron F.

So much of the Consolidated Endowment Fund as is invested in mortgage loans is not, however, handled through the State-Planters Bank and Trust Company, but under an agreement with The Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville, acting as Custodian and service agent. A statement of the principal amounts of these mortgage loans and their maturity dates is attached hereto. It will be noted that eight of these sixteen mortgage secured loans have been made to Greek-letter fraternities having chapter houses at the University of Virginia. Pursuant to a resolution of the Board adopted at its meeting held June 1, 1946, the interest on all fraternity loans was reduced to 4 per cent as of January 1, 1942, and counsel for the University was requested to work out new contracts with each fraternity upon the basis of the balances arrived at by the application of a formula included in that resolution. Mr. Perkins has been working steadily upon this matter, and on July 6, 1949, advised your Committee that five of the eight loans had been refinanced in accordance with the wishes of the Board, and mortgage loan papers reflecting the results of his efforts are now in the hands of The Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville As of the date of Mr. Perkins' letter, a copy of which is attached hereto as information, new contracts had not been worked out with (1) Alpha Home Association of Chi Phi Fraternity, (2) Delta Kappa Epsilon Corporation, and (3) Omicron Chapter House Society of Phi Gamma Delta. Mr. Perkins advised your Committee on October 11th that he had just succeeded in completing the refinancing of Alpha Home Association of Chi Phi Fraternity, so that there now remain only two of these fraternity loans which have not been refinanced in the manner contemplated by the resolution of the Board of July 1, 1946. Mr. Perkins has had a great deal of difficulty in finding responsible representatives of these fraternities with whom to undertake negotiations, or to have them represented by independent counsel, since he of course cannot function in the matter except as counsel for the University. He has been pursuing the matter vigorously, however, and your Committee hopes to be able to report shortly that each of the eight loans now made to fraternities at the University are in current and proper form. Since this Committee was appointed by the present Rector on June 2, 1949, the following loans have been approved for the account of the Consolidated Endowment Fund (1) Charles W. Woltz, Assistant Dean of the Law School - $16,000.00. This Committee has agreed to refinance a construction loan which Mr. Woltz will arrange with some financial institution, to be secured by a mortgage upon the residence which he proposes to construct in Meadowbrook Heights, just off Dairy Road, the loan not to exceed 60 per cent of the appraised value of the property (building and grounds) after completion of the improvements, to run for a period of not more than 15 years, to bear interest at 4-1/2 per cent, if such curtails can be made monthly in an amount not to exceed 20 per cent of Mr. Woltz's fixed income after deducting fire insurance premiums, taxes and any other financial obligations he may have incurred requiring monthly or other curtails out of his income. (2) Delta Kappa Epsilon. This fraternity borrowed $6,000.00 in 1943 and the loan has now been reduced to $4,500.00. An increase in the loan in the amount of $3,000.00 has been approved by your Committee, making a total loan obligation of $7,500.00, provided curtails in the amount of $100.00 per month, with accrued interest, are made during each of the nine months of the college year. The fraternity house is insured for $25,000.00 and your Committee is informed is probably worth considerably in excess of that amount. The increase in the loan is to be used to make necessary repairs on the fraternity house. Your Committee reluctantly and regretfully declined the application of Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., a Professor at the University. Professor Berkeley requested a loan of $14,000.00 to complete the construction of a residence he had been building at 1927 Thomson Road, at an estimated cost of $20,375.00. Your Committee felt that Professor Berkeley's equity in the property was not sufficient and that his earning power and probable ability to amortize the loan over a reasonable period of time had not been sufficiently shown, to warrant the making of a loan to him in the amount requested. Respectfully submitted, (s) Frank Talbott, Jr. (s) Benj. W. Mears (s) Thomas B. Gay Chairman Finance Committee October 14, 1949</field>
