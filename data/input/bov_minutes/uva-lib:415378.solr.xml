      <field name="fulltext">July 14, 1945 A special meeting of the Board of Visitors was held on this date in the President's office at 11 o'clock, with the following present: The Rector, R. Gray Williams, Visitors Lewis C. Williams, Christopher B. Garnett, C. O'Conor Goolrick, Edward C. Anderson, Dabney S. Lancaster, Barron F. Black, Mrs. Phoebe E. Willis and Mrs. Bertha P. Wailes; President Newcomb, and President Combs of Mary Washington College. Minutes of the meeting of June 15, copied and mailed to the members were approved. The Rector announced to the meeting the death, on June 21, 1945, of James Howard Corbitt, a member of the Board of Visitors, and stated that he had requested Mr. Garnett to prepare and present to the meeting a Memorial in his honor. Thereupon, Mr. Carnett presented the following which was unanimously adopted: MEMORIAL TO JAMES HOWARD CORBITT JAMES HOWARD CORBITT of Suffolk, Virginia, died in Richmond, on June 21, 1945. He was born at Boykins, Southampton County, Virginia, April 29, 1869. His death removed the alumnus who was more closely identified and connected with the University than any other alumnus, if we exclude the members of the faculty of the University. After two years at Richmond College, he entered the University in 1888 and for ten years was a resident of the University, either as a student or as an instructor. He took his A.B. and B.Ph. degrees in 1892; his M.A. in 1893. He was instructor in natural philosophy from 1891 to 1897. Although his ability, training and experience entitled him to look forward to the professorship of natural philosophy, he determined to change his profession and become a student in the Law Department in 1897-98. In 1899 and 1900 he was a practicing attorney at Atlanta, Georgia, naving been previously admitted to the Virginia bar in 1898 and to the Georgia bar in 1899. Since 1900 he has practiced law at Suffolk, Virginia, where he was made Assistant Division Counsel of the Southern Railway, District Counsel for the Seaboard Airline Railway, Counsel for the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway and the Atlantic Coast Line and Virginia Railway Companies. His interest in law was not confined to practice and procedure and the winning of cases. This is evidenced by the fact that he was for many years an active member of the Virginia State Bar Association and its president in 1927-28; likewise a member of the American Bar Association, and a member of its Board of Governors in 1936-38. His interest in the University of Virginia is attested by every loyal alumnus, and many will recall the unstinted devotion which he showed by leading the fights in the Legislature for or against those bills which affected the University of Virginia. The refusal of the Legislature to make the University a co-ordinate college for women was in a large measure due to his activity and ceaseless work before the Legislature. Thus, indirectly, he had a great deal to do with the establishment of Mary Washington College at Fredericksburg as the recognized college of liberal arts for women in Virginia, supported by taxation. The fraternities and societies to which he belonged give evidence of the wonderful influence with, and interest in, other people, which was the marked characteristic of Jim Corbitt. He was a member of Alpha Tau Omega, Lambda Pi, Phi Delta Phi, Phi Beta Kappa and Tilka Society. He was a member of the Virginia Club at Norfolk, Princess Anne at Virginia Beach, Commonwealth Club at Richmond, the Colonnade at the University of Virginia, Farmington Country Club at Charlottesville, and of the University and Cosmos Clubs in Washington, D. C. On November 26, 1902, he married Roberta Clifford Ansley, and she bore him three daughters, Roberta (Mrs. Tomlin Braxton Horsley), Anne Middleton (Mrs. Lamar Wight Little), and Harriet Whitney. His home life was ideal and his devotion to his family was well known among all of his friends. He served the University of Virginia for many years as a member of the Alumni Board of Trustees and since 1934 he has been a member of the Board of Visitors. As in all other capacities, his service was unselfish and directed solely to the best interests of the University. Until incapacitated by his last illness, he rarely ever missed a meeting of the Board of Visitors or of the committees to which he belonged. He was a friend without guile, a foe without fear and always a gentleman. President Newcomb reported the following: ENROLLMENT: 1193. GIFTS: From the General Education Board, for the salary of a Plant Physiologist and for equipment and supplies for the Physiology Laboratory $29,500 From the Rockefeller Foundation, toward the expenses of the proposed trips of Dr. Rowland Egger 2,700 From the Estate of Miss Dorothy Deering 2,500 PROMOTIONS AND ELECTIONS: Upon the recommendation of the President, the following promotions and elections were voted, effective July 1, 1945, at the salaries stated for nine months' session, unless otherwise noted: PROMOTIONS: Dr. Duncan Clark Hyde, Associate Professor to Professor of Economics; salary of $4,500.
