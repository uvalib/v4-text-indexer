HERMITAGE FOUNDATION Mr. Darden stated that thus far the faculty had not been able to find a suitable man in sculpture. The applicants interviewed to date do not have the educational background which the President feels necessary. Mr. Darden stated that he did not feel the Board should make a commitment to Mrs. Sloane until the General Assembly approves an appropriation for the School of Fine Arts. Mr. Black moved that the President write to Mrs. Sloane, giving her a statement setting forth the recommendations, spread in the minutes of the November 1947 meeting, of the Special Committee appointed by the Dean of the College to propose a program of fine arts. It was the sense of the Board that the President should include this proposal in his next biennial budget requests to the Legislature. ASSIGNMENT OF LAWN AND RANGE ROOMS The President recommended that the rooms on the Lawn and Ranges should be awarded to students on the basis of scholarship and leadership. The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED that the regulations now in force requiring residents of Lawn and Range rooms to be Virginians be rescinded, and that the President be and he is hereby authorized to set up regulations for assignment of these rooms. CABELL HALL The President stated that he had discussed with Mr. Stern of the Art Commission the plans for the extension of Cabell Hall to provide classrooms for the College. Mr. Stern had informed the President that there was some sentiment in the Art Commission about the building of an addition to Cabell Hall which would "freeze" the present architectural layout of the Lawn. The Art Commission had hoped that Cabell Hall might someday be torn down and the Lawn restored to the original plan of Jefferson. Mr. Darden asked the Board for an expression of opinion on the above matter, stating that he felt very strongly that it was important to tie the College to the Lawn, and that this could be done only by joining the new Academic Building to Cabell Hall so that students would walk along the Lawn passing to and from classes. He stated that if the Academic Building were constructed out beyond the Engineering School, few of the three thousand students in the College would have any occasion to visit the Lawn, because they would go from the Academic Building to the dormitories and to the Library. He stated that he believed the Lawn was the heart of the University and that every effort should be made to anchor the College to this most beautiful academic village in the world. The Board unanimously endorsed the sentiments expressed by the President and stated that it was the sense of the Board that the present plans for the development of Cabell Hall as the academic center of the College would best serve the future interests of the University. COCKE HALL The Secretary called to the attention of the Board a resolution, adopted January 21, 1939, that the old Engineering Building, formerly called the Mechanical Laboratory, be designated The John Hartwell Cocke Hall. He pointed out that the lettering on the exterior of the building had never been changed, and the Board thereupon approved the lettering for the exterior of the building to read "COCKE HALL." DEVELOPMENT FUND The President stated that a long-term policy for the Development Fund should be worked out by July 1, 1949. The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED that the Special Committee on the Development Fund be requested to consider the matter of formulating a long-range program for the Development Fund and to make recommendations to the Board. MINUTES OF THE BOARD A request from Mr. Harry Taylor for permission to peruse the minutes of the Board was presented. It was moved that Mr. Taylor be advised that the Secretary of the Board will provide him with copies of resolutions on any subject he desires. INCREASE IN EXTENSION FEES A proposal by the Extension Division to increase fees for Home Study courses in accordance with the general increase in University fees which was effective for the 1949-50 session was approved, as set out in the following schedule.

To insure adequate filling of the dormitories, three students are placed in each room at the start of the year. Dormitory space is now needed for 700 students, as follows: 200 now living in city homes 200 now living in rented buildings 300 in limiting rooms to two occupants 700 This will greatly increase the cost of operation. Mrs. Wailes stated that the Mary Washington College Committee is making no recommendation at this time about dormitory construction, but hopes that the next Legislature will appropriate fifty per cent of the cost of a dormitory for 300. The enrollment of Virginia students is now about fifty per cent, and the number of Virginians is decreasing each year. President Combs stated that the last State appropriation for dormitories was in 1914, and that the students had largely paid for the buildings at Mary Washington College. LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR PRESIDENT COMBS The Board approved a leave of absence for President Combs to visit South America. HEAD OF SPANISH DEPARTMENT Dr. Clifton Breeke McIntosh, Associate Professor of Spanish and Portuguese at Mary Washington College, appeared before the Beard concerning the appointment of Professor Louis J. Cabrera as Chairman of the Spanish Department. Mr. Gay moved that the Rector appoint a sub-committee to investigate the questions raised by Dr. McIntosh, and report to the Board. The Committee so appointed consists of Mr. Black as Chairman, Mr. Mears, and Mr. Gay. *â*â* There being no further business to come before the meeting, the same was adjourned after a motion to that effect had been made, seconded, and carried.
