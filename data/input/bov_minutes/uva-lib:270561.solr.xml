Woods, Samuel H. Lewis, &amp; R. W. Hughes. Resolved that the office of commissioner of Accounts be revived and that the compensation be fixed by the Executive Committee. Resolved the Robert R. Prentis be appointed Commissioner of Accounts. The Rector laid before the Board a memorial signed by a number of persons who propose to open Boarding Houses for students outside the precincts of the University, praying for a removal of all restrictions upon the price charged for board, room rent &amp;c. Whereupon on motion Resolved that the memorial of the outside boarding house Keepers be referred to the Faculty for their decision, with the request that they will give to the whole subject a serious consideration. Resolved that the regulation fixing a charge of $5 on each boarder at the Hotels be rescinded. Resolved that the rent of the two large Hotels (E&amp;F) be fixed at four hundred dollars, each, per annum and that of the small one (A) at two hundred dollars per annum. Resolved that the Proctor's application for an appro- priation of $350 to repair his house be granted. The Rector laid before the Board a communication from Robert S. Jones upon the subject of establishing within the University a Laundry &amp; Baths. On motion Resolved that the same be referred to the Chairman and also that the petition of Charles E. Bailey for the like purpose, referred at the last meeting to the Executive Committee, take the same direction. Resolved that B. J. Barbour, Ro. W. Hughes, &amp; Samuel Watts be requested to memorialize the legislature for suitable assistance to inaugurate the Statue of Jefferson at the University, and that the Rector in his reports, be requested to specially invite the attention of the Governor to the subject. Resolved that an Assistant Professor be apointed in the School of Mathematics with the special view of aiding the Professor of Mathematics in the Department of Drawing and Field Practice in the new School of Engineering, and also in such other duties in connexion with the School of Pure Mathematics as may be assigned him. Said Assistant to be paid one thousand dollars from the excees of the fees in the School of Mathematics [as may be] over two thousand dollars, and in addition to receive a fee of $25 from each student whom he may instruct in the special department of Engineering. And it is farther ordered that for the whole Engineering course there shall be paid the sum of $70- viz the above fee of $25 to the Assistant Professor and $15 each to the Professors of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, &amp; Chemistry- provided that it shall be optional with the students to take one or more of the classes in Engineering. On motion - The Board adjourned to meet at 11 oclock Monday morning September 10th. Wm. Wertenbaker, Secretary Monday September 10th 1866 The Board met pursuant to adjournment. Present the same members as on Saturday. Resolved that from the unexpended balance of the annuity fund the Proctor or Chairman be instructed to effect insurance immediately upon the University buildings and that the remainder of the fund be turned over to the Proctor to meet the immediate expenses of the University. Whereas the establishment of an observatory and Chair of Practical Astronomy is one of the measures necessary to placing this institution abreast of the other scientific institutions in this country, and it is deemed eminently expedient that the name and attainments of Capt. Mathew F. Maury shall be associated with the University which is at present unable to carry out successfully the enterprise, from its own resources, and it is hoped that through the influence &amp; reputation of Captain Maury the necessary means may be obtained for the accomplishment of so desirable an object, therefore be it Resolved that the Rector of the Board communicate with Captain M. F. Maury on the subject of the establishment of an Observatory in the University, with the special view of ascertaining whether in his opinion the requisite funds for building and equipping an observatory and creating a permanent fund for an observer might not be obtained by subscriptions at home and abroad, and whether he would not take charge of the work and give his labors and the influence of his name for the foundation of said observatory- and accept the position of Director of Observatory and Professor of Practical Astronomy in the University. Resolved that the arrangements for the Inauguration of the Statue of Jefferson be referred to the Executive Committee, with authority, after epistolary consultation with the members of the Board, to appoint an Orator. Whereas the subjects of Rhetorick &amp; Belles Lettres have been dropped from some unexplained reason from the course of studies at the University, be it resolved that Professors Holmes and McGuffy be requested to have a conference on the subject and arrange for the reinstatement of these studies in the course. Resolved, unanimously, that William E. Peters be appointed Professor of Latin. On motion the Board then adjourned. Wm. Wertenbaker Secretary B. J. Barbour Rector of Univ. of Va.</field>
