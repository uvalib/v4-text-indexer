      <field name="fulltext">APPROVAL OF POLICIES RELATING TO THE SOLICITATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF GIFTS AND BEQUESTS The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following policy statement relating to the solicitation and acceptance of gifts and bequests by the University be and it is hereby approved: The University is composed of the College of Arts and Sciences and the Schools of Architecture, Commerce, Education, Engineering and Applied Science, Graduate Arts and Sciences, Graduate Business, Law, Medicine, and Nursing. Private contributions to the University of Virginia may be for the general purposes of the University as a whole or for the specific use of the College, for one of the Schools, for an individual department, for a particular facility, program, area of study, or organization. The donor may direct that a contribution be expended in full during one or more years for current operating expenses or purchases, or it may be used to establish a special endowment fund or be added to general endowment funds. The uses of the funds may be specified for purposes such as professorships, scholarships, books, teaching, research, etc. almost without limit. Gifts for either the current use or the endowment purposes of the University should be made payable to "The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia" and shall be received and expended or invested by the Rector and Visitors under its authority. Gifts for current or capital purposes may also be accepted by University-related foundations. Any proposals or plans for major fund raising from private sources should be discussed with the Vice President for Development before being undertaken. Any school, department, University-related foundation or other organization which seeks to initiate a new annual giving program or to conduct one or more special solicitations with a goal of $10,000 or more, therefore, must first consult with the Vice President for Development. Those which are conducting established annual giving programs need not clear these regular solicitations with the Development Office. When a gift to the University is received, it must be reported promptly to the Treasurer for deposit to the proper account using the University's Deposit/Receipt Form. Copies of all Deposit/Receipt Forms relating to gifts to the University will be sent to the Development Office by the Treasurer's Office. All gifts to the University transmitted to members of either the Faculty or the Administration must be acknowledged to the donor by the appropriate Dean, Department Head or Administrative Officer. For gifts to the University in excess of $250, a copy of both the letter of transmittal from the donor and the acknowledgement to the donor must also be forwarded to the Development Office. The President will send acknowledgement letters to those donors making gifts to the University, or to any University-related foundation, which are of an appropriate size for such acknowledgement. Each University-related foundation, therefore, will consult with the Vice President for Development in order to establish an appropriate minimum size of gift for the President's acknowledgement to their donors. A. General Policies Pertaining to Restrictions in Uses of Gifts 1. General Restrictions Restrictions based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, or national origin are unacceptable in any gift to the University and should be unacceptable in any gift to a University-related foundation. 2. Restrictions Involving Student Financial Aid The following restrictions are unacceptable in gifts to the University for scholarships, fellowships, or other financial aid funds and should be unacceptable in contributions to a University-related foundation for such purposes: (a) Restrictions permitting designation of an individual recipient by the donor; (b) Restrictions to relatives or descendants as recipients; (c) Restrictions upon the future employment of the recipient; (d) Restrictions by the donor on interest rates and conditions for repayment of loans. (Rates of interest or repayment requirements should be determined by University policy and practice at the time of the loan.) B. General Policies Pertaining to Solicitation and Acceptance of Certain Types of Gifts 1. Gifts of Tangible Property An offer of a gift of tangible property may be accepted initially and conditionally on behalf of the President and the Rector and Visitors by deans, directors of libraries and museums, and other authorized officers. The receipt and acceptance of such tangible gifts with estimated value of $250 or more shall be reported to the Vice President for Development for confirmation and formal acceptance by the Rector and Visitors. Gifts of tangible personal property such as paintings or other works of art or furniture, or collections as such, should not be accepted if made on the condition or expectation that the items will be permanently exhibited, or that the collections will be maintained and shown as such. Any gift offered with such a restriction or condition shall be reported to the Vice President for Development and may be accepted only by vote of the Board of Visitors. The following are unacceptable restrictions or considerations in connection with gifts-in-kind: (a) The acceptance of such gifts shall not involve significant additional expense for their present or future use, display, maintenance or administration. (b) No financial or other burdensome obligation or expense is or will be directly or indirectly incurred by the University as a result thereof. (c) University officers or faculty members should not furnish valuations or appraisals to donors in connection with gifts-in-kind to the University of Virginia. (d) Gifts of tangible personal property (such as books and paintings) will not be accepted if made on the condition, or understanding, or expectation that the items will be loaned back to the donor or persons designated by the donor for life or extended periods of time to be determined by the donor. 2. Gifts of Real Property (a) An offer of a gift of real estate shall be reported to the Vice President for Development and may be accepted only by vote of the Board of Visitors. (b) No financial or other burdensome obligation or expense shall be incurred directly or indirectly by the University as a result of a gift of real property, particularly where the donor wishes to retain a life estate for himself and others in the property. Expenses for maintenance and real estate taxes shall be borne by the donor where a life estate is retained in such property. (c) Restrictions as to the ultimate sale of real property received as a gift will not be accepted by the University. Where final sale is not restricted, designating a purpose within the University for a fund created by the assets received from a sale of such property, is permissible. 3. Gifts of Securities The handling of gifts of securities often has very specific tax consequences to the donor. All gifts of securities to the University must be handled by the Treasurer's Office. The Treasurer of the University will then notify the Office of University Development of all such gifts. C. General Policies Pertaining to the Establishment of Funds for Certain Purposes It is the policy of the Rector and Visitors to approve the establishment of funds for certain purposes upon the receipt of gifts or commitments which meet the prescribed requirements. Only the most popular types of funds and their funding requirements are described below. There are many other purposes for funds which offer a variety of gift opportunities. Each school or department may suggest special activities, programs, research, lectures, etc. which can be supported by varying amounts of funding. Gifts for endowment are usually pooled for investment with the University's general endowment funds and the individual funds are credited with their pro rate share of the earnings at the annual rate as determined by the Finance Committee of the Board of Visitors. A new endowment fund may be established by the University with a principal amount of not less than $5,000. An endowment fund may be established, however, even though the principal amount may not have reached the required minimum, if the donor will undertake a binding obligation to supplement the income of the fund with annual gifts sufficient to provide a total income which is equal to at least 5 percent of the principal required for the establishment of the endowment fund. The donor must also agree to complete the endowment within a reasonable period of time. 1. Professorships A named endowed professorship may be established to supplement the available State support for an existing professorship in a school or a field of study. Such an endowment fund may be established with gifts to total $100,000 where such a fund is submitted for matching under the Eminent Scholars program or under an equivalent matching program. Gifts should total $200,000 if terms of the gift fail to qualify for matching or if matching funds are not available. 2. Lectureships A named endowment fund to provide a lecture program (i.e., one which may be used for the honorarium and expenses of a special guest lecturer) may be established with a fund of not less than $10,000 3. Scholarships A named endowed scholarship may be established with a fund of not less than $25,000 or a guarantee of annual support for one or more recipients totaling at least $1,200 but with no award being made which is less than $300 to a recipient. 4. Fellowships A named endowed fellowship may be established with a fund of not less than $100,000 or a guarantee of annual support for one or more recipients totaling at least $5,000 but with no award being made which is less than $1,000 to a recipient. 5. Prize Funds A named financial award for outstanding accomplishment may be provided through the establishment of a prize fund with an endowment of not less than $5,000 to furnish awards of approximately $200 or more to one or more students each year. 6. Book Funds The earnings from an endowed book fund may be used for the purchase of books or other materials in a particular field or library and also may be used as specified by the donor for other expenses of the library. Such a fund may be established with not less than $5,000. 7. Funds for Student Activities Gifts and funds will be accepted for the support of recognized student activities only if such activities have the approval of the Vice President for Student Affairs. 8. Funds for Buildings and Grounds Whenever a donor, in making a gift to the University for a building, wishes to have the building named for one whom he designates, it is the policy of the Rector and Visitors to require that at least fifty-one percent of the announced cost of the building be given by the donor. When gift opportunities are offered for parts of a building or for landscape features, a donor may name such designated portions of buildings and grounds by contributing the entire announced cost. There may be exceptions to this policy but in no case shall any agreement or understanding in this regard be reached without the Rector and Visitors first being advised. D. General Policies Pertaining to Bequests Any bequest to the University of Virginia should be made to "The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a Virginia public corporation, located at Charlottesville." This is the legal name of the corporate body. 1. Unrestricted Bequests An unrestricted bequest is of special value because of the freedom to use it wherever and however needed. An unrestricted bequest intended for the general purposes of the University, one which the Rector and Visitors are free to use to establish an endowment fund or to expend in whole or in part as they deem best, might read simply: "I hereby devise and bequeath to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a Virginia public corporation, located at Charlottesville (the sum of $. . . .) (all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate) (. . . . percent of my residuary estate)." Depending upon the size of such a bequest it will, under present practices of the Rector and Visitors, be added to a general endowment fund if it is relatively small, or used to establish an endowment fund in the name of the testator or in whatever other name he or she may direct. If the bequest meets the stated minimum dollar requirements and the testator wishes to assure that the principal will be used to establish an endowment fund and remain as such permanently and not be expended, the will might read as follows: "I hereby devise and bequeath to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a Virginia public corporation, located at Charlottesville (the sum of $. . . .) (all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate) (. . . . percent of my residuary estate) to establish the . . . . Fund, the earnings only to be used for the general purposes of the University as the Rector and Visitors may determine." 2. Restricted Bequests Many donors understandably have special interests which they may desire to promote or support. Bequests for these restricted purposes may be expressed as follows: "I hereby devise and bequeath to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a Virginia public corporation, located at Charlottesville (the sum of $. . . .) (all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate) (. . . . percent of my residuary estate) for the benefit of the (College) (School) to be used for (the library) (for publications) (for research) (for scholarships)." If the endowment fund is for a limited or restrictive purpose, it is advisable to provide an "escape" clause. Those who administer the University's affairs in the future should be left free to make use of the funds in the best interests of the University and the public under changed conditions. This can be accomplished by the statement: "If, in the opinion of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, all or part of the earnings of this fund cannot be usefully applied to the above purpose (or in the above manner), they may use the same for any purpose within the general corporate powers of the University" or, if it is desired to restrict the gift to a particular School or Department, ". . . . for any other purpose related to the College or School which in its opinion will most nearly accomplish my wishes and purposes." It is recommended that specified purposes be described as broadly as possible, and that detailed limitations and restrictions be avoided. The Vice President for Development must be consulted before a detailed plan for a specified purpose is approved. 3. Suggested Language for Specific Purposes (a) Professorships To establish a professorship at the University of Virginia, either by an inter vivos gift or through a bequest, the following statement is suggested: "I hereby (give), (devise and bequeath) to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a Virginia public corporation, located at Charlottesville (the sum of $ . . . .) (all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate) (. . . . percent of my residuary estate) to establish the . . . . Fund. This Fund shall be added to the University's Eminent Scholars Endowment Fund and the income therefrom shall be used to attract and retain eminent scholars in the field of . . . . . at the University through the establishment of the . . . . Professorship in the (College, School) of . . . . . Such income is to be matched by State appropriation when and if such funds are provided by the Commonwealth of Virginia for such purposes. (b) Scholarships or Fellowships The following form will create by bequest a scholarship or fellowship fund which will be efficient to administer: "I hereby devise and bequeath to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a Virginia public corporation located at Charlottesville (the sum of $ . . . .) (all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate) (. . . . percent of my residuary estate) to establish the . . . . Fund, the earnings only from which shall be used for (scholarship) (fellowship) to students in the University of Virginia (College of Arts and Sciences) or (other school within the University). Awards from this fund are to be designated (. . . . Scholarships) (. . . . Fellowships). The earnings of this fund may be used each year, or if not so used, may be used in a subsequent year or years, or added to the principal of the fund as the Rector and Visitors may determine." Funds endowed for these purposes should be established with the provision of the "escape" clause suggested above so as to permit the use of the funds in a manner which will most nearly accomplish the wishes of the donor. (c) Teaching, Research or Lectureships Funds may be given for teaching, for research or for lectureships in specific areas. While it may be desired to refer to the academic area of the teaching or lectureship, or to the subject matter or field of research, provision should be made to permit discretionary use in a different academic area, subject or field: "I hereby devise and bequeath to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a Virginia public corporation, located at Charlottesville (the sum of $. . . .) (all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate) (. . . . of my residuary estate) to establish the . . . . (Fellowship) (Research Fund) (Lectureship). The earnings only from the fund may be used for the stipend and support of (a teaching fellow) (a research fellow) (for a research program in . . . .) (for the support of a member of the teaching staff with the rank of lecturer or a visiting professor in . . . .)." Funds endowed for these purposes should be established with the provision of the "escape" clause suggested above so as to permit the use of the funds in a manner which will most nearly accomplish the wishes of the donor. (d) Book Funds "I hereby devise and bequeath to The Rector and Visitors of the University, a Virginia public corporation, located at Charlottesville (the sum of . . . .) (all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate) (. . . . percent of my residuary estate) to establish the . . . . Fund. The earnings only may be used to the purchase of books or other materials (in the field of . . . .) and for other purposes of the (University of Virginia Library) (the Law School Library, etc.)." If the fund is restricted to a particular field it would be desirable to permit alternative use in other fields at the discretion of the Librarian. E. General Policies Pertaining to Deferred and Other Estate-Related Gifts The terms and conditions of gifts to create charitable remainder unitrusts, charitable remainder annuity trusts, charitable income ("lead") trusts, or charitable gift annuities, and the terms and conditions of gifts which are acceptable for a pooled income fund trust shall be submitted by the Vice President for Development to the Vice President for Business and Finance before the acceptance of such gifts by the University. A pooled income fund gift or a charitable gift annuity provides the means whereby a donor, who cannot afford to make a large enough gift for a separately invested trust, can support the University and receive the benefits offered by a life income gift. The Finance Committee of the Board of Visitors has authorized the establishment of the University of Virginia Pooled Income Fund. A gift to this Fund will be commingled with the gifts of others as in a mutual fund, and will be managed by a Trustee. The gift may be unrestricted or designated for a purpose specified by the donor. The income from a gift to the Pooled Income Fund will be paid quarterly to the first beneficiary, and may also be paid to a second beneficiary, for his or her lifetime. At the termination of the life income contract the share of the trust fund attributable to the donor's contribution is transferred to the University or to a University-related foundation.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">REPORT FROM THE EDUCATIONAL POLICY COMMITTEE ON THE STATE COUNCIL OF HIGHER EDUCATION REPORT ON FACULTY TENURE AND ACTIVITY On behalf of Mr. C. Waller Barrett, Chairman of the Educational Policy Committee, who was unavoidably absent, the President distributed a report of the Educational Policy Committee which was prepared as directed by the Board in its resolution of April 2, 1977. The resolution directed the Educational Policy Committee to review the recommendations of the State Council of Higher Education in its report "Faculty Tenure and Activity in Virginia" and to report back to the Board at the October 1977 meeting. The report is as follows: REPORT OF THE EDUCATIONAL POLICY COMMITTEE ON THE STATE COUNCIL OF HIGHER EDUCATION FOR VIRGINIA REPORT ON FACULTY TENURE AND ACTIVITY The Educational Policy Committee has carefully reviewed the Faculty Tenure and Activity report. A preliminary study of the report was undertaken at the Educational Policy Committee's October 13, 1976 meeting and on September 14, 1977 the Committee held a special meeting for the purpose of reviewing the report. The report urged boards of visitors to ensure that careful planning and management of personnel systems are given high priority by institutional administrators and that the boards and administrators should at all times be alert to faculty staffing plans. At the University of Virginia the administration reviews the faculty staffing plan annually in conjunction with the preparation of the budget for each succeeding year. For the past several years, the Provost has reported annually to the Board of Visitors on the tenured percentage for each individual school at the University. Committee and Board minutes show seven reports by the Provost on faculty staffing and on policies and procedures related thereto since May of 1974. A large portion of the docket of each Board meeting is taken up by faculty personnel matters. There is little doubt that these matters receive a high priority by the Board. Further recommendations were then discussed: To assist boards of visitors in this regard (i.e., the problem of increasing tenure percentage), Council's report identifies some possible modifications of tenure systems. Boards of visitors were urged to consider these. First, as reported at the June, 1977 meeting, the tenure percentage at the University is at a comfortably low level of 60 percent. However, recognizing the implications of the steady state enrollment projected beyond 1980, President Shannon in 1973, following Provost Shannon's recommendation, appointed a special faculty committee, under the chairmanship of Professor William L. Duren, to study the issue and report to him. This report, which was received after Mr. Hereford had taken office, analyzed the problem, concluded that the current tenure percentage was satisfactory, and proposed a lowering of the mandatory retirement age to sixty-five to insure an effective turnover of faculty in the future. With this in mind, the following comments were considered in response to the specific suggestions contained in the main text of the State Council of Higher Education report (they are cited by reference in its Conclusions and Suggestions). (a) Increase the number of non-tenurable positions. This we have done by election of certain staff to faculty positions in the General Faculty with a clear statement and understanding that they are then not on a tenure track. The Board has considered this several times. (b) Hire more part-time faculty. Since our tenured percentage is not too high, we have limited part-time faculty to situations in which we are particularly anxious to have the individual involved because of his unusual qualifications. (c) Increase the turnover of faculty. As reported to the Board several times over the past few years, there has been steady decrease in the percentage of faculty members who are promoted to tenure rank upon reaching the end of their probationary period. Only about one-third are so promoted; the remainder seek positions elsewhere. (d) Increase the length of the probationary period. This would be in violation of the AAUP 1940 Statement of Principles of Academic Freedom and Tenure. Although the Board has never taken action to adopt that statement as policy, President Shannon, during the 1960's, stated formally that University practices would conform to these principles. Under the AAUP principles, unless twelve months or more before the end of his seventh year a full-time teaching faculty member is informed that he will not be promoted to tenure rank, the institution must retain him with tenure. We believe this principle is sound; further, nearly all the best colleges and universities in the nation have the same policy and to deviate from this policy would put us at a disadvantage in faculty recruiting at all levels. It makes it absolutely necessary to make a decision about the faculty member within his first six years (we normally make it within five). (e) Discontinue programs. We have done this in some instances, for example in geology and geography. We also have discontinued the undergraduate major in Italian and doctoral programs in music education and applied mechanics. (f) Various alternatives to the tenure system. The Committee is persuaded that the tenure system is sound and workable. It leads faculty members, chairmen, and deans to evaluate young faculty members carefully and to make recommendations regarding their retention with both their department's and the University's best interests in mind. (g) Make a larger proportion of new appointments at the untenured level. We are doing this, reserving the election of new faculty at tenure rank for a relatively small number of truly distinguished people. The Appointments Committee in the Center for Advanced Studies and a special committee of the College's best faculty members, appointed by Dean Floyd, make detailed reviews of all people considered for election with tenure (in Arts and Sciences). (h) Lower the mandatory retirement age. This was accomplished by Board of Visitors' action in 1976. For all faculty members elected to become effective on or after July 1, 1977, mandatory retirement age is sixty-five, rather than seventy. It is suggested that all institutions ensure that policies and procedures governing faculty personnel decisions are developed by faculties, administrators, and boards of visitors, and have these policies and procedures published. Final authority for these policies and procedures rests with the boards of visitors. The Educational Policy Committee has reviewed a document prepared by the Vice President and Provost called "Appointment, Reappointment, and Appointment Without Term", and has reviewed more detailed statements of procedures followed in each of the schools. This included sample records, letters of recommendations and other kinds of information normally considered for each faculty member when promotion to tenure is contemplated. The Committee gave special consideration to the seven suggestions listed on pages 160 and 161 of the State Council of Higher Education report. Lists of procedures have been sent to each member of the Board, and they are presently incorporated into institutional policies. These are available to faculty members. The Committee discussed procedures for dismissal actions during a term of appointment. These are a part of the AAUP 1940 statement which the administration has followed. As far as the University at Charlottesville is concerned, there has been no occasion for such a dismissal during the past 20 years, but there was such occasion at the Eastern Shore Branch before it was separated from the University and became part of the Community College System. Internal provision for "due process" includes possible appeal to the Faculty Senate's Committee on Faculty Relations. These provisions were sanctioned by the Board of Visitors in 1972 and again after amendment in 1973. At the University, faculty members are regularly notified of the review process. The Board of Visitors notifies faculty members of reappointment decisions by letter. Final authority for tenure decisions rests with the Board of Visitors with detailed administration of the tenure system delegated to the University. With respect to the privileges and responsibilities of tenure, the Committee and the President expressed reluctance to issue any formal statement about these to faculty members. Since the University is so very selective in determining which faculty members will be tenured, it follows that only very responsible persons are likely to receive tenured appointments. The President observed that the need to advise faculty members of improper actions has arisen in remarkably few cases. He said that about once or twice a year it has been necessary for the President to advise against the use of official University stationery in expressing personal opinion about controversial issues, but generally tenured faculty members here are very responsible. The Committee observed that all faculty members, whether tenured or not, are evaluated annually in the preparation of departmental annual reports, and that these evaluations are used in making salary determinations each year. Policies and procedures dealing with academic due process are carefully and regularly reviewed with the advice of the legal adviser who represents the Attorney General of the Commonwealth. In the preface of the State Council of Higher Education report, the opinion was expressed that boards of visitors should meet more frequently. The University of Virginia Board of Visitors has examined this question carefully. It has been determined that four meetings, each extending over two days, are more effective than eight one-day meetings. In addition to the four regular Board meetings, there are two Finance Committee meetings each odd year and one each even year for consideration of our annual operating budgets and biennial budget requests. Also, the Buildings and Grounds Committee holds an extra meeting about once a year, when the need for approval of plans for a capital outlay project cannot be delayed until the next regular meeting. On an ad hoc basis special committees have met just about every year on such matters as communication between the Board and the student body and revision of the Manual. In addition, nearly all members of the Board attend special events at the University. These include alumni events, convocations, graduating exercises, the student-faculty-administrator retreat and others. The time devoted to University affairs by members of the Board is already extensive and it is believed to be adequate. The Committee concluded its review of the report by noting that at the present time the procedures are effective and adequate, but is recognizes that in the future, changes will be needed, and that there will be a continuing review of its policies and procedures relating to tenure and faculty staffing. The Committee recommends the continuation of policies making tenure and associated matters a primary consideration for the Board of Visitors. Annually at the June meeting the practice of having a report to the Educational Policy Committee on tenure percentages by schools should be continued. Also, at this meeting any changes in policies related to elections, reelections, elections without term and similar matters should be brought to the Board. Copies of the current statements of these policies will be available to any member of the Board who might request them.</field>
