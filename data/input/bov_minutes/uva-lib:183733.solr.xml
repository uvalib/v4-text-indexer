      <field name="fulltext">RECOMMENDATION FOR GROUP TO CONSIDER MINORITY ENROLLMENT The following statement was approved: Several developments in recent months have heightened the Board's concern about the status of minority students at the University. While the goals set by the Virginia Plan for graduate and professional minority students have been met and exceeded, the same is not true for undergraduates, and especially for first time black Virginians. Withdrawal rates tend to be higher for minority undergraduates than for others, even though many minority students excel in a broad range of academic programs. We are especially concerned that the University's properly rigorous academic standards not impact unduly or unfairly upon those minority students whom we should and must seek to recruit and retain. These concerns have caused us to ask the President of the University to create at once a small internal working group to assess the current programs available for the academic support of minority and disadvantaged undergraduate students. Such a group would complement the work of the recently appointed Task Force on Afro-American Affairs, which will devote much of the coming academic year (and perhaps longer) to assessment of many related issues. The working group would gather and report to the Board, among other data: (1) Trends in the recruitment and retention of minority students over the past decade, with special information about differences (where they exist) between Virginians and out of state students, and an analysis of the long-range value to the University of a strong recruitment and retention program for in-state minority students; (2) Special efforts that have been and are being made (by the Admissions Office and other arms of the University) to recruit minority students; (3) Special academic support programs currently in place or planned for early implementation, and other positive steps that might be taken by the University to enhance the academic and extracurricular experience of minority students; and (4) Special concerns and needs of minority and disadvantaged students to which special attention should be given by all University offices that work with undergraduate students. A report from this working group is expected as soon as possible ideally by early November.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ATTACHMENT 2 FINAL REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S AD HOC COMMITTEE ON THE USE OF THE ROTUNDA August 28, 1986 USE OF THE ROTUNDA While it is very important to regard the Rotunda as an active, working building rather than a "sterile shrine", the building's special characteristics and historical significance dictate that its usage be carefully considered. There is heavy demand by University groups for the Rotunda facilities. The demand far outstrips the availability of space in the building. Several thousand visitors come to see the Rotunda in a typical month. Admissions officials arrange for prospective students to make their first official contact with the University in the Rotunda. Because of the irreplaceable, and fragile nature of the Rotunda interior, it must be used in ways that will not shorten the useful life of the structure. A set of guidelines and regulations have been in effect since the restoration in 1976. The following updates these, and are recommended as guidelines and regulations for use of the Rotunda to become effective immediately: ESTABLISHMENT OF A ROTUNDA USAGE STANDING COMMITTEE It is recommended that a small committee (say 3) be appointed by the President to assist the Rotunda Administrator in making decisions about requests for Rotunda facilities that are other than routine, and also to hear appeals from decisions made by the Rotunda Administrator. The Committee should have student and faculty representation. PROCEDURE FOR RESERVING SPACE IN THE ROTUNDA Reservations may be made by contacting the Rotunda Administrator. Reservations will be made in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this document, and in accordance with University regulations. GENERAL PRINCIPLES REGARDING USE Rotunda facilities may be reserved for dignified occasions, within the guidelines, by University departments, groups primarily controlled by faculty, staff, or the Alumni Association, Student Council recognized student groups, or University contracted independent organizations. Assignment of spaces shall be Content Neutral. Because of the heavy demand, it will be the responsibility of the Rotunda Administrator to make the facilities available to as many requestors as possible, avoiding overuse by any group. The Rotunda will not be used for private parties (e.g. wedding receptions) nor will it be used for events requiring the collection of admission fees at the Rotunda. THE DOME ROOM The Dome Room is the most fragile of the Rotunda facilities. Of special concern is the heart pine floor, which is fragile and irreplaceable. Special care must be taken in the use of this room. Such affairs as seated dinner, lectures, and musical events would be appropriate uses; however, cocktail parties and dances are not permitted. Refreshments may be served only at seated meals. Smoking is allowed only at seated functions. USE OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH PORTICOS Events that do not conflict with inside users may be held on North or South Porticos of the Rotunda provided that they are dignified occasions and are in compliance with Lawn Use regulations. Alcoholic beverages may not be served on the Porticos while the University is in session. Reservations may be made by the Rotunda Administrator. SECURITY PROVISIONS The Dome Room and other Rotunda facilities may be used after the normal closing hour for the Rotunda (4:45 p.m.) only if official Rotunda personnel are present. Users will be billed for the cost of these employees on an hourly basis. A modest use fee will also be assessed. Except at a seated function, smoking will not be permitted in the Dome Room. Candles, except for those placed on tables, will not be permitted. Because of very limited fire escape routes, there is an absolute limit on the capacity of the Dome Room which was set by the University Safety Officer. For banquet use the maximum capacity is 136 persons. For receptions, lectures and similar functions the maximum capacity is 150 persons. CATERING University Catering Service must provide and serve food and beverages and beverages for Rotunda events. SPECIAL EQUIPMENT AND FURNISHINGS REQUIREMENTS Furnishing, tables, chairs, and heavy equipment will be moved only by qualified University employees trained to do this without hazard to floors, walls, stairs, and other furnishings. Heavy equipment such as pianos (except for light weight electronic models and harpsichords) are not to be taken to the Dome Room. RESPONSIBILITY OF USERS Users will be required to agree in advance to pay for damage done to the Rotunda as a consequence of their event. Users will also be responsible to avoid disturbing other users who may be assigned to other rooms in the Rotunda. VISITORS AND SIGHTSEERS During the time the Rotunda is open to the public (usually 9:00 a.m. to 4:45 p.m.) Dome Room events will not normally be closed to the public. The oval rooms, if reserved, may be used for meetings to which the public is not invited. The public is not invited into the Rotunda after the normal closing hours. STUDENTS WISHING TO STUDY IN THE ROTUNDA Students are encouraged to use the alcoves in the Dome Room for study whenever the room is available during normal open hours, subject to normal regulation by the Rotunda Administrator. LUNCHEONS Except for official University-wide functions, the Dome Room will not be used for luncheons. Luncheons may be scheduled in the Lower West Oval Room. FREQUENCY OF USE (DOME ROOM) The Dome Room may be used for dinners no more than three times each week, and on annual average no more often than ten times each month. ELEVATOR Handicapped, infirm, or aged persons will be taken on the elevator to the upper floors by Rotunda personnel upon request. Others should use the stairways. In case of fire, the elevator will not be useable. ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL The columns, curved woodwork, and some of the antique furnishings require rigid humidity control. Even brief deviations from the specified humidity levels cause cracking and in some cases rapid deterioration. The Rotunda is equipped with an elaborate system for maintaining optimum temperature and humidity levels in all seasons. The system requires that all windows be kept tightly closed, and that all doors except the lower level entrance doors be kept closed. The glass doors overlooking the South portico should also be kept closed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ATTACHMENT 3 FINAL REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S AD HOC COMMITTEE ON THE USE OF THE LAWN September 24, 1986 This report addresses the uses of that part of the University of Virginia Historic District which includes the entire area between McCormick Road and Hospital Drive (on the West and East, respectively) and University Avenue and the Boundary formed by Pavilions IX and X, Rouss Hall, Old Cabell, and Cocke Hall (on the North and South, respectively). Excluded, for example, is the Amphitheatre. The Lawn is the geographical and spiritual heart of the University. The entire University Community -- students, faculty, administrators -- are its trustees, as well as the beneficiaries of this beauty and usefulness. To us who are here now have been given both all the benefits that we currently enjoy from the Lawn and also the obligation to preserve those benefits for future generations. We emphasize that the Lawn has extremely diverse uses and characteristics, among which are the following: 1. It is a national and international historic treasure. 2. It is a center of highly varied day-to-day academic activities. 3. It is used occasionally as a setting for University activities, such as official convocations. 4. It is a residential precinct for students and faculty. 5. It is an area for limited active and passive outdoor recreational activities. 6. It is a site for a steady stream of visitors and tourists from all over the world. The University Community has developed a proud tradition of mutual accommodations of all these diverse uses. The Lawn must perforce be open and accessible under reasonable rules and regulations (many of which are and have long been in place, administered, a.o., by the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, the Rotunda Administration, et. al.). The Lawn is replete with fragile, delicate structures and landscape content. Preservation is a constant concern and a burgeoning curatorial responsibility. That responsibility has been entrusted to the University as part of its fiduciary obligations to future generations. The danger that misuse of the Lawn presents to the historic edifices, and to their dependencies and surroundings, are real, not theoretical. Differing rules and regulations may apply to different parts of the Lawn -- e.g., the lower terrace may be governed by different safety precautions and regulations from those that apply to the upper three terrace. Moreover, space limitations and the plethora of requests for facilities perforce dictate orderly administrative rules, always provided that these rules will be content neutral. Pursuant to the foregoing reflections and considerations, your committee therefore resolves: A. That the gardens of the Pavilions are public areas. Those garden areas adjacent to the Pavilions are not required to be open to the public at all times. They are to be open when not in personal use, and they must be open on certain occasions, e.g., Garden Week. To temporarily close these adjacent gardens for personal use by the Pavilion residents, an appropriate sign may be placed upon the gates notifying the public. Where a garden is divided into two portions by an intervening wall, the remote section shall be open to the public at all times. The use of the gardens for social gatherings of University organizations is to be permitted where consistent with the occupancy of the Pavilion as home by the resident. B. That for the upper terraces of the Lawn (those between the Rotunda and the crosswalk at the northern limit of the "Homer Terrace" at the South) no structure or extended presence shall be permitted on the Lawn except for those needed in connection with official University functions. The same rule shall be in effect for the lower ("Homer") terrace, except that for that area of the lawn officially recognized student groups, academic or administrative departments, or University-related organizations or foundations may be granted use by the Office of the Dean of Students. That office will consider use in accordance with dictates affecting time, place, and manner. Among these are the following: 1. The use of the designated space ("Homer Terrace") by any one group at any time shall not exceed three consecutive days. 2. Disruption or obstruction of teaching, research, administration, disciplinary procedure, or other University activities, or of other authorized activities on University property is forbidden. (See Chapter 6, "Regulations", A: "Standards of Conduct," Item 4, p.78 of The 1986-87 Colonnades, the "Student Handbook.")</field>
