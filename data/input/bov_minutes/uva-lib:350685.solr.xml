Hawkins, Jr. Mr. Hiden, speaking for the Tavern Club, outlined the type of club which the students desire to build, displaying architectural drawings of the proposed building.

Mr. Anderson expressed some doubts as to the feasibility of such a method of financing the project. The Board thanked Messrs. Hiden and Hawkins for their presentation and requested them to explore further the possibilities of financing their building and to report to the Board at its next meeting. MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE MATTERS NEW BUILDINGS A verbal report for the Committee on Mary Washington College was made by Mrs. Wailes, Chairman. Mrs. Wailes pointed out that the need for certain new buildings at Mary Washington was becoming crucial, particularly an addition to the cold storage plant and a new infirmary. She proposed the following resolution, which was adopted by the Board. RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Governor be requested to release the appropriations approved by the General Assembly for construction to meet emergency building requirements, i. e., a cold storage plant of $40,000 which necessitates an addition to the dining hall building ($109,115), and an infirmary of $158,837.
