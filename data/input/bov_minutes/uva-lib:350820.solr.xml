This matter was considered by the Academic Deans at a meeting with the President on 16 December 1963, and the consensus was that a University-wide policy was needed under which a retiring faculty member would automatically release all space he occupied at the time of retirement. If space was available after the needs of the school were met, the Dean would then assign space for a period of one year with renewals permitted To effectuate this policy, the following resolution was adopted RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that effective 1 July 1964, all University space occupied by retiring faculty members shall be released as of the effective date of the retirement, provided, however, that the Dean of the College or School concerned may, after all requirements of the College or School have been met, assign space to retired faculty members for a period not to exceed one year with annual renewals being permitted subject to the same condition REPORT OF THE HOSPITAL ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE The following resolution was adopted RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 1185, 1186, 1189, 1190, 1192, 1193, 1196, and 1197, aggregating $158,807.09, as recommended by it, consisting of the following Bad debts, etc. $ 34,440.57 Free service to counties and cities 124,366.52 Total $158,807.09 ARCHITECTS FOR JAG BUILDING The President reported that the Judge Advocate Generals Office had requested the University to construct a new building for the School to be amortized by rental charges to be paid by the JAG School. The President reminded the Board that the present building now occupied by the JAG School was built by means of a loan from the State Treasury which would be completely amortized during 1964. At present, the JAG School, in addition to occupying its own building, also has space in Clark Hall. Construction of the new building would release this space in Clark Hall, which is now needed by the School of Law The President reported further that the consultants to the Long-Range Master Site Planning Committee had recommended that a court be established between Clark Hall and the present JAG School building and that the new JAG building be constructed as the east portion of that court. The other building to the west of the proposed location of the JAG School building, which will complete the court, will be needed by the School of Law, according to the consultants, in about 10 years The President stated that his Architectural Advisory Committee had recommended to him the firm of Rawlings and Wilson, Architects of Richmond, Virginia, as the architects for the new building. The President noted that this firm served as the architects for the married student housing project and had performed in excellent fashion After discussion, the following resolution was adopted RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to employ the firm of Rawlings and Wilson, Architects of Richmond, Virginia, as the architects for the new JAG School building EXCHANGE OF PROPERTIES WEST OF EMMET STREET The President reported that Dr. Charles W. Hurt and Mr. William W. Stevenson, owners of a strip of land lying west of Emmet Street and to the south and east of the Duke property recently acquired by the University had approached the Comptroller with respect to effecting an exchange of portions of their respective properties and that after study the proposed exchange appeared to be mutually advantageous. Hurt and Stevenson, in addition to the exchange of the parcels of real estate, proposed to pay the University the sum of $1,000.00 The President then submitted to the Board a copy of a plat showing the properties to be exchanged and drafts of the deeds carrying out the exchange and setting forth the terms and conditions upon which it was to be made After discussion, the following resolution was adopted RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, subject to the approval of the governor, which approval is required by Section 23-77.1 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, the exchange of parcels of land between the University of Virginia and Dr. Charles W. Hurt and Mr. William W. Stevenson, upon the terms and conditions outlined to this Board, be and the same hereby is approved, and RESOLVED FURTHER that Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., President and Weldon Cooper, Secretary, be and they are hereby authorized, empowered, and directed to execute and deliver on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a deed conveying to Messrs. Hurt and Stevenson, the parcel owned by the University to be exchanged JAMES MONROE LAW OFFICE - MUSEUM AND MEMORIAL LIBRARY The President reported that a bill had been introduced in the State Senate which would, by a deed of gift, vest the ownership of the James Monroe Law Office - Museum and Memorial Library located in Fredericksburg, Virginia in the Commonwealth of Virginia as "a part of the property of the University of Virginia subject to the ordinary powers of its Board of Visitors." This property is now owned by the James Monroe Memorial Foundation. The bill as introduced would establish a Board of Regents, one member of which would be the President of the University of Virginia, with the principal duty of managing and supervising the Memorial A general discussion ensued which centered principally on the relationships between the Board of Regents of the Memorial and the Board of Visitors of the University. Several members expressed the view that conflicts might arise between the two Boards because of the failure of the deed of gift to make clear the power of the Board of Visitors to decide finally in those instances when a conflict did arise. The consensus of the discussion was that the President would consult with the Attorney General's office and officials of the James Monroe Memorial Foundation for the purpose of clarifying the terms of the deed of gift on this point COMMITTEE ON SPECIAL RECOGNITION The Board discussed the possibility of devising ways and means to give special recognition to those persons who have been outstanding benefactors of the University. In most other institutions, the device is the award of an honorary degree. Following the views of the Founder, however, the University of Virginia has never awarded an honorary degree and the Board was unanimous in its opinion that no such practice should be started After discussion, the following resolution was adopted RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Rector, with the advice of the President, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to appoint a special committee to consider ways and means, if appropriate, of giving special recognition to those individuals who by their acts have shown themselves to be outstanding benefactors of the University of Virginia [Subsequently the Rector, on 17 February 1964, appointed a Committee on Special Recognition consisting of Langbourne M. Williams, Chairman, Hunter Faulconer, and Frank W. Rogers.] MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE MATTERS ELECTION The following resolution was adopted RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following person be and she is hereby elected to the faculty Mrs. Mary W.

We received notice of this bequest from the State-Planters Bank of Commerce and Trusts, executors and trustees of the estate. They estimate the College interest in the estate to be approximately $2,500. We understand, however, that this may be a conservative estimate and the sum may be substantially greater. The proceeds are to be used as scholarship funds to assist worthy students in need of financial assistance ALUMNAE ASSOCIATION GIFT The Chancellor reported that, in June 1961, the Alumnae Association of the College gave to the Chancellor an unrestricted gift of $5,000 to be used for awarding fellowships either to Mary Washington undergraduates or graduates or Mary Washington College faculty.
