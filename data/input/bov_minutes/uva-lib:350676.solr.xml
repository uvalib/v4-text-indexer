MEDICAL TUITION FOR G.I.'S Appearing for discussion of this matter were Dr. H. E. Jordan, Dean of the Medical School, and three representatives of the Veterans Administration. Dr. Jordan explained the problems arising as a result of the new tuition rates in the Medical School, which work a hardship on G.I. students. The representatives of the Veterans Administration explained the operation of the laws governing the education of veterans. After an extended discussion the whole question was referred to President Darden, directing him to devise a plan, through scholarships or otherwise, for the University to absorb fees of G.I.'s in CITY-COUNTY-UNIVERSITY HEALTH CONTRACT Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, and Dr. H. E. Jordan, Dean of the Medical School, were present for discussion of this matter. The following report was submitted by Dr. H. E. Jordan, Chairman of a Committee appointed at the July 11, 1947 meeting of the Board to study the present contract between the University of Virginia Hospital and the City of Charlottesville and County of Albemarle regarding the hospitalization of indigent persons: The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia Gentlemen: At a meeting of the Board of Visitors held July 11, 1947, a committee composed of Dr. H. E. Jordan, Dr. C. S. Lentz, and W. Allan Perkins, as Attorney for the University, was appointed for the purpose of making a study and submitting a report to the Board upon the general subject of the University's responsibility for the care and treatment in its hospital of indigent patients under the terms of existing contracts with the City of Charlottesville and with the County of Albemarle. This committee now begs to submit the following report- FIRST We find that the only contract between the University and the City of Charlottesville which provides for the general care and treatment of indigent patients from the City of Charlottesville is dated October 7, 1915, is in many of its terms obsolete, and, as years have gone by, many of its provisions have been radically changed in practice so that at the present time that contract is not in form satisfactory either to the University or to the City. This contract contains a provision that it may be terminated by either of the parties thereto upon sixty days notice to the other party of the intention to terminate. We therefore recommend that notice be at once given by the University to the City of the University's intention to terminate this contract. SECOND There have been four contracts entered into by the University, County of Albemarle, and City of Charlottesville, the purpose of each of these being to provide for the creation and operation of a joint Department of Health for the University, County and City. The first of these contracts was dated November 19, 1930, the last was dated as of July 1, 1940, and as each of these superseded the preceding one the contract of July 1, 1940 is the only of these contracts that is now in operation. Your Committee feels that on the whole this contract fairly well serves the purpose for which it was intended, but that in some of its particulars it should be amended so as to more nearly meet conditions as they now exist. The Council of the City of Charlottesville and the Board of Supervisors of Albemarle County have each recently appointed special committees for the purpose of formulating a new contract under which the Joint Department of Health is to be operated, and your Committee feels that it is important that the University should also have a committee appointed to confer with the committees from the City and County so that a new Joint Health Department contract may be prepared in form satisfactory to all three of the contracting parties. We therefore recommend the appointment of a committee for that purpose. THIRD We have found that the University and the County of Albemarle have never had any form of contract providing for the care and treatment in the University Hospital of indigent patients from the County. Our only contracts with the County dealing with the subject of health have been those providing for the joint Department of Health, above referred to and the only provision in the contract of July 1, 1940, under which we are now operating on this subject is the provision that"In consideration of an annual appropriation of undetermined amount by the County to the University Hospital said University agrees that its Hospital will give preference to the care and treatment of all indigent patients from said County which the Health Officer may certify to be a menace to public health." Your Committee therefore also recommends that a committee be appointed whose duty it shall be to consult with City and County authorities and to negotiate new contracts for the care and treatment in the Hospital of indigent patients from each of these localities, such contracts to be in the form promulgated by the State Department of Health pursuant to Chapter 197 of the Acts of Assembly of 1946, as amended by Acts of Extra Session of 1947, Page 72. Respectfully submitted, September 9, 1947, /s/ H. E. Jordan /s/ C. S. Lentz /s/ W. Allan Perkins Upon consideration whereof, upon motion duly made and seconded, it was unanimously - RESOLVED that, pursuant to the recommendations of the Special Committee embodied in the foregoing report, (1) The President is hereby instructed to give notice to the City of Charlottesville of the University's intention to terminate the contract between the University and the City of Charlottesville, dated October 7, 1915, referred to in said report, date of termination of said contract to be fixed as of December 1, 1947; (2) The President is hereby authorized to appoint a committee of not less than three nor more than five members whose duty it shall be to confer with committees appointed by the Council of the City of Charlottesville and by the Board of Supervisors of Albemarle County upon the subject of a new contract for the maintenance and operation of a Joint Health Department to take the place of the existing contract (3) That the President is hereby authorized to appoint another committee consisting of not less than three nor more than five whose duty it shall be to consult with authorities of the City of Charlottesville and County of Albemarle and to undertake to negotiate new contracts for the care and treatment in the University Hospital of indigent patients in each of these localities, such contracts to be in the form promulgated by the State Department of Health pursuant to Chapter 197 of the Acts of Assembly of 1946 as amended by Acts of Extra Session of 1947, Page 72. RE-FINANCING LOAN ON KAPPA SIGMA FRATERNITY Visitor: Mr. Perkins Mr. Perkins recommended continuance of this matter until a further study could be made. LOAN FOR THETA CHI FRATERNITY Application was made to the Board by Xi Chapter Alumni Association of Theta Chi Fraternity for a loan of $8,500.00 of which $4,431.99 is balance of principal due as of July 1, 1946, by said Association on loan of $6,000.00 heretofore made to it by the University on May 28, 1940, and $4,068.01 is an additional amount to be used by said Association, approximately $3,000.00 in paying off its secondary indebtedness and the balance in making repairs to its Fraternity House. It is proposed by said Association that said new loan shall be evidenced by its bond for $8,500.00 dated as of July 1, 1946, and payable on amortization basis over a period of eighteen years in nine monthly payments, during each year, with interest at 4% per annum, said nine monthly payments to be in the sum of $73.81 each and to be made on the first days of January, February, March, April, May, June, October, November and December of each year, the first of said payments to be made on the first day of October, 1947, which bond shall be secured by a deed of trust on the Association's lease of the lot on the northeast slope of Carr's Hill upon which its Chapter house is located, said deed to be in the same general form as the existing deed of trust which is dated May 28, 1940 and recorded in the Clerk's Office of Albemarle County in Deed Book 246, page 554. Upon consideration of this application the question of whether the proposed loan shall be made, and if made, how much should be lent to this Fraternity was referred to the Finance Committee with power to act. RITCHIE PROPERTY Visitor: Mr. Perkins The proposal to purchase the Ritchie Property adjoining Piedmont was referred to the Buildings and Grounds Committee. CHILD GUIDANCE CLINIC A proposal by the Department of Psychiatry to make changes in the Hospital to accommodate the Child Guidance Clinic was referred to the President with power to act. AWARD OF BAYLY-TIFFANY SCHOLARSHIPS In order to clarify the policy of the University concerning award of Beyly-Tiffany scholarships, upon motion duly made and seconded, it was - RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that award of the Bayly-Tiffany Scholarships is to be made to women or men alike without discrimination. REPAIR OF "FOUR ACRES" Mr. Perkins reported the completion of the purchase of "Four Acres" at a price of $40,000.00. Because of the inability of the Buildings and Grounds Department to repair "Four Acres" immediately, the Rector urged that the President be authorized to employ a private contractor to complete the work as soon as possible. Upon consideration of this suggestion, upon motion duly made and seconded, it was unanimously approved. INSTRUCTORS - APPROVAL OF BY BOARD Mr. Gay expressed the opinion that an instructor was a professor within the meaning of the statute empowering the Board of Visitors to select and appoint the latter. Although no specific resolution was passed, the majority of the Board felt that as a practical matter the President should be permitted to function. CONSULTANT ON STUDENT UNION The President asked that this matter be deferred until a later date, and it was so moved. PUBLIC DRUNKENNESS The President suggested that the present regulation concerning the keepings of spirits on University property and the mandatory expulsion of a University student convicted of drunkenness be rescinded and that broader regulations be drawn dealing with the control of intoxicants. This matter was referred to the President to prepare a report for the October meeting, and Mr. Gay was requested to prepare a resolution to cover cases now pending. FRATERNITY AND SORORITY MATTER The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that any student who transfers from another institution of higher learning to the University of Virginia with at least one year's college credit be permitted to join a fraternity or sorority upon admission to the University of Virginia. PUBLICITY OF MINUTES OF BOARD MEETINGS The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED that it is the sense of the Board that the minutes of the Board are public information and that the President is directed to prepare a summary of the minutes after each meeting for release to the press. SCHOOL OF FINE ARTS The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the question of the advisability of establishing a School of Fine Arts be referred to the Dean of the College, directing him to appoint a committee to study the question, having in view the establishment of courses in art leading to a B.A. degree in Fine Arts. REPORT OF FINANCE COMMITTEE The following report was submitted by the Finance Committee: TO: The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia - The Finance Committee respectfully reports as follows: I. On July 11th, 1947, a resolution was adopted by the Poard authorizing the payment of maintenance charges on the President's home up to the amount of $5,000 per year, and further authorizing that these charges be paid out of the unrestricted income of the Consolidated Endowment Funds of the University, provided that this course met with the approval of the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee has, with the assistance of Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, and Mr. Vincent Shea, the Bursar, carefully checked on the amount of unrestricted income from the Consolidated Endowment Funds, and it has been ascertained that there is ample unrestricted income to be used for the above purpose and that there is no legal obstacle to such use. II. At the meeting of the Board of Visitors held on June 13th, 1947, the matter of the purchase of a residence property located on Rugby Road and known as "Four Acres" for the use of Admiral Halsey while heading the University drive for endowment funds, was referred to Rector Stettinius and President Darden, with power to act. These gentlemen consulted the Finance Committee in regard to this matter, and after considerable correspondence it was decided that the purchase of this residence be made from the general income of the Consolidated Endowment Funds. The opinion of Mr. Allan Perkins was sought as to the legality of this and he has written the Finance Committee to the effect that it is within the power of the Board of Visitors to appropriate this income for the above stated purpose. Inquiry was then made of Mr. Vincent Shea, the Bursar, as to whether the use of $40,000 of this income would cramp the University in any of its other efforts, and the reply was received that this result would not obtain. It was also ascertained that there was sufficient available unrestricted income for this purpose. On August 29, 1947 Mr. Allan Perkins reported to the Finance Committee that he had closed the transaction for the purchase of "Four Acres." III. There was referred to the Finance Committee the question of the handling of a certain trust fund created by the will of Evelyn May Bayly Tiffany, by the trustee, the Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company of Baltimore. Without going into any great detail in this matter, the trustee has proposed that certain of the securities of the trust be sold at a profit and certain other securities be purchased enabling the trust to have available a sufficient income so as to be able to pay the annuities provided thereunder out of the income and thus preserve the principal of the trust which has been left to the University upon the death of the annuitants. The members of the Finance Committee have now studied this plan carefully and have come to the conclusion that the proposal of the trustee should be adopted. The Committee respectfully requests that the Board pass a resolution approving the proposal of the trustee. IV. The State-Planters Bank &amp; Trust Company which is acting as financial adviser for the Board in the investment of funds under the control of the Board, has proposed that an agreement be entered into between it and the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. This agreement is supplemental to the Agency Agreement dated December 13, 1946 now in effect between the Board and the State-Planters Bank &amp; Trust Company. The State-Planters Bank &amp; Trust Company points out that there are occasions when it is advisable to join in the lease, mortgage, consolidation, merger, foreclosure or reorganization of some corporation or other organization, the bonds, stocks or other securities of which are contained in the Agency Agreement, or to pool the voting rights, or to deposit the securities with some protective committee or some committee representing security holders, or to vote securities, whether they be stocks or bonds, in favor of or against some such plan or reorganization, and to take and hold securities or investments issued under such a plan or reorganization and to pay assessments involved therein. There does not appear in the present Agency Agreement any specific authority granted to the Finance Committee to give to the Bank instructions along these lines; nor is there in the agreement any authority for the Bank, as agent of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, to accept and act upon any such instructions. Of course, both of these powers might be implied, but the trustee desires that they be specifically stated and this is the purpose of the proposed Memorandum of Agreement. The Finance Committee has considered the matter and is of the opinion that the agreement should be entered into. It respectfully requests that a resolution be passed authorizing and directing the proper officers of the Board to sign, seal, attest and deliver the Memorandum of Agreement, copy of which is attached to this report. Respectfully submitted, /s/ Barron F. Black /s/ Thomas B. Gay /s/ Maitland Bustard September 9, 1947.

Black Rector Vincent Shea Secretary</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia Gentlemen: At a meeting of the Board of Visitors held July 11, 1947, a committee composed of Dr. H. E. Jordan, Dr. C. S. Lentz, and W. Allan Perkins, as Attorney for the University, was appointed for the purpose of making a study and submitting a report to the Board upon the general subject of the University's responsibility for the care and treatment in its hospital of indigent patients under the terms of existing contracts with the City of Charlottesville and with the County of Albemarle. This committee now begs to submit the following report- FIRST We find that the only contract between the University and the City of Charlottesville which provides for the general care and treatment of indigent patients from the City of Charlottesville is dated October 7, 1915, is in many of its terms obsolete, and, as years have gone by, many of its provisions have been radically changed in practice so that at the present time that contract is not in form satisfactory either to the University or to the City. This contract contains a provision that it may be terminated by either of the parties thereto upon sixty days notice to the other party of the intention to terminate. We therefore recommend that notice be at once given by the University to the City of the University's intention to terminate this contract. SECOND There have been four contracts entered into by the University, County of Albemarle, and City of Charlottesville, the purpose of each of these being to provide for the creation and operation of a joint Department of Health for the University, County and City. The first of these contracts was dated November 19, 1930, the last was dated as of July 1, 1940, and as each of these superseded the preceding one the contract of July 1, 1940 is the only of these contracts that is now in operation. Your Committee feels that on the whole this contract fairly well serves the purpose for which it was intended, but that in some of its particulars it should be amended so as to more nearly meet conditions as they now exist. The Council of the City of Charlottesville and the Board of Supervisors of Albemarle County have each recently appointed special committees for the purpose of formulating a new contract under which the Joint Department of Health is to be operated, and your Committee feels that it is important that the University should also have a committee appointed to confer with the committees from the City and County so that a new Joint Health Department contract may be prepared in form satisfactory to all three of the contracting parties. We therefore recommend the appointment of a committee for that purpose. THIRD We have found that the University and the County of Albemarle have never had any form of contract providing for the care and treatment in the University Hospital of indigent patients from the County. Our only contracts with the County dealing with the subject of health have been those providing for the joint Department of Health, above referred to and the only provision in the contract of July 1, 1940, under which we are now operating on this subject is the provision that"In consideration of an annual appropriation of undetermined amount by the County to the University Hospital said University agrees that its Hospital will give preference to the care and treatment of all indigent patients from said County which the Health Officer may certify to be a menace to public health." Your Committee therefore also recommends that a committee be appointed whose duty it shall be to consult with City and County authorities and to negotiate new contracts for the care and treatment in the Hospital of indigent patients from each of these localities, such contracts to be in the form promulgated by the State Department of Health pursuant to Chapter 197 of the Acts of Assembly of 1946, as amended by Acts of Extra Session of 1947, Page 72. Respectfully submitted, September 9, 1947, /s/ H. E. Jordan /s/ C. S. Lentz /s/ W. Allan Perkins</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO: The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia - The Finance Committee respectfully reports as follows: I. On July 11th, 1947, a resolution was adopted by the Poard authorizing the payment of maintenance charges on the President's home up to the amount of $5,000 per year, and further authorizing that these charges be paid out of the unrestricted income of the Consolidated Endowment Funds of the University, provided that this course met with the approval of the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee has, with the assistance of Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, and Mr. Vincent Shea, the Bursar, carefully checked on the amount of unrestricted income from the Consolidated Endowment Funds, and it has been ascertained that there is ample unrestricted income to be used for the above purpose and that there is no legal obstacle to such use. II. At the meeting of the Board of Visitors held on June 13th, 1947, the matter of the purchase of a residence property located on Rugby Road and known as "Four Acres" for the use of Admiral Halsey while heading the University drive for endowment funds, was referred to Rector Stettinius and President Darden, with power to act. These gentlemen consulted the Finance Committee in regard to this matter, and after considerable correspondence it was decided that the purchase of this residence be made from the general income of the Consolidated Endowment Funds. The opinion of Mr. Allan Perkins was sought as to the legality of this and he has written the Finance Committee to the effect that it is within the power of the Board of Visitors to appropriate this income for the above stated purpose. Inquiry was then made of Mr. Vincent Shea, the Bursar, as to whether the use of $40,000 of this income would cramp the University in any of its other efforts, and the reply was received that this result would not obtain. It was also ascertained that there was sufficient available unrestricted income for this purpose. On August 29, 1947 Mr. Allan Perkins reported to the Finance Committee that he had closed the transaction for the purchase of "Four Acres." III. There was referred to the Finance Committee the question of the handling of a certain trust fund created by the will of Evelyn May Bayly Tiffany, by the trustee, the Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company of Baltimore. Without going into any great detail in this matter, the trustee has proposed that certain of the securities of the trust be sold at a profit and certain other securities be purchased enabling the trust to have available a sufficient income so as to be able to pay the annuities provided thereunder out of the income and thus preserve the principal of the trust which has been left to the University upon the death of the annuitants. The members of the Finance Committee have now studied this plan carefully and have come to the conclusion that the proposal of the trustee should be adopted. The Committee respectfully requests that the Board pass a resolution approving the proposal of the trustee. IV. The State-Planters Bank &amp; Trust Company which is acting as financial adviser for the Board in the investment of funds under the control of the Board, has proposed that an agreement be entered into between it and the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. This agreement is supplemental to the Agency Agreement dated December 13, 1946 now in effect between the Board and the State-Planters Bank &amp; Trust Company. The State-Planters Bank &amp; Trust Company points out that there are occasions when it is advisable to join in the lease, mortgage, consolidation, merger, foreclosure or reorganization of some corporation or other organization, the bonds, stocks or other securities of which are contained in the Agency Agreement, or to pool the voting rights, or to deposit the securities with some protective committee or some committee representing security holders, or to vote securities, whether they be stocks or bonds, in favor of or against some such plan or reorganization, and to take and hold securities or investments issued under such a plan or reorganization and to pay assessments involved therein. There does not appear in the present Agency Agreement any specific authority granted to the Finance Committee to give to the Bank instructions along these lines; nor is there in the agreement any authority for the Bank, as agent of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, to accept and act upon any such instructions. Of course, both of these powers might be implied, but the trustee desires that they be specifically stated and this is the purpose of the proposed Memorandum of Agreement. The Finance Committee has considered the matter and is of the opinion that the agreement should be entered into. It respectfully requests that a resolution be passed authorizing and directing the proper officers of the Board to sign, seal, attest and deliver the Memorandum of Agreement, copy of which is attached to this report. Respectfully submitted, /s/ Barron F. Black /s/ Thomas B. Gay /s/ Maitland Bustard September 9, 1947.</field>
