The Finance Committee, acting for the Board of Visitors, will normally vote on all proxy resolutions in the manner recommended by company management. Where the Finance Committee decides that a proxy resolution calls for company action or inaction for primarily social, as opposed to business, reasons, the Finance Committee will normally abstain from voting on the proxy unless it decides otherwise after receiving and considering the President's recommendation for a vote, and the report of the Proxy Advisory Committee described below. 2. The Finance Committee's decision concerning voting or abstaining on proxy resolutions will be implemented by the Vice President for Business and Finance (the "Vice President"). 3. The Vice President will identify to the Finance Committee all proxy resolutions which the Vice President feels call for company action or inaction for primarily social, as opposed to business, reasons. 4. The Proxy Advisory Committee (the "Committee") will consist of eleven persons appointed by the President, with three of the members to be faculty, three students, three alumni and two University administrators. In addition, the University's Investment Officer will act as an ex-officio, nonvoting member of the Committee. The President will appoint the Chairman. The Committee members will serve for a period of one year and the President will not make appointments for beyond the initial one year period unless the Finance Committee so directs. 5. The Committee will serve as an advisory committee to the President. The Committee will perform the following duties and such additional or different, but related, duties as the President may from time to time direct: a. Receive from the University's Investment Officer such University endowment security proxy materials and related information as the Committee may request. b. Review the resolutions identified by the Vice President as calling for company action or inaction for primarily social, as opposed to business, reasons and recommend to the President any changes. c. Identify to the President the resolutions which the Committee feels involve issues of such major significance that the Committee should proceed to study the issues. d. Study the issues identified to the Committee in writing by the President. As part of each such study, the Committee may receive any petitions or other documents which members of the University community wish to present and may allow members of the University community an opportunity to present orally information and their views. The Committee's Chairman may appoint such subcommittees as he or she wishes to further the study. Each study will involve thorough research, analysis and conclusions concerning the effects and implications to the company, society and the University of passage, and defeat, of the proxy resolutions involved, and of the University voting in favor of, and against, the resolutions. The Committee will consider its own members' opinions on issues and those of substantial portions of the University community. e. Submit to the President the Committee's written report of each such study. The Committee's report will describe the majority of the Committee members' recommendations as to whether the Finance Committee should vote on pending or possible future proxy resolutions and, if so, how. Individual Committee members may submit separate reports with concurring or dissenting recommendations. The Committee's report will contain a full description of the Committee's study procedure, research findings, analysis and conclusions. f. Upon request, appear before the President, the Vice President or the Finance Committee to respond to questions concerning the Committee's studies, reports or activities. 6. The President may submit any report of the Committee to the Finance Committee along with the President's recommendations on the matter. 7. The President will inform the Committee of any decision by the Finance Committee concerning issues addressed in a Committee report. The Committee will communicate such decisions to members of the University community as the President may direct.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ATTACHMENT I Assistant Vice President for Finance TELEPHONE (804) 979-3294 May 28, 1982 Mr. Myron E. Tremain Senior Vice President Virginia National Bank 300 East Main Street P. O. Box 1328 Charlottesville, Virginia 22902 Re: Banking Services under the University's Amended Request for Proposal Dated April 9, 1982 Dear Mike: The University wishes to contract with Virginia National Bank for banking services, subject to the terms described in this letter. If these terms are acceptable to VNB, the contract with the University would be formed by VNB signing the enclosed copy of this letter where indicated and returning it to me. VNB would thereupon be the bank selected by the University under the University's Request for Proposal dated April 9, 1982 (the "RFP"). The terms of the parties' Agreement are as described in Attachments C and D to the RFP with only the following specific changes or elaborations: 1. This Agreement is entirely contingent on approval of it by the University's Board of Visitors at its meeting which begins next Thursday, June 3, 1982. The effective date of this Agreement, referred to in Section 1 of Attachment C to the RFP, will be the date the University's Board of Visitors approves the Agreement. 2. The "Services" referred to in Section 1 of Attachment C to the RFP will consist of all the services described in Attachment E to the RFP, as elaborated upon in Section IV of VNB's initial proposal (dated May, 1982), and its amendment dated May 26, 1982 as it relates to investment custody services. 3. The "term" of the Agreement will begin July 1, 1982, rather than on the date for beginning the Services as described in the first sentence of Section 2 of Attachment C to the RFP. 4. With regard to the second sentence of Section 2 of Attachment C to the RFP, it is agreed that the initial two-year term will be automatically extended for an additional two-year period, subject to that sentence's termination provision. If VNB decides that it will invoke the termination provision if its prices are not increased, the parties will discuss the proposed increases and the University will determine whether this Agreement should be modified or whether another request for proposal should be issued. 5. With regard to Section 3(a) of Attachment C to the RFP, the University will compensate VNB for the Services in the manner described in Section 3(a)(i), using the "fee prices" described in the pricing form contained in Section VII of VNB's initial proposal, as amended by VNB's May 26, 1982 amendment relating to investment custody services. VNB reserves the right to increase the fee prices for particular Services in the amount of any future price increase which VNB is charged in connection with those Services by regulatory authorities such as the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Also, any earnings on the University's balances with VNB during each month will be credited against the total fees for Services provided by VNB during the same month. For the purpose of determining these balances earnings credits, the parties will use the average moving discount rate for the prior month of the 91-day U. S. Treasury Bills. The account analyses referred to in Section 3(a)(i) will be modified appropriately to indicate the amount of, and method of computing, these credits. 6. With regard to Section 9 of Attachment D to the RFP, the name and address of the person to whom notices to VNB will be sent will be your name and address as shown at the beginning of this letter. The Agreement described in this letter does not, of course, constitute the terms which VNB and the Treasurer of Virginia may decide to agree to for the Treasurer's account as described in the RFP. You should deal directly with the Treasurer's Office concerning any such agreement. After I receive from you the executed copy of this letter, I will proceed to submit this Agreement to the Board of Visitors for its consideration. Thank you and the University certainly looks forward to dealing with VNB. Sincerely, Peter L. Munger Assistant Vice President for Finance, on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia The terms of the above letter are agreed to: VIRGINIA NATIONAL BANK By Name: Title: Date:</field>
