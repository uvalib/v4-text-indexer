The Attorney for the University, W. Allan Perkins, made the following report on the death of Miss Mary C. Glover, a trained nurse attached to the staff of the University Hospital, which was received and unanimously adopted: April 8th, 1932. To The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. Gentlemen: On the 20th of February, 1932, Miss Mary Glover, a trained nurse attached to the staff of the University Hospital, in the discharge of some of her duties about the Hospital, came out of the building and started across the parking space at the rear of the Hospital. Tanner Slaughter, a colored man, employed as janitor at the Biological Laboratory, had been sent to the Hospital to get some distilled water for use at the Laboratory. He had driven his own car, an old T-Model Ford, to the Hospital, had parked it in the parking space, had gotten the water, and just as Miss Glover approached the spot where the automobile was parked, Slaughter undertook to crank his machine, preparatory to returning to the Biological Laboratory. Just as Miss Glover reached a point at the rear of Slaughter's car, the engine of the car started, and in some way the mechanism of the reverse gear of the car became engaged and the car was driven violently backward, running over Miss Glover and killing her almost instantly. Miss Glover is survived by a brother and a sister, neither of whom was in any way dependent upon her. She is survived also by her mother, Mrs. Isabel Glover. At the time of Miss Glover's death and for six months prior thereto, her mother had been living with her in a room which Miss Glover rented in Charlottesville, and had been entirely dependent for her support upon the earnings of her daughter, which, at the time of her death, amounted to $37.50 per week. The facts with reference to the total dependency, and all other facts connected with the accident, have been thoroughly investigated both by Mr. Carruthers and by myself. Tanner Slaughter had no public liability insurance upon his car, and, in our opinion, the case is one of liability upon the University under the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Law of Virginia. Under Section 39 of that law burial expenses not exceeding $150.00 should be paid, and compensation should be paid to the dependent mother at the rate of $14.00 per week for a period of three hundred weeks. I beg to present for your consideration copy of contract prepared on Form #35 of the Industrial Commission of Virginia, under which we agree to pay Mrs. Glover the amounts referred to above. It is my recommendation that the Board adopt the following resolution - "Upon consideration of the facts attending the fatal injury to Miss Mary Glover, which occurred at the University Hospital on the 20th of February, 1932, taking into consideration the fact that Mrs. Isabel Glover, mother of said Miss Mary Glover, was entirely dependent upon her said daughter at the time of the accident, it is, RESOLVED, that Mr. John L. Newcomb, Acting President, be and is hereby requested to execute the contract presented to this Board by the Attorney for the University, under which the University agrees to pay the said Mrs. Glover the sum of $150.00, burial expenses, and compensation at the rate of $14.00 per week, payable each week for three hundred weeks from the date of said injury, February 20th, 1932, or until her death if death occurs before expiration of said three hundred weeks, and E. I. Carruthers, Bursar of the University, is hereby authorized and requested to make the payments to said Mrs. Glover, provided for under said contract." Respectfully submitted, W. Allan Perkins, Attorney. The Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund submitted report of the action taken at its meeting of April 14, 1932, with respect to the appropriation of funds in its care. The report was received and approved: Upon motion of Mr. Tunstall, duly seconded, Mr. R.

(B) From the Income of the Jefferson Memorial Fund. (1) To the VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW, the sum of $1,000, payable to the Business Manager of said REVIEW, at his request. (2) To Miss Rosa T. Bilisoly, payable July 1, 1932, for services rendered the Treasurer and Board during the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1931, the sum of $100. (3) To the University of Virginia, payable in equal quarterly instalments, beginning September 15, 1932, the sum of $40,000, from which the University shall provide for the support of the Walter Reed School of Pathology; The James Madison School of Law; The James Monroe School of International Law; The James Wilson School of Political Science and Economy; The Edgar Allen Poe School of English; and the Andrew Carnegie School of Engineering, and make the following allocations: (a) For the Curry Memorial School of Education; The Barbour Page Lecture Fund; The Isaac Cary Scholarship; the income from the securities held in these funds respectively by the First and Merchants National Bank. (b) For such other purposes as may be, or have been, specially designated by the donors, the income arising from the gifts made by these donors respectively. (C) From the Income of both Funds. The entire balance of the net income, after the payment of all other appropriations, including any unexpended balances from the appropriations hereinbefore made, to the President of the University for such purposes as may be determined upon by him, except as shall have been otherwise directed by the Board, the said balance to be set aside by the said agents and custodians on July 1, 1932, and to be paid out by them from time to time on the written instructions of the President, provided, that at the next annual meeting the President shall make a report to the Board of the purpose or purposes so determined upon by him, and the amount expended therefor. With respect to the appointment of a committee on Institute of Public Affairs the following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED, That a committee consisting of the Acting President and two members from the Board of Visitors be appointed to confer with Dr. Chas. G. Maphis, Director of the Institute of Public Affairs, and to advise with him as to the program and general conduct of the Institute. The Rector appointed on the above committee Messrs. Lewis C. Williams and R. Gray Williams. Application of Professor A. F. Macconochie for a loan of $8,000 on his residence was granted in the following resolution adopted: RESOLVED, That a loan of $8,000 be granted to Professor A. F. Macconochie on his residence at Farmington to be secured by first lien and a life insurance policy of not less than $3,000; said loan to be repaid at the rate of $1,000 per year after the first year, or, on such other terms as to repayment as may be agreeable to the Chairman of the Finance Committee. The budget for 1932-33 was presented by Acting President Newcomb and explained in detail by him as to the increases and decreases in estimated income and expenses and, aft a full discussion of its contents by the members of the Board, it was adopted in the following resolution: RESOLVED, BY THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, That the financial budget of the University of Virginia for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1932 and ending June 30, 1933, showing estimated receipts of $2,032,340.00, and estimated expenditures of $2,013,931.00, be and the same is hereby adopted, with the following restrictions: 1.

Just as Miss Glover reached a point at the rear of Slaughter's car, the engine of the car started, and in some way the mechanism of the reverse gear of the car became engaged and the car was driven violently backward, running over Miss Glover and killing her almost instantly. Miss Glover is survived by a brother and a sister, neither of whom was in any way dependent upon her. She is survived also by her mother, Mrs. Isabel Glover. At the time of Miss Glover's death and for six months prior thereto, her mother had been living with her in a room which Miss Glover rented in Charlottesville, and had been entirely dependent for her support upon the earnings of her daughter, which, at the time of her death, amounted to $37.50 per week. The facts with reference to the total dependency, and all other facts connected with the accident, have been thoroughly investigated both by Mr. Carruthers and by myself. Tanner Slaughter had no public liability insurance upon his car, and, in our opinion, the case is one of liability upon the University under the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Law of Virginia. Under Section 39 of that law burial expenses not exceeding $150.00 should be paid, and compensation should be paid to the dependent mother at the rate of $14.00 per week for a period of three hundred weeks. I beg to present for your consideration copy of contract prepared on Form #35 of the Industrial Commission of Virginia, under which we agree to pay Mrs. Glover the amounts referred to above. It is my recommendation that the Board adopt the following resolution - "Upon consideration of the facts attending the fatal injury to Miss Mary Glover, which occurred at the University Hospital on the 20th of February, 1932, taking into consideration the fact that Mrs. Isabel Glover, mother of said Miss Mary Glover, was entirely dependent upon her said daughter at the time of the accident, it is, RESOLVED, that Mr. John L. Newcomb, Acting President, be and is hereby requested to execute the contract presented to this Board by the Attorney for the University, under which the University agrees to pay the said Mrs. Glover the sum of $150.00, burial expenses, and compensation at the rate of $14.00 per week, payable each week for three hundred weeks from the date of said injury, February 20th, 1932, or until her death if death occurs before expiration of said three hundred weeks, and E. I. Carruthers, Bursar of the University, is hereby authorized and requested to make the payments to said Mrs. Glover, provided for under said contract." Respectfully submitted, W. Allan Perkins, Attorney.</field>
