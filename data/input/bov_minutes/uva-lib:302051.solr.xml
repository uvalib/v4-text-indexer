      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia June 11th, 1912. At the regular annual meeting of the Board of Visitors on above date, at 8:30 P.M., Present: The Rector, Visitors White, Craddock, Oliver, Irvine, Randolph, Superintendent Eggleston, and President Alderman.

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, By Armistead C. Gordon, Rector The President presented the following, which was unanimously adopted,— Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia in consideration of the distinguished service rendered by Daniel Harmon as a member of the Board of Visitors do establish in the Department of Law a scholarship to be entitled the "Harmon Scholarship." This scholarship shall carry exemption from all tuition and University fees and shall be eligible to a young Virginian of ability, character, and need. Resolved: That the selection of the site for the George Peabody Educational Building be left to a committee composed of the following: viz.-The President, the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, Chairman of the Executive Committee, Professors Newcomb and Maphis, with power to act, conditioned upon such selection being approved by Mr. Manning the consult- ing landscape architect of the University. On motion, the Board confirmed the action of the Executive Committee in approving the following resolutions of the Academic Faculty, at a meeting held on May 11, 1912. "Resolved: That the Academic Faculty recommend to the President and Visitors that C. W. Wagenerbe permitted to count the course in Electrical Engineering which he has completed, as an elective at large for the Baccalaureate Degree. This recommendation is also endorsed by the Engineering Faculty. "Resolved: That the Academic Faculty recommend to the President and Visitors of the University that W. P. Foster be permitted to offer for the Baccalaureate Degree, in lieu of the regular first year law course, a course embracing the following subjects; Contracts, Brief Making, Equity, Criminal Law, Evidence, Insurance, Negotiable Instruments, Torts, Carriers, and Bailments, Corporations, Agency, Public Corporations, Legal Ethics, and International Law. "This course is somewhat more extensive and difficult than the regular course. Mr. Foster desires to make this substitution in order that he may receive credit for a full years' work in law when he completes his law studies at the Louisiana State University. The application has the endorsement of the Dean of the Law School." Mr. Craddock, Chairman of the Finance Committee, having read a letter from Messrs. Kirkpatrick and Howard, concerning the Stearnes loan, it is hereby Resolved: That said letter be made a part of the minutes of this meeting, and that the Finance Committee is authorized to arrange the said loan as recommended in said letter if they shall approve the same. The letter follows: Lynchburg, Va., June 4, 1912. Mr. John W. Craddock, Chairman Finance Committee, University of Virginia, Lynchburg, Va. Dear Sir: The University of Virginia now holds a balance of $42,500.00 upon the L. P. Stearnes loan which matures in the following manner: $2500.00 on December 3d of each of the following years, 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915, and 1916, and $30,000.00 in 1918. Mr. Stearnes desires to somewhat change this serial method of maturity, and to negotiate a loan of $50,000.00 that will mature June 3, 1920. The security offered for this loan is valued by Mr. Stearnes as follows: Cash surrender value of four life insurance policies $18,670 00 His farm of over 1500 acres. 120,000 00 His town property in Pulaski 30,000 00 168,670 00 The life insurance is steadily increasing each year. As we recall it, it was approximately $12,000.00 when the loan was made three years ago. If the $18,000.00 be deducted from the total amount of the loan, there would be a balance of $32,000.00, which would be only $21.33 per acre upon 1500 acres of his farm land. This does not take into consideration his town property at all. Mr. Stearnes values his farm at $80.00 per acre. Judging by a sale which we recently made of a piece of adjourning farm lands, and which was by no means as valuable as Mr. Stearnes', we should say that $60.00 per acre is less than a very conservative value upon his farm. We believe that after crediting this loan by the cash surrender value of the policies that there is certainly not as little as $3.00 of security values for every dollar lent, and as all the policies, except one, will have matured at the time that the proposed loan matures, the value from this source alone will go far towards retiring the amount of the proposed loan. If the University has not $7,500.00 additional money to put into this new loan, we will cash, at par an accrued interest, by-an endorsement without recourse on the part of the University, $7,500.00 of the Samuel L. Matz loan which the University negotiated through this office. The advantage to the University in merging the Matz and the present Stearnes' loans into the proposed loan we believe is material. They would have a solid long time loan, upon security which, as far as the life insurance is concerned, would surely increase in value, and they would not be forced to take care of the five bonds of $2500.00 each that will be maturing during the next five years. The original loan on this property was $50,000.00, since which time both the life insurance and the farm have materially increased in value, the farm being cared for in a most prudent manner and is regarded as one of the finest estates in Southwest Virginia. As you have trusted us largely in the matter of all the securities which we have placed, we wish to say that the proposed loan has our unqualified approval. If this plan meets the approval of the Board of Visitors, we would be glad to be so informed. Yours truly, (signed) Kirkpatrick and Howard. The President presented the following correspondence which was ordered placed on record,- The Carnegie Foundation For the Advancement of Teaching 576 Fifth Avenue New York, May 10, 1912.

Dear Doctor Alderman: To you as President, and through you to the Rector and Visitors I hereby tender my resignation as Professor of Greek in the University of Virginia, to take effect September fifteenth, 1912. For nearly half a century I have been teaching the ancient languages. Twenty-five of those years I have spent at this Institution, working to the best of my smallability; and now my advancing age and its attendant infirmities convince me that my work can be done more efficiently by a younger man. In severing my connection with this University, I wish to thank you, Mr. President, and through you the Rector and Visitors, the Faculty, and all with whom I have been so pleasantly associated, for the kind and friendly consideration that I have received during my connection with this Institution, which connection I sever with the deepest regret. Respectfully submitted, (signed) Milton W. Humphreys, Professor of Greek. Office of the President. University of Virginia, May 11, 1912. Professor Ormond Stone, University of Virginia. My dear Professor Stone: I am in receipt of a communication from the Secretary of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching which contains this statement, "I have the honor to inform you that, in accordance with your recommendation and in conformity with the rules of the Carnegie Foundation, a retiring allowance has been voted to Ormond Stone, to be paid in the ordinary way through the University. This retiring allowance amounts to $2050.00. The allowance of Professor Stone will become effective on September 15, 1912." I have pleasure in repeating this communication to you, though it is mingled with profound regret that your long and distinguished service to this University is soon to end. You have won the regard and esteem of all connected with the Institution's life, and you will carry into your retirement the affection and good wishes of your colleagues and students. I would suggest that your resignation be sent in to me at any moment that may seem to you best. The next meeting of the Board which will consider the matter officially will be held about June 11. Very sincerely yours, (signed) Edwin A. Alderman, President. Leander MCCormick Observatory, University of Virginia, U.S.A. President E. A. Alderman, University of Virginia, June 5, 1912. Dear President Alderman:- Having been granted, in accordance with your recent letter, at my request, a retiring allowance by the Carnegie Foundation, I beg that you will kindly transmit to the Rector and Visitors my resignation as Professor of Astronomy, to take effect September 15th, next. In doing so I desire to express to you and the Faculty, as well as to the Rector and Visitors my sincere thanks for the many courtesies I have received during the thirty happy years I have spent at this University. May I also express the pleasure I have enjoyed in watching the growing spirit of progress which during these years has gradually infused       the life of the University, especially during the eight eventful years in which you have been its leader. I wish also to express my pleasure in noting the growing realization of the duty of the University constantly to readjust itself in order that it may with ever increasing efficiency contribute to the higher life of the people. In the firm belief that this spirit and this realization will continue to grow with the passing years, I lay down my work here with pride that I have been privileged for so long a time to be connected with an institution possessed of such splendid traditions, and (what is more important) inspired by such noble ambition to serve. With sincere personal esteem, I remain, cordially yours, (signed) Ormond Stone. Office of the President. University of Virginia, May 11, '12. Mr. I. K. Moran, Bursar, University of Virginia. My dear Mr. Moran: I have the honor to inform you that the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has this day notified me that a retiring allowance has been voted to Isaac Kimber Moran to be paid in the ordinary way through the University. This retiring allowance will become effective on October 1, 1912. The amount accorded to you is $1460.00. I have pleasure in repeating this communication to you, though it is mingled with profound regret that your long and distinguished service to this University is soon to end. You have won the regard and esteem of all connected with the Institution's life, and you will carry into your retirement the affection and good wishes of your colleagues. I would suggest that your resignation be sent in to me at any moment that may seem to you best. The next meeting of the Board which will consider the matter officially will be held about June 11. Very sincerely yours, (signed) Edwin A. Alderman, President. Office of the Bursar. University, Virginia, June 1, 1912. Dr. Edwin A. Alderman, President, University of Virginia. My dear Dr. Alderman: It has been known to you for some months past that I have had in contemplation the relinquishment of the offices with which the University has so long honored me. On account of advancing years, and a growing conviction that the rather exacting duties of my office should be committed to younger hands, I believe the time has now arrived when I should take this action, and therefore offer to you, to be by you transmitted to the Board of Visitors, my formal resignation as Bursar of the University, and also as Secretary to the Board of Visitors.

And further, let me assure you of my sincere gratitude for your very effective personal interest on my behalf, that has made possible my retirement under the present gratifying conditions.

      <field name="fulltext">Lynchburg, Va., June 4, 1912. Mr. John W. Craddock, Chairman Finance Committee, University of Virginia, Lynchburg, Va. Dear Sir: The University of Virginia now holds a balance of $42,500.00 upon the L. P. Stearnes loan which matures in the following manner: $2500.00 on December 3d of each of the following years, 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915, and 1916, and $30,000.00 in 1918. Mr. Stearnes desires to somewhat change this serial method of maturity, and to negotiate a loan of $50,000.00 that will mature June 3, 1920. The security offered for this loan is valued by Mr. Stearnes as follows: Cash surrender value of four life insurance policies $18,670 00 His farm of over 1500 acres. 120,000 00 His town property in Pulaski 30,000 00 168,670 00 The life insurance is steadily increasing each year. As we recall it, it was approximately $12,000.00 when the loan was made three years ago. If the $18,000.00 be deducted from the total amount of the loan, there would be a balance of $32,000.00, which would be only $21.33 per acre upon 1500 acres of his farm land. This does not take into consideration his town property at all. Mr. Stearnes values his farm at $80.00 per acre. Judging by a sale which we recently made of a piece of adjourning farm lands, and which was by no means as valuable as Mr. Stearnes', we should say that $60.00 per acre is less than a very conservative value upon his farm. We believe that after crediting this loan by the cash surrender value of the policies that there is certainly not as little as $3.00 of security values for every dollar lent, and as all the policies, except one, will have matured at the time that the proposed loan matures, the value from this source alone will go far towards retiring the amount of the proposed loan. If the University has not $7,500.00 additional money to put into this new loan, we will cash, at par an accrued interest, by-an endorsement without recourse on the part of the University, $7,500.00 of the Samuel L. Matz loan which the University negotiated through this office. The advantage to the University in merging the Matz and the present Stearnes' loans into the proposed loan we believe is material. They would have a solid long time loan, upon security which, as far as the life insurance is concerned, would surely increase in value, and they would not be forced to take care of the five bonds of $2500.00 each that will be maturing during the next five years. The original loan on this property was $50,000.00, since which time both the life insurance and the farm have materially increased in value, the farm being cared for in a most prudent manner and is regarded as one of the finest estates in Southwest Virginia. As you have trusted us largely in the matter of all the securities which we have placed, we wish to say that the proposed loan has our unqualified approval. If this plan meets the approval of the Board of Visitors, we would be glad to be so informed. Yours truly, (signed) Kirkpatrick and Howard.</field>
