Johnson Barbour Rector of Univ. of Virg. June 27th 1867 The Board met pursuant to adjournment. Present the same members as on yesterday. The Rector laid before the Board a Resolution of the Faculty recommending for reasons therein stated that the Degree of A. M. be conferred on Jourdan W. Roper without requiring him to graduate in the School of History &amp; Literature. On motion Resolved that the Board concede to Mr. Roper the Degree of A. M. as requested by the Faculty - but do so with reluctance, looking to the circumstances of the case, and with the distinct understanding that it shall not be held as a precedent. The Rector laid before the Board a letter from R. R. Prentis agent for Wm. H. Young formerly a student of the University, proposing to sell to the University the Dormitory built by said Young in 1859.

On motion Resolved, that the application of Professor Peters to form a class of Sanskrit in connection with the Chair of Latin be granted.

The Board of Visitors after considering the questions of jurisdiction and subordination which have arisen between the Superintendent and Chairman have reached the following conclusions. I. That the Chairman was undoubtedly correct in his construction of the laws - but to prevent further collision and difficulty it is deemed best for the present without touching the subordination of the Proctor, and still leaving the Chairman Chief executive officer in all things else, to place the Superintendent of Public Grounds &amp; Buildings under the more immediate control of the Executive Committee- and it is accordingly ordered that the Executive Committee shall meet at least once a month to confer with the Superintendent in reference to repairs, alterations and general improvements, and that in all things their decision shall be final. It is further understood that as far as possible all appropriations shall be specific, and in no instance shall either the Executive Committee or the Superintendent transcend the amount appropriated by the Board of Visitors - and it is further ordered that in all matters of importance the Executive Committee shall confer with the Chairman &amp; Faculty.
