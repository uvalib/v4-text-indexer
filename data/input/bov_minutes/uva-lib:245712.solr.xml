Smith, which is in the following words and figures: Prof. F. H. Smith, University of Virginia. Dear Sir: I have set aside the sum of $5000.00 to endow a Lectureship, for the perpetual defence of the truth of Christianity, and desire to have two institutions of high learning associated in the management of the said lectureship, one of them being a college and the other a University. For this purpose I have given in trust to Davidson College, N. C. (my Alma Mater) the sum of twenty five hundred dollars, and I now desire to give the legal authorities of the University of Virginia the sum of twenty five hundred dollars in trust for the same purpose, provided that the said University of Va. and the said Davidson College can be, and shall be associated in the management and benefit of said lectureship in a way agreeable to both of said institutions. In this donation it is to be understood and agreed to, that, 1st, only the income of the endowment fund shall be used in the expenses of the said lectureship; 2. A course of lectures, consisting of not less than four or more than six lectures, within the range of the following points, the eternal personality of God, the immortal personality of man, the divine inspiration of the Bible, and the truth of Christianity as revealed in the Bible, shall be, determined at both institutions as often as the income of the endowment fund shall justify; 3. The lectures of each course shall be, as soon after their delivery as practicable, published in book-form, and all the net proceeds of the sale thereof shall be added to the endowment fund of the lectureship, 4. The lecturer in every case shall be chosen by the joint agreement of the Faculties of the two institutions associated in the lectureship, and the lecturer thus chosen shall always be a man of acknowledged scholarship in the department of his lectures, and a member of some branch of the Christian Church holding the evangelical system of historical Christianity. And now I do hereby through you and Prof. N. K. Davis, offer to the Visitors of the University of Virginia the sum of $2500.00 in trust for this purpose, provided that a suitable and satisfactory agreement and arrangement shall be entered into by the legal authorities of the before mentioned institutions for carrying into effect this proposed joint lectureship; and I request you to present this offer to the Visitors of the University of Va at the earliest opportunity, and to request them, if the offer is accepted, to empower and authorize their executive committee to enter into conference with the Executive Committee of the Trustees of Davidson College, and with them to arrange all details pertaining to__ matter, with as little delay as possible. I am, Dear Sir, Yours very sincerely, J. M. P. Otts, Greensboro, Ala. And also a resolution of the Faculty commending the proposal in said letter, to the favorable consideration of the Visitors, which resolution reads as follows: The Faculty respectfully recommend to the Board of Visitors that the communication of the Rev. J. M. P. Otts, D. D. herewith forwarded, be favorably considered, and that the Executive Committee be authorized to accept the offer he makes. Minutes of the Faculty, 14 Aug. 95. The Visitors having considered the proposal contained in the letter, do Resolve that the offer of Dr Otts made in said letter be accepted. The Executive Committee is requested to make Dr Otts a suitable acknowledgment of his letter and offer and it is directed to enter into and make such agreement in writing with Dr Otts as may be necessary to carry into execution the contemplated purpose of Dr Otts offer and also to open correspondence with the Authorities of Davidson College and cooperate with them in formulating some plan to carry into practical operation the purposes of Dr Otts as set forth in his letter and to do anything necessary to that end. Resolved, that the resolution of June 10th 1895 apply to Hotel Keepers and any dormitories now used by the Hotel Keepers shall be vacated by them and made subject to the use of the students.

The petition of Edward F. Brown, to be allowed to attend lectures as a student for two years without the payment of fees was presented, endorsed by the Chairman as approved by the Faculty, was considered and on motion it was Resolved that the application be granted and Mr Brown be exempted from payment of any matriculation fee. Provision for the payment of the salary of the secretary of the Faculty having been inadvertently omitted in the appropriations made for salaries of Officers Professors etc. at the July meeting, it is now Resolved that $800 00 be appropriated for the salary of the said Secretary. Resolved, that beginning with the session of 1895-6 the matriculation fee shall be $40.00 for all students liable to the Infirmary fee, and $35.00 for all other students, and that hereafter there shall be no charge for Infirmary or for diplomas. Resolved, that it is inexpedient to consider at this time the request of the members of the Law faculty for an appropriation of $1000. for the purchase of new books for the Law Library. The communication from Profr Peters proposing that the schools of Latin and Greek should each have an assistant and that $1000. be allowed for the two assistants instead of $800., to be divided between the two chairs as might be agreed between Profr Humphreys and himself, was read and on motion considerti of the subject was postponed. Mr McCormick offered the following resolution which was adopted without a dissenting vote: Resolved, that the Visitors now proceed to the election of a successor to the chair made vacant by the death of Professor John B. Minor. After some interchange of views among the members as to the expediency of proceeding with the election at this time, Mr McCormick moved a reconsideration of his resolution and a vote was taken on the motion to reconsider and the Board refused to reconsider by a vote of 5 against to 3 in favor on a call of the roll, as follows: In favor of reconsideration, Messrs McCormick, Watts and Irvine. Against, The Rector, R. W. Martin, McCabe, Patteson and T. S. Martin. The pending question, the election of the law Profr was then called for and ordered. The Rector then announced that nominations to fill the vacant chair in the Law Department was in order. Mr McCormick stated that whilst he would not nominate Mr R. T. Barton of Winchester Va, yet he would cast his vote for him, and addressed the Board forcibly in favor of Mr Barton's qualifications and fitness. Mr T. S. Martin nominated Mr Walter D. Dabney of Albemarle County Va, and urged his election as one most suitable. Mr Irvine nominated Mr Raleigh C. Minor, of the University of Va, assistant to the late Profr Minor, his father, and spoke most earnestly of his qualifications and fitness. No other nominations were made and a call of the roll was ordered and proceeded with and resulted as follows: For Mr Barton - Mr McCormick 1. For Mr Dabney - The Rector, McCabe, Patteson, R. W. Martin &amp; T. S. Martin 5. For Mr Minor - Mr Irvine 1. Mr Watts was present but did not vote. Mr Dabney was declared elected Profr of Common and Statute law for one year.

In this donation it is to be understood and agreed to, that, 1st, only the income of the endowment fund shall be used in the expenses of the said lectureship; 2. A course of lectures, consisting of not less than four or more than six lectures, within the range of the following points, the eternal personality of God, the immortal personality of man, the divine inspiration of the Bible, and the truth of Christianity as revealed in the Bible, shall be, determined at both institutions as often as the income of the endowment fund shall justify; 3. The lectures of each course shall be, as soon after their delivery as practicable, published in book-form, and all the net proceeds of the sale thereof shall be added to the endowment fund of the lectureship, 4. The lecturer in every case shall be chosen by the joint agreement of the Faculties of the two institutions associated in the lectureship, and the lecturer thus chosen shall always be a man of acknowledged scholarship in the department of his lectures, and a member of some branch of the Christian Church holding the evangelical system of historical Christianity. And now I do hereby through you and Prof. N. K. Davis, offer to the Visitors of the University of Virginia the sum of $2500.00 in trust for this purpose, provided that a suitable and satisfactory agreement and arrangement shall be entered into by the legal authorities of the before mentioned institutions for carrying into effect this proposed joint lectureship; and I request you to present this offer to the Visitors of the University of Va at the earliest opportunity, and to request them, if the offer is accepted, to empower and authorize their executive committee to enter into conference with the Executive Committee of the Trustees of Davidson College, and with them to arrange all details pertaining to__ matter, with as little delay as possible. I am, Dear Sir, Yours very sincerely, J. M. P. Otts, Greensboro, Ala.</field>
