      <field name="fulltext">8 January 1953 A special meeting of the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia was held on this date in the Office of the President of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, with the following present: The Rector, Barron F. Black, President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., of the University of Virginia, Visitors Barksdale, Carrington, Coxe, Emmett, Gay, Gravatt, Howard, Mears, Mrs. Smith, Mr. Smith, and Talbott. Absent: Dr. M. L. Combs, President Mary Washington College, Visitors: Wailes and Wheeler. The Board agreed to hear first the representatives of the Student Aid Foundation, Mr. Frank Rogers, Speaker, Mr. Nelson Offutt, Mr. W. M. Camp, and Mr. Coleman Wortham, Jr. Mr. Edwin Meade, representing the Alumni Association, was granted permission to sit in during the presentation by the Student Aid Foundation. Mr. Rogers, speaking for the Foundation, made the following comments The governing board of the Student Aid Foundation endorses the recommendations of the Athletic Committee of the Board of Visitors with the exception of the basis of representation on the control body. Mr. Rogers stated that he first would mention those areas in which all interested parties were in agreement. Areas of Agreement 1. All groups are trying to do what is best for the University. 2. All of us abhor the hypocrisy which has existed in so many institutions concerning football. 3. The University is dependent upon the State of Virginia for support. 4. All of us favor continuing inter-collegiate athletics. 5. Conduct of athletics on 100% simon-pure basis is the ideal. 6. All groups recognize the need of some control of athletics. Areas of Disagreement. 1. The importance of public relations in athletic policy. Football brings the Alumni back to the University and creates a fine relationship. It also serves to attract students, if we have good athletic teams. 2. The feasibility of a 100% simon-pure athletic program. It is essential that we take a realistic viewpoint. If we were to go back to a 100% simon-pure program, things would be worse than when we were a member of the Southern Conference, operating under the Graham plan Alternates: We can either continue on a controlled subsidy basis or drop football entirely. It is our belief that a controlled subsidy basis is far more desirable 3. Where is control of athletics to be vested? It is our belief that it should be vested in the Board of Visitors 4. How is control to be exercised? We do not agree with the Gooch Report. We would like to see the recommendations of the Board of Visitors amended to provide representation from the Student Aid Foundation either by (a) adding two members to be appointed by the President of the Student Aid Foundation, or (b) changing the representatives to three faculty, three alumni, and three students, with the three alumni representatives to be jointly selected by the President of the Alumni Association and the President of the Student Aid Foundation. We desire the representatives of the Student Aid Foundation for two reasons 1. The prestige attached to such representation. It is difficult to get men to serve in a purely money raising organization. 2. Those who provide the money should have some say in how it is spent. I have investigated athletic policies in Virginia, North and South Carolina. Athletics are far better controlled at the University of Virginia than at any other place I have investigated. Selection of Scholarship Holders: The Scholarship Committee of the Student Aid Foundation examines the scholastic and personal background of every prospect the coaches recommend for a scholarship. To protect the athlete from pressure by the coaches, provision is made for an appeal by the scholarship holder to the Scholarship Committee of the Foundation. If the Board of Visitors deems it advisable, we will be glad to deposit our money with the Bursar and have him disburse it. However, we would like the privilege of selecting the boys for these scholarships. The Student Aid Foundation. This organization is three years old and, at this period, $135,000 has been raised. Of this total, 93% has been used for scholarships. To date 59 students have received aid and better than 81% of those helped have received degrees from the University. Last year our total disbursements were about $43,000. Mr. Gay: Can you conceive of a group who would run the Student Aid Foundation who would not be active in the Alumni Association? Answer: No, but giving the Foundation representation would give it some prestige which would help us in raising money. Frankly, we also want a larger vote for the Alumni than that provided in the report of the Athletic Committee of the Board of Visitors. Mr. Black: The University Senate Faculty Report did not recommend the elimination of athletic scholarships, simply the control of them. The Gooch Report was not approved by the Senate nor was it ever submitted to the Board of Visitors. Mr. Coxe: How much money was raised by contributions and how much from concessions? Answer: All Foundation money is raised by contributions. The Alumni Association raises money operating concessions. Mr. Talbott: The Athletic Committee Report of the Board envisions the athletic council as an advisory body with the Director of Athletics recommending action concerning athletic matters to the Board through the President of the University. Do you believe, with such safeguards, that there would be any danger to the program of the Foundation? Answer: Only that the Foundation would like to have support in lower echelons for its program. Mr. Black: Don't you think we can conform with the ACE recommendations without damaging our program? Answer: Yes, I believe we can Mr. Black: Do you consider economic need in making awards? Answer: No, we can't. The boys want the full amount of the scholarship and we have to meet the competition of other schools. The Rector, on behalf of the Board, thanked Mr. Rogers and his associates, whereupon they left the meeting. ALUMNI ASSOCIATION Mr. Edwin Meade, Speaker, Mr. Hunter Faulconer and Mr. Nicholas Wilson, appeared before the Board representing the Alumni Association. Mr. Meade made the following statement. Upon receipt of the communication from the Board and consideration of the reports by the Board of Managers, Mr. Faulconer wrote a letter to each Alumni Chapter, advising them that the Board of Managers was opposed to the recommendations of the Faculty Senate Report and the ACE Report, but endorsed the report of the Athletic Committee of the Board of Visitors, with the-exception of representation on the control body. Mr. Faulconer requested the various chapters for an expression of opinion but only a few have been received - all endorsing the stand of the Board of Managers. Alumni are anxious to contribute toward athletic scholarships and we see no reason why we should not give such scholarships if they are properly controlled. You can not eliminate these scholarships without eliminating football at the University. Report of The University Senate. The Board of Managers is opposed to its plan of organization. With the faculty having a majority vote you would have a packed court. Our program provides for tuition, room, board, and books. Nothing more. We are opposed to the statement in the Faculty Report that athletic scholarships should not exceed the amount given non-athletes. We do not believe we can operate under ACE regulations, but we could under those of the NCAA. We should like to propose the following plan The Board of Managers of the University of Virginia Alumni Association, hereinafter referred to as the "Managers", submits to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, hereinafter referred to as the "Board", the following proposal for the establishment of grants-in-aid to undergraduate students at the University of Virginia 1. Grants to be available only to regularly matriculated students in good standing and to prospective students, but conditioned as to the latter upon their meeting established entrance requirements. 2. The Managers may, from time to time, fix the number and amount of individual grants upon deposit with the Bursar of the University of sufficient funds therefor, provided that in no case shall the amount of a grant exceed University fees and reasonable costs of board, room, laundry, and books, all as determined by the Board. 3. The Bursar shall apply all grants to students to the amounts payable by them to the University, and shall pay the balance of such grants to them in nine (9) equal payments throughout the academic year, provided they maintain their required academic standing. If a student to whom a grant has been awarded is placed on probation or is dismissed from the University, the payments under his grant shall be immediately discontinued. 4. The Managers shall have the right to nominate present and prospective students considered eligible for a grant. If a nominee does not meet established academic or entrance requirements, the Managers shall nominate others who can meet such requirements. No award out of funds or securities provided under this proposal shall be made to a person not nominated by the Managers. 5. The award of a grant under this proposal shall be in the form of a letter written to the nominee by the Bursar informing him that upon his application, approved by the Managers, and his compliance with academic and entrance requirements, he is entitled to a grant in the amount designated, payable in the manner and upon the conditions of this proposal, and his application Dated at Charlottesville, Virginia, this 8th day of January, 1953. BOARD OF MANAGERS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA ALUMNI ASSOCIATION By Hunter Faulconer President Mr. Gay: Is there anything in your plan which commits a man not to accept any other aid? Answer: No, but we can put in such a requirement. Mr. Mears: Wouldn't giving the Foundation representation be a duplication? Answer: Yes, but the Foundation desires the prestige which would be attached to such representation. Judge Smith: If the control body contains three representatives from each group, it could be specified that one of the alumni representatives must also be a trustee of the Student Aid Foundation. Wouldn't this be possible? Answer: Yes Mr. Gay: Why couldn't the Alumni Association select one of its own representatives from the Student Aid Foundation trustees? If this were done, the proposal of the Athletic Committee of the Board could be followed. Mr. Gravatt: What are the outstanding differences between your plan and that of the NCAA? Answer: The NCAA specifies that awards must be made by the regular constituted scholarship committee of the institution. Mr. Black: The NCAA requires consideration of economic need. Would that cause trouble? Answer: No, we consider need in making awards. The Rector thanked the representatives of the Alumni Association, whereupon they left the meeting. STUDENT COUNCIL Mr. John McElroy, President, acted as spokesman and was accompanied by Mr. Waller Horsley, and Mr. Stuart Harris This report is on the subject of athletic control and the subject of athletic practice. On the University of Virginia Senate Resolutions of September 24, 1952, we make these recommendations: 1. That the American Council on Education Report be adopted but with reservations on Articles #1, 5, (A,B,C) 7, and 8. 2. The Joint Committee on Athletics should not be composed of a majority from any one body represented (faculty, alumni, or student) 3. We endorse. 4. (a) and (c) We do not endorse for the following reasons. Scholarship is the primary aim. As long as a student maintains his scholastic requirements, is acceptable under the standards of the University life, he is a desirable student and if any person or group desires to send him on (football) scholarship, he should be allowed to attend the University and he should be allowed to compete in athletics even if his family's financial condition does not require that he be given outside aid. 4. (b) We do not endorse for the following reasons. Successful football teams are generally good for the University. This University should not drop to an easier, smaller school league. This standard of football can only be maintained by bringing athletes here by financial inducements. The financial inducements should be continued to be administered in the same or similar manner in which they are now administered. Due to present policies of Student Aid, we feel that their administration of football scholarship money would result in fewer athletes and poor teams 4. (d) We heartily endorse On the American Council of Education Report we make these suggestions I. We endorse with reservations on the subject of the coaches' salary. In order to have a good coach it may be necessary to pay him a salary in excess of those paid to other full-time faculty members. This suggestion is made without knowledge of either faculty or coaches salaries. II, III, IV. We endorse. V. (A) We do not endorse for reasons stated in 4 (b). V. (B) We do not endorse for the reasons stated in 4 (a). V. (C) We endorse if small expense money is also included to tuition, room, board, etc. V. (D,E,F) We endorse. VI. We endorse. VII. We endorse with reservations on post season tournaments which we feel are not injurious to athletic teams. VIII. (A,B,C) We do not endorse because we do not feel that recruiting athletes is an abuse to the University, the athlete, or to the spirit of athletics. Besides recommendations and suggestions previously made, we feel very strongly on the following 1. All students should be screened by a responsible board of admissions, one capable of withstanding any pressure of alumni or group of alumni. This will insure the type of many worthy of the University. 2. All students should be made to adhere to the scholastic requirements laid down by the faculty. If the suggestions made by this body seem overly lenient, it is only because we feel strongly adverse toward having rules that cannot be enforced and in some cases rules this body does not want enforced. Respectfully submitted /s/ John L. McElroy, Jr. President of Student Council Mr. Gravatt: How do holders of athletic scholarships fit into the life of the University? Answer: They are welcome in fraternities and are active in various student affairs. Mr. Gravatt: Is there any feeling among non-scholarship boys who go out for teams, that they are not being given a fair chance? Answer: (Mr. Harris, member of the football squad): No, I do not believe there has been any discrimination. I had no scholarship when I came here The Rector thanked the representatives of the Student Council, whereupon they left the meeting. As the hour was late, action on this matter was deferred until the next day. - - - - - - - - - - On motion the meeting was then adjourned. Barron F. Black Rector Vincent Shea Secretary</field>
