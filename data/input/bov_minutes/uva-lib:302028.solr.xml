      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia, July 7th, 1906. At an adjourned meeting of the Board of Visitors, held at the University on above date, Present: The Rector, and Visitors Harmon, Hunton, Norton, and Flood, and President Alderman. The Board was called to order at 2:30 o'clock, by the Rector, and on motion, the reading of minutes of the previous meeting was omitted. The President then presented the following correspondence in relation to the retirement of Professor Noah K. Davis,- The Carnegie Foundation For the Advancement of Teaching. June 22, 1906. Dear Professor Davis: I have the pleasure to send you under another cover a copy of the rules for the granting of retiring allowances by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. As the gifts stands at present, institutions like the University of Virginia, which are controlled by the State, are not admitted officially to its benefits, that question being left to be determined at the meeting of the Trustees in November. Meantime, however, at a meeting held yesterday, the Executive Committee decided to invite a few distinguished scholars to accept such retiring allowances as a recognition of unusual and extraordinary service as a scholar. In accordance with this resolution, I have the honor to inform you that the Committee of the Carnegie Foundation invites you to accept a retiring allowance of two thousand dollars ($2,000.) a year, this to begin from July 1, 1906. As you will note by the rules, one-half of this allowance, when granted to a teacher, is paid to his wife should she survive him. In extending to you this invitation to accept a retiring allowance along with a few other well-known American scholars, the Executive Committee wishes me at the same time to assure you of the high esteem in which it holds your scholarly service to the University of Virginia and to the country. I beg that you will inform me whether it will be agreeable to you to accept the retiring allowance, as voted, as an expression of the regard and esteem of the Board of Trustees of the Carnegie Foundation. I am, Very sincerely yours, Henry S. Pritchett, Professor Noah K. Davis, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va. University of Virginia, Academic Department. Charlottesville, Va., June 25, 1906. Dr. Henry S. Pritchett, President, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, 542 Fifth Avenue, New York City. My dear Sir: Your letter of the 22 inst. is duly received. By it I am informed that the Executive Committee of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching invites me to accept a retiring allowance of two thousand dollars ($2000.) a year, to begin from July 1st, 1906, to which is added that one-half of this allowance is granted to my wife should she survive me. At once, without hesitation or demur, I hereby thankfully accept this generous gratuity. I find it impossible to express adequately my sense of the high honor thus conferred, and my gratitude to yourself, to the Committee, and to the Founder of this munificent and philanthropic beneficence in thus providing for the declining years of myself and my wife. Please accept, just now, the simple assurance of my profound gratitude. The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia hold an adjourned meeting on July 7th. On that occasion I shall ask to be retired from my service as a member of the University. The action of the Board will of course be communicated to you. Please notify me of any other prerequisite formalities to be observed. I shall follow your instructions. Allow me to add that the very graceful and gracious terms in which you were pleased to communicate the matter are extremely gratifying to me. With sentiments of the highest esteem, I am, Very respectfully yours, Noah K. Davis Professor of Moral Philosophy University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va. University of Virginia, Academic Department. Charlottesville, Va., July 5th, 1906. Edwin A. Alderman, L. L. D., etc., President of the University of Virginia. Mr. President, Will you please ask the Rector and Visitors of the University at their pending session on the 7th inst., to grant me permission to retire from active service in the University as Professor of Moral Philosophy. After thirty-three years of this service, my increasing age and my physical disabilities render retirement desirable, and I am moved to make the request in order that I may accept the retiring allowance recently voted me by the Trustees of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Will Mr. President kindly explain, as fully as may be desired, to the Rector and Visitors, the particulars of the present situation. Also please express to them my great gratitude for their uniformly generous consideration of my work, and my profound regret that these conditions require a cessation of my former service to the University, which has been for many years my happy home, and to which I have given the best of my life. Very respectfully yours, Noah K. Davis. The Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia acknowledge the receipt of the request for retirement of Professor Noah Knowles Davis with profound regret.

It is a privilege and happiness for the Board to bear testimony to the vigor and skill with which Professor Davis has conducted his courses up to the last moment of his active work, and it desires to extend to him in his well earned retirement the assurance of their admiration, affection and good will.
