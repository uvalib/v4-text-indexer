Mr. Darden said that President Gray favors a shift from special athletic grants to general scholarships, and has proposed a joint meeting with President Hollis Edens of Duke University. Mr. Gravatt commented on the advantages of the N.C.A.A. plan and the hypocrisy of the concealed subsidization that might arise under a system of general scholarships. LEASE TO EQUITABLE REALITY CORPORATION President Darden laid before the Board and recommended approval of a Contract dated 15 September 1955, with attached plat by Henry L. Kinnier, leasing for five years, at fifty dollars ($50.00) a year, to the Equitable Realty Corporation of Charlottesville a triangular strip of land approximately 103 feet in length, lying on the east side of the tract occupied by the Howard D. Johnson Company, to be used for a driveway and for no other purpose, the Contract to be subject to cancellation by the Lessor on thirty (30) days' notice at any time should the tract be needed by the University, otherwise to remain in force from year to year after 15 September 1960 unless notice to the contrary shall be given by either the Lessor or the Lessee sixty (60) days prior to that date or to any annual anniversary of that date The Board resolved that the Comptroller of the University be authorized and directed to execute the proposed Contract as drawn and approved by the University's Attorney and exhibited to the Board STUDENT COUNSELING AND ENROLLMENT President Darden reported increased enrollments in all of the undergraduate schools, a continuing falling off of Virginia students in the School of Law, and an unexpectedly large initial enrollment in the Graduate School of Business Administration. The President and Mr. McWane commented on the work to be done among business men in the State by Mr. Keller. The President reported also on the separation of student counseling in the Engineering School and in the College and the selection of Mr. McKay to assist in this work, the agreement of Professor Mallett to continue as Associate Dean of the Lower Division for one more year to assist Dean Dren, and the choice of Professor B. F. D. Runk to handle student discipline, in conjunction with the Judicial Committee of the Student Council, and to supervise the proposed changed plan of fraternity chaperonage upon the forthcoming resignation of Mr. Fletcher as Director of Student Affairs. The Rector, Mr. Gravatt and others praised the President's choice of Mr. Runk for this work MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE MATTERS GRELLET COLLINS SIMPSON ELECTED PRESIDENT Mr. McWane laid before the Board the following report: Pursuant to its assignment, the Special Committee on the selection of a president for Mary Washington College respectfully submits this report to the Board of Visitors. For the purpose of determining organization and prosedure, our first meeting was held in the Office of President Darden on May 5. After full discussion, the Chairman was empowered to employ such stenographic assistance as he considered necessary and to enlist the services of an executive secretary for conducting and handling the correspondence essential to the completion of our assignment. It was also decided that letters inviting suggestions and nominations should be written to college presidents throughout the South and to the heads of outstanding women's college throughout the nation. Similar letters were sent to the officers of the Alumnae Association and to all faculty members at Mary Washington College, and to faculty members of the University of Virginia. As a result of these letters we received many helpful suggestions and compiled a list of 137 names for consideration. At a meeting on June 21, it was concluded that, inasmuch as the Board of Visitors had determined upon a policy of emphasizing the liberal arts and sciences in the Mary Washington Collete curriculum, all prospects not possessing a background in the liberal arts and sciences should properly be eliminated. Further screening of the list for other reasons reduced our number of prospects to six. It was decided that these prospects should be interviewed individually with sufficient time between interviews for reflection and discussion of each person's qualifications. A schedule of meetings with each prospect was arranged by the Committee in order to provide ample time for full and complete consideration. These meetings started with the first prospect present at an afternoon session on Friday, September 9. They continued with a dinner meeting on Friday evening, breakfast on Saturday morning, a mid-morning and luncheon session, and concluded with the last prospect appearing on Saturday afternoon. President Darden sat with the committee throughout these interviews and participated in the deliberations Following this procedure, I think that it is significant that your Committee found itself in full agreement in its choice of a candidate. We unanimously recommend the election of Dr. Grellet Collins Simpson to be the chief executive of Mary Washington College. Dr. Simpson is a native Virginian, born in Norfolk on April 20, 1909. He is the son of Mrs. Johnne Mabyn Branch Simpson and the late John Calhoun Simpson, a Norfolk businessman. He was married to the former Miss Dorothy Cottrell of Richmond in 1939 He was awarded the Bachelor of Arts degree at Randolph-Macon College in 1930 and, after serving successively on the faculties of Randolph-Macon Academy, Bedford, and Randolph-Macon College, where he taught English and German, he received his Master of Arts degree at the University of Virginia in 1936, following several summers of study at Charlottesville. During the course of his graduate work at the University, he studied under the late Dean John Calvin Metcalf, former Dean James Southall Wilson, and others. He prepared his dissertation under Archibald Hill, now of the University of Texas, on the manuscript versions of The Seven Penitential Psalms, ascribed to the early fifteenth century Thomas Brampton. Dr. Simpson received the Dortor of Philosophy degree from the University of Virginia in 1949. He held the duPont and Bradshaw fellowships during his graduate study. Dr. Simpson was made professor of English at Randolph-Macon College in 1942 and served collaterally as director of counseling from 1946 until 1952, the year he became dean of the faculty. During a four-year leave of absence he served with the American Red Cross and was director of relief to families of Allied personnel in southern Italy. Dr. Simpson is a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Raven Society, Omicron Delta Kappa, the Modern Language Association, and of Phi Delta Theta social fraternity. He is a steward of the Duncan Memorial Methodist Church, Ashland, and is serving his second term as a member of the Ashland Town Council It is the firm conviction of the Committee that he possesses in abundance all of the qualifications requisite to this important position. Respectfully submitted, /s/ Henry E. McWane Henry E. McWane, Chairman Special Committee on the Selection of a President for Mary Washington College September 24, 1955 Following discussion by the Visitors of various candidates considered and praise by the Rector and the President of the work of Mr. McWane and his Committee, the following resolution, moved by Judge Barksdale and duly seconded, was adopted by the Board. RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Report of the Special Committee on the Selection of a President for Mary Washington College as set forth above be and it is hereby approved and adopted, and that it be spread upon the minutes of the Board RESOLVED further that Dr. Grellet Collins Simpson be and he is hereby elected President of Mary Washington College effective 1 February 1956, at an annual salary of $9400.00 in addition to use of the President's House at an estimated valuation of $1200, or a total annual compensation of $10,600.00. ELECTION The Board adopted the following resolution RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. Elmer E. Hoskins be and he is hereby elected as Instructor in psychology at Mary Washington College for the session of 1955-56 at a salary of $3,240. MEETINGS OF THE BOARD The Board resolved that its annual meeting in Fredericksburg should be held on the second Saturday in April, that its Annual meeting in Charlottesville be held on the second Saturday in June, and that additional regular meetings be held in Charlottesville on the second Saturday of October, December, and February. ENROLLMENT AT THE COLLEGE The President commented on present and future dormitory arrangements at the College, and said that enrollment may fall about fifty short of maximum capacity during the present term. -â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â-â- On motion the meeting was then adjourned Barron F.
