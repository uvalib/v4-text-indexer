Drawings of Students in the School of Applied Mathematics I have great pleasure in stating that the health of the students has been good during the session, there having been three or four cases of severe sickness, all of which recovered: that good order and hard studying have characterized the session; and that discipline, under the laws, has been applied in a comparatively small number of instances, and with good effect generally - I am, with great respect, James F. Harrison, M.D. Chairman of the Faculty." On motion of Colo G. T. Barbee, the following resolution was unannmously adopted: Resolved that, whereas it has been communicated to this Board that Dr John Staige Davis, who, for nearly forty years, has been so pleasantly and efficiently associated with the labors of the Faculty of the University of Virginia, is now confined to his room and bed by serious and painful bodily afflication, Attorney-General, Francis S. Blair, a gifted and honored member of this Board, be requested to draft Resolution, expressive of the profound sorrow of this Board at the sad visitation which has befallen Dr Davis and his stricken household; and that a copy of said resolutions shall be spread upon the minutes of this Board; and that our Secretary be requested to furnish a Copy of the same to the sorrowing family of our esteemed Professor. Whereupon, the Hon Francis S. Blair submitted the following preamble and resolution, which were unanimously adopted: "The Board of Visitors, having this day received through Dr James L. Cabell, his medical attendant, written information of the severe illness of Dr John Staige Davis, Professor of Anatomy, and requesting for him a leave of absence for the ensuing session, 1885-6, for the purpose of a recuperation of his health, with the proposition that Dr David provide a suitable and competent substitute, during the specified time: And the Board having considered the said application, and the present condition of Dr Davis, deem it but due to him to say that, inasmuch as during a period of nearly forty years, he has served the University with fidelity and ability, and by his discipline and learning has thus, not only given a most valuable contribution to its success, fame and efficiency, but has adorned with splendid genius the Chair he has so honorably filled, they take pleasure in acceding to the request for said leave of absence; and, in doing so, they beg leave to express their earnest wish that rest and medical treatment may restore him to his usual physical and mental strength, and that he may be thus returned to his former sphere of usefulness for the accomplishment of further educational good. Without intended obtrusion on the sacred grief of the household of DrDavis, we deem it not unfit, hereby, to express our sincere sorrow at his present sad affliction, and to testify our profound sympathy for them in this, their hour of domestic suffering To estimate the benefactions bestowed on mankind by Dr Davis, during his long and professional services, it is only necessary to consider the multitude of young men who have gone forth from his lecture room into the field of the world to sow those choice seeds of learning that under the inspiration of his wise instructions have ripened into a full fruition of most valuable citizenship and deserving manhood; and whether it shall please Almighty God, in his infinite mercy, to restore him to health, or in his providence to terminate his career on earth, it will be to his family and friends a source of affectionate satisfaction that his career has been rounded off by the virtues of a well spent life, and that he has deserved well of his fellow men. Therefore be it resolved that Dr John Staige Davis, Professor of Anatomy in the University of Virginia, be granted a leave of absence during the ensuing session, 1885-86, with the proviso, as proposed by himself, that he procure Dr William B. Towles, or some other suitable and competent substitute substitute during his said absence. The Faculty and other Reports, named in the Chairman's Report, were referred to the appropriate Committees for report on the same. Adjourned till tomorrow morning. W. Roane Ruffin Tuesday, June 30, 1885.

Resolved that the Faculty be empowered to modify, in its discretion, all fines and charges for not returning books to the Library in due time, so that the aggregate of said fines and charges for failure to return any book, shall in no case be less than one and a half times the sum required to replace the said book or books, in respect to which the default may occur.

Resolved that no expenditure of money relating to the Observatory shall be chargeable to the general funds of the University, save and except in making improvements upon the road leading to the said Observatory, whereby the same may be made more easily accessible to the general visitor; and with a view to making such improvements upon the said road a sum of money not exceeding $100 is hereby appropriated for that purpose: Provided, however, that the same is to be paid out of any surplus in the treasury, next session, not otherwise appropriated.
