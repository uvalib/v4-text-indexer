      <field name="fulltext">TENTATIVE MINUTES SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE BOARD OF VISITORS January 25-26, 2002 The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met, in Open Session, at 8:30 a.m., Friday, January 25, 2002, in the Board Room of the Rotunda; John P. Ackerly, III, Rector, presided. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr., Charles M. Caravati, Jr., M.D., William G. Crutchfield, Jr., Thomas F. Farrell, II, Charles L. Glazer, William H. Goodwin, Jr., T. Keister Greer, Gordon F. Rainey, Jr., Timothy B. Robertson, Terence P. Ross, Thomas A. Saunders, III, Ms. Elizabeth A. Twohy, Benjamin P.A. Warthen, and Ms. Sasha L. Wilson were present. Also present were John T. Casteen, III, Leonard W. Sandridge, Alexander G. Gilliam, Jr., Paul J. Forch, Gene D. Block, Ms. Colette Sheehy, Robert E. Reynolds, M.D., Ms. Yoke San Reynolds, R. Ariel Gomez, M.D., William W. Harmon, and Ms. Jeanne Flippo Bailes. The Rector welcomed Mr. R. Edward Howell, who will assume his duties as Chief Executive Officer of the Medical Center in February. Mr. Howell attended most sessions of the Board meeting as well as meetings of Board committees. On motion, the Minutes of the meeting of the Board of Visitors of October 18-19, 2001, were approved. The President gave his customary report, the greater part of which was given over to an account of the state budget as it affects the University. There have been significant budget cuts announced by the Governor. Some of these had been anticipated by the University but others are more serious than had been expected. Arts &amp; Sciences is more vulnerable than most areas of the University to cuts of this sort. Of particular concern, however, is the state's failure to grant salary raises to faculty and staff for the second straight year. The faculty are dropping yet further behind their peer group and the cost of living in Charlottesville, which is among the highest in the state, is having a substantial impact on faculty and staff. The President expressed grave concern about two proposals under discussion in the General Assembly which would cap out-of-state enrollment at the University. He explained why measures of this sort are bad policy for the University as well as for higher education in general in Virginia. He reported as well on the Governor's proposal to revert to the state revenue generated by the small increase in tuition that would be allowed by this proposal, which the President characterized as a tax on college students and their parents. Mr. Sandridge then gave a brief report on emergency planning at the University in light of the events of September 11th, 2001. The President resumed with his customary report on gifts and grants, noting particularly a gift of $3.9million from Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin to the Health System for the Human Immune Therapy Center, as well as $560,000 given by the John M. Olin Foundation to the Law School. By resolution, the Board accepted the report on gifts and grants. The President concluded his remarks by noting that University employees gave more than $550,000 to the Combined Virginia Campaign, which was the highest amount raised by any state agency. He then offered condolences to the Appalachian School of Law and to the Vice Chair of its board, Mr. Wolfe, on the recent tragedy at the School. --------- The Board recessed at 9:05 a.m. to begin Committee meetings. --------- The Board resumed its meeting as the full Board, in Open Session, at 2:05 p.m.; all Members present at the earlier meeting, along with Mr. Wolfe, were present.
