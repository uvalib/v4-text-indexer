RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that Dr. Everett Cato Drash be and is hereby elected Instructor in Surgery and Gynecology, at a salary of $3,500, incumbency beginning January 1, 1931. In the matter of George Zinn to the University of the sum, under his will, of $50,000, Mr. Allan Perkins, attorney for the University, presented to the Board a written statement of the situation which has arisen under the will whereby the amount to be received in full payment of said bequest is reduced to $18,000. The settlement was approved, and the full report is shown below: Report of W. Allan Perkins, Attorney, to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, upon the subject of bequest under the will of George Zinn, deceased. Gentlemen: The 17th clause of the Will of George Zinn, deceased, of Rydal, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, reads as follows: "17. To the Trustees of the University of Virginia, I give the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars, ($50,000.00), to be known as the "CAPTAIN GEORGE ZINN AVIATION FUND", or some similar description as they may deem proper to perpetuate my name, the income of which shall be used in the discretion of the said trustees for the promotion and fostering of aviation." I am advised that Mr. Zinn died during the early part of the year 1929 and his will was duly offered for probate in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, by the Equitable Trust Company of Wilmington, Delaware, and Wm. R. Scharton, of Reading, Massachusetts, Executors named in said will. I am also advised that when said will was so offered for probate a caveat against the probate thereof was filed by Mrs. Flora M. Zinn, his widow, no provision having been made in said will for said widow. Our attention was first called to this matter through a letter from Wm. R. Scharton addressed to the Trustees of the University of Virginia, under date of July 30th, 1929. This letter was referred to me on July 31st, 1929, by Mr. Newcomb, and I immediately made an investigation which resulted in the employment of Messrs. Larzelere &amp; Wright, attorneys of Norristown, Pennsylvania, to represent the interests of the University under this will. A number of letters passed between these attorneys and myself, with the result that in the early part of December, last, it was decided that the situation, which had developed, was of sufficient importance to require personal attention and therefore Mr. Newcomb and I went first to Wilmington, Delaware, where we conferred with representatives of the Annie Rogers duPont interests (Mr. Zinn having been a son of Mrs. Annie Rogers duPont) and after obtaining such information as we needed from this source, we proceeded to Norristown where we had a conference with Mr. Larzalere and with Mr. Wright, going over the whole situation with these gentlemen. From their office we went to the office of Messrs. Ballard, Spahr, Andrews and Ingersoll, of Philadelphia, where we conferred with Mr. Ingersoll, who is the attorney for Mrs. Flora M. Zinn. The information which we have been able to gather from correspondence and from our personal interviews is as follows: First. It is practically certain that should litigation with reference to the probate of the will be allowed to continue the will will be set aside and Mr. Zinn will thereupon become intestate. In this event the University will, of course, be entitled to no part of his estate. Second. Mrs. Flora M. Zinn, it seems, has the entire sympathy of certain of the duPont interests and on this account an offer has been made by these interests to make settlement with the different legatees named under the will, by paying certain amounts in cash which are to be received by the different legatees in full payment of their respective legacies. Third. In order to pay all of Mr. Zinn's debts and the legacies under his will this estate would have to consist of something over $600,000.00. As a matter of fact the actual value of the estate does not exceed $235,000.00. The result is that if the will were sustained all legacies would have to be reduced to about thirty-six per cent of their actual amounts. This would mean that if the will were sustained the University would receive about $18,000.00 under this will. Fourth. Mrs. Zinn now proposes to pay the University this $18,000.00 in cash provided the University will assign to her all of its rights under said will. Similar assignments are to be made by the other legatees under the will and Wm. R. Scharton, chief legatee under the will and the largest single creditor agrees that if this is done he will waive payment of debts and legacies amounting in the aggregate to about $110,000. It is this agreement on Mr. Scharton's part that makes it worth while for Mrs. Zinn to take the assignments of different legacies. Fifth. The conclusion which we have reached upon this subject is that should we insist upon undertaking to uphold the will in the face of Mrs. Zinn's caveat, we will not only be put to large expense in the matter of attorneys' fees and cost of litigation but should we actually succeed in sustaining the will, which is doubtful in the extreme, we could not hope to receive more than the $18,000.00 which Mrs. Zinn now offers to us without litigation. It will thus be seen that there is no possible argument in favor of declining Mrs. Zinn's offer. We, therefore, unhesitatingly recommend that it be accepted and that proper resolution be adopted directing the Rector to execute the necessary assignments to Mrs. Zinn. Respectfully submitted, W. Allan Perkins. In connection with the bequest from the estate of Franklin Stringfellow Hall, listed in the gifts, a contract was entered into whereby the University will pay to his widow the sum of 5% on the amount of the bequest during her lifetime, after which the fund becomes an endowment for scholarships. CONTRACT By his will, which was admitted to probate in the Clerk's Office for the Circuit Court of Culpeper County, Virginia, on the 14th day of January, 1905, and recorded in said Office in W. B. 3, p. 191, Franklin Stringfellow Hall, after giving to his wife, Mrs. Bessie Hall, the sum of $400.00 absolutely, and providing for payments of his debts and for the erection of a suitable monument over his grave, leaves all the rest and residue of his said estate, both real and personal, to his said wife for life, with remainder to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, upon trust that the corpus of said Estate shall be held by said University forever, and that the income from the same shall be applied for the establishment of a scholarship for poor young men who are natives and residents of Virginia. He gives to his wife the "undisturbed possession and control" of his entire estate during her life, and the right to use and enjoy the income therefrom, requiring no security of her and giving her full power to change investments and to sell and convey real estate, and said will directs that no inventory or appraisment of said estate should be made, but directs that as soon as practicable after his death his said wife should furnish said University with an accurate and detailed statement of said estate, and the value of the same, and that she should keep said University advised of any change of investment she might make from time to time. At the time of his death, the estate of said Franklin Stringfellow Hall had a gross value of approximately $9000.00. At the present time said estate has a gross value of $9250.00, and the said Mrs. Bessie Hall desires to be relieved of the further responsibility of the management of said estate, and wishes to turn the full principal amount thereof over to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, upon agreement by said University to pay to her, during the remainder of her life, an annuity at a sum not exceeding 5% per annum upon the principal fund, and in accordance with the provisions of Acts of 1916, page 491, by which Act said University is authorized to enter into a contract of this character. NOW, THEREFORE, THIS CONTRACT made this 14th day of February, 1931, by and between the said Mrs. Bessie Hall, of the first part, and The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, of the second part, WITNESSETH: That in consideration of the premises, the said Mrs. Bessie Hall doth hereby transfer, assign, set over and deliver unto said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia the principal sum of $9250.00. And in consideration of the delivery to it by said Mrs. Bessie Hall of said $9250.00 above referred to, said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, acting pursuant to authority vested in it by an Act of the Legislature of Virginia, approved March 16th, 1916 (see Acts of 1916, p. 491), doth hereby agree and bind itself to pay to the said Mrs. Bessie Hall an annuity during the whole of the remainder of the life of said Mrs. Bessie Hall, which said annuity shall not exceed 5% per annum upon said principal amount of $9250.00, and said annuity to be payable to said Mrs. Bessie Hall in semi-annual or quarterly installments, as she may direct; it being understood, of course, that upon the death of said Mrs. Bessie Hall said principal fund, together with any income which may have accrued between the date of the last payment of any installment of such annuity and the date of death of said Mrs. Bessie Hall, shall then pass to said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, absolutely and completely, in accordance with the terms of the will of said Franklin Stringfellow Hall hereinbefore referred to. And said Mrs. Bessie Hall hereby certifies that she is at the present time eighty-three (83) years of age, and that said fund of $9250.00 represents the whole of the estate of the said Franklin Stringfellow Hall now in her hands. WITNESS the following signatures and seals: (Signed) Bessie Hall(SEAL) THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, By Fred W. Scott, Rector. Attest: E. I. Carruthers, Secretary. A contract was entered into between the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Company and the Rector and Visitors with respect to the erection of a coal hopper under the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio trestle. CONTRACT MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT, Made and entered into this 30th day of March 1931, by and between The Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Company, party of the first part, and the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, party of the second part, both being corporations under the laws of the State of Virginia: WHEREAS the party of the first part owns a certain coal trestle and the tracks thereon, situated west of Bridge No. 1826, south of and near to the right of way of its Mountain Sub-Division at Charlottesville, Virginia, which trestle, standing on the land of the party of the second part is by mutual agreement jointly maintained by the parties hereto and is used in delivering fuel to the party of the second part for its power house and other purposes; and the party of the second part now wishes to install under said trestle a coal hopper and conveyor substantially of the design and as shown in blue print of Drawing No. 91-30 attached hereto and made a part hereof, with and pursuant to the permission hereinafter given of the party of the first part: NOW, THEREFORE, THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH: 1. That the party of the first part licenses the party of the second part to construct and maintain a coal hopper, and conveyor in connection therewith, under its said coal trestle, substantially as shown on blue print of Drawing No. 91-30, which hopper is to be constructed of one-fourth inch steel plate with necessary beams, posts, stiffeners and braces to support the same, free from any bearing on the bents of the coal trestle, and which screw conveyor and its covering also are to be of metal construction and no part of its support is to bear on the bents of said trestle. The top of the hopper may abut against bents, in order to avoid waste while unloading coal. 2. That the party of the second part may use said hopper and screw conveyor, when completed, for the purpose of unloading and conveying to its power house its coal from cars on said trestle. 3.

Formal contract was entered into between the Virginia Education Association and the University, with respect to the operation of the Preventorium for Virginia Teachers, embodying resolutions formerly adopted by the two contracting parties concerning said Preventorium, in the following resolution, adopted: RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That the contract with the Virginia Education Association with respect to the operation of the Preventorium for Virginia Teachers be and is hereby approved, and that the Rector be and is hereby authorized to sign, and the Secretary to attest the same, on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. CONTRACT WHEREAS the Virginia Education Association is composed chiefly of teachers and officers of the Public Free Schools of Virginia, some of whom from time to time require hospital attention and services, and who desire to obtain and use the same in connection with the Hospital of the University of Virginia, at Charlottesville, Virginia, upon terms and conditions mutually satisfactory to the University of Virginia and to this Association; and WHEREAS certain terms and conditions have been agreed upon by said Association and by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia; NOW, THEREFORE, THIS CONTRACT made this 13th day of June, 1927, by and between said Virginia Education Association, hereinafter called Association, of the first part, and The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, hereinafter called University, of the second part, WITNESSETH: 1st. Said Association hereby agree to pay to said University the sum of $40,000.00, for the purpose of providing and maintaining a Preventorium or hospital service and attention required by the members of said Association from time to time, and to that end the said University shall set apart and use, so far as may be necessary or desirable, for that purpose the whole of a floor of the south wing of the new hospital building in essential conformity with the plans submitted by Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch &amp; Abbott, the same to be known as the Ennion G. Williams Preventorium. 2nd. That space for twenty patients with the necessary bath and service room facilities shall be provided and shall, in all respects, be in keeping with the present hospital; and that the University shall maintain and control the said rooms as a Preventorium or teachers' pavilion, in exactly the same manner as it maintains the regular University Hospital. It is understood that if it be found that $40,000.00 will not be sufficient for the purposes named, further negotiations will be entered into by the parties concerned before construction shall be begun. And if $40,000.00 should be more than the amount required for said purposes the excess shall be used so far as necessary to furnish the said Preventorium, after which any unexpended balance shall revert to the Virginia Education Association. 3rd. That the professional services which shall be rendered shall include such examinations and treatment as is provided at the regular University Hospital, and shall also include any additional service or treatment of any kind or nature which may hereafter be established and maintained as a part of the hospital facilities of the University. Such services shall include all examinations, diagnoses, laboratory tests, X-ray examinations, prescriptions, operations, board, room service, ordinary nursing attention and any other services of any kind or nature which may be rendered as a part of the regular University Hospital. 4th. That the professional services offered and rendered to the patients assigned pursuant hereto shall be made by the regular physicians and surgeons who ordinarily perform such services or operations in the regular University Hospital and are given to pay patients. A charge of $4.00 per day shall be made for each teacher entering hereunder for each day confined in said Hospital, or using the Preventorium. A minimum for any teacher shall be $15.00, even if the charge of $4.00 per day shall not be equal to that sum. Should, at any time after one years expiration, the cost of service to occupants of the Preventorium be more or less on the average than $4.00 per day, then the University shall fix the per diem charges so as to conform with such costs. 5th. That this Association and the teachers entering the Preventorium, or pavilion, in pursuance hereof, shall be under no expense for any equipment, repairs, maintenance, janitor's service or any expense of any kind in connection with the operation of such Preventorium, or pavilion. No patient shall be admitted by the University to the facilities provided for under these resolutions except through the approval and certification for admission by this Association acting through its executive committee, or other proper committee regularly assigned for that purpose. It is understood, however, that no certification for admission shall be given except to members of the Virginia Education Association. All occupants of the proposed Preventorium shall be subject to the same rules and regulations that apply to the regular patients of the University of Virginia Hospital. The properly authorized administrative officers of the University Hospital reserve the right to decide upon the medical suitability of applicants for admission and the proper time of discharge of patients from the Preventorium. If any rooms so set apart as a Preventorium are not needed for the purposes of the Association then the University may for such time use them for general hospital purposes. 6th. The terms and conditions set out in this contract shall continue in force for one year from the date hereof, and shall thereafter continue from year to year unless changed by said Association and said University, acting through their regularly constituted authorities.

Scott defining the terms of his proposed gift to the University for the erection of an Athletic Stadium was read, and the following resolution, adopted, (The Rector did not vote). RESOLVED, That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia express to Frederic W. Scott, Esq., the grateful appreciation of his proposal to make to the University gifts in the amount of $60,000 each in each year 1930 to 1934, inclusive. That the amount or proceeds of said gifts be applied to the erection of an Athletic Stadium and the proper officers of the University are authorized to carry the same as made and received in each year to the Stadium Fund. December 26, 1930. Dr. E. A. Alderman, President The University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia. My dear Dr. Alderman: It is my desire to get into definite shape the matter of certain gifts or donations which I have contemplated making to the University of Virginia. With this object in view I now desire to advise you that I have determined to give or donate to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia the sum of $60,000 during each of the years 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933 and 1934, said respective gifts, each for the sum stated, to be made on or before the 31st day of December in each year. I shall make each of these gifts in whole or in part either in cash or in readily marketable securities having a net market value equal to the respective sums named on the date that said gift is made and the cash and securities delivered. I also reserve the right to anticipate said gifts, or any of them, by increasing the amount given in any year. It is not my intention to make a present gift of the aggregate of the sums named, but that said respective gifts shall be considered as being made only as and on the dates that the cash or securities to the amount or of the net value stated shall actually be delivered in each year. I am gratified that the Board of Visitors has determined to apply these gifts to the erection of an Athletic Stadium for the University. The first of these gifts for the year 1930 will be made, and the cash or securities in the amount or to the value of $60,000 will be delivered, prior to the 31st of the month. Sincerely yours, (Signed) Fred W. Scott The Board held a meeting at the Medical Building where the bids were received for the Clark Memorial Law Building to be erected by the gift of Wm. A. Clark, Jr. Some twenty bids were submitted, the lowest being that of the Johnson Construction Company of Norfolk, Va., for $271,567.00, and the contract was accordingly awarded them. The meeting then adjourned. C. Harding Walker Secretary. E. I. Carruthers Rector.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Report of W. Allan Perkins, Attorney, to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, upon the subject of bequest under the will of George Zinn, deceased. Gentlemen: The 17th clause of the Will of George Zinn, deceased, of Rydal, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, reads as follows: "17. To the Trustees of the University of Virginia, I give the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars, ($50,000.00), to be known as the "CAPTAIN GEORGE ZINN AVIATION FUND", or some similar description as they may deem proper to perpetuate my name, the income of which shall be used in the discretion of the said trustees for the promotion and fostering of aviation." I am advised that Mr. Zinn died during the early part of the year 1929 and his will was duly offered for probate in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, by the Equitable Trust Company of Wilmington, Delaware, and Wm. R. Scharton, of Reading, Massachusetts, Executors named in said will. I am also advised that when said will was so offered for probate a caveat against the probate thereof was filed by Mrs. Flora M. Zinn, his widow, no provision having been made in said will for said widow. Our attention was first called to this matter through a letter from Wm. R. Scharton addressed to the Trustees of the University of Virginia, under date of July 30th, 1929. This letter was referred to me on July 31st, 1929, by Mr. Newcomb, and I immediately made an investigation which resulted in the employment of Messrs. Larzelere &amp; Wright, attorneys of Norristown, Pennsylvania, to represent the interests of the University under this will. A number of letters passed between these attorneys and myself, with the result that in the early part of December, last, it was decided that the situation, which had developed, was of sufficient importance to require personal attention and therefore Mr. Newcomb and I went first to Wilmington, Delaware, where we conferred with representatives of the Annie Rogers duPont interests (Mr. Zinn having been a son of Mrs. Annie Rogers duPont) and after obtaining such information as we needed from this source, we proceeded to Norristown where we had a conference with Mr. Larzalere and with Mr. Wright, going over the whole situation with these gentlemen. From their office we went to the office of Messrs. Ballard, Spahr, Andrews and Ingersoll, of Philadelphia, where we conferred with Mr. Ingersoll, who is the attorney for Mrs. Flora M. Zinn. The information which we have been able to gather from correspondence and from our personal interviews is as follows: First. It is practically certain that should litigation with reference to the probate of the will be allowed to continue the will will be set aside and Mr. Zinn will thereupon become intestate. In this event the University will, of course, be entitled to no part of his estate. Second. Mrs. Flora M. Zinn, it seems, has the entire sympathy of certain of the duPont interests and on this account an offer has been made by these interests to make settlement with the different legatees named under the will, by paying certain amounts in cash which are to be received by the different legatees in full payment of their respective legacies. Third. In order to pay all of Mr. Zinn's debts and the legacies under his will this estate would have to consist of something over $600,000.00. As a matter of fact the actual value of the estate does not exceed $235,000.00. The result is that if the will were sustained all legacies would have to be reduced to about thirty-six per cent of their actual amounts. This would mean that if the will were sustained the University would receive about $18,000.00 under this will. Fourth. Mrs. Zinn now proposes to pay the University this $18,000.00 in cash provided the University will assign to her all of its rights under said will. Similar assignments are to be made by the other legatees under the will and Wm. R. Scharton, chief legatee under the will and the largest single creditor agrees that if this is done he will waive payment of debts and legacies amounting in the aggregate to about $110,000. It is this agreement on Mr. Scharton's part that makes it worth while for Mrs. Zinn to take the assignments of different legacies. Fifth. The conclusion which we have reached upon this subject is that should we insist upon undertaking to uphold the will in the face of Mrs. Zinn's caveat, we will not only be put to large expense in the matter of attorneys' fees and cost of litigation but should we actually succeed in sustaining the will, which is doubtful in the extreme, we could not hope to receive more than the $18,000.00 which Mrs. Zinn now offers to us without litigation. It will thus be seen that there is no possible argument in favor of declining Mrs. Zinn's offer. We, therefore, unhesitatingly recommend that it be accepted and that proper resolution be adopted directing the Rector to execute the necessary assignments to Mrs. Zinn. Respectfully submitted, W. Allan Perkins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CONTRACT By his will, which was admitted to probate in the Clerk's Office for the Circuit Court of Culpeper County, Virginia, on the 14th day of January, 1905, and recorded in said Office in W.

NOW, THEREFORE, THIS CONTRACT made this 14th day of February, 1931, by and between the said Mrs. Bessie Hall, of the first part, and The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, of the second part, WITNESSETH: That in consideration of the premises, the said Mrs. Bessie Hall doth hereby transfer, assign, set over and deliver unto said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia the principal sum of $9250.00. And in consideration of the delivery to it by said Mrs. Bessie Hall of said $9250.00 above referred to, said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, acting pursuant to authority vested in it by an Act of the Legislature of Virginia, approved March 16th, 1916 (see Acts of 1916, p. 491), doth hereby agree and bind itself to pay to the said Mrs. Bessie Hall an annuity during the whole of the remainder of the life of said Mrs. Bessie Hall, which said annuity shall not exceed 5% per annum upon said principal amount of $9250.00, and said annuity to be payable to said Mrs. Bessie Hall in semi-annual or quarterly installments, as she may direct; it being understood, of course, that upon the death of said Mrs. Bessie Hall said principal fund, together with any income which may have accrued between the date of the last payment of any installment of such annuity and the date of death of said Mrs. Bessie Hall, shall then pass to said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, absolutely and completely, in accordance with the terms of the will of said Franklin Stringfellow Hall hereinbefore referred to. And said Mrs. Bessie Hall hereby certifies that she is at the present time eighty-three (83) years of age, and that said fund of $9250.00 represents the whole of the estate of the said Franklin Stringfellow Hall now in her hands.

      <field name="fulltext">CONTRACT WHEREAS the Virginia Education Association is composed chiefly of teachers and officers of the Public Free Schools of Virginia, some of whom from time to time require hospital attention and services, and who desire to obtain and use the same in connection with the Hospital of the University of Virginia, at Charlottesville, Virginia, upon terms and conditions mutually satisfactory to the University of Virginia and to this Association; and WHEREAS certain terms and conditions have been agreed upon by said Association and by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia; NOW, THEREFORE, THIS CONTRACT made this 13th day of June, 1927, by and between said Virginia Education Association, hereinafter called Association, of the first part, and The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, hereinafter called University, of the second part, WITNESSETH: 1st. Said Association hereby agree to pay to said University the sum of $40,000.00, for the purpose of providing and maintaining a Preventorium or hospital service and attention required by the members of said Association from time to time, and to that end the said University shall set apart and use, so far as may be necessary or desirable, for that purpose the whole of a floor of the south wing of the new hospital building in essential conformity with the plans submitted by Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch &amp; Abbott, the same to be known as the Ennion G. Williams Preventorium. 2nd. That space for twenty patients with the necessary bath and service room facilities shall be provided and shall, in all respects, be in keeping with the present hospital; and that the University shall maintain and control the said rooms as a Preventorium or teachers' pavilion, in exactly the same manner as it maintains the regular University Hospital. It is understood that if it be found that $40,000.00 will not be sufficient for the purposes named, further negotiations will be entered into by the parties concerned before construction shall be begun. And if $40,000.00 should be more than the amount required for said purposes the excess shall be used so far as necessary to furnish the said Preventorium, after which any unexpended balance shall revert to the Virginia Education Association. 3rd. That the professional services which shall be rendered shall include such examinations and treatment as is provided at the regular University Hospital, and shall also include any additional service or treatment of any kind or nature which may hereafter be established and maintained as a part of the hospital facilities of the University. Such services shall include all examinations, diagnoses, laboratory tests, X-ray examinations, prescriptions, operations, board, room service, ordinary nursing attention and any other services of any kind or nature which may be rendered as a part of the regular University Hospital. 4th. That the professional services offered and rendered to the patients assigned pursuant hereto shall be made by the regular physicians and surgeons who ordinarily perform such services or operations in the regular University Hospital and are given to pay patients. A charge of $4.00 per day shall be made for each teacher entering hereunder for each day confined in said Hospital, or using the Preventorium. A minimum for any teacher shall be $15.00, even if the charge of $4.00 per day shall not be equal to that sum. Should, at any time after one years expiration, the cost of service to occupants of the Preventorium be more or less on the average than $4.00 per day, then the University shall fix the per diem charges so as to conform with such costs. 5th. That this Association and the teachers entering the Preventorium, or pavilion, in pursuance hereof, shall be under no expense for any equipment, repairs, maintenance, janitor's service or any expense of any kind in connection with the operation of such Preventorium, or pavilion. No patient shall be admitted by the University to the facilities provided for under these resolutions except through the approval and certification for admission by this Association acting through its executive committee, or other proper committee regularly assigned for that purpose. It is understood, however, that no certification for admission shall be given except to members of the Virginia Education Association. All occupants of the proposed Preventorium shall be subject to the same rules and regulations that apply to the regular patients of the University of Virginia Hospital. The properly authorized administrative officers of the University Hospital reserve the right to decide upon the medical suitability of applicants for admission and the proper time of discharge of patients from the Preventorium. If any rooms so set apart as a Preventorium are not needed for the purposes of the Association then the University may for such time use them for general hospital purposes. 6th. The terms and conditions set out in this contract shall continue in force for one year from the date hereof, and shall thereafter continue from year to year unless changed by said Association and said University, acting through their regularly constituted authorities. IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF said Virginia Education Association has caused this contract to be signed by H. L. Sulfridge, its President, and the said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia has caused its name to be signed hereto by Frederic W.

      <field name="fulltext">December 26, 1930. Dr. E. A. Alderman, President The University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia. My dear Dr. Alderman: It is my desire to get into definite shape the matter of certain gifts or donations which I have contemplated making to the University of Virginia. With this object in view I now desire to advise you that I have determined to give or donate to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia the sum of $60,000 during each of the years 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933 and 1934, said respective gifts, each for the sum stated, to be made on or before the 31st day of December in each year. I shall make each of these gifts in whole or in part either in cash or in readily marketable securities having a net market value equal to the respective sums named on the date that said gift is made and the cash and securities delivered. I also reserve the right to anticipate said gifts, or any of them, by increasing the amount given in any year. It is not my intention to make a present gift of the aggregate of the sums named, but that said respective gifts shall be considered as being made only as and on the dates that the cash or securities to the amount or of the net value stated shall actually be delivered in each year. I am gratified that the Board of Visitors has determined to apply these gifts to the erection of an Athletic Stadium for the University. The first of these gifts for the year 1930 will be made, and the cash or securities in the amount or to the value of $60,000 will be delivered, prior to the 31st of the month. Sincerely yours, (Signed) Fred W. Scott</field>
