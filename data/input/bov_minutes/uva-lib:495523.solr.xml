      <field name="fulltext">STATEMENT BY THE RECTOR Report of the Special Committee on the Nomination of A President By Fred G. Pollard, Rector University of Virginia January 24, 1985 For only the sixth time in the University of Virginia's long and distinguished history, the Board of Visitors meets today to receive the nomination of a new President. The election of a President is the single most important action that this body can take, and our decision today will introduce a new era-for this great institution — as has been the case with the election of each of the previous Presidents since 1904. On March 16, 1984, Frank L. Hereford Jr., advised the Board that he wished to relinquish the Office of President by the end of his eleventh year, the Summer of 1985. He has served the University with such distinction and dedication that the Board could do no less than honor his request. As prescribed by the Manual of the Board of Visitors, I appointed a Special Committee on the Nomination of a President. At the same time, the Faculty Senate and the Student Council were asked to form committees to make nominations to the Special Committee. The Committee also sought nominations from the Alumni and others. I cannot say enough about the quality of the work carried out by the students and the faculty. Their deliberations and insight were of great value to the Board's Special Committee and the caliber of the nominees that they submitted was outstanding. In all, 312 nominations were received. The faculty submitted 17 names as being qualified and the students submitted 28 names. Ten of those on the students' list were also on the faculty list. The man we recommend was high on both lists. I would be remiss not to thank the members of the Search Committee for their untiring efforts. We met on ten occasions and in addition we studied hundreds of pages of reports. I think their reward is that we all feel that we have found the best possible man for the University. The Committee sought most to find a person who could build on the tremendous momentum provided by Frank Hereford's leadership. During this period the University has made enormous strides academically. We have just completed the most successful three-year fund drive of any publicly supported institution of higher learning. Our new $225 million hospital is funded and ready for construction. We have become competitive in intercollegiate athletics. The students who come here are unmatched. We enjoy a strong relationship with the executive and legislative branches of the Commonwealth. In short, the momentum generated by Frank Hereford has made it possible for any qualified Virginian to attend a nationally-recognized university without having to leave the Commonwealth. We believe we have found the man to accelerate that momentum -to lead the University to new heights during its next era. He is Robert Marchant O'Neil. A distinguished scholar and writer by any measure, he is President of the University of Wisconsin system and one of its law professors. The Wisconsin system has an annual budget of $1.3 billion. Impressive as that may sound, the Special Committee was even more persuaded by Mr. O'Neil's commitment to values that have long been identified with the University of Virginia, such as the importance of the liberal arts in the education of all men and women. He is an excellent classroom teacher and has written extensively on contemporary issues—particularly on the First Amendment. He has gained important experience at the university level as chief academic and administrative officer at Indiana University's Bloomington campus and as vice president and provost for academic affairs at the University of Cincinnati. He received his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in American History from Harvard University and his law degree from Harvard in 1961. Mr. O'Neil is well known for his skills in working on behalf of higher education at the state and federal legislative levels. He is an able fund raiser. He is highly regarded in national higher education circles, serving on the boards of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, the Council on Post-Secondary Accreditation, the Educational Testing Service and the Johnson Foundation. He chairs the Financial Resource Development Committee of the Center for Research Libraries and the Legal Affairs Committee of the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges. The Committee recognized, also, that Mr. O'Neil's wife, Karen, would be a special asset to the University family as would their four children. Mrs. O'Neil, a Vassar graduate, is a gracious hostess, and is a scholar in her own right. She was co-author with her husband of a book, Civil Liberties: Case Studies and the Law. Wherever our committee turned its search these last ten months, Robert O'Neil's name came forward. Leaders in higher learning throughout the country told us, "Bob O'Neil is the man you want." We found them right. The Search Committee recommends that Mr. O'Neil be elected the University's next President.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NOMINATION OF ROBERT MARCHANT O'NEIL AS PRESIDENT Mr. Carl W. Smith placed in nomination the name of Robert Marchant O'Neil as President. The nomination was seconded by Mr. John S. Battle, Jr., Mrs. George M. Cochran, and Mr. Joshua P. Darden, Jr. There were no other nominations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ELECTION OF ROBERT MARCHANT O'NEIL AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY AND AS GEORGE M. KAUFMAN PROFESSOR OF LAW The following resolution was unanimously adopted: RESOLVED that Robert Marchant O'Neil be and he is hereby elected President of the University of Virginia and George M. Kaufman Professor of Law, effective September 1, 1985.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PRESENTATION OF THE PRESIDENT-ELECT TO THE BOARD Mr. O'Neil was escorted to the meeting room of the Board of Visitors and was presented to the Visitors by the Rector.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RESOLUTION OF THANKS TO THE RECTOR AND THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON THE NOMINATION OF A PRESIDENT The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED that the sincere thanks of the Board of Visitors be expressed to our Rector, Mr. Fred G. Pollard, and to our fellow Visitors, Mr. John S. Battle, Jr., Mrs. George M. Cochran, Mr. Joshua P. Darden, Jr., Mr. Carl W. Smith, Mr. E. Massie Valentine, and Dr. Edgar N. Weaver for the outstanding work they have done incident to making a nomination for the high office of President of the University of Virginia. We particularly appreciate the contributions of the faculty and student committees for the excellent reports they provided for the use of the Special Committee. We also express appreciation and thanks to Mr. Vincent Shea for his distinguished work as Secretary of the Committee. Following a recess for Executive Session of the Board of Visitors, the Open Session continued at 2:30 p.m., on January 25, 1985.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">STATEMENT OF THE BOARD OF VISITORS REGARDING THE HONOR SYSTEM The following statement read by Mr. Joshua P. Darden, Jr., was approved as a Statement of the Board of Visitors: OnNovember 3, 1983, President Hereford issued a statement to the University community expressing his deep concern about the functioning and welfare of the Honor System. He recommended the establishment of an ad hoc Committee of the Board of Visitors on the Status of the Honor System, which the Rector subsequently appointed. During the past year the committee held public meetings and gained the perspectives and points of view of a number of students, faculty, and administrators. The committee was also informed of the growing instances of students admitting to an honor offense but being found not guilty because their act was not judged reprehensible. Minutes of the committee meetings were distributed to the Board. The Board met this morning with the current leadership of the Honor Committee. The reprehensibility standard for a finding of guilt had been approved in a University-wide student referendum a number of years previously and had clearly led to inconsistent interpretations and judgments. The committee was pleased when this past fall the student body voted to remove as a defense to an honor violation the plea that the act was not reprehensible. Discussions centered on the operation of the System since the elimination of reprehensibility as a criterion for conviction and on the sharp increase in honor convictions and voluntary withdrawals by those accused of honor offenses during the current session. The Board of Visitors, sensing a revitalized effort on the part of the Student body to make the Honor system work effectively, reaffirms its commitment to the student-run System so dear to the University's students and alumni. The Board will continue to delegate its authority over honor offenses to the students with the expectation that their renewed commitment to an effective Honor System continues and asks the University administration and faculty to lend their support and cooperation toward this student effort.</field>
