SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO STUDY AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF VISITORS ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE DUTIES OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE BOARD OF VISITORS: The following Committee, who is requested to report back to the Board within sixty days' time, is appointed by the Rector, Edward R.

Wailes MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE MATTERS: Mrs. Bertha Wailes, Chairman of the Committee on Mary Washington, presented the following matters for consideration. Action was taken on several items as shown: The Committee on Mary Washington recommends to the Board that Dean Alvey's request for leave this summer from June 30 to August 23 be granted. He is to teach a graduate course in education at the University of Virginia Summer School. The Mary Washington summer school session will have been started when he takes up his duties at the University, and he plans to spend one day weekly in his office at Mary Washington during this period. President Newcomb reports that after consultation, the leave for Dean Alvey was granted. The city of Fredericksburg asked permission to erect radio antenna on the water tank located on Mary Washington grounds. The Committee recommends that this be granted, provided that the college shall be relieved of responsibility or liability for any accident resulting from the use of the tower by the city, and that the city shall make such installations as will protect the tower from lightning, and shall give the college written assurance that the necessary examination as to adequate protection has been made by competent authority. Approved. With authorization from the Board, the Committee in turn authorized President Combs to ask Governor Tuck to approve the expense of installing wainscoting in the downstairs rooms of Brompton as originally planned (estimate $6,000). Approved. President Combs brought up the matter of three professors who have reached retirement age but who wish to continue teaching. (Professors Faulkner, Haensel, and Tanner). The Committee approved the recommendation of President Combs for their reappointment if at the beginning of the session their physical condition permits carrying the load assigned them. Approved. The question of investing the gift of $7,000 received from Mrs. DuPont was discussed, the indenture having been made to the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University. The Committee recommends to the Board that it ask the Finance Committee to invest the above amount in DuPont stock, if possible, and that any Mary Washington funds be kept in separate trust accounts. This matter was referred to the Finance Committee. The meeting then adjourned. E. R. Stettinius Rector E. I. Carruthersa Secretary</field>
