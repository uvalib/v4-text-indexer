      <field name="fulltext">ATTACHMENT A = (Approval of Re-roofing Plans for Pavilion X) June 17, 1987 Jeffersonian Restoration Advisory Board MINUTES OF DESIGN COMMITTEE MEETING Date of Meeting: Wednesday, June 17, 1987, 2-4 p.m. Location: North Oval Room of the Rotunda Attending: Mr. DiValmarana Mr. Howard Mrs. Maury Mr. Nichols Mr. Palazzo Mr. Jack Waite, Special Guest Distribution: Dean Robertson, Chairman Mr. Duell Mr. Haas Mr. Middleton Mrs. Shackelford A special meeting of the Design Committee was called on June 17th to consider the reroofing of Pavilion X. Toward that end Mr. Jack Waite was invited to discuss recent archaeological findings and give his firm's opinions on the issues involved. Mr. Howard opened the meeting at 2:00 p.m. and asked for any comments on minutes of the previous meeting. The minutes were ratified as written. Mr. Clay Palazzo, recently hired as Assistant Architect for the Historic Buildings and Grounds, was introduced to the Committee. He is a 1987 graduate of the masters degree program in design from the University of Virginia School of Architecture. He also has a masters degree in Historic Preservation from Columbia University. Mr. Jack Waite, partner in the architectural firm of Mendel Mesick Cohen Waite Hall (MMCWH), of Albany, New York, was welcomed. As explained at our last meeting, his firm has been retained as our consultant for preparation of PHASE I of the Historic Structures Report. They have also been retained to research and advise on the roof work for Pavilion X. Mr. Howard described the background of thinking and discussion during the past five years regarding whether or not to alter principal roof forms and materials on the pavilions and hotels. During that time the one point of agreement was that the scarcity of written or drawn evidence would require thorough investigation of physical evidence, i.e., archaeological investigation. Hence, no major alterations have been executed and, to the extent possible, roof repair has encapsulated older roofing beneath new outer layers. The evidence for balustrades and parapets thought to have been located atop five pavilions and three hotels was also fragmentary and, in most cases, contradictory or too incomplete to act upon. Thus all action on recreating such features was delayed until investigation beneath existing roofing and in archives could be undertaken. Mr. Waite and Mr. Howard presented slides showing existing conditions at Pavilion X. During the spring term, portions of the slate and metal coverings were removed, revealing small metal plates of the Jeffersonian era. Drainage patterns were shown to have been radically altered since the 1820s, with subsequent elimination of a large wooden attic-zone-like parapet and conversion to a slate covering for most of the roof. Analysis of the materials indicates that the metal is Welsh "tinplate" (wrought iron dipped in pure tin) that would not have been produced after about 1840. The standard plate size was cut in half, yielding plates that were approximately 10'' by 6-1/2'' in size. The plates were locked and nailed along their vertical edges and overlapped along their horizontal edges. Near the lower portion of each roof plane, where roof pitch was minimal, the plates were also soldered on all four sides. Attachment points for brackets, straps and bolts used to hold the parapet in place were located. Paint shadows yielded some evidence of the location and footprint of the parapet. Photographic evidence discovered three years ago shows that the front portion of the parapet was not executed as Jefferson's sketches had shown. Mr. Waite presented his firm's recommendations, which were: 1. Since the remaining metal clearly shows how Jefferson's workmen had first installed the roof and that the material used apparently lasted many years without trouble (as contrasted with his student room "rooflets"), MMCWH recommends removing all the slate and reestablishing metal as the exposed roofing material. 2. The Jeffersonian-era metal is very thin Welsh "tinplate," which is no longer produced. The failure of the original tinplate, due to corrosive effects of the slate covering, has yielded it incapable of being exposed to the elements; nor can it effectively prevent intrusion of water into the attic. MMCWH recommends encapsulating the original metal beneath a thin layer of plywood covered with neoprene, then replicating the metal plates atop that encapsulation, using 30-gauge terne-coated stainless steel. Such an approach would demonstrate Jefferson's essential design concept and craft methodology. It would offer yet another opportunity to resuscitate early construction skills long forgotten and, in this case, unusual even in their own day. Stainless steel, being corrosion resistant, should produce a roof with a longevity of approximately 100 years. 3. Another advantage of using terne-coated stainless steel is that it will patinate to a grey color or it can be painted. One disadvantage of painting is that, once begun, it must be continued indefinitely, thus introducing a substantial long-term maintenance cost. Paint research yet to be conducted on less damaged areas of the early roofing should offer some guidance. The recommendation on this issue is that we let the roof patinate to see what the grey tone will be, then reconsider the issue of painting, probably in one or two years from now. 4. The final recommendation has to do with the parapet. Archaeological investigation already described indicates that a substantial base of physical evidence for replication exists. Two design issues remain unresolved -- as yet we have only a vague notion of the design of the extreme north and south walls, and reconstruction of the early drainage pattern involves a few details that must be worked out. Both issues are being studied and will be discussed at our next Design Committee meeting, the expectation being that the two unresolved design issues can be dealt with. The task will then be to decide on the philosophical position that should be taken on this opportunity for a major reconstruction of a missing feature. Thus there is no recommendation regarding the parapet at this time. The Committee discussed all four points at great length, focusing on philosophical views, since the technical issues are reasonably straightforward. The decisions on each recommendation were as follows: 1. Accept the recommendation to remove the slate roof and have a metal roof as the exposed surface. 2. Accept the recommendation to replicate the Jeffersonian-era metal in terne-coated stainless steel, training the roofing craftsmen to apply the plates in the original manner while also encapsulating the archaeological evidence. 3. Defer a decision on whether or not to paint, pending patination of the stainless steel and further analysis of paint residues found on some portions of the roof. 4. Defer a decision on whether or not to reconstruct the parapet, pending resolution of technical matters and discussion of the philosophical impact of this reversal to an earlier condition. Thus the work on reroofing Pavilion X can proceed immediately, ensuring a weather-tight roof before the cold, rainy season. Additional reviews and approvals will be obtained at the state level by Mr. Howard. It was also mentioned that we will soon be exploring the possibility of exposing the student room "rooflets," removing the slate secondary roof and rebuilding the wooden rooflets. This experiment, if carried out, will occur at the single student room adjacent to the south facade of Pavilion X. One insurance against leakage may be a neoprene membrane beneath the wood planking of the rooflets. Also, we must grapple with the issue of fire safety, when wood roofing materials are used near working chimneys. At 4:00 p.m. the meeting adjourned. To all who could attend, thank you. Should there be any corrections to these minutes, please call me at (804) 924-6988. I shall be in touch with you in late summer with regard to our meeting schedule for the 1987-88 academic year. If the coming year is as productive as the last two have been, this Committee will indeed have demonstrated its value. Many thanks for your efforts.
