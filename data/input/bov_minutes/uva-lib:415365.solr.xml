ZONING OF PROPERTY ON CHANCELLOR STREET AND WEST MAIN STREET: Mr. Perkins, as Attorney for the Board, reported that acting pursuant to instruction given him by the President he prepared a petition asking that the property situated on the east side of Chancellor Street, extending along University Avenue for a distance of 137 feet, which is now zoned as B-1 Business District be changed from B-1 to an A-1 Residential Classification. After having this petition signed by all of the individuals owning property along both sides of Chancellor Street be presented the petition to the Council of Charlottesville at a meeting of the Council held August 2nd, 1943. Pursuant to the ordinance with reference to rezoning a Committee of the Council was appointed to investigate the proposed change and the matter was referred to the Zoning Board and on September 7, 1943, a public hearing was held by the Council. At the public hearing Dr. Thomas H. Daniel, representing the Dunnington interests, opposed the change but made a proposal for a compromise, upon the following terms- A portion of the front of the Dunnington property, fronting on University Avenue for a distance of 100 feet westward from the line of Mrs. W. W. Kelly and extending back between parallel lines a distance of 90 feet shall be changed from B-1 Business to B- Business. All the residue of the Dunnington property, including 37 feet on University Avenue next to Chancellor Street, and all the rest of the area fronting Chancellor Street back to the C &amp; O Railway right of way to be changed from B-1 Business to A-1 Residence. A resolution was then offered by Mr. Adams, seconded by Mr. Nash, providing for the rezoning of the whole property in accordance with the University's petition. A substitute was at once offered by Mr. Morris and seconded by Mr. Huff to rezone the property in accordance with Dr. Daniel's proposed compromise. It being apparent that no action could be taken, since any change in the zoning could only be made upon three-fourths affirmative vote, and there being five members of the Council, the motions were laid on the table, no vote taken, and Mr. Perkins was requested to present the situation to the Board of Visitors and ask for further instructions. After consideration of the situation the following resolution was adopted- RESOLVED, That this Board is strongly opposed to any further encroachment of business around the grounds of the University of Virginia. The Board, therefore, respectfully declines to agree to Dr. Daniel's proposal of compromise. MAZYCK WILSON SHIELDS BEQUEST: RE: TUNG LAND DEVELOPMENT MATTER: The President presented for consideration the following letter received from Mr. Christopher B. Garnett to whom had been referred for investigation the bequest of the Mazyck Wilson Shields to the University of Virginia a certain interest in the Tung Land Development Company, of Florida: Washington, D. C. September 3, 1943 Dr. John Lloyd Newcomb President, University of Virginia Charlottesville, Va. In re: Estate of Mazyck Wilson Shields Dear Dr. Newcomb: I have just come from a conference with Mr. Mahlon C. Masterson, attorney for Richard C. Marshall, Administrator d.b.n., c.t.a. of Mazyck Wilson Shields, and while in his office Mr. Masterson showed me a letter which he had received from Mr. Perkins. As I understand the legal situation it may be briefly stated as follows: There is a balance due, or to be come due, of $1350 by the estate of Mazyck Wilson Shields on the contract for the development of the Tung land. The administrator feels that this contract was secured by fraud and is not disposed to pay the same. In spite of the fact that the contract is related to the Tung land which Mrs. Shields purchased, if the contract be valid and not void on account of fraud, it is an obligation which rests upon the administrator and must be paid. The title to the Tung land, however, passes by the will of Mrs. Shields to the University of Virginia and the Virginia Military Institute in equal shares. It is doubtful whether the land is worth the amount due under the aforesaid contract. Therefore I have made this suggestion to Mr. Mahlon C. Masterson, attorney for the administrator, and am also making it to you, to be considered by you and Mr. Perkins, and also for the purpose of study by the Virginia Military Institute, viz: That a proposition be made by the University of Virginia and Virginia Military Institute to the Tung Land Development Company to release their interest in the Tung Land, provided, however, that the Tung Land Development Company will release and discharge the contract with Mazyck Wilson Shields for the development of said land. I mentioned this proposition to Mr. Masterson and he seemed to be in accord that it was a good idea if it could be effected. If Mr. Perkins desires to have a conference with Mr. Masterson and myself both of us will be very glad to see him in Washington. I am sending you herein a copy of this letter for Mr. Perkins' files and a copy to be forwarded to the Superintendent of Virginia Military Institute. With kindest regards, I am Very truly yours, Signed: C. B. Garnett CBG/AEC Following its reading and discussion, the following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED, that a proposition be made by the University of Virginia and Virginia Military Institute to the Tung Land Development Company to release their interest in the Tung Land, provided, however, that the Tung Land Development Company will release and discharge the contract with Mazyck Wilson Sheilds for the development of said land, and, RESOLVED, FURTHER, that if this proposition is accepted by the Tung Land Development Company the President be, and he is hereby, directed to sign a deed of release on behalf of the University which will release and discharge its interest in the land of the Tung Land Development Company. LYON GIFT TO THE LAW LIBRARY: The President announced a gift of Frank Lyon, of Washington, D. C., to the Law Library, consisting of Inter-State Commerce Commission Reports, whereupon the following resolutions were adopted: RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we accept with gratitude and appreciation the offer of Mr. Frank Lyon, of Washington, D. C., to present to the University of Virginia Law Library all of the Inter-State Commerce Commission Reports from 1887 to 1940, comprising approximately 250 volumes. RESOLVED, FURTHER, that this gift be accepted in memory of Mr. Lyon's father, John Lyon, and son, Frank Lyon, who were students in the University of Virginia, and that the President be and he is hereby directed to write a letter to Mr. Lyon expressing the gratitude of this Board for his gift, and arrange with Mr. Lyon for the transmittal of these volumes to the Law Library of the University of Virginia.

Anderson, Chairman of the Special Committee on investigation of the academic department of the University, made averbal progress report covering the several meetings that had been held with the deans and faculty members, and stated that a written report with suggestions would be made at a later meeting.
