      <field name="fulltext">10 November 1950 The regular monthly meeting of the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia was held on this date in the Office of the President of Mary Washington College, Fredericksburg, Virginia, with the following present: The Rector, Barron F. Black; President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., of the University of Virginia; Dr. M. L. Combs, President of Mary Washington College; Visitors Anderson, Garnett, Gay, Mears, Smith, Wailes and Willis. Absent: Visitors Barksdale, Carrington, Emmett, Gravatt, Howard and Talbott. The minutes of the meeting of October 13, 1950, which had been copied and mailed to the members, were approved GIFTS The President reported the following gifts which had been received. From Mr. Samuel M. Bemiss, a Milan 1478 edition of "Letters of Pliny the Younger," valued at $ 500.00 Contributions to the Institute of Public Affairs, Summer 1950 7,543.74 - - - Upon recommendation of the President, the following resignations, leaves of absence, changes in title, and appointment were approved. RESIGNATIONS RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Dr. Samuel Hay, Instructor in Internal Medicine, be and it is hereby accepted, effective October 31, 1950. RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Mr. Arthur D. Code, Instructor in Astronomy, be and it is hereby accepted, effective November 1, 1950. LEAVE OF ABSENCE RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dr. Weldon Cooper, Professor of Political Science and Associate Director of the Bureau of Public Administration, be and he is hereby granted part-time leave of absence to assist the Governor with some special work in Richmond. RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dr. Louis Otto Quam, Associate Professor of Geography, be and he is hereby granted leave of absence for the session of 1950-51 in order to continue his work in the office of Naval Research. CHANGES IN TITLE RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the title of Dr. David M. Wright be and it is hereby changed from Professor of Commerce and Business Administration to Professor of Economics RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the title of Dr. A. A. Hill be and it is hereby changed from Professor of English and English Philology to Professor of the English Language. APPOINTMENT Major Lawrence H. Alexander appointed Assistant Professor of Military Science and Tactics, as of October 16, 1950, without salary from the University. UNCOLLECTIBLE HOSPITAL ACCOUNTS The following resolution was adopted. RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts schedules 161, 162, 163 and 164, aggregating $24,839.22, recommended by them for cancellation. Concern was expressed by several members of the Board over the amount of Hospital accounts which are being charged off. The President was asked whether the Governor and the State Legislature were aware of this practice. Mr. Darden stated that the procedure followed by the University had been established by the Auditor of Public Accounts, which procedure was similar to that employed at the Medical College of Virginia. He stated that on numerous occasions when he was Governor both institutions had brought to his attention the large amount of service being furnished to indigents, and that since he had been President of the University of Virginia he had discussed the matter with the Governor and the State Legislature. The Secretary was requested to submit an annual statement at the end of each calendar year showing the total amount of charge-offs during the year. The President offered to write the Governor and express the concern of the Board over these charge-offs and its desire for the Governor to be cognizant of the situation at the University Hospital. GARDEN CLUB RESTORATION PROJECT Mrs. Smith reported that the Garden Clubs of Virginia had earmarked approximately $40,000 of its receipts for the restoration of University gardens and would dedicate its income from the 1951 Garden Week to the same purpose. The governing board of the Garden Clubs had asked Mrs. Smith to explore with the Board of Visitors the type of maintenance which the University would provide for these gardens after they were restored. After discussion of the matter, the President and Mrs. Smith were requested to draft a letter to the Garden Clubs of Virginia setting forth the University's responsibility for the maintenance of these gardens, this letter to be presented to the Board for consideration at its next meeting. INSCRIPTIONS FOR ACADEMIC BUILDING The President presented the recommendations of the Committee to select inscriptions for the two tablets above the doors of this building, which Committee was composed of President Darden, Dr. Newcomb, and Dean Lewis. Their recommendations were as follows "What a man ought never to forget with regard to a college is that it is a nursery of principle and of honor." Woodrow Wilson Swarthmore Address Vol. III, p. 55. "Here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it." Thomas Jefferson to William Roscoe, December 27, 1820. The Board approved the selection from Thomas Jefferson, but requested that the Committee find a substitute for the selection from Woodrow Wilson. NEW INTRAMURAL FIELD AND PARKING SPACE The President presented a proposal to provide additional playing fields and overflow parking for Scott Stadium in an area between the road connecting the east and west stands and a steep gulley which runs behind the houses occupied by Mrs. Hough and the Engineers Club. To prepare this area, trees will have to be cleared and the President stated that bids to cut and remove all the trees had been secured. The high bidder was the Yancey Bark and Lumber Company, which offered $3.60 per cord to cut and remove the trees. The Board approved the plan and authorized the President to accept the offer of the Yancey Bark and Lumber Company APPLICATION FROM ARCHITECTURAL FRATERNITY The President presented a letter from the Killikrates Chapter of the Alpha Rho Chi Fraternity requesting permission of the University to build a small lodge to be designed by Professor Makielski of the School of Architecture, said structure to be located on University property behind the Zeta Psi Fraternity House and immediately adjacent to the C. and O. railroad tracks. The fraternity stated that in the event the University should require the land, it would sell the structure for no more than the original investment of $1,500, with annual depreciation of five per cent. The President stated that he did not believe the land would be needed by the University, as it was very close to the railroad tracks and was not suitable for University building purposes. He recommended that the request be granted, which recommendation was unanimously approved by the Board. SIGNING OF ALCOHOL TAX UNIT REPORTS The following resolution was adopted. RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. George Warren, Purchasing Agent for the University and the University Hospital, be and he is hereby authorized to sign reports to the Alcohol Tax Unit for the University Hospital. NCAA REGULATIONS In Mr. Carrington's absence Mr. Gay reported for the Committee on the Study of NCAA Regulations. This Committee held a meeting in Richmond at which it considered the matters referred to it by the Board of Visitors at its October meeting. The Committee concluded that it was without the means of securing data showing violations of the NCAA Code by other institutions. The Committee felt that it should attempt to determine what changes in the Code were to be proposed at the annual meeting of the NCAA. At the Chicago meeting of the NCAA Council, by a vote of eight to five, the following amendment of Article III, Section 4, was adopted: "Article III "Section 4. Principles Governing Financial Aids to Athletes. Financial aids in the form of scholarships, fellowships or otherwise, even though originating from sources other than persons on whom the recipient may be naturally or legally dependent for support, shall be permitted without loss of eligibility (a) if approved and awarded on the basis of need by the regular agency established in the recipient's institution for granting of aids to all students, provided, however, that if the aid thus awarded exceeds the amount of tuition for instruction and for stated incidental institution fees, the institution shall file with an agency or agencies approved by the Association and on forms approved by the Association a certificate setting forth the need of the student for financial aid and the amount of aid awarded to him. "(b) (No change) "(c) (No change) Mr. Gay reported that Captain Pritchett had attended the NCAA Committee meeting in Richmond and had been able to furnish the Committee with the breakdown of the vote of the Executive Council on amending Article III. It was felt by the Committee that the best policy to pursue was to attempt to persuade the five members who had voted against the change in Article III to reverse their stand. Captain Pritchett had also reported to the Committee that Mr. Willett, President of the NCAA, was considering the feasibility of introducing a counter-amendment to Article III which would limit aid to $300 over and above the present limitation. Mr. Black then inquired if any information had been gathered as to what stand would be taken by other institutions who are now in non-compliance with the NCAA Sanity Code. It was reported that as yet no investigation of this matter had been undertaken. HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION Action on this matter was deferred until Dr. Emmett could be present. The President stated that this matter was urgent and requested that a special meeting of the Board be held. The Rector was requested to arrange a special meeting to consider the report of the Medical Committee of the Board concerning this matter. It was agreed that this meeting would be held in Richmond, and Mr. Gay offered the use of the offices of his firm for this meeting. MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE MATTERS LEAVE OF ABSENCE Upon recommendation of President Combs, the following resolution was adopted. RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the request of Dr. Kurt F. Leidecker, Assistant Professor of Philosophy, for a leave of absence for the second semester of the session 1950-51 be and the same is hereby granted. BUILDING PROGRAM President Combs made the following report to the Board The new central heating plant is complete and has been in operation for several weeks. The architects estimate that the construction on the dining halls is eighty-five to ninety per cent complete and the contractor expects to finish this work by Christmas. The architects estimate that the work on the Infirmary is seventy per cent complete and that the building will be ready for occupancy in the late Spring PROPOSED FINE ARTS BUILDING Dr. Combs reported that the Governor has approved drawings and specifications for the proposed Fine Arts Building and authorized the college to seek bids for construction. The bids are to be opened on Thursday, December 14. In view of the fact that the Board must approve any contract which may be awarded, it would save time if the December meeting of the Board could be held on Friday, December 15, instead of the regular date which would be December 8. Otherwise it would be necessary to delay the whole matter for at least another month. The Board approved the request of President Combs that the December meeting of the Board be changed from the regular date, which would fall on the 8th, to December 15th, in order to consider bids for the Fine Arts Building as soon as possible. SALARY OF PRESIDENT COMBS At the September 1950 meeting, Mr. Gay was requested to explore with the State budget authorities the possibility of an increase in the salary of President Combs to $10,000 per year. Mr. Gay reported that he had discussed the matter with both the Budget Director and the Governor. Prior to this meeting he had asked the Budget Director if a decision had been reached and was informed that the Governor was making an investigation of the matter before reaching a decision. MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE AUDIT REPORT President Darden reported to the Board the receipt of the audit report on Mary Washington College operations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1950. A copy of this report was turned over to the Finance Committee. BUDGET SCHEDULE The Finance Committee was requested to work out with Mr. Woodward of Mary Washington College a budget calendar similar to that which had been established for the University - - - On motion the meeting was then adjourned. Barron F. Black Rector Vincent Shea Secretary</field>
