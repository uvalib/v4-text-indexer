On motion it was RESOLVED that a special committee of three members of the Board be appointed on Student Activities, to consider student problems, and to meet with the students, to act as liaison with the Board. Mr. Gay brought up the question of the University's relation to "Corks &amp; Curls" and asked that the matter be referred to this committee for study and report back to the Board.

In addition, there shall be added to all fraternity loans these sums expended by the University of Virginia for taxes, insurance and repairs, and also sums owed the University for unpaid interest. New contracts shall be worked out with each fraternity on the balances arrived at by this method with proper amortization of principal arranged for in these contracts. It shall be optional with all of the fraternities as to whether or not they shall accept this proposition. The Committee respectfully recommends that the Board of Visitors take appropriate action affirming the action of the committee as set out in the resolution above stated. Respectfully submitted.
