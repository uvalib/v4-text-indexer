In connection with the recommendation of the special committee on the athletic situation situation submitted at a meeting of the Board, March 26, 1946, "that the remaining debt of the Old General Athletic Association to the University be balanced" in order to more clearly explain the intent of the action of the Board in the matter, the following motion was adopted: Since it appears to the Board that the receipts from intercollegiate athletics over the last four or five years have exceeded the expenditures in this field during the same period by an amount equal to if not in excess of the debt of the old Athletic Association to the University of Virginia remaining at the end of the current year, and since the excess earnings of intercollegiate athletics have been used by the University for its general purposes instead of applying them to the payment of the old indebtedness; NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the remaining debt of the old Athletic Association to the University of Virginia in the amount of $25,681.55 evidenced by bonds of the Athletic Association, be and the same is hereby charged off our books and the bonds are hereby ordered cancelled. On motion it was RESOLVED that a special committee of three members of the Board be appointed on Student Activities, to consider student problems, and to meet with the students, to act as liaison with the Board. Mr. Gay brought up the question of the University's relation to "Corks &amp; Curls" and asked that the matter be referred to this committee for study and report back to the Board. The following report of the Finance Committee was received and the recommendations contained therein were approved by the Board: The Finance Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, respectfully reports to the Board of Visitors, as follows; That on May 22, 1946, a meeting of this committee was held at the office of Scott &amp; Stringfellow in Richmond, Virginia, with the following present: Mr. Barron F.

In addition, there shall be added to all fraternity loans these sums expended by the University of Virginia for taxes, insurance and repairs, and also sums owed the University for unpaid interest. New contracts shall be worked out with each fraternity on the balances arrived at by this method with proper amortization of principal arranged for in these contracts. It shall be optional with all of the fraternities as to whether or not they shall accept this proposition. The Committee respectfully recommends that the Board of Visitors take appropriate action affirming the action of the committee as set out in the resolution above stated. Respectfully submitted. Barron F. Black, Chairman Thomas B. Gay. THE BUDGET FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1946-47: President Newcomb presented the budget for 1946-47, carrying estimated revenues from all sources of $4,429,812.00, and estimated expenditures of $4,340,876.00, with an estimated surplus of $88,936.00 after considerable time had been devoted to studying the various divisions and departments, it was unanimously adopted.

Ryan, Assistant Professor of Spanish from $2,150 to $2,550 for the session of 1946-47, plus the additional pay effective July 1, 1946 in lieu of the bonus expiring June 30, 1946. LEAVES OF ABSENCE: That the leave of absence to Dr. W. Edwin Hemphill be extended for two years from July 1, 1946, to enable him to serve as Director of Virginia World War II History Commission to which he has been promoted.
