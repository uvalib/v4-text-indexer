Annual leave is earned (accrued) on the basis of fifteen hours a month (7 1/2 for the first half; 7 1/2 for the second half). Part-time (salaried) librarians earn leave in proportion to their working time. 2. Up to the equivalent of 30 days or 240 hours of annual leave may be accumulated during the first nine years of service; the equivalent of 42 days or 336 hours may be accumulated after ten years or more of employment. 3. Allowing for unused time to be carried over from previous years, a maximum of 30 working days can be taken in any one school year for the first nine years; a maximum of 42 working days for ten years of service and beyond. For purposes of this paragraph a school year shall be considered September 1 through August 31. 4. Compensatory time, which may be earned only with the approval of the department head, must be used within one year of the date on which it is earned. 5. Sick leave is earned at the rate of 14 hours per month. Note: No payment is made for accumulated sick leave upon termination. 6. Leave of absence without pay shall not be allowed until all other applicable balances of leave with pay have been used. That is, all annual and compensatory leave (and sick leave if the employee is absent for illness) must be used before going on leave without pay. 7. Upon promotion from a classified position to general faculty status (exempt position), all accumulated annual leave and compensatory time will be paid in a lump sum. Leave cannot be carried over from a classified position to an exempt position. 8. Leave records are to be maintained by the appropriate department head. 9. All annual leave that is due a professional librarian (holding general faculty status) and which the librarian is eligible to use within the current leave year (e.g., September 1 through August 31) must be taken prior to the termination date entered on the Faculty Separation form as no payment will be made for unused annual leave or compensatory time. 10. Maternity leave is subject to the provisions of the policy statements applicable to non-academic employees dated March 20, 1973 and July 7, 1971.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">APPROVAL OF POLICY STATEMENT ON USE OF THE CENTRAL GROUNDS The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following policy statement on the Use of the Historic Central Grounds of the University be and it is hereby approved: General Statement: The Historic Central Grounds, consisting of the Rotunda, the Lawn, the Amphitheatre and the Pavilion Gardens, is the focal point of interest for visitors to this institution as well as for members of the University community. Emphasis is placed upon accessibility. This area and these facilities are to be enjoyed by the public they attract. The Gardens and the Lawn are primarily for viewing, and traffic and use which would encroach upon the planted areas are to be discouraged. A certain dignity is to be observed in the use of the Rotunda. It is not to stand as a sterile shrine, neither is it to be envisaged as an auxiliary lecture hall nor a substitute student union. These statements of policy shall be reviewed periodically by a standing committee, known as the Historic Central Grounds Committee, which may make recommendations for changes to the President. Until changed, they are to be administered by the Curator of the Historic Central Grounds. ROTUNDA - GENERAL The restored Rotunda will permanently house furnishings of great value and a substantial segment of the University's first library collection, which Mr. Jefferson assembled. From time to time other valuable collections will be exhibited. As a consequence, security measures will be required with attendants on hand to insure their effectiveness. Occasionally the Dome Room may be in use while the building is open, and the interior design makes it impossible to secure it. Stands should be placed on the stairways notifying visitors when the Dome Room is temporarily closed. The Rotunda will normally be locked at 5:00 p.m. for the night. If any room is reserved for use after 5:00 p.m., security guards will be on duty in the Rotunda and the cost of this security service will be charged to the organization making the reservation. When a request is made for room reservation, the Curator may consult with the Historic Central Grounds Committee to determine if the proposed use is in compliance with this policy. The denial of a reservation request by the Curator may be appealed through normal administrative channels. ROTUNDA - DOME ROOM Guided tours of the Dome Room will be available when the room is not reserved for special occasions. Such occasions might include University-wide receptions and dinners, special ceremonies, and official entertainment of groups by the President. In each case, the occasion should be of such importance and general interest to the University community as to warrant the special recognition of a Rotunda presentation. Requests for reservations may be made to the Curator who will schedule the use of this room. There will be a use charge for each reserved use of the Dome Room, plus an hourly security charge after 5:00 p.m. The capacity of the room for banquet use is 134 persons; for receptions, 170 persons. Food and beverages served in the Dome Room are to be obtained through and served by University Food Services. ROTUNDA - MAIN LEVEL - WEST OVAL ROOM This room will be furnished as a ceremonial office and will be occupied by the Chairman of the Bicentennial Committee during 1976. Its primary use is that of a ceremonial office for the President of the University, an appropriate place to greet visiting dignitaries. The Curator of the Rotunda will have a desk in this room after 1976. The room itself will be on view to the public. ROTUNDA - MAIN LEVEL - EAST OVAL ROOM This room is designated as the Board of Visitors room and can seat 30 persons at its conference table. Its primary use is that of a meeting room for the Board. On certain special occasions, it may be scheduled by the Curator for other meetings. When not in use for meetings, this room will be on view to the public. ROTUNDA - MAIN LEVEL - NORTH OVAL ROOM This room will be used as a conference room and can accommodate 15 persons. A desk for the Curator may be located here during 1976. The Curator will schedule the use of this room. ROTUNDA - LOWER LEVEL - EAST OVAL ROOM This room has a seating capacity of 110 persons. Furnished with chairs and display cases, it will be used primarily as a visitors' center and assigned to the University Guide Service. ROTUNDA - LOWER LEVEL - WEST OVAL ROOM This room may be reserved for lectures and meetings of University-wide appeal. Use of the room for honor trials will have priority over other uses. This room will be scheduled by the Curator and any food or beverages served must be obtained through and served by University Food Services. Seating capacity of the room is 110 persons. ROTUNDA - LOWER LEVEL - NORTH OVAL ROOM This room will be used as a conference room and will be scheduled by the Curator. The north door will normally be kept locked. HISTORIC CENTRAL GROUNDS - THE LAWN Any formal use of the Lawn other than for academic processions is discouraged. In particular, the Lawn should not be used as an athletic playing field. The Amphitheatre is to be appropriately used for outdoor events. HISTORIC CENTRAL GROUNDS - THE GARDENS The gardens of the Pavilions are public areas. Those garden areas adjacent to the Pavilions are not required to be open to the public at all times. They are to be open when not in personal use, and they must be open on certain occasions, e.g., Garden Week. To temporarily close these gardens for personal use by the Pavilion residents, an appropriate sign may be placed upon the gates notifying the public. Where a garden is divided into two portions by an intervening wall, the remote section shall be open to the public at all times. The use of the gardens for social gatherings of University organizations is to be permitted where consistent with the occupancy of the Pavilion as a home by the resident. RESERVATIONS - Any group wishing to reserve the Amphitheatre, any Pavilion garden or any room in the Rotunds shall first obtain a reservation from the Curator of the Historic Central Grounds. No reservation of any adjacent garden shall be made except with the consent of the resident of the Pavilion, who shall be contacted by the Curator. For this purpose the Assistant to the President shall be considered the resident of Pavilion VIII, the Secretary of the Colonnade Club the resident of Pavilion VII.</field>

Guidelines for the Media Board of Directors I. Jurisdiction The Media Board of Directors shall supervise and oversee the operations of all student-operated publications and broadcast media of University-wide distribution or audiences which are either: (a) supported by mandatory student fees, or (b) supported by student fees or by other University funds or by provision of office space or equipment. II. Purpose The purpose of the Media Board of Directors shall be to promote the highest standards of journalism in the operation of student publications and broadcast media under its supervision, to guarantee their freedom and independence, and to insure that those publications are responsive to the concerns of the University community. The Media Board of Directors shall insure that the student media abide by a code of journalistic ethics and responsibilities and carry out their functions in a manner consistent with the aims and objectives of the University. The Media Board of Directors shall above all require that the media organizations provide outlets for news and opinion in a spirit of fairness, decency and truthfulness. III. Authority In addition to the powers necessary to fulfill its purposes, the Media Board shall have the authority to solicit and receive complaints, to make such investigations as may be necessary, to conduct hearings to determine the validity of complaints, to make determinations as to what, if any, corrective action is required, and to implement such corrective action. In the implementation of corrective action the Media Board may establish general policies; it shall not engage in censorship (i.e., prior restraint), and it shall not order the publication or broadcast of specific information except: (1) in the case of public censure, (2) as may be necessary to correct factual errors in previously published or broadcast information, and (3) notices of public meetings of the Media Board. In the enforcement of its directives the Media Board shall be limited to the following actions against the officers and members of the managing boards of student media organizations under its supervision: (1) Private censure and public censure published by all student news media, both actions determined by a majority vote of the membership of the Media Board; (2) Removal from position, determined by a vote of six of the seven members of the Media Board. IV. Meetings and Reports Regular meetings of the Media Board shall be held not less than once during each month of the academic year. To qualify as a regular meeting, a majority of the members shall be present. A vote of a majority of the members present shall be sufficient to decide any matter other than the challenge of a member and the censure or removal of an officer or member of the managing board of a student news media organization. The Media Board of Directors shall submit to the President written reports of its activities at the end of each regular session semester. As a separate section of the report, the Media Board shall include a summary of its periodic inspection and review of student operated radio stations. It shall make other reports as necessary. V. Constitution and By-Laws The Media Board shall adopt a constitution and by-laws consistent with this directive and the requirements of due process. Such by-laws shall include a reasonable code of ethics and responsibilities. The Media Board shall solicit the views of all student media organizations and other interested individuals in promulgating that code. VI. Membership and Organization The Media Board shall be composed of seven students appointed by the presidents of the several Schools of the University. Present media staff are to be excluded from appointment. The term of appointment will be for two years, with terms being staggered so that three members end their term one year and four the next, and with the largest School, the College of Arts and Sciences, always represented. A chairman shall be chosen by the Media Board from among the members who have served one year. Each of the members shall be appointed no later than the fall of their next to last school year before graduation. Vacancies shall be filled by the presidents of the various Schools on a rotating basis, the rotation being based upon an alphabetical listing of the Schools. Vacancies in the unexpired term of any School shall be filled within thirty days through appointment by the president representing that School. The appointment schedule beginning the fall of 1976 shall be as follows: Architecture - initial one year term, 1976-77 College of Arts &amp; Sciences - (always represented) initial one year term, 1976-77; two year terms thereafter, 1977-79, 1979-81, etc. Commerce - initial one year term, 1976-77 Education - initial one year term, 1976-77 Engineering and Applied Sciences - two year term, 1976-78 Graduate Arts and Sciences - two year term, 1976-78 Graduate School of Business Administration - two year term, 1976-78 Law - 1977-79 two year term Medicine - 1977-79 two year term Nursing - 1977-79 two year term If, prior to the consideration of any adjudicative matter, a challenge is made that one or more members of the Media Board should be excused because of conflicts in interest, the challenge shall be decided upon by a majority vote of the unchallenged members of the Media Board, and, when required, substitute members shall be selected by a majority vote; provided that if a majority of the members are challenged, the Student Activities Committee shall act upon the challenge and, if upheld, it shall select substitute members. The Media Board of Directors may at its discretion elect to have a consultant or advisor from the faculty or staff of the University who should be selected in consultation with the Vice President for Student Affairs, and who would serve ex officio and with no vote.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RESOLUTION WITH RESPECT TO HEARING THE GAY STUDENT UNION'S APPEAL FROM A DECISION OF THE PRESIDENT The following resolution was adopted: WHEREAS, the Gay Student Union has requested that the Board of Visitors hear its appeal from the President's decision with respect to funding of the Gay Student Union; and WHEREAS, the Student Activities Committee and the President, after careful review, have determined that there has been no substantial change in the Gay Student Union since the Board's 1973 decision with respect to funding the Gay Student Union; and WHEREAS, under Section 5.1 of the Manual of the Board of Visitors, the Board of Visitors has discretion in the hearing of appeals as are provided for in the University regulations; and WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors has carefully reviewed the Gay Student Union's request to hear its appeal from the President's decision.

Hereford's decision of February 4, 1976, with respect to funding the Gay Student Union, not be heard by the Board.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DISCUSSION OF THE TITLE OF THE LEGAL ADVISER The President reported to the Board that he has received correspondence from the Virginia Attorney General's Office in connection with the official titles used by the University's Legal Adviser. The Attorney General has decided that it will be necessary that the Legal Adviser have, in addition, the title of "Special Assistant Attorney General," rather than "Special Counsel," which latter title is normally applicable only to attorneys in private practice who represent state agencies on specific matters. After a discussion the Board decided that it would not be necessary to change the Manual of the Board of Visitors, which establishes the office of "Legal Adviser of the University," but that the Legal Adviser could use the title of "Special Assistant Attorney General" in addition to the title of "Legal Adviser to the University." The Board directed, however, that the minutes of this meeting show that the use of the title "Special Assistant Attorney General" did not in any way make the Legal Adviser responsible to, or subject to the control of, the Virginia Attorney General.</field>
