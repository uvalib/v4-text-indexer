      <field name="fulltext">University of Va, July 20th 1893. The Board met in pursuance of adjournment on the 13th of June last. Present. Messrs Randolph, Rector and Kean, Parrish, McCabe, R. W. Martin, McCormick and T. S. Martin of the Visitors. The Committee appointed on the 12th of June last to which was referred matters relating to the Department of Law submitted its report which was read and is in the following words and figures, to wit: To the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University, The Committee appointed on the 12th June last to whom was referred the "Communication of Profr J. B. Minor to the Rector in relation to increasing the salary of J. B. Minor, Jr, and all other matters relating to the Department of Law in the University, with instructions to report at an adjourned meeting of the Board to be held on the 20th of July next," met, pursuant to appointment, on Wednesday the 19th of July at the University at 11 o'clock A. M.. The attendance of Mr Patteson was prevented by serious indisposition. The other members of the Committee proceeded to give to the whole subject their most earnest and anxious consideration. Two leading facts were prominent, to wit: First. That in view of the advanced age of Professor Minor, and the physical weakness consequent upon his having past eighty years of age, and having during the last spring suffered from a long and severe illness, while his intellectual powers appear to be not in the slightest degree impaired, there is reason to apprehend that his physical strength may prove insufficient to enable him to support the labors of his school through the session, with unabated efficiency. Hence it appeared to us that the interests of the University and of the Law Department imperatively require that such provision be made for instruction in the Law Department, as will enable the exercises therein to be conducted with the highest attainable efficiency, in any event that may befall. Secondly. Information was received in regard to the neuralgic trouble from which John B. Minor, Jr., (heretofore appointed from year to year Instructor in the school of Common and Statute Law) has been suffering, which led your Committee to make particular inquiries, of medical experts, whether the neuralgic affection by which he has been troubled, was one likely to be transient, or whether it is of a kind from which material interference with the discharge of his duties as an instructor is to be apprehended. These inquiries have led us, with reluctance and pain, to the conclusion that the danger of material interference with his usefulness is such that we cannot, especially in view of the chances that Prof. Minor's health may yield to the strain of the senior's work, recommend his reappointment. Penetrated as we are, by the strongest sense of the great work Prof. Minor has done in the Law Department, and by his incomparable skill and excellence as a teacher of Law, as well as by what is due to his character, and eminent qualities in every respect, we felt most anxious that any recommendation we might make to the Board should have, if possible, his cordial approval. We therefore addressed him a letter, of which a copy is herewith returned, conveying to him our willingness to recommend the appointment of Mr. R. C. Minor as his assistant, with a salary of $1500., and to lighten his labors by a division of the chair of Common and Statute Law. University of Va; July 19th, 1893. Prof. John B. Minor, Dear Sir: Owing to the present condition of the health of your son, Mr. John B. Minor, Jr., we, the Committee appointed by the Board of Visitors to consider and report upon all matters pertaining to the School of Law in the University, hesitate to recommend him for re-election as your assistant for the ensuing session. We are informed, however, that your son, Mr. Raleigh C. Minor, is in vigorous health, and that he is now assisting you in your summer school. We desire to recommend him to the Board as your assistant for the ensuing session at a salary of Fifteen Hundred Dollars. We trust you will appreciate our position in this matter and that you will know that we place a high value upon the work done by Mr. John B. Minor, Jr., in your classes so long as his health continued good. We greatly regret to learn of his pain for some months past, and we trust that he may speedily be restored to perfect health. We desire to ask through you whether Mr. Raleigh C. Minor will accept the position of assistant in your school, and as we are considering the propriety of establishing a new chair in the School of Law, we will deem it a favor if you will kindly suggest the subjects to be assigned to the new chair if established. We hand you, herewith, an outline of a scheme of reorganization of the School of Law that we are considering, and we would be glad to have you give your views of the same. With sentiments of high esteem, we are Very truly yours, R. G. H. Kean Committee R. L. Parrish Committee Marshall McCormick Committee Thomas S. Martin Committee In response to this letter, he appeared before the Committee and strongly stated his objections to the suggestion of a third professorship, substantially the same as those glanced at in the Report made to the Board by the Committee of which Mr. R. L. Parrish was chairman, on the 8th day of August, 1890—see Record p. 235-7 [210-1]. He also expressed the confident belief that Mr. John B. Minor, Jr.'s ill health is of a temporary kind and should not be regarded as likely to impair his efficiency. Your Committee have felt most earnestly disposed to conform any recommendation they should make to the opinions and wishes of Prof. Minor, if it was possible to do so consistently with their duty to the University. Recognizing the danger that the age and ill health of the valued professor may at any time produce serious and injurious disorganization in the means of instruction, they have anxiously considered the best means in the power of the Board to conserve the valuable strength of the noble veteran at its head—to preserve to it as long as possible the prestige of his name and services, and at the same time so to organize it that, notwithstanding any material expansion of subjects which would prevent the course from being accomplished in one year, would at the same time provide a corps of competent instructors who, if any one of them should be disabled, would be able to continue the work without serious, or at any rate with the least possible, loss to the class. To these ends your Committee, after the most anxious consideration, have felt constrained to go counter to the views of the venerable senior professor—views which appear to them to be the result rather of his indomitable spirit, than of a realization of the conditions which actually exist. Our conclusions were communicated to Prof. Minor in the following letter: University of Va, July 19th, 1893. Prof. John B. Minor, Our Dear Sir: We have maturely considered your views in relation to the School of Law in the University, and have given them the weight that we feel your opinions on such a subject are entitled to. We have also consulted medical experts as to the prospects of the ability of Mr. John B. Minor, Jr., to give you such assistance during the ensuing session as we deem it necessary for you to have, and we are strongly advised that there is but little probability of his being able to do so. Sincerely trusting that he may in time regain his health, we feel it our duty not to recommend him for re-election for the ensuing session, and we beg that you will assure him that we have been moved to this action solely by the present condition of his health. We have determined to recommend as your assistant during the session Mr. Raleigh C. Minor, at a salary of Fifteen Hundred Dollars. We are profoundly impressed with the fact that the best interests of the University demand that we shall endeavor to prolong your usefulness by lightening your labors, and we have therefore determined to recommend the appointment of a new Professor to whom shall be assigned the subject of Mercantile Law and also the subject embraced in the first and third volumes of your Institutes. We have not reached our conclusions without much difficulty, and we trust you will find in them the burning desire to recognize your great value to the University, and to discharge our duties in the manner least objectionable to you. We beg therefore that you will convey to Mr. John B. Minor, Jr., our appreciation of the valuable work he has done as your assistant, and we again request that you will assure him that so far as he is interested in our action, we have been constrained to our course solely by the present condition of his health. Assuring you of the highest consideration, and of our very warm personal regard, we are Very truly your friends, R. G. H. Kean Committee R. L. Parrish Committee Marshall McCormick Committee Thomas S. Martin Committee It will be seen that the measures we submit involve somewhat more strength in the corps of teachers, than the actual course contemplated will at all times require. This is unavoidably involved in the idea of a reserve of force to meet emergencies. We have thought that it is due to Prof. Minor to lighten his labors and prolong his usefulness, by giving him his son, Mr. R. C. Minor, as an assistant, and to relieve him personally of such a portion of the course in the School of Common and Statute law, as will reduce the lectures he shall have to deliver, from six per week to three per week. To accomplish this we propose to establish a second chair in the School of Common and Statute Law, and to transfer to it the subjects embraced in the 1st. and 3rd. volumes of Minor's Institutes. Also to restore to this school Mercantile Law, a branch of the Common Law. There will thus be kept for Prof. Minor and his Assistant, the law of Real Property, and Procedure (that is the subjects embraced in the 2nd. and 4th volumes of Minor's Institutes) and Criminal Law. The school of Mr. Gilmore will remain as at present, except that Mercantile Law will be transferred to the new chair. It is contemplated that no addition to the present number of lectures in the Law Department shall be made (unless the number be increased by one per week—that is, two lectures on each week day. Such increase to be left to the discretion of the professors. At present there are six lectures per week, of an hour and a half each, one on each week day in the School of Common and Statute Law: and 5 lectures, of same length, in the other school) It is further desired that Prof. Minor shall personally not undertake to deliver more than three lectures a week, and that the remaing 8, or (if the aggregate number be increased to 12) 9 be distributed between Mr. Gilmore's chair and the new one, according to the time now given to the subjects taught. We therefore recommend to the Board the adoption of the following orders. 1st That Raleigh C. Minor be appointed Assistant in the School of Common and Statute Law for the ensuing session, 1893-4, with the salary of Fifteen Hundred Dollars, and be assigned to duty under the direction of Prof. John B. Minor, to aid him in the work of his chair as he shall direct. 2nd That the subject of Mercantile Law be, and is, hereby restored to the school of Common and Statute Law. 3rd That the School of Common and Statute Law be divided into two chairs, to wit: First. The Law of Real Property, Procedure (that is to say the subjects comprised in the 2nd. and 4th volumes of Minor's Institutes), and Criminal Law. This chair will remain in charge of Prof. John B. Minor and his Assistant. Second. The Law of Persons and Personal Relations, Personal Property (that is, the subjects comprised in vols. 1 &amp; 3 of Minor's Institutes), and Mercantile Law, and that a professor be appointed to said Chair. 4th The Chair now occupied by Prof. J. H. Gilmore will remain constituted as at present, with Mercantile Law omitted. 5th That not exceeding twelve lectures per week, of one and a half hours each, or the equivalent thereof, be required in the Law Department. The time now devoted to the subjects taught by Prof. Gilmore, and remaining in his class, to remain as at present, and the time now devoted to the subjects embraced in the two chairs of Common and Statute Law, to be so apportioned that three lectures per week, or the equivalent thereof in time, be delivered by Prof. Minor (or his assistant), and three per week by the Professor of Law of Persons and Personal property with such additional lectures as under the present allotment are devoted to the subject of Mercantile Law. The lectures in the Department of Law shall be so arranged as to avoid conflict. Respectfully submitted, R. G. H. Kean. R. L. Parrish. Marshall McCormick. Thomas S. Martin. Law Department, University of Virginia, July 19th, 1893. Gentlemen: Yours of this date is received, and whilst I desire to make my cordial acknowledgments for the kindly spirit manifested towards myself, as well as towards my son John, I am obliged to confess that it occasioned me not a little concern in respect to what I conceive to be the interests of the University, as affected by the creation of another professorship. A multiplication of teachers is frequently, if not generally, a curtailment of instruction. I trust it will not be so here. I am directed by my son Raleigh C. Minor, to say that if the Board in pursuance of the recommendation of your Committee, shall think fit to confer upon him the appointment of my Assistant, at the salary indicated, he will accept the post, and will perform its duties, to the extent of his ability. The kindness and consideration manifested by your Committee thus far for my son John, and for myself, justify me in hoping that in the action of the Board care will be taken to show that the omission to reappoint John arose altogether from the supposed state of his health, and not from any dissatisfaction with the performance of his duties. I remain, gentlemen, with the greatest respect &amp; esteem, Truly Yours, John B. Minor. Messrs. R. G. H. Kean. Committee R. L. Parrish. Committee Marshall McCormick. Committee Thomas S. Martin Committee Resolved. That the report of the Committee to which was referred all matters pertaining to the Department of Law at the University, be and the same is hereby adopted, and that said report, together with the correspondence between the Committee and Professor Minor be spread upon the records. 2nd That the Board hereby tenders to Mr. John B. Minor, Jr. their thanks for the efficient manner in which he has discharged his duties as assistant in the School of Common &amp; Statute Law, and while regretting that the present condition of his health prevents his re-election for the ensuing session, they trust that he may in due time be fully restored to his usual physical health and vigor. Absent R. W. Martin, called home by professional engagements. Resolved that the resolution adopted at the annual meeting (Record page 365-6 [316]), appropriating $1275.00 to the making of a card catalogue of the Library, and also appropriating $1000.00 to be applied to the purchase of books and periodicals be hereby rescinded, and that the Executive Committee be hereby authorized to appropriate such sums to the purposes above named, not exceeding the sums aforesaid, as, in the opinion of said Committee, the finances of the University shall justify. Resolved, that the recommendations of the Faculty in relation to extending the aid of the University "to young women desirous of higher culture", be hereby recommitted to the Faculty with the request that they formulate and present to the Board the regulations under which they deem it advisable for young women to be admitted to the Academic Schools of the University. Resolved, that Rev. J. Wm Jones Chaplain for the sessions of 1893-95 has permission to sublet the parsonage upon such terms and conditions as may be approved by the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings. Resolved that the Proctor pay to Mrs Mary Burthe the sum of $59.46, the board bill of the members of the Board of Visitors during the annual meeting in June 1893. Resolved, that the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings be hereby directed to have the small sewer from water closets on Carr's Hill relaid in in the manner recommended by the Board of Health at a cost not exceeding One hundred and twenty dollars. Resolved, that the Superintendent of Grounds &amp; Buildings be hereby directed to convert the Mess Hall on Dawson's Row into a Dormitory of Seven rooms, at a cost not exceeding $385, which will be taken from the fund appropriated to Repairs &amp; Improvements, provided that the rents from said Dormitory for the ensuing session shall be added to the Repair and Improvement Fund. Resolved, that after the end of the ensuing session, and until otherwise ordered, Dormitory No. 11, West Lawn, be assigned to the Student Superintendent of the Students' Reading Room, the usual rent being paid. Resolved, that Jesse Ramsburg, of Frederick, Maryland be hereby appointed to the Birely Scholarship for the session of 1893 &amp; 4. In regard to the nomination to the "Jno. Y. Mason Fellowship", mentioned in the Faculty report, Resolved that the Faculty be requested to prepare &amp; forward to the Board a general scheme for the award of this &amp; any future Fellowships to the end that the Board may be guided intelligently in making such nominations.

      <field name="fulltext">University of Va; July 19th, 1893. Prof. John B. Minor, Dear Sir: Owing to the present condition of the health of your son, Mr. John B. Minor, Jr., we, the Committee appointed by the Board of Visitors to consider and report upon all matters pertaining to the School of Law in the University, hesitate to recommend him for re-election as your assistant for the ensuing session. We are informed, however, that your son, Mr. Raleigh C. Minor, is in vigorous health, and that he is now assisting you in your summer school. We desire to recommend him to the Board as your assistant for the ensuing session at a salary of Fifteen Hundred Dollars. We trust you will appreciate our position in this matter and that you will know that we place a high value upon the work done by Mr. John B. Minor, Jr., in your classes so long as his health continued good. We greatly regret to learn of his pain for some months past, and we trust that he may speedily be restored to perfect health. We desire to ask through you whether Mr. Raleigh C. Minor will accept the position of assistant in your school, and as we are considering the propriety of establishing a new chair in the School of Law, we will deem it a favor if you will kindly suggest the subjects to be assigned to the new chair if established. We hand you, herewith, an outline of a scheme of reorganization of the School of Law that we are considering, and we would be glad to have you give your views of the same. With sentiments of high esteem, we are Very truly yours, R. G. H. Kean Committee R. L. Parrish Committee Marshall McCormick Committee Thomas S. Martin Committee</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Va, July 19th, 1893. Prof. John B. Minor, Our Dear Sir: We have maturely considered your views in relation to the School of Law in the University, and have given them the weight that we feel your opinions on such a subject are entitled to. We have also consulted medical experts as to the prospects of the ability of Mr. John B. Minor, Jr., to give you such assistance during the ensuing session as we deem it necessary for you to have, and we are strongly advised that there is but little probability of his being able to do so. Sincerely trusting that he may in time regain his health, we feel it our duty not to recommend him for re-election for the ensuing session, and we beg that you will assure him that we have been moved to this action solely by the present condition of his health. We have determined to recommend as your assistant during the session Mr. Raleigh C. Minor, at a salary of Fifteen Hundred Dollars. We are profoundly impressed with the fact that the best interests of the University demand that we shall endeavor to prolong your usefulness by lightening your labors, and we have therefore determined to recommend the appointment of a new Professor to whom shall be assigned the subject of Mercantile Law and also the subject embraced in the first and third volumes of your Institutes. We have not reached our conclusions without much difficulty, and we trust you will find in them the burning desire to recognize your great value to the University, and to discharge our duties in the manner least objectionable to you. We beg therefore that you will convey to Mr. John B. Minor, Jr., our appreciation of the valuable work he has done as your assistant, and we again request that you will assure him that so far as he is interested in our action, we have been constrained to our course solely by the present condition of his health. Assuring you of the highest consideration, and of our very warm personal regard, we are Very truly your friends, R. G. H. Kean Committee R. L. Parrish Committee Marshall McCormick Committee Thomas S. Martin Committee</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Law Department, University of Virginia, July 19th, 1893. Gentlemen: Yours of this date is received, and whilst I desire to make my cordial acknowledgments for the kindly spirit manifested towards myself, as well as towards my son John, I am obliged to confess that it occasioned me not a little concern in respect to what I conceive to be the interests of the University, as affected by the creation of another professorship. A multiplication of teachers is frequently, if not generally, a curtailment of instruction. I trust it will not be so here. I am directed by my son Raleigh C. Minor, to say that if the Board in pursuance of the recommendation of your Committee, shall think fit to confer upon him the appointment of my Assistant, at the salary indicated, he will accept the post, and will perform its duties, to the extent of his ability. The kindness and consideration manifested by your Committee thus far for my son John, and for myself, justify me in hoping that in the action of the Board care will be taken to show that the omission to reappoint John arose altogether from the supposed state of his health, and not from any dissatisfaction with the performance of his duties. I remain, gentlemen, with the greatest respect &amp; esteem, Truly Yours, John B. Minor.</field>
