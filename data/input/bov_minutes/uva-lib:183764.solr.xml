      <field name="fulltext">THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA April 3, 1993 The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met at 4:00 p.m., in Open Session, on Thursday, April 1, 1993, in the Southwest Virginia Center in Abingdon, Virginia, with the following persons present: Hovey S. Dabney, Rector, J. Scott Ballenger, Robert G. Butcher, Jr., N. Thomas Connally, Daniel A. Hoffler, J. Thomas Hulvey, Evans B. Jessee, Patricia M. Kluge, Leigh B. Middleditch, Jr., Mrs. Elizabeth D.

Ern, Robert D. Sweeney, Alexander G. Gilliam, Jr., and Ms. Jeanne F. Bailes were also present. The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met at 12:15 p.m., in Open Session, on Saturday, April 3, 1993, in the Chapel at Clinch Valley College in Wise, Virginia, with the following persons present: Rector Hovey S. Dabney, J. Scott Ballenger, W. L. Lyons Brown, Jr., Robert G. Butcher, Jr., Mortimer M. Caplin, N. Thomas Connally, Warner N. Dalhouse, J. Thomas Hulvey, Evans B. Jessee, Patricia M. Kluge, Leigh B. Middleditch, Jr., Mrs. Elizabeth D. Morie, Freddie W. Nicholas, Sr., S. Buford Scott and Albert H. Small. Messrs. John T. Casteen, III, James J. Mingle, Leonard W. Sandridge, Jr., Thomas H. Jackson, Don E. Detmer, Robert D. Sweeney, Ernest H. Ern, Jr., and Ms. Jeanne F. Bailes were also present. The Minutes of the meeting of February 6, 1993, previously distributed, were approved as corrected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">STATEMENT BY THE RECTOR The Rector made the following statement: "When the Board met in Abingdon in 1989, we presented a new sign to the Center. Some of you have observed that it has been replaced - not because it wasn't appreciated or needed. To the contrary. In four short years, what used to be exclusively the University of Virginia Center has expanded to become the focal landmark for higher education in Southwest Virginia. This building now serves as the temporary headquarters for the Southwest Virginia Higher Education Center - a collaborative partnership between the University, Clinch Valley College, Virginia Tech, and Virginia Highlands Community College. When we return four years from now, we will convene in the Center's 9.9 million dollar facility on the campus of Virginia Highlands. With innovation and growth continuing at this pace, might we expect a relocation of the Grounds by 2020? The Higher Education Center already houses graduate programs offered by the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech. Tech currently delivers on-site a master's degree program in educational administration, and its M.B.A. and engineering master's are televised to this location. Clinch Valley College sponsors undergraduate courses here and at Virginia Highlands. In addition, two other universities have proposed additional degree programs to the Board of Directors of the Southwest Center: Radford University hopes to offer a master's degree program in social work at the Southwest Center; George Mason University proposes a doctor of arts program for community college teachers. With construction of the new building, the vision will have physical as well as programmatic reality: students graduating from Virginia Highlands will be able to earn a bachelor's degree from Clinch Valley College right here in Abingdon. They then will have a wealth of graduate opportunities from which to choose. The value of these opportunities to the economic development of the region - both in attracting new companies and retaining existing employees, cannot be overstated. The University has always sought partnerships that would assure quality educational experiences for Virginians - undergraduates, graduates and working professionals. The Southwest Virginia Higher Education Center is one such partnership, where cooperating institutions can share costs while maximizing opportunities for lifelong learning. It will be exciting to come back four years from now. Today the sign, tomorrow the building."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT The President remarked that in Southwest Virginia, people often feel that "the world stops at Roanoke," that major conferences and the like are seldom held west of Charlottesville. Nonetheless, the University has been active in Southwest Virginia since at least 1926, when what is now called the Division of Continuing Education set up courses for teachers in Abingdon, Marion, Wytheville and Pulaski. The Division's presence in Southwest Virginia has continued to develop and it has been enhanced by the opening of Clinch Valley College, with whom it works in close cooperation. The Southwest Virginia Center in Abingdon, the President said, now has five staff members who work in a region which includes 13 counties and 3 cities; he paid particular tribute to the Director, Ms. Rachel Fowlkes, and the job she has done. The Center, working particularly closely with Clinch Valley College, but also with the University in Charlottesville and with Virginia Tech, offers a variety of programs essential to the well being of the region. The President then cited graduate degree programs in nursing, in guidance and counseling, in reading and in education. In short, he said, there are programs for all professions active in the area, particularly the health professions. The Center is linked to the University's televised programs in engineering and in other subjects, and in fact graduated its first engineer last spring. With the Center and with Clinch Valley College, the President concluded, the University is well represented in the Southwest.</field>

The Board covenants that the Institution will not take or omit to take any action the taking or omission of which will cause the Refunding Bonds to be "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of Section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "1986 Code"), or otherwise cause interest on the Refunding Bonds to be includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes under existing laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Institution will pay from time to time its proportional share of any rebate to the United States of the earnings derived from the investment of the gross proceeds of the Refunded Bonds or the Refunding Bonds that are subject to such rebate. Section 2. The Board represents and covenants that the Institution has not and will not permit the proceeds of the Refunded Bonds to which the provisions of Section 103 of the Internal Revenue code of 1954, as amended (the "1954 Code"), apply to be used in any manner that would result in (a) 25% or more of such proceeds being used in a trade or business carried on by any person other than a governmental unit, as provided in Section 103 of the 1954 Code, (b) 25% or more of such proceeds being used with respect to any output facility within the meaning of Section 103 of the 1954 Code considered as being used in a trade or business carried on by any person other than a governmental unit, or (c) 25% or more of such proceeds being used directly or indirectly to make or finance loans to persons other than a governmental unit, as provided in Section 103(o) of the 1954 Code. The Institution need not comply with such covenants if the Institution obtains the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that such covenants need not be complied with to prevent the interest on the Refunded Bonds or the Refunding Bonds from being includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. Section 3. The Board represents and covenants that the Institution has not and will not permit the proceeds of the Refunded Bonds to which the provisions of Section 141 of the 1986 Code apply to be used in any manner that would result in (a) 5% or more of such proceeds being used in a trade or business carried on by any person other than a governmental unit, as provided in Section 141(b) of the 1986 Code, (b) 5% or more of such proceeds being used with respect to any output facility within the meaning of Section 141(b)(4) of the 1986 Code, or (c) 5% or more of such proceeds being used directly or indirectly to make or finance loans to any person other than a governmental unit, as provided in Section 141(c) of the 1986 Code. The Institution need not comply with such covenants if the Institution obtains the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that such covenants need not be complied with to prevent the interest on the Refunded Bonds or the Refunding bonds from being includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. Section 4. The Board covenants that for so long as any of the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, the Institution will not enter into any operating lease, management contract or similar agreement (or any amendment to any existing lease, management contract or similar agreement) with any person or entity, other than a state or local governmental unit, for all or any portion of the projects financed or refinanced with such bonds without first obtaining the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that entering into such agreement will not cause the interest on the Refunded Bonds or the Refunding Bonds to be includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. Section 5. The Board covenants that for so long as any of the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, the Institutions will not sell or dispose of all or any part of the projects financed with such bonds or allow any such project to cease being a revenue producing capital project of the Institution within the meaning of Article X, Section 9 of the Constitution without first obtaining the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that such sale, disposition or cessation will not cause interest on the Refunded Bonds or the Refunding Bonds to be includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. Section 6. The officers of the Institution are authorized and directed to execute and deliver all certificates and instruments and to take all such further action as may be considered necessary or desirable in connection with the sale and issuance of the Refunding Bonds. Section 7. The Board acknowledges that the Treasury Board will rely on the representations and covenants set forth herein in issuing the Refunding Bonds, that such representations and covenants are critical to the security for the Refunding Bonds and the exclusion of the interest on the Refunded Bonds and the Refunding Bonds from the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes, that the Board will not repeal, revoke, rescind or amend any of such covenants without first obtaining the written approval of the Treasury Board and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that repealing, revoking, rescinding or amending any such covenant will not cause interest on the Refunded Bonds or the Refunding Bonds to be includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes, and that such covenants will be binding upon the Board and the Institution so long as any of the Refunded Bonds and the Refunding Bonds are outstanding. Section 8. This resolution shall take effect immediately upon its adoption.</field>
