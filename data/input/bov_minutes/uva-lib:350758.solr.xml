REQUEST FOR TESTIMONY ON COMBS HEARINGS The Rector read to the Board a letter from Mr. Chinn of Fredericksburg requesting that he be permitted to see transcripts of the hearings before the Board in December, January, and February on the charges against Dr. Morgan L. Combs. After considerable discussion, the Board resolved. (1) that the Rector be authorized to inform Mr. Chinn that Dr. Combs' Attorney, Mr. Willis, has a copy of the only existing transcript of the testimony in the hearings regarding Dr. Combs, and (2) that the Rector be authorized to say to Mr. Chinn that he may see this transcript at Mr. Willis' office, or at the office of the Secretary in Charlottesville, providing that Mr. Willis, acting for Dr. Combs, grants him permission to do so ADMISSION OF A FACULTY WIFE The President presented a letter from Mrs. Lucille Parson, student in the School of Education, and wife of Dr. William Parson, Professor of Internal Medicine, requesting permission to matriculate as a student in the College of Arts and Sciences. After some expressions of dissent, the Board resolved that the Dean of the College be directed to admit Mrs. Parson as a regular student. Mr. Talbott requested that his vote, one of three dissenting votes, be recorded ASSIGNMENT OF LAWN HOUSES Mrs. Smith presented the following Report for the Committee on Buildings and Grounds In Compliance with established policy relative to residency on The Lawn, an effort has been made by the Committee to provide proportionate representation from the several Schools, giving preferential consideration to the Deans of the Schools with consideration of seniority among applicants. It is recommended that the following assignments be made. Pavilion II, East Lawn to Dean Lewis M. Hammond Pavilion VI, East Lawn to Dean L. J. Stiles Pavilion III, West Lawn to Professor A. F. MacConochie /s/ A. D. Barksdale /s/ H. E. McWane /s/ Mrs. H. McK. Smith Chairman 9 April 1954 The Board resolved to accept and approve the Report GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION CREATED President Darden briefly reviewed the previous steps taken toward the establishment of a Graduate School of Business Administration, commented on the outstanding work of Virginia bankers and business men under the leadership of Mr. Henry E. McWane and others in raising a million-dollar fund for the foundation, and reported that the General Assembly has appropriated matching funds for the income from this fund of approximately $100,000 for the coming biennium. In the discussion which followed, it was emphasized that the new School would provide graduate instruction at an advanced level for a limited number of persons who have demonstrated superior capacity in the field either as (1) undergraduate students in economics and related subjects, or as (2) young bankers or business men demonstrating unusual promise in the performance of their work, in addition, the School would organize short courses at the University and elsewhere in Virginia, providing practical training and refresher courses for larger numbers of working bankers and business men. President Darden pointed out that the School would probably be unable to admit students earlier than September 1955. The first dean would need a year in which to plan the organization of the School and its program, to select the teachers, and to become acquainted with the University faculties and the bankers and business men of Virginia with whom he must work. After further discussion, the following Resolution was adopted. RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that a Graduate School of Business Administration be and it is hereby created as a separate School of the University. The President thereupon nominated as the first Dean of the Graduate School of Business Administration Dr. Charles Cortez Abbott, now Converse Professor of Banking and Finance in the Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration. In reference to Dr. Abbott's reputation as an authority on banking and finance, President Darden remarked that his election as the first professor in the new School would be a testimonial to the generous contributions in time and money which the bankers of Virginia are giving toward the creation of the School The Board, after discussing the qualifications of Dr. Abbott, unanimously resolved that he be elected Dean and Professor, as noted above under Elections. SEPARATE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY President Darden laid before the Board a letter from the Dean of the College, as follows UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA College of Arts and Sciences Charlottesville, Va. November 11, 1953 Office of the Dean President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. University of Virginia Dear President Darden In their Annual Reports for 1952-53, the Divisions of Philosophy and Psychology of the Corcoran Department of Philosophy and Psychology strongly recommended that they be established as separate academic Departments. This recommendation is wholly in accord with the pronounced trend of recent years in regard to such matters, and I heartily concur in it. Each of the Divisions is amply large in both staff and enrollment to be a Department, they are housed in widely separated buildings, and they function quite independently of each other The name "Corcoran" should be retained by the Department of Philosophy but not by the Department of Psychology. There was formerly only the "Corcoran School of Philosophy." I remember when the words "and Psychology" were added to the title. Sincerely yours, /s/ Geo. O. Ferguson, Jr. Acting Dean After discussion the Board adopted the following resolution RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Division of Psychology in the Corcoran Department of Philosophy and Psychology be and it is hereby established as a separate department of the College of Arts and Sciences to be designated the Department of Psychology, its chairman to be designated the Chairman of the Department of Psychology. RESOLVED FURTHER that the Division of Philosophy be and it is hereby designated the Corcoran Department of Philosophy, its chairman to be designated the Chairman of the Corcoran Department of Philosophy LYNCHBURG ALUMNI LOAN FUND The President laid before the Board a letter from the President of the Lynchburg Chapter of the University of Virginia Alumni Association, together with the Bursar's Balance Sheet for the Lynchburg Alumni Loan Fund, as follows UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA ALUMNI ASSOCIATION Lynchburg Chapter Lynchburg, Virginia April 3, 1954 Mr. W. D. Johnson, Assistant Bursar University of Virginia Charlottesville, Virginia Dear Mr. Johnson You will recall that I have, in the past, had some correspondence with you in reference to the Lynchburg Chapter of the University of Virginia Loan Fund, and as of September 30, 1953, you forwarded to me a statement not only of the assets, but of the notes receivable. At one of our Lynchburg Alumni Meetings of recent date, we unanimously passed a motion to the effect that we desire that the Lynchburg Alumni Loan Fund be returned to our Chapter for deposit in one of Lynchburg's banks in order that we may earn interest on the money when it lays idle as it has in the majority of years since 1924, and we believe that by having it in a local bank we can use this money to help students through University in many more cases, for as I informed you in past correspondence, for so many years we did not realize that this fund was still in effect at your office, therefore, would you please be so kind as to inform me as to the manner in which I should approach you for the release of such funds to our chapter Thanking you for your kind consideration of this letter, and with best wishes and kindest regards, I am Sincerely yours, /s/ William E. McBratney, Jr. President Lynchburg Alumni Loan Fund Balance Sheet At March 31, 1954 Cash $1,102.62 Notes Receivable 650.00 Total Assets $1,752.62 Reserve for Delinquent Notes 450.00 (Due Prior to January 1, 1930) Principal of Fund 1,302.62 Total Reserve and Principal $ 1,752.62 The Board adopted the following resolution RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the comptroller of the University be and he is hereby authorized to return to the Lynchburg Chapter of the University of Virginia Alumni Association the balance of the Fund advanced by the Chapter to the University for making loans to needy students, it being the understanding of this Board that the Fund will continue to be used for the purpose for which it was created. PROFESSOR WRIGHT'S COTTAGE President Darden referred to his letter to The Rector dated March 26, 1954 (copies of which have been mailed to members of the Board and to Professor Wright) reviewing the record of Professor David McC. Wright's tenancy of the cottage at No. 2 Dawson's Row, and abstracting the relevant parts of that portion of Professor Wright's correspondence on the subject which has been addressed to the President In the discussion which followed, the following points were made: (1) Residence in the University Grounds is a privilege, not a right of University professors, only a few houses are available, (2) Professor Wright originally requested and was assigned the No. 2 Dawson's Row house with full understanding that the arrangement was temporary, that the University planned demolition of the house at an early date, and that extensive repairs could not be anticipated. After stating that Professor and Mrs. Wright, in response to the Resolution adopted by the Board on March 12th, have sent to Mr. O'Grince, Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, a statement of their minimum requirements in repairs to the house, the President laid before the Board the following letter, with attached statements supporting the figures mentioned therein UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Department of Buildings and Grounds P. O. Box 1697 University, Virginia April 6, 1954 Office of the Superintendent Mr. Colgate W. Darden, Jr. President University, Virginia Dear Mr. Darden In reference to your request for an estimate on the renovation of the Wright cottage, see the attached My initial estimate of $6650 covers only those items requested by Mrs. Wright. Now as for a complete estimate on the renovation of their residence, which the writer feels will then place this home on par with other Faculty residences on the Grounds, the cost of the work involved will total $11,850. This latter figure includes the initial $6650 mentioned above Sincerely yours, /s/ S. H. O'Grince Superintendent ESTIMATE OF COSTSâRENOVATING THE WRIGHT RESIDENCE April 6, 1954 (a) Replastering and repainting entire inside area $ 2,500.00 (b) Masonry - fireplace reinforced with new brick 150.00 (c) Electrical - wiring 1,500.00 (d) Flooring 2,500.00 TOTAL $6,650.00 ESTIMATEâRENOVATION OF PROF.

Replace and rework blinds 350.00 TOTAL $11,850.00 The Board adopted the following resolution RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia (1) that the request of Professor and Mrs. Wright be denied, the expense required to perform the repairs specified as the minimum renovation satisfactory to them being unjustifiably high for a temporary cottage which is to be demolished, probably two years hence, and not later than four years from now, and (2) that the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds be directed to carry out only such miminum repairs as will make possible the tenancy of the house by Professor Wright (if he wishes to retain it) or by such other tenant as may be assigned to the house as his successor REPORT OF THE UNIVERSITY SENATE President Darden distributed to the Board, by request of the University Senate, copies of a Report submitted to the Senate on March 12th by a Committee "formed in February, 1954 for the purpose of studying the Constitution and functions of the University Senate and reporting its findings to that Senate." The President invited special attention to the section on Athletics, pages 4-6, and to the Conclusions on page 9 The discussion which followed included expressions of agreement with the "Conclusions", but members noted that the section on athletics did not indicate a comprehension of the Board's attitude on consultation with the Faculty, or of all the steps by which the Board has reached its decisions on athletics since 1950. The opinion was expressed that the Board has given meticulous attention to faculty opinion at every stage of its decisions on athletics. There was general agreement on the desirability of more contacts of the Board with Faculty members. The Board resolved: (1) that The Rector should write to Professor Runk, Secretary of the Senate, acknowledging receipt of the Report, stating that copies have been given to each member of the Board for study, and advising him of the Board's attitude and that the Board would communicate with the Senate at a later date regarding the contents of the Report, (2) that the Chairman of the Athletic Committee prepare for the use of the Board in replying to the Senate, with reference to pages 4-6, a factual summary of the steps taken by the Board on athletics from the year 1950 to the present, and (3) that the Secretary file a copy of the Report with the minutes of this meeting RECESSES AT BOARD MEETINGS On motion of Mr. Coxe it was resolved that at future Board meetings a ten-minute recess be called at 11:30. MEETINGS OF THE BOARD President Darden referred to earlier proposals for a return by the Board to its former practice of holding fewer meetings in addition to the Annual Meeting (required by law and normally held in June), and initiated a discussion on reducing next session's meetings from twelve to six, but extending the meeting period to two days in order to allow time for Board members to meet with representative members of the various faculties on the preceding afternoon or evening. The discussion included numerous expressions of approval, but members proposed that the experiment of meeting with faculty groups from the several Schools of the University be tried at once, without waiting for the organization of the next session's Board meetings. The Board thereupon resolved that the President be asked to arrange for a dinner to be held by the Board on Thursday evening May 13th, and to invite to it the Dean and several professors of the Medical School, with the object of improving acquaintances and holding informal conversations on subjects of interest to the Medical faculty.

      <field name="fulltext">UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA College of Arts and Sciences Charlottesville, Va. November 11, 1953 Office of the Dean President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. University of Virginia Dear President Darden In their Annual Reports for 1952-53, the Divisions of Philosophy and Psychology of the Corcoran Department of Philosophy and Psychology strongly recommended that they be established as separate academic Departments. This recommendation is wholly in accord with the pronounced trend of recent years in regard to such matters, and I heartily concur in it. Each of the Divisions is amply large in both staff and enrollment to be a Department, they are housed in widely separated buildings, and they function quite independently of each other The name "Corcoran" should be retained by the Department of Philosophy but not by the Department of Psychology. There was formerly only the "Corcoran School of Philosophy." I remember when the words "and Psychology" were added to the title. Sincerely yours, /s/ Geo. O. Ferguson, Jr. Acting Dean</field>
      <field name="fulltext">UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA ALUMNI ASSOCIATION Lynchburg Chapter Lynchburg, Virginia April 3, 1954 Mr. W. D. Johnson, Assistant Bursar University of Virginia Charlottesville, Virginia Dear Mr. Johnson You will recall that I have, in the past, had some correspondence with you in reference to the Lynchburg Chapter of the University of Virginia Loan Fund, and as of September 30, 1953, you forwarded to me a statement not only of the assets, but of the notes receivable. At one of our Lynchburg Alumni Meetings of recent date, we unanimously passed a motion to the effect that we desire that the Lynchburg Alumni Loan Fund be returned to our Chapter for deposit in one of Lynchburg's banks in order that we may earn interest on the money when it lays idle as it has in the majority of years since 1924, and we believe that by having it in a local bank we can use this money to help students through University in many more cases, for as I informed you in past correspondence, for so many years we did not realize that this fund was still in effect at your office, therefore, would you please be so kind as to inform me as to the manner in which I should approach you for the release of such funds to our chapter Thanking you for your kind consideration of this letter, and with best wishes and kindest regards, I am Sincerely yours, /s/ William E. McBratney, Jr. President</field>
