      <field name="heading_text">A Rationale of Literary Annotation: The Example of Fielding's Novels by Martin C. Battestin *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1751 Thomas Edwards, who in The Canons of Criticism (1748) had mischievously exploded Warburton's pompous edition of Shakespeare (1747), was urged by his friend Philip Yorke to exert himself more constructively in the future—to turn editor himself, in fact, and rescue Spenser's works from their current state of dilapidation. As canny as he was unlovable, Edwards declined the invitation with thanks, and with a degree of prudence which one can certainly appreciate: I regret as much as you do [he replied] that our Classic Authors have fallen into such unhallowed hands as they have of late been profaned by, but who am I that I can prevent the sacrilege? . . . Why, say you, publish a good Edition of [Spenser] yourself. Very well Sir—but to publish a good Edition of an Old Author is not, as we find by melancholy experience, as easy a matter as to poach eggs, nor is it to be done without a great deal of care and application, and some time too . . . . 1 That last poignant sentence has the ring of a maxim that ought to be inscribed as a motto over the portals of the Center for Scholarly Editions—the editor's analogue to "Abandon hope, all you who enter here." But I expect we will agree that the business of editing, if a more exacting enterprise than poaching eggs, is no less wholesome, good authors being in their way no less nourishing. Indeed, since they are likely to delight and instruct us the more according to how precisely we can ascertain what they wrote and what they meant, it is not too much to claim that an editor performs the fundamental act of criticism. As the work of Greg and Bowers has shown, editing in its primary aspect—that of establishing the text—has the advantage over other kinds of criticism in that its principles may be more surely formulated. There is, for instance, a certain compelling logic about the proposition that, in the absence of an author's manuscript, we can best approximate the linguistic texture of his work—the essential form in which he clothed his thought—by choosing as our copy-text the first edition, the version of the work that derives immediately from the manuscript. I have tried to demonstrate elsewhere 2 —by showing that the full sense of certain passages in Fielding's novels ultimately resides in his use of capitals, italics, type-sizes, etc.—that accuracy in this matter of rendering even the accidentals of a text is not at all the merely precious or pedantic consideration it is sometimes thought to be. Criticism as she is generally known is a disappointing mistress who has a way of changing her favorites: Richards gives place to Wittgenstein, Wittgenstein to Levi-Strauss, Levi-Strauss to Shklovsky, Shklovsky to Poulet, Poulet to Derrida, and Derrida, with any luck, will soon give way to Common Sense. The boulevards of Paris, as George Watson has noticed, are littered with ex-structuralists. But there is the permanency of sweet reason in Greg's rationale of copy-text. Editors, however, have no comparable set of principles to guide them in that other, and I believe no less important operation, the annotation of the text. As far as I am aware, the most valuable attempt to supply such a guide is Arthur Friedman's essay, "Principles of Historical Annotation in Critical Editions of Modern Texts," published some thirty-five years ago. 3 Much briefer statements of principle sometimes occur incidentally in the prefaces to scholarly editions—as, for example, in Professor Friedman's Introduction to his edition of Goldsmith 4 —but because these statements rationalize the approach to annotation which a particular editor has found congenial, their general usefulness is limited. Most reviews of scholarly editions include, moreover, incidental criticism of the explanatory notes, but such criticism, being desultory as well as widely scattered through a hundred journals, is neither systematic nor very convenient; and, being founded on the personal preferences and prejudices of individual reviewers, it is rather too subjective and impressionistic. Every editor, it appears, is confident he knows what a proper note should do, but few readers are satisfied with the results. As James Thorpe observes, 5 the editors of the Yale edition of Milton's Prose Works are at one extreme, supplying an especially copious commentary; at the other is Herbert Davis's edition of Swift's Prose Works, which eschews explanatory annotation altogether. The spectrum runs from nothing to too much, and in between these extremes one finds every degree of amplitude or dearth. Indeed, the enterprise itself of explanatory annotation is often regarded as a necessary evil (and not always even as a necessary one), provoking in scholars feelings ranging from gratitude for the light a good note can shed on the obscure places of a text to dismay at the vanity and pedantry of editors who are thought to use such opportunities to primp and strut in public. To Charles Moorman, for example, "a comprehensive, carefully-prepared set of explanatory notes is, aside from the establishment of a hitherto unprocurable text, the greatest gift an editor can bestow upon a reader"; to Samuel Schoenbaum, writing of the editing of Shakespeare, the editor who goes beyond the glossing of words and phrases is not only professionally irresponsible but morally reprehensible, since he is "having a free ride at the expense of a captive audience that has paid its money for the plays." 6 The state of the art, it appears, looks disconcertingly like anarchy; and it is time that those of us who are engaged in the exacting and, as our readers will assure us, expensive business of preparing "definitive" editions of major authors should follow Professor Friedman's lead in asking ourselves what, if anything, can be done to introduce a measure at least of order into the confusion—to mark out a terrain ample and firm enough to accommodate and support such a wide variety of edifices. The attempt is not likely to be entirely satisfactory, for, as I hope to make clear, much of the confusion, contradiction, and inconsistency that has characterized literary annotation from the time of Bentley and Warburton to the present is an inevitable function of the nature of the enterprise itself. This being so, I mean by the indefinite article in my title—which might otherwise seem to imply that I am here trying to do for the literary annotator what Greg has done for the textual editor—to emphasize that this will be a wholly tentative essay in which, on balance, I will be more concerned with defining the relative aspects of the problem than with proposing absolute solutions. Though I am persuaded that there is essentially one sound rationale for the treatment of copy-texts, I am no less convinced that there can be no single rationale of literary annotation that will prove universally practicable and appropriate. For, though they are colleagues in the community of textual criticism, the provinces of editor and annotator are different in kind. The editor is concerned with establishing the ideal form of the text, its physical reality on the printed page. The choices confronting him as he selects and arranges the linguistic signs which constitute the literary work as the author intended it will be essentially the same choices whether he is editing Shakespeare or Milton, Fielding or Hume. The element of uniformity in this operation makes it susceptible, therefore, of a kind of rational control and discipline that it is not too much to describe as scientific; and, like a scientist, the editor as he performs his task will be as objective and as unobtrusive as possible. The task of the annotator, on the other hand, is to mediate between the text which the editor has thus established and the reader who wishes to recover its meanings wherever they are obscure. Being concerned therefore with the mental, as it were, rather than the physical reality of the work, he will function not as scientist, but as historian and critic. He is necessarily obtrusive in this role, and he cannot be objective: every choice he makes as to when or when not to supply a note is subjectively determined, governed entirely by the quality of his own understanding of the author's intention and by his estimation of the reader's need to be enlightened. The element of uniformity which validates Greg's rationale of copy-text and which simplifies the task of the editor is lacking here, and without it, though we may suggest certain principles and guidelines for the annotator, these cannot amount to a theoretical system that will be applicable in all cases. Let me briefly illustrate what I take to be the three chief variables affecting the annotation of any given literary work: (1) the character of the audience which the annotator supposes he is addressing; (2) the nature of the text he is annotating; and (3) the peculiar interests, competencies, and assumptions of the annotator himself. The first of these variables is surely the most obvious. Before we can proceed very far in annotating a text we must have formed some notion of the interests and capacities of those who are likely to use the edition. Will they be professional scholars in the field or undergraduates in survey courses? Though in most cases the answer to this basic question will be immediately apparent and will determine our general orientation as we set about the task of annotation, yet its implications are today rather less clear than they would have been even a generation or two ago. I suppose it can be safely assumed that undergraduates are likely to be ignorant of most matters relating to the literary, social, and intellectual history of whatever period, to say nothing of the classics and the scriptures which not very long ago were the staples of every schoolboy's education. But can we as confidently assume that our colleagues will need much less enlightenment? We, too, are increasingly the products of an educational system that has abandoned the study of Latin and Greek and the Bible for subjects more "relevant" and secular; as a consequence most of us are ill at ease within the most important frames of reference shared by the community of literate men from the Middle Ages to the nineteenth century. In these times of narrowing disciplines and increasing specialization, furthermore, few of us are equally knowledgeable about all aspects even of the historical periods in which we spend our professional lives. The literary critic who knows Gulliver's Travels intimately may well need to be informed in some detail of the political circumstances referred to in The Conduct of the Allies , and it is more than likely that he has never read a sermon by Swift or anyone else. He will probably be unable to translate for himself a passage from the Aeneid , or to identify the work or to recall the context when it has been translated for him. Freud may have acquainted him with the myths of Narcissus and Electra, but will he be just as familiar with those of Hylas and Pasiphaë? With respect to many areas of knowledge, the distance between a bright philosophy major, say, who finds himself taking a course in Renaissance literature and the professor of history who wishes to read Spenser's Faerie Queene is probably shorter than we might suppose: for different reasons they may be grateful to know that in Una, Spenser allegorizes both the platonic ideal of the One and the character and destiny of the Church of England. Though the annotator's conception of his audience will thus have a less radical effect on the process of selecting passages to gloss than might at first seem to be the case, yet it is certainly not irrelevant to this process. We may reasonably assume that the general knowledge of scholars is superior to that of undergraduates and that their command of the language is more comprehensive and more sophisticated. For this reason it has seemed to me supererogatory for the Twickenham editor of The Rape of the Lock to supply definitions of such terms as "Virago," "Termagant," and "Spark," which, one trusts, few scholars will need to be instructed in, and to gloss such other terms as "Treat," "Denizens," and "Resign'd," which, though applied by Pope in a somewhat unusual sense, may be easily found in the OED . Notes such as these in a definitive edition serve only to clutter the page and to betray the editor's pedantry, not to say his condescension toward his readers. Paradoxically, however, though scholars are generally better informed than college students, notes designed to enlighten the former will normally be fuller than those addressed to the latter. For scholars, who may be teaching the work in question or writing about it, and who are by and large a curious and skeptical lot, will not be content with a gloss that is superficial or perfunctory; they expect to be informed of the historical context that explains the author's use of a term or concept and whether his usage is conventional or novel, and before accepting an editor's assertions on trust they wish to be apprized of the evidence. Not only the decision itself to annotate or not to annotate will be affected, therefore, by our conception of an audience, but also our notion of the scope and thoroughness of any given note. Secondly, the annotator's task will vary, and quite appreciably, according to the nature of the work in question—that is, according to whether its allusive and topical texture is complicated and dense or comparatively simple and straightforward. A poem like the Dunciad , for example, poses in this respect an editorial problem that is virtually insoluble. The conscientious editor who attempts an exhaustive commentary on this richly allusive work must either fail miserably or, by succeeding, earn for himself a niche in the poem (which I like to imagine Pope revising from time to time from his vantage point in the Elysian Fields). Such an editor would be obliged not only to retain Pope's and Warburton's own copious notes (which often require commentary in their own right), but also to supplement these by sharpening the identification of the hordes of obscure scribblers imprisoned in Pope's couplets; what is more, he would have the further formidable task of locating the sources of Pope's frequent plagiarisms and paraphrases, of explaining his innumerable puns, and spotting his countless allusions to various literary, religious, and political matters. By attempting this questionable feat the notes to the Twickenham edition virtually crowd the poetry off the page, yet, even so, admirable as Professor Sutherland's commentary is, they ignore scores of allusions and at best merely hint at the range and complexity of the ambiguities in which Pope veils his "deep intent." It is generally true—as, say, Roger Lonsdale's edition of Gray, Collins, and Goldsmith will attest 7 —that the poetry of a literate age which values the pleasures of imitation will have an allusive texture of uncommon density posing for the annotator a far more exacting problem than its fiction will do. One may hope, at least, to provide all the needful commentary for Moll Flanders or Emma , but to annotate Pope's poetry is to accept from the start the necessity of compromise. I am not, of course, proposing as an axiom that all novels present simpler challenges for the annotator than all poems: Defoe's Journal of the Plague Year and Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey , to say nothing of Sterne's Tristram Shandy and Fielding's Tom Jones , are plain examples to the contrary; and I can think of no poem of any period that affords a problem for the annotator as hopelessly demanding as that posed by Ulysses and Finnegans Wake . The point is that what we may reasonably expect an annotator to undertake to elucidate in any given work will vary according to a number of factors, such as the obscurity of the contexts to which it relates—literary, intellectual, political, biographical, etc.—and the density of its allusive texture. A third variable preventing uniformity in the practice of annotation is the apparent (and, regrettably, perhaps inevitable) cause of that disconcerting subjectivity which is and has ever been the distinguishing characteristic of editorial practice and editorial reviewing. No two editors will annotate a text in the same way because each, according to his interests, competencies, and assumptions—according, indeed, to his temperament and sensibilities—will respond to the text in different ways: what to one may be obscure will be clear to another; what to one seems an allusion is to another the author's own turn of phrase; what to one seems significant about a passage may seem to another irrelevant. Such differences will obtain even among editors of comparable abilities and industry, and even if they should happen to agree on the audience they are addressing and on the nature of the annotation a specific text demands. According to his peculiar interests and competencies, an editor will see some things as happening in a text and be oblivious of others: he may be alert to every political, literary, and theatrical innuendo in the Dunciad , say, but be largely unaware of Pope's complex system of religious and philosophical allusion. In this respect the factor of subjectivity in annotation, though its distorting effects may be minimized by further study and research as the editor attempts to familiarize himself with the sources of his author's knowledge and thought, can never be eliminated and, consequently, the commentary even of a Mack or a Wasserman will be imperfect and incomplete. Literary annotation being, then, the attempt of a particular editor to mediate between a particular text and a particular kind of reader, it follows that this process is a relative thing which in certain essential respects will vary from edition to edition. For this reason, as I have said, annotation more nearly resembles an art than a science; it cannot be completely regularized or reduced to a single set of invariable principles. Yet it need not be practised in quite the anarchic way it has been. Like any other art, this one has a purpose as well as certain strategies and techniques for achieving that purpose. We ought at least to be able to agree on what we are trying to do as annotators and on how we can best go about doing it. In the remainder of this essay, by drawing on Professor Friedman's early article and on my own experience editing Fielding's novels, I will try to bring us a little closer to a consensus on these basic questions, particularly as they apply to scholarly editions of eighteenth-century literary prose. Narrow as this focus may be with respect to the historical frame of reference and the nature of the text, the results of the inquiry should not be irrelevant to the problems of other editors concerned with other kinds of texts in other periods. Though in some important respects it needs to be refined and qualified, Professor Friedman's statement of the purpose of annotation and of the two principal kinds of notes is useful. To paraphrase him, we may say that the editor in annotating a work intends to make the meaning of the text more intelligible to the reader, on the one hand by recovering for him certain information about specific persons, places, and events once known to the author's contemporaries but now obscure, and on the other hand by placing the author's ideas and expressions in the context of his own writings and those of his contemporaries. Professor Friedman calls these two kinds of notes "notes of recovery" and "explanatory notes," observing, however, that in actual practice the distinction between them often blurs. "Notes of recovery" are needed in Tom Jones , for example, when Fielding refers to acquaintances such as Richard Willoughby the lawyer (p. 458) 8 and Thomas King the coachman (p. 549); to places such as Prior Park (pp. 612-613) and Bridges Street (p. 375); and to events such as the wreck of the Victory (p. 593) and the riotous first night of Edward Moore's play, The Foundling (p. 729). Another sort of "note of recovery," implied though not specified in Professor Friedman's definition, provides information often crucial to the subtler play of meanings in a given passage: namely, the note identifying a literary allusion—such as Fielding's arch reference, interrupting his ostentatiously eloquent introduction of his heroine, to "the rude Answer which Lord Rochester once gave to a Man, who had seen many Things" (pp. 155-156); or his having Sophy reveal her distress at a scene in Southerne's Fatal Marriage which closely resembles her own unhappy situation (p. 796). And of course "notes of recovery" will also be required whenever it is likely that an author's language will be obscure to most readers, as when Fielding's surgeon wishes to subject Jones to "a Revulsion" (p. 411), or when Jones supposes that Partridge must be good "at capping Verses" (p. 414). Most editors will readily recognize the need to supply such information as this. Even so, as I will show presently, there is considerable disagreement about the fullness of treatment appropriate to certain kinds of "notes of recovery" whose function at first glance would seem to be quite straightforward. Much more problematical are the decisions relating to what Professor Friedman calls "explanatory notes." It is not always easy to distinguish in a text those ideas and expressions which require commentary from those which do not, and here, especially, an editor's judgment and powers of discrimination are tested. In editing Tom Jones , for example, I glossed rather fully Fielding's use of such concepts as "Good-nature" (p. 39) and "Prudence" (p. 36), because I am personally convinced that a modern reader cannot adequately appreciate Fielding's characterization and moral purpose in that novel unless he is apprized of the personal and historical contexts which deepen our sense of the significance of these ideas to Fielding and his first readers, and which enable us to estimate the degree of originality apparent in Fielding's treatment of them. Another editor, unconvinced of the importance of the ideas, would leave them unexplained, or treat them in a cursory way. The question of scope —of how full our commentary should be and of what kinds of information it should contain—must be faced in any sort of annotation; but the vaguer, more subjective question of relevance is particularly vexing as the editor tries to determine whether or not a note of the "explanatory" kind is needed. With respect to frequency and fullness, the character of the notes in any edition will be determined by how the editor answers these two questions. Indeed, the all too apparent anarchy of modern annotative practice—the aspect of contemporary scholarly editing in which, with reference to the commentary, individual editions range themselves (as we have remarked) along a broad spectrum defined by the antithetical practice of the Yale Milton and Herbert Davis's Swift—is chiefly to be accounted for in this way. Must this confusion continue? Is the business of annotation really such a relative and subjective enterprise that any editor's notions of scope and relevancy are as valid as any other's? I think not. The trouble has been that, though most editors can agree that the purpose of annotation is "to make the meaning of the text intelligible to the reader," individually they have construed that definition in very different ways. In practice we have been unable to agree on what constitutes "the meaning of the text" or on the procedure required to make that meaning "intelligible to the reader." This disagreement is curious since, as linguists from Richards to the present have demonstrated, the meaning of a text—and particularly of a literary text—is not limited to the strict denotative or referential signification of its language, but includes as well the connotative values of that language, the full range of associations which the words had for the author and his first readers. Though it is true that we can never hope wholly to recover the meanings of a text in this sense, it is also true that an editor who has given some years of his life to studying his author and the historical context in which he wrote is most likely to be aware of them, and that, whenever in his judgment the text may be obscure, he has a responsibility to share his knowledge and understanding with the reader by providing whatever information may be necessary to make the author's meaning intelligible. In this view, even a "note of recovery"—the neater and more straight-forward of the two kinds Professor Friedman has defined—will often require fuller treatment than we might suppose. It will of course serve the basic function of identifying person, place, event, or literary allusion; but it must frequently do more than this. In Tom Jones , for example, Fielding several times compliments Ralph Allen, referring to his friend's benevolence (p. 4), to his being both esteemed and condescended to by Pope (pp. 6, 404), to his having built hospitals (p. 38), to his intelligence, wealth, business activities, as well as his taste, hospitality, and personal integrity (pp. 403-404), to his estate (pp. 612-613). Clearly, no note which in a sentence records his dates and characterizes him as a philanthropist and patron of letters will adequately identify Allen for the reader of the novel; the editor must also illuminate the specific aspects of Allen's life and character which comprise the substance of Fielding's various compliments, for that is Allen's meaning in the text. Similarly, when Fielding mentions "the well-wooded Forest of Hampshire " and troubles to add a rare footnote of his own implying that it has been stripped of its trees (p. 259 and n.), the editor will oblige the reader by identifying the place as the New Forest; but he will oblige him more by explaining the particular historical circumstance to which Fielding refers, and still more by supplying the biographical information which in all probability accounts for the occurrence and prominence of the allusion in the novel: namely, that the Duke of Bedford, Fielding's patron and Warden of the New Forest, had appointed him its High Steward in 1748. 9 What the reader wishes to know, in other words, is the author's use of an allusion, why he chose to make the reference and how it works in the text. To supply the reader with the information he requires in order to know the text this intimately is the function of any note, but the problem of recovery is often especially complex in annotating works of fiction and poetry, in which literary allusions are generally a principal device of the author for complicating, deepening, and extending the denotative sense of a passage. A proper note on such an allusion will not only identify the author and the work quoted, but will briefly point out those features of the context and circumstances of the passage quoted that serve to clarify whatever analogy or irony may be latent in the allusion Consider, for example, the following allusion occurring in Fielding's celebrated discussion of conservation of character, an aspect of the principle of Probability he is recommending to fellow novelists: It is admirably remarked by a most excellent Writer, That Zeal can no more hurry a Man to act in direct Opposition to itself, than a rapid Stream can carry a Boat against its own Current. I will venture to say, that for a Man to act in direct Contradiction to the Dictates of his Nature, is, if not impossible, as improbable and as miraculous as any Thing which can well be conceived. Should the best Parts of the Story of Marcus Antoninus be ascribed to Nero , or should the worst Incidents of Nero's Life be imputed to Antoninus , what would be more shocking to Belief than either Instance. . . . (pp. 405-06) The editor annotating the allusion in the opening sentence of this passage will of course state that Fielding is here recalling a remark of George Lyttelton's in his Observations on the Conversion and Apostleship of St. Paul (1747); and, since Fielding is paraphrasing rather than giving Lyttelton's exact words, he should probably quote the passage so as to enable the reader to judge for himself how Fielding alters the original. Having done this much, the editor yet has not helped the reader to grasp how the allusion works ; in itself the passage Fielding paraphrases is a simple generalization about human nature. In context, however, the aphorism summarizes Lyttelton's crucial argument to prove that St. Paul's sudden conversion, from being the persecutor of Christians to being an apostle of Christ, was a true and genuine miracle, not to be explained by natural causes alone. By clarifying this context, the editor will enable the reader to respond to the specifically religious resonances of the word "miraculous" in Fielding's second sentence and of the phrase "shocking to Belief" in his third; and he will enable him to see that, implicit in the allusion, is a specific example of Fielding's point: though the authors of divine history may concern themselves with the Marvellous, the province of the novelist is the Probable. In his own life St. Paul was a greater contradiction than what Fielding next imagines would occur if an historian confused the characters of Nero and Marcus Aurelius. The allusion, moreover, works in a more personal way as well, serving as another of Fielding's compliments to Lyttelton, his friend and patron, to whom he dedicated Tom Jones and who stood with Ralph Allen as a model for Squire Allworthy. Since this biographical context will have been described in an earlier note, the editor may by a cross-reference direct the reader to this information. But, while enhancing the sense we already have of Lyttelton's goodness as a man (he is, we are reminded, the pious author of Christian apologetics), the present allusion contributes a new dimension to Fielding's praise of his friend, who is now complimented specifically for his excellence as a writer. By adducing similar compliments from Fielding's other works, the editor may also wish to assure us of Fielding's sincerity in admiring this less obvious virtue in his friend. And finally, in another cross-reference, he may wish to direct us to a later instance in the novel in which Fielding again alludes to the work quoted here. 10 In short, the meaning of an allusion such as this—the full range of its associations and resonances—is complex. To render that meaning intelligible to the reader, the editor must recover for him the several elements which constitute it in all its complexity. Those elements will certainly include the identity of the author and work alluded to, but they will also include a knowledge of context, of historical and biographical circumstances, and of the occurrence of the same allusion or of similar ones elsewhere in the author's writings; for only when the reader is apprized of these latter kinds of information will he understand what the allusion meant to the author, why he chose to introduce it at the particular place in the text where it occurs, and how it works there. Unless in such exceptional cases as I discussed earlier—cases, such as the Dunciad , where the extreme density of a work's allusive texture obliges us to compromise with this ideal—the literary editor who undertakes to annotate a text in a scholarly edition must accept his responsibility to recover all these elements for the reader. This responsibility, let me hasten to add, should not be construed as a license to display everything he knows about the topic; a note should not be, as George Sherburn once remarked, a sort of wastebasket into which the editor may conveniently dump the accumulated debris of his filing cabinet. This self-indulgent practice—the impulse "to tell all that they have learned rather than what readers need to know"—is what James Thorpe (p. 199) rightly deplores as the "occupational disease of editors." The ideal note is that which supplies essential information only and in the briefest compass possible. It does not of course follow that such a note will be short: since meaning can be complex, to supply the reader with even the essential elements that will enable him to recover it in all its complexity will frequently require a certain amplitude (in the Wesleyan Edition the note to the passage analyzed above takes up fourteen lines of print). But it will be as brief as the editor can make it, its brevity being measured by how well he has distilled the essential matter from the mass of potentially relevant information at his disposal. Far from encouraging self-indulgence, the making of a proper note requires of the editor a discipline and restraint that can be painful, for it demands of him the nicest discrimination in selecting his material and the most rigorous polishing of his own exposition. Nor should a note, ideally, offer the editor an opportunity for self-indulgence in another sense. Though he is responsible for supplying essential information, he should strive to avoid imposing on the reader his own interpretation of a passage. His aim is to make the act of criticism possible, not to perform it. The editor's lack of restraint in this regard is what Professor Schoenbaum deplores as "having a free ride at the expense of a captive audience . . . ." Regrettably, however, by making available the elements out of which the reader may construct his own interpretation of the text, the editor to some extent will unavoidably control his reader's understanding of the text. For to identify the pieces of a puzzle and to arrange them in order, as rational discourse requires, is not only to define the nature of the puzzle but to suggest how the pieces should be assembled. One distinguished reviewer of the Wesleyan Tom Jones lamented this consequence of the rationale of literary annotation I am here proposing and which I have tried to apply in my own practice. The reviewer, Professor Middendorf, observed that, though the aim of the Wesleyan editors is not to interpret their texts, yet "in giving necessary background information and explaining 18th-century—and Fielding's—political and religious preoccupations in their introductions and notes, [the] editors open up their texts in ways that suggest and even occasionally establish judgments and evaluations." He continues in this "gloomy" vein by asking: "Once quotations are traced and names, places, events identified, how does one decide what deserves a note, what doesn't? Obviously the editor's interests and previous knowledge come into play, and though these may be, as here, of the most responsible and wide-ranging sort, may they not also, especially in an imposing edition like this, forestall fresh responses and invite an end to debate?" 11 This is not, certainly, a captious criticism of the difficulty—indeed, I would agree with Professor Middendorf in calling it the "impossibility"—of perfectly reconciling the editor's responsibility to supply essential information with his wish to be as objective and unobtrusive as possible in doing so. As I have observed, the process of annotation is the process by which an individual scholar with certain personal interests and certain personal kinds of competencies mediates between a particular text and a particular kind of reader. That he should be entirely objective and self-effacing in performing this function is a happiness unobtainable by the very nature of the art. Try as he may not to do so, the editor cannot help governing, to some degree, the reader's response to the text. But the gloom this dilemma inspires need not be quite so oppressive as it seems to Professor Middendorf. As a reader myself of scholarly editions, far from resenting I have been grateful for the opportunity a good set of notes provides to share the editor's insights into the text and his knowledge of its contexts and circumstances—to share, that is, his informed personal response to the text based on a consideration of its meanings more prolonged and intensive than my own could be. Though it is true, furthermore, that the interpretations suggested in the notes to a definitive edition carry the stamp of authority, need we really be quite so apprehensive that the readers of such an edition, who are for the most part teachers and scholars and critics, cannot be trusted to judge for themselves the validity and usefulness of these interpretations? A scholarly edition is addressed to the most sophisticated audience imaginable; its readers may be supposed, I think, to accept or reject what is offered them according to their sense of its accuracy and cogency. Anxious as he understandably is to keep to a minimum editorial interference in the reading process, Middendorf, I suspect, would prefer Friedman's spare and extremely conservative manner of annotating Goldsmith to Donald Bond's more liberal practice in his edition of The Spectator ; and surely Friedman's modesty and self-restraint as an editor are admirable. But knowing how brilliantly, after so many years of study, he might have illuminated his author for us, many have thought these virtues achieved at too great a sacrifice. Though I have so far illustrated the purpose and nature of literary annotation chiefly by reference to "notes of recovery," these same principles apply equally to notes of the "explanatory" kind, which must also supply the reader with essential information only and in the briefest compass possible. Here, however, as I have remarked, the task of the editor defines itself less neatly: it is generally speaking simple enough to recognize those allusions to persons, places, events, or literary works that need clarifying; it is not so simple to decide which of an author's ideas or expressions need to be rendered more intelligible by placing them in context. Such decisions will of course be easier to make the better an editor knows his author and the historical and intellectual milieu that influenced his thought, for he will then be better able to tell when the author is using concepts that carried a special significance for him and his first readers of which a modern audience may be unaware. Ideas such as "Prudence" (p. 36) or "Good-nature" (p. 39), the dramatic unities (p. 209) or the chain of being (p. 481), the double standard in sexual matters (p. 755) or the reputation of the Dutch for cowardice (p. 513) had meanings for Fielding and his contemporaries which in the course of time either have been lost entirely, or have been modified to the point where some explanation is required to restore them to their original contexts. Notes such as these are particularly difficult to write, however, since the topics in question—often implying the basic assumptions and representative ideas of an entire culture—invite a copiousness of treatment that the editor must try to resist. Essays, indeed monographs, have been written on such subjects; but the editor, whose medium might be thought the sonnet form of scholarship, must distill an adequate sense of them as efficiently as possible. Here especially his powers of discrimination and his sense of proportion will be tested. Having discussed the general principles governing the purpose of literary annotation, let us consider more practical matters of procedure—a subject on which Professor Friedman's pioneering article is particularly judicious and helpful. With some slight qualification Friedman's insistence that illustrative evidence used in annotation must not be "drawn from writings later than the one being edited" (p. 119) should be regarded as axiomatic. The editor in a note is trying to reconstruct for the reader those original elements which informed the author's intention, who, as he wrote the passage in question, cannot have been acquainted with the fruits of modern scholarship or, for that matter, with any sources of information published later than the period in which he composed the work. Friedman's formulation of this primary axiom of annotation is, however, rather too strict. The meanings a given allusion or idea has for an author do not cease to exist at the moment his work is published; they may continue to live in his thoughts and therefore may find expression in his later works in ways that can illuminate the passage we are annotating. This same persistence of meaning, moreover, is just as obviously a feature of the historical context in which the work was written. In attempting to recreate meanings for his reader the editor should actually confine himself to considering the useful life of the idea in question. All things being equal, he will prefer to adduce illustrative evidence from earlier sources (not much earlier, of course: since, as the very purpose of annotation suggests, meanings change over the course of time, we will generally wish to annotate an author by reference to writings and ideas more or less contemporary with him). Lacking such earlier sources—or, for that matter, lacking earlier sources which will illuminate a passage as effectively as some later source—the editor may reasonably look ahead to find his evidence. The closer such evidence is to the time of composition of the passage, the more persuasive it will be; and in any event we must not range beyond the immediate historical and personal contexts which define the life of the idea. Some latitude in this matter is admissible. In annotating the passage in The Champion (12 February 1739/40) in which Fielding commends Samuel Boyse's poem, Deity , for example, the editor of that journal will certainly wish to cite the almost identical compliment in Tom Jones (VII. i), published nine years later. Or in glossing Fielding's attitude toward duelling implicit in Jones's reluctance to fight Northerton (pp. 383-384), we will not fail to mention the much fuller and more explicit condemnation of this practice in Amelia (1751) and The Covent-Garden Journal (14 January 1752). Indeed, the best sources I could find to illustrate the specific nature of Fielding's comments on The Bull's Head Inn at Meriden (p. 574) or on "Beau" Nash's reputation as self-appointed guardian of the young ladies at Bath (p. 585) were books published, respectively, in 1757 and 1761, several years after the novelist's death. Friedman's second axiom concerns the focussing of a note: "the editor," he asserts, "should annotate only what his author has to say about a subject, not the whole subject and everything connected with it" (p. 119). As a general principle this, of course, is perfectly sound, since the purpose of any note, as we have been insisting all along, is not to indulge the editor in displaying the full range of his erudition, but to clarify the author's specific meaning and intention. When annotating Fielding's representation of conditions in Newgate Prison in Amelia (I. iii), for example, we should focus on those particular features of the subject which illuminate the corresponding circumstances of the narrative; we should not rehearse the entire history of the prison or stray into a sociological survey of English penal reform. In actual practice, however, this axiom also requires a certain latitude of interpretation that Friedman, if we consider the conservative character of his notes to the Goldsmith edition, seems not to have intended. For, as I earlier remarked, what an author has to say about a subject can often be adequately understood only if the reader is apprized of the historical contexts and circumstances affecting it. Implicit in what Fielding in Tom Jones has to say—often in rather elliptical and oblique ways—about such subjects as "Prudence" (p. 36 and passim), the aesthetic principle of contrast (p. 212), or the polity of the gypsies (p. 666) are a whole range of complex historical associations which, once we are aware of them, significantly deepen our sense of the author's quality of thought, of how conventional or original he may be in his treatment of a subject. Friedman's next two caveats are, one hopes, too patently just to require further comment. The editor, he insists, must be precise in distinguishing from among several possible contexts the particular frame of reference implied in his author's treatment of an idea; and he must be scrupulous enough not to mislead the reader by setting up "false parallels" between the passage he is annotating and those adduced to illustrate it (pp. 120-121). Errors of discrimination this fundamental are obviously irresponsible; indeed, they are in a sense unethical, since the editor who commits them is abusing the reader's trust. From Friedman's analysis two further axioms may be drawn respecting the kinds of cogency to be achieved in explanatory annotations. I have some slight reservations about the general usefulness of the first of these, which seems to confuse the advantage of identifying the specific source of an idea or expression with what seems to me the greater and rather different virtue of illuminating the author's thought; the second principle, however, constitutes a cardinal rule for effective annotation. Friedman thus offers the following definition: We may, I think, set it down as a principle that the most convincing explanatory notes are those in which unmistakable plagiarism from earlier writings is shown, for in such cases we have the unique elements out of which the author has constructed parts of his text. If this is true, it follows that other notes (at least notes that are intended to show similarity, not difference—that is, that reveal the author following a tradition of thought or expression, not departing from it) will be convincing and enlightening to the extent that the parallels pointed out approach plagiarism (pp. 121-122). No doubt the most "convincing" note is one which demonstrates an author's verbatim borrowing from a particular source, since in this instance the reader can have no suspicion that the correspondence proposed is the product of mere coincidence or of the editor's fancy. And there is always a heady thrill in catching a writer in the act of pilfering. Few authors, however, are such irrepressible plagiarists as Goldsmith, on whose example Friedman chiefly bases his analysis. For the most part, an editor cannot expect to find a specific source for his author's ideas; indeed, to set about the task of annotation assuming that the only proper and successful note is one that demonstrates a plagiarism—as Friedman, following this axiom, seems to have done in editing Goldsmith—is to achieve cogency at the expense of other, no less useful kinds of illumination. Rather, the editor must be alert to more general correspondencies, to echoes from various works that approximate the phrasing of the text. He must have a good memory, certainly, so that he "hears" the text as he conducts his research; but he must also rely on his judgment to distinguish the viable context of his author's thought. The note that supplies this context, though it may be somewhat less "convincing," will often be more "enlightening" than one which merely records a plagiarism; for it will inform the reader not only of what the author read, but of how he read—how he was influenced, whether positively or negatively, by the vital currents of thought of his time. For this reason Friedman's next axiom, which addresses itself to the usefulness of this latter kind of note and to the most effective method of proceeding in such annotation, is especially valuable. Friedman here rightly insists that when attempting to reconstruct the viable contexts of an author's thought, the editor will be more convincing when the parallels he adduces are drawn from sources more or less contemporary with the work being annotated. Correspondences between an author's ideas and those expressed in works published, say, a hundred years earlier are likely to seem merely fortuitous, whereas the same correspondences occurring in several works published within a few years of each other probably derive from a common current of thought. Thus, in Friedman's model, Louis Landa shed much light on Swift's "Sermon upon the Martyrdom of K. Charles I" by demonstrating numerous parallels between Swift's topics and rhetorical strategies and those of many other thirtieth-of-January sermons. The point, of course, will not be that the author actually read all or indeed any of these contemporary documents, but that, in Friedman's words, the work "is in many ways explained by being thus related to its historical background" (p. 123). More than the identification of outright plagiarisms—which is seldom possible—the definition of such relationships between text and context is one of the most valuable services an editor can perform. I would, however, again insist on a somewhat more liberal construction of the principle than Friedman's statement allows. What constitutes the contemporaneity of a parallel passage—and therefore its potential validity as an element in the editor's commentary on the text—is defined only in part by the proximity of its actual date of publication to the period of the text's composition. Fundamentally, of course, the contemporaneity of such a passage is determined by its currency during the period of composition. In this sense Hamlet and Paradise Lost , say, are no less contemporary with Tom Jones than Moore's The Foundling or Boyse's Deity ; and, as Fielding himself makes clear, the sermons of the seventeenth-century divines Isaac Barrow and John Tillotson influenced his thought to an even greater degree than the works of Bishop Hoadly. At the risk of belaboring a point I have already insisted on, I wish to conclude this review of Friedman's useful article by heartily endorsing a principle which, though applied in his final remarks to the making of "notes of recovery" only, should in fact be applied to the procedure of annotation in general: "namely, that as far as possible [an editor's notes] should be derived from contemporary sources rather than from modern reference books" (p. 125). The editor who takes this advice stands a far better chance of being able to illustrate the precise nuances of meaning a particular topic had for the author and his first readers. If it were not so apparent that many editors are unaware of the most obvious of these contemporary sources—namely, the journalism of the period—it would seem impertinent to add that the first step toward recovering information of this kind should be the conscientious perusal of at least those newspapers and magazines published during the period of the work's composition. By studying not only the "leaders," but also the news items and advertisements contained in such documents, the editor will come as close as possible to recreating in his own mind the daily circumstances in which his author wrote and to which he sometimes alludes in his writings. By analyzing the advertisements and monthly catalogues of works published during this period, moreover, and by tracking down and examining as many of these works as possible, the editor will often discover in even the fugitive literature of the time patterns of thought and allusion that illuminate his text in unexpected ways. From such hints couched in contemporary news items and advertisements, for example, I was able to deduce the personal circumstances underlying the episode of the puppet show in Tom Jones (XII. v—vi), and to identify Fielding's cryptic allusion in Amelia (I. ii) to "the celebrated Writer of three Letters" as a reference to Bolingbroke. Let me conclude by proposing, in summary form, the following definitions of the purpose and nature of literary annotation, together with some recommendations concerning basic procedures for the annotator. I have in mind specifically, of course, as I trust will be clear by now, the typical case of a scholarly edition of an eighteenth-century literary text of unexceptional allusive density; but perhaps other editors in other fields will find at least some of these principles helpful in their own tasks. The purpose of literary annotation, whether of "explanatory notes" or "notes of recovery," is to recover for the reader, as briefly and objectively as possible, all essential information (and only essential information) necessary to render the author's meaning wholly intelligible, the "author's meaning" being understood as not only the primary denotative significance of a passage but also, when appropriate, its full range of implicit associations, whether biographical, historical, or literary. To achieve this purpose an effective note will serve one or more of four functions: (1) it may define obscure terms or provide translations of words and passages in a foreign language; (2) it may identify persons, places, events, and literary allusions, supplying the reader, when appropriate, with such additional contextual information as he needs to appreciate how the reference "works" in the text; (3) it may illuminate the author's ideas or expressions either by citing specific sources for them or by adducing parallel passages from contemporary writings; and (4) it will record, whenever they seem significant, parallel or contradictory passages from the author's other works, as well as indicating such passages by cross-references as they occur elsewhere in the text itself. Since the aim of annotation is to reconstruct what a passage meant to the author and his first readers, all such information should be drawn as far as possible from contemporary sources rather than from modern reference books. Assuming of course that he already has a sound general knowledge of his subject—that he is well acquainted with his author's life, works, and times and has carefully read the text in question—I recommend that the scholarly editor who undertakes to annotate a literary work according to these principles proceed as follows: (1) He should first establish the text by collation of all editions published during the author's lifetime, observing as he does such unusual typographical features in the first edition especially as may signal the occurrence of a topical reference or literary allusion and noticing as well those substantive revisions which may require explanation. (2) On the basis of external and internal evidence he should define the period of composition of the work, for by so doing he will define the chronological scope of his most intensive research in contemporary sources. (3) Having defined the period of composition, he should inform himself in depth of the circumstances in which the author wrote—of his activities, residences, and acquaintances, and of the historical and intellectual events that may have mattered to him. As the surest means to this end, he will of course read through the author's correspondence and other personal papers when they are available. And he should conscientiously examine the newspapers and magazines issued during this period, thus familiarizing himself with its daily history and current topics of interest, and enabling him to identify books, poems, and pamphlets which his author may have read. (4) He should also extend these investigations into the period immediately following the publication of the work in order to acquaint himself with its early reception as reflected in reviews, letters, etc. In this way not only will he be able to judge the initial general response to the work, but he will also often recover some of the specific meanings the work had for the author's contemporaries. (5) With the text in all its detail firmly in mind, he should reread the author's other writings, keeping alert for parallel or contradictory passages. Since this review of the canon will often result in the identification of obscure references in the text which the author has treated elsewhere more explicitly, it should be undertaken at an early stage of the editor's research, though not before he has performed the basic task of establishing the text. (6) He should then conduct his remaining research by consulting contemporary sources whenever possible, so as to acquaint himself with the specific meanings and connotations an allusion or an idea may have had for the author and his first readers. (7)Finally, since the identification of some references will generally elude even the most conscientious research, he may wish as a last resort to appeal for help to the community of scholars by publishing a list of queries in appropriate places. (Almost, it may seem, as a vindication of Fielding's belief in a providential universe, three such queries which I published in the TLS were answered by three letters, two from German classicists and one from a Canadian scholar, each addressing himself to and identifying a separate allusion!) The editor who observes these procedures conscientiously will have done what he can to fulfill his responsibility as a mediator between the text and his reader. The thought and spirit of an era being evanescent things and scholars being mortal, he will not of course succeed in illuminating all the dark corners of the work. Too often after the effort to track down an allusion he will find himself having to confess his uncertainty, introducing notes that can claim to be nothing more than guesswork with those, to him, most pitiable of adverbs, "probably" and "possibly"; or declaring his utter helplessness in that still more humiliating phrase—"Not identified." Annotating a topical and complex work from another time can be as arduous a task as writing a proper scholarly book of one's own, and there are no convenient dodges available to an editor, who cannot control his subject as he pleases but must answer, as it were, every question on the examination. In this business the demands and frustrations will sometimes be enough to tempt him to apply to his author what Harry Thunder declares of Rover in the play: "I don't know a pleasanter fellow, except when he gets to his abominable habit of quotation." 12 Even so, the editor has his compensation; for if his author is worth knowing, few will have come to know him better.</field>

G. E. Ayscough [1774], p. 316). In context this is Lyttelton's crucial argument to prove that St. Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus was a true miracle and, consequently, that Christianity itself is a divine revelation: since, Lyttelton maintains, Paul set out on his journey not only disbelieving the Christian faith but intending to persecute its followers, his sudden transformation from infidel to believer cannot be explained by reference to natural causes.

      <field name="heading_text">Recent Editorial Discussion and the Central Questions of Editing by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The late 1970s were an extraordinarily active and interesting period for those concerned with editorial matters. In addition to the continuing stream of scholarly editions, these years saw the beginning (1976) of a Center for Scholarly Editions (CSE) within the Modern Language Association of America, the inauguration of an Association for Documentary Editing (1978) and of an interdisciplinary and international Society for Textual Scholarship (1979), and the founding (1979) of a nonprofit corporation, Literary Classics of the United States, Inc., for publishing reliable texts in a form easily accessible to the general reading public. What these organizations have in common, aside from their interest in editing, is a breadth of vision. The fact that the CSE is the successor to the Center for Editions of American Authors (CEAA) is symbolic: whereas the CEAA was limited to the consideration of editing projects in American literature, the CSE is prepared to consult with editors of any kind of material from any country; in its 1977 Introductory Statement 1 it emphasized that editors of diverse works "have a common ground for coming together" and pledged "to promote greater understanding among editors in all fields." The Association for Documentary Editing—though the original impetus for its organization came from historians editing the papers of statesmen—welcomes as members editors from all disciplines, and editors of literary and philosophical works have been active in it. 2 Similarly, Literary Classics of the United States, although it is committed to publishing works that can be regarded as American, is not limiting its purview to works that are "literary" in a narrow sense, and it recognizes that a responsible textual policy can accommodate itself to a variety of kinds of editions. 3 This climate of openness and cooperation is highly desirable; but its increasing presence should not be taken as a sign that the editorial issues argued about with considerable vehemence during the previous fifteen years have been settled. The familiar debates—such as whether Greg's rationale is appropriate for post-Renaissance material or whether the CEAA was too rigid in its standards—have continued and have often been as ill-informed as before. It would be wrong to suggest that the late 1970s did not have their share of unpleasant and fruitless editorial controversy. But I think it can also be said that the discussion began to take on a somewhat different aspect during these years: arguments based essentially on emotional reactions did not as often hold center stage, and somewhat more commentary appeared that raised thoughtful questions about central issues. Tom Davis, in an important review of the CEAA enterprise, 4 was being overly generous when he referred to "the sophistication of the scholarly debate" that the CEAA editions generated; but there is no doubt about the sophistication of his own piece, and it is a prime example of the newer, more serious criticism of the CEAA. When in 1975 I surveyed the editorial literature that had grown up around the CEAA, 5 I noted that much of it seemed to have arisen from conflicts of personality or temperament. Quantitatively these writings may have served a purpose, directing more attention than is customary to the activity of scholarly editing (though also reinforcing the view that editors are a contentious lot); but qualitatively this literature left much to be desired. The time now seeems appropriate to extend the survey through the remainder of the 1970s, not only to continue the record (for the development of the debate is of interest in its own right as an episode in the history of modern scholarship) but also to see if an examination of this literature cannot serve to identify and clarify certain basic issues of editing. Some of the pieces require little attention, for they are simply restatements of points of view that I have commented on in the earlier survey; but others, even if they are sometimes inept or illogical, touch on fundamental questions that are worth exploring further. The process of working through these discussions can, I trust, prove to be a fruitful way of approaching those questions. Although the specific subjects are frequently the CEAA or Greg's rationale, the issues obviously go beyond American literature and Greg; many misunderstandings have come about through a failure at the outset to be clear about what these underlying issues are, through a failure to make certain elementary distinctions. One of the unfortunate effects of a protracted controversy can be to envelop the issues with a greater aura of mysterious complexity than they actually possess. Editors have difficult enough decisions to make in the process of producing critical editions without needlessly complicating the conceptual framework within which their activity must take place: deciding between two variant readings, for instance, may indeed be a complex affair, requiring an involved discussion, but explaining what one hopes to accomplish by making such decisions should not be a difficult task. A look at some recent editorial discussions can lead, I think, to a realization of how simply the basic questions can be framed. 6</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The additions during 1974 and 1975 to the debate inspired by the CEAA editions contribute little that pushes forward one's understanding and do not require any extended consideration. They are of some interest, however, in illustrating how the misconceptions and misunderstandings of the earlier discussions continue to appear and how in fact certain ill-considered arguments become almost stock responses, destined to come up whenever the CEAA is mentioned. Morse Peckham, for instance, delivered a curious paper on "The Editing of 19th-Century Texts" at a symposium on "The Nature of Linguistic Evidence" at the University of Michigan in March 1974. 7 This paper is partly concerned with repeating certain ideas in his 1971 essay, "Reflections on the Foundations of Modern Textual Editing," 8 such as the view that "an author correcting his own work has the same relation to the text that an editor has" (p. 124). That earlier essay deserves serious attention for its analysis of the nature of written communication, but the aspect of it repeated here—and repeated without any new supporting arguments—is the weakest part of the whole. What the more recent paper emphasizes, however, is the "randomness" in verbal behavior and textual transmission and the problem such randomness poses for editors. 9 Because of the possibilities for variation at every stage of the transmissional process and because of the dispersal of the evidence through hundreds or thousands of copies of individual impressions of printed editions, editors cannot—as Peckham correctly observes—be in a position to know when they have seen all the evidence. But this situation need not fill one with the degree of pessimism that Peckham exhibits; his reaction is seemingly colored by his own dissatisfaction with and resignation from the Ohio University Browning edition, an event that occurred a few months before his paper and that is alluded to in it. 10 He is right to suggest that a more sophisticated statistical approach be taken to the search for variants in nineteenth-century books; but to regard CEAA texts as failures because of what he calls a "policy" of collating 11 only five or six copies of individual editions (p. 133), or to conclude that "reliable editions cannot be created" (p. 142), is to overreact to the unfortunate truth that inductive investigations are never certainly "final." To be sure, some CEAA editors have from time to time been guilty of exaggerated rhetoric, and presumably that is what Peckham is referring to when he speaks of "unjustified claims about completeness or definitiveness" and describes editors "boasting what a superb and thorough-going job they have done" (p. 136); but those editors at the same time have normally been careful to put on record just what their research consisted of and surely did not fail to understand that additional information might later turn up that would alter their conclusions. When Peckham says at the end that "the current way of making editions creates a closed or dead-end situation which requires that the effort be repeated, and must fail again," his use of the word "fail" suggests that a work is not successful if it is superseded. But of course the accumulation of knowledge proceeds precisely by building on what went before, and it is naïve to think of scholarship in terms of finality. 12 There is no question that some editors are more thorough than others in their procedures, and much of what Peckham says about the importance of recognizing the human element in printing and the need for more awareness of statistical procedures in analytical bibliography is well taken. But his insistence on attacking the supposed claims of definitiveness in CEAA editions only serves to confuse the issues and weakens what could have become a helpful positive statement about the responsible handling of evidence. This is not the first, nor the last, time that the issue of the "definitiveness" of CEAA editions has diverted attention from more basic and substantial concerns. 13 Peckham's paper—valedictory since he announces in it his resignation from the Browning edition—can be paired with another valedictory essay of the same year, Paul Baender's "Reflections upon the CEAA by a Departing Editor." 14 Baender in fact comments on Peckham's paper and makes an effective rejoinder to parts of it (see pp. 136-139). Although Baender is a "departing editor" (from the University of California Press edition of Mark Twain) because he finds himself not temperamentally suited to editorial work, he believes that the CEAA editions are "eminently worth doing" (p. 141) and places in proper perspective some of the superficial criticisms they have received. In the light of his effective exposure of certain "clichés" that continually turn up in writings critical of the CEAA, 15 it is surprising that his own criticisms also include some arguments that are clichés. For example, he objects to the "trivialities" and "excesses of trivia" that he finds recorded in some CEAA editions and suggests that if people had "taken the outrage of Mumford and Wilson seriously" the proliferation of "meaningless data" would not have occurred (p. 135). 16 To protest about the quantity of data recorded in CEAA editions has certainly become one of the clichés of criticism. But it is difficult to fathom why people become so incensed over the presence of information they do not find of use. Perhaps some editors are overly generous in supplying evidence they have considered in the process of preparing an edition; but readers who are not interested in the information are free to ignore it. Criticizing an edition for containing too much so-called "trivial" information is itself a trivial complaint. Baender views this criticism more sensibly later when he says that "pedantic excesses" are "relatively minor concomitants of the editorial process" (pp. 143-144)—but at the same time he unexpectedly admits, "I too find little importance in word-division lists." These lists have been a favorite target for unreflective critics, but it is hard to see how anyone who has been involved in establishing a text could fail to understand their significance. I do not suppose that any editor regards them as particularly appealing, but editors nevertheless recognize that these lists play an essential role in the task that an edition aims to accomplish: when an editor has taken pains to establish a text—punctuation as well as words—it is illogical not to inform readers about which line-end hyphens should be retained in making quotations from the text. Baender's essay in other respects, as in this one, does not advance the frontiers of editorial debate; but some of the questions he raises should perhaps be enumerated as further examples of his own category of "clichés." For instance, he blames the CEAA inspectors for some of the "trivia" in the published editions, noting with apparent distaste that "Generally the inspectors are greatly concerned with accidentals" (p. 135) and referring to "the inspectors' nitpicking" that causes editors "to worry over the details of their textual descriptions" (p. 136). Though some inspectors have doubtless been guilty of excesses, to regard the questioning of details as "nitpicking" suggests a lack of sympathy with the kind of attention to detail that scholarly editing necessarily involves. 17 Of more substance is Baender's dissatisfaction with the term "final intention"; but his brief discussion is no more than a gesture, for he ignores the interesting aspects of the question by taking "final" to mean "last," without regard to motive (he claims that if certain of Mark Twain's revisions of The Innocents Abroad for the Routledge edition are rejected as adaptations for a British audience, "the criterion of final textual intention has been compromised" [p. 140]). On another important aspect of intention—the relation to authorial intention of revisions dictated by the publisher—he makes an admirable statement ("an individual has the power and privilege of self-expression and of changing his mind," and "other individuals do not have the privilege of altering that self-expression or of forcing that change of mind"); but when he adds, "I believe the CEAA has not sufficiently recognized that a writer's acquiescence in his publisher's alterations may also be construed as self-expression" (p. 141), he raises—but does not explore—what has become one of the most ubiquitous issues in discussions of modern editing. Baender's piece is essentially thoughtful, and for that reason certain stock reactions to the CEAA stand out in it all the more flagrantly; their presence in such an essay suggests how pervasive they have become. Another paper of 1974 written by a person generally sympathetic to the CEAA but at the same time exhibiting superficial criticisms of it is Joseph Katz's paper for the November 1974 Toronto Conference on Editorial Problems. Its title announces that Katz's theme is the endlessly asserted "rigidity" of CEAA policy: "'Novelists of the Future': Animadversions against the Rigidity of Current Theory in the Editing of Nineteenth-Century American Writers." 18 Katz offers a useful discussion of some of the textual problems in editing Frank Norris; but when he tries to show that these problems "strain a strict application of current editorial approach" (p. 69), he resorts to several of the old clichés. He is particularly concerned about the notion of a "definitive" edition, asserting that the paucity of prepublication material for Norris's novels makes a "definitive edition" impossible (pp. 70-71, 74) and stating that he cannot conceive of a "definitive edition" of any work: "Every edition with which I am familiar could be upset completely by the emergence of some document not available to the editor" (p. 67). But surely no scholar imagines that a piece of work can be produced that could not be overturned by the discovery of new documentary evidence. To claim that CEAA policy requires editors to undertake a task that everyone agrees is manifestly impossible is merely to set up a straw man. Katz does say that "the problem is in part a matter of rhetoric"; but when he adds, "so are most editorial problems," one wonders how to take other parts of his own essay. Like his comments on definitiveness, his discussion of "author's final intentions" is in fact a rhetorical exercise and does not get to the interesting aspects of the issue, but it appears to have been written under the impression that a matter of substance was being taken up. What bothers him about the phrase "author's final intentions," he says, is the assumption "that there is always and invariably a single work" (p. 67)—"that an author himself always and invariably pursues a work until it has reached its one ideal state—or that he wants to, or that he ought to want to" (pp. 74-75). It seems unlikely, however, that many people have ever held such an assumption. Certainly Greg himself and those who have in general followed his rationale have recognized that various "final intentions" might exist with respect to different versions of a work that deserve to be taken as independent entities. 19 By using his space on a non-issue, Katz has neglected to look into any of the intriguing questions that the concept of intention raises, such as how one decides when to treat a version of a work as if it were a separate work. Similarly, he begins with the often-repeated, but insubstantial, criticism that current editorial thinking assumes "the existence of a proven editorial routine which will produce definitive texts of works written at any time, in any place"; 20 and at the end he makes the point in an equally familiar way by saying that "the problems faced by scholars concerned mainly with editing dramatic texts of the English Renaissance are not the problems that confront the editor of a nineteenth-century American text." These assertions are again matters of rhetoric and skirt the significant issues. Obviously there are differences of detail among textual situations from different periods, but there are some underlying central questions of editing that remain constant and that must be thought about before one can responsibly proceed to those details. And to claim that "current theory" entails a rigid routine is not only to confuse theory and practice but also to miss the flexibility built into the basic CEAA statements and exhibited in the various CEAA editions. This is not necessarily to argue on behalf of the CEAA editions but only to point out that Katz's paper does not go past certain stock responses to consider the real issues that are involved. A paper that deals more seriously—but in the end no more success-fully—with problems raised by the concept of authorial intention is Hans Zeller's "A New Approach to the Critical Constitution of Literary Texts," which appeared in printed form in early 1975. 21 This paper serves as a convenient summary for English-speaking readers of a position that has been gaining acceptance in Germany. Zeller's argument essentially is that any authorial alteration of a work creates a new "version" of the work and that each version is a independent entity which should not be emended by an editor with authorial variants from another version. This position, which limits the critical role of the editor to the detection and correction of errors within each version, is said to rest on the view that any alteration of a work produces a different relationship among all the elements of the work and on the belief that an author's artistic intentions cannot be disentangled from various practical and worldly concerns. Both these points have much to be said for them, but they do not necessarily lead to the conclusion Zeller draws. One can argue that the editor is in a position to attempt to discriminate among kinds of revisions and among various motivations for revision and that not to attempt such discriminations is to ignore many of the nuances of the textual situation, the result being an oversimplified picture. Presumably no one would deny the value of editions of individual versions of a work, but a more eclectic approach also has its particular merits. Zeller's position deserves to be considered as part of the recurrent challenge to the soundness of the critical editing that has followed from Greg's rationale; 22 his arguments, however, do not finally call into serious question the usefulness of an approach that allows an editor, as an act of critical scholarship, to make judgments not simply about the correction of error but also about the emendation of readings revised by the author. 23 Later in 1975 Studies in the Novel devoted a special number, edited by Warner Barnes and James T. Cox, to "Textual Studies in the Novel" (vol. 7, no. 3). Among other contributions, 24 this collection includes an article by John Freehafer, "Greg's Theory of Copy-Text and the Textual Criticism in the CEAA Editions" (pp. 375-388), which the editors in their preface describe as singling out "for specific (and often harsh) criticism many of the practical and theoretical problems inherent in the CEAA editions" (p. 319). Freehafer does make a few valid criticisms and helpful suggestions—such as lamenting the customary omission in CEAA volumes of a historical record of variants in punctuation and spelling, and pointing out the desirability of making available facsimiles of significant documents in the textual history of particular works—but these observations occur in the midst of many others that misrepresent what Greg's rationale entails or repeat certain well-rehearsed but ill-informed objections to it. His expression of surprise that two editors following Greg but choosing different copy-texts of Dryden's The Indian Emperour should come up with texts that vary at a great many points (p. 377) indicates the level of his response to Greg's rationale. He takes the divergence as an indication that the editors have adhered too mechanically to their copy-texts instead of recognizing that an expectation of identical results presupposes a precision alien to any procedure relying on critical judgment. It is no criticism of Greg's rationale, of course, to say that it has been misused by some editors as a means for avoiding judgment. "The popularity of Greg's theory of copy-text as it has thus come to be applied," Freehafer claims, "may be partly because it often relieves the textual editor of the difficult task of trying to recognize authorial corrections, afterthoughts, or revisions, especially in accidentals" (p. 382). Freehafer does recognize Greg's emphasis on critical judgment, and the phrase "as it has thus come to be applied" makes this sentence tautological. Whether or not CEAA editors have in fact avoided making textual decisions is another matter, and one not related to Greg's rationale. The old question of the applicability of Greg's approach to nineteenth-century texts is one that Freehafer is inclined to answer in the negative, but his reasoning again refers to an inflexibility that is not part of Greg's own statement. The CEAA editor, he says, faced with series of authorially revised editions that are common in the nineteenth century, is likely to choose an early text "as a source of readings more often than he should" (p. 379); but Greg made allowance for selecting revised editions as copy-texts when circumstances warrant. Freehafer's piece requires little discussion and in any case has already been sufficiently analyzed in "The Center for Editions of American Authors: A Forum on Its Editions and Practices," which immediately follows his essay (pp. 389-406). 25 Two more essays of 1975 represent extremes, one being less important and the other more important than any of the discussions thus far examined. What is probably the most uninformed and irresponsible criticism of the CEAA, Peter Shaw's "The American Heritage and Its Guardians," appeared in late 1975 in the American Scholar . 26 Because of its publication in a general journal, Shaw's article has perhaps reached a wider audience than any of these others. No doubt some readers without any background in textual matters have been persuaded by it; but anyone acquainted with the CEAA editions and the recent series of editions of the papers of American statesmen knows how far off the mark Shaw is when he claims that the editions of the statesmen generally show more fidelity to the historical documents than do the "eclectic" editions of literary figures. Whether or not one approves of the CEAA editions or of Greg's rationale, one can see that Shaw misunderstands the "eclecticism" of modern critical editing and does not recognize why the unrecorded alterations that occur in many of the historical editions constitute a weakness. The article is full of confusions and repeats many of the clichés about the CEAA without adding significantly to the discussion. Shaw was simply unprepared to write such a piece, and it can safely be dismissed. 27 At the other extreme is an essay by Fredson Bowers, "Remarks on Eclectic Texts," 28 published at about the same time. This long discussion is an essay in definition: it explores, with many illustrations, what is meant by eclecticism in editing and shows the scholarly significance of critical editions. As a reaction against the unprincipled eclecticism of some editors in previous centuries, there has been a twentieth-century current of distrust of eclecticism. This distrust has taken many forms, as the essays of Zeller and Shaw suggest. Thus Bowers's discussion goes to the heart of one of the principal issues raised by critics of the CEAA editions. After examining in detail the application to various kinds of situations of an approach that aims to establish a text that will best represent its author's intentions, he arrives at an eloquent statement summarizing why the results of this approach "should constitute the finest flower of textual scholarship": "the main scholarly demand is for an established critical text embodying the author's full intentions (not merely one segment of them in an inevitably imperfect form) insofar as these can be ascertained by an expert who has had available all documentary sources and has devoted time and study to their transmissional history and authority" (p. 527). Bowers recognizes that facsimile editions have their uses and understands that in some cases two versions of a work are so different as to make any attempt to construct a single eclectic text inappropriate. But he shows that normally the expertise of the editor is not put to its highest use if it does not result in a single critical text: "Literary critics, historians, general scholars, students of all kinds—these need as authoritative a reconstruction of a full text as the documents allow, not editions of the separate documents, except when the distance is so great as to make eclectic reconstruction impossible" (p. 528). 29 Bowers's careful and thorough discussion will now be the standard reference to cite when questions are raised about the meaning or value of eclecticism in modern scholarly editing. 30 Another essay of Bowers's, the following year, deserves mention here both because it provides a convenient and thoughtful general summary of the approach to editing that derives from Greg and because it opens the way to the serious reconsideration of Greg that was to occur in the following years. Delivered in an abridged form before the Bibliographical Society of America in 1976, "Scholarship and Editing" 31 principally offers an authoritative statement regarding modernization, eclecticism, radiating texts, choice of copy-text (Greg's rationale), 32 and apparatus. But it also comments on "exceptions to Greg's rationale" in which "the author can be shown to have devoted as much attention [in a revision] to the formal features of his text as to its material or substantive features" (p. 179). Such texts "appear to call for a relaxation of Greg's principle," he says, "not at all for the reasons adduced for Ben Jonson [i.e., the thoroughness of the substantive revision in Every Man in His Humour ] but instead because the author can be shown to have paid such particular care to the essentials of his formal presentation" as to make a later edition "more authoritative in its accidentals on the whole" than the first. This kind of situation can be said to offer an exception to Greg's rationale in the sense that it requires the editor to depart from the common pattern of adopting as copy-text the text closest to the author's manuscript. Calling it an "exception," however, should not lead one to infer that it is not taken into account in Greg's essay. Greg cites Every Man in His Humour at one point (p. 390) as an example of substantive revision, but he also uses it as an illustration of an author's supervising "the printing of the new edition," correcting the proffs and taking responsibility for the revised edition "in respect of accidentals no less than substantive readings" (p. 389). 33 Bowers issues a useful caution, in other words, against interpreting Greg with an inflexibility alien to the spirit of his essay. Whereas Greg criticized "the tyranny of the copy-text" (p. 382) by arguing in favor of the use of editorial judgment to determine authorial revisions or corrections that should be incorporated into the copy-text, Bowers points out a different kind of tyranny: Greg's concept of divided authority, he says, "has been so welcome to recent textual critics that they have had a tendency to overreact against any other rationale" and thus "have been loath to accept any suggestion of a return to unified authority even when the special situation warrants it" (pp. 179-180). This statement succinctly summarizes a situation brought about by the success of Greg's essay; but one would be incorrect to attribute the situation to a weakness or oversight in Greg's position, since Greg covers the possibility that undivided authority can reside in a later edition and emphasizes flexibility in approaching the great variety of "cases of revision" (p. 390). 34 So long as one arrives at a sensible editorial rationale, it does not of course matter whether or not one finds support for it in Greg's essay. But so much has been written, pro and con, about the relation between Greg and the CEAA editions that it is worth noting just how much is actually encompassed within his rationale. Bowers's essay, by calling attention to a new kind of textual tyranny, provides an occasion for doing this at a critical point in the history of recent textual discussion, just before the appearance of two major analyses. These two major essays, which must be carefully considered by all who are concerned with modern editing, were published just about a year apart in 1977 and 1978, the first by Tom Davis and the second by Bowers himself. They raise more fundamental questions about the broad applicability of Greg's rationale and analyze them more cogently than all but one or two of the earlier CEAA-related discussions. Davis's piece, 35 a long review of the whole CEAA undertaking, is balanced and thoughtful: although Davis has some serious reservations, he is also able to praise the contributions to "literary, bibliographical, and historical scholarship" made by the CEAA editions (p. 63), and it is clear that, unlike some previous commentators, he is approaching the issues with an open mind. 36 If it is an overstatement to describe, as he does, the "intense textual debate" generated by the CEAA as "profoundly stimulating and valuable," those adjectives may be applied to his own contribution; and he is right to make the interesting point that the extent and prominence of the continuing discussion mark "the beginnings of a replication of the scholarly audience that the editor of classical texts can expect" (p. 61). Davis concludes with the familiar complaint that CEAA editors have been too rigid in applying what they take to be rules derived from Greg, and he advocates "greater use of editorial judgement" (p. 71). What distinguishes his essay from most of the others that arrive at similar conclusions is the quality of the analysis leading up to the conclusion. He concentrates on two CEAA "methods or rules" that are "adopted from Greg's paper" and "depend on logical inconsistencies": the distinction between substantives and accidentals and the idea of following the copy-text when variants are indifferent. Even though the careful reader is not likely to be in complete agreement with Davis, the intelligence of his analysis makes his argument a rewarding one to think through. On the distinction between substantives and accidentals, Davis's position is that the concept, both in Greg's essay and in restatements by CEAA editors, is so fuzzy as to be useless and that, in this form at least, it should be scrapped. As he explains it, the trouble essentially is that the definition of substantives as words and accidentals as punctuation and spelling does not coincide with the further definition of substantives as elements of meaning and accidentals as elements of form. CEAA editors do, of course, recognize accidentals as having a kind of meaning distinct from purely formal features of typographic design, for they are concerned to reproduce the former but not the latter. The "absurd consequence," in Davis's words, is that "all CEAA editors are committed simultaneously to the dedicated pursuit of authorial spelling and punctuation, while being equally committed to the belief that these phenomena are meaningless" (p. 68). Obviously Davis has, for effect, made this statement sound as absurd as possible; a fairer way to put the matter would be to say that serious scholarly editors (whether associated with the CEAA or not) regard spelling and punctuation as meaningful parts of a text 37 but that some of them have been careless in distinguishing nonverbal elements ("accidentals") of a text from the words themselves so as to suggest that the former do not convey meaning. Davis's treatment does dramatize the sloppiness of thinking that has often been associated, from Greg onward, with attempts to define "substantives" and "accidentals." A number of CEAA editors have from the beginning been dissatisfied with these terms and their implications, and several criticisms of Greg's terminology have appeared in print; indeed, much of what Davis says on this score is inherent in Morse Peckham's 1971 essay, 38 though Davis's expression of it is clearer and more forceful. In one sense all this attention is misplaced, for in practice editors have not thought in terms of "substantives" and "accidentals" when making emendations: any variant reading in a later text, whether in wording or spelling or punctuation, has been accepted into the copy-text if it can convincingly be attributed to the author. Of course, as Greg predicted, one can less often argue with conviction about revisions in spelling and punctuation than about revisions in wording, but the same process of thought has been applied to all variants. From another point of view, however, one cannot so easily dismiss the problem, for incoherence of argument deserves to be deplored whether or not it has practical consequences; the very fact that it may not have consequences is in itself troubling. Just because Greg stresses the casualness of his distinction between substantives and accidentals and calls it "practical" rather than "philosophic" is no reason to overlook the problems it causes. On the other hand, one can tell, with a little reflection, that what Greg proposes is not as illogical as the language he uses would seem to imply: it is clear that his distinction was not meant to describe the nature of written communication but only to indicate how people have in fact often reacted to spelling and punctuation. If people who can affect textual transmission, such as compositors or publishing-house editors, think of spelling and punctuation in general as elements of form, distinct from "content," or words, their treatment of those features and the kind of attention they devote to them may be affected. It does not matter whether they are right to make such a distinction; what matters to the scholarly editor, who is a historian, is whether people have indeed acted on this conception. Davis is quite right, therefore, to stress "the actual or inferred practice of authors and printers" (p. 68). Although he is not the first to make this point, his use of it is particularly effective. 39 Following a lucid account of textual and typographical meaning (and the way in which printers sometimes have control over "not only the signs in a text that are not considered to generate the meaning of the work, but also many that do" [p. 64]), he provides an excellent summary of Greg that emphasizes the behavior of authors and printers, beginning with this sentence: "Greg's central insight is that both writers and printers tend to make a distinction between the words, and the spelling, punctuation, italicization, paragraphing, hyphenation, and so forth, of the text" (p. 65). After this summary (the paragraph beginning at the bottom of p. 65 should stand as a classic statement of Greg's approach), he points out that his paraphrase unfortunately does not represent the way in which Greg or the CEAA editors present the rationale, and he proceeds to show the difficulties that ensue when the equation of words with meaning, and punctuation with form, is enunciated as if it had a "philosophic" truth beyond its "practical" value in describing the behavior of writers and printers. The fact that Davis can regard his fine summary as a "paraphrase" of Greg, despite the illogicalities that he subsequently specifies in Greg's discussion, shows that he is able to see through the surface confusions to the clear-sighted position that lies beneath. Similarly, I can assert that a number of CEAA editors, regardless of how they may have worded their summaries of Greg, understand his position in the same way that Davis does and would concur in Davis's paraphrase. That does not of course excuse lack of rigor in presentation, and I am not for a moment suggesting that Davis was wrong to criticize many of the restatements of Greg that appear in CEAA editions. But I would add that to concentrate on those statements is to stop short of investigating the way in which Greg's distinction has actually been employed in editing. That there may be a discrepancy between the rhetoric employed in some editions and the editorial approach to spelling and punctuation manifested in the editing itself is unfortunate, but to dwell on the former rather than to see through it to the latter is not finally to get to the heart of the matter. Davis's incisive treatment of the distinction between substantives and accidentals leads one to be somewhat disappointed that his analysis ends with criticism of the language used by CEAA editors; one would expect, from the level of his previous discussion, that he might have examined the extent to which the actual editorial practice of those editors is accurately reflected in their statements, just as he was able to "paraphrase" what Greg was getting at in the "Rationale" in spite of the language in which it was expressed. In any case, one can agree with Davis when he says, "It is to be hoped then that we shall not hear much more about accidentals and substantives, but about words, and punctuation, and the actual or inferred practice of authors and printers" (p. 68). A number of editors and writers on editing have for some time now been reluctant to use these terms or have in fact refrained from using them; and it is clear that the time has come when the terms should in most situations be abandoned. The real contribution that Greg makes can—as I shall suggest shortly—be taken advantage of without clouding the issues by the use of these questionably defined terms. 40 The second of Davis's two major points is a criticism of Greg's suggestion that the copy-text reading be retained whenever the editor finds the variant readings indifferent. Unfortunately Davis's treatment of this question is less satisfactory than his treatment of the previous one, for here he only alludes to the central issue involved; he does not pursue it at all but instead turns to a less significant aspect of the general question and then falls short of his own standard of perceptiveness (amply demonstrated earlier) in handling it. He begins on a promising note by questioning whether Greg's generalization is applicable to later periods; nineteenth-century novels, he points out, are "much more subject to authoritative revision than those works with which Greg was concerned" (p. 70). "It is by no means inevitable," he continues, "that in the case of indifferent verbal variants non-evident compositorial error will preponderate; it is possible that the reverse is true." And if "such errors do not preponderate, then to treat all indifferent variants as compositorial errors is to increase one's chances of adopting the wrong reading." Clearly the question raised here is of crucial importance. Whether or not Greg's rationale is valid for post-Renaissance writings has of course been frequently asked, often in trivial ways; but the real heart of the issue is to determine whether the circumstances of publishing in certain periods were such that textual variations in later editions were more likely to be authorial than compositorial. If such were the case, then Greg's rationale would obviously not be applicable to those periods, for it would lead editors in the wrong direction, assigning presumptive authority to an early text rather than a later one. 41 Instead of following this interesting line of thought, however, Davis lamely concludes: "in practice since there is no way of knowing which kind of reading preponderates [authorial revision or compositorial error], 42 no ascertainable harm is done by following Greg's principle, so long as its tentativeness is preserved." If it is true that one cannot generalize about the nature of the indifferent variants, then it is also true that no ascertainable harm would come from choosing an early, rather than a later, text as copy-text and assigning it presumptive authority in the case of indifferent variants; but neither would any ascertainable good come from it, and under those circumstances one would have no justifiable reason to follow Greg's approach. To believe that an otherwise unjustifiable approach would be permissible if its "tentativeness" were emphasized is not a very constructive position; one would do better to regard seriously Davis's earlier point that "taking the trouble to toss a coin would statistically speaking give one a better text." The fact is, however, that Greg's rationale, for all its tentativeness, is predicated on the belief that one can indeed generalize about the deterioration of successive texts in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century editions; otherwise there would be no justification for retaining the readings of an early edition at points where variants are indifferent. And if one is to employ Greg's approach in dealing with later writings, one cannot simply appeal to tentativeness but must confront the question whether the same generalization applies to other periods. This central question, brought up but not analyzed by Davis, is examined by Bowers in the essay to which we shall shortly turn. First, however, we should note what Davis concentrates on instead. Taking as his theme the "tentativeness" of Greg, he points out the way in which CEAA editors and commentators have in his opinion hardened Greg's tentativeness into "something much nearer certainty." He calls it a "heresy" (against Greg, that is) to claim that by retaining copy-text substantives (as well as accidentals, of course) in cases of indifferent variants one maximizes the chances of incorporating the author's intended readings. It is true that Greg considers the choice of copy-text to depend "solely on its formal features (accidentals)" and says that "fidelity as regards substantive readings is irrelevant" (p. 386); but these statements are not inconsistent with his view, regarding substantive variants in revised editions, that a later variant which is "either completely indifferent or manifestly inferior, or for the substitution of which no motive can be suggested, should be treated as fortuitous and refused admission to the text" (pp. 387-388). Whether or not Greg can be interpreted as supporting the position, however, is not the principal point, as Davis realizes. What Davis argues is that CEAA editors and commentators, who believe they are acting in the best interests of preserving the author's intention by emending the copy-text with later readings (both substantives and accidentals) only when there is compelling evidence to do so, are in fact guilty of yielding to "the tyranny of the copy-text." There is some irony in this situation, since everyone is agreed that Greg's aim was to give editors freedom to use their judgment in deciding individual readings and to liberate them from feeling bound to the substantives of the copy-text (or to all the substantive variants of a later text in which it is clear that some are authorial). The crux of the disagreement lies in determining what is meant by an "indifferent" variant. If an editor describes a particular variant as somewhat suggesting an authorial rather than a compositorial hand but finally considers the suggestion not to be strong enough to justify emendation of the copy-text, Davis believes that such an editor has not really regarded the variant as indifferent and has simply retreated to the comfort of sticking with the copy-text. Naturally, different editors might make different decisions on whether to emend at a given point: allowing editors to exercise judgment ensures that there will be no uniformity of result. But just because an argument can be made for emending need not lead one to think that the failure to emend signifies a backing away from a decision and a reliance on a mechanical rule. It is crucial in scholarly critical editing, after all, for editors to distinguish between their personal preferences and their informed judgment regarding what the author would have preferred. Calling a variant indifferent, therefore, is another way of saying that the evidence for its being authorial (or nonauthorial) is not, in the editor's judgment, sufficient to settle the matter. The trouble with Davis's discussion of this point is, first, that he does not make adequate allowance for the role of scholarly judgment in the determination of what is indifferent, and, second, that he does not investigate the question whether Greg's suggestion for the treatment of indifferent variants is valid for periods other than the Renaissance. 43 Davis ends with some examples from CEAA texts, intended to show the need for a fuller recognition of the "subjective and critical process" involved in critical editing, and he repeats the usual points (which are not in question) about the inevitable lack of definitiveness of the products of a critical process. 44 The last part of his essay is thus less impressive than the earlier part; but that early part takes its place as one of the key passages in the whole editorial discussion stimulated by the CEAA. If more of the discussion had been on such a level, editorial thinking would now be more advanced than it is. The other major essay of this period, and one of greater significance, is Fredson Bowers's "Greg's 'Rationale of Copy-Text' Revisited." 45 This remarkable essay confronts directly the question of the applicability of Greg's rationale to periods other than those Greg himself was familiar with and suggests that certain cautions are in order in attempting to make such a transference. Because Bowers is the most influential champion of Greg's rationale, his reservations on this score are particularly striking. Champions of causes are often regarded as being inflexibly committed to the positions with which their names are normally identified, and some superficial critics of the CEAA have looked at various CEAA editors, including Bowers, in this light. Anyone who has followed Bowers's writings carefully, however, will recognize that this essay is not the first occasion on which his concern with developing an editorial rationale for works of the last four centuries has led him to adapt or move beyond what Greg specifically says. Perhaps the most important earlier instance is his essay on "Multiple Authority," 46 which complements Greg's "Rationale" by taking up a class of textual relationships not covered by Greg (radiating texts, standing equidistant from a lost common ancestor, as opposed to a series of texts in linear descent). In contrast to that essay, which supplements Greg, the recent essay provides an incisive analysis of what Greg does in fact say. Bowers's knowledge of Renaissance texts enables him to examine closely the illustrations cited by Greg and to explain, more precisely than had been done before, the way in which Greg's recommendations arise from the textual situations generally encountered in work on Renaissance literature. From that firm base, he can then explore how well what Greg was saying fits other situations more characteristic of later periods. It is hard to imagine anyone better equipped for this task: Bowers's extensive editing of works from many periods has provided him with an amazing range of detailed examples. This kind of knowledge is exactly what had been missing from previous discussions of the broad applicability of Greg, and thoughtful editors will need to work their way through Bowers's analyses. As the essay makes clear, the significance of copy-text for Greg was rather different from what it has been for editors of nineteenth- and twentieth-century works. Greg was under no misapprehension that the accidentals of an Elizabethan printed book reflected much of the author's practice; for Greg the choice of an early edition to supply copy-text was simply an expedient measure designed to ensure that the edited text would have accidentals as close in time and place to the author's as possible. As one moves to works of later periods, however, with more fixed spelling and punctuation and for which more authorial manuscripts survive, the chances of choosing a copy-text that will preserve authorial accidentals increases. For the editors of later works, accidentals have "a literary interest, not merely a philological" one: these editors are likely to believe "that the accidentals are an inseparable whole with the substantives in transmitting the author's total meaning" (p. 125). Therefore for them the choice of copy-text "transcends the grounds of expediency and must be recognized as having a critical significance beyond that which Greg conceived"; and they will more often be able to exercise critical judgment in the choice of accidentals "on the same basis that Greg urges for the substantives" (pp. 128-129). Although this difference in point of view might affect the significance of particular choices of copy-text, I think one can say that it would not in itself require different general rationales of copy-text for different periods. One could operate, for instance, within Greg's general rationale, even though the different conditions associated with different periods might cause editors more often to find persuasive evidence for selecting a revised edition in certain periods than in others. What would remain the same would be the presumption in favor of an early text as copy-text over a later, except when there is convincing evidence to the contrary. But since the purpose of choosing a copy-text is solely to provide a rationale for handling indifferent variants (substantives as well as accidentals), this presumption is fruitful only if there is reason to believe that texts normally deteriorate as they are reprinted or copied. We come back, then, to this issue as the central one. Bowers's analysis of the differences between Greg's concerns in his own editing and the concerns of editors of later writings is enlightening; but the question whether Greg's rationale is applicable to all periods (or periods other than the one for which it was originally designed) is a separate question, and one that turns entirely on the validity of the idea that texts usually deteriorate as they are transmitted. Bowers's attention to this point is therefore the aspect of his paper that is of the greatest moment. There is no need here to go over the illustrations he discusses from post-Renaissance literature; they are all cogently set forth, and I have no quarrel with the textual observations made in them. What I wish to comment on is the generalization drawn from these examples. Bowers concludes that, in cases of linear transmission from manuscript to print or from one printed edition to another, the closer one comes to periods where compositorial accuracy improves— especially in the setting from printed copy—the more the authority grows in favor of variants in a revised edition and the more likely it is that an indifferent variant in the revised text is authorial, not compositorial. If so, a very real question arises whether Greg's advice is a good editorial principle to adopt under changed conditions from those of Renaissance compositorial and scribal free-wheeling. (p. 155) Although this statement specifically deals with substantive variants, a similar point is made about accidentals: it is at least allowable that from the late seventeenth century when more uniformity in spelling and in standards of punctuation began to be imposed on compositors, the uncertainty that attaches to Elizabethan conditions of transmission begins to clear. . . . With the change come certain modifications that may need to be applied to the popular interpretation of Gregs' rationale. (p. 129) 47 The concept of "accuracy" or fidelity entailed here clearly involves more than compositors' skill in following copy; it also takes into account their conventional practices. The state of English spelling in the Renaissance was such that compositors could feel free to follow their own spelling habits or to alter spellings to facilitate justification. As a result, what they set was not "accurate" in the sense that it did not fully correspond to their copy; but the lack of correspondence was not—at least in many cases was not—owing to carelessness or lack of ability. In the same way, any attempt to assess the performance of compositors in later periods must take into consideration the practices that compositors were expected, or allowed, to engage in. As spelling became more fixed, compositorial freedom to introduce variant spellings was correspondingly reduced; but if another kind of compositorial interference took its place, the divergence between copy and print was not necessarily decreased. For example, the growing concern with "correctness" of spelling and with syntactical punctuation in the nineteenth century meant that compositors were often expected to impose the preferred forms on wayward copy; such compositors did not have the freedom of their Elizabethan counterparts to follow their own inclinations, but they might equally transform the copy they were working from. 48 Furthermore, the differences between manuscript and first edition or between one edition and the next are not entirely to be accounted for by the activity of compositors, for there may also be copyeditors or publishers' "readers" whose function it is to make certain kinds of alterations (including many that are substantive) before the compositors enter the picture. Such persons were less in evidence in earlier years, before publishing as a distinct operation had fully developed; but in later years (the last two centuries or so), during the very time when—one might argue—compositorial fidelity to copy generally increased, the structure of publishing grew in complexity, and new positions with responsibility for making alterations in printer's copy came into being. The question that must be asked, therefore, is not whether compositorial accuracy increased over the years but whether the printing-publishing process as a whole has in certain periods resulted in so little alteration of printer's copy that, in the absence of contrary evidence, one had better regard the later variants, both substantives and accidentals, as presumably authorial. It is extremely difficult, of course, to generalize about such matters. Not all printers and publishers in a given period will have behaved the same way—nor will a single publisher necessarily have treated each author the same way. Editors must naturally search for any evidence bearing on these matters in individual cases; and the more they learn about the author and the printers and publishers involved, the less they are in need of a generalization to fall back on. But when they can find no direct evidence pertaining to a particular situation, they are forced to try to generalize about the practices prevalent in the period in parallel circumstances. The papers of other authors and publishers are one source, and another is the published comments that appear in printers' manuals, publishers' style books, authors' guides, and the like. There have recently been some surveys of these books, showing—despite many individual variations—that it was not uncommon, through the nineteenth century and into the twentieth, for printers and publishers to regard spelling and punctuation as their preserve. 49 My own unsystematic examination of such books confirms this view. Not long ago, for instance, I came across Benjamin Drew's Pens and Types; or, Hints and Helps for Those Who Write, Print, or Read , published by Lee &amp; Shepard of Boston in 1872—a book that I have not seen referred to in the published surveys. Its statements may of course reflect only the policy of Lee &amp; Shepard, but on the subject of punctuation they do coincide with those of a number of other books. The distinction it makes between words and punctuation in fact resembles Greg's generalization about the practices of printers nearly three centuries earlier. Drew, after calling punctuation "the perfection of common sense," continues: The printer and proof-reader are to take for granted, that, in every work which falls under their supervision, the proper agreement between thought and expression has been effected by the author. He alone has the right to change the words and their collocation; and, if fairly punctuated, it is better that the manuscript be, in this respect also, closely followed. Every person who writes for the press should punctuate his work presentably; but—since the majority of writers are inattentive to punctuation— custom and convenience, if not necessity, have thrown upon the compositor and proof-reader the task of inserting in their proper places the grammatical points, that the author's meaning may be more readily apprehended. (p. 51) Drew's attitude toward punctuation is clearly a nineteenth-century one, but his assertion that authors pay more attention to words than to punctuation and his acceptance of compositorial alteration of punctuation as a routine occurrence are not very different from points made by Greg. Even the idea that the division between words and punctuation is expedient, not logical, emerges from this passage—since the admission is made that punctuation can affect meaning. 50 Above all, Drew makes clear that the printer has authority over the punctuation: the author's punctuation is to be followed only if the manuscript is "fairly" or "presentably" punctuated. One cannot generalize from the passage, or the many others like it, and claim that the attitudes expressed there were universal. Nevertheless, evidence of this sort turns up frequently enough to make one feel hesitant about accepting a generalization for any period that would place presumptive authority in the case of indifferent accidentals with the later rather than the earlier readings. And the same can obviously be said with equal force for substantive variants, especially in the years after the publishing industry became well developed: the officiousness of nineteenth-century publishers' "readers" is notorious. What must be emphasized is that in thinking about copy-text one is concerned only with indifferent variants. Whenever one has good reasons for choosing particular readings, one has no need for a copy-text theory; and among the reasons that will prevent readings from seeming indifferent is knowledge one has about the practices of the printer and publisher involved. The question for copy-text theory is whether, in the absence of evidence that one finds persuasive bearing on a particular case, one can generalize about a period as a whole and say that the odds favor the authority of indifferent variants in a revised edition. The picture that continues to emerge regarding the processes of textual transmission in all periods suggests that it would be unwise to take such a position. Bowers's discussion confronts this central issue more directly than any other essay and ends up questioning the appropriateness of Greg's rationale for post-Renaissance literature. I do not disagree with his analyses of specific cases but would simply suggest a different emphasis: choosing readings from revised editions or selecting revised editions as copy-texts when the evidence points in that direction does not—even if such instances are frequent— negate the existence of publishers' editors who made revisions or of compositors who were trained in the tradition of certain printers' manuals and took punctuation as their domain. As long as such possibilities for nonauthorial alteration of texts exist—as they seem to in all periods—the conservative approach would appear to be to consider an early text the better choice when the editor does not judge the available evidence conclusive one way or the other. In addition to Bowers's essay, 1978 saw the appearance of several essays and a book that ought to be mentioned here. 51 One of the essays, by David Foxon, 52 is principally concerned with the same point as Bowers's. Arguing from his knowledge of the texts of Pope, Foxon suggests that Greg did not sufficiently distinguish between scribes and compositors: the latter were subject, Foxon says, to "the check of proof-reading, often by the author himself" (p. 121), as well as to the general rule set forth by Moxon that compositors were to follow copy strictly. An author's passing of proofs does not of course in itself tell one anything about that author's care in proofreading or imply that the text fully conforms to the author's intention. As for the printer's rule of compositorial fidelity, there were various occasions—as we have just noted and as Foxon himself observes— for departing from that rule, even though it is no doubt true that the simpler and easier course was to make no changes. Thus to say that Pope's compositors "followed copy rather than their own habits and inclinations, and this is what we expect from modern compositors" (p. 121) is not to say that as a general rule one should rely on compositorial fidelity. Foxon is right to notice that "correctors" at the press were also responsible for alterations 53 and to emphasize that the "crucial question" is what the author's practice was in correcting proof. He rightly sees where this leads (though I am not sure why it is a "frightening prospect," since it is to be taken for granted as the scholarly approach): editing a work "may well mean studying the whole publishing career of that author, the changes in his practices when writing manuscripts and when proofreading, the conventions of his printers" (p. 123). These are useful points for Foxon to have underscored; but it is not clear how his discussion is a modification of Greg. He has established that in reading proof Pope was as concerned with accidentals as with substantives; and in later editions Pope "continued to make revisions on a large scale," with the changes in accidentals outnumbering those in substantives—"later editions refine his punctuation and remove typographical inconsistencies" (p. 119). "In this context," Foxon asserts, "Greg's proposals are not applicable, and my experience suggests that the case of Pope is by no means unusual. The cause of our present difficulties is the belief that a single generalized rule can have universal application." All one can do in the face of such a statement, made at this late date by a perceptive and learned bibliographer, is to repeat once again—by now perhaps rather tiredly— what has been said time after time before: the only "generalized rule" that Greg proposes is for situations in which one has no basis otherwise for making a decision; to find that a number of authors revised accidentals as well as substantives so thoroughly for a late edition as to make that edition the best choice for copy-text in no way contradicts what Greg was saying. 54 At roughly the same time the first of a series of articles under the rubric "Redefining the Definitive" was published in the Bulletin of Research in the Humanities . The inauguration of a series to examine "definitive" editions in the first number of this journal under its new title shows its intention to continue the interest in editorial methodology exhibited in 1971, when it (as Bulletin of the New York Public Library ) contained a brief flurry of discussion about CEAA practices. 55 Although this first piece is devoted to particular textual decisions in one edition, 56 the second, later in the year, raises a general point about the treatment of punctuation in CEAA editions. In it Harry Knowles Girling argues that "CEAA-approved editors" restrict authorial freedom of punctuation by imposing printers' conventional practices on manuscripts or by preserving the compositorial practices of printed texts. 57 Authors who protest printers' regularizations of punctuation, he says, "would lament the embalming of printers' choices in a 'definitive' text of their work" (p. 303); and scholars who adhere to a printed copy-text are "expending their devoted labours in perpetuating the original flouting of authorial intentions" (p. 297). Girling's generalization here is off the mark: although some CEAA editors have in certain instances made unwise decisions about punctuation, CEAA editors for the most part would agree with Girling's insistence on the importance of authorial punctuation; the effort to incorporate authors' rather than printers' punctuation into scholarly texts has normally been one of their primary concerns. Despite this misplaced attempt to discredit CEAA editing, Girling's article is refreshing because his criticism is just the opposite of the more usual one: more often critics of the CEAA are inclined to say that authors expected their works to be styled by the printer or publisher and that selecting manuscripts as copy-texts does not do justice to the authors' intentions. Girling, however, believes—in line with most CEAA editors—that authorial punctuation reflects "semantic and stylistic distinctions" (p. 297) and that "the punctuation to be observed in nineteenth-century authors' manuscripts seems to have its own alternative consistency" (p. 303; alternative, that is, to printers' practice). He carries this position so far as to argue that "the editing of a piece of holograph manuscript as copy-text raises the question of the necessity of emending at all" (p. 304). Obviously a facsimile edition of a manuscript has its place; but if one is preparing a critical edition, one cannot by definition rule out the possibility of emending. An author's manuscript may contain slips of the pen or readings later altered by the author, and a critical editor using the manuscript as copy-text would have to emend at those points. Emendations involve judgment and therefore are sometimes wrong; but the goal is to establish, as Girling would wish, the readings (including punctuation) of the author. 58 The value of Girling's essay is that it provides a forceful statement of the reasons for preserving an author's own punctuation and offers one of the most detailed analyses available within the context of editorial discussion showing the ways in which punctuation affects meaning. After examining the changes in punctuation in the New York Edition of The Princess Casamassima , he concludes that James "had succeeded in exemplifying a punctuation system unguided by rules or precedents, and controlled only by a sense of taste and style" (p. 318). James's approach, he goes on, "gives a clue to the way that all authors (and all pen-wielders, even the most humble) might regard punctuation, were they not bullied into accepting a system that was developed to suit the exigencies of hand-compositors and maintained to support the conformist pieties of copy-editors and editorial scholars." One can overlook Girling's inaccurate generalizations about scholarly editors in order to have his strong argument on behalf of the determination and retention of authorial punctuation, an argument that in fact supports the view of a large proportion of editorial scholars. One more publication of 1978, appearing in September, is Philip Gaskell's From Writer to Reader: Studies in Editorial Method . This book consists of a ten-page introduction on the general principles of editing, followed by twelve chapters, each of which examines the textual problems in a particular work, normally focusing on a single passage and reproducing the various relevant texts of that passage. In his introduction Gaskell improves in some respects on his unsatisfactory treatment of editing at the end of A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972). 59 For instance, he now recognizes the reasons why it may be defensible to allow copy-text inconsistences to stand, and he sees that there is a difference between authorial acquiescence and intention. As a whole, however, his introductory chapter unfortunately does not succeed in providing a solid foundation for editorial thinking. His eagerness to emphasize the idea that one cannot edit by rules causes him to neglect certain basic principles or distinctions that are necessary for clear thinking on editorial matters. In a single sentence he can bring together three distinct approaches to editing without explaining how radically different they are: the editor, he says, in selecting a copy-text, "may consider whether the choice of a particular version will result in a system of punctuation, spelling, etc., in the edited text which is more likely than another to represent the author's own intentions for the form of the work; whether the resulting system is better critically than one that would result from a different choice; and whether it is the system most likely to be acceptable to readers of the edition" (p. 6). He proceeds to suggest that when an editor has insufficient evidence regarding authorial intentions, "the editor might decide for instance to follow the version that is best on critical grounds." What he never explains is how such a switch would mean preparing an entirely different kind of edition; he never clearly distinguishes between scholarly critical editing—in which the editors' judgments are directed toward attempting to establish what the author would have wanted—and another kind of editing in which choices are based on the editors' own critical preferences. Such imprecision and lack of logic occur throughout the book. 60 The individual analyses are nevertheless useful up to a point, since they conveniently bring together some basic information about a wide range of texts; but any commentary Gaskell adds to the factual information must be taken with great caution. Given Gaskell's declared "message" that "the editor should not base his work on any predetermined rule or theory" (p. vii), it is perhaps not surprising that he should have joined those who look on the CEAA as rigidly doctrinaire, inflexibly insistent on a single rule. A number of his observations appear to stem from this image of the CEAA, but the one chapter that directly involves a CEAA edition is the chapter on Hawthorne's The Marble Faun (pp. 183-195). That chapter is particularly relevant in the present context and can represent the kinds of problems that occur elsewhere in the book. 61 After a brief account of the surviving textual evidence, pointing out that the compositors of the first edition "normalized the text freely" (p. 185), Gaskell discusses the choice of copy-text. The Ohio State Marble Faun , he says, "is based, in accordance with the principles of the series, on the manuscript, not on the first printed edition" (p. 189). The manuscript is indeed the copy-text, but otherwise this sentence is misleading, for it suggests that the CEAA required surviving manuscripts to be used as copy-texts. What the CEAA guidelines in fact say is that a finished or printer's-copy manuscript would "normally" become copy-text but that an author's habits of revision in proof "may modify this choice." 62 Gaskell, however, is convinced of the rigidity of the CEAA and describes the CEAA application of Greg's rationale as "both more comprehensive and less flexible than Greg's pragmatic approach," asserting incorrectly that "it denies the editor much critical discretion in the choice of copy-text" (p. 190). 63 In extending Greg's rationale from Renaissance works, for which manuscripts do not often survive, to later works, the CEAA has —according to Gaskell— adopted the "very dubious" assumption that, "in the absence of evidence to the contrary, a nineteenth- or twentieth-century author 'intended' the manuscript rather than the printed version of his work" (p. 191). Gaskell does not pursue the meaning of authorial intention or explore reasons why students of an author might legitimately prefer to read a text with that author's punctuation rather than a compositor's or copy-editor's. Instead he shifts the grounds of the discussion: because, he says, we often cannot know whether authors "specifically approve or disapprove the normalization of the text" that occurs in the process of printing and publishing, all we can state is "that this version is to be preferred to that on other—perhaps critical—grounds." Just what he means by "critical" becomes clear in the next paragraph, when he explains why he agrees in this instance that the manuscript should be copy-text. The manuscript, he says, has "excellent punctuation" that contributes to the rhythm of Hawthorne's prose "in a way that the mechanical details of the normalized printed texts do not"; thus "there is a good critical case for basing an edition on the text of the final manuscript, which is that it offers the most convincing punctuation of the text" (pp. 191-192). The implication is that if the printed text had contained more "convincing" punctuation, it would become the copy-text, regardless of whether it was the author's. What Gaskell has done here—as he does repeatedly—is to confuse the attempt to establish an author's own words and punctuation with the attempt to produce the artistically "best" text of a work. He claims, "There is no need to introduce the assumption, which cannot be supported by evidence, that Hawthorne intended or would have preferred his own punctuation to that of the first edition" (p. 192). But if one is engaged in producing a scholarly critical edition, one is by definition attempting to establish an author's own words and punctuation, not one's own preferences, and part of the "evidence" is one's developed sensitivity to the author's characteristics. Whether the punctuation is "excellent" and "convincing" is beside the point, unless it is excellent and convincing in a way that the editor has learned, through close study of the author, to associate with that author's punctuation. The central issue Gaskell attempts to deal with here—the choice of copy-text as between manuscript and first edition, and the assessment of authorial intention in relation to this choice—deserves careful attention, but Gaskell's treatment only confuses the question. 64 He then turns to an evaluation of whether the emendations in the CEAA Marble Faun are "both necessary and right." In objecting to what he regards as excessive regularization, he makes some good points. But he nowhere alludes to the practice of other CEAA editions; and since at the beginning of the chapter he calls this volume "a typical CEAA edition" (p. 184), he leaves the impression that the kind of regularization he describes is characteristic of CEAA editions—which is not the case. Indeed, the final two paragraphs of the chapter consist of entirely unwarranted generalizations, coming at the conclusion of a discussion of a single volume: The CEAA and its editors have been noble in vision, rich in good intentions as well as in funds, indefatigable in industry, and scrupulous in accuracy. These qualities, and the features of the CEAA editions that derive from them, are applauded even by the CEAA's critics. Yet the whole great enterprise seems to have gone astray. CEAA editions are not and never can be "definitive"; their main editorial principle is unsound yet inflexibly applied; and individual editions sealed by the Center can be grossly imperfect. It would seem that editing—which is at least as much a part of literary criticism as of bibliography—cannot well be regimented, and that editors should always consider the why and the wherefore and the how of their work according to the circumstances and the needs of each individual case. Books of rules can prove delusive guides. (p. 195) The idea that one volume—regarded for whatever reason as "typical"—can lead to such conclusions derives from Gaskell's view of the inflexibility of the CEAA and the resulting assumption that all volumes in the series are identical. Actually, the "main editorial principle"—if by that is meant Greg's rationale—liberates editors to use their judgment; so even if it were "inflexibly applied" it would result in a great deal of variation, which in fact is what exists. I would certainly not wish to defend all CEAA volumes or every decision made in them. But whatever opinion one holds of individual volumes, one must deplore the kind of glib generalization that Gaskell indulges in here. It is sad to have to recognize that his book, which one might reasonably have expected to be an important statement, marks no advance in editorial thinking and indeed does not rise above the level of many of the less satisfactory contributions to this continuing discussion. 65 It remains to note briefly one or two comments from 1979, which unhappily show what little effect all this editorial debate has had on improving the caliber of some of the discussions that get into print. F. W. Bateson prefaces a textual discussion of The School for Scandal 66 with some remarks on Greg's rationale that exhibit the same mixing up of distinct approaches to editing already observed in Gaskell. Greg's "mechanical ruling," he says, growing out of work on Elizabethan drama, was more concerned with printers' corruptions than authors' revisions (p. 323), and he believes that "biblio-textual" research is "helpless before authorial revision " (p. 322)—an argument that obviously ignores the central role Greg gives to editorial judgment in detecting authorially revised readings. The novel aspect of his criticism of Greg, however, is his opinion that "Such textual philistinism as Greg's may be ultimately social in its origin" (p. 324); his astonishing view is that Greg, because he was wealthy and therefore interested in property, looked on literary works as the "private property" of their authors and wished to tie later editions and readers to authors' revised readings even when those readings were inferior. Everyone would agree that authors can be whimsical and unsystematic in making revisions: "A revision . . . may stay or go or revert to its original form as the author decides—on the inexplicable spur of the moment, or in the light perhaps of the passage's immediate context, or reconsidered to conform to the general pattern of the work or his writings generally (or even his life)" (p. 323). Of course an editor could continue this process, but the result would not be of particular interest to students of the author; the scholarly editor must be concerned with what the author did. Bateson does not seem to realize that scholarly critical editors are not limited to believing that last is best; they must, and do, try to assess the motivation underlying revisions and decide when revisions produce essentially new works, and they will not always adopt the last revision. But they could not agree with Bateson that the "responsible editor" will select "whatever after due consideration he (the editor) believes the best authorial version to be, whether it happens to be early, middle-period, or last" (p. 324). Editors of most authors will sympathize with Bateson when he says that Sheridan "was continually questioning himself—and very often coming up with the wrong answer!" (p. 333). But for a scholarly editor to choose, in each case of authorial revision, the reading that seems preferable "considered as meaning, good English, good literature" (p. 335) is not the way to be "responsibly eclectic" (p. 324). The place to make those judgments is not within the text of a scholarly critical edition. 67 Another comment from 1979 that reflects an unfortunate misconception—one that is perhaps more widespread—occurs in J. F. Fuggles's essay reviewing the bibliographical research of 1978. 68 In the course of this review he says that the argument for the exact transcription of historical documents would be strengthened by examples showing how "the meaning or significance had been affected by modernization" (p. 10). 69 Presumably he means "normalization" as well as "modernization," for the issue is broader than the question of whether or not to modernize. But the principal, and troubling, point is his implication that tampering with the punctuation and spelling of the original is unacceptable only if it can be shown to alter the meaning of the text. The burden of proof, however, should be the other way round. If an alteration is thought not to change the meaning (or "clarify" it, as some editors prefer to say), then what is the purpose of making it? Readers are not normally prevented from understanding a text by oddities and inconsistencies of punctuation and spelling, and when these irregularities are characteristic of the author what is the point of altering them? It is hard to see why editors think they are accomplishing anything by straightening out the details of spelling and punctuation in a letter or journal simply for the sake of tidying up. 70 To say that the tidying up does not alter the meaning is no defense, since it provides no reason for making any change at all. In fact, of course, any shift from the author's spelling and punctuation is likely to affect nuances of meaning. But even if that were not the case, why should one not prefer to read a document as its author wrote it? Fuggles proceeds to repeat an argument that should have been discredited long before now, one that attempts to make a distinction between historical documents and works of literature: "scholars come to different kinds of texts for different reasons," he says, and "inevitably this will influence editorial procedures. The historian will come to the letters of Lord John Russell because he is interested, perhaps, in what Lord John said to a cabinet colleague on a particular subject. Milton's punctuation will excite interest in a way that Lord John's will not" (pp. 10-11). It is no doubt true that Milton's punctuation is of greater interest than Russell's, but not for the reason Fuggles implies. Fuggles seems to be saying that historians are interested in "content" and that students of literature are concerned with "form" as well. But both groups wish to understand as fully as possible what is being communicated by certain pieces of writing. In approaching that task one can no more rule out Russell's punctuation than Milton's; the punctuation in each case is part of the essential evidence that scholars must have before them. The notion that punctuation is of more significance in "literature" than in other writing cannot be supported, even if what constitutes "literature" could be identified. That it still has its adherents shows that there is yet some way to go before fruitful communication among editors in all fields can be achieved. This glance over editorial discussions of the past six years has revealed, I trust, certain recurrent issues that have proved particularly troubling to those who have been moved to write about editorial matters. Some of the discussions have been irresponsible and others carefully thought out, but whatever their quality they keep returning to a small number of basic problems. Evaluating those discussions amounts to working out a coherent theoretical approach to editing, as I hope my remarks illustrate. But analyzing particular arguments as they come up in a chronological survey does not produce a systematic statement, though it can provide the underlying argument to support such a statement. As a result of working through these discussions, therefore, one should be in a position to formulate, and to read with understanding, a summary statement of editorial rationale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The central questions of editing can be simply put. Answers to them require thought and do not always come easily. But the editorial debate that has appeared in print in recent years has sometimes made the search for answers more complicated than necessary by diverting attention to issues that exist only as a result of misconceptions. Although there has thus been a certain amount of wasted effort, one at least can now be fairly sure of the problem spots. I shall therefore take advantage of the existence of all this discussion, and analysis of the discussion, by offering a compressed statement regarding the basic areas of difficulty. I need not elaborate on the points here, because the arguments have been rehearsed in detail, and often more than once, in what has appeared during the last several years. A concise expression of some basic propositions can serve a purpose, indeed, because of the very voluminousness of the published discussion. And I think that a further purpose can be served, at this stage, by making no reference to the CEAA or to Greg's rationale. Such a body of emotional reactions and stock responses has by now grown up around them that simply to mention them in a theoretical discussion deflects some readers' concentration in unprofitable directions. 71 Whether or not some ideas have been attributed to Greg that are not actually to be found in his writing is obviously a different question from whether or not those ideas are sound; but sometimes the two questions have become confused. There can be no doubt that Greg's rationale has been of crucial importance in the development of modern editorial thinking; but that thinking has carried Greg's line of reasoning beyond the point at which he left it. To keep returning to the question of whether Greg's rationale is applicable to periods later than the Renaissance, as some critics do, is a rather pointless way of proceeding, or at least places the emphasis on the wrong part of the issue. The important question is whether a particular way of thinking (which happens to have been influenced by Greg, but that is beside the point) offers a reasonable approach to editorial matters. The published debate suggests, I think, that the principal problems fall into three groups, and I shall describe what appears to me to be a reasonable approach to each of these three areas. The first set of questions consists of the preliminary ones that any editor must decide at the outset, questions about what kind of edition is to be undertaken. The most basic distinction is between editions in which the aim is historical—the reproduction of a particular text from the past or the reconstruction of what the author intended—and those in which the editor's own personal preferences determine the alterations to be made in a copy-text. Scholarly editions conform to the first approach, and presumably scholarly editing is what this whole debate has been about. Yet elementary as this distinction is, it has been lost sight of in some of the discussions. Historical scholarship naturally involves judgment and subjective decisions. But there is a difference between using one's informed judgment to attempt to decide what readings reflect the author's intention and making subjective decisions reflecting only one's own tastes and inclinations; and this difference has sometimes been ignored by those who are eager to stress the subjective element in critical editing. After one has decided to undertake a scholarly edition, and understands what that means, one still has to decide whether the edition is to be critical (that is, using editorial judgment to determine when, and whether, emendations are to be made in the text) or noncritical (that is, reproducing exactly one particular text, without alteration). Choice between these alternatives will be affected by the nature of the text to be edited: pieces of writing to be presented as documents are most appropriately provided in noncritical texts, whereas those to be presented as finished works are most usefully offered in critical texts. This is really all that needs to be said in a general way about the choice among different kinds of editions—the absence of any reference to modernizing, to the nature of the intended audience, or to whether or not writings are "literary" being meant to suggest that these matters need not be taken into account. However, so much has been said about them— they have proved to be the most prominent red herrings of editorial debate—that it now seems impossible to pass over them with no comment at all. Regularizing and modernizing (their aims may be different, but they amount to the same thing) are ahistorical in orientation and therefore have no place in the historical approach to texts—which is to say, in scholarly editions. Punctuation and spelling have been the subject of a disproportionately large amount of editorial discussion, principally as a result of a doubly-mistaken assumption: that punctuation and spelling are somehow not full-fledged elements of a text, giving an editor license to be freer with them than with the words, and that most readers will have difficulty reading—or may refuse to read—texts that do not exhibit in punctuation and spelling the consistency or the particular practices they are accustomed to. The defensible position in each case is the opposite: that punctuation and spelling are integral parts of a text, affecting its meaning and impact, 72 and that readers do not generally find it a great difficulty or inconvenience to read a text containing spelling and punctuation from an earlier time. If readers are not so easily put off as some editors think, and if there is at least a chance (to understate the case) that alterations in spelling and punctuation may distort the meaning, then why should editors go to the trouble of regularizing and modernizing? And if one follows this line of thinking, the question of intended audience becomes irrelevant, because a text prepared for scholars will also be the appropriate one to present to students and to the general public. The intended audience may indeed be a factor—for economic reasons—in deciding whether a detailed apparatus is to be published with the text; but there is no reason why it should be a factor in determining the treatment of the text itself. 73 Neither should the question whether the work is belletristic have a bearing: it is delusory to think that punctuation is more crucial to written "literature" than to the written communication of historians, philosophers, or scientists. That the line between "creative" writing and "factual" writing cannot be clearly defined is well illustrated by Hayden White's comments on what historical narratives "most manifestly are"—"verbal fictions, the contents of which are as much invented as found and the forms of which have more in common with their counterparts in literature than they have with those in the sciences." 74 Even scientific writing, though it may be different in some respects, uses words and punctuation to communicate ideas, and anyone wishing to understand a scientific work will need—just as much as readers of "literary" works—a text that is reliable in its punctuation as well as in its words. The second large group of questions concerns the nature of authorial intention and how one is to handle the difficult distinction between intention and expectation. First it should be said that these are questions entailing critical judgment and are relevant only to critical editing. If one is producing a noncritical text, one is concerned to reproduce what actually appears in a particular document or impression, regardless of the extent to which it reflects the author's intentions. Of course, critical judgment about intention may enter into the choice of document or impression to reproduce in the first place and into the annotation supplied with the noncritical text, but it will not have a bearing on the readings of the text itself. In a scholarly critical edition, on the other hand, the aim is to emend the selected text so that it conforms to the author's intention; one can never fully attain such a goal (or know that one has attained it), but at least one can move toward it by applying informed judgment to the available evidence. Obviously many writers have different intentions at different times, and in such cases one must decide which version of a work one wishes to edit, for no one critical text can reflect these multiple intentions simultaneously. But when an authorial revision does not indicate a new conception of a work but simply a continuation of the process of perfecting the expression of the same conception, that revision can legitimately replace the earlier reading in a single critical (that is, eclectic) text. Judging when such eclecticism is justified and when it is not remains a difficult decision, but it is central to critical editing. 75 A related and equally basic problem is determining what relation authorial expectation bears to intention. Sometimes one hears the argument that a first-edition text should be preferred to the manuscript printer's copy because the author expected certain alterations to be carried out in the publisher's office. Each case must of course be looked at individually, but two general considerations should be kept in mind: first, that readers of a scholarly critical text are primarily interested in what the author did rather than what a publisher's editor did; and, second, that authors give their "approval," in various ways and for various motives, to alterations that they do not really prefer (as anyone who has written for publication knows all to well). Whether one is speaking of changes in wording or changes in punctuation, it is too simple a view to claim that a particular author expected certain kinds of alterations to be made and therefore that the published text takes precedence over the manuscript text; in a specific instance the published text may indeed deserve to take precedence, but one must be extremely cautious about attributing authorial intention or preference to alterations simply because they were passed, in one fashion or another, by the author. Thus scholarly critical editors frequently find themselves trying to reverse the activities of earlier publishers' editors. In this connection, some comments recently made by Robert Gottlieb, president of Alfred A. Knopf, are particularly striking because they emphasize respect for the author's text and define the role of the publisher's editor as essentially one of encouragement and support. "Even now," Gottlieb says, "it irritates me to know that Dickens changed the end of 'Great Expectations' because someone told him to. It's bad enough that the change was a mistake, but it's even worse to know that someone convinced him to make it." 76 What the scholarly critical editor must do, as Gottlieb does here, is to consider the motivation underlying textual changes; such an editor must try to disentangle the author's own wishes from the other elements that shaped the published text. Authorial intention cannot be equated with expectation or with acquiescence, nor can one accept an author's statement of intention at face value. A critical edition, if it is to be worthy of its name, must examine such matters critically. The third of these large central questions is the problem of the socalled "indifferent" variant: that is, how is the editor to choose among variants in those cases in which critical analysis of the evidence finds the variants equally balanced and provides no basis for a critical choice of one over another? This problem has been much discussed under the guise of examining how to select a copy-text. It is not necessary to have a copytext at all, of course, unless there are in fact some indifferent variants. If at every point of variation in wording, punctuation, and spelling one is able to make a critical decision as to which variant represents the author's wishes, one has no need to fall back on the concept of a text with presumptive authority. Obviously one might, in such a case, choose a particular text to mark up to reflect these editorial decisions, but that text would only be serving as a convenient basis for producing printer's copy for the new edition and as nothing more. The reason so much attention has focused on the choice of copy-text is not that it is a necessary first step in critical editing but that in most cases variants appearing to be indifferent do seem to occur, so that one needs a principle for favoring one text over another. Generally speaking, an editor has less to go on when judging variants in punctuation and spelling than when judging variants in wording, and for that reason the text chosen as copy-text often supplies most of the punctuation and spelling for the critical text. But the editor is free, of course, to make rational decisions regarding spelling and punctuation when the evidence permits; conversely, variants in wording can sometimes seem indifferent, and the impasse is resolved by adopting the copy-text reading. It is not logically necessary, therefore, to distinguish spelling and punctuation from wording in arriving at a rationale for selecting a copy-text, for a copy-text is simply the text most likely to provide an authorial reading (in spelling, punctuation, or wording) at points of variation where one cannot otherwise reach a decision. The way in which spelling and punctuation may sometimes usefully be segregated from wording results from the fact that persons involved in textual transmission have frequently regarded spelling and punctuation as elements that they could alter more freely, or be less careful about, than the words; in situations where this generalization can be thought to apply, therefore, it will be one of the factors involved in editorial decisions. As for a general rationale for choosing a copy-text, one can draw on testimony from all periods, as well as on common sense and everyday experience, to show that texts can be expected to deteriorate as they are transmitted. It follows, therefore, that a copy-text should be an early text—one as near to the author's manuscript as possible, if not that manuscript itself—whenever the individual circumstances do not suggest a different text as the more reasonable choice. When they do, then by all means another text should be chosen: the purpose of the general guideline is not to restrict thought or to force particular situations into a common mold. One begins with the variants about which one can reason (from both external and internal evidence) and reach a conclusion; for any remaining variants, one must be guided by the trustworthiness—in general or in particular respects—that one can attach to each text. If this process leads to the choice of a later rather than an earlier text as more trustworthy, then one of course chooses the later text; accepting the general observation that texts deteriorate in transmission does not mean that individual decisions cannot constitute exceptions to the generalization. These comments on three central questions have been, as I say, intentionally brief and unadorned, both to show that the issues are essentially clear-cut (even though carrying out a responsible editorial policy may require some difficult decisions and certainly requires knowledge and insight) and also to demonstrate the cumulative effect of recent editorial discussion, for these comments, after all, grow out of that discussion and try to build on it. However ineffective some of the discussion has been, the level of discussion now is undoubtedly higher than it would have been without these years of debate. I hope that my summary can serve to suggest the most fruitful directions in which the discussion can proceed from here.</field>

There has been a larger number of rigorous review essays in this period, however, that examine particular editions in depth: see, for instance, those by Don L. Cook and Wayne R. Kime in Review , 1 (1979), 13-27, 105-122, and by Donald H. Reiman in JEGP , 73 (1974), 250-260. 7 This paper, written with advice on statistics from David R. King, was published in Language &amp; Texts: The Nature of Linguistic Evidence , ed. Herbert H. Paper (1975), pp. 123-146. 8 Proof , 1 (1971), 122-155. I have discussed this essay in SB , 28 (1975), 211-219 ( Selected Studies , pp. 289-297). 9 "The textual editor . . . is engaged in policing what he judges to be the randomness which in fact is inseparable from the process of textual transmission" (p. 129). 10 Some further remarks describing his disappointment with the Browning edition are quoted in Donald H. Reiman's thorough review of volumes 3 and 4 in Victorian Poetry , 12 (1974), 86-96. 11 It is not clear why Peckham believes that collating machines have served "to increase the amount of reliable data beyond the point at which it can be used" (p. 134). Indeed, his whole discussion of how "scientific instruments" serve to "undermine the theory responsible" for their invention seems a perverse way of describing how inductive investigations proceed. 12 Similarly, he objects to the "establishment theory of bibliographical analysis . . . that the history of the printing of a book can be recovered," because "the intrusion of randomness in the complex of interacting behaviors involved in printing a book is horrendous" (p. 131). But the "recovery" of any piece of history is always subject to modification by the "recovery" of still further data. 13 I should note, parenthetically, that another part of Peckham's article criticizes the typography and design of the CEAA editions, calling them "absurdities" (p. 137) and claiming among other things that "the format of most of the CEAA editions is too big, too typographically voluptuous," to serve as the basis for inexpensive photo-offset reprints (p. 138). There is no reason, of course, why large pages cannot be photographically reduced: an example is the use of the Northwestern-Newberry Edition of Melville's Redburn in the paperback series of Rinehart Editions (1971). 14 Resources for American Literary Study , 4 (1974), 131-144. 15 See his comments (pp. 142-143) on Hamlin Hill's "Who Killed Mark Twain?", American Literary Realism , 7 (1974), 119-124. 16 Later in the essay (p. 142) he deplores certain other arguments as "the angry kneejerk reactions of Mumford and Wilson." Reference to Mumford's and Wilson's pieces, and some commentary on them, can be found in SB , 28 (1975), 198-201 ( Selected Studies , pp. 276-279). 17 Baender places in a footnote to this discussion a variation of perhaps the most common cliché of criticism of the CEAA, the charge of rigidity of dogmatism. Here the CEAA inspectors are said to have derived from Greg "dogmas which are theirs, not his" (p. 135, n. 5). Baender's criticism on this point is more enlightened than many others', for he does not attribute the dogmatism to CEAA policy but rather to the approach of particular inspectors. 18 Published in Editing British and American Literature, 1880-1920 , ed. Eric W. Domville (1976), pp. 65-76. Domville briefly sums up the paper on pp. 4-5. 19 I have made further comments on this question in "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention," SB , 29 (1976), 167-211 ( Selected Studies , pp. 309-353). 20 Specifically, he says that what implies the existence of that routine is the metaphor of pouring old wine into new bottles. Presumably the allusion is to the title of Fredson Bowers's paper ("Old Wine in New Bottles: Problems of Machine Printing") at the second (1966) Toronto conference, published in Editing Nineteenth Century Texts , ed. John M. Robson (1967), pp. 9-36. But Bowers's paper is aimed at showing how the bibliographical analysis involved in establishing a text must deal with different kinds of complexities in different periods depending on changing printing technology. The metaphor of his title is not used to suggest "the existence of a proven editorial routine"; Katz's opening sentence ("Good editing is not just a matter of pouring old wine into new bottles") is thus not a refutation of anything asserted in Bowers's paper. 21 SB , 28 (1975), 231-264. An earlier version of this paper was read at a conference on editorial problems held at the Villa Serbelloni, Bellagio, in September 1973, under the directorship of Hans Walter Gabler. 22 Zeller states that "the motives behind the emergence and elaboration of the new Germanist theory are not the same as those implicit in such objections as have been raised against the application of the Greg-Bowers principles to the editions of modern American authors" (p. 231). Nevertheless, in dealing with the nature of authorial intention and the relations among versions of a work, it confronts some of the same questions that have often been raised in criticizing Greg's rationale and the CEAA. 23 I have commented on Zeller's paper in more detail on pp. 329-331 of "Problems and Accomplishments in the Editing of the Novel," Studies in the Novel , 7 (1975), 323-360. The German position as represented at the Bellagio conference is also alluded to by G. E. Bentley, Jr., in the introduction to the volume he edited containing the papers from another conference held six weeks later, the 1973 Toronto editorial conference— Editing Eighteenth Century Novels (1975), p. 7. Bentley contrasts the German practice of preserving "the copytext inviolate" with the French approach, represented by Roger Laufer (who participated in both the Bellagio and Toronto conferences), of modernizing a text "to make it accessible to students and scholars who are not specialists." Laufer's Toronto paper ("From Publishing to Editing Gil Blas de Santillane : An Evaluation of the Rival Claims of Practical and Ideal Editing," pp. 31-48) criticizes Greg's distinction between substantives and accidentals, misleadingly asserting, "Greg's theory comes really to saying that accidentals are so trivial that an author hardly ever bothers to revise them while emending words or sentences, but, nevertheless, the original accidentals should be preserved at all costs" (p. 37). Laufer believes that an editor should attempt to distinguish between significant and insignificant spelling and punctuation, retaining the significant and modernizing the other. But nothing that Laufer says about the nature of written language refutes the standard arguments against modernizing. He wishes his edition to be "contemporary" (p. 38), but serious readers will feel that modernizing puts an additional barrier between them and the historic text they want to understand as fully as possible and is thus self-defeating. (For a summary statement regarding the inappropriateness of modernizing in scholarly endeavor, see SB , 31 [1978], 48-50, or Selected Studies , pp. 498-500.) 24 My survey of textual work on the novel, referred to in note 23 above, appears in this issue, as does a useful list, "Textual Studies in the Novel: A Selected Checklist, 1950-74" (pp. 445-471), compiled by James T. Cox, Margaret Putnam, and Marvin Williams. 25 This "Forum" is made up of the following short contributions: Bruce Bebb and Hershel Parker, "Freehafer on Greg and the CEAA: Secure Footing and 'Substantial Shortfalls'" (pp. 391-394), which calls Freehafer's comments on Greg "thoughtless compared to what other scholars have been saying in recent years" but finds valuable his "criticism of CEAA textual policies"; Vinton A. Dearing, "Textual Criticism Today: A Brief Survey" (pp. 394-398); Thomas L. McHaney, "The Important Questions Are Seldom Raised" (pp. 399-401); Morse Peckham, "Notes on Freehafer and the CEAA" (pp. 402-404), which states that Freehafer's "strictures are not as severe as they could be, nor is his analysis as penetrating as it should be"; and G. T. Tanselle, "Two Basic Distinctions: Theory and Practice, Text and Apparatus" (pp. 404-406). 26 American Scholar , 45 (1975-76), 733-751 [i.e., 37-55]. 27 I have discussed parts of Shaw's article in more detail in two other places: in "The Editing of Historical Documents," SB , 31 (1978), 7-8, 54-55 ( Selected Studies , pp. 457-458, 504-505); and in "External Fact as an Editorial Problem," SB , 32 (1979), 31-34 ( Selected Studies , pp. 385-388). For Fredson Bowers's comment on Shaw's piece as "the low water mark to date," employing "the Big Lie technique" beyond "all bounds of decency," see "Scholarship and Editing" (note 31 below), p. 164, n. 4. 28 Proof , 4 (1975), 31-76; reprinted in his Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing (1975), pp. 488-528. A shorter version of this paper was his contribution to the Bellagio conference in 1973 (cf. notes 21 and 23 above). 29 In the light of all the controversy over exaggerated claims of definitiveness, one should note that Bowers here describes "as authoritative a reconstruction . . . as the documents allow." A scholar is limited to the available evidence and knows that further evidence may later become available; thus the goal of a scholarly critical edition is "to be the most authoritative and comprehensive that can be contrived for its time and place in the history of scholarship" (p. 528). 30 Todd Bender does not perhaps take Bowers's arguments for eclectic texts sufficiently into account when he talks about the "arbitrary limits" of a "printed code system" that allows only one reading to stand at each point in the text; but he does make a number of interesting points about the way in which a text in electronic form can hold all variants simultaneously, and he argues that such a text does not amount simply to a collection of documents but that it is instead "the primary form of the work ," for a work often implies a "range of possibilities." See "Literary Texts in Electronic Storage: The Editorial Potential," Computers and the Humanities , 10 (1976), 193-199. A good survey of the literature relating to computers and editing appeared soon afterward: T. H. Howard-Hill, "Computer and Mechanical Aids to Editing," Proof , 5 (1977), 217-235. 31 PBSA , 70 (1976), 161-188. Another essay of Bowers's during 1976, intended to provide a general summary for a much broader audience, is "Recovering the Author's Intentions," Pages , 1 (1976), 218-227. 32 One of his comments on Greg's rationale may perhaps prove misleading. He says that when a decision about verbal variants "seems indifferent to critical analysis, Greg suggested that the odds should favor the editorial adoption of the later reading since it appeared in a text that had general authority for its substantives" (p. 177). Greg of course, like McKerrow, did recognize that the authority for spelling and punctuation might lie in a different text from one that provides authoritative verbal revisions; but to suggest the adoption of all indifferent substantive variants from a text containing recognizable authorial revisions would amount to considering that revised text the copy-text for substantives, and Greg departed further than this from McKerrow's idea of placing the authority for all substantives in a text containing any authorial revisions. According to Greg, "a later variant that is either completely indifferent or manifestly inferior, or for the substitution of which no motive can be suggested, should be treated as fortuitous and refused admission to the text" ("The Rationale of Copy-Text," in Greg's Collected Papers , ed. J.C. Maxwell [1966], pp. 387-388). For Greg, the copy-text is the text to fall back on in the case of all truly indifferent variants, substantives as well as those in punctuation and spelling. 33 Greg specifically takes up Every Man in His Humour in the paragraph following the one in which these phrases occur, calling it the "classical example" of what he had just described in general terms. 34 As Bowers points out, "It is obvious from some of his cautionary statements about his own rationale that Greg would have agreed"—agreed, that is, that the "mechanical measurement of authority in the accidentals must give way to the special conditions of an author's revision of these same features on an equal footing with his revision of the substantives" (p. 181). 35 "The CEAA and Modern Textual Editing," Library , 5th ser., 32 (1977), 61-74. 36 His essay is not, in other words, part of what Bowers calls "an extremely contentious defense of the status quo and the familiar" that has characterized many reviews of CEAA volumes ("Scholarship and Editing" [note 31 above], p. 164, n. 4). 37 Obviously the spelling and punctuation of texts many steps removed from their authors (such as those dealt with by classical and Biblical scholars) have a different significance from those in autograph manuscripts or editions (or copies) derived directly from the manuscripts. 38 Which Davis expresses his indebtedness to. 39 I have no desire to claim any priority in this matter and in fact do not know who may have first looked at Greg's rationale in this manner. I simply wish to repeat here, as another way of stating the same thing, what I said in 1975 in commenting on Peckham's similar criticism of Greg's distinction between substantives and accidentals: "What Greg meant by a 'practical' distinction is one which, however mistaken it may be, has in fact operated to govern human behavior; and, since the editor is concerned with analyzing the behavior of certain individuals, such a distinction may be useful to him. . . . What I take Greg to be saying, then, is that the editor distinguishes substantives and accidentals not because he believes that he is making a valid conceptual distinction between two elements in written language but because the distinction is one which is likely to have been made by the persons who have been involved in the transmission of any given text (and which therefore may be useful in segregating different features of that text which may have been accorded different treatment)." See SB , 28 (1975), 213-214 ( Selected Studies , pp. 291-292). Cf. the earlier comment, in the summary of Greg, that "the focus is pragmatic—on the habits of individuals" (p. 174 [252]); or the view that Greg's position is based on a generalization about "the behavior of human beings in dealing with written language" (p. 180 [258]). 40 A very different use of the word "substantive" is carefully looked at by Bowers in "McKerrow, Greg, and 'Substantive Edition,'" Library , 5th ser., 33 (1978), 83-107. 41 If it is accorded to the later one, the question arises whether it should be accorded for spelling and punctuation as well as for words; to do so would of course involve the belief not only that compositors more accurately reproduced copy but also that authors normally made revisions in punctuation and spelling. 42 I use the phrase "compositorial error" because that is the one used by Davis; but this term should properly include intentional alterations made by compositors or others in the printing or publishing house. Such alterations would not be errors in the usual sense, since they would have been made intentionally. The appropriate counterpart to authorial revision, in other words, is nonauthorial alteration, whether that alteration results from error or deliberate change. 43 Davis's quotation of Greg's statement criticizing the view "That if a scribe makes a mistake he will inevitably produce nonsense" (p. 71) is not to the purpose since decisions regarding indifferent readings involve much more subtle distinctions than whether or not a reading makes sense. The passage in Greg where this statement is made occurs near the beginning of Greg's essay (p. 375) and criticizes the mechanical approach, derived from Lachmann, of considering it "scientific" to follow a copy-text whenever its readings "were not manifestly impossible." The main line of the essay, of course, is to set forth a rationale for departing from the copy-text, even when its readings are possible, if one finds later variants that can be judged authorial revisions; the rationale does indeed involve retaining copy-text readings when the variants are not convincingly authorial, but that is not the same as saying that they are to be retained whenever they are not "manifestly impossible." What Davis quotes as Greg's criticism of adhering to the copy-text when variants are indifferent is actually Greg's criticism of an earlier approach: the idea that one should follow all the readings, except those that are manifestly impossible, of the text that is "generally more correct than any other." The CEAA procedure Davis criticizes is in no way a relapse to this position. 44 He is wrong in thinking that definitiveness is "implicit in the notion of a seal of approval" (p. 73): the discussions leading to the use of the indefinite article in the wording of the CEAA seal ("An Approved Text") recognized that more than one approvable text of a work could exist. (Whether or not any kind of seal should be used is a different matter, about which there has never been complete agreement, even among CEAA editors.) 45 SB , 31 (1978), 90-161. 46 "Multiple Authority: New Problems and Concepts of Copy-Text," Library , 5th ser., 27 (1972), 81-115. 47 At various times Bowers argues for applying the same kind of editorial judgment to variants in accidentals as to variants in substantives. Cf. his comment from pp. 128-129 quoted earlier, or his remark (p. 128, n. 31) that Greg concentrated "on editorial freedom to deal with variant substantives" but had "little recognition of the comparable opportunities that exist with accidentals." Bowers is surely right to make this point, and in what follows I shall take up both accidentals and substantives as equally relevant to a discussion of fidelity in textual transmission. 48 The argument is sometimes made that the imposition of standard forms, when they exist, is something that authors expect. But this argument moves into the question of authorial intention, which I shall touch on below. At present the concern is solely with how much of the author's practice survives in print. 49 See, in particular, John Bush Jones, "Victorian 'Readers' and Modern Editors: Attitudes and Accidentals Revisited," PBSA , 71 (1977), 49-59. See also James Thorpe, Principles of Textual Criticism (1972), pp. 151-164; and SB , 28 (1975), 222, n. 90 ( Selected Studies , p. 300). Hugh Williamson, in the Times Literary Supplement , 15 September 1978, pp. 1017-19, expresses the opinion—in regard to both past and present—that "The printer believes that he has not only a right but a duty to amend the author's copy." 50 The other standard ironies of the situation are also present: thus the compositor is not to alter words, but he revises punctuation in order "that the author's meaning may be more readily apprehended"—which implies that he is able to understand the author's meaning despite faulty punctuation but that the reading public is better served by the compositor's punctuation than the author's. 51 Of the essays dealing with particular textual decisions in a single edition, special note should be taken of Hugh Amory's " Tom Jones among the Compositors: An Examination," Harvard Library Bulletin , 26 (1978), 172-192. See also his other related essays in the same journal: " Tom Jones Plus and Minus: Towards a Practical Text," 25 (1977), 101-113; "The History of 'The Adventures of a Foundling': Revising Tom Jones ," 27 (1979), 277-303; " Jones Papers: Envoi," 28 (1980), 175-180. 52 "Greg's 'Rationale' and the Editing of Pope," Library , 5th ser., 33 (1978), 119-124. 53 In connection with this point, he claims, "The corrector's role has been generally ignored by Greg and his followers" (p. 122). Whether or not this is true, the existence of the corrector reinforces the validity of Greg's general rationale. 54 Another point of Foxon's, to which he devotes a short paragraph (p. 120), is to criticize what he calls Greg's assumption that authorial spelling "should be recovered regardless of an author's wishes." His conclusion that certain of an author's "idiosyncrasies" are more properly preserved in a study (or transcription) of the manuscripts than in an edition of the works is not to be quarreled with; but the general line of his argument on this score seems based on an overly simple view of authorial intention, equating authors' statements or expectations with intentions. 55 References to, and an analysis of, these articles are provided in SB , 28 (1975), 202-211 ( Selected Studies , pp. 280-289). 56 Thomas Woodson, "The Title and Text of Thoreau's 'Civil Disobedience,'" Bulletin of Research in the Humanities , 81 (1978), 103-112. 57 "A Toot of the Trumpet against the Scholarly Regiment of Editors," Bulletin of Research in the Humanities , 81 (1978), 297-323. 58 When a printed edition is copy-text, Girling seems to imply that an editor can purge it of the printers' punctuation by using standard printers' manuals or handbooks of punctuation, like De Vinne's or John Wilson's (pp. 301-302). Even if printed punctuation had been as regular as Girling suggests since about 1850, and therefore as identifiable, one would still not know, in the absence of a manuscript, what the author's punctuation had been, or whether indeed it had coincided with the printers' practice. Girling is right to say that editors need to be aware of these manuals; but how an editor can avoid, in the absence of a manuscript, retaining punctuation from a printed copy-text, and thus inevitably some of the printer's punctuation, is not made clear. 59 For some comments on that treatment, see SB , 28 (1975), 224-227 ( Selected Studies , pp. 302-305). 60 Other weaknesses seem less important in comparison. One of them is Gaskell's seemingly irrational aversion to extensive apparatus. He repeatedly criticizes what he regards as excessive documentation; but characteristically his principal objection to a detailed record of variants is that it is "unreadable" and "unattractive" (p. 25). (Davis similarly refers to "massive lists of variants" that "invite themselves not to be read" [p. 74].) 61 Even though the focus of the chapter, as Gaskell himself points out, is somewhat different from the others, for here the principal subject is the CEAA edition, whereas in the others the emphasis is on the textual questions raised by the work, not on a particular scholarly edition (though some discussion of a particular edition is often appended). This shift of emphasis in this one chapter is itself revealing. I am limiting myself to this chapter here, because I have commented on Gaskell's book in considerably greater detail, giving some attention to each chapter, in a review in the Library , 6th ser., 2 (September 1980). 62 This passage in the CEAA Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures (rev. ed., 1972), p. 5, goes on to describe two situations in which a surviving manuscript would not become copy-text. 63 Vinton A. Dearing, in a helpful review of Gaskell's book ( Analytical &amp; Enumerative Bibliography , 3 [1979], 105-116), provides an effective criticism of this statement (p. 111). He also offers a fresh summary of Greg's rationale and concludes that it is "perfectly general," not limited in its application to Renaissance books. 64 His discussion of this issue in other chapters does not help. For instance, in the cases of The Heart of Mid-Lothian and David Copperfield , Gaskell recommends choosing the first editions over the manuscripts, despite publishing-house normalization, on the grounds that the authors were "content with the result" (p. 114) or "did not prevent these alterations from being carried out" (p. 152); but when he comes to Henry Esmond he is much more sympathetic to the manuscript, without explaining what makes this situation different in his view from the other two. (For some further relevant discussion of authorial intentions and expectations, see Jane Millgate's "The Limits of Editing: The Problems of Scott's The Siege of Malta ," Bulletin of Research in the Humanities , 82 [1979], 190-212. This unfinished manuscript, she says, brings into focus the question of "judging the kind and degree of supplementary intervention an author assumes his manuscript will receive, and how far it is legitimate for an editor to seek to recreate that intervention and regard it as in a sense part of the text" [p. 210].) 65 Another book of 1978— Editing Nineteenth-Century Fiction , ed. Jane Millgate, containing the papers from the 1977 Toronto editorial conference—includes some essays that should be mentioned here. Peter Shillingsburg, in "Textual Problems in Editing Thackeray" (pp. 41-59), makes a clear and succinct statement of the unexceptionable view that scholarly texts require judgment and that "there can be no such thing as a definitive text" (p. 47). His decision to "present first intentions" in his text of Pendennis is justifiable; whether he should do the same thing "even for works without the dramatic revisions of Pendennis " (p. 46) is less clear from the information furnished in the essay. If, in every case, what revisions there are serve to alter the overall effect of the work, he would of course have the choice of editing either the first or the later version; but if the rationale is to present first intentions in the text and later readings in the apparatus simply because that arrangement provides a more orderly chronological register of the variants, one could raise the same questions that come to mind in connection with Zeller's approach. Shillingsburg also includes an interesting discussion of Thackeray's "approval" of first-edition punctuation in Vanity Fair (pp. 55-57). He is aware that such tacit approval is not the same as intention, but he regards the manuscript as "inadequate" and in need of additional punctuation. A critical approach to this problem leads him to a sensible conclusion, one that is perfectly standard but nevertheless worth repeating: "the editor cannot hope to say that his edition recovers Thackeray's intentions, but only that he has tried to fulfil those intentions as his judgment and imagination have led him to understand them" (p. 56). Michael Millgate's paper, "The Making and Unmaking of Hardy's Wessex Edition" (pp. 61-82), provides a perfect demonstration of the way in which authors' acceptance of house-styling does not amount to their actually wishing to have their writing so punctuated. Hardy's texts, punctuated "carefully and deliberately in manuscript," went through a long process of "erosion and accretion"; he accepted "the heavier and more rigid punctuation imposed on his work" because in "his early years he must have felt too insecure and too busy to protest" and "later on it must have seemed unnecessary to worry over details that had been so long established" (p. 68). And the final paper in the volume, Hershel Parker's "Aesthetic Implications of Authorial Excisions: Examples from Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, and Stephen Crane" (pp. 99-119), is an effective plea for further examination of the concept of authorial intention in the light of recent work in aesthetics, speech-act theory, creativity theory, and related fields. He shows that when writers "merely delete passages without rethinking and rewriting extensive parts of the book" they "often do more harm than good" (p. 101); editors must therefore investigate the circumstances surrounding any authorial revision and be aware of the aesthetic implications of accepting the last revision as the one that best reflects the author's wishes. 66 "The Application of Thought to an Eighteenth-Century Text: The School for Scandal ," in Evidence in Literary Scholarship: Essays in Memory of James Marshall Osborn , ed. René Wellek and Alvaro Ribeiro (1979), pp. 321-335. My comments on some earlier related statements of Bateson's can be found in SB , 28 (1975), p. 227, n. 99 ( Selected Studies , p. 305). 67 Another essay in the same collection that touches on some theoretical aspects of editing is Tom Davis and Susan Hamlyn's "What Do We Do When Two Texts Differ? She Stoops to Conquer and Textual Criticism," pp. 263-279. The authors repeat a familiar criticism of Greg: that his rationale is unsatisfactory because it tries to substitute a rule of thumb for aesthetic judgment. They say that an editor who must "choose between two equally authoritative variants . . . can do so only on the basis of subjective and aesthetic judgment: there may be no possible objective rationale or scrap of external evidence to relieve him of this responsibility" (p. 275). But if "aesthetic judgment" is taken to mean a decision as to what the author would have wished and if there are grounds for making this decision, Greg certainly did not believe that a rule should stand in the way of such a judgment. The issue turns on whether editorial judgment is conceived of as being directed toward establishing authorially intended readings or readings that appeal to the editor's own literary sensibility. Davis and Hamlyn seem to be leaning toward the latter approach when they say that an editor, after consulting all the evidence, constructs a text "that represents his subjective perception of the work itself" (p. 277). Confusion about the role of subjective judgment in scholarly editing has been a principal problem with many such discussions, and the situation is not helped here by the introduction of the idea that a literary work is a "subjective construct, any physical manifestation being an approximation" (p. 276). Although one can argue that "The symphony—the play—does not exist wholly in any of its performances or published forms," the relation between a performance and a printed text is a very different matter from the relation among various printed texts of the same "work." One can agree that an editor produces a text, not the text, without agreeing with the reasoning that leads Davis and Hamlyn to that position. (Some brief additional consideration of authorial intention in relation to performed dramatic works occurs in John Bush Jones, "Editing Victorian Playwrights: Some Problems, Priorities, and Principles," Theatre Survey , 17 [1976], 106-123.) 68 "A Review of the Year's Research," Direction Line , No. 8 (Spring 1979), pp. 1-32. The review includes some comment on the articles by Davis, Foxon, and Bowers discussed above, largely stressing the importance of "editorial freedom" and suggesting that Fuggles concurs with those who believe that the application of Greg's rationale to later literature has somehow restricted such freedom. 69 His discussion of this point is a part of his remarks on my essay "The Editing of Historical Documents," SB , 31 (1978), 1-56 ( Selected Studies , pp. 451-506). 70 Fuggles's view that "it is easier to edit texts transcribing exactly" would not be agreed to by some historians. In a report on an April 1979 Mellon Conference on historical editing in Annotation , 7, no. 2 (July 1979), 8-9, William B. Willcox is reported to have said of literal transcription that it "takes too much time to do it properly." He is quoted as calling it a "theological approach" and "going wrong with confidence." (This report cites several other opinions, including the claim that "changing a dash to a period does not affect meaning, but adds clarification." It is reassuring to know that "The session ended without any clear consensus.") 71 Examining the decisions made in particular CEAA volumes naturally continues to be a valuable scholarly activity; but many of the comments about "CEAA editions" in general are of little use because they assume a uniformity among CEAA volumes that does not by any means exist. 72 This point applies to all texts; but obviously the editor's approach to the spelling and punctuation of an ancient text, the earliest surviving form of which is a scribal copy centuries later than the time of the author, will be different from the approach to be taken when texts survive that are contemporaneous, or nearly so, with the author. 73 Except possibly for some of the earliest works in a language, which might be said to require "translation," rather than simply "modernization," for the general reader. 74 "The Historical Text as Literary Artifact," in The Writing of History: Literary Form and Historical Understanding , ed. Robert H. Canary and Henry Kozicki (1978), pp. 41-62 (quotation from p. 42). 75 To argue, as some do, that such eclecticism is always improper because it violates the historical integrity of individual texts is effectively to eliminate the possibility of critical editing, even though it is sometimes asserted that each text individually can still be critically edited. Each one can, in the sense that critical judgment can be applied to the problem of detecting errors; but to rule out the adoption of revised readings from later texts artificially restricts the critical process, for some of the superseded readings may, from the author's point of view, have been errors as surely as the typographical errors are. To begin the critical process of emending a text but to stop short of adopting any revisions from a later text on the grounds that all those revisions belong to a subsequent period seems to imply the untenable proposition that all readings of a text except for the undoubted typographical errors (or slips of the pen) are the ones intended by the author at that particular time. Clearly, revisions in later editions do not necessarily reflect second thoughts; they can be readings intended all along but for one reason or another not previously substituted for the erroneous readings. The artificiality, therefore, of beginning the process of emendation but not carrying it through makes the resulting text rather unsatisfying in comparison with the alternatives of either reproducing the historical document without change or constructing a critical text that draws on all available evidence. 76 Quoted in Tony Schwartz, "Mixer of Elite and Pop," New York Times Book Review , 24 February 1980, pp. 7, 40-41. The fact that in this particular instance it was not a publisher's editor, but Dickens's friend Bulwer Lytton, who convinced Dickens to alter the ending is irrelevant to the main point being made.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">as doth a skryuener That can no more what that he shal write But as his maister beside both endyte. (John Lydgate, Poems , ed. J. Norton-Smith [1966], p. 52)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Unless he was prepared to make his own fair copies a medieval author was dependent on scribes for the dissemination of his work. A few authors have recorded their irritation at the shortcomings of this manner of 'publication', none more strongly than Chaucer in his Wordes unto Adam, His Owne Scriveyn , Under thy long lokkes thou most have the scalle But after my makyng thou wryte more trewe, So ofte a-daye I mot thy werk renewe, It to correcte and eek to rubbe and scrape, And al is thorugh thy negligence and rape. 1 Chaucer describes for us in general terms what the situation was: scribes were inaccurate through carelessness and hastiness and their work required constant revision and correction by the author. 2 In the case of John Capgrave we have what may well be a unique opportunity to examine just such a situation through concrete manuscript evidence, by collating a rejected copy (by an anonymous scribe) of part of Capgrave's The Solace of Pilgrimes with the author's own copy. Two aspects are of major importance. From the point of view of textual criticism in general it will be instructive to observe the extent and the nature of the errors which made a piece of copying unacceptable to an author. From the point of view of Middle English textual transmission it will be of interest to observe the linguistic changes made by a scribe working in an author's scriptorium. I have shown elsewhere what was involved for at least one medieval English author, Capgrave, in producing manuscripts fit for presentation. After he had first composed a work, the author then added fresh material arising from further thought or reading. Thus it could take some time to compile a finished work. The resulting 'original' manuscript was too untidy for presentation. A fair copy therefore had to be made. Sometimes considerable haste had to be employed in completing a presentation copy for a particular purpose. Either the author or another scribe (probably supervised by the author) could make this copy. Whether the copy was made by another scribe or not may have depended on the availability of a scribe whom the author considered at least as proficient as himself. [If the author was to make the fair copy he decided upon a script appropriate to the manuscript's destination.] If another scribe was to make the fair copy, the author went through his 'original' manuscript occasionally writing instructions so that the scribe could avoid any obvious blunders. Sometimes the author himself copied a difficult piece such as a diagram, even when the main body of the text was copied by a proficient scribe. The new manuscript was then carefully and extensively revised by the author. When the 'patron' was known, the author marked out certain passages for special attention, and occasionally added his personal mark at the end of the text. Lastly the manuscript was bound before being sent to its destination. [All this could take place in the author's scriptorium.] 3 Part of the evidence for these conclusions comes from three manuscripts which contain, in the case of [3], all that survives of, and in the cases of [7] and [8], fragments of Capgrave's 'The Solace of Pilgrimes'. These manuscripts are: 4 [3] Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 423, fols. 355-414 (SC 2322e); 5 [7] Oxford, All Souls College, MS XVII, 6 fols. i-ii and pp. 221-24; 7 [8] Oxford, Balliol College, MS 190, 8 fols. 116-19. Manuscript [3] is the holograph manuscript of Capgrave's 'The Solace of Pilgrimes', a description of Rome (c.1451), 9 written in the author's hand but not signed by him (the end is missing), and contains corrections by the author. 10 Manuscripts [7] and [8] are also from the author's scriptorium. Both contain Capgrave's Latin work 'De Fidei Symbolis' (c.1462) written by different scribes but corrected by the author; in addition the front endleaves of [8] contain a portion of the same text in the author's handwriting. The endleaves at both the front and the back of [7], fols. i-ii and pp. 221-224 (fol. ii and pp. 221-222 are ruled but contain no text), together with those at the back of [8], fols. 116-119 (fols. 116-117 are ruled but contain no text), form a consecutive portion of a copy in a fairly good current hand, not the author's, of Capgrave's 'The Solace of Pilgrimes'. 11 The text in these fragments is evidently unfinished since there is no rubrication (except for chapter-headings, which were evidently written in red ink as the scribe went along) and illuminated or flourished capitals have not been provided in the spaces left for them. The portion of text corresponds to the text in [3], the author's copy, as follows: [7], pp. 223-224 = [3], fol. 364 r (line 27) to fol. 364 v (line 33); [7], fol. i = [3], fol. 364 v (line 33) to fol. 365 r (line 35); [8], fols. 118 r -119 v = [3], fol. 365 r (line 35) to fol. 366 v (line 2). Since fol. 364 is the tenth leaf of [3] and since one leaf of [3] contains almost exactly 1.7 times the quantity of text on a leaf of the other copy I deduce that we have what would have been fols. 17-24, i.e. all four sheets of the third quire, of another copy of 'The Solace of Pilgrimes', but that this copy was abandoned at what would have been fol. 20 v (the centre of the quire) and put aside as waste (see Fig. 1). For convenience I shall refer to the version of the text in [3] as A, the author's, and the version in [7] and [8] as S, the scribe's. From the circumstances of survival, as endleaves in manuscripts produced in the author's scriptorium, it is evident that the copying of the S-version must have been discontinued and set aside on the author's instructions. Since there are no corrections or alterations to S as it has survived we must assume that Capgrave made his decision to terminate it on the basis of checking the now lost quires 1 and 2. Nevertheless it is probable that the reprehensible features of those quires are continued in the surviving third quire. The precise relationship between the two versions, A and S, has never been examined. Hingeston, who did not know of the existence of manuscript [3], the A-version, thought that the S-fragments were in the author's handwriting ( Chronicle , p. 356), a view now universally discounted. Because of what Hingeston called 'the . . . carelessness of the spelling' and 'the incompleteness of many of the sentences' he thought the fragments 'were only first and rough copies', i.e. a rough draft. This view was contradicted by Bannister, who formed the impression that the S-fragments 'formed part of a late copy which must have been made from dictation' (in Solace , ed. Mills, p. xiv). In order to find out whether these earlier views are true I have made a complete collation of the S-fragments with the corresponding text of A. The new evidence thus revealed shows that both the earlier views are erroneous. On a priori grounds it is probable that the S-scribe, working in Capgrave's scriptorium, was copying from an authorially approved exemplar, probably one in the author's handwriting; that exemplar could have been A but need not necessarily have been so since A is itself a fair copy and its existence presupposes an authorial original. As we might expect the relationship of S to A is close. This closeness is suggested firstly by the following sentence. 12 A S The kyng suppo|sed as it was þat The kinge supposed as | it was þat þe cite had sent him for to gete þe cyte had sent hym forto gete grace of þe | kyng and anon as he grace of | þe kinge and a none as he say him with a grete ire and a say hym with a grete | ire and a grete oth | he seide þese wordis grete oþe he seide þese wordis (365 v /27-30; Mills 31/7-9) 13 (118 v /16-19) 13 The only differences are in the spellings kyng/kinge , him/hym , cite/cyte , anon/anone , oth/oþe , differences which reflect merely the interchangeability of i/y , th/þ , and a preference in S for spellings with final e. Secondly, the close relationship of S to A is suggested, even more strongly, by the fact that spelling-features that are unusual in A reappear in S, where they are also unusual: for example, A's neuly (with u instead of usual w ) at 366 r /1 (31/22) reappears in S (119 r /6), A's f (instead of usual ph ) in profecie (365 v /38; 31/16) reappears in S's profe|cie (118 v /29-30), and A's y (instead of usual e ) in by for ' (365 v /39; 31/17) reappears in S's by fore (118 v /31). In fact, the relationship of S to A is as close as it could be: S is copied directly from A. There are three kinds of evidence which lead to this conclusion. (1) A and S share some common errors. The c in A's vescal 'Vestal' (364 v /27; 28/7) reappears in S's vescall ' (224/23). The first four letters of A's guynosopistis 'Gymnosophists' (365 v /3; 30/17) reappear in S's guynesopistes (118 r /15); for other Middle English spellings of this word see MED Genosophis . Wrong word order ( not before myth ) in A's þat þing whech he had not him\self/ne not myth haue (365 v /10; 30/23-24) occurs also in S's þat þinge | whiche he had not hym selue not myght haue (118 r /24-25). (This wrong word order was perhaps responsible for S's omission of ne. ) And the omission of the word him (after vndirtok ) in A's Tho þei vndirtok of his pri|de 14 (365 v /11; 30/24-25) occurs in S's Tho thay vnd|yrtoke of his pride (118 r /26-27) as well. This evidence could mean that A and S derive from a common exemplar or that S is copied from A. For reasons already explained A can hardly be a copy of S. (2) At least one error in S is most plausibly explained as having been induced by the line-division in A: S has all' þe places (i r /4) for A's Alle þe|se places (364 v /35-36; 28/15). If this explanation is correct S must be a copy of A. (3) One correction in A is wrongly incorporated in S in such a way that the conclusion that S was copied from A is inescapable. At 365 r /31 (30/4) A has þe pryuy ∧ of the world | ∧ þi n gis , where þi n gis occurs in the right-hand margin after the end of the line and the carets, in red ink, indicate that the word is to be inserted in the line after pryuy (see Plate I). S has þe pryuy of þe worlde þi|inges (i v /26-27): see Plate IIa. Evidently S must have been copied from A, and, when it was, the word þi n gis was regarded as belonging at the end of the line after which it occurs in the right-hand margin. Possibly S was copied from A before A was rubricated (hence the failure to take account of these carets in red ink—they were not yet there) but this possibility seems unlikely as a caret in brown ink at 365 v /11 was also ignored (see (1) above and n. 14). There are three possible reasons why Capgrave rejected the work of the S-scribe, (a) textual, because there were too many copying mistakes, (b) linguistic, because there were too many scribal alterations of spellings and forms, and (c) palaeographical, because its presentation was unsatisfactory. These reasons are arranged in probable descending order of importance: if (a) applies, (b) and (c) probably do not, except possibly as corroborating factors. To take them in ascending order of importance: (c) could hardly apply since the handwriting of S, though no example of calligraphy, is legible and reasonably tidy—the scribe's greatest fault (not a very serious one) seems to have been an inability to keep to his ruled lines, folios 118 v and 119 r having 32 lines to a page instead of the usual 31, and folio 119 v having 34; 15 (b) could apply—these nonerroneous scribal alterations are discussed in the third part of this article—but probably does not, as (a) certainly applies. Since A is a corrected authorial copy and S was copied directly from it and then rejected, all in the author's scriptorium, the information yielded by collating the two versions may be of use to those concerned with textual transmission in general. It should provide some guidance as to the kind of errors that were most likely to occur when a work was copied for the first time (primary errors), and their relative frequencies, as well as exemplifying a degree of inaccuracy which was beyond an author's tolerance. It should also provide insight into the nature and extent of those alterations that are purely scribal. Part II of this article is concerned with the scribe's textual errors, part III with his linguistic changes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II When copying from A the scribe of S made at least 85 errors in a passage which has 2398 (institutional) words in the corresponding Aversion. 16 That means that on average S has one error for every 28.2 words of A. By comparison, in A, there are 14 errors (12 of them corrected by Capgrave), 17 that is one error for every 171 words. So if all errors are considered (arbitrarily) as carrying equal weight S is 6.1 times as inaccurate as A. Evidently, purely on grounds of the frequency with which errors occur, Capgrave had much to be discontented with in S. As will be seen some of the errors had a considerable adverse effect on the sense of the text, often making nonsense of what Capgrave wrote. For convenience I have grouped the errors in S under three main categories, with further subdivisions. These categories, Errors resulting from Miscopying (i.e. writing something other than what was in the exemplar), Errors of Addition, and Errors of Omission, have a purely descriptive basis, and the arrangement of the material here under these categories is not intended to give rise to a mechanistic approach. Errors may have the same cause whatever descriptive category they fall into. The commonest cause of the errors in S seems to be assimilation, either to what goes before (retentive assimilation), e.g. in clennesse in chastite for in clennesse of chastite (1.1.17 below), or to what comes after (anticipatory assimilation), e.g. Of grete hors of brasse for A grete hors of brasse (1.1.25 below). Some other errors may have been induced by the line-divisions in A. Ultimately many errors seem to be due to the intervention of the scribe's mind, which worked haphazardly and often stupidly. 1. Errors resulting from Miscopying 1.1 Alterations in Wording On 27 occasions another word occurs in S for that used in A. Of these instances some 9 are probably due to retentive (1.1.17-22) or anticipatory assimilation (1.1.23-25) and 2 (1.1.26-27) may have been induced by the line-divisions in A. A S 1.1.1 mad (364 r /34; 27/6) and (223/9) 1.1.2 was (364 v /8; 27/20) shuld' (223/31) 1.1.3 ysid er 'Isidore' (365 r /9; 29/2) vsed (i r /26) 1.1.4 ston (365 r /23; 29/14) stonde 18 (i v /16) 1.1.5-6 þis (365 r /41; 30/13 (1st), and 366 r /11; 32/1) his (118 r /8 and 119 r /21) 1.1.7 schul (365 v /11; 30/24) shall' (118 r /26) 1.1.8 clad (365 v /17; 30/29) gl|ad (118 v /2-3) 1.1.9 an (365 v /26; 31/6) | and (118 v /15) 1.1.10 þou (365 v /31; 31/10) yow 19 (118 v /20) 1.1.11 an 'and' (365 v /38; 31/17) | on (118 v /31) 1.1.12 sitter (366 r /3; 31/24) aft er 20 (119 r /9) 1.1.13 þis kyng (366 r /18; 32/6) þese | king es (119 r /29-30) 1.1.14 mene 'means' (366 r /19; 32/7) meyne 'army' (119 r /31) 1.1.15 cam (366 r /38; 32/24) come (119 v /25) 1.1.16 su m (366 r /43; 32/28) þine (119 v /32) 1.1.17 of (364 v /27; 28/7) in (224/24) 1.1.18 se (365 v /5; 30/19) of (118 r /17) 1.1.19 neuyr (365 v /6; 30/20) euer (118 r /19) 1.1.20 sche (365 v /42; 31/20) þe (119 r /4) 1.1.21 ʒe (366 r /26; 32/14) he (119 v /9) 1.1.22 on (366 r /37; 32/24) in (119 v /24) 1.1.23 to (365 r /25; 29/16 (2nd)) and (i v /18) 1.1.24 men (365 v /21; 31/2) more (118 v /8) 1.1.25 A (366 r /7; 31/28) Of (119 r /16) 1.1.26 conse|crate (364 v /25-6; 28/6) contrite (224/22) 1.1.27 sekir | merkis (365 v /16-17; 30/29) sekernes (118 v /2) Half of these instances make nonsense of the text and at least seven others substantially alter the sense of what Capgrave wrote. 1.2 Changes within Words In 9 instances letters within words have been altered. One of these is probably due to anticipatory assimilation (1.2.8), and one (1.2.9) was probably induced by the line-division in A. A S 1.2.1 rose 'Rose' (364 v /29; 28/9) rese (224/26) 1.2.2 exam er on 'Exameron' (365 r /11; 29/3) epan er on' (i r /28) 1.2.3 guynosopistis 'Gymnosophists' (365 v /3; 30/17) guynesopist es (118 r /15) 1.2.4 fame (365 v /4; 30/18) same (118 r /17) 1.2.5 manslauth (365 v /12; 30/25) mon [ in monslaught] 21 (118 r /27) 1.2.6 naked (365 v /21; 31/2) nakod (118 v /8) 1.2.7 philisophr' (365 v /26; 31/6) philiphoser' (118 v /15) 1.2.8 senate (366 r /27; 32/15) senade | (119 v /10) 1.2.9 a|naximenes 'Anaximenes' (365 v /26-27; 31/7) a maximenes (118 v /15) At least three of these instances make nonsense of the text. There are also 2 instances where contractions in A have been expanded in S incorrectly. A S 1.2.10 p ro phecied (364 v /14; 27/26) prephicied (224/7) 1.2.11 a mong is (366 r /25; 32/13) a mon|ge (119 v /8-9) 1.3 Wrong Word Order Just as letters could occasionally be transposed, as in philiphoser ' (1.2.7), so too could words. All three instances were probably the result of anticipation combined with attempted correction. A S 1.3.1 in þe heith a boue was a temple (364 v /25; 28/5-6) in þe heyth was a boue a | temple (224/21-22) 1.3.2 and whi he was sette þere (366 r /7; 31/27) and why was | he sette þere (119 r /15-16) 1.3.3 þis schal be mad of brasse (366 r /31; 32/18) þis made shall' be of bras (119 v /16) In the first instance the sense is altered. 2. Errors of Addition Since S is held to be a copy of A there ought not to be many examples that fall in this category and those that there are have been carefully checked to make sure they do not constitute contradictory evidence. That the S-scribe was prepared to supplement what was in his exemplar is shown by the following three instances. All of them, however, are easily explained as copying errors. 2.1 Addition of Words A S 2.1.1 on to bettir vse (364 r /30; 27/3) onto þe better vse (223/5) Here one idiom has simply been substituted for another. 2.1.2 The Latin word capitulum is added to a chapter heading before the number xii (A 365 r /19 (29/10); S i v /8). What is implied in A is supplied in S. A S 2.1.3 At mydnyth loke e be redy alle in dikys and. . . (366 r /33; 32/20) at mydnyght | loke ye þer be redy all' in dykis and . . . (119 v /18-19) Here the construction has been changed so that some subject other than A's e is required in S but none is forthcoming, so the sense is seriously impaired by the alteration. There is one instance of straightforward dittography over a line division in S, possibly induced by the line division in A. A S 2.1.4 lich as I wil ride | Alle þis (366 r /30-31; 32/18) liche as I will' ride all' | all' þis (119 v /15-16) Here may also be included a similar instance where only the first letter of a word is repeated over the line division in S. A S 2.1.5 þ er for owt (364 v /41; 28/20) þerfore o | oute (i r /11-12) In three instances words have been added through retentive assimilation. A S 2.1.6 Too grete hor|ses þ er e be and too naked men standyng be hem (365 r /20-21; 29/12-13) To gre|te horsis þer be and to naked men | and standing' be hem (i v /11-13) 2.1.7 Tho hith he hem grete ricchesse and had hem in ful grete reue|rens (365 r /37-38; 30/9-10) Tho hight he | hem grete richesse and had hem in full' grete riche|sse and reuerence (118 r /2-4) 2.1.8 distroye a cite man &amp; woma n wal and | hous (365 v /24-25; 31/4-5) di|stroy a cyte a man and woma n wall' and hous (118 v /11-12) In all of these instances the sense is affected adversely. There is one clear instance of a word being added through anticipatory assimilation. A S 2.1.9 hath bore a | child (364 v /22-23; 28/3) ha | the a bore a child' (224/17-18) In another instance only the first letter of a word is anticipated. A S 2.1.10 mor' bou n de to do (365 r /11; 29/4) more bounde d to do (i r /29) Both of these last two errors are easily spotted and the sense thus recovered. 2.2 Addition to Words Dittography of groups of letters occurs in two instances, the second possibly induced by the line division in A. A S 2.2.1 euene a noon (364 r /39; 27/10) euenen anonone (223/15) 2.2.2 go|uernau n s (365 v /20-21; 31/1) goueruernauns (118 v /7) Dittography of a single letter occurs in a further instance over a line division in S. A S 2.2.3 philisophr' (365 v /31; 31/11) philosop | phir' (118 v /21-22) Dittography of letter-strokes (minims) also occurs. A S 2.2.4 coupled (364 v /17; 27/28) compled (224/11) 2.2.5 sumtyme (366 r /8; 31/28) sumityme (119 r /17) With the possible exception of 2.2.4, which as it stands makes nonsense of the text, all these errors are easily spotted and the sense thus restored. There is one instance of a word being added through retentive assimilation. A S 2.2.6 In þe tyme | of tiberi us þe emp er our' (365 r /24-25; 29/15) In þe tyme of tyberus oþe emp er oure (i v /17-18) Here there may be an element of syntactic confusion, the scribe perhaps thinking of a reading such as * þe tyme of þe emperoure tyberus *. As it stands the text is clearly rendered nonsensical in S but again the error is easily corrected. 3. Errors of Omission 3.1 Omission of Words In 7 instances words are omitted in S apparently through sheer carelessness. A S 3.1.1 was a | temple (364 v /33-34; 28/13) was temple (i r /1) 3.1.2 had not a gander' (365 r /6; 28/27) had not gandir (i r /22) 3.1.3 þe . . . puple . . . ded make (365 r /14-15; 29/7) þe . . . peple . . . make (i v /2-3) 3.1.4 as to a god (365 r /16; 29/8) as to god (i v /4) 3.1.5 euyr is þe maistiris wit a boue his disciple (365 v /34; 31/13) euer is þe meystiris aboue his disciple (118 v /25) 3.1.6 Thus was þe cite saued and þe kyngis ire softed (365 v /35; 31/14) th s | was þe cyte and þe kinges ire softed (118 v /25-26) 3.1.7 in þe eld cronicles (366 r /1; 31/21-22) in þe cro|nicles (119 r /5-6) In 3.1.3, 3.1.5 and 3.1.6 the construction gives a clue to the omission but not in 3.1.7. While the omission of the indefinite article in 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 affects the grammar rather than the sense its omission in 3.1.4 alters the sense radically. There is one instance of the second of two words ending in the same letter being omitted. A S 3.1.8 supposed not þat he had be of rome (366 r /43; 32/28) supposed not he had be of rome 22 (119 v /31) There are 4 instances where the scribe has omitted a word through anticipation, his eye presumably moving on to the second of two words beginning with the same letter(s). A S 3.1.9 ferd nevir weel ne neuyr stood (364 v /38; 28/17) ferde neuyr wele neuer stode (i r /7) 3.1.10 þei knewe su m me strau n ge þingis (365 r /28; 30/1-2) þay knewe straunge þinges (i v /22) 3.1.11 þat þing whech he had not him\self/ne not myth haue (365 v /10; 30/23-24) þat þinge | whiche he had not hym selue not myght haue (118 r /24-25) 3.1.12 swieres þat wer' keperis for þe body folowed fro ferr' (366 r /41; 32/26-27) swyers þat were kepers for þe body fro ferre (119 v /29) In a further instance of anticipation the scribe of S has omitted a word through moving on from an s at the end of a word to another s at the beginning of the next word but one. A S 3.1.13 as I suppose (364 v /20; 28/1) a suppose (224/15) Except for 3.1.10 all of these omissions through anticipation have a serious adverse effect on the sense. 3.2 Omission from Words On 3 occasions letters have been omitted from the end of verb forms so as to render them morphologically inappropriate. A S 3.2.1 spekith (364 v /13; 27/24) sp|eke (224/4-5) 3.2.2 seid p.t. (364 v /13; 27/25) sey (224/5) 3.2.3 named pp. (365 v /33; 31/12) name (118 v /23) On a fourth occasion the inflectional ending is omitted over a page division in S. A S 3.2.4 be tokneth (365 v /40; 31/18) be tok ∥ (118 v /32) The word these is deprived of its last two letters 3 times; on one of these occasions (3.2.7) the error was probably induced by the line division in A (see Part I above, under (2)). A S 3.2.5 These (364 v /17; 27/18) The (224/10) 3.2.6 þese (365 v /43; 31/21) þe (119 r /4) 3.2.7 þe|se (364 v /35-36; 28/15) þe (i r /4) There is only one instance of omission of a letter from the beginning of a word. A S 3.2.8 jor|nay (366 r /28-29; 32/16) ornay (119 v /13) In 7 instances letters which occur medially are omitted in S apparently through sheer carelessness. A S 3.2.9 sang ui nis (364 v /19; 27/30) sanguins (or (?) -gunis) (224/13) 3.2.10 tiberi us (365 r /25; 29/15) tyberus (i v /17) 3.2.11 satisfie (365 r /40; 30/12) satyfie (118 r /7) 3.2.12 likynesse (365 v /14; 30/27) likenes (118 r /30) 3.2.13-14 lat er ane (366 r /2, 3; 31/23, 24) lat er ne 23 (119 r /7, 8) On one occasion omission occurs medially through anticipation. A S 3.2.15 knythod (364 r /43; 27/14) knyghode (223/20) Presumably the S-scribe intended to write knyghthode but when he came to the first h he continued as if it were the second one. Except for 3.2.12, where the effect is to substitute another word, most of the errors in this section would probably have merely checked a reader before he recognized them for what they are. 24 From the frequency of the errors and their seriousness (at least 35 (41%) of them have an adverse effect on the sense of the text) we are clearly dealing with a good example of scribal 'negligence and rape'. If this example is anything to go by medieval authors evidently had good reason to complain about their scribes. Certainly Capgrave had ample reason to be dissatisfied with S and to reject it. Even when allowance is made for the possibility that there was a mutual understanding between author and scribe that the former would correct the latter's work—as indeed in a sense he did, by rejecting it—if the scribe of S had not been working in Capgrave's scriptorium under the eagle eye of a meticulous author 25 the copyist's work might well have gained currency. Unless an author was supremely vigilant the distortions and corruptions could set in under his own roof. The present instance of scribal inaccuracy may provide some pointers as to the nature of primary errors and their relative frequencies. Allowance should be made, however, for the possible idiosyncracies of the particular individual scribe. Perhaps the most notable feature of the errors is the high proportion due to retentive or anticipatory assimilation, some 16 (18.8%)—1.1.20-28, 1.2.8, 2.1.6-10, 2.2.6. By contrast there are only 5 errors (5.9%) due to anticipation, where the copyist's eye has moved forward inadvertently to the second of two words beginning with the same letter(s) (or to the second of two instances of the same letter). 26 A second notable cause of errors is line divisions: some 6 errors (7%) may be due to line divisions in the exemplar (1.1.26-27, 1.2.9, 2.1.4, 2.2.2, 3.2.7), and a further 3 errors (3.5%) occur over line divisions (or a page division) in the copy itself (2.1.5, 2.2.3 and (over a page division) 3.2.4). Taken together these two causes account for over one third (35.3%) of all errors. Thirdly, errors often occur in proper names; there are 7 different instances, one of them occurring twice, making 8 altogether (9.4%)—1.1.3, 1.2.1-3, 1.2.8, 3.2.10, 3.2.13-14. A partial cause of at least some of these errors is presumably ignorance on the part of the copyist. Ultimately several of them, and many others as well, must be the result of the intervention of the scribe's mind, albeit working haphazardly and often stupidly. It is hard to assess what proportion of the total number of errors are attributable to this cause but the figure could be quite high, perhaps 25-30%. Although 17 errors are classified under Errors of Addition, only one of these instances seems to be the result of a conscious attempt to alter the text so as to 'improve' it (2.1.3). This feature of the copyist's work suggests that while even a copyist working in an author's scriptorium scarcely had a modern scholar's respect for the authorial text, additions due to a conscious attempt to 'improve' the text probably constitute a very small proportion of primary errors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Besides the S-scribe's alterations to the A-text which constitute errors there are a large number of non-erroneous alterations of the kind that are usually referred to as 'purely scribal'. Here we are dealing exclusively with forms resulting from the intervention of the scribe's mind, albeit in the main working mechanically and sometimes haphazardly. We still need to learn more about such linguistic alterations; what is known has had to be deduced from collating and studying different versions of texts that survive in a fairly large number of manuscripts. As A. Hudson says, in the only detailed study of this kind (concerned with non-textual variations) known to me, 'Ideally one needs for a check a manuscript copied from a known exemplar'. 27 The present material provides precisely such a check, one that is all the more ideal because of the circumstances in which the copy was made—from an authorial copy in the author's scriptorium. It is hard to imagine circumstances in which the external pressures on a scribe to conform to his exemplar might be greater. 28 However, by the third quire (from which the surviving part of S's work comes), since 'having got into his stride, a scribe ceases to copy the dialect of his exemplar, but translates the text into his own', 29 the S-scribe may have come to terms to some extent with these pressures, such as they were. In Hudson's terminology the linguistic alterations made by copyists may be 'dialectal' or 'orthographic' ('Tradition and Innovation', p. 371). The basis of this dichotomy derives from the distinction made by the Latin grammarians (who got it from the Greeks) between two of the three attributes of a letter, its figura or written form and its potestas or phonic significance. (The third attribute of a letter is its nomen or name.) Attention was drawn to the importance of this distinction by D. Abercrombie, but there seems to be no basis for his claim that 'it is not easy to discover the relationship between figura and potestas' . 30 The clearest statement I have found is that by the sixth-century grammarian Audax: Figura litterae quae est? Qua notatur. Potestas quae? Qua in ratione metrica valet, cum aut producta est aut correpta. Et . . . figuram oculis deprehendimus, potestatem mente cognoscimus. 31 This statement is more or less the same as those by the earlier, fourth-century grammarians Victorinus and Diomedes, 32 except for the addition of the last sentence. In this sentence the distinction between the physical existence of the written form and the mental knowledge of its phonic value is a remarkable anticipation of Saussure's famous distinction between parole and langue . The difference between 'dialectal' and 'orthographic' alterations is that whereas a 'dialectal' change involves the substitution in the copy of figura B with potestas B for the exemplar's figura A with potestas A, i.e. there is a change in phonic significance (which would give rise to a different pronunciation) as well as in spelling, an 'orthographic' change involves the substitution in the copy of figura B with potestas A for the exemplar's figura A with potestas A, i.e. the phonic significance remains the same despite the change of spelling. An example of the first process, "dialectal" change, would be whech &gt; which where the figura 'e' with the potestas /ε/ is replaced by the figura 'i' with the potestas /I/. An example of the second process, 'orthographic' change, would be þe &gt; the where the figurae 'þ' and 'th' both have the potestas /ð/. Exactly the same distinction is made by A. McIntosh, except that he would call instances of 'dialectal' change 'spoken-language features (S-features)' and instances of 'orthographic' change 'written-language features (W-features)'. 33 Terminology is a problem. Since many features illustrative of 'orthographic' change can show orderly regional distribution the use of the term 'dialectal' in opposition will inevitably lead to misunderstanding. 34 If 'spoken-language features' is used instead then the Saussurean distinction between a mental knowledge of a figura 's phonic value and the articulated sound is blurred. The terms which offer the greatest potential for clarity are the Latin ones, figura and potestas , partly because there is no single English word that will serve as an adequate translation of the latter. I shall therefore refer to the first kind of alteration as FP-changes, ones where both the figura (or form) and the potestas (or phonic significance) are altered, and to the second kind of scribal alteration as F-changes, ones where the figura is altered while the potestas remains the same. With this distinction in mind I propose to examine the evidence. Nothing is known about the S-scribe except that he worked in Capgrave's scriptorium at Lynn. It is probably a fair presumption that he came from somewhere not a hundred miles from Lynn. But it cannot be assumed automatically that his dialect was Lynn dialect. Indeed, in view of the dearth of external information, the best guide to the S-scribe's dialect may be the linguistic data. When analyzed alongside comparable unpublished data from other sources the dialect-features of S would appear to harmonize with those attributed to the northern part of Cambridgeshire (Isle of Ely) north-west and west of Wisbech, 35 an area about fifteen miles from Lynn. This provisional placement, which is compatible with the external information, is based both on the features retained and on those altered in the process of being transferred from A to S. The argument for this dialect placement is as follows: (1) The form erde 'earth', in co-occurrence with -th for the pr. 3 sg. indic., indicates the general area to be East Anglia. (2) The absence of spellings with q- for the reflex of OE hw- , and of spellings such as xal 'shall', probably indicates an area west of the R. Ouse (but Lynn could hardly be excluded). (3) Given that the forms of the pr. 3 sg. indic. end in -th , the dominant use of spellings with a in 'they' ( þai , þay , etc.; see Appendix, §86), all of them alterations from the exemplar, restricts the area of likely provenance to a small sector of the overall domain of erde , and only the western half of this sector is consistent with (2). Taken together the first two factors, with a little help from the third, indicate a small area of N. Ely and NW. Norfolk bounded by Wisbech and Downham Market in the south and Lynn in the east. Narrowing the area down still further is, however, more difficult. (4) Within the small area of N. Ely and NW. Norfolk already delineated the form elde 'old' would indicate either N. Ely or Lynn. Unfortunately elde occurs only once in S, where it could be relict from A. (5) Given (4), there are a number of regular changes made by the S-scribe which suggest N. Ely rather than Lynn: A but &gt; S bot (Appendix, §5), A -th &gt; S -ght (Appendix, §35), A sey &gt; S say (4x, against retention of sey(e) 8x, Appendix, §73.1-2), A seyd/seide &gt; S saide (5x, against retention of seide 7x, Appendix, §73.3-4), A sch- &gt; S sh- (Appendix, §§75.1, 76), A worchip &gt; S worschip (Appendix, §75.3), A strength &gt; S strengh (Appendix, §79). If this analysis is correct one or two forms may be relict, notably S meche &lt; A mech , which occurs once only. The second part of this argument, (4)-(5), may well be right but seems to me to be rather less secure than the first part, (1)-(2) plus (3). Since in the present state of our knowledge of Middle English dialectology it is not always possible to determine whether a change made by the S-scribe is of dialectal significance or not I have listed in the Appendix all the linguistic alterations made by the S-scribe when copying from A. This complete listing is of value only because S is a direct copy of A and because of the circumstances in which the copy was made. In what follows references are to the numbers of the sections in the Appendix. The list in the Appendix includes over a thousand linguistic alterations made by the scribe of S when copying A, approximately one change to every 2.3 words. Not all of these changes are consistent—for example, S has cronycles for A's cronicles (§40.1.3) and cronicles for A's cronycles (§40.2.3)—and some are not sufficiently frequent to indicate a pattern. A few lead to the partial loss or partial blurring in S of distinctions that are maintained in A. For example, S occasionally has þus for A's þis (§87.3) and sometimes þis for A's þus (§88.2), so that A's distinction between the demonstrative adjective/pronoun and the adverb is effectively lost; similarly S occasionally has hem for A's him/hym (§38) and occasionally hym for A's hem (§85.2) so that A's distinction between the singular and plural of the oblique case of the third person pronoun is blurred; and by sometimes writing hir/hir' for A's her'/here 'their' (§84.2) the scribe of S blurs the distinction in A between hir 'her' and her 'their'. Most of the linguistic alterations, however, are consistent (or nearly so) or indicate predominant trends. It is notable that a scribe whose work was 'rejected' for its textual inadequacies did make a number of linguistic alterations with a fair degree of consistency. These changes fall into three groups:— (1) Changes which are of obvious potential dialectal significance. 36 Here belong FP-changes like A cherch &gt; S chirche (§6), A first &gt; S frist (§34), A puple &gt; S peple (§63), A whech &gt; S whiche (§93), and possibly A but &gt; S bot (§5), and F-changes like A sch- &gt; S sh- (§§75-76), and probably the elimination of spellings without gh in words like MnE might (§35), though this could be an FP-change. (2) Changes which may or may not be of dialectal significance. In this category come a number of alterations, such as writing ai/ay for A's ei/ey [38 examples in §§1.1.3, 1.1.5-6, 86.1-2, 86.3.1, against only 1 of the opposite ( ey for ai , §1.1.1) and that in a word, MnE master , which is subject to other variation (§1.3.1)], the elimination of double-vowel spellings for ME /ε:/ and /e:/ (§11) and for ME /&amp;c.nv;:/ and /o:/ (§55), writing -ed for A's -id/-yd (never vice versa , §§17, 19), writing -er for A's -ir/-yr [23 examples in §§26.1.1, 26.2.1, against only 1 of the opposite ( -ir for -er' , §27.2.2)], a preference for -es for A's -is/-ys [19 examples in §§30.2, 30.3.1, against 5 of the opposite ( -is/-ys for -es , §30.1)], writing -ith or -yth for A's -eth (§32.1), writing -ing for A's -yng except after letters composed of minims (§§44-5), writing qu for A's qw (§67), a preference for more frequent use of þ , especially final -þe for A's -th (§81), and writing y- for A's ʒ- (§97). When considered together the alterations made to several individual words may also indicate a pattern, one of preference for eliminating the 'unusual': for example, the scribe of S eschews ch in MnE besiege (§9) and ew in MnE endure (§25), prefers to include g in MnE assign (§43) and i in MnE reign (§71), adds final d to A's form of MnE should that lacks it (§76.2.1, but cf. §76.2.2), omits w in MnE not (§54), writes preve , the commoner ME form, rather than prove (§66), and dwelt , the commoner p.t. form, rather than dweld (§18.2), and does not spell MnE with(-) with ʒ (§95.1). The elimination of th -spellings for MnE -ght and in MnE little (§80) may also conform to this pattern. Presumably sum was preferred for MnE some to distinguish it from summe 'sum' (§77.1), words not distinguished in A. 37 Most of the alterations in this section are F-changes. (3) Changes which do not appear to be of dialectal significance. Even if some of the alterations included here turned out to be of dialectal significance it would not affect the general point that there are scribal changes which justify separate treatment in such a section. The dominant theme of these changes is a preference for 'fuller' spellings. This theme is illustrated by four main features:— ( a ) The expansion of abbreviations and contractions. Examples are A &amp; &gt;S and (§2.1), A con- &gt; S con- (§8), A -er &gt; S -er (§26.3), A -er- &gt; S -er- (§29.1), A -es &gt; S -es/-is (§30.4), A -i ng /-y ng &gt; S -ing'/-yng' (§44.1.2, 44.2.3, 45.2.2), A -m (-) &gt; S -m(-) (§48.1), A -n (-) &gt; S -n(-) (§50.1), A -n ne &gt; S -nne (§52.1.2), A -o us &gt; S -ous (§60), A p ar- &gt; S par- (§62), A p ri- &gt; S pri- (§64), A p ro- &gt; S pro- (§65), A sp eci al &gt; S special (§78), A þ t &gt; S þat (§82.1), A -ui- &gt; S -ui- (§92), altogether 112 examples. The predominant trend is confirmed by the S-scribe's treatment of Latin quotations and names: there are 18 instances of the expansion of contractions in Latin words, e.g., A S an ct us Nichola us in Carc ere &gt; S Sanctus Nicholaus in Carcere. Against this trend are 45 examples of the opposite (an abbreviation or contraction being substituted for a full spelling in A, §§2.2.1, 26.1.2, 26.2.2, 27.3, 29.2, 30.5, 48.2, 50.2, 52.2.2, 69, 77.2.2, 82.2, 87.2, 88.1, 94, 95.1-2) but 23 of these occur at the end of a line and were presumably induced by limitations of space. ( b ) The addition of final e . There are 215 examples of this feature (§13 and cross-references) against a mere 9 of the opposite (omission of -e , §§15, 77.2.1, 99.2.1) 1 of which occurs at the end of a line and was presumably induced by limitations of space. This feature alone accounts for alterations to 9% of all words in the text. ( c ) The substitution of -e for a final flourish. There are 38 examples of this feature (§§47.2.1, 47.5, 68.3) against 14 of the opposite (writing a final flourish for -e , §§14, 47.6, 84.2.3) 2 of which occur at the end of a line and were presumably induced by limitations of space. ( d ) The addition of a final flourish, ? for -e . There are 73 examples of this feature (§§12, 27.1, 47.1.2, 47.4, 51, 58, 68.1.1, 95.2-3) against 19 of the opposite (omission of a final flourish, §§27.2, 68.1.2, 84.1.1, 84.2.1) 1 of which occurs at the end of a line and was presumably induced by limitations of space. Since the flourish could in some cases be an otiose stroke its inclusion here as a 'linguistic' alteration is perhaps questionable, but the feature does seem to be part of a general trend; to treat it as a palaeographical (or, as McIntosh ('Scribal Profiles', p. 222) would call it, 'graphetic') feature (or sometimes as a paleographical feature) would be to separate evidence that belongs together. The preference for 'fuller' spellings is also indicated by a few relatively minor features, A betokneth &gt; S betokenyth (§16), A -ion &gt; S -iou n (§46.1), A my &gt; S myne (§49), A whan &gt; S whanne (§52.1.1), 8 examples in all; also a glance at the spellings for MnE should (§76) confirms that although four different forms are employed in S the form substituted is always 'fuller' than that in A. Against these minor features may be set 10 examples of -s for A's -es/-is (§30.6) and 1 of within for A's withinne (§52.2.1); the relatively high incidence of the former (against the predominant trend) would suggest that the alteration of A's -es/-is to -s may have had dialectal significance. A notable feature of these instances that run counter to this predominant trend is the high proportion of instances (27 out of 87, or 31%) that were presumably induced by limitations of space. Some other features are also presumably the result of limited space being available, especially A emp er ouris &gt; S emp er or is (§59), and A þe &gt; S þ e (§83.3.1). In view of the preference for avoiding double-vowel spellings (§11) the isolated spelling þee (§83.3.2), though recorded once in W. Norfolk, may well be the result of a desire to fill the space between the end of the word þe and the end of the line. Even as apparently elementary a consideration as the space available at the end of a line can affect the spelling of a word. All the alterations that belong in this section are F-changes. Hudson concluded that 'the forms which are unaltered [should be accepted] as part of the scribe's written dialect', and that, as a general rule, 'a scribe will only copy the linguistic forms of his exemplar when they form part of his orthographic "vocabulary"' ('Tradition and Innovation', pp. 371-372), i.e. he will make FP-changes, ones where in his view the phonic significance of a form in his exemplar does not accord with his spoken dialect, and also, though not always regularly, F-changes, ones where the forms in his exemplar do not accord with what would have been his regular orthographic practice had he been writing without the 'distraction' of the exemplar; for it is implicit in her conclusions that a scribe was prepared to perpetuate in his copy forms from his exemplar which, though within his linguistic competence, he would not normally have used in linguistic performance. Analysis of the material presently under scrutiny confirms these conclusions. It also yields information which allows more precise statements, statements which may be described as cautionary, about the two kinds of linguistic alteration, though allowance must be made for the partial nature of the evidence. In this case FP-changes form a very small proportion of the total number of linguistic alterations; this finding would seem to be only partly accounted for by the fact that the dialect-area of S is not all that far removed from that of A. Of the remaining F-changes a large proportion (over half the total number of linguistic alterations) do not appear to be of dialectal significance. Recently A. McIntosh has asked 'How far does a scribe, seeking to eliminate alien S-features [i.e. make FP-changes] in a text he is copying, take the further step of eliminating alien W-features [i.e. making F-changes]?' ('Inventory', p. 605, n. 1). From the present evidence it would appear that, even when allowance is made for the dialectal proximity of S to A, the S-scribe's concern was more with F-changes than with FP-changes and that he could not have looked upon the making of F-changes as a 'further step'. Indeed he could hardly even have distinguished between FP-changes and F-changes. In other words, the scribe was more concerned with textual transmission than with dialectology. Obvious as this conclusion may seem it is vital that it is not overlooked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix List of Linguistic Alterations made by the S-scribe when copying from A This list aims at completeness. 1 For the sake of brevity and simplicity the quotation of variants not relevant to the feature being illustrated is avoided (as far as possible) by printing the most common variant without qualification. No references are given and alterations in word-division (e.g. A a-boute &gt; S aboute) are not noticed. For convenience the alterations are numbered consecutively, having been arranged in alphabetical order (ʒ counting as y , y as i , if appropriate) according to sound, ME spelling, or PresE equivalent. Variation in the spelling of vowels in unstressed syllables is dealt with under e . A number in round brackets after a form in S indicates the number of times that particular alteration is made. When no such number is given the alteration may be assumed to occur once only. Instances which occur at the end of a line or over a line-division are noted separately but when such instances form part of a total that total is given first, e.g. A þe&gt; S þ e (6, 4 at line end), where 6 is the total number of instances of which 4 occur at the end of a line. A semi-colon is used to separate sub-sections, and the following abbreviations and signs are used: C = consonant; V = vowel; [square brackets] enclose supplied letters not in the MS; &lt;diamond brackets&gt; enclose letters written by the scribe in error; &gt; = 'is altered to'; &lt; = 'altered from'; + = 'followed by'. Bibliographical references to Dobson and Jordan indicate respectively: E. J. Dobson, English Pronunciation 1500-1700 (1968 edn), and R. Jordan, Handbuch der mittelenglischen Grammatik (1968 edn). 1 ME /ai/ 1.1 A maistiris &gt; S meystiris; 1.2 A aray, chayer, fayre &gt; S arai, chaier', faire (2); 1.3 A seide &gt; S saide (3); 1.4 A heith 'height', preising &gt; S heyth, preysing'; 1.5 A seyd &gt; S saide (2); 1.6 A ageyn, Godfrey, sey 'say' &gt; S agayne, Godfray, say (4); 1.7 A eythir &gt; S either; see also 86 they.

The phrase 'more trewe' seems to me probably to imply some tolerance of non-essential alterations which do not affect the wording. Cf.

Horstmann, EETS o.s. 100 (1893), xxxiv-xxxv. 7 The manuscript is paginated, starting at the beginning of the text (Capgrave's 'De Fidei Symbolis'). I refer to the front endleaves as folios by roman numeral. 8 See R. A. B. Mynors, Catalogue of Manuscripts of Balliol College, Oxford (1963), pp. 190-192. 9 On the date of this work see my 'Capgrave Scribe and Publisher', p. 3, n.2. The text is printed from manuscript [3] by Mills, Solace ; see especially pp. 26-32. 10 This was the view of Bannister in Solace , ed. Mills, p. xviii, confirmed in my 'Capgrave Scribe and Publisher', pp. 11-12, but recently questioned by E. Colledge in 'The Capgrave "Autographs"', Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society , 6, ii (1975), 137-148. Colledge's view, that the body of the text was written by Capgrave's 'secretary' but that the corrections are in the hand of the author, depends on whether the two hands are distinguishable. Although I believe the weight of the evidence is firmly against Colledge it is not my purpose to refute him here nor is it necessary. [See now my review of C. L. Smetana's Life of St. Norbert by John Capgrave (1977) in Medium Ævum , 48 (1979), 316-319, esp. p. 316.] What matters for the present purpose is that the text of the 'Solace' in [3] was revised by Capgrave and thus had authorial approval; on this matter there is no dispute. 11 See Plate II. Printed, very inaccurately, by F. C. Hingeston in The Chronicle of England by John Capgrave , Rolls Series 1 (1858), Appendix IV, pp. 355-66. 12 In the transcriptions the following conventions are used: (1) Italic letters indicate expanded contractions; (2) an apostrophe, ('), indicates a flourish which is added to some letters—almost invariably when they occur at the end of a word—and which may be either a mark of abbreviation, usually for -e , or an otiose stroke; (3) a vertical bar | indicates a line division (doubled for a page division); (4) \ oblique strokes / indicate letters or words written suprascript or added in the margin for insertion; (5) &amp; (ampersand) stands for the Tironian sign for 'and'. In the transcription of A the letters þ and y are printed as appropriate, although in the manuscript the y -form of þ is indistinguishable from y itself; whereas in S þ and y are distinguished in the manuscript. The distinction in both A and S between i and j is merely calligraphic and whichever is the appropriate letter is printed in the transcriptions. 13 References to A are by folio and line (without preceding 'f.' or 'l.') followed, after a semi-colon, or sometimes in brackets, by page and line references to Mills's edition. References to S are also by page or folio (as appropriate) and line, from which it is easily deduced whether a reference is to manuscript [7]—pp. 223-24, fol. i—or to manuscript [8]—fols. 118-19. 14 The word him appears in the right-hand margin after pri , and there is a caret after vndirtok to indicate where him should be inserted. 15 Another fault that should be noted here was the S-scribe's occasional failure to keep A's capitalization and punctuation. On two occasions the dropping of a capital letter is immediately preceded by the omission of a punctuation-marker so that a reader might temporarily miss the beginning of a new sentence. However, such faults would hardly have led to the copy being rejected as they could easily have been corrected during rubrication. 16 There are probably more than 85 errors but when there is any uncertainty as to whether a divergence between S and A constitutes an error or not I have given the S-scribe the benefit of the doubt. 17 The uncorrected errors are as is suppose (recte supposed ) at 365 r /42, possibly not an error at all as final d has been erased (see Plate I), and the example of wrong word order cited in Part I above, under (1). The corrections are all omitted words or letters inserted suprascript or in the margin, or repeated words or letter-strokes expuncted. 18 This form could possibly show excrescent d after -n though I know of no other instance of this feature in this word. In the context it is probably an error: S reads a faire conk of purphiri stonde be fore hir . 19 This error could be the result simply of a misreading of A's ambiguous y -form of þ but the effect is to substitute one word for another. Morphological substitution is unlikely as this is not a feature of the linguistic alterations in S. See further below, Appendix, n. 1. 20 This reading is probably right though the letter read as a could be the first stroke of an o followed by a minim and the letters read as ft could be st . 21 Mon for man is of course a dialectal variant associated especially with the W. Midlands but is not otherwise known in the area from which S comes; for the argument concerning S's dialect see below. 22 It is just possible that the omission here is a grammatical variation, the S-scribe preferring a zero-introduced noun clause, but if so it is the only grammatical alteration in the text. Cf. 2.1.1 above. 23 Cf. the spelling-change 'breþ er in' &gt; 'bretherne' (Appendix, §23.2). 24 The effect in 3.2.10 and 3.2.13-14 is also to substitute another word ('Tiber', 'lantern') but these words would be so inappropriate in their contexts that the errors would hardly have done more than check a reader (unless he was exceptionally stupid). 25 On Capgrave's meticulousness see my 'Capgrave Scribe and Publisher', pp. 5-7, and 15, n. 1, also my 'Consistency and Correctness in the Orthographic Usage of John Capgrave's Chronicle ', Studia Neophilologica , 45 (1973), 323-355, esp. 355. 26 3.1.9-13. For a discussion of the kinds of error that could arise from the movement of the copyist's eye from his copy back to his exemplar see E. Vinaver, 'Principles of Textual Emendation', in Studies in French Language and Medieval Literature presented to Professor Mildred K. Pope (1939), pp. 351-369, esp. pp. 355-360. 27 "Tradition and Innovation in some Middle English Manuscripts', Review of English Studies , n.s. 17 (1966), 359-372, quot. on p. 372, n. 1. Her study is based on manuscripts containing the metrical Chronicle formerly attributed to Robert of Gloucester. I am grateful to Dr Hudson for commenting on a draft version of this paper. 28 Indeed D. Pearsall has recently suggested that Capgrave had 'other scribes . . . working under his direction, producing copies of Capgrave's own works, in a standard "house style" of spelling . . .': in 'John Capgrave's Life of St. Katharine and Popular Romance Style', Medievalia et Humanistica , n.s. 6 (1975), 121-137, quot. on p. 123. I know of no evidence for this 'standard "house style" of spelling' and the present material would suggest that what 'standard spelling' there was in Capgrave's scriptorium was confined to Capgrave alone. 29 M. Benskin, 'Local archives and Middle English dialects', Journal of the Society of Archivists , 5 (1977), 500-514, quot. on p. 510. 30 'What is a 'Letter'?', Lingua , 2 (1949-50), 54-63, esp. 59. 31 Quoted from De Scauri et Palladii libris excerpta in H. Keil (ed.), Grammatici Latini (1855-1923), VII, 325. 32 Victorinus, Ars Grammatica , in Keil, Grammatici , VI, 194; Diomedes, Ars Grammatica , in Keil, Grammatici , I, 421. The statements by Donatus (Keil, Grammatici , IV, 368) and Charisius (Keil, Grammatici , I, 7) are less full. The fifth-century grammarian Priscian expresses the relationship slightly differently—and less perspicuously: Figurae accidunt quas videmus in singulis literis. Potestas autem ipsa pronuntiatio, propter quam et figurae et nomina facta sunt (Keil, Grammatici , II, 9). 33 'Towards an Inventory of Middle English Scribes', Neuphilologische Mitteilungen , 75 (1974), 602-624, quotations on p. 603. 34 Properly 'dialectal' is correct since dialect has always meant 'regional speech' (rather than writing), as in all the instances cited by OED and OEDS Dialect . However, in much the same way as the original meaning of atom 'that which is indivisible' was changed by the splitting of the atom, so the recognition that 'orthographic' or 'W-features' are regionally distributed in an orderly way in Middle English effectively introduces a new sense for dialect : 'subordinate variety of a language (of a past period) characterized by distinctive written forms which may or may not signify distinctive pronunciations'. Henceforth in this article the word 'dialectal' is used with the sense 'pertaining to dialect (in the sense given)'. 35 For this analysis I am indebted to Mr Michael Benskin and Mrs Margaret Laing both of whom are working on ME dialectology in association with Professor Angus McIntosh at Edinburgh. Since their material is unpublished I have not been able to verify it. I am grateful to Mr Benskin for his very full answers to my queries. 36 By 'of dialectal significance' I mean 'showing an orderly geographical distribution in the area concerned'. 37 For spelling distinctions of this kind observed by Capgrave see my 'Consistency in Orthographic Usage', p. 351. 1 A change not listed is that, whereas A uses a y -form of þ so tha t þ and y are indistinguishable in shape, in S þ and y are distinguished. I regard this as a palaeographical rather than linguistic feature, though it can have textual consequences (see Part II above, §1.1.10 and n. 19) and may show regional distribution (see McIntosh, 'Inventory', p. 609). 2 Since n and u are indistinguishable this spelling could be an error with the nasal titulus omitted. Cf. A strau n ge &gt; S straunge (2). 3 On spellings with ch see my 'Consistency in Orthographic Usage', p. 332. 4 This variation probably derives from OF Bretaigne beside L Brittania ; cf. my 'Consistency in Orthographic Usage', p. 343, n. 1. 5 This form is from OE strengu (OED Strengh sb.) rather than strengðu (OED Strength sb.) and could perhaps therefore be regarded as word-substitution rather than spelling variation. 6 This is a possible form of 'yet' (see Dobson, §422 and n.2), but in the context, A as ʒet is sene &gt; S as it is sene, it would probably have been read in S as a pronoun.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Shrinking Compositor A of the Shakespeare First Folio by Gary Taylor</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This paper will attempt to establish that Jaggard's Compositor A did not set any of the First Folio pages of 1 Henry IV , 2 Henry IV , Henry VIII , Hamlet , and Troilus and Cressida . This in itself may not seem too surprising: of these plays Charlton Hinman himself originally attributed securely to A only the x-case pages in Troilus , and a little more than one page in 2 Henry IV . What may seem more surprising is that the peculiarities of these five plays apparently can only be satisfactorily explained by the presence of three (or possibly even four) compositors, none of whom is seen else-where in the Folio. Compositor A was first identified by E. E. Willoughby in 1932, 1 and it was long assumed that he and Compositor B were alone jointly responsible for setting the entire volume. Charlton Hinman's identification of C and D significantly reduced A's share of the volume, 2 and this share has since been further diminished by T. H. Howard-Hill's identification of F. 3 Our interpretation of what is left of A will be significantly affected by our answers to two remaining questions: whether A was responsible for the x-case pages in 1 Henry IV , 2 Henry IV , Henry VIII , and Hamlet , which Hinman attributed to C* (= C or A) and A* (= A or C); and whether he was responsible for the x-case pages of Folio Troilus and Cressida . It will immediately be seen that, if A was not involved in setting these plays, he never worked on a simple reprint, while both plays which he set from printed copy ( Richard II and Richard III ) involve disputes about which quarto was used. Moreover, as part of the evidence of printed copy for Folio Hamlet and 2 Henry IV is based on Alic Walker's identification of A in those texts, re-attribution of those stints to another compositor might partially undermine that hypothesis. 4 In any case, doubts about the Folio copy for those two plays—and it is possible to have doubts, even if A's presence is accepted 5 —in themselves seriously complicate any identification of the compositors involved. Adding to these difficulties is the fact that, although the problems of attribution in these five plays obviously interrelate and overlap, the solutions (apparently) do not: there is no simple and single piece of new evidence which neatly isolates or excludes A in all five. Consequently, we must first approach each problem separately, only gradually relating these tentative individual solutions to each other and to the larger pattern of Folio composition. Hinman himself later retracted his doubts about A's presence in 1H4 , 6 but he gave no reason for his retraction, and the arguments on which those doubts were founded have never been refuted. However, it is now possible to rule out entirely C's participation in any of Hinman's C* and A* pages, or in Troilus , for none of those pages contain the frequent terminal spaced commas in short lines which Howard-Hill (pp. 68-69) has since identified as a near-infallible indicator of C's presence. But the elimination of C does not guarantee the presence of A, particularly since Howard-Hill's discovery of F in the Comedies has opened up the possibility, as yet unexplored, that another compositor, in some ways indistinguishable from A, may have set portions of the Folio histories and tragedies. Hinman himself had no reservations about assigning A the non-B pages in Troilus . Robert Lawson doubted the attribution to A, but this denial was part of a larger thesis which, being founded on methodological quicksand, has found few supporters (though some of Lawson's individual observations have been scavenged or expanded). 7 Similarly, the doubts of A. S. Cairncross about A's presence have been generally dismissed as part of his tendency to see Compositor E everywhere. 8 Alice Walker did notice that 'the work of the normally-reliable Compositor A went to pieces' in Troilus , 9 but she simply attributed this to haste 10 —an explanation which is of course circular, in that virtually the only evidence for haste is the deterioration in A's performance. Fluctuations in a compositor's standard of accuracy are by no means presumptive proof that his identification should be revised (as Paul Werstine's study of B has shown 11 ), but in this case the really remarkable contrast between 1 Henry IV and Troilus coincides with changes in a number of important spelling habits. 12 Moreover, it must be remembered that the orthodox identification of A in Troilus is based upon a few spelling variants which, we now realize, could be the work of D or F as easily as A. Therefore, although there is a substantial case for the presence of an A-type compositor, there is no real evidence which specifically points to A himself rather than D or F. The problem pages in Troilus must immediately be divided in half, by a count of spaces after medial commas in short (unjustified) lines. 13 Two distinct patterns (one indicated by a dagger) seem discernible, as is shown by a list of case x pages, in order of composition: ¶4 10 spaced/ 8 not spaced; ¶4 v 32/9; ¶5 29/7; ¶5 v τ3/21; ¶6 22/10; ¶6 v 38/15; ¶¶3 v 36/34; ¶¶3 26/23; ¶¶4 v (lower b) 3/3; ¶¶2 v 36/18; ¶¶5 22/22; ¶¶2 17/21; ¶¶5 v 22/20; ¶¶1 v 12/11; ¶¶6 24/32; ¶¶1a 10/14; ¶¶1b τ2/9; ¶¶6 v a τ4/34; ¶¶6 v b 13/11; ¶¶¶1 †8/28; χ1 v †1/18 Alongside one compositor who mixes spaced and unspaced commas freely, with the spaced clearly predominating on some pages, there seems to be another who very strongly preferred not to space, by a ratio of about 4-to-1 or better. Compositor C prefers to space after commas in short lines; A, D, and F do not. Since such psycho-mechanical evidence is (generally) of the most reliable kind, we are justified in tentatively conjecturing that two different compositors worked from case x on Troilus ; and moreover, since A, D, and F prefer not to space after medial commas in short lines, while C (who does) has already been ruled out by the absence of terminal spaced commas, we are also justified in conjecturing that one of these two compositors is an as-yet-unidentified workman who set sigs. ¶5 v , ¶¶1b, ¶¶6 v a, ¶¶¶, and χ1 v . In what follows I will refer to the spaced pages as 'H1's' and the non-spaced pages as 'H2's'. 14 First I will consider the evidence in these two stints separately, beginning with H1; and then I will try to relate them. Compositor A, in the stints now universally attributed to him, set the noun devil , plural or singular, 20 times. All 20 times he capitalized it, once against copy ( R3 696). Moreover, if A was B's partner in 1H4 , he set the word another 15 times, capitalizing it each time, 6 of these times against copy. In Troilus H1 set the word 9 times, 8 of those times without a capital; on all 9 occasions, he accepted the form of his Q copy. Disregarding 1H4 and Troilus , Compositor A on 19 occasions spelled devil (singular, plural, or adjective devilish ) de-; only 4 times did he spell it di-, 3 of these involving the adjective and 1 following copy ( R3 2031). In 1H4 , B's partner used de- all 15 times, all 15 against copy. In Troilus , H1 used di- all 9 times, in each case simply reproducing the spelling of his copy. A similar pattern emerges with the word heaven ( s ). Compositor A consistently capitalizes it: 80 out of 82 times, 13 of those 80 against copy. In 1H4 , B's partner capitalized the word 3 times against copy, only once following his copy's minuscule. In Troilus , H1 capitalized it on only 2 out of 16 occasions: once at the beginning of a verse line (where it had to be capitalized; this instance must therefore be discounted), and once following copy. Two conclusions seem to follow from this evidence. First, whoever was B's partner in 1H4 did not set the H1 pages in Troilus ; second, A did not set the H1 pages in Troilus . The deduction that A was B's partner in 1H4 , though suggested, is not of the same order of certainty, because it depends upon a mere agreement of those patterns in 1H4 with patterns elsewhere in A's work, and it is possible that another compositor besides A might share those traits. Further support for re-assigning the H1 pages comes from the word young . A had a very strong preference for young (48 times, 9 against copy, to 2 for yong , once following copy); H1 in Troilus spelled it yong on all 9 occasions, 3 of these representing departures from copy young , and 1 of these departures occurring in an unjustified line. A also had a strong preference for deare (46, to 4 deere); in the H1 stints deere occurs 13 times, and although all but one of these follows copy, compared to 4 for all A's other stints the number is still remarkable. 1H4 (C-or-A) A TRO (H1) TRO (H2) Devil {capital 15 20 1 0 {minuscule 0 0 8 0 {de- 15 19 0 0 {di- 0 4 9 0 Heavens {capital 3 80 1 0 {minuscule 1 2 14 2 {young 48 0 0 {yong 2 9 2 {deare 46 4 0 {deere 4 13 0 It thus seems clear that A was not responsible for the H1 stints, and it can now be demonstrated that neither F nor D nor C was responsible for any of the x-case pages. C can be quickly ruled out, since the absence of terminal spaced commas is reinforced by the virtually complete suppression of his preferred form heere , which is altered to here 8 times, and retained only 3 times (once justified). The non-B pages of Troilus also show a clear predominance of the traits used to distinguish D from F: consistent use of the long form of the catchword (F is inconsistent); consistent centring of the second line of stage directions (F is inconsistent); 15 retentions (5 unjustified) of copy sweete and 16 alterations (6 unjustified) of copy sweet to sweete (F has an absolute preference for the short form); 24 retentions of copy -le in heele , sheele , weele , youle (F has an absolute preference for -'ll). The spellings of beauty , heavy , pitty , and pretty also argue strongly against F. 15 Alongside this evidence against F or C is (taken in conjunction with the spacing pattern) similarly convincing evidence against D. There are no occurrences of anie , verie , euerie , ladie ( s ), or eie ( s ), though D elsewhere prefers these forms, often altering copy to impose them. The form 'ith , which D elsewhere does not use, occurs three times (though all derive from copy). D prefers mistris ; in Troilus the word is spelled mistresse all 3 times, once against copy. D elsewhere has an absolute preference for maide and meete ; at Troilus 1824, an unjustified line, the Folio has Maids (Q1 Mayds ), and twice it prints meet against copy meete (though on both occasions in justified lines). The number of indented flow-overs is also far fewer than we would expect: 2 in 14 pages, as against an average of 2 or more per page in the Comedies. These suspicions are compounded when D's consistent accuracy in the Comedies is contrasted with the volume of unanimously-rejected readings in the x-case stints of Troilus : 171, by my count. 16 Even granting à la Honigmann that some of these may be authorial variants and first thoughts faithfully reproduced in the Folio but rejected by the editorial tradition, 17 a very large proportion of these unanimously-rejected readings are unmistakably errors, and the number and kind of such errors is markedly uncharacteristic of D's work elsewhere. 18 It thus seems clear that the H1 pages could not have been set by any known Folio compositor, while the H2 stints could not have been set by C, D, or F, the three A-type compositors. But there is equally good evidence that the H2 stints were not set by Compositor A, either. Compositor A prefers deed ( s ) to deede ( s ) by a margin of 38 to 3; but H2 in Troilus set deed ( s ) only once—in a justified line, and following copy (1688)—and deede ( s ) 5 times, 4 in unjustified lines, and 3 times against copy deed ( s ). Second, Compositor A capitalizes Heaven 80 out of 82 times, 13 against copy; but H2 in Troilus , encountering the word twice, twice let Q1's minuscule stand. Third, Compositor A prefers young to yong by a margin of 48 to 2; but H2 in Troilus once changed copy young to yong (2064), in an unjustified line, and in the word's only other occurrence retained copy yong (3444, justified). Fourth, Compositor A prefers traytor to traitor by a margin of 42 to 4; but H2 in Troilus , setting the word four times, twice accepted copy i , and once—in an unjustified line— altered copy y to i (3435). At this point, enter the computer. After this investigation was completed (manually), I was able to test its conclusions with the help of computer-prepared concordances to the stints of the relevant Folio compositors. These concordances were prepared by pooling tapes belonging to Oxford University Press (those prepared for the Oxford Shakespeare Concordances) with others privately prepared by Dr Trevor Howard-Hill. Mr Lou Burnard of the Oxford University Computing Service supplied the programming and Miss Christine Avern-Carr helped him prepare and check the text tapes. Concordances were made of the stints of all the Folio compositors, with separate concordances to the stints under examination in this essay. The computer turned up a good deal more evidence casting doubt on whether A set the H2 pages in Troilus . H2 set sweete 13 times (5 against copy) and sweet 3 times; A preferred sweet by 58 to 1. H2 set duetie in the word's only occurrence, against copy (1628); A set dut ( ie/y ) 23 times, and duetie never. H2 set maister twice, once against copy (3535), and master once, following copy (39); A set master 79 times, and maister never. H2 set Voice once, following copy (88); A preferred voyce by 42 to 3. H2 set beate ( s ) both times he met the word, once against copy (1668); A preferred beat ( s ) by 23 to 1. H2 set months for copy monthes (3588); A spelled moneths 8 of 8 times. H2 set bloud 5 times, once against copy (1601), and blood never; A preferred the latter 120 to 7. H2 set goe 5 times, only once against copy, and accepted copy go 4 times; A preferred goe 189 to 9. H2 set meete , plucke , and indeede the only time he met each word, the last against copy; A strongly preferred all 3 shorter forms. Considering that there are only 3219 words in the H2 stints, the bulk and consistency of this evidence is remarkable, and the conclusion that H2 cannot have been Compositor A seems indisputable. It therefore appears that neither the H1 nor the H2 stints in Troilus can have been set by any known Folio compositor. But the possibility remains that H1 and H2 were in fact the same man; so far the only evidence which distinguishes them is the use of spaced and non-spaced medial commas. H1 seems to be more tolerant of copy do : in his stints it is accepted 9 times (2 justified), but it is never accepted in the H2 stints. (In A's work do occurs only 26 times, and doe 376.) But the force of this evidence is somewhat diminished by the fact that H2 only encounters copy do 9 times, while H1 encounters it 52 times. In the H1 stints copy suddenly is re-spelled sodainely (2419); in H2's stints copy sodaine becomes sudden (75). But H1 also accepts copy suddenly once (3272). H2 seems more tolerant of copy go ; as I have already said, he accepts it four times, only altering it once, while H1 accepts it four times and alters it 29 times. But this turns out to be poor evidence too, because in both stints most of the accepted go spellings occur in the interjection 'Go to', which is never spelled goe ; this applies to 2 of the 4 occurrences of go in H1 (1542, 1831), and 3 of the 4 occurrences in H2 (77, 1685, 1685). H1 seems to prefer shorter speech prefix forms. H1 shortens copy Pan to Pa 11 times, copy Nest to Nes 6 times, and copy Agam or Aga to Aga or Ag 14 times. Compositor H2 on the other hand once expands copy Aga to Agam (its only appearance in his stints), once expands copy Pan to Pand (elsewhere adopting copy Pan ), and once retains copy Nest . All of this evidence is meagre, and would never in itself have been regarded as sufficient to justify a distinction between two workmen. But in fact this absence of evidence is even more disturbing than it looks. All previous investigations of compositorial spelling habits have been based on manually-collected tests of certain sample spellings; in these circumstances, a failure to turn up spelling evidence may result simply from a failure to check the right spellings. But in this case I have been able, with the help of the computer concordances, to check every spelling in both stints; and there are no differences between them. (I have disregarded cases where a contradictory spelling appears in a justified line, or simply follows copy.) This absence of spelling distinctions would be difficult to swallow in any circumstances; it is absolutely incredible when, as here, we are able to test both quantitative and qualitative evidence, comprehensively. I am therefore forced to conclude that the evidence of medial spaced commas, usually so reliable, is not reliable here. This may be partly due to the inherent difficulty in distinguishing, in some cases, whether or not a space has been used; the test is sometimes more subjective than it appears. Moreover, even by my original counts, the proportions fluctuate considerably: from 24/32 to 32/9 for H1, and from 1/18 to 8/28 for H2. The x-case compositor in Troilus may have been affected by a sparsity of space-types, or influenced by his printed copy, or been inconsistent about this particular feature of his setting. Whatever explanations we advance (and however these might in turn affect attributions elsewhere in the Folio), I think that the spaced-comma distinction must here bow to the complete absence of supporting evidence. H1 and H2 thus seem to me to be a single new workman, H. The problem raised by the four remaining plays, 1 Henry IV , 2 Henry IV , Henry VIII , and Hamlet , and the pages in them which Hinman attributed to C* (C-or-A), is in fact two separate problems, one of which can be solved much more easily than the other. The x-case pages in Henry VIII and Hamlet were clearly not set by Compositor A, and just as clearly not set by the compositor who worked with B on 1 and 2 Henry IV . Hinman's own very strong evidence against A's presence here is confirmed by speech prefixes as well as a number of spellings. 19 (Tabulations of A preferences do not include the H pages in Troilus .) 1 &amp; 2H4 (C*) H8 &amp; HAM (C*) A {long catchwords 9 0 43 {short catchwords 1 7 0 { King. 32 3 (over 100) { Kin. 0 59 1j centre-rule distribution normal anomalous normal {Devil(l) 17 0 19 {Divel(l) 0 5 4 {heavie 4 0 24 {heavy 0 1 1 {soldier(s) 0 1 0 {souldi(e/ou)rs 12 0 90 In addition, there is the high frequency of heere spellings (27, to 12 of here ), which Hinman remarked on in the H8 and Hamlet stints. But, as I said initially, C himself is ruled out by the absence of terminal spaced commas in these pages. C, D, and H consistently use long catch-words. F is ruled out by the clear preference for -le instead of -ll. D, F, and H, like A, strongly prefer here . The only Folio compositors yet identified who prefer heere are B, C, and E, and they cannot have set the C* pages. Moreover, what is needed is a compositor who, though he prefers heere , has a high tolerance for here . There thus seems no alternative but to posit yet another Folio compositor, I. About this man's preferences more no doubt could and should be discovered; but there is already enough consistent and significant evidence over a sizable portion of text to make it quite clear that the 'C*' pages in Hamlet and Henry VIII could not have been set by any known Folio compositor. A concordance of suffixes turned up another valuable distinguishing trait for I, one which helps distinguish him not only from A but from every other known Folio compositor. A concordance was first run of the letter combinations nesse , ness , and nes at the end of a word; then these were sorted by hand to remove any words where one spelling or the other would have been misleading or impossible (e.g. 'lionesse', where 'liones' would be ambiguous). The figures for this suffix for all Folio compositors were: -nesse -nes A 243 1j B 815 20 (+34j) C 132 10 (+10j) D 59 2 (+4j) E 163 13 (+2j) F 35 1 (+1j) H 44 1j I 54 20 (+3j) C* ( 1 &amp; 2H4 ) 30 0 I is also unique on a similar test for the suffix variant ie/y . After the computer had run a concordance of the letter combinations -ie and -y at the end of a word, these were sorted by hand to remove all monosyllables, words ending in -ay or -oy, and a few other words like hereby and thereby (where the suffix is equivalent to the monosyllable by ) and obey , grey , and convey (often spelled -ay). The results were: -ie -y A 1014 1920 B 2178 8057 C 503 1056 D 506 498 E 429 1531 F 60 438 H 104 314 I 23 502 C* ( 1 &amp; 2H4 ) 217 404 This test clearly distinguishes between A and B, between D and all other Folio compositors (particularly F), between A and my proposed compositor H in Troilus (A =1/&lt;2, H = 1/+3), and between I and every other Folio compositor. The closest any other compositor comes to I in this respect is F, whose 1-to-7 ratio is not really comparable to I's of 1-to-22. A third suffix test also proved useful in distinguishing I from A, D, H, and B's partner in 1 and 2 Henry IV . This is the triple variant -ies/-yes/-ys. -ies -yes -ys A 205 323 9 B 945 761 36 C 283 127 19 D 141 38 21 E 248 127 1 F 52 31 1 H 29 32 2 I 51 33 1 C* ( 1 &amp; 2H4 ) 40 66 0 Only A and C* actually prefer the -yes spelling; D is unique in his relatively high tolerance of -ys. I is clearly distinct from A (2-to-3 against 5-to-3), and H does not look like A either. The distinction between A and I, and between I and the C* compositor in 1 and 2 Henry IV , is important not only in itself but also because it will affect our attributions of another four pages in 2 Henry IV and Hamlet , which Hinman assigned to A or A*. Hinman himself had grave doubts about the two pages in Hamlet , and though he expressed no such reservations about the 2 Henry IV pages, his identification there was based upon the same negative reasoning: the absence of any traits which would require an attribution to C. In other words, Hinman presumes A's presence, unless there is positive evidence to the contrary. I will return to the 2 Henry IV pages in a moment, but the Hamlet pages, nn6 and nn6 v , can be dealt with immediately. Staid occurs twice in the two pages, at 522 and 435, both in unjustified lines, both representing possible departures from copy (Q2 stayed , stay'd ). A has an absolute preference for stayd ; of the word's nine occurrences in his stints, only one is justified, and one represents a departure from copy ( R2 1285). Compositor I set the word only once elsewhere, but there he spelled it staid , where Q2 has stayd ( Hamlet 988). Similarly, at 538 F has ranck , a spelling which never occurs in A's stints; A spells ranke on each of the 8 occasions he encounters the word, once against copy ( R2 1213). Compositor I met it twice elsewhere, once spelling ranck ( H8 535) and once ranke ( HAM 911). Since the attribution of these two pages to A rests wholly on negative evidence, staid and ranck seem to me sufficient to justify assigning them to I. Certainly, for anyone who believes that the Folio was set from Q2, the evidence for I is compelling; but even without such an assumption, it can rightly be maintained that we have no real reason to suspect A's presence in these quires at all, so that even a single piece of good evidence would be quite sufficient to confirm that these pages, like the rest, should be assigned to I. With Troilus , Henry VIII , and Hamlet behind us, we can now turn to the most problematic of Hinman's C* attributions, those in 1 and 2 Henry IV . Hinman's case against A was based almost entirely on 3 words, or more specifically 3 spellings: Go-too , houre , and heere (I, 374-377; II, 84, 101-103). Go-too , with a hyphen, appears 5 times on χgg1 v ; A never uses the hyphen. As the hyphens do not appear in Q1, we must assume either that A did not set the page or that Q1 for 2H4 was not used as copy (or both). A also prefers goe (189) to go (9, of which 7 are justified). As for houre , on 2 occasions (1 in 1H4 , 1 in 2H4 ) it is substituted for copy howre . Although A will tolerate houre , Hinman thinks it unlikely that A would prefer it to copy howre , which coincides with his own preference. He may be right; but in fact A, as currently defined, does not (quantitatively) prefer howre . He spells howre 17 times (1 justified), 6 representing a departure from copy; he spells houre 34 times (5 justified). In itself the houre can tell us nothing. The real difficulty is created by heere . In quire e ( 1H4 ), B's partner never altered copy heere to here ; on 8 occasions (4 justified), he instead substituted heere for copy here . In quire f, he twice in unjustified lines altered copy heere to here , but 3 times (once unjustified) substituted heere for copy here . In quire g, he substituted here for copy heere only once, in a justified line, making the reverse change 7 times (6 justified). In χgg3 r -4 v , he set heere 10 times, 9 of these being against copy, and 6 of the 9 occurring in un justified lines. In the two plays as a whole, B's partner set heere 33 times (only 17 justified), and here only 50 times. A set here ( s ) 23 times in Richard II , 11 of these against copy. Only once did he spell heere , on which occasion he eye-rhymed it with neere . Throughout his stints he spelt heere only 27 times, 18 of these in justified lines. He spelled here 291 times (only 51 justified). His preference for the short form in unjustified lines is thus 240 to 9, or over 26 to 1. He never, to our knowledge, spelt heere when his copy had here except for the eye-rhyme with neere and once in a justified line in R3 (1675). Consequently the 8 heeres in quire e are extremely irregular, to say the least, particularly because for 1H4 there can be no doubt about the Folio copy. The evidence from quire f would be less disturbing in itself—since it only involves 1 change against preference in a short line, which could be dismissed as a mere fluke—but in the context of the quire e evidence, it is hard to ignore. Likewise, one could claim that 2H4 was not set from Q1, and thereby explain the Folio heeres as due to the influence of scribal copy, but the concentration of these spellings in χgg3 r -4 v —6 in unjustified lines, as compared to 9 in unjustified lines in all A's other stints combined —is extremely difficult to dismiss, particularly in the context of similar anomalies throughout quires e-f. Moreover, 2 further spellings, which were originally used to distinguish F and A, also contradict the assignment to A: mistris , appearing 8 times, as opposed to only 1 occurrence of A's strongly preferred mistresse ( 1H4 2099 (j); Q5 mistris ), and indeede , 12 times in 1 and 2 Henry IV , as opposed to only 2 (justified) occurrences of A's indeed . Several speech prefixes corroborate the doubts about A's presence in 1 and 2 Henry IV . In 2H4 B's partner set Glo 8 times; only 3 of these could be attributed to Q1, which has Hum in the other 5. But Compositor A elsewhere set Glost or Glouc 88 times, as against 20 appearances of the shorter form—and of those 20, 18 are from copy ( R3 ) and the other 2 are in very crowded lines ( 1H6 ). Likewise, B's partner in 2H4 set War 18 times. Unfortunately, all of these agree with Q1, so that the value of this evidence is partly dependent on our hypothesis about the Folio's copy; but if F was not set from Q1, it is certainly significant that A elsewhere preferred the longer form Warw by a margin of 63 to 18. Of those 18 appearances of War , 6 are in long lines, and 13 are concentrated on a single page (q2 v ). B's partner in 1 and 2H4 set West 20 times (19 in 2H4 , all agreeing with Q1), and Westm only twice; A set Westm 8 times (7 in 3H6 , set immediately before and after 1 and 2H4 ) and West 6 times (all in Henry V , set 5 quires earlier). B's partner in 2H4 set Clar 10 times, and Cla twice; only 1 of the shorter forms could be attributed to Q1 copy. Compositor A set Clarence 12 times, Clar 14 (many in crowded verse lines), and Cla never. B's partner set Hostesse 17 times, and Host 30; the longer form in each case expands his copy, but it is nevertheless significant that Compositor A in Henry V never used the shorter form. If these speech prefix preferences were our only evidence for a different compositor, they would not be compelling, but in conjunction with the spelling differences it is difficult to disregard the fact that B's partner in setting these two plays consistently preferred shorter abbreviations for these 5 names than Compositor A did elsewhere, particularly in the plays he set immediately before and after the composition of 1 and 2 Henry IV . If 2 Henry IV was not set from quarto copy, this evidence is even more significant. A 1 &amp; 2H4 (C*) I {heere 9(+18j) 16(+17j) 20(+7j) {here 240(+51j) 37(+13j) 8(+4j) common spp longer shorter {mistris 1(+1j) 5(+2j) 2 {mistresse 17(+6j) 1j 0 {Indeed 23(+6j) 2j 17 {Indeede 7(+5j) 5(+7j) 1 {Deed(s) 38 1j 6 {Deede(s) 3 4(+1j) 0 Unfortunately, I have found no hard psycho-mechanical evidence which would differentiate A and the C* compositor here. In respect to unspaced internal commas, unspaced terminal commas, positioning of exit directions, and flow-over verse lines, the x-case pages in 1 and 2 Henry IV are indistinguishable from A's work elsewhere. But such evidence, though convincing when we can get it, is necessarily confined to a handful of binary options, and it is mathematically inevitable that some Jacobean compositors must have shared all the same psycho-mechanical preferences—especially as some of the alternatives, like terminal spaced commas, are rare. Moreover, in regard to one such psycho-mechanical trait, catchwords, the agreement of A and C* is not so perfect as it might appear: if A did set these C* pages, then e4 of 1 Henry IV is the only time out of 53 opportunities when A set a short catchword. Flukes, of course, do happen; but concatenations of flukes should not. The speech-prefix evidence is midway in reliability between psychomechanical and spelling habits, and it shows a consistent difference between A and C*. Finally, the spelling evidence is more convincing than most such evidence, insofar as for 1 Henry IV we know the spellings of C*'s copy, and we are able to compare these not only with A's overall preferences but also with his reactions when setting from printed copy. Moreover, in the case of here/heere we are dealing with a very common word and a very strong preference, shown in A's setting before and after 1 Henry IV , from both manuscript and printed copy. And although the copy for 2 Henry IV remains disputed, we should not let this unresolved ambiguity blind us to the evidence from the Folio text of that play. In some respects the evidence against A is stronger if the Folio was set from printed copy; in others, it is stronger if printed copy was not used. This means that, however the issue of copy is eventually decided, some of the spelling and speech prefix evidence against A will remain intact. And in respect to heere/here , the simple quantitative count is unmistakably anomalous anyway, regardless of the copy. After the evidence above had been collected manually, the computer turned up a great deal more. (This list is not exhaustive, by any means.) C* ( 1 &amp; 2H4 ) A been 1 (+1j) 28 (+10j) beene 21 57 (+11j) behind 1 12 behinde 5 6 deed 1 28 deede 4 (+1j) 2 (+1j) he 39 (+19j) 689 hee 43 (+87j) 144 Iack 9 1 (+1j) Iacke 17 0 me 179 854 mee 18 17 meet 4 (+1j) 46 meete 8 (+1j) 5 need 3 (+1j) 33 neede 7 (+1j) 13 pluck 1 21 plucke 0 2 (al)ready 2j 21 (al)readie 6 (+4j) 14 speed 3 14 speede 3 4 sweet 4 (+6j) 58 sweete 1 (+4j) 0 ta'ne 4 0 tane 0 1 thin 0 1 thinne 1 (+2j) 0 war 14 (+4j) 14 (+7j) warre 10 (+2j) 54 (+22j) we 17 (+10j) 500 wee 41 (+22j) 37 (+36j) wind 0 7 (+1j) winde 7 (+1j) 12 (+1j) ye 11 28 yee 4 3 Most of these involve a greater preference for redundant final -e, which is especially remarkable for the group hee/mee/wee/yee. (Compositor I, incidentally, agrees with A in preferring the shorter forms—further evidence of the need to split Hinman's C*.) In my opinion, this new evidence makes it impossible to believe that A could have set the x-case pages in either of these plays. It thus seems to me that Hinman's original doubts about A's presence in these two plays were justified, and that another partner for B should be sought. But if so, neither C, D, F, H, nor I will do. The objections against H and I have already been stated. We can accept C's presence only if we postulate the complete abandoning of his distinctive terminal spaced commas, and while there is a considerable gap between C's last appearance (in King John ) and the setting of 1 Henry IV , to presume the loss of such a major trait we would need overwhelming evidence of the appearance of all C's other characteristics; for all intents and purposes, if C changed this habit between King John and 1 Henry IV , then the later C might as well be another man. In fact one of the most outstanding traits of B's partner in 1 Henry IV is his accuracy, whereas C's work with reprints in the Comedies suggests a compositor as careless as Compositor B, and prone to the same types of (memorial) error (O'Connor, 'Qualitative Analysis'). Consequently, even if C and B's partner in 1 Henry IV prove to share every other preference, it seems to me impossible to have any confidence that they are the same man. 20 Compositor D can also be ruled out. C* has an absolute preference for Devil (17); D, an absolute preference for divell (17). C* capitalizes Heaven 10 out of 11 times; D never capitalizes it in 29 occurrences. D has an absolute preference for meete ; the C* stints of 2 Henry IV have meet 3 times (all 3 against copy, if Q was copy). The evidence against F is just as compelling. F has an absolute preference for sweet ; the C* stints of 2 Henry IV have the long form 4 times, once unjustified. Even more convincing, the C* stints on 12 occasions use the contraction -le, 3 of them in unjustified lines; F has an absolute preference for -ll. And D and F, after all, both strongly prefer here —as does H, B's partner in Troilus . To summarize: the C* stints in 1 and 2 Henry IV cannot be assigned to A, C, D, F, or H. Neither can the C* stints in Henry VIII and Hamlet . However, the C* stints in 1 and 2 Henry IV cannot be assigned to the same compositor as those in Henry VIII and Hamlet (I). I therefore propose to identify the C* compositor in quires e-χgg as another new compositor, J. We can now reconsider the pages in this part of the Folio which Hinman assigned to A. A's complete absence from quires e-χgg, involving the whole of 1 and 2 Henry IV , makes his presence in χgg2 and the end of χgg2 v relatively improbable—especially when Hinman's attribution to A rested almost solely on the absence of evidence for C , coupled with the assumption that the Folio was set from Q1, so that the 5 heres on page χgg2 represented departures from copy heere . On the other hand, the 5 here spellings, the fact that the pages involved were the last set from case x before A's return, and that B took over from J for the middle of χgg2 v , do lend plausibility to Hinman's attribution. However, the only evidence for A is the recurrent here , and if Q1 was not the Folio copy, the value of that evidence is severely diminished, because J clearly had a fairly high tolerance for here . Moreover, 5 spellings in the page and part-page Hinman assigned to A argue against his presence: indeede (1954, 1971), deedes (2126), and bloudie (1902, 1908). Compositor A preferred bloody or bloudy (to bloodie or bloudie ) by a margin of 36 (2 justified) to 7, substituting it once for copy -ie; on χgg2—if Q1 was copy, as the attribution to A presumes—both -ie spellings represent alteration of copy, whereas the single -y follows copy. Three of the 5 anomalous spellings, moreover, agree with J's preferences elsewhere. In the only occurrences of these words in unjustified lines in his stints, he spells bloody twice, but both times following copy ( 1H4 1925, 1956); more significantly, he spells deedes once ( 1H4 1966) and indeede three times ( 1H4 2565, 2H4 1545, 2558). In 1 Henry IV , indeede occurs four times against copy; the two indeeds follow copy. Given that the use of Q1 2 Henry IV as copy for the Folio remains conjectural (and in my opinion unlikely), the case for J in the disputed pages seems stronger than that for A. And the presence of hee and wee (13 to 3) confirms J's presence. Though a more extended investigation would no doubt discover further distinguishing traits of H, I, and J, the basic identifications seem to me fairly secure. All three compositors make a single and fairly brief appearance in the Folio, working on a succession of bibliographically related pages from case x in tandem with Compositor B at case y. Each is, I suspect, a journeyman, only occasionally employed by Jaggard. Certainly, the work of all the minor Folio compositors now falls into a fairly coherent pattern, which fits the hypothesis of a succession of journeymen. A, C, D, F, H, I, and J all have their exits and their entrances; B alone abides, to be joined eventually by the apprentice E. Our portrait of Compositor A has shrunk yet again; he is now restricted to work on ten plays. He played no part in the setting of the disputed-copy texts of 2 Henry IV and Hamlet , and none in Troilus and Cressida . None of the texts he set is a simple reprint; the 'normally reliable' compositor that Alice Walker described in Folio 1 Henry IV was not A but another man, who helped set only one other Folio text. Consequently, an editor's expectation of how much and what kind of errors to expect in A's work can only be constructed on an analysis of unanimously-rejected readings in the plays he set from annotated or manuscript copy. As this has not yet been done, A's reputation as a uniquely reliable and trustworthy compositor, whose work editors should be loath to emend, is almost wholly unfounded. 21</field>

      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX II The following charts are intended to provide a simplified graphic summary of some of the more important evidence for the distinctions proposed in this essay. Some kinds of evidence are much more important and reliable than others, and some preferences much stronger than others, but the charts do convey at a glance the patterns discursively described in the necessarily-complex foregoing argument. Statements as to preference are based on computer concordances for all compositors. The number of different preferences distinguishing each compositor from every other can thus be further summarized: H1 vs I : 6 H1 vs J : 7 H1 vs H2: 1 I vs J : 8 I vs H2: 5 J vs H2: 6 (Thus, the best-supported distinction is between J and the compositors in Troilus , Henry VIII , and Hamlet ; the least-supported is that between H1 and H2 in Troilus itself, resting almost entirely on the psychomechanical evidence of spaced medial commas.) (In addition, there is I's uniquely high tolerance for -nes , and uniquely high preference for -y over -ie .) (J uses heere and here 33 and 50 times, respectively; C prefers heere 185 to 78) Again, the best-supported identification, on a purely numerical count, is that of J. But in all five plays the evidence is incompatible with any previously-known compositors; even if, for some reason, the spaced medial comma test should prove unreliable in Troilus , so that H1 and H2 are indeed identical, there can be no doubt that the x-case pages in that play were set by someone other than A, C, D, or F.</field>

Statements of A preferences refer to the stints assigned A by Hinman, as modified by Howard-Hill's identification of F, but excluding all of the stints in the five plays under discussion (including χgg2 and χgg2 v in 2 Henry IV , which Hinman assigned securely to A).

On evidence privately supplied by Howard-Hill, in the computer concordances I have assigned E3a to C, and F1b and F1 v a to D. 4 For Alice Walker's use of compositor identifications in determining the copy for Hamlet , see her Textual Problems of the First Folio (1953), pp. 127-130, and 'The Textual Problem of Hamlet : A Reconsideration', R.E.S. , 2 (1951), esp. pp. 343-344. One of the anomalous spellings she draws attention to is ranck , discussed below. 5 For impressive attacks on Walker's hypothesis, see J. K. Walton, The Quarto Copy for the First Folio of Shakespeare (1971); M. A. Shaaber, 'The Folio Text of 2 Henry IV ', SQ , 6 (1955), 135-144; Harold Jenkins, 'The Relation Between the Second Quarto and the Folio Text of Hamlet ', SB , 7 (1955), 69-83. George Walton Williams, in the most important recent contribution to the subject ('The Text of 2 Henry IV : Facts and Problems', SSt , 9 (1976), 173-182), although he does not specifically discuss Walker's evidence, does conclude that 'none . . . is bibliographically compelling, and the aggregate of all does not convince' (180). Eleanor Prosser also rejects Q1's claims, in her forthcoming Shakespeare's Anonymous Editors . I personally feel that the case for quarto copy in 2 Henry IV and Hamlet is unproven, and that in the near future it is likely to be disproven. In my own compositorial identifications I have taken account of the possibility of Q copy for those plays, but in no instance are my identifications dependent on that hypothesis, nor do they in any way reinforce it. 6 For Hinman's retraction, see The Norton Facsimile: The First Folio of Shakespeare , prepared by Charlton Hinman (1968), p. xviii. 7 'Compositor C of The Shakespeare First Folio' (Ph.D. dissertation, University of Kansas, 1966). 8 'Compositors E and F of the Shakespeare First Folio,' PBSA , 66 (1972), 369-406. For a refutation, see T. H. Howard-Hill, 'Compositors B and E in the Shakespeare First Folio and Some Recent Studies' (privately circulated typescript, 1976). 9 Walker, 'Collateral Substantive Texts', SB , 7 (1955), 56. 10 Walker, Textual Problems , p. 90. Walker also attributes to haste A's acceptance of Q spellings, against his own preferences; but this argument is again circular—especially as A not only accepts uncharacteristic spellings, but actually departs from his copy to insert them. 11 'Compositor B of the Shakespeare First Folio', AEB , 2 (1978), 241-264. 12 For the accuracy of the x-case compositor in 1 Henry IV , see Walker, 'The Folio Text of 1 Henry IV ', SB 6 (1954), 45-59. Of course, A's presence in 1 Henry IV is itself disputed; but, regardless of whether A was either man, the compositor who set Troilus is remarkably less accurate than the one who set 1 Henry IV . 13 This text was suggested to me by Howard-Hill's 'Reassessment of Compositors B and E in the First Folio Tragedies: Introductory Remarks' (Shakespeare Association of America seminar paper, 1977), p. 10. It is sometimes difficult to be sure whether a comma is or is not spaced, but the basic pattern seems fairly clear. 14 I have skipped the letter G in order to avoid potential confusion with the Jaggard compositor which John F. Andrews identified as G in his study of the Pavier Quartos. See Andrews, 'Jaggard's Two Compositors in the Pavier Quartos: Implications for Bibliographical Analysis of the First Folio' (Shakespeare Association of America address, 1973). There seems no likelihood that G, a B-type compositor, will be identified with any of the A-type compositors discussed here. 15 Compositor F never uses an -ie ending for these four words. B's partner in Troilus set -ie against copy -y five times for beauty (1629, 1957, 2023, 3050, 3135), once for heavy (2402), once for pitty (2386), and twice for pretty (1843, 3063). Only two of these spellings occur in justified lines. Unless otherwise indicated, statements as to D or F preferences come from O'Connor, as statements of F and A preferences often derive from Howard-Hill. 16 Kenneth Muir, who is editing Troilus and Cressida in the Oxford English Texts series, kindly lent me his list of unanimously-rejected Folio variants. 17 E.

But in the absence of intermediate or subsequent work by C (or any other compositor), the more traits that alter between appearances the less confidence we can have that two appearances by the same workman, rather than single appearances by separate workmen, are involved. So that, in the absence of evidence of overwhelming agreement in all other traits, or of knowledge of compositorial stints in other Jaggard prints set between King John and 1 Henry IV , we must for all intents and purposes assume the presence of two different workmen. 21 It now rests entirely on Alice Walker's 'Some Editorial Principles (with special reference to Henry V )', SB , 8 (1956), 95-111, a study of unanimously-rejected readings in the Folio text of Henry V. Some of Walker's evidence there was undermined by Hinman's reattributions of some B pages to A, and several of her unanimously-rejected readings have since been justified or accepted. I have prepared, and hope eventually to publish, a complete list and analysis of unanimously rejected readings in all A's stints.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Printing, Proof-reading, and Publishing of Thackeray's Vanity Fair : The First Edition by Peter L. Shillingsburg</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From time to time bookseller's catalogues offer Vanity Fair in parts with more or less extensive descriptive notes and references to Van Duzer's 1919 description of his Thackeray library. 1 Occasionally the descriptions refer to other known copies of the novel for comparison. One such catalogue refers to "the Austin copy" as "the finest copy of ' Vanity Fair ' ever offered at auction in America" and ends its headnote on the current offering as "One of the Two Finest Copies Ever Offered at Auction in This Country." 2 Who owns the finest copy of Vanity Fair is a question likely to interest book collectors more than literary critics. And as long as fineness is determined by references to the condition of the wrappers and the priority of advertisements unconnected with the novel's text, it will remain a question of little importance to the critic. But it is an important question to both collectors and critics, and this for reasons hitherto unknown. The basics are, of course, well-known: the first edition 3 consists of 20 numbers in 19 separate installment parts, each with 32 pages of text, additional leaves of advertisements, and printed yellow paper wrappers. The last installment contains numbers 19 and 20. The first number was published on 1 January 1847 and the final double number was published on 1 July 1848. Following completion of the serial issue, left-over sheets from that issue along with newly reprinted sheets from the same typesetting were used for publication of the novel in one volume. The publisher's accounts record multiple printings of this edition and continuous availability of the novel in parts and book form throughout the 1850's and 60's. This summary of the production of Vanity Fair gives a false impression of simplicity. And whether because as scholars and book collectors we prefer simplicity to facts or because the facts have been too difficult to ascertain, both scholars and book collectors have operated under certain naive assumptions which need dispelling—to wit: the idea that any given physical copy of Vanity Fair whether in parts or volume form might as a whole belong to a single printing (the production process of mid-nineteenth century serialized novels makes this as likely to be untrue as to be true); or the idea that the "printing," "issue," or "state" of the text of a serialized novel can be ascertained by reference to points in the wrappers. Regardless of the literary significance of the variants in Vanity Fair , their existence and distribution have an important bearing on the question of "fineness" or "priority" which till now has been inaccessible to book collectors. But the variants do, also, have literary significance and must attract the critics' notice. There are 210 variant readings between the printings within the first edition of which 150 are substantive, 17 being the addition, deletion, or substitution of passages ranging in length from three to seventy-five words. It would seem of some small importance to the literary critic to know that originally Mr. Jos Sedley in Vauxhall Gardens is referred to as a "fat bacchanalian" but that second thoughts delete that description, 4 or that Miss Crawley had originally signified her intention of dividing her "fortune equally" between Sir Pitt's second son and the family at the rectory, but that later the fortune is described merely as an "inheritance" to be divided without reference to proportion (77.25). And it must be of some interest to the followers of Becky's fortunes that in the original text the reason Colonel Crawley, though governor of Coventry Island, could settle on her only 300 pounds a year (out of an annual income of 3000) was that his revenues went to the "payment of certain debts and the insurance of his life," but that later the reference to life insurance was deleted (579.7-8). Indeed, both the critic and the printing historian stand to benefit as much as the book collector from the effort to determine who owns the finest copy of the first edition of Vanity Fair ; for, though there is probably no satisfactory answer, the attempt at one requires that we focus attention not only on book-collecting values, but on the complex printing history of the book, and the artistic effects of the author's continued interest in the composition of the work during the printing processes. We can determine when those 210 variants first appeared in the text, who was responsible for them, and finally what significance they have to our understanding and assessment of the novel. As David Randall pointed out in his 1948 notes toward a collation of Vanity Fair , there are five areas of concern for parts-issued books: front wrappers, back wrappers, inserted advertisements, plates, and text. 5 For Vanity Fair , by far the greatest interest to date has been lavished on the first three—the parts the author had the least do do with. Booksellers continue to identify their copies of Vanity Fair by reference to readings on the wrappers and by one or two famous "points" in the text which are not in fact points, one of the most often used "points" remaining unchanged throughout all printings of the first edition. 6 But these five concerns are merely the discrete parts of the product. Taken together they are the corporate results of the activities of publishing, printing, binding, and marketing, each of which affects the five-part product. In addition to the books themselves, we can bring to bear information from the publisher's records, the author's letters relative to the production, and our knowledge of how books were made in the midnineteenth century as well. Synthesizing all the evidence makes it possible to provide a satisfactory guide to the effects production history had on the novel, the specific result of production represented by a given copy of the book, and the significance the vicissitudes of production have for the student of the text and for the book collector. Most traditional collectors of Vanity Fair probably think much of this investigation unnecessary. One recently assured me that a useful bibliography is one that identifies the printings in a simple straightforward way for book collectors. But identifying the printing or state represented by any given copy of Vanity Fair is seldom possible. It is often possible to identify the printing or state of each sheet or gathering within a given copy of the book, but most copies of Vanity Fair as wholes represent hybrids or mixtures of sheets from different printings—as a natural result of the methods of manufacturing and marketing the book. 7 When each monthly part was published, a certain number of copies of the part were printed from type. As each stack of printed sheets dwindled in the bindery, it was replenished by reprinting the depleted numbers. The result was that some parts were reprinted more often than others (see Chart I). The book was available in parts for years after it had also become available in book-form, and the book-form itself was bound in small lots ordered as needed for distribution; hence sheets from one printing can appear indiscriminately mixed with sheets from other printings in any given book—regardless of its present form, whether parts or volume. If a particular copy of the book has an early title-page and prefatory material the rest of the book may yet consist of sheets printed late or a mixture of early and late. Even if parts-issue had ceased once the book as a whole became available, one need only be reminded that eighteen months elapsed between the printing of part one and the printing of the title-page, and that, according to the publisher's records, during those eighteen months parts 1 and 7-13 were each reprinted once. 8 Whereas I have been able to identify the order in which readings were introduced to the text and have given the readings in that order in the appended table, they may appear in confusing disorder in any given copy of Vanity Fair . Thus, in using the variants lists as a means of identifying a given book, each gathering must be identified separately. Furthermore, the Vanity Fair owner must be warned that the difference between parts and book-form issues was created by the bindery, not the press. In other words, the mere fact that a copy was issued in parts is no guarantee that the text is an early printing, nor does the fact that a copy is in book-form mean that it is composed of later printed sheets. But enough of complexities. Following the completion of the parts issue on 1 July 1848 and during the succeeding fifteen years, Bradbury and Evans issued the first edition of Vanity Fair continuously in parts and volume forms. Each monthly part was printed at least six times, twelve parts were printed seven times, and two parts were printed eight times—prepared according to the schedule in Chart I. The novel was stitched into parts and bound in book-form for distribution according to the schedule in Chart II. I. The first printing of each number was run off from standing (moveable) type. Positive identification of printings from type can be made by measuring the length of any printed line extending from margin to margin. If the measurement equals or exceeds 3 and frac1316ths inches (9.7 cm), the page was printed from standing type; copies printed from stereotyped plates measure 3 and ¾ths inches (9.6 cm) or less. 9 States of the first printing were created when certain changes were effected in the standing type before stereotyped plates were cast. Though it is not clear whether these changes are stop-press corrections producing two states of the first printing or if they represent second printings from type, the former seems to me the more likely in view of certain evidence to follow concerning stereotyping. The changes in the standing type are listed in columns one through two of Chart III. In one instance, that of signature X in part number 10, three "states" of the "first printing" are distinguishable (see Chart III, 309.3 and 309.11). In the publisher's account books, charges for stereotyping were entered at the same time as those for initial composition and corrections, and it is conceivable, perhaps even probable, that the stereotypes were cast immediately after the first printing from standing type. If that were the case, one would expect to find relatively commonly copies of Vanity Fair in parts with numbers 1 and 7-13 printed from stereotypes since these numbers were reprinted months before re-issue in book-form (see Chart I). In fact, however, both the normal complexities of original production and the rapacity of unscrupulous bookmen have produced copies of Vanity Fair in parts with sheets printed from stereotypes. The worst instance I know of the latter is the Heineman copy in the Pierpont Morgan Library which is expertly repaired so that only careful examination reveals that seven of the gatherings were made up by combining pages from at least two different copies—one printed from type and one from stereotyped plates—and that three additional whole gatherings printed from stereotypes were probably supplied surreptitiously: a classic case of collecting wrappers and advertisements rather than texts. However, not all "mixed copies" are aberrations; the publisher's records show that Vanity Fair was always available in parts so that as the years went by new-sold parts would contain late-printed sheets. Similarly, copies in volume form sometimes contain early, maybe first-printing, sheets either as a normal result of binding schedules or because some purchaser of early parts had his copy rebound in volume form. Nevertheless, certain copies (not all in parts) composed mostly of sheets printed from type have been noted with numbers 1 and 7-11 both printed from stereotyped plates and sharing all the readings characteristic of the last "state" of the printing from type. 10 Not only does this pattern correspond with the publisher's records, but it demonstrates that the major alterations in Vanity Fair , for these numbers at least, were effected after stereotyping. It is likely that similar copies of the book in parts also exist with numbers 12-13 printed from stereotypes but with readings corresponding to the final state of the first printing. It is misleading to speak of a second printing of Vanity Fair , for not all parts reached a second printing at the same time. There was, nevertheless, a short time in which the publisher was producing books with a characteristic combination of first-printing sheets and second-printing sheets which it is tempting to refer to as a second stage of production. 11 II. A. The second printing of numbers 1 and 7-13, apparently issued in combination with first-printing sheets of the rest of the book, is printed from stereotyped plates but shares the readings of the final state of the printing from type (see column three in Chart III). Numbers printed from stereotypes but with readings agreeing with the printing from type can be distinguished from type-printed numbers by the measurement described above (i.e. type-printed pages measure 3 and frac1316ths inches or more horizontally from margin to margin while stereotype-printed pages measure 3 and ¾ths inches or less). This second printing of numbers 1 and 7-13 can sometimes be distinguished from other, later stereotype printings by the readings in column three of Chart III. Though the publisher's records give no clear indication of when the majority of substantive variants were introduced, 12 the existence of numbers 1 and 7-11 printed from stereotypes with unaltered readings proves conclusively that changes in those numbers post-date the stereotyping and suggests a similar pattern for the rest of the book. In addition, the evidence of machine collation, though inconclusive, seems to suggest that in numbers 2, 3, and 5 a few changes not actually noted in any copy of the book printed from type may in fact pre-date stereotyping. 13 It is possible that these changes were made in standing type which was not then used again before stereotypes were cast and that the further changes made after stereotyping were effected before the plates were used the first time. Hence, there may never have been copies of the book with the earlier changes only. The importance of the machine-collation evidence is that it suggests a priority of changes and supports the notion that interest in changing the text was continuous with Thackeray, not merely a one-time or haphazard concern. The changes that appear to pre-date stereotyping are all corrections or alterations of some magnitude and are probably authorial. (See asterisked entries in Chart III.) II. B. The second printing of parts 2-6 and 14-20 was made from stereotyped plates incorporating considerable alterations and seems to have occurred at about the time of the third printing of parts 1 and 7-13. See Chart I for the rapidity of reprinting during the eight months following the serial's conclusion (July 1848 through February 1849). This second printing of parts 2-6 and 14-20 can be distinguished from the first printing by the measurement indicated above (i.e. the first printing is from type, the second from stereotypes) and by the readings listed in Chart III, column three. III. The third printing of parts 1 and 7-13 was made for the most part from corrected stereotyped plates. However, the "correction" of signature Y entailed the removal of a woodcut dropped into the text. The result was that the text from that point to the end of the chapter had to be moved up 9.7 centimeters. Rather than trying to cut and move stereotyped plates, the printers reset the whole of pages 366-340. Thus, the first pages of signature Z are affected in the same way. At least one printing, probably the third, was run off from corrected plates except for pages 336-340 for which type was imposed along with plates. The readings characteristic of this printing are recorded in Chart III, column four. IV. The fourth and later printings by Bradbury and Evans are not distinguishable from one another and are only occasionally identifiable at all. The publisher's records show at least six printings for each part, seven printings for twelve parts and eight printings for two parts. Signatures Y and Z are again significant, for the pages printed from type in the third printing were then stereotyped for subsequent printings and though there are no distinguishing readings, the type-page measurements indicate stereotyping. The title-page, printed with parts 19-20, is the only part that can be distinguished in more than four printings. According to the publisher's records, the final part (containing numbers 19-20, the preface, and title-pages) was printed seven times by Bradbury and Evans before Smith, Elder, and Company acquired the stereotypes and back stock in 1865. The Bradbury and Evans printings occurred three times in 1848, once each in 1849 and 1855, and twice in 1864. Unlike the text, the title-page seems to have been reset for each printing, and six different settings have been identified. Though it is impossible to determine the precise order in which the title pages were prepared, it is beyond question that the first one given in Chart VI is the first printing. It seems likely that the two printings dated 1849 precede some if not all the others dated 1848 because the books they belong to have readings pre-dating readings in copies with the 1848 date. However, as I have taken pains to show, the state of one sheet cannot be used as evidence for the state of other sheets in the same book because mixtures of early and late sheets were a normal product of the bindery. Since each of the title pages was entirely reset, the apparent carry-over of a characteristic from one to the next would be fortuitous, not indicative of order. When Smith, Elder, and Company acquired the copyrights and the back stock of stereotypes and printed sheets from Thackeray's other publishers in July, 1865, they acquired from Bradbury and Evans 5,001 copies of "various numbers" of Vanity Fair in parts and two copies bound up. Over the next eight months they printed enough "various numbers" to bring the total to 17,392 which were made into 865 copies of the book bound in cloth with 92 numbers left over. Though I have not yet encountered a copy dated 1865, a charge for new titles was entered in the account books for November of that year. A copy dated 1866 is at the Simon Fraser University Library, Burnaby, B.C., Canada. 14 The records also show an August 1868 printing of 250 copies, again with a new title page dated 1868; there is a copy (not personally examined) in the British Library. It is curious that Smith, Elder reprinted the first edition of Vanity Fair in 1868, for that is the year they brought out an entirely new edition of the book as part of a collected edition of Thackeray's works. What does it all mean? For the book-collector, I hope the historical record reveals the true nature of the copies of Vanity Fair he owns, and that it establishes a range of representative copies he may seek to add to his collection. For the historian of printing, I hope the record with its combination of evidence from publisher's records and the books themselves confirms his sense of the complexity of the economic, technological, and artistic confluence that commercial book publishing was. For the textual editor the implications are patently clear. For the literary critic and student of Thackeray's works, I hope the record of variants provides a basis for further understanding Thackeray's attitude towards his text and supplies evidence leading to a clearer understanding of his concerns in the novel. Some changes seem to have relatively obvious motives: the elimination of Dobbin's lisp (all but one instance) at 50.18 and 105.18-19 is clearly intended to improve the image of the book's only gentleman. And the deleted reference to life insurance at 579.7-8 is the mere correction of an error, since at 501.3-4 Rawdon was unable to qualify for life insurance at all. But other changes suggest more subtle motives. Why, for example, did Thackeray find it inappropriate, at 50.11up, to call Jos a "fat bacchanalian"? And why, at 75.29, does he change Lady Muttondown to Lady Southdown and then decide, at 500.35, that it is also inappropriate to refer to Lady Southdown as Lady Macbeth? Why, at 40.10-11, is the sentence "And what can Alderman Dobbin have amongst fourteen?" (so reminiscent of St. John's account of the feeding of the five thousand) deleted? And why is Mrs. Blenkinsop, at 55.14-15, no longer allowed to opine to Pinner, apropos of Becky, that governesses are "neither one thing nor t'other." If nothing else, the alterations focus attention on passages that were, somehow, not right and for which the new readings are, somehow, better. But this article is not the place for critical speculation or evaluation; I only hope that this presentation of the evidence of revision will stimulate critical assessments providing a clearer understanding of Thackeray's achievement in Vanity Fair . 15</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chart I— Vanity Fair Printing Schedule Basically there were six printings of Vanity Fair : The original printing, 1 January 1847 through 1 July 1848; a second comprehensive printing in July, 1848; a third in September, 1848; a fourth in February, 1849; the fifth was scattered out over the years 1854 to 1857; and the sixth was scattered through 1861 to 1864. In addition numbers 1, 3, and 7-13 were printed an extra time in 1847-48, and numbers 2-4, 7, and 19-20 were printed an extra time in 1864-65. Thus, numbers 3 and 7 were printed eight times; numbers 1, 2, 4, 8-13 and 19-20 were printed seven times; the rest only six.

      <field name="fulltext">Chart II— Vanity Fair Schedule of Disbursement There are various ways to read the publisher's records to gain an idea of the rate at which books left the publisher for the public—none produce the same result. All the records account for the book by parts so that a single bound book is treated as 20 parts. There are records of payments made for stitching copies (no telling if for parts or book issue), but apparently some copies were sold unstitched. There are half-yearly summary reports of numbers sold (no telling whether as parts or book-form), but these figures were determined, apparently, by subtracting the numbers currently in hand, presented, given to the author, etc., from the number in hand at the beginning of the six month period plus any new printings; hence, the number "sold" seldom if ever equals a number divisible by 20 parts, which if that were the case might indicate all sales were of whole books. So it is not clear whether the number recorded as sold accurately reflects the sale of partial runs in parts or simply approximates the numbers sold in book-form. Finally there are six-month records of the form of copies remaining in hand: so many parts in quires, so many stitched, so many in cloth binding, and so many "P.O." (a label I do not understand identifying figures which sometimes are divisible by 20, sometimes not and ranging from 3 to 242). The following chart provides half-yearly summaries of the records of disbursement and analysis of stock in hand in parts in order to demonstrate the ways any bound copy of the book might combine sheets from separate printings as a normal product of the manufacturing process—making it, incidentally, solecistic to speak of the "impression" or "state" of a given copy of Vanity Fair as a whole. The usually discrete production stages of book publishing (printing, binding, selling) intermingle in serial publication to produce bewildering combinations.

      <field name="fulltext">Chart III—Variants Within the First Edition of Vanity Fair This chart provides a means of identifying the printing and sometimes the state within a printing of individual sheets in Vanity Fair . The variants are grouped under part numbers and, within parts, under signatures. The first two columns represent the first and second states of the first printing of each sheet (a third state of signatures X and FF is distinguishable as indicated in notes under these signatures in the chart). Columns three and four represent the second and third printings of each sheet. A fourth printing is distinguishable for signatures C, L, R, Y, Z, and QQ (as indicated in notes under each of these signatures in the chart). The second printing is always distinguishable from the first, even when no variants occur (as in signature B), because it was printed from stereotyped plates. When the illustration in signature Y (336.2-3) was removed, text was reset and moved up to fill the gap—moving in the process some text from Z to Y, hence the jagged delimiter between these signatures in the chart. The third and fourth printings of signatures Y and Z are distinguishable even though there are no variants because pages 336-340, newly reset for the third printing, were printed from type whereas in the fourth printing plates were used. When a reading remains unchanged from one state or printing to the next, it is represented in the next column by a dash. When for a given signature a printing is identifiable only by a change from type to stereotype as a means of printing, the column will contain no changed readings but will be represented by dashes. If the state or printing represented by a column is not distinguishable in any way for a given signature, the column is left blank. For example, for signature B, only one state of the first printing can be distinguished, hence column two is blank; on the other hand, though no variants were introduced in the second printing, made from stereotyped plates, the second-printing column is represented by dashes. Anyone discovering a copy of a signature in the book which contains changes in a pattern not fully represented by any one column (or its attending notes) will have discovered a hitherto unknown printing or state for that signature. Entries marked by an asterisk (*) record changes which machine collation suggests may have been made in the type before stereotyping; however, no copy of the book printed from type with altered readings has been seen confirming the priority of asterisked readings (see text footnote 13).

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Henry S. Van Duzer, A Thackeray Library (1919; rpt. 1965), pp. 123-132. 2 Proofs from an unknown auction catalogue in the Lilly Library, Indiana University. 3 By "first edition" I mean, of course, all printings of Vanity Fair using the type set for the book as it appeared in parts from 1 January 1847 through 1 July 1848. (See Fredson Bowers, Principles of Bibliographical Description [1949], pp. 379ff.) Some collectors use the term to mean only the "first printing," as seems to be the case in David A. Randall's "Notes Towards a Correct Collation of the First Edition of Vanity Fair ," PBSA , 42 (1948), 95-109. 4 W. M. Thackeray, Vanity Fair (London: Bradbury and Evans, 1848) p. 50, line 11 up. Further references to Vanity Fair are made in the text within parentheses giving page and, if appropriate, line number in the form (77.25), i.e. page 77, line 25. 5 Randall, p. 96. 6 Mr. Pitt (453.31), which was not changed to Sir Pitt until the second edition (London, 1853), seems to be a favorite point, perhaps because its presence in every copy of the first edition makes every owner happy. Other "points" such as the use of roman type for the heading on page 1 and the absence of the Steyne illustration on page 336 first occurred in the third printing of the numbers containing them. 7 The terms "sheet," "signature," and "gathering" all refer to the same basic unit of the book produced at the printing press. In Vanity Fair , first edition, each gathering consists of sixteen pages (eight leaves) and is signed at the foot of the first and third pages. 8 Publishers' records are used by permission of Bradbury, Agnew, Ltd., London. 9 Stereotyping with plaster-of-Paris produces a slightly smaller type-page due to shrinkage of the plaster mold. For further details see P. L. Shillingsburg, "Detecting Stereotype Plate Usage in Mid-Nineteenth Century Books," Editorial Quarterly , 1 (1975), 2-3. 10 In the Berg Collection, New York Public Library, copy 5 in parts (part 1 only), and copy 1 in bound form (formerly belonging to Charles Dickens—numbers 1, 7-8, and 10-11), and the one copy in the Mitchell Memorial Library, Mississippi State University (numbers 1, and 7-11). 11 See the similar circumstance noted in P. L. Shillingsburg, "The First Edition of Thackeray's Pendennis ," PBSA , 66 (1972), 35-49, esp. pp. 36-42. 12 The records do show that "correction and alteration" of numbers 19-20 cost £3.10.00 on 15 July 1848; that unspecified plate "repair" cost £1.10.00 on 24 February 1849; and that unspecified "mending" of plates cost 15 shillings on 28 February 1857. These charges probably refer to stereotyped plates of text rather than the steel engraved plates of full-page illustrations, for in a separate record of reprints there are standard charges for "bringing up plates and cuts." But it seems unlikely that the record of plate alteration is complete or that the cost of altering stereotyped plates totalled only five or six pounds, particularly when original corrections and night work on parts 19-20 alone came to £11.6.00. 13 When an alteration in standing type involves the substitution of only one character for another the effect on the rest of the line is usually too small to be noticeable even under careful examination, but larger changes, particularly if the total number of characters in the line is affected, cause alterations in the arrangement of words contiguous to the change which are readily seen in a collating machine. Often the corrector changes the spacing of contiguous words to achieve an even balance of spacing along the line. When similar alterations are made in stereotyped plates, such aesthetic considerations are a luxury generally out of reach. The line (indeed the page) is a solid piece of metal which cannot be moved and pushed about; the new reading replaces the old reading and contiguous words remain frozen in place. If the resulting disproportionate spacing is too obvious, the whole line or perhaps two or three lines are reset, the original plate being cut away to make way for the new material. Most of the alterations in numbers 2-6 and 14-20 of Vanity Fair have an appearance compatible with the effects of changes in plates. Those that do not (confined to numbers 2, 3, and 5) are discussed further in the text and identified with an asterisk in Chart III. 14 It appears to have been usual practice with publishers then, as now, to post-date works published late in the year; so the Simon Fraser copy probably belongs to the November 1865 printing. I have not actually seen that book which is non-circulating. 15 My own attempt to provide a critical assessment of the evidence will appear in a special Thackeray issue of Studies in the Novel in 1981.

      <field name="heading_text">The Publication of Tennyson's "Lucretius" by Edgar F. Shannon, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tennyson's "Lucretius," first published in Macmillan's Magazine for May, 1868, was scheduled for simultaneous publication in the United States in the May number of the Atlantic Monthly ; but the poem appeared on May 2 in Every Saturday , a weekly journal owned by Ticknor and Fields (the proprietors of the Atlantic and Tennyson's American publishers), because the page proofs from England providing the text did not arrive in time. This eventuality was only one of the impediments to publication that arose, and from the beginning a question hovered over the arrangements as to whether or not some of the erotic details of Lucretius' monologue would exceed the limits of contemporary public taste. The full description of an Oread pursued by a satyr, which appeared in America but not in Macmillan's and which Tennyson restored when he included the poem a year and a half later in The Holy Grail and Other Poems , has become celebrated in this regard. Professor William D. Paden, using a manuscript which is now in the library of Yale University, has written valuably concerning variations in several texts of "Lucretius"; and Professor Christopher Ricks, through reference to a set of page proof for Macmillan's Magazine and a previously unpublished letter from the poet to Alexander Macmillan, both owned by Mr. W. S. G. Macmillan, has shed further light on the evolution of the poem. 1 Mr. Simon Nowell-Smith later published two additional letters relating to "Lucretius" from Tennyson to George Grove, the editor of Macmillan's Magazine , and reproduced in facsimile the letter that Ricks printed. 2 Fortunately, a number of other documents pertinent to the poem are extant and presently available to scholars: letters from Macmillan and Grove in the archives of the publishing firm in the British Library, several letters by Tennyson and his wife in libraries in England and America, early drafts of passages of the poem at Harvard University, the poet's complete autograph manuscript at Trinity College, Cambridge, a galley proof in the Tennyson Research Centre at Lincoln, and five sets of page proof for Macmillan's in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library. 3 These make it possible to place the materials already published in context, to give an account of the circumstances leading to the publication of the poem and of its critical reception, and to provide a record of the alterations in the manuscripts and a historical collation of the various stages of the text. Such an enterprise not only will clarify the textual development but will supply significant insights into the poet's personality and method of composition and into the human relationships among author, publisher, editor, and wife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I On October 6, 1865, Tennyson, as his wife records, had begun composing "his new poem of 'Lucretius.'" 4 By the end of 1867, he had brought it close to its final form—the first major work that he had completed in the three and a half years since the publication of the Enoch Arden volume in July, 1864. Throughout his literary career he had always been chary of publishing in annuals and periodicals, and he usually did so only after being importuned. In the first part of 1868, however, "feeling uneasy," according to Sir Charles Tennyson, "at his long lack of contact with the public, and not yet ready with enough poems for a new volume," he published (against his wife's judgment), besides "Lucretius," four poems in journals—"The Victim" in Good Words (January), "On a Spiteful Letter" in Once a Week (January), "Wages" in Macmillan's (February), and "1865-1866" in Good Words (March). 5 The immediate prospect of building a house in Surrey, near Haslemere, as a summer retreat from Farringford, may also have made additional income appealing; and the periodicals paid him handsomely. 6 There can be no doubt of the urging of publishers and editors. Grove, who for some years had been on cordial terms with the Tennysons, 7 had apparently in the latter part of 1867 solicited a poem from the Laureate and was piqued that Alexander Strahan and the Reverend Norman Macleod, the publisher and the editor respectively of Good Words , had successfully anticipated him, for on December 23 he informed Macmillan, I have got a little poem from A. T.—at last M rs . Tennyson sent it today for the January N o . with an injunction that if too late I was to send it back and I should have it again—This of course I have done. 2 verses very pretty and strong. a sort of pendant to the Will . ("O well for him") ["Wages"] It came very nicely and gratefully on my disappointment about Good Words (Add. MSS. 54793, fols. 17-17 v ). 8 Macmillan replied the next day, "I am so glad about Tennyson. But for any sake secure them for February" (Add. MSS. 55387(2), fol. 804). An advertisement of the January number of Good Words spurred Grove to write again on Saturday, December 28, "A. T. is making himself very common: I notice a poem announced by him for Good Words. We will talk about it on Monday and see if it will be worth while for me to run down to Farringford" (Add. MSS. 54793, fol. 19). They decided that he should go, and from his residence in Lower Sydenham, he notified Macmillan on January 1, 1868, "The Tennysons will be very glad to have me . . . ." He would have set out for the Isle of Wight that morning; but the day was bitter cold, and he was "pinned—fairly floored" with lumbago (Add. MSS. 54793, fol. 23). He contrived to reach Farringford the next day, on Thursday, January 2, stayed over Friday, and returned on Saturday with Tennyson's commitment not only for "Wages" but for "Lucretius." A letter to his brother-in-law, George Granville Bradley, expresses his satisfaction: A. T. was very charming. . . . He has been pleased to promise me Lucretius for Macmillan . The subject is not pleasant, but it is a grand poem; one of the grandest of all his works . . . . Also I hope that you will see in our February number a poem by him called Wages , more characteristic and more lofty (though shorter) than either of those in Good Words or Once a Week (Graves, Grove , pp. 155-156 [Jan. 8, 1868]). Macmillan wrote Tennyson promptly and cordially on Monday, January 6, confirming Grove's arrangements: It is a great pleasure to me to learn from Grove that you are going to give us that great poem about Lucretius of which I have heard rumours so long, and also the little poem Wages which Grove, a good judge thinks so highly of. I gladly assent to the terms you and he arranged: namely £50 for the shorter &amp; £300 for the longer. Whether anything can be arranged to stop the piracy of the papers. I do not know whether it will be possible to hinder the little one. But I will try the big one. Can I arrange with Ticknor and Fields about the Lucretius? I have no sort of objection to your getting as much as you can from them, provided they dont anticipate us (Add. MSS. 55387(2), fol. 848). 9 Tennyson, recognizing that the style and subject matter of "Lucretius" might be too unconventional for the proprietor of a leading magazine to accept, replied on Wednesday, in a previously unpublished letter, now in the library of Yale University: Farringford, Freshwater, Isle of Wight. Jany 8 lh 1868 My dear M r Macmillan Many thanks for yours perhaps I may be able to add another little poem to "Wages"—can't say: but I leave you free to reject Lucr. after you have seen it if you don't like it Ever yours in great haste A Tennyson On January 11, Macmillan gratefully acknowledged receipt of the manuscript of "Wages" and commended its "very noble and true idea fitly expressed," though he ventured to wish that another stanza "could have been added" and, in the second line of the poem, preferred the first reading to its emended wording ("Paid with a voice flying by to be lost in an endless sea"). The expression "flying by" struck his ear as "too light a sound in the middle of a line" (Add. MSS. 55387(2), fol. 875). 10 On the same date, declaring that the poem "really is very fine," he passed the MS to Grove, who responded the next day, ". . . there is enough in these 10 lines for a whole No. . . . I have sent the Poem to Clay [Richard Clay, Macmillan's printer] . . ." (Add. MSS. 55387(2), fol. 875, and 54793, fols. 40-40 v ). By Tuesday, January 14, Macmillan or Grove had received a subsequent letter from the poet containing the additional short poem that he had mentioned previously but also conveying the ominous likelihood that he could not let them have "Lucretius." This undated letter (presumably written on January 12 or 13), now in the Tennyson Research Centre, Lincoln, and here first published, reads as follows: My dear Grove, or Macmillan ___________________ God spake out of the skies To a good man &amp; a wise, "The world &amp; all within it Will only last a minute." Then a beggar began to cry "I must eat, or I must die" "Is it worth his while to eat, Or mine to give him meat?" And the world &amp; all within it Were nothing the next minute. ___________________ This is the first poem which if you like it you may put in before "Wages" Of course I want nothing more in the way of money. But with respect to the Lucretius I am staggered by what I hear from good authority. That if I publish in a serial I virtually give up my copyright &amp; any one has a right to republish me. Really if this be so I must decline giving it to your Magazine however unwillingly Believe me, respected friends, Your's ever A Tennyson If you prefer the first reading in Wages pray ['you' deleted ] keep it. 11 Macmillan consulted his lawyer, John Hopgood, forthwith and assured Grove on January 14 of the solicitor's having no doubt that we have a perfect right to prevent the Journals from copying the poem entire, and I will do it. In the meantime he will look into the legal question carefully and if needful get counsels opinion. I shall have his written opinion tomorrow. It is only a bad custom, in no sense a right that has led to this sort of elaborate plundery (Add. MSS. 55387(2), fol. 884). The publisher was evidently so confident of allaying Tennyson's fears that he promised in a letter to James T. Fields on the same date, "Lucretius you shall have in good time" (Add. MSS. 55387(2), fol. 889); and on January 17, he informed Grove, "I sent off the Büchner to Tennyson last night. I hope you got Hopgoods written opinion which you might forward to Tennyson. I can't see the least difficulty in arranging matters so as to prevent the annoyance he anticipates" (Add. MSS. 55387(2), fol. 900). 12 An undated letter, written within the following week, indicates that Macmillan's and Grove's efforts had gone far toward eliminating the poet's reservations and that his wife was copying the MS for the press: Farringford, Freshwater, Isle of Wight. [January 17-23] 13 My dear Grove The lawyer's opinion has not arrived but if it can be depended on there would seem no good reason why Lucretius should not appear in Macm: In that case (I send you Ticknor &amp; Fields letter) perhaps it would be as well not to let it appear before April, as that would accommodate the American publishers. Then it should be printed first &amp; sent to me to correct, &amp; afterwards dispatched to Boston. The firm has been immensely liberal to Dickens giving him £2000 for some slight essays in their publications &amp; I suppose they would also give me something. The passage in that foolish book of Büchners (&amp; we have looked all over the book to find it) wouldnt do as a motto— Yours always A Tennyson/. I think "flying by" is the best reading: fame goes clanging overhead—like a great bird—fainter and fainter, till the cry dies away. My wife is copying Lucretius as there is only one MSS it is thought better not to trust that to the post./ There are a few slight errors in the copy— she says she does not think it will shock people. Although there is no record in Tennyson's letter diary or in Emily Tennyson's journal, from a letter of January 18, Grove to Macmillan, the Laureate seems to have been at Grove's house on the afternoon of that date; and Grove added in a postscript, "hand a copy of Hopgoods letter to T. tonight" (Add. MSS. 54793, fol. 26). If Macmillan was able to do so, Tennyson should finally have been reassured, but the correspondence between publisher and editor indicates that after this date they were still awaiting a final clearance for "Lucretius" from the poet (Add. MSS. 55387(2), fol. 927). On Friday, January 24, Grove had in hand the MS that Emily had transcribed and, not wishing to delay further, reported to Macmillan, "No news from A. T. yet I shall send the MS. to the Printer on Monday" (Add. MSS. 54793, fol. 45 v ). By Monday, however, Grove had received a letter from the poet's wife, and there was a new complication—Tennyson might wish to publish "Lucretius" in a volume of poems before the agreed-upon twelve months subsequent to its appearance in Macmillan's were out. Grove that day brought this letter personally to Macmillan, who at once wrote graciously to Mrs. Tennyson, saying that he would "not feel it any grievance" if the poem came out in a volume "two or even three months short of the year." He also told her that he and Grove had decided to hold "Lucretius" back until the May issue of the magazine, though "the temptation to let the world have that noble poem is very great. How grand it is!" Now that the February issue of Macmillan's was ready to appear, he enclosed a check for "Wages," which, he added, "we all like exceedingly" (Add. MSS. 55387(2), fol. 950). With what seemed to be the final impediment removed, Grove, on Tuesday, committed the MS to the printer with the following instructions written on the covering leaf: Take great care of this MS. | Set it up in Slip and ['send' deleted ] pull one | proof only —which send with the | MS. to M r . Grove—Lower Sydenham. | Size of type to be that of the ordinary | articles. Jny 28/68 14 Clay's compositors worked swiftly, and it is reasonable to assume that the printer returned the MS and the galley proof which Grove had ordered no later than Thursday. Certainly by the week end (as subsequent letters from Grove and Macmillan, February 2 and 3, verify) the poem was in type, and the MS was again in Grove's possession. Whether or not he sent the galley proof to Tennyson, or whether, if he did, it reached the poet before he left Farringford on Friday, January 31, for Haslemere, to fix the site of Aldworth, his new house, cannot be determined ( Memoir , II, 52). In any case, the very day that Grove dispatched the MS to Clay, he turned his attention to the best way to announce the poem's forthcoming publication—so as to build anticipation and sales—and proposed to Macmillan that they seek to get a notice into the Athenaeum or the Pall Mall Gazette . Enclosing a draft to that purpose, he invited the publisher's revisions (Add. MSS. 54793, fols. 42-42 v ). Macmillan preferred The Times as the appropriate vehicle, and Grove agreed on Thursday, January 30, to try to place the announcement through George Webbe Dasent, the assistant editor. In the same letter, however, he shared the disquieting information that Tennyson's friend and editorial collaborator in The Golden Treasury (1861), Francis Turner Palgrave, "thoroughly" disapproved "of Lucretius being published in a Magazine I hope to G—he wont ['put h' deleted ] unsettle Tennysons mind. He's quite capable of it—" (Add. MSS. 54793, fol. 28). 15 Having acted vigorously by writing Palgrave to forestall this latest threat, Macmillan responded the following day, "I hope what I have said may keep him from troubling Tennyson. Payne is trouble enough" (Add. MSS. 55387(2), fol. 968). 16 By Saturday he could enclose Palgrave's response and say, "I think he will not do any harm now" (Add. MSS. 55387(2), fol. 974). Then on Sunday, just as all looked propitious, the blow fell. Tennyson arrived in Town; and when Grove had a long talk with him, he was determined not to publish. The editor wrote Macmillan that night in great annoyance: He WILL not let us have the Lucretius—Strahan's plaeads and Dallas's advertizments, added to Payne's and E. Lushingtons dissuasions have frightened him. I saw him today &amp; found his mind fully made up . He is going to stop with Knowles till Wednesday morning, then to Woolner's—He said he would call on you. I have the MS. still in my possession. He said that he was quite ready to return the £50 [for "Wages"]. I confess to being very much vext, but I fear he is immoveable . . . (Add. MSS. 55793, fols. 44-44 v ). 17 Macmillan was not a man to surrender his prize easily. Upon receiving Grove's message on Monday, February 3, he wrote immediately to Lushington in Edinburgh as follows: . . . . . . . . . . I am taking the opportunity of asking your kind countenance in a small personal matter. Mr Tennyson, as you remember gave us Sea Dreams for our Magazine, and more recently he has given us a short poem and promised a longer one— Lucretius . Indeed we actually have it in type. He now wishes to recal it; two motives chiefly operate with him as I understand: one, that other magazine publishers have dragged his name into vulgar publicity, the other that you disapprove of it. Now whatever other publishers have done, we have not been guilty in this respect, our advertisements have been unostentatious, not sensational. I think I might persuade him on this point to be content that we should have what he is *for a new issue [ interlined ] 18 expecting in this to give us, and indeed has given us. But no objection stands in my opinion sufficiently weighty to warrant his withdrawal from this arrangement. Now I promise that there will be no vulgar advertisements, and remind you that our Magazine is in no sense a sensational magazine &amp; never has been. I have heard rumours of business consideration. But Mr Tennyson knows that if I really thought it would hurt his interests I would not have accepted it. We are in a very awkward fix, if this really is withdrawn. You probably know that Mr Grove has just taken the Editorship; he has naturally been asking his friends what he had done, and they ask for it was he who obtained the poems. This withdrawal makes him look rather foolish. I am quite sure that neither he nor I would urge it for a moment did we feel that it could possibly hurt Mr Tennyson either in purse or in reputation. But the appearance of this poem in a Scholarly magazine like ours would I am sure in no way do him injury. Forgive my putting this so pointedly to you. But I thought I might venture so far. I would prefer your acting or not acting on what I say without telling Mr Tennyson about it. But of course I have no serious objection, if you think it right to let him know that I have written you. believe me dear Sir very respectfully yours A. Macmillan. (Add. MSS. 55387(2), fol. 978) Lushington's prompt answer regrettably does not appear in the Macmillan archives, but its tenor can easily be guessed from the publisher's reply dated February 6: I must thank you for your very kind letter, and also say that I did not ever suspect you of any unfriendly feeling towards us. Also that I very much sympathise in your objection to Mr Tennyson publishing in Magazines, and shall never urge or ask him to write another thing for us—and indeed I never did myself as he knows. What I meant to say was that we relying on his kind promise, had taken steps that would make his withdrawal extremely awkward for us, and I believe you did not feel the objection so strong as to call for such a step. I ventured to say also that the general tone &amp; character of our magazine, made it more appropriately appear there than in others. Pardon my again troubling you, but I don't want you to misunderstand my feeling. believe me yours very respectfully Alex. Macmillan. (Add. MSS. 55387(2), fol. 992) With Lushington's opposition removed, Macmillan was able to mollify Tennyson. Since the poet remained in London until Sunday, February 9, before going on to Cambridge (Emily Tennyson's MS journal, Tennyson Research Centre), the publisher doubtless did so face to face, and by using much the same arguments and assurances that had placated Lushington. With publication of the poem finally certain, attention can now be turned to the textual development revealed in the MSS and the proofs and to subsequent correspondence pertaining to the latter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II "Lucretius" survives first in a notebook at Harvard in nine autograph fragments, totalling 138 lines (some incomplete), that I have designated MS 1 . These passages, which correspond to 159 lines of the final text, are not in numerical sequence; and one of them that refers to the satyr who chases the Oread and to Lucretius' canvassing of reasons for suicide (203-235) is a second and more advanced version of an earlier draft devoted to the same subject matter. 19 The poet's autograph MS in a notebook at Trinity College, Cambridge (MS 2 ), is the earliest surviving complete draft of the poem and lacks only two lines of the final text (65, 260), which were added in page proof. For the most part a fair copy that reveals notable improvement over the passages of MS 1 , this MS has forty-five emendations, five of them of a line or more in length; and two of them are major insertions of four and a half and four lines respectively (173-177, 213-216). Comparison of this MS with that in Emily Tennyson's hand at Yale (MS 3 ) clearly establishes that MS 2 is the text from which she copied for the press. In doing so, excepting punctuation, she made fifteen mistakes, ten of which Tennyson corrected or emended, 20 but he failed to detect five instances of miscopying—"cans't" for "can'st" (90), "floating" for "fleeting" (161), "Nymphs and Fauns" for "Nymph and Faun" (187), "slipping" for "slippery" (180), and "Who" for "who" (191)—all of which he rectified later in various stages of proof. In addition, the poet made four substantive changes in MS 3 . He inserted the first "he" (132) to provide a syllable necessary to the meter, substituted "an eye" for "a sight" (137) to clarify meaning, altered "with" to "against" (197) to avoid ambiguity ("butted" in opposition to not alongside or in the company of ); and by deleting "Careless" and adding a second "to you" (208), he revised the line from "Careless, I know you careless, yet to you" to read "I know you careless, yet to you, to you", thus shifting the repetition to cause Lucretius to emphasize the illogic, from the point of view of his philosophy, of calling to the gods instead of having him reiterate their detached attitude toward men. 21 The development of the text through MSS 1 and 2 evinces this same scrupulous concern for meter, accuracy of diction, clarification of unintentional ambiguity, and subtlety of emphasis. Moreover, these MSS show Tennyson's care to elevate tone and to dignify language, to move in description from the general to the specific, and to increase the aptness and force of verbs, which have so much to do with the powerful impact of the poem. As an illustration of the first of these aspects of his practice, in MS 2 Lucretius refers to Venus as the goddess whom Paris "Pronounced the prettiest" (92)—words which Tennyson struck out and replaced with "Decided fairest". Fairness for prettiness heightened the language and the quality of Venus' beauty. "Decided" conveyed a considered judgment in place of a mere pronouncement, and a clumsy alliteration disappeared as well. From the generic and plain "brakes and bushes" (205), which in MS 1 Lucretius asks to hide the satyr and the Oread, Tennyson moved in MS 2 and thereafter to "million-myrtled wilderness | And cavern-shadowing laurels" (205-206). By so doing, he detailed the scene, precisely named the predominant shrubs, and through balancing the compound verbal adjectives modifying "wilderness" and "laurels", achieved both weight and motion, which the line at first had lacked. Line 186 instances the poet's attention to the vigor and appropriateness of his verbs. Originally in MS 2 a riot of nymphs and fauns simply " Stirs [ my italics ] all the summit of the copse . . ."; as perfected, the riot " Strikes thro' the wood— sets all the tops quivering". Further, the first two MSS corroborate the poet's propensity, notable in the Trinity MS of the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington , for building a poem through added lines and skillful elaboration. 22 For example, the earliest draft in MS 1 of the section beginning ". . . Catch her, goatfoot" and ending "What Roman would be dragged in triumph thus" (203-234) consisted of only ten lines. The second draft in MS 1 had been expanded to twenty-two, and the third, in MS 2 , to twenty-eight, which in that MS were increased by an insertion to thirty-two—the number in the final text. Emendations within the inserted four lines in MS 2 (213-216) also illuminate his constant sensitivity to the nuances of expression: No larger feast than under plane or pine With neighbours laid along the grass to drink Only s*uch cups [ above undeleted 'o much'] as *left [ above undeleted 'made'] us friendly-warm *Affirming [ below deleted 'Defending'] each his own philosophy— The concrete detail (as well as the metonymy) of "such cups" instead of "so much" and the moderation conveyed by the aftereffects of the wine ("left us"), as distinguished from the causal process of drinking it ("made us"), are distinct improvements. "Affirming" removes the suggestion of disputatiousness in "Defending" and dispenses with the undesirable possibility of a reader's connecting the warmth of "friendly-warm" as much with argument as with wine. Having introduced the wine-drinking, Tennyson then in the succeeding two lines (217-218) transposed the adjectives "sober" and "settled", so that "sober majesties" provide the immediate commentary on the scene in the first line and "settled" recedes to the second, where it joins "sweet" to become appropriately a dual modifier of "Epicurean". From MS 2 onward the passage describing the Oread (188-193) engaged the poet's attention, and one cannot deny that the comparison introducing her in the earliest version is weak: And here an Oread lovelier than the rest Flies on before them. How the Sun delights To glance &amp; shift about her slippery sides, And rosy knees, &amp; supple roundedness, And budded bosom-peaks—A Satyr—see— Follows . . . . By deletion and interlineation in MS 2 Tennyson recast the lines in this manner: And here an Oread—how the Sun delights To glance about her slippery sides, And rosy knees, &amp; supple roundedness, And budded bosom-peaks who this way runs Before the rest—A Satyr,—A Satyr—see— Follows . . . . These examples are sufficient to illustrate Tennyson's craftsmanship; and while it is tempting to pursue the implications and significance of numerous other variants in the MSS, it is necessary to proceed with an examination of the proofs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Whether or not the galley proof in the Tennyson Research Centre (P 1 ) is the single proof that Grove ordered Clay to pull, one cannot say; but it is the earliest surviving printed text of the poem and was set directly from MS 3 . There are eight compositor's errors. Four—"toils" for "tales" (130), "want" for "wont" (209), "Fanishing" for "Vanishing" (257), and "fairy's" for "Fury's" (261)—the poet corrected; four others—"proæmion" for "proœmion" (70), "hand" for "hands" (220), "backwards" for "backward" (221), "O Thou" for "for O Thou" (264)—went unmarked. The accidentals (if one disregards and's in the proof for ampersands in MS, as I do throughout) show some thirty-seven variants in this proof from MS 3 . The compositor cannot always have been certain about Emily's orthography and intention concerning commas, periods, and dashes; and he did not hesitate to introduce punctuation where there was none in the MS, to alter punctuation where he thought it desirable to do so, to change single quotation marks to double, to reduce several initial capitals to lower case, to capitalize in at least one instance of lower case, and eight times to expand to full endings of ed and ough words such as "Cracked" and "through", which in MS, according to Tennyson's custom, were written "Crack'd" and "thro'". Inconsistently, though, the proof reproduced twenty-seven such endings as they had appeared in MS 3 and had "shatter'd" for "shattered" (250). These variations in accidentals the poet disregarded except in the passage concerning the Oread (188-192). The compositor, making the description of her stand alone as a sentence and wrenching the meaning by introducing a query in line 192, had set the passage thus: And here an Oread. How the sun delights To glance and shift about her slipping sides And rosy knees, and supple roundedness, And budded bosom peaks. Who this way runs Before the rest? A satyr—a satyr—see— Follows . . . . The poet's pen lowered two capitals and repunctuated these lines to read: And here an Oread—how the sun delights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .bosom peaks—who this way runs Before the rest—A satyr, a satyr, see— Follows . . . . The corrections reflect the poet's firm intention that the physical description of the Oread be parenthetical and that "who this way runs" be a statement of the direction and the nature of her motion instead of a query as to her identity or a question (which the compositor and Grove—see below—seem to have wanted) leading to the introduction of the satyr. The latter interpretation made no sense, since the satyr could not both run before the rest and follow. Despite Tennyson's diligent attention to the details of the passage, he failed to note "slipping" that Emily in MS 3 had miscopied for "slippery" and the hyphen that she had omitted from "bosom-peaks". Yet in the immediately preceding lines he deleted the plural s that she had given to "Nymph" and to "Faun" (187) and decided to change dashes to commas in line 186. Since none of these emendations appears in the next state of the text, it is unlikely that P 1 was returned to the editor; and certainly the type for the first page proof cannot have been corrected from it. There must, however, have been another galley on which Grove or Clay remedied the four obvious typographical errors that Tennyson had marked, for these read correctly in the first two subsequent proofs extant, though the other four mistakes by the compositor persist. All later surviving proofs are page proofs. Collation reveals that the set belonging to Mr. Macmillan (P 2 ) and the first of those in the Berg Collection (P 3 ) were pulled from the same type. But Tennyson's corrections in P 3 advance it considerably further toward the ultimate text than do those on P 2 . Including the bowdlerized version of the Oread, which Ricks has described, there are ninety-two alterations, both substantives and accidentals, on P 2 and ninety-nine on P 3 . Sixty-eight are common to both proofs, and there are fifty-five variant changes between them. But the next proof recognizes all the corrections on P 3 and none of the variants on P 2 . The following substantive corrections (with their associated accidentals) that are not on P 2 appear on P 3 : Letterpress of P 2 and P 3 Tennyson's Altered Reading on P 3 goatherds neat-herds (88) 23 I know you careless, yet Careless, I know you careless, yet to you, to you, to you (208) 24 Strike Dash (246) . . . "It is done; . . . "Care not thou! What matters? What is duty? . . . What matters? All is over: . . .(279-280) 25 Tennyson probably received P 2 and P 3 as duplicate sets of proof and began correcting one of them (P 2 ), where he first altered a comma to a period after his name and struck out " POET LAUREATE. " under it. When he came to the Oread—the passage was still punctuated exactly as it had been in P 1 —he set off the full description of her with a dash over the period after "Oread", a parenthesis before "How", and a closed parenthesis instead of a period after "peaks". He changed "slipping" to "slippery" and gave the hyphen to "bosom-peaks". He also made the capital in "Who" lower case, removed the unwanted question mark after "rest", added a dash, and altered the dashes after each "satyr" to commas. Thereupon, or as the result of reconsideration later, he heavily excised lines 188-192 and inserted in the margin in their place: "And here an Oread—&amp; this way she runs | Before the rest—A Satyr, a Satyr, see, | Follows;". After revising this proof extensively, he apparently abandoned it and made all his corrections for the printer on the duplicate (P 3 ). 26 In doing so, he did not systematically transfer his corrections from one proof to the other, since, including the deleted " POET LAUREATE ." and the alternate lines about the Oread, twenty-four changes on P 2 are not to be found on P 3 . 27 (Conversely, there are thirty-one changes on P 3 that do not occur on P 2 .) Having decided to let the full account of the Oread stand, he once again on P 3 repunctuated the lines (this time using dashes alone for the parenthetical description), corrected "slipping" to "slippery", hyphenated "bosom-peaks", and reduced "How" as well as "Who" to lower case. In P 3 as in P 2 , he revised the typographical errors: "proæmion" to "proœmion" and "O thou" to "for O Thou"; but he still overlooked the compositor's "hand" for "hands" and "backwards" for "backward". Several of the substantive alterations introduced on both proofs require comment. Two added lines—"The fire that left a roofless Ilion," (65) and "That stays the rolling Ixionian wheel," (260)—enrich the allusiveness of the contexts in which they appear; and transposing lines 211-212 to relate to each other so—"No lewdness, narrowing envy, monkey-spite | No madness of ambition, avarice, none;"—improved the order and logical progression of the evils that Lucretius believes he has escaped. In describing the effect of the philter upon Lucretius, Tennyson not only varied the syntax, which had repeated that of the line before, but enhanced both the scientific accuracy and the conflict between the human and the bestial in Lucretius by substituting for Tickled the brute part of the brain, and made Havock . . . the reading And tickling the brute brain within the man's Made havock . . . . (21-22) Replacing "to drink" with "to take" (214), in the passage about drinking with neighbors on the grass, muted any note of excess that the former verb might carry and furthered the tone of moderation and restrained enjoyment. In another instance, while regularizing a foot in the line of blank verse may have been a factor, concern over the fleshliness of the poem seems to have led him to excise "Naked" in describing the Hetairai (52). Without doubt Tennyson's letter to Macmillan, dated Shrove Tuesday, 1868 (February 25), which belongs to Mr. W. S. G. Macmillan and which Ricks first published, refers to P 3 and may have accompanied it to the publisher. 28 In this letter the author said: I had rather if you have no objection see my Lucretius once again. If you don't publish before May—(have you decided upon it) there will be ample time to send it out to ['send it out' deleted ] to Fields. Payne has put me into a great perplexity by advertising the Standard Edition in his tremendous style—before any agreement was signed &amp; before I had made up my mind as to whether I would have one at all. I expect now that if I do not publish this edition (and I have little desire to do it) the sale of the ['othe' deleted ] old one will fall off in expectation of this. . . . Then there is a postscript across the top of the sheet, "I left in the Oread —do you wish her out?" When Macmillan wrote two days later, he referred to this letter. By some means Tennyson had conveyed to Grove and Macmillan the expurgated version of the Oread and had expressed a wish for the poem to appear in larger type than that of articles in the magazine: Feb: 27. 1868. Dear Mr Tennyson, You shall certainly have a fresh proof. I had ordered the next in the larger type which you seemed to prefer. Grove seemed to prefer the shorter description of the Oread. On the whole the balance of taste seems in favour of it. You shall see both, and I will leave you &amp; Grove to decide. You will no doubt arrange that the ucretius does not come in the Standard Edition till the last volume. Have you settled the order? Grove will write you again [in] a few days. Yours ever faithfully Alex. Macmillan. (Add. MSS. 55388(1), fol. 66) As a result of Macmillan's decision to enlarge the type (he went from 9 to 10 point and increased the leading between lines), a complete resetting, with its consequent opportunity for compositor's errors, was necessary. Moreover, the larger type and more generous leading expanded the text onto an additional page, though it is wanting in the next Berg proof (P 4 ). This proof, which Tennyson never saw, contains the full description of the Oread with all the corrections that he made in it on P 3 . Clay sent P 4 to Grove with the notation in ink, written across the top of the first page, "A few suggestions in punctuation | are submitted in this proof | RC". When Grove had finished his review of Clay's suggestions and had made his own corrections, he returned the proof with the printer's note struck out and this direction in ink above it: " 2 revises to Mr r Grove by return Feb. 29". Since the ink and width of pen differ, it is clear which are Clay's and which are Grove's proofreading marks. Grove approved all Clay's suggestions and made two revisions of his own in accidentals (removal of a diacritical mark over the second a in "Cadmeän" [50] and substitution of a period for a dash at the end of a line [218]). There were three egregious errors, however, that Clay had failed to recognize. Although Grove marked them, and they were corrected, they eventually corrupted the text as published in America. The first two resulted from the compositor's misunderstanding of emendations on P 3 . Instead of the intended, "And tickling the brute brain within the man's", he set, "And tickling the brute within the man's brain". "Careless", which Tennyson wrote at the beginning of the line before "I" (208), he substituted for a deleted "to you", so that the wording became, "I know you careless, yet careless, to you". In the third instance (209), he simply misread "childly wont" in P 3 and put "chilly want". One other typographical error eluded Grove—a w for an h , making "halls" into "walls" in "windy halls of heaven" (136). Grove's and Clay's emendations were accomplished that day, and the two revises which the editor had ordered were sent back to him (a tab pasted on the uncorrected one bears Clay's name and the date "Feb. 29, 1868."). These proofs still contained the full description of the Oread (188-191), but the expurgated version with the succeeding line about the satyr ("And here an Oread—and this way she runs | Before the rest—A Satyr, a Satyr, see") had been printed on a slip of paper, which, forming an overlay for lines 188-192, had been tipped in at the righthand end on the set that went to Tennyson (P 5 ). 29 Grove dispatched this proof to the author on March 2, accompanied by the following letter: MACMILLAN'S MAGAZINE. Lower Sydenham March 2/68 Dear M r Tennyson, Enclosed is Lucretius in his last stage with the alternative version of the Oread I have put a query or two at some places where the punctuation seemed to me wrong. which you will pardon with your usual clemency. For the public perhaps the new Oread is the best—though I confess I love the old one—only I find fault with the "who" (who this way runs")—I cant read it without an emphasis on the who, and then I am obliged to make a question of it "who this way runs before the rest?" "Vast and filthy hand" I prefer han ds as it was in the original MS. "But who was he" &amp;c This seems to me very abrupt—to spring from nothing that has gone before (my ignorance doubtless), and the very " but " itself helps the feeling. "Nymph and Faun" I prefer Nymph s and Faun s . Is the singular ever used ['for' deleted ] in the case of animate or intelligent creatures? "into oak and ash"—I should not mind—but the other displeases me a little. "Dash them afresh" the sh seems to me to go badly with that in afre sh —and the dash has a rude sound of collision, not like the operation of nature or of atomic nature:—would not "force" or "thrust" be better. "Care not thou" is not an improvement—the idea is better than the old one, but the words are awkward I think—on the whole I like the 2 last lines better as they stood before ------------- I know the Poem now pretty well: and every time I say it to myself like it better &amp; see more force in it. Please do some Old Testament subjects in the same way My kindest regards to M rs Tennyson Yours ever G. Grove 1865-6 [in Good Words for March] is lovely—and so full of life—a trifle—but what a trifle (Tennyson Research Centre)? One of the editor's two queries in the margin of P 5 suggested a semicolon instead of a comma after "nor" in line 132. Tennyson let the comma stand by crossing out Grove's marks; but the question stimulated him to change the comma at the end of the line to a semicolon. The second query appears to have proposed a period to replace a dash at the end of line 248. The poet also rejected this alteration, though one should note that he did not demur to any of the accidentals that Clay and Grove had contributed to the text on P 4 . Tennyson disregarded most of the strictures in Grove's letter, but he changed "hand" to "hands" (220) and "afresh" to "anew" (246). The editor's still wanting to read "who this way runs | Before the rest" as a question doubtless prompted him to set these words off in the long version by parentheses in preference to the existing dashes. Also, in the full text he converted the semicolons in "A satyr; a satyr;" (192) to commas. "To peer behind the laurels" became "What?—that the bush were leafless?" (206); and deleting the initial "careless" and inserting "behold", set off in commas after "yet" (208), at last solved that troublesome line. "Kupris" he made "Kypris" (95). Further, he contracted "although" to "altho'" (133), added at the ends of lines 204 and 205 a comma and a dash respectively, and inserted a comma after the last word of line 258. The next day he returned P 5 to Grove with this letter: Farringford, Freshwater, Isle of Wight. March 3 rd 1868 My dear Grove To peer behind the laurels is to me the least decorous passage in the poem. I have altered it —do I wish— What? that the bush were leafless, or &amp;c. then I know you careless, yet behold, to you "backward" instead of backwards I never put an unnecessary S. hand for hands is the printers not mine Pray let this be sent off by the next American mail, I believe, on Thursday or Fields will say it has come too late— With respect to the Oread please yourself but send the full passage to America—They are not so squeamish as we are. 30 Yours my dear Grove in great haste A Tennyson Kypris for Kupris anew for afresh Despite the concern for decorousness that Tennyson's removing "To peer behind the laurels" indicates, he stood by his own preference for the unexpurgated Oread by drawing a slanting vertical line from left to right across the tipped-in alternative. When this proof came back from the author, it went to the printer with the notation in ink in the upper left-hand corner, though not in Grove's hand, "3 Revises | instantly." After Tennyson's corrections on P 5 had been set, "Lucretius" had all but reached its final state for Macmillan's Magazine . On March 4, Mrs. Tennyson wrote Fields to tell him that her husband had requested Grove to send him "Lucretius" "by the next mail tho' it is not to be published until May" (University of Virginia). Grove must have conveyed one of the revises of P 5 to Tennyson, who also wrote Fields in these words: Farringford, Freshwater, Isle of Wight. March 10/68 My dear Mr Fields The Editor of Macmillan's Mag. tells me that according to my request he has forwarded to you Lucretius. I find a misprint in the proofs sent to me "windy W alls" instead of "Halls of Heaven"—pray correct it when you insert the piece in your May number. Believe me Yours very truly A Tennyson (Wellesley College) Contrary to Tennyson's belief that the poem had already gone to America, a week apparently elapsed before it was in fact posted to Fields along with a letter from Macmillan, dated March 17, 1868, in which he wrote: I send you by this mail, enclosed in this letter, Tennyson's magnificent poem Lucretius. It will appear in the May number of our Magazine, and so also of course in the May Atlantic. On Saturday a duplicate will follow. You will see an alternative reading. I have hardly made up my mind which to adopt. Everyone who has seen it here says it is quite the grandest thing he has written. I wonder what you *will [ interlined ] think of it (Add. MSS. 55388(1), fol. 141). It is odd that in spite of Tennyson's injunction to Grove about sending the full Oread to America, Macmillan included the alternative version, without any indication as to the poet's preference, and that he professed himself still undecided as to which lines to use in Macmillan's after what both he and the editor had previously written to Farringford. At any rate, Tennyson turned out to have judged the Americans correctly. From Macmillan's letter one would assume that he sent Fields a proof pulled from the type after Tennyson's corrections on P 5 had been made, with the expurgated Oread tipped or folded in. (It had been approximately two weeks since three revises instantly had been called for.) And, indeed, except for the emendation of line 208 to read "I know you careless, yet, behold, to you", all Tennyson's significant changes on P 5 had been incorporated when the poem appeared in America: "Kypris", "What? that the bush were leafless?", "hands", "backward", "anew", and the description of the Oread set off in parentheses instead of dashes. 31 Yet one of the two proofs mailed to Fields, through some unaccountable mistake, must have been an uncorrected or incompletely corrected duplicate of P 4 , for sixteen readings in the letterpress of that proof, both substantives and accidentals, that Clay, Grove, or Tennyson had altered either on P 4 or P 5 appeared in Every Saturday . These included the three major blunders by the compositor in setting P 4 : "And tickling the brute within the man's brain" (21), "I know you careless, yet careless, to you" (208), and "chilly want" (209). 32 After receiving Tennyson's letter of March 10 that a proof of "Lucretius" had been sent, Fields, on March 30, informed the poet that it had not arrived and requested a duplicate immediately (Add. MSS. 54986, fol. 209 v ). When this news reached Farringford, Emily Tennyson, on April 13, addressing her letter to Grove or Macmillan, asked that "another copy of Lucretius" be sent "by the Thursday's post" (Add. MSS. 54986, fol. 207). The next day Macmillan responded: . . . tomorrow—Wednesday *&amp; Saturday [ interlined ] are the post days—we shall send him the first sheet of the Magazine which contains the Poem. We had already sent him two proofs by letter post—one on March 17 &amp; the other on March 20. There can be no doubt that he had them both in ample time for the May Atlantic (Add. MSS. 55388(1), fol. 236). His confidence was of course misplaced, and the copy of the first sheet of the magazine cannot have reached Fields before Every Saturday went to press or presumably some of the errors would have been rectified. A proof of the first octavo gathering of Macmillan's , which bears Tennyson's autograph in the upper right-hand corner of the first page (P 6 ), is extant in the Berg Collection. It embraces all Tennyson's alterations on P 5 , and "halls" (136) shows correctly. In addition, there are three variants in punctuation that he had not marked for change: "abroad:" has become "abroad;" (88), "spit," appears as "spit—" (132), and "Oread—" reads "Oread," (188). The only proofreader's marks on P 6 are a stroke under the comma after "LUCRETIUS," in the title, and "q." in the right-hand margin. The query seems to be the printer's rather than the editor's or Tennyson's. A period replaced the comma when the poem appeared in Macmillan's . 33 At the end of April, when the May issue was at last published and on the very day that the first review appeared in the Pall Mall Gazette , Macmillan wrote thus to Emily Tennyson: April 29. 1868. Dear Mrs Tennyson I am not sure whether Mr Tennyson has gone home, so I address the enclosed cheque to you, as, even if he were about, he would probably not care to have the charge of it. It is indeed a great honour to have this noble poem in our pages. I cannot conceive that it should be felt to be other than noble in art &amp; in purpose by any one. I have had much pleasure in seeing him two or three times lately. How well he looks! I thought he was worrying himself about some affairs. If he or you think I can be of use in any way you know how glad I would be. I will run down at any time to see &amp; talk any matters over with you. Yours very faithfully A. Macmillan. (Add. MSS. 55388(1), fol. 301) To Macmillan's letter of March 15, Fields replied good-humoredly as follows: TICKNOR AND FIELDS, publishers, Boston, May 4 th . 1868. My dear Macmillan Tennyson's "Lucretius" did not reach us in time for our May Atlantic. We printed it in our "Every Saturday", and it was immediately cribbed all over the country and printed in magazines and newspapers. It was a great disappointment to us not to have it for the Atlantic, but we did the next best thing left us and put it into the weekly. You ask me what I think of the poem. It is a very grand and Tennysonian piece, but I do not agree with those of your friends who say: "it is quite the grandest thing he has written." Parts of it are in his loftiest vein, but I still hold by "Ulysses", "The death of Arthur", and "In Memoriam" With kind regards from Mrs. Fields to your wife and yourself. Ever faithfully yours J.T. Fields. I enclose you a new poem by Lowell which goes into our June Atlantic. You are welcome to use it in your magazine if it arrives in season (Add. MSS. 54891, fols. 49-50) 34</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Considering the sensual explicitness of "Lucretius," its reception in England was remarkably favorable. Benjamin Jowett wrote Emily Tennyson, "I thought 'Lucretius' a most noble poem, and that is the universal impression," though as Masson had predicted, the poem did "not pass without" some "yelping on various sides" ( Memoir , II, 55; Buckler, p. 270, and Letters to Macmillan , p. 115). Macmillan, true to his promise to stop its being plundered in Great Britain, printed a prefatory note declaring that extracts to indicate the character of the new work "must be confined to moderate length, and that the reproduction of either the whole or the major part of 'Lucretius' will be an infringement of the law of copyright . . . and not needed for the legitimate purposes of criticism." This note, which does not appear in the bound volume of Macmillan's , was quoted in its entirety in Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper (May 10, p. 8). Lloyd's , while referring to "Lucretius" as "a high utterance of . . . [the poet's] genius," took vehement exception to Macmillan's prohibition of lengthy extracts and refused, as a consequence, to make any quotation from the poem—"we will take not a single hair from the tail of their expensive Pegasus." The daily Sun , in a survey of the magazines for the month of May, also alluded to this deterrent, remarking that the proprietors of Macmillan's "seem especially jealous" of the poem, and said that it was not in Tennyson's "happiest vein" (May 1, p. [3]). The Globe and Traveller , an evening paper, in noticing the magazines on May 5, said that "Lucretius" was "almost worthy of Mr. Robert Browning" (p. [1]). The Sunday Times , on May 10, found the ending abrupt and the poem "disfigured with such stupid periphrases as 'hired animalisms,' and such ill-chosen expressions as the term 'apple-arbiter,' which is applied to Paris" (p. 7). Two religious periodicals, the Literary World (a monthly supplement to the Christian World ) for May 15 and the Christian Observer for June, deplored Tennyson's choice of subject matter (I, 42) and the sight of "the first poet of this Christian land" conveying "the benighted sentiments of a heathen philosopher pleading for self-destruction" (pp. 467-471). In contrast to these scattered notes of disparagement, there was a chorus of praise for the artistry of the poem and the distinction of its blank verse—even the Literary World admired "the workmanship" of the monologue and the Christian Observer alluded to its "majestic verse." The first review to appear, on April 29 in the Pall Mall Gazette , an evening daily of high literary repute, owned by George Murray Smith and edited by Frederick Greenwood, set the prevailing tone of adulation (pp. 11-12). 35 Its writer ridiculed the false gentility of those who thought Tennyson should be above publishing in magazines and reminded readers that "Tithonus"—one of the finest pieces of Tennyson's art, to which "Lucretius" was in every way comparable—had been published in the Cornhill . In treating the subject, the poet had avoided the imaginative "splendours" that Robert Lytton (first Earl of Lytton [1831-1891], who wrote under the nom de plume "Owen Meredith") might have lavished on Lucilia and the excesses that would have been typical of Swinburne, "not out of squeamishness simply, but because he chose to be faithful to his work rather than splendid in it." He had succeeded in writing of eroticism and animal passion "so that not even the most feverish libertine might find a line for his enjoyment" or anything to tickle a "prurient fancy." On Saturday, May 2, four laudatory reviews appeared in weekly journals. The Imperial Review reported "Lucretius" to be "in every way worthy of the author of In Memoriam and the Idylls of the King " and of equal rank with those "exquisite" poems "Œnone" and "Tithonus" (3, 413-414). The Inquirer wrote of the poem, "It is one of the finest bits of blank verse that . . . [Tennyson] has ever written, and may be compared with his well-known 'Tithonus' . . ." (27, 277). In a detailed critique of the poem the London Review and Weekly Journal referred to "Lucretius" as "a very beautiful work of art," a "striking and impressive poem" (16, 429); and the Spectator , now exerting renewed influence under the joint editorship of Richard Holt Hutton and Meredith Townsend, devoted a "middle article" to what it considered "a grand poem, which will live with Mr. Tennyson's finest creations" (41, 523-524). 36 The next Saturday, May 9, Macmillan quoted a brief extract from each of these reviews in an advertisement in the Athenaeum (59, 676), presumably not "vulgar" advertising, and four more weeklies—the Examiner (p. 296), the Illustrated London News (52, 471), the Illustrated Times (12, 346), 37 and Punch (54,205)—assessed the poem favorably. Punch 's humorous questionnaire on the new work, in order for diners-out to be prepared to discuss it at dinner-parties, testifies to the wide-spread attention "Lucretius" was attracting. On Monday Macmillan directed this letter to the poet's wife: May 11, 1868 My dear Mrs Tennyson, I hope I am not boring you in sending notices that appear in the papers about "Lucretius." It is a habit we have in regard to our books generally, but some authors—I dont blame them—dislike all these pattings on the head, or slappings in the face from men whose praise or blame often is equally worthless. The Pall Mall, Spectator &amp; Punch are about the best. Would Mr Tennyson care to look at Mr Jebbs article on the poem &amp; the subject? It seems to me very delicately done. I hope you are all well, and that the mild gai[e]ties of Clapham have not disturbed him. 38 With kindest regards to the Poet &amp; the boys. Yours very faithfully Alex Macmillan. (Add. MSS. 55388(1), fol. 340) She replied the next day: Farringford, Freshwater, Isle of Wight. May 12 th 1868 Dear Mr Macmillan, It is very kind in you sending the favourable reviews. Unless there be anything you particularly wish him to see perhaps he has now seen enough *when he has seen the Jebb you mention [ interlined ]. Those three you name are decidedly the best, I think. "The Nation", the most impertinent *I have seen as a whole [ interlined ] I have fortunately been able to hide from him The beginning of the Cosmopolitan, equally impertinent, he saw. . . . 39 [ P.S. ] He seems to enjoy his Clapham visits, thank you. We shall be very anxious to know that you are not a loser by Lucretius (Add. MSS. 54986, fols. 213-214). On the same day that Macmillan wrote to Mrs. Tennyson, The Times issued a resounding encomium by Eneas Sweetland Dallas, who declared "Lucretius" to be "a poem of such power as to demand a notice"—recognition that The Times did "not usually accord to works issued" in a magazine (May 11, p. 12). 40 For him it was "a magnificent piece"; and as if to answer the London Review , which had complained of "'experiments' in versification" in such lines as 30, 40, 53, and 126, 41 he exalted Tennyson as "unapproachable since Milton" for "the melody" of his verse. "To whom, if not to such a man," Dallas demanded, "are we to allow the liberty of altering the rhythm of blank verse?" Two days later, May 13, the weekly Guardian , in an extended commentary continued the panegyrical strain (23, 564); and by May 20, the Nonconformist could announce, "Tennyson's Lucretius has more than sustained its great reputation. The last number of Macmillan's Magazine has already reached a third edition in consequence of its appearance" (p. 511)—the answer to Emily's fears that Macmillan might lose financially on the poem. At the end of the month, by a letter dated May 29, Macmillan was able to inform Jebb, I was with Tennyson last Sunday [May 24]. He asked particularly about your article &amp; I chanced to have a proof in my bag so I gave it him. He liked it &amp; said it told him at least one thing he could not remember—where the story of Picus &amp; Faunus is to be found [Ovid's Fasti ] (Add. MSS. 55388(1), fol. 399). Jebb's purpose, in his signed piece in Macmillan's for June, was to demonstrate the "historical truth" of Tennyson's Lucretius as a value of the work going beyond its simply artistic quality (18, [97]-103). Not that one had to have read De Rerum Natura "in order to enjoy" the poem; but the Laureate had "been very successful in reproducing that impression of Lucretius which is derived from the Latin . . . not by direct imitation or allusion; not by the painting of particular striking traits; but by a force of imaginative sympathy which seizes and represents their result." Tinsley's Magazine for July gave "Lucretius" further critical approbation: it would "rank among the best" of Tennyson's poems (2, 611-616). His treatment was severe and "chaste," compared to "the pruriency" that might have been expected from Swinburne. Finally, in October, the Methodist London Quarterly Review , after extolling the poet as "a well-versed psychologist" and "a consummate artist," applauded the blank verse as "of the finest and richest quality that Mr. Tennyson has produced . . ." (31, 249-254). Furthermore, he was heartily to be congratulated—"at a time when Swinburne is read and apparently relished"—that "the moralist can find no weak or erring point in Lucretius ." The London Quarterly Review , however, provided in a footnote the full version of the Oread from a Canadian edition to indicate the "narrow escape" that English readers had had from "a very considerable blemish," to which Americans had been subjected. This reviewer also singled out one line for objection: "Poor little life that toddles half an hour" (228), in which he found the idea dramatically sound "but the expression 'toddles half an hour' . . . too trivial and inelegant for propriety in so austere and grand an entourage ." Despite Tennyson's recognized sensitivity to criticism, when he republished "Lucretius" in the Holy Grail and Other Poems (1870), issued in December, 1869, he ignored all such strictures on lines or phrases; and in the face of the London Quarterly Review (though one cannot be certain that he saw it), he restored to the text the complete description of the Oread. A significant substantive change in the last line of the poem—in part a return to the reading of MS 2 through P 3 —suggests, however, that he may have taken into account the commentary of this critic, who regretted Lucilia's reappearance, and after quoting the passage describing it, wrote as follows: This is lamentably prosaic and out of place: and having once fallen out of the lofty vein of thought and expression antecendently characteristic of the poem, Mr. Tennyson appears to have been incapable of rising again to the exigencies of the occasion when the speech is given to Lucretius once more; for, when the dying lips are again unlocked, it is only to utter the poor trite words— "Care not thou! What matters? All is over: fare thee well!" Tennyson, to be sure, did not dispense with Lucilia, but Lucretius' biddings to her lacked direct pertinence to the theme and were indeed rather banal. Grove also had expressed a preference for the earlier language of the last line: "What matters? What is duty? Fare thee well!" 42 By re-introducing the idea of duty—which Lucretius echoes from Lucilia's berating herself for "having fail'd in duty to him" (277)—and by intensifying it in the final text ("Thy duty? What is duty? Fare thee well!") Tennyson both increased the dramatic interplay between Lucretius and his wife (which had become flaccid in the previous reading) and preserved to the very end the poem's ironic emphasis on spiritual values. Afterward, there would be further polishing of accidentals; and a change of "And" to "That" (261) occurred in the Eversley Edition. 43 But with the felicitous stroke in the concluding line, seemingly slight yet quite consequential, the poet essentially completed the involved process of fashioning "Lucretius."</field>

The spine has been reinforced with orange tape that overlaps approximately 1½” on both front and back covers. On a piece of white cloth tape, 2” long, pasted in the middle of the spine, is printed by hand in ink, vertically with the spine, reading down, 'Lucretius. The Victim.' In addition to "Lucretius" this notebook contains "1865-1866," "The Victim," "Immeasurable sadness," "History," and a few draft fragments of other poems. The leaves of blue laid paper, watermarked 'E Towgood | 1863' and measuring 6⅜” x 9⅛”, have been numbered in pencil; and MS 2 , which bears no title, appears on fols. 4 v -14. The versos of fols. 5-8, 11-13 are blank; fol. 9 v carries four and a half lines (173-177) to be substituted for one and a half lines deleted on fol. 10 opposite, and fol. 10 v has four lines (213-216) to be inserted before a deleted line that preceded l. 217 on fol. 11. MS in the Beinecke Library, Yale University. MS 3 , in the poet's wife's hand with Tennyson's autograph corrections, at Yale, consists of a single gathering, folded once, of eighteen leaves of blue laid paper, watermarked with a design and measuring 6⅜” x 9”. Leaves 1-12, on which the untitled poem appears (the versos are blank) have been numbered in pencil; the remaining six leaves are blank and unnumbered. The MS has been bound in blue laid paper measuring 6⅞” x 9¼”, which is watermarked in the front cover 'Towgood's Extra Super' and in the back cover with a design of the Queen seated, holding a ball in her right hand, and having a spear and shield at her left side. The white thread sewing the gathering is loose but still partly stuck to the cover, which was pasted on. In the top half of the front cover, George Grove, the editor of Macmillan's has written, ' Take great care of this MS . | Set it up in Slip and ['send' deleted ] pull one | proof only —which send with the | MS. to M r .

P 1 , in the Lincoln Research Centre, has the poet's autograph corrections and consists of three columns of letterpress on a single demy sheet of white wove paper, 17½” x 22½”. The upper left-hand corner of the sheet has been torn away, so that the first word of the first and of the second lines ('Lucilia' and 'Her') and the upper part of both letters of the first word in the third line ('Of') are missing. Two columns of letterpress appear vertically on the sheet, with the third column printed horizontally below them. The second and third columns carry the printed numbers '2' and '3' in their respective upper right-hand corners. There are one hundred one lines in the first column, one hundred eight in the second, and sixty-nine in the third. The type is 9-point Scotch Roman, the usual type for articles in Macmillan's Magazine . The lower left-hand corner of the sheet is also torn away. As in the MSS, no title of the poem or author's name precedes the text. Page Proof Owned by Mr. W. S. G. Macmillan. P 2 , belonging to Mr. Macmillan, is printed in 9-point Scotch Roman, imposed 41 lines to the page, on white wove paper, measuring (with slight variations) 5¾” x 9” and paginated [351]-358. The first page is headed 'MACMILLAN'S MAGAZINE. | MAY, 1868. | [ rule ] | LUCRETIUS, | By ALFRED TENNYSON, | POET LAUREATE . | [ rule ]'. 'No. 104.—vol. xvii.' occurs on the bottom left-hand of the page, and the signature 'b' is on the bottom right-hand. The running title ' Lucretius .' is centered at the top of each succeeding page. Tennyson's autograph corrections are numerous. This proof is bound in red morocco covers, measuring 6¼” x 9¼”, with gilt lettering on the spine and gilt-edged leaves. The spine reads vertically from top to bottom, '[ vine design ] LUCRETIUS.—ALFRED TENNYSON [ vine design ]'. 'Lib.A.' has been written in pencil on the upper left-hand corner of the second front flyleaf. A small white tab ⅞” square, bearing the number '112.' in ink, has been pasted in the lower left-hand corner of the inside back cover. Page Proofs in the Berg Collection, New York Public Library. Three successive sets of proof—P 3-5 —and an uncorrected duplicate of P 5 are preserved in the Berg Collection in a green morocco slip case by Riviere. The spine reads in gilt letters, 'LUCRETIUS | [ short rule ] | TENNYSON | WITH | CORRECTIONS | BY THE | AUTHOR'; below there is a tab pasted on, which, reading up vertically with the spine, carries the notation in ink 'Case 1.' In all typographical details, P 3 , printed on white wove paper approximately 5⅞” x 9⅛”, corresponds to P 2 above, and the poet's alterations are even more extensive. The number '3572c' has been penciled on the upper left-hand corner of the first page, the stamped number 179404B stands on the bottom right of p. 357, and 'THE NEW YORK | PUBLIC LIBRARY' within a double-ruled oblong box has been stamped just below the letterpress in the center of p. 358. P 4 , of which the pages measure approximately 6” x 8frac1116”, shows the same heading, date, title, and author's name and office as P 2 and P 3 , but the volume number differs, so that the lower left-hand of the first page carries, 'No. 104.—vol. xviii.'; and the signature 'b' appears in the center of the page immediately below the letterpress instead of on the right-hand. The running title ' Lucretius .' duplicates that of the two preceding proofs. Owing to an increase in the size of type from 9 to 10 point, imposed 38 lines to the page, the text of the poem runs one page longer than in P 2 and P 3 , i.e., pp. [351]-359, but p. 359 is wanting. P 4 bears corrections by Richard Clay, the printer, and by Grove, but none by the poet. Across the top of p. [351] is the notation in ink. 'A few suggestions in the punctuation | are recommended in this proof | RC'. Slanting strokes of the pen, with a squiggle over 'RC', cancel this comment; and above it in ink, Grove has inserted the direction, ' 2 Revises to M r Grove by return Feb. 29'. The upper left-hand corner also has in pencil, '3572a'. The number '179401B' has been stamped at the bottom right of p. 357, and the stamp of the New York Public Library shows on p. 358 below the last line of type (270). P 5 , of which the white wove pages measure approximately 6” x 9⅛”, is in all details of heading, date, title, author's name and office, number, volume, signature, running title, size of type, and pagination identical to P 4 except that, having p. 359, it contains the complete text of the poem. It bears Tennyson's autograph corrections and, in the upper left-hand corner of the first page, carries the direction in ink (not in Grove's hand) between two slanting horizontal lines, measuring in length ¾” and 1” respectively, '3 Revises | instantly.' Also just below, in the same corner, is the number '3572b' in pencil. The text contains the full description of the Oread; and a slip, on which is printed the expurgated version and the line following, has been tipped in to the margin at the right-hand end to form an overlay (which can be lifted from the left end) for lines 188-192. On p. 357 at the bottom right, there is the stamped number '179402B', and the New York Public Library stamp appears at the bottom of p. 358 and on the blank verso of p. 359. The uncorrected duplicate of P 5 has pasted on the upper left-hand corner of the first page a printed tab that contains the following: 'Feb. 29, 1868. | From R. Clay's | Printing Office , | Bread Street Hill . 2 A.P. S.711.' ('Feb. 29,', '68' and '2 A.P. S.711.' have been filled in by hand in ink.) Two folded slips, upon each of which is printed the expurgated version of the Oread and the line following, lie between pp. 352 and 353. Page 359 of this proof is missing. The New York Public Library stamp appears at the bottom of p. 358. P 6 , the final proof in the Berg Collection, is in a brown cloth folding case, measuring 6¼” x 9”, the spine of which reads vertically from top to bottom in gilt letters, 'LUCRETIUS—TENNYSON—MACMILLAN'S. MAY 1868 (FIRST APPEARANCE SIGNED)'. A pasted tab at the bottom of the spine, reading down, shows in ink '[Cas]e 2'. This proof is an unsewn first octavo gathering for Macmillan's Magazine , in which the text of "Lucretius" covers pp. [1]-9 and is followed on pp. 10-16 by an article entitled "Luxury and the Scholar." The pages measure approximately 6¼” x 9”; all typographical details of the poem correspond to P 5 with the following exceptions: the issue number at the bottom left-hand of the first page is 'No. 103.' instead of 'No. 104.', the signature 'b' is to the right below the letter-press instead of in the center, the signature 'b2' appears to the right below the letterpress on p. 3, and the poem has been imposed 37 lines to the page instead of 38. In the center at the bottom of p. [1] there is the penciled number '2983', the stamped number 179405B stands at the bottom right of p. 9, and the New York Public Library stamp appears in the center at the foot of p. 16. On P 6 the only proofreading marks (apparently the printer's and not Tennyson's) question whether a period should be substituted for a comma after the title of the poem. The poet's autograph, 'ATennyson', occupies the upper right-hand corner of p. [1]. Proof Copy in the Beinecke Library, Yale University. The text of this uncorrected proof copy (Call no. Rare Book Room | Ip | T258 | 868La), except for a missing exclamation mark at the end of l. 279, is identical with that printed in Macmillan's . The heading of the first page, however, does not have the name and date of the magazine, the number and volume do not appear at the bottom of the page, and the signature is lacking (though as in Macmillan's , the signature b2 appears to the right at the foot of the third page of type). The nine pages of the poem (37 lines to the page) have been printed on the rectos only of nine unnumbered gilt-edged leaves, measuring 5½” x 8½”. Folios [2]-[9] have the running title ' Lucretius. '; the versos are blank. This proof copy, which is bound in purple pebbled boards, measuring 5⅞” x 8¾”, has the title 'LUCRETIUS.' in gilt between rules on the front cover. The inside front and back covers are yellow, as are the end papers. At the top of the inside front cover in pencil is the partially erroneous notation, '1 st. Edit | Galley proof of Lucretius as | published in Macmillan's Magazine | May 1868.' Also on the front inside cover is the Yale University Library bookplate, carrying the information 'Gift of | HENRY C. HUTCHINS'. The letters 'N/E/B' in pencil occur on the upper middle portion of the inside back cover; and in the lower left-hand corner, a white card 3” x 3¾” has been pasted bearing the following: 'MAY 21, 1959 [ stamped ] | Gift [ printed ] Mr. Henry C. Hutchins [ typed ] | Collation [ printed ] 9 l. [ typed ] | Author [ printed ] Tennyson, Alfred Tennyson, | 1st baron, 1809-1892 [ typed ] | Call no.

      <field name="fulltext">HISTORICAL COLLATION This collation comprises the substantive and accidental readings in the documents listed (with corresponding symbols in order of composition or publication) that vary from the authoritative text of the poem in the Eversley Edition (1907), which Tennyson and his son annotated. As a matter of convenience and to save space, Tennyson is referred to as AT and his wife as ET. All proofs are for Macmillan's Magazine .

London: Strahan and Co., 1870 G(A) The Holy Grail, and Other Poems . Boston: Fields, Osgood, &amp; Co., 1870 The methods used for recording both textual variations and alterations in the manuscripts are those detailed by Fredson Bowers in his article, 'The Transcription of Manuscripts: The Record of Variants', SB , 29 (1976), 212-264, and exemplified in his apparatus for the definitive ACLS-Harvard edition of William James's Works (1975- ). For ease in comparing the variant readings, as many alterations in the manuscripts as possible have been included in the list of variants. An ampersand for 'and', 'ye' for 'the', and abbreviations for 'which', 'should', and 'could' have not been considered variants; but where a variant in word, phrase, or line in a manuscript involves such a convention or abbreviation, it is reproduced as written. The number introducing each recorded variant is the line number of the Eversley Edition (and Ricks, pp. 1206-1217). Numbers separated by a slanting stroke, for example 50/51, indicate a line or lines, as the case may be, that existed in an antecedent text but not in Eversley. The lemma—the reading to the left of the bracket—is that of the authoritative text. The rejected variants follow in chronological order to the right of the bracket. If the sigil—the symbol for one of the collated texts listed above—does not appear to the right of the bracket, the reading in that state of the text is the same as that of Eversley, except for the passages and the final page that are lacking in MS 1 and P 4 respectively. To warn of this exception, the inclusive lines are recorded in the proper sequence numerically as lacking . Also in P 1 the beginning word that has been torn away in lines 1 and 2 is so designated. Readings resulting from AT's, George Grove's, or Richard Clay's alterations of the printed text in proofs are distinguished by AT, G, or C and a slanting stroke before the proof number (i.e., AT/P 1 , G/P 4 , C/P 4 , for example). On P 2 , where the poet, after correcting the Oread passage extensively, then deleted it and inserted the bowdlerized version, the two stages of alteration have been designated AT 1 and AT 2 . When autograph alterations of the printed text result in the reading of the authoritative text (as they do in many instances), the sigil is placed out of chronological order immediately to the right of the bracket for emphasis and to save space. The alteration is easily understood by comparing the printed variant in the designated proof with the lemma. In some instances, the reading of the lemma existed early in a manuscript(s), became altered (deliberately or through error in copying or typesetting), and then was reverted to. For clarity in these circumstances, the sigil or sigils for the text in which the early reading is the same as the lemma is shown chronologically immediately to the right of the bracket and before the symbol for AT's or another's alteration of a printed text or before any variant reading if (as in a few cases) the return to the original reading is not the result of proofreading marks on one of the extant proofs. Since AT added lines extensively to the poem through the first stages of page proof (and there were occasional errors of omission), a number of words or lines do not exist in the complete passages of MS 1 and in MS 2 , MS 3 , P 1 , P 2 and P 3 ; and the full lines on the Oread are of course omitted in P 5 (alt.), P 6 , and M. Such words or lines are accounted for by omit , followed by the appropriate sigil. A superscript 1 or 2 is used to identify one or the other of two identical words in the same line. A vertical stroke | indicates the ending of a line. A sigil, a dash, and another sigil (for example, MS 1 -P 1 ) are used as a means of saving space to signify that a variant reading exists in MS 1 and all subsequent states in which the line appears through the Lincoln galley proof (i.e., MS 1 , MS 2 , MS 3 , and P 1 ). Two arbitrary symbols have been employed in this Historical Collation: the section mark (§) and the double dagger (‡). The section mark indicates that the variant involves wholly or in part an alteration in a MS, the description of which does not appear in the Alterations in the Manuscripts and has been included instead in the Historical Collation. The double dagger indicates that the variant in the MS is part of an alteration not easily transferable to the Historical Collation, the details of which can be found in the Alterations in the Manuscripts. When alterations in the MSS are included in the Historical Collation, the processes of revision are described in square brackets. The quoted text outside a revision in brackets is always the final version in a corrected MS. When no words precede the description of an alteration in a MS, the description applies to the lemma. Some readings are reproduced formulaically. In order to specify the words in the text which are affected by the description in square brackets, an asterisk (*) appears before the first word to which the description in square brackets applies. When there is no asterisk, the description in square brackets applies to all the words of a reading preceding the brackets, or the affected word or words are within the square brackets along with the description—usually the record of a deletion. In descriptions of alterations in the MSS, over means a correction by writing over a letter(s) of a word on the original line; interlined (abbreviated intrl. ) means added between lines. Above ( ab. ) positions an interlineation with respect to a word or words in a line which are usually deleted but sometimes are not actually crossed out ( del. and undel. ). Inserted ( insrt. ) refers to an addition in the margin or on the verso of a facing leaf. No distinction has been made between interlineations and insertions made with or without a caret or a guideline. In order to focus upon the alteration achieved rather than the means of achieving it, the general description altered from ( alt. fr. ) has been used frequently. Other abbreviations are as follows: aft. for after , bef. for before, bel. for below , transpd. for transposed , sg. qt. for single quote , and questn. mk. for question mark .

      <field name="fulltext">ALTERATIONS IN THE MANUSCRIPTS All alterations in manuscripts made during the course of writing and of revision that have not previously been shown in the Historical Collation are recorded here. The medium is black ink, except for a few revisions in blue ink by AT in MS 3 . The lemmata—readings to the left of the bracket—are those of the Eversley Edition and ordinarily represent agreement of book and manuscript. To permit condensed entries, however, in a few instances a single dagger (†) prefixed to the line reference warns the user to refer to the Historical Collation for the exact manuscript reading when it is not precisely that of the lemma or has not been specified in the descriptive part of the entry. The use of three dots in quoted descriptions to the right of the bracket indicates ellipsis rather than the existence of dots in a manuscript. Otherwise, all entries follow the bibliographical rule that material within single quotes is cited exactly as it appears in the original document.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 "A Note on the Variants of In Memoriam and Lucretius ," The Library , 5th ser., 8 (1953), 269-273; "Tennyson's Lucretius ," The Library , 5th ser., 20 (1965), 63-64. 2 Letters to Macmillan (1967), pp. 112-114. Just when Grove, who for some time had assisted David Masson, the founding editor of Macmillan's Magazine , actually succeeded him has been variously dated from 1867 to May, 1868 (see under Masson, DNB , 2nd supplement [1912], II, 583; Charles L. Graves, The Life and Letters of Alexander Macmillan [1910], p. 280; and Graves, The Life and Letters of Sir George Grove [1903], p. 156). Professor William E. Buckler argues from Masson's name's appearing as editor on volume 17 (which ends with the number for April, 1868) that he had the "decisive judgement" in the expurgation of the Oread ("Tennyson's Lucretius Bowdlerized?" RES , NS, 5 [1954], 269, n.8). In fact, on December 20, 1867, Macmillan wrote Masson to terminate his editorship. Although the publisher found the necessity of doing so "very painful," Masson's absence in Scotland (he had been elected Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature in the University of Edinburgh in 1865) made it increasingly difficult to conduct the magazine. Macmillan proposed to keep Masson on a £100 yearly retainer, in return for which he would write four or five articles. If they reached more than 50 pages, he would be paid by the page, at the rate of £2 a page for the overage. His name would be retained as editor to the end of the volume, and no one else's would then appear, though Grove would take over the editorial duties. Macmillan expressed his hope that Masson would continue a friendly interest in the magazine and would be willing from time to time to give opinions on articles and make suggestions when called upon (British Library, Add. MSS. 55842, fols. 90-92 v ; since all references hereafter to Add. MSS. are to letters in the archives of Macmillan and Co. in the British Library, I do not repeat their location in succeeding documentation). Although Masson's reply does not appear in the Macmillan files, he seems to have acceded to these terms. The correspondence shows that by Jan. 13, he sent Macmillan a mass of articles which he had been holding, and that Grove had the editorial authority to decide upon the contents of the February issue (Add. MSS. 55387 (2), fol. 880). In a letter of Feb. 3, 1868, to Edmund Lushington (see below), Macmillan refers to Grove as having "just taken the Editorship." There can be no question, as the present article demonstrates, that Grove was editorially responsible for "Lucretius" from beginning to end. 3 For permission to print from autograph material, I am indebted to the Lord Tennyson, Mr. W. S. G. Macmillan, Macmillan Administration (London and Basingstoke) Ltd., the Master and Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, and the authorities of the British Library, the Tennyson Research Centre Collection, the Lincolnshire Library Service, Harvard University, the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, the New York Public Library, the Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations, the University of Virginia, Wellesley College, and Yale University. 4 Hallam Tennyson, Alfred Lord Tennyson: A Memoir by His Son (1897), II, 28; hereafter cited as Memoir . 5 Alfred Tennyson (1949), p. 374. See also Memoir , II, 62. 6 Sir Charles says that Good Words "gave no less than £700 for The Victim " ( Tennyson , p. 374). See below for the financial arrangements with Macmillan's . 7 Grove first met Tennyson in 1854, when, with a letter of introduction from his brother-in-law, George Granville Bradley (afterwards Dean of Westminster), he went to Farringford, as Secretary of the Crystal Palace, to seek an inaugural ode on the re-opening of the Palace at Sydenham. He was unsuccessful in his mission; but the poet received him cordially, and the "result . . . was the beginning of a truly delightful and valuable friendship . . ." (Graves, Grove , p. 45). At the end of 1867, Macmillan also enjoyed a cordial relationship with Tennyson of over eight years' standing. Since the publication of Poems , 1842, he had been a keen admirer of the poet, whom he met, according to Sir Charles, in Cambridge some time in September, 1859 ( Tennyson , p. 320; see also Memoir , I, 442). The two were soon quite at ease with one another (see Macmillan's letter to James MacLehose in Graves, Macmillan , pp. 133-134). In launching Macmillan's Magazine , the publisher and Masson spent "'three glorious days with Tennyson' in the Isle of Wight" and received the promise of "Sea Dreams," which appeared in the second issue of the magazine, 1 (December, 1859), 191-198 (Charles Morgan, The House of Macmillan ( 1843-1943 ) [1943], p. 57). In the same issue (1, 114-115), Macmillan, under his pseudonym "Amos Yates," made a spirited defense of Maud in response to Gladstone's derogatory comments on that poem in his review article of the first four Idylls of the King , published in the Quarterly Review , 106 (1859), 454-485. In the early 60's, Tennyson was a frequenter of Macmillan's celebrated Tobacco Parliaments at 23 Henrietta St., Covent Garden. See Graves, Macmillan , p. 151, and Morgan, pp. 50-53. 8 In printing letters, I observe exactly the orthography and punctuation (or lack of it) in the original (or in the printed text, when the MS original is not available) with the following exceptions: I use double quotation marks for all quotations and titles in quotation marks, regularly indent paragraphs, put postscripts at the end of letters (regardless of where they actually appear), separate the "A" and the "T" of "Tennyson," which the poet often wrote together in his signature, and omit the underlining or partial underlining that sometimes occurs as a terminal flourish under Macmillan's signature. To save space, I put the letterheading address on a single line and do not reproduce publishers' full printed or embossed letterheads. The texts of Macmillan's outgoing letters derive from transcripts in his letter books. From the handwriting, it appears that in 1867-68 one or the other of two clerks in his office copied into the letter book each letter before it was posted. The paper of the letter books if of poor quality, and in some instance the ink has run and blurred badly. 9 The amounts paid for each poem, here first published, were omitted when the letter was printed in Letters of Alexander Macmillan , ed. George A. Macmillan (1908), pp. 236-237. 10 I have been unable to verify the text of the first reading, since the MS apparently has not survived in the Macmillan archives. 11 The poem is a variant version of "A voice spake out of the skies," finally published in The Death of Oenone, Akbar's Dream, and Other Poems (1892). See The Poems of Tennyson , ed. Christopher Ricks (1969), p. 1193. There is no reference to these lines in the Macmillan-Grove correspondence. Perhaps, since they did not publish the poem, they felt it so slight as to detract from the impact of "Wages," which they regarded highly. In addition to their remarks about "Wages" quoted above, Macmillan declared to Grove, "Tennysons poem is grand. I wish someone could write a commentary on it" (Add. MSS. 55387(2), fol. 880 [Jan. 13, 1868]). Despite the willingness expressed here to accede to Macmillan's preference for the first reading, Tennyson soon decided that "flying by" was the better one, and the text in Macmillan's followed his judgment. 12 The "Büchner" to which Macmillan refers is Louis Büchner, Force and Matter: Emperico-Philosophical Studies, Intelligently Rendered , ed. J. Frederick Collingwood (1864), an English translation of Friedrich Carl Christian Ludwig Büchner's Kraft und Stoff . This copy of Büchner is in the poet's library at the Tennyson Research Centre ( Tennyson in Lincoln , comp. by Nancie Campbell [1971], I, 36, No. 654). 13 This undated letter, which is in the Berg Collection, New York Public Library, is misdated "February" in Letters to Macmillan , p. 112. 14 For a bibliographical description of this MS and the other MSS and proofs compared in this article, see the Bibliographical Note below. Although Paden asserts that this MS is not in Tennyson's wife's hand (p. 269, n.3), there can be no doubt that it is in her autograph, and the evidence of Tennyson's letter above is conclusive. 15 Since the notice does not seem to have appeared, Dasent may have refused it; but the likelihood is that, in view of Tennyson's distress over the advertisements of the poems which were published in Good Words and Once a Week , Grove never offered the announcement, or that if he did, he withdrew it. 16 After 1864, J. Bertrand Payne was manager of Edward Moxon &amp; Co., the firm that had published Tennyson since 1832. See Harold G. Merriam, Edward Moxon: Publisher of Poets (1939), p. 194. 17 In addition to Alexander Strahan, previously identified as the publisher of Good Words , the persons to whom the letter refers are Eneas Sweetland Dallas, editor of Once a Week ; Edmund Lushington, Tennyson's brother-in-law and a professor of Greek at the University of Glasgow; James T. Knowles, the architect of Aldworth, editor of the Contemporary Review and later of the Nineteenth Century ; and Thomas Woolner, the sculptor. 18 The asterisk indicates that the word or words following it are the reading to which the description in square brackets applies. See F. Bowers, "Transcription of Manuscripts: The Record of Variants," Studies in Bibliography , 29 (1976), 212-264. 19 Line references in parentheses refer to the authoritative text in the Eversley Edition: The Works of Tennyson , annotated Alfred Tennyson, ed. Hallam Tennyson, 9 vols. (1907; rpt. 1908), II, 198-209. 20 It is possible that one of the fifteen, "heart" changed from "breast" (240), may not be an actual miscopying on Emily Tennyson's part but an alteration that the poet introduced in correcting MS 3 and simultaneously made on MS 2 . 21 This line continued to cause the poet difficulty, as his corrections on the page proofs reveal. After returning to the reading of MS 2 , he finally perceived before "Lucretius" was published that not the carelessness of the gods was what needed emphasis but, in view of their heedlessness of man, Lucretius' recognition of the irrationality and philosophical contradiction of his actually imploring them. And thus Tennyson reached the final reading, "I know you careless, yet, behold, to you". 22 See Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., and Christopher Ricks, "A Further History of Tennyson's Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington : the Manuscript at Trinity College, Cambridge, and the Galley Proof at Lincoln," SB , 32 (1979), 125-157. 23 According to Hallam Tennyson's note in the Eversley Edition (II, 362-363), the change to "neat-herds" resulted from a suggestion by the classical scholar, Hugh A. J. Munro, whose edition and translation of De Rerum Natura was published in 1864 ( T. Lucreti Cari de Rerum Natura Libri Sex, with a Translation and Notes , 2 vols.). 24 This reading is a reversion to the line as originally written in MS 2 and MS 3 . 25 In an unpublished portion of a letter at Harvard to Benjamin Paul Blood, May 7, 1874, Tennyson wrote that "What is duty?" "was altered because Lucretius nowhere I think makes any mention of Duty in that sense. . . ." But the Laureate returned to the idea and the expression and even intensified it in the final version of the line in The Holy Grail volume (see below). 26 From the textual evidence, one must conclude that Tennyson did not return P 2 to Grove or to Macmillan. Although its possession by a descendant of Alexander Macmillan may seem to suggest the contrary, the present owner's grandmother was a daughter of Sir John Simeon, Tennyson's neighbor and intimate friend on the Isle of Wight, and was the poet's goddaughter (see a letter from Mr. W. S. G. Macmillan to Sir Charles Tennyson, April 4, 1966, in the Tennyson Research Centre). Either she or her father likely received it as a memento from the author. 27 Several of these were added in later proofs, and a few never entered the text. 28 Ricks is quite right in asserting that this letter, though it is now physically with P 2 , cannot refer to that proof; and without the evidence of P 3 , his surmise that the letter applied to an anterior proof was a reasonable one ( The Library , pp. 63-64). 29 I have disregarded the uncorrected duplicate in numbering the proofs leading to the text in Macmillan's but have described it in the Bibliographical Note. Two copies of the slip containing the alternate version of the Oread passage accompany this proof and have not been tipped in. 30 When Nowell-Smith printed this letter from the Berg Collection, he omitted the address, which is in black embossed letters ( Letters to Macmillan , p. 114). The date is in Emily Tennyson's hand in slightly different ink from the body of the letter. She wrote "March" over her "Feb" false start. Although Masson's preference on critical grounds for the short form of the Oread may have reinforced Grove's and Macmillan's judgment, he too was aware, as he put the matter, "of what that blatant beast, the public, might say about the longer form of the passage" (see Buckler, pp. 269-270); and Ricks is certainly correct that the decision to use the alternative reading was made on grounds of squeamishness ( The Library , p. 64). Malcolm Macmillan says that Charles Kingsley remonstrated with the poet "about some descriptive lines as being too warm, and tending to revive the fashion of the lesser Elizabethan dramatists," and that as a consequence they were excised ( Selected Letters of Malcolm Kingsley Macmillan [1893], p. 291). This notion is manifestly in error, as is Thomas J. Wise's contention that Tennyson cancelled the full passage because of Robert Buchanan's article, "The Fleshly School of Poetry," in the Contemporary Review for October, 1871 (see Paden, p. 271, n. 3). 31 Although the text in Every Saturday also shows the commas after "wilderness," (204) and "hour," (258) that Tennyson added on P 5 , it fails to reflect a semicolon for a comma at the end of line 132 and commas for semicolons in "A satyr, a satyr," (192), which he also introduced in that proof. All three of these accidentals in Every Saturday conform to the uncorrected text of P 4 . 32 Besides these three and the three cited in the previous note, the other ten instances in which the text in Every Saturday agrees with P 4 and not with P 5 as corrected are the following: "Storm and what dreams ye holy gods, what dreams," for "Storm, and what dreams, ye holy Gods, what dreams!" (33), "Cadmeän" for "Cadmean" (50), "direct" for "direct," (62), "scorn" for "scorn," (77), "wish" for "wish—" (205), "life—" for "life." (218), and "will" for "will," (220). Every Saturday followed American practice in spelling ("philter", "labor", "havoc", "neighbors") and expanded all Tennyson's elisions, as in "thro'" and in the endings of past participles. Its text also varies from either proof in having a semicolon instead of a comma after "spit" (132) and a comma instead of a semicolon after "I" (235)—punctuation that may be deliberate but that more likely represents lapses by the American compositor. His "impurpled" for "empurpled" (135) is an accepted variant spelling, but "Beccause" (68) and "Gods." instead of "Gods," (92) are both typographical errors. Regrettably, no proof of "Lucretius" seems to be extant in the records of Houghton Mifflin Co., the successors of Ticknor and Fields, which are now in the Houghton Library at Harvard. I am indebted for this information to Mr. Patrick Miehe, the cataloger of these archives. 33 There is an uncorrected proof copy of "Lucretius" in the Beinecke Library at Yale University that has the period after the title. Since the text in substantives and accidentals (except for a missing exclamation mark at the end of 1. 279) is identical with that printed in Macmillan's , I have disregarded this state in the Historical Collation; but I have provided a complete description of it in the Bibliographical Note. 34 The poem by James Russell Lowell was "A June Idyl," which Macmillan's did not publish. 35 The Pall Mall Gazette for April 29 was the 1000th number of the paper, a milestone that the publisher and the editor celebrated with a dinner for the literary staff at the Garrick Club (see J. W. Robertson Scott, The Story of the Pall Mall Gazette [1950], pp. 175-176). Greenwood, along with John Morley, Robert Browning, Matthew Arnold, Tom Hughes, Thomas Huxley, Henry Sidgwick, and Sir Arthur Helps, was a guest at an All Fools' Day dinner given by Macmillan on April 1, 1868 (Scott, pp. 183-184). No doubt personal relationships played a part in the favorable advance coverage from the Pall Mall Gazette . 36 On Dec. 29, 1865, Macmillan wrote to Gladstone, "The Spectator . . . is perhaps the ablest and most influential of the weeklies" (Graves, Macmillan , p. 243). See also William B. Thomas, The Story of The Spectator, 1828-1928 (1928). 37 The Illustrated Times expressed the hope of "giving a few words of special notice next week" to "Lucretius" but failed to do so until May 30. By that time the poem had been "so fully criticised" by other journals, the Illustrated Times said, that it merely remarked upon the work's exhibiting "at least one example of every mannerism of the poet" and upon its remarkable "individuality of style" (12, 398). 38 Richard Claverhouse Jebb, later Regius Professor of Greek and one of the most distinguished scholars of his epoch, was at this time a brilliant young Classics don at Trinity College, Cambridge. Himself an "Apostle," he had met Tennyson in the previous year at a dinner party given at the Master's Lodge by the poet's college friend, William Hepworth Thompson, then the Master of Trinity (Caroline Jebb, The Life and Letters of Sir Richard Claverhouse Jebb [1907], pp. 93-94). Their acquaintance flowered in a friendship of mutual respect and regard; and in 1889 Tennyson prefaced "Demeter and Persephone" in Demeter and Other Poems with an introductory poem to Jebb. Whether Jebb's article on the historical accuracy of Tennyson's characterization of Lucretius, scheduled for publication in Macmillan's for June, was invited by Macmillan or initiated by Jebb, it seems probably to have stemmed from the reviewer in the Pall Mall Gazette , who asserted the correspondence of Tennyson's Lucretius with his Roman original but disclaimed having the space—"in a little journal like ours"—to elaborate the point. Just the thing, however, for a "scholarly" magazine like Macmillan's ; and the publisher was not one to miss such an opportunity. Writing to Jebb on May 1, he inquired, "Have you done anything to your Article on Lucretius yet? We will gladly put it into type and let you make what alterations you care in it" (Add. MSS. 55388(1), fol. 312). By May 7, Jebb had sent the MS, and Macmillan assured him that he should "have proof in good time for correcting" (fol. 325). On May 12, the piece was in type; and Macmillan wrote, after seeing the first proof, urging Jebb to mention Matthew Arnold by name in his comparison of Empedocles and Lucretius (fol. 344)—a suggestion that Jebb followed. The reference to Clapham is apparently to James Knowles's house, The Hollies, Clapham Common. 39 The Nation , an American journal, published in New York, damned with faint praise: "'Lucretius' . . . seems tolerably successful. . . . Of the general situation the pathos is well enough set forth; not too well; not so well that the poem is at all a great one, or more than a clever, learned, well-finished one" (6 [April 30], 352-353). For this reviewer bringing in Lucilia at the conclusion saved the poem "from being quite a dull one," and he wished that Tennyson had made more of the protagonist's discovery at the end that he was the "victim really of a foolish woman and a vile drug." A single line that the Nation mentioned as metrically objectionable was one of those resulting from the compositor's errors, "And tickling the brute within the man's brain" (21). The Cosmopolitan (1865-76) was a weekly paper of news, politics, commerce, literature, art, and society, published on Saturday. No copy for May 2 or May 9 exists in British or American libraries. 40 The History of The Times: the Tradition Established, 1841-1884 (1939) identifies Dallas as the author (p. 483). 41 "A riotous confluence of water courses", "Ruining along the illimitable inane," "Hired animalisms, vile as those that made", and "All-seeing Hyperion—what you will—". 42 See his letter, March 2, 1868, above. Nearly a half-century ago, E. A. Osborne described a set of page proof for the Holy Grail volume, then belonging to Mr. W. A. Foyle, in which Tennyson had not yet altered the Oread passage and the last line of the poem from the readings in Macmillan's ( TLS , August 25, 1932, p. 596). 43 There were twenty-nine alterations in accidentals from the text in Macmillan's to that in the Holy Grail volume (sixteen of them had to do with quotation marks) and ten such variations between the Holy Grail and Eversley. (See Paden for a few variants in intermediary editions between the Holy Grail and Eversley, [pp. 271-272].) "That", which was the original reading, stood until Tennyson changed it to "And" in P 2 and P 3 , when he inserted line 260. Ricks considers "That" in Eversley to be a mistake ( The Poems of Tennyson , p. 1217); and in the one-volume Macmillan edition (1913) that Hallam Tennyson edited and that incorporates the author's notes from Eversley, the text reverts to "And" (p. 164). In my textual comparisons I have, of course, disregarded Thomas J. Wise's forgery, which he described in A Bibliography of the Writings of Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1908), I, 191-192, and in The Ashley Library: A Catalogue of Printed Books, Manuscripts, and Autograph Letters Collected by Thomas James Wise (1925), VII, 129. John Carter and Graham Pollard documented this alleged state as spurious in An Inquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets (1934), pp. 305-306.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Verdict on GW 2182 and 2183 by Dennis E. Rhodes</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke under its nos. 2182 and 2183 describes two editions of the Sermones quadragesimales et de sanctis , commonly called Flos florum , which at the time of printing was attributed to the pen of St. Antoninus Archbishop of Florence (1389-1459), but which is really the work of the Dominican Gabriel of Barletta (died 1470). There was evidently no other edition in the early period. The first (GW 2182 = Hain 1241) has 380 leaves, with two columns and 36 lines to a column, and is printed in types 1 and 2 according to the GW's classification. The second (GW 2183 = Hain 1240) has 332 leaves, with two columns and 40 lines to a column, and is in types 2 and 3 of the same press, which the GW thinks may have been located in Milan, possibly after 1500. Although only the first of these editions is in the British Library and I have not yet seen a copy of the second, it is obvious that both editions were printed by the same press, since they share in common one of their types. (Thanks to the courtesy of Mr. G. A. Dart, County Librarian, I have obtained xerox copies of a few pages of GW. 2183, the only example of which recorded in the British Isles being that in Cardiff Public Library. From these it is quite clear that the two editions are indeed products of the same press. Not only do the types agree, but the same woodcut capital R appears in both editions.) B.M.C. (pt. vii, p. 1126), in describing the British Museum's copy of the first edition (IA. 36991) under paragraph 8 of 'books printed in Italy in types not assignable to any town', remarks that 'the place of printing may be Milan or Venice', but that Proctor had catalogued the book 'among the Venetian adespota (no. 5719) with the note 'after 1500?''. The two types of GW 2182 are 100G., large text and heading type 'of Veneto-Milanese pattern', and 73G., text-type; and it is further noted that these types both resemble those of Pachel at Milan, although 73G. is 'closely akin to De Luere (Venice) 74G. (1500) but not the same'. The time has now come to identify this press once and for all; and in fact it is not difficult to do so. The answer is, not surprisingly, that the two books were both printed at Venice in the sixteenth century, and, as I shall endeavour to prove, between about 1507 and 1515. When once we know the identity of the printer, we may surmise that his own Milanese origin (which he proclaims in almost every colophon of his that I have seen) may well have something to do with any resemblance to Milanese patterns there may be in his type-faces; but of the fact that these two books were printed at Venice there can be no doubt, since the printer worked there and nowhere else between 1500 and 1521. We must now prove who he was. The text-type, 73G., is exactly the same, with its characteristically small capitals A and P, its double-barred H and N, and strange G, as the 73G. used in Girolamo di Manfredi, Il perchè , printed 'ad instantia de Zorzi di Rusconi Milanese' (but certainly in his own office) in Venice on 16 June 1507. 1 This Manfredi also employs type 100G., the only book in the British Library collections to do so. The two books (that is, the Manfredi and the Sermones Flos florum , GW 2182) also contain copious examples of a set of florid and ornate lombard capitals, many of which also appear in La vita de Merlino , printed by Giorgio Rusconi on 20 April 1507 (Isaac 13083). GW 2182 contains five woodcut capital letters (E, F, I, Q and R) belonging to at least three different alphabets. The capital E on sig. SS2 v of the Antoninus appears, with the same cracks in much the same state, on leaf 2 v of Le cose volgari by Giovanni Bruni, signed by Rusconi on 18 October 1506 (Isaac 13031). Thereafter, as far as I have been able to check in the British Library's collection of Rusconi books, it is not used again until we find it, in a much more worn and battered state, on sig. b1 r of Montalboddo Fracan, Paesi nouamente ritrouati per nauigatione di Spagna in Calicut, etc. , printed by Rusconi on 18 August 1517 (Isaac 13065); and then again on sigs. a5 r and P1 r of the Cicero, Epistolae familiares , of 20 March 1519 (Isaac 13076). A capital F, 29 x 26 mm., with the figure of a cat (or is it a lion?), is on sig. z2 v of GW 2182, and we find it again no less than seven times in the same Cicero of 20 March 1519. The base of the letter is cunningly made by the woodcutter to serve as the cat's tail, and so it is amusing to observe that the printer can use the same letter either as an E (six times in the Cicero) or as an F (once in the Cicero, as in the Antoninus). The edition of Fracan mentioned above has on sig. i3 r a capital I of a smaller alphabet, much broken in the lower left-hand side of the frameline; and it occurs twice in the Ovid, Metamorphoses , of 20 April 1517 (Isaac 13062). This I is first found, unbroken, on sig T1 r and on GG1 r of the Antoninus. A small and rather undistinguished Q, 22 mm. square, on sig. HH8 v of the Antoninus, is used again on A2 r (where it is much more worn) of Vocabularium iuris , printed on 14 August 1517 (Isaac 13064). It is also found frequently in the Italian Bible of 2 March 1517 (Isaac 13059). Only one capital, a letter R measuring 23 mm. square, with flowers, which we find on sig. A3 r of the Antoninus, and which apparently belongs to the same alphabet as the I, has not yet been traced in any other book in the British Library. But now we have overwhelming evidence to show that the woodcut capitals all belonged to Giorgio Rusconi, who used them over a fairly long period (from about 1506 to about 1520), and that he must have printed GW 2182 towards the beginning of this period, that is about 1506 or 1507. GW 2183 probably came a few years later, about 1510-12. As the second edition has 48 leaves fewer than the first, and as a printer's aim in producing a new edition was often to save paper and space, perhaps the correct order really is: GW 2182 first and GW 2183 second. Georgius de Rusconibus, like all other major Venetian printers of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, printed a certain number of works anonymously. I have already in these pages showed that he must be the printer of the Exempla of Marcus Antonius Coccius (Sabellicus) in September 1507. 2 There seems to be no good reason why some harmless texts were printed without imprint or colophon. It was no doubt partly through sheer thoughtlessness that a printer could often omit such information. GW 2182 has now been removed from the British Library's collection of incunabula, and consequently paragraph 8 at the end of B.M.C. Italy, 'Books printed in types not assignable to any town', is to be abolished, since we know that Giorgio Rusconi printed this book in Venice about 1507. 3</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Establishing Shakespeare's Text: Poins and Peto in 1 Henry IV by Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Unless the edition is like the New Arden with a selection of textual notes, readers of 1 Henry IV in modernized texts will be unaware of a problem of staging that involves Poins and Peto. The facts are these. In Act I, scene ii, Poins reports to Hal and Falstaff that travellers are to come by Gadshill. After persuading Hal to join the hoax on Falstaff, he makes his exit, whereupon the scene concludes with Hal's 'I know you all' soliloquy. In II.ii the disguised Poins and Hal attack Falstaff and the others and secure the booty. Back at the tavern, in II.iv Poins joins Hal first in ragging Francis the drawer and then in exposing Falstaff. On the arrival of the Sheriff, Hal orders Falstaff to conceal himself behind the arras and 'the rest [to] walke up above.' In the Quarto there is no exit direction for anyone, although the Folio (with whatever authority it may possess) supplies the required but uninformative ' Exit .' The Prince and the Sheriff discuss Falstaff and the robbery in guarded terms. Upon the Sheriff's exit the Prince's next line is 'This oylie rascall is knowne as well as Poules' and he orders 'goe call him forth.' In Quarto and in Folio it is not Poins but Peto who responds by drawing the arras and ejaculating, 'Falstalffe: fast a sleepe behind the Arras, and snorting like a horse.' As they search Falstaff, Peto answers the Prince's question of what he has found: 'Nothing but papers my Lord.' The Prince reads off the list of Falstaff's expenditures, ending with the meager halfpenny for bread. He announces: 'ile to the court in the morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place shal be honorable'; and after proposing a charge of foot soldiers for Falstaff he concludes, 'bee with me betimes in the morning, and so good morrow Peto.' As the exeunt line Peto answers, 'Good morrow good my Lord.' This scene poses a difficulty, for without motivation Peto has been silently abstracted from Falstaff's party, with whom he entered, and appointed Hal's servant as a substitute for the attendant and part-companion, Poins. In staging, the dialogue forces us to take it that Poins joins Bardolph and Gadshill in the unnoted exeunt before the Sheriff's arrival but, inexplicably and with no prior arrangement or command, Peto stays with the Prince in his place. Moreover, upon his exit, Poins disappears from the play although he should have appeared in III.iii. Some editors have considered that there has been compositorial confusion here owing to the Quarto abbreviated speech-prefix Po. for Poins that could have been misread as Pe. , and these have followed Dr. Johnson by emending to remove Peto and to re-install Poins as the Prince's companion at the end of the scene, this requiring a stage-direction that includes Peto in the general exit before the Sheriff's arrival. Nevertheless, whatever one may think of the emendation, compositorial confusion is unlikely to have extended to the name Peto in the Prince's farewell. 1 The switch in the roles begun in the Quarto at the end of II.iv is continued in Act III, scene iii, opening with Falstaff, Bardolph, and then the Hostess in the tavern, these being joined by Hal in the following stage-direction: ' Enter the prince marching, and Falstalffe meetes him playing upon his trunchion like a fife .' Peto has no speaking part, but it seems clear that he enters with the Prince, even though unmentioned in the stage-directions, 2 for at the scene's close Hal cries, 'Go Peto to horse, to horse, for thou and I | Have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time'. This is the last of Peto on stage, although we hear of him in IV.ii when Falstaff, on the march, orders Bardolph, 'bid my Liuetenant Peto meet me at townes end.' In this second tavern scene III.iii earlier editors once more were likely to substitute Poins for Peto as Hal's companion despite the text, aided by the assumption that Poins fits the metre as in 'Go Poins to horse, to horse' better than Peto. However, the extra weak syllable is by no means so unmetrical as to make this sufficient evidence for a mistake. Indeed, any theory for compositorial or scribal error based on a confusion of speech-prefixes breaks down on the occurrence of the name in the dialogue in two different scenes, the more especially since in III.iii Peto appears in the Quarto neither in stage-direction nor in speech-prefix. Since another explanation must be sought, it behooves an editor to account for the abrupt substitution of Peto for Poins at the end of the first tavern scene, and on the basis of this explanation to decide what he should do in the text: whether to emend to Poins in both scenes, which has not been done since Dyce except for Dover Wilson and Charles Sisson; or to split the ticket with the old Oxford and Kittredge by retaining Peto in II.iv but emending to Poins in Hal's 'to horse, to horse' in III.iii; or to retain Peto in both scenes according to the Quarto and Folio authority, as in Alexander, the New Arden, the New Penguin, and other modern editions like the Pelican and New Riverside. In my opinion this latter has been a course influenced more by an inability to explain the anomaly of the names than by any conviction that the Quarto text offers a basically desirable assignment. So far as I have been able to investigate, a satisfactory explanation for this odd switch in characters has not been offered. I suggest that such an explanation is important: those who emend either in both scenes or, unreasonably, in the second only, have taken it that compositorial or scribal error has somehow occurred, whereas those who decline to emend presumably do so on the ground that even against their better judgment they are following in the Quarto the only evidence they have for Shakespeare's intention. Either school of thought poses its difficulties. I propose a relatively simple theatrical explanation. In Julius Cœsar I think it is now established that Dover Wilson's old guess was right and that the same actor doubled the lean and hungry Cassius and the emaciated sick man Caius Ligarius recruited to the conspiracy by Brutus. 3 As a consequence, it is Ligarius, not Cassius, who waits on Cæsar with the other conspirators to escort him to the Capitol even though Cassius had stated that he would be present; yet it is Cassius who enters with the procession at the Capitol, and Ligarius not only does not appear in this stage-direction but is not mentioned in the assassination. This disruption is readily explained by the doubling, an expedient also reinforced by other evidence which indicates that the part of Ligarius was added in a revision of the text after it had been copied out. What we have in 1 Henry IV , I suggest, is the same situation: because of an assignment of actors decided upon during the early planning for production, or even during rehearsal, the actor of Poins had to be withdrawn before the end of II.iv in order to double the part of another character. The abrupt expedient of attaching Peto to Hal instead of Hal's continuing with Poins can scarcely have resulted from any literary consideration, for nothing occurs in II.iv to lead Hal to shift his favor from the quick-witted Poins to the stupid and cowardly Peto. To follow this favor by elevating such a Falstaffian hanger-on to a place of honor in the wars (implying a rank of officer) though appropriate for Poins is to violate all propriety for Peto. 4 If Poins could not be permitted to finish the scene, the only reason must have been that the actor was to double a role in the very next. The next scene is Act III, scene i, marked by the entrance of Hotspur, Worcester, Mortimer, and Glendower in the opening stage-direction. As a doubled part Hotspur must be excluded because his immediate entrance at the start of II.iii had followed directly after Poins's exit in the Gadshill robbery scene. Worcester is a possibility. The closest that his entrance ever comes to an exit by Poins is at the beginning of I.iii which follows the plans for the robbery in I.ii but with Hal's 'I know you all' soliloquy intervening for twenty-three lines between Poins's exit and Worcester's entrance. This soliloquy might have provided somewhat less time to change costume than the action of discovering Falstaff at the end of II.iv, but it could have been enough if Worcester were the part doubled. 5 However, both Mortimer and Glendower are candidates as well, perhaps more attractive in some respects than Worcester, 6 even though Poins's continued absence in Acts IV and V could be explained by Worcester's important role in that section. But since Peto is not present in these acts either, I think it clear that once the battle is forward the seriousness of the action prevented Hal from carrying along a low-life companion like Peto, or even Poins: such an incongruity would have interfered with Shakespeare's efforts to show that the Prince has detached himself from the tavern milieu and is now committed to the chivalric life. The brief interludes with Falstaff are enough to continue the comic subplot without diminishing Hal's glory. Moreover, it should not be held against either Mortimer or Glendower as a candidate that after III.i they do not again appear in the play, and thus that there is no theatrical reason why Poins should not have replaced Peto in III.iii even if there were reasons why he should have been dropped later. 7 It must be emphasized that once Peto has been assigned as Hal's companion in II.iv after the departure of the Sheriff, Shakespeare was bound to retain him whether or not Poins was physically able to resume his role in III.iii. 8 Evidence is lacking, then, that might point to Worcester or to Mortimer or Glendower as Poins's doubled part, although it must have been one of the three. Nonetheless, once the probability of the hypothesis for doubling is accepted, the two particular consequences that follow are of greater import than the identification of the doubled character. As an example, the recognition of Shakespeare's revision of Julius Cæsar led to a reassessment of the nature of the Folio printer's copy. Greg's generally accepted assumption that it was Shakespeare's own holograph had to make way for the more probable hypothesis—given the characteristics of the text as well as the theatrically motivated revision—that Jaggard's copy was a scribal transcript used for the early stages of rehearsal, or at least for the early planning of the production, before a promptbook had been written up. An intermediate transcript, in short, containing what might have been Shakespeare's own holograph revisions in three and just possibly in four scenes. It follows that if an exchange of roles for Poins and Peto to enable the Poins actor to double another character in III.i were inserted in the manuscript of 1 Henry IV , there could be a tug to forsake Greg's tentative leaning toward a Quarto printed from Shakespeare's papers and to accept as somewhat strengthened Alice Walker's assignment (made on other evidence) of the printer's copy as a non-authorial fair transcript of the foul papers and therefore a predecessor of the promptbook; 9 that is, an intermediate transcript as in the copy for Julius Cœsar . 10 Between the two plays a real distinction must be drawn, however. The doubling of Cassius as Caius Ligarius caused what can be described as a major revision and amplification of one scene and minor revision in another. No such evidence of textual expansion or thematic revision is found in 1 Henry IV , nor is there any evidence for more than minor textual change. In fact, except for the simple substitution of Peto's name for Poins's, no other change may have been made in II.iv. 11 Since Poins was disguised, as was Hal, when they attacked Falstaff and his crew, he could not be identified by the Carrier who accompanied the Sheriff and thus it is natural that in the original version with no mention made he should have stayed with Hal during the encounter, as a necessary attendant. This same action is difficult to account for with Peto, who was identifiable and had not been requested to remain in order to replace a Poins who had no reason to leave. That the substitution creaks in this manner may be an indication that Shakespeare (if it were indeed he who tinkered with this doubling problem) made no effort to motivate the change by rewriting. The case is slightly altered in III.iii. Since in the original version Peto would not have been detached from Falstaff in II.iv, it is reasonable to suppose that he would have accompanied Falstaff's and Bardolph's entrance in III.iii and presumably he need not have been mute even though his part would likely have been smaller than Bardolph's, who was his superior. We may also speculate that in the fun made with the Hostess and Falstaff, Poins would not have been mute but would have joined in as he had in II.iv before he dropped from sight. On the other hand, it is appropriate for Peto, as Hal's attendant, to play the mute, for he has no wit and could take no part in the joke about the ring and so on. Cutting, therefore, seems to have been the procedure in adjusting III.iii to the changed circumstances. If this is so, the editorial problem is somewhat sharpened although the procedures to be adopted still remain similar to those advisable for Julius Cœsar . The exigencies of doubling should have no effect on the production (or reading) of Julius Cœsar as it ought to be performed (or read) without the necessity for doubling. To establish a text of Julius Cœsar that does not include Ligarius in the procession at the Capitol and, though a mute, in the assassination would now be, in my view, the height of pedantry. By the same logic, we must distinguish between 1 Henry IV as Shakespeare originally intended it to be acted and the form in which we find it in the Quarto after the doubling rearrangement of parts had been inserted. Any modern producer who retains Peto instead of restoring Poins as Hal's attendant throughout would be violating the clear intention of the author as he wrote the play without doubling in mind. It follows that, as in Julius Cœsar , an editor should ignore the changes later forced on Shakespeare (or caused by company tinkering) because of a problem in casting, perhaps because of the company's attempt to have each role played by the most appropriate actor (as with Cassius-Ligarius), which would mean that the actor of Poins might have been thought to be peculiarly suited for some other part as well. 12 Dr. Johnson's instincts were sounder than the present-day veneration for a theatrically altered text that violates the propriety of character and of situation as Shakespeare had conceived it. An editor cannot restore the missing lines in III.iii but here and in II.iv he can at least give back to Hal his proper companion Poins, and keep Peto exclusively where he belongs in Part One, that is, as a member of Falstaff's party, to which in fact he reverts in Falstaff's reference (presumably in the original version and never altered to take account of the change in II.iv and III.iii) to "my lieutenant Peto " who is to meet him at town's end when the characters of the comic underplot are on the way to the battle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Note on 2 Henry IV In 2 Henry IV Poins is back as Hal's boon companion in II.ii; and in II.iv he participates in disguise with the Prince in the exposure of Falstaff, a parallel to the Gadshill robbery and then the revelation scene at the tavern in Part One, II.iv. As in the first part he then disappears since there is no longer an appropriate role for him to play with the Prince in the serious military and dynastic action that follows. Bardolph is again established as Falstaff's companion and second in command, but Peto is detached from them and is replaced by the Page, especially in such scenes as II.iv, III.ii, and V.i,iii,v. Peto is apparently in Hal's service, although on less intimate terms than in the revision in III.iii of Part One where the words addressed to him were originally spoken to Poins, presumably without change. Peto's single appearance in Part Two is as a messenger in II.iv when he reports to Hal that the King is at Westminster, that twenty wearied posts from the north have brought news of the rebellion, and that a dozen captains are searching for Falstaff. (These captains are once again mentioned when they knock at the tavern door and Bardolph tells Falstaff of their arrival.) Since on Peto's entrance Hal immediately asks him for the news, it seems clear that Peto is the Prince's servant and that the news of the dozen captains are incidental to his main message and should not connect him with Falstaff. When Hal then leaves for the wars the Quarto notes his exit with Poins ( Exeunt ). The Folio varies by reading simply Exit , but this does not necessarily indicate that in the Folio version Poins was left behind, for a singular exit is not uncommon for a group, as shown by the direction for Falstaff and his companions below. This latter direction consists only of the word Exit in the corrected Quarto, no direction being present in the uncorrected state. Some editors follow Capell in assigning Peto his exit with Hal and Poins, despite the specific direction of the Quarto which lists only Poins. Others give Peto an exit with Bardolph and Falstaff, filling in with names the laconic QF direction. It is possible that Peto leaves the stage (and is not heard from again) after the delivery of his message, a desirable exit that would neatly preserve his slightly ambiguous attachment. (Also, after his hurried journey he might well want food and drink, and would go elsewhere in the tavern to company more suited to his station.) But if, instead, he is to leave with one or other party, the revised version of Part One suggests strongly that his exit should be made with the Prince and Poins. On the example of Poins, Shakespeare need not have felt himself bound in Part Two to observe for Peto the theatrical exigencies that developed in Part One. Thus the substitution of the Page, a superior comic character, as a follower of Falstaff and Bardolph could have been a quite independent development. That Peto has no connection with them in Part Two is indicated significantly in the Quarto direction for Bardolph's entrance to Shallow in III.ii, which reads ' Enter Bardolph and one with him ' (not Peto) whereas the Folio—with whatever doubtful authority it may possess for the staging—substitutes ' Bardolph and his Boy .' Since the Quarto is certainly closer to Shakespeare's papers than the Folio, it can be argued that in this entrance Bardolph in military dress was accompanied by some common soldier as an indication of the approaching wars. That the Page could make his entrance (although not noted) later with Falstaff is possible although there are some objections. 13 We cannot be sure whether the Folio's perhaps inappropriate substitution of the Page for the "one," or common soldier, as first visualized by Shakespeare, was a theatrical economy or an act of supererogation on the part of the scribe who made up the copy that lies behind the Folio. For the matter at hand, it is enough that Shakespeare had an opportunity here to reintroduce Peto as a member of Falstaff's party and that he did not take it. The evidence of 2 Henry IV , therefore, has no direct application to the problem of the original form of Part One in respect to Peto, the more especially since as a sequel it would not have been written before Shakespeare had quite completed Part One 14 and, on the evidence, the company had worked out the casting assignments. It may be said that Shakespeare was desperate for any device to fill out a relatively thin play, the first part of which had to be substantially carried by Falstaff. Hence the earlier scenes involving the Page were more useful in sustaining the comic dialogue (for there is little action) than anything that might have been invented for Peto. Later, when action has evolved, the Page subsides into a mute. That the Page can be justified as an independent creation and substitute for Peto does not imply that Peto's role in Part Two was not influenced by the theatrical revision reflected in the preserved Part One text, for indeed it was. Peto's role as Hal's messenger in Part Two ignores the vestigial anomalous reference to him in Part One IV.ii as Falstaff's lieutenant in the wars, and in placing him as Hal's messenger and never associating him directly with Bardolph or Falstaff Part Two continues Peto's switch to Hal's party that constituted the theatrical revision of Part One. However, since Poins once more is back as Hal's personal attendant, Peto's Part Two role is no more than a token one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 In addition to the unlikelihood of Po. being used as an abbreviation in the text and becoming confused with Pe. , Dr. Peter Davison, the editor of the New Penguin edition, points out that in direct address Hal calls Poins Ned. However, since the speech-prefixes for Peto appear twice before his name comes in the text, it is not probable that a confusion about the name in the Prince's address caused the substitution. Instead, one would need to hypothesize that because of the mistake he had made in the speech-prefixes a conscientious compositor substituted Peto's name for Poins's in Hal's speech. Not only does this require double error by extension, but also it will not explain the appearance of Peto for Poins in III.iii. Thus it is difficult to take seriously any hypothesis that the substitution was created by an error. 2 His absence from the direction for the Prince's entrance need not be significant. Although Bardolph is specified as entering with Falstaff at the start of the scene, the group entrance in II.iv of Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and Gadshill is noted only as ' Enter Falstaffe .' 3 Bowers, "The Copy for Shakespeare's Julius Cœsar," South Atlantic Bulletin , 43 (November 1978), 23-36. 4 Poins seems to be socially and professionally a considerable distance above the hangers-on Bardolph and Peto. His high spirits and superior intelligence make him a suitable companion-attendant to Prince Hal and it is not shocking to contemplate him as a competent officer in the war. (Peto's lieutenancy is Falstaff's creation and is meant to be comic.) Moreover, how Hal's servant Peto, with whom he must ride thirty miles before dinner at the end of III.iii, becomes in IV.ii Falstaff's lieutenant although Hal has not seen Falstaff before this encounter is not to be rationalized. 5 It would be amusing if Shakespearean revision had later inserted this much debated soliloquy in order to provide the necessary time for Poins's change; but of course there is no evidence, Worcester is not necessarily the part doubled, and any such proposition cannot be seriously advanced. Nevertheless, this soliloquy is necessary if the actor of Worcester had doubled as Poins. 6 We know so little about doubling in Shakespeare's company as to be uncertain how much the tradition would allow a switch from Worcester to Poins, back to Worcester, then to Poins, then finally to Worcester instead of the single interlude offered by the part of Mortimer or of Glendower, which would resemble the interlude where Cassius doubles as Ligarius. If one is right in suspecting that the back and forth shuttling was to be avoided, then Glendower may become the prime candidate (see footnote 12 below). 7 If Worcester had doubled as Poins, Worcester's entry at the beginning of IV.i would, of course, have made it impossible for Poins to have left the stage with Hal substantially at the end of III.iii. However, if Poins had made his exit at the command 'to horse, to horse,' there might well have been time for a change of costume. Indeed, the exit of Poins-Peto at this point is preferable to one with Hal after his instructions to Falstaff, if one wants to be scrupulous, since it would be one of the attendant's duties to see that the horses were ready for the journey. The line at which Poins-Peto should exit is an editorial option, for the Quarto is silent. 8 Indeed, a switch back to Poins in III.iii would have emphasized the inexplicable switch to Peto at the end of II.iv. 9 W. W. Greg, The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (2nd ed. 1951), pp. 128-129; Alice Walker, Textual Problems in the First Folio (1953), p. 111. Of course it could have been the promptbook itself, but the characteristics of the Quarto by no means encourage such a speculation. Moreover, that a promptbook would be sent to the printer at this early date in the play's history is most improbable. 10 It must be admitted that the case for an intermediate transcript is not so certain as with Julius Cœsar , for the 1 Henry IV Quarto is much more irregular in respect to such details as the forms of speech-prefixes that were made entirely regular by the scribe in Julius Cœsar . The absence, also, of many necessary exits and of characters in entrances suggests that any fair copy had been pretty much a literal one, attested also by the variant forms of Falstaff's and even of Hal's name. The matter needs further study, especially to test Dr. Walker's impression (for it is little more) that some stiffness in the dialogue associates the Quarto copy with the scribe who prepared the manuscript on which the Folio 2 Henry IV was based. If Shakespeare's manuscript did not require a fair copy before the company could begin to prepare the play for production, then the theatrical alterations could have been made in his working papers and the need for an intermediate transcript between his foul papers and the promptbook would be removed. In this connection, of course, one must consider the revision of the names involving Falstaff and perhaps some rewriting also as a consequence. The matter is obscure and subject chiefly to speculation: the strong evidence for a transcript in Julius Cœsar is wanting in 1 Henry IV even though an overview of the whole situation might well suggest the need. 11 Possibly one other change has been made in the speech-prefix assignments. It is interesting that the direction that follows Hal's order to search Falstaff's pockets reads, ' He searcheth his pocket, and findeth certaine papers .' This he is not the Prince, of course, but Peto. The next lines are: Pr . What hast thou found? Pet . Nothing but papers my Lord. Prin . Lets see what they be, read them. Item a capon 2.s,ii,d. Item sawce iiij,d. etc. The literal interpretation of the Prince's line 'Lets see what they be, read them' would take it not that the Prince reaches out for the papers to examine them himself, but instead that the revelation of what they are will result from Peto's reading them aloud. Yet the lack of a speech-prefix before the inventory and before Hal's subsequent speech, 'O monstrous! . . .' indicates that Hal reads, in contradiction to his order to Peto. Some early editors trusted to the command more than to the lack of speech-prefix and emended to have Poins-Peto read the list. Their instinct may have been sound, for there is no problem whether Poins or the Prince reads. But such a problem could exist were Peto the reader. His speech, we may suppose, was strongly accented. More to the point, even if he were not understood to be illiterate by the audience's perception of his speech and persona, it would scarcely be in character for Peto to read off the list without stumbling and halting and thus to little purpose getting in the way of the comic climax. It is possible, therefore, to speculate that the transfer of the reading of the list from Poins to Hal was made when Peto was substituted in this scene. If so, an editor should restore Poins as the reader. 12 That he might have had a talent for assuming a Welsh accent is a possible speculation, especially since the role of the weak but charming Mortimer requires no special actor. (It seems clear that Cassius doubled Ligarius not because of the shortage of available actors but because of the physique of this one actor.) On the whole, as a pure guess Glendower remains the best bet, and for special reasons. 13 That the Page would be a mute in III.ii is no argument against his presence, given the fact that his importance steadily diminishes after I.ii and II.ii so that he has only two speeches of four and five words respectively in II.iv and is a mute character in V.i,iii,v; nor is the lack of a formal entrance for him with Falstaff any real bar given the fact that he is skipped in V.i in the Quarto, (but not in the Folio) although he is addressed by Shallow and must be present. (This is to assume that the suitable Folio direction in III.ii bringing him on with Bardolph is unauthoritative.) The most serious objection to his appearance in this scene is the contrast with V.i where Shallow first welcomes Falstaff, then Bardolph, and finally the Boy. In III.ii, on the other hand, Shallow greets Bardolph and the "one with him" as "honest gentlemen," an unlikely expression if the Boy were in fact Bardolph's companion as in the Folio. Then, when Falstaff enters (with no indication of a companion in the direction), Shallow welcomes only him, a strong suggestion that the Boy has not entered as well. If we pursue this hint, we may notice that the Boy accompanies Falstaff alone only in I.ii where the Quarto direction describes him as "his page"; in II.i, as "the boy" he comes on with Falstaff and Bardolph; but in II.ii he enters as "boy" with Bardolph and as "Bardolph's boy" also alone with Bardolph in II.iv. There is something in favor of the argument, then, that since he cannot follow Bardolph in III.ii (Q direction and Shallow's form of greeting), it is less likely that an entrance shortly with Falstaff has been inadvertently omitted for a mute character (the Page's apparent transfer to Bardolph once his function as an instigator of wit in Falstaff has been satisfied, and also his omission from Shallow's welcome to Falstaff). Quite properly, the Boy does not appear with Falstaff during the battle in IV.iii, nor does he enter with Bardolph when, the battle over, Falstaff proposes to return through Gloucestershire to revisit Shallow. Nevertheless, the Page is present in V.i when the visit is made: the Boy has not been left behind in London after II.iv while the rest go to the wars. It is a legitimate question, then, why if he is present on the return he was not in the party on the advance. Since speculation is alone possible, no entirely satisfactory answer can perhaps be advanced. Simple inadvertence is always possible here, for Shakespeare must have had his reasons for not bringing him on with Bardolph, and there is some evidence, certainly, in Shallow's greeting, and just possibly in the direction, that he did not accompany Falstaff. In fact, the substitution of the common soldier as Bardolph's companion may be as significant for the Boy as it is for Peto. That is, the Boy has no place in the wars, the audience knows, and to introduce him on the way to battle might have risked a break with the audience's sense of propriety and thus with the illusion of reality. But in peace, there is no risk in his following Falstaff again, though as a mute. It would be a rare audience that would notice the discrepancy, or—if noticing—care. 14 The exact relationship of 2 Henry IV to Part One is much debated but never decided. One school of thought has it that Shakespeare had planned the two parts from the start as a ten-act play. Other critics more realistically believe that the popularity of Part One provoked the sequel, which on the evidence of its single quarto was not markedly popular. A middle ground is suggested by Harold Jenkins in The Structural Problem in Shakespeare's Henry the Fourth (1956). The question is not crucial here, for insofar as the concern is with the Falstaff-Peto-Page equation, it seems clear that the structure of the comic action in 2 Henry IV takes account of the theatrically altered text of Part One and therefore has detached Peto from Falstaff.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Astrological Analysis as an Editorial Tool: The Case of Fletcher's The Bloody Brother by J. C. Eade</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The evidence which an editor brings to bear on a text but which derives from a dictionary or from his own technical knowledge of a subject occupies a middle ground between those kinds we describe as 'external' and 'internal'. Where a text is entirely straightforward, self-explanatory, no 'external' proficiency is required. Where, however, its vocabulary is arcane, we are sometimes required to bring a meaning (or meanings) to the text and examine whether it may be allowed to reside there. Occasionally this process of interaction may produce rather dramatic results: the imported meaning may not merely demand to be accommodated, it may even demonstrate to us that the surroundings themselves need to be changed to accommodate it. Such is the case on three occasions in the extended astrological passage in Act II, sc. iv of John Fletcher's The Bloody Brother . It can be demonstrated that the text has never been printed correctly, and the demonstration relies at least as much upon evidence which is strictly internal as upon knowledge brought to the text from a dictionary. It is, however, only when the importations have been made that one sees precisely where the internal evidence lies—and, indeed, how plentiful that internal evidence is. Editorial and critical treatment of the play has hitherto kept the astrological scene at arm's length. One could be forgiven for having no suspicion at all that the passage was tightly organised and almost entirely respectable, astrologically speaking. It is certainly fiercely technical at first sight, so much so that at one time it was thought that only Ben Jonson could have had the learning to write it, and at another has been dismissed as merely 'bandying back and forth almost every abstruse term in the astrological dictionary'. 1 Examined on its own terms, however, the passage appears very differently. The author's ingenuity may, perhaps, be regarded as dramatically misplaced, since it is impossible to imagine that an audience could have kept pace with him; but it is one thing to regard the passage as close to impenetrable, and very much another to assume from its opaqueness that it must be random nonsense. Indeed, even in its overall contour the passage is astrologically sound, following in their due order exactly those procedures that an astrologer would adopt in reading a horoscope. And it is also internally consistent in a manner which it would have been impossible for the author to achieve without a very secure knowledge of his subject. At one point, for instance, Mars is said to be in 'the selfe same house' as the sun, 'But another signe' (lines 196-197)—a contention that can be verified fully, but only by reference back to lines 165-166 ('the Sunne and Mercury, Mars with the Dragons taile, [in] the third house') and forward to lines 213-214 (' Mars being | . . . in Capricorne '). Such, indeed, are the controls that the passage exerts upon itself that one is able to reconstruct in broad detail the diagram the author must have used to guide his invention. He locates all seven Ptolemaic planets in specific houses, and he specifies further (and independently) which signs of the zodiac four of the planets occupy; then he proceeds to detail (again independently) the angular relationships ('aspects') that three of them have to each other. 2 The opportunities for error and inconsistency in detailing this complex configuration are obviously legion, and yet when properly understood the text can be seen to achieve its aim with some elegance. It has been established that the quartos of the play were set from different manuscripts. 3 Of the two, Cyrus Hoy remarks: 'the authoritative text of the play is, clearly, that of the second quarto' (p. 57). It does, indeed, exhibit a number of superior readings in the astrological passage, but there are three instances where even this text must give way to what may be concluded from a proper understanding of the scene. There is an unavoidable element of technicality involved in explaining why this is so, but fortunately it can be kept within manageable bounds. When the 'cheating Rogues' begin their analysis they start, as an astrologer should, by examining the positions of the planets within the astrological houses, i.e. their position in relation to the heavens as visible at the time of the birth. (Houses 7 to 12 lie above the horizon and houses 1 to 6 lie below it; the 1st and most important house, the ascendant, begins at the eastern horizon.) Having found that the sun, Mercury and Mars are in the third house, Jupiter in the twelfth, and Venus in the second, they continue (in Q1): Saturne in the Fifth, Luna i'th Seventh, and much of Scorpio, Then Mars his Gaudium , rising in th'ascendent, And joyn'd with Libra too . . . (lines 170-173) For this Q2 exhibits: Saturne i'th fift, Luna ith' seaventh, and much of Scorpio , That Mars his gaudium rising in the ascendant, That joint with Libra too . . . I take it that readers of both Q1 and Q2 would assume that 'much of Scorpio ' was in the seventh house with the moon; and that readers of Q2 would consider 'That Mars . . .' and 'That joint . . .' to be epideictic, representing the character's jabbing at the chart. On the surface both texts appear to make sense syntactically, and the meaning of ' gaudium ' might therefore be thought not particularly material. To one who knows what the word does mean, however, and to one who sees how it applies in the context, the lines bear a very different complexion. As is well known, each sign of the zodiac was traditionally allotted to a particular planet as its 'house', or 'mansion'. And for those planets (all except the sun and the moon) which had two signs each, one sign was thought to be preferred, more particularly rejoiced in. This was its gaudium . And it so happens that the gaudium of Mars was Scorpio. If, then, one reads the lines with this minor technicality in mind, one immediately detects a serious anomaly. Since the ascendant (the first house) and the seventh house are diametrically opposite each other, it is impossible that 'much of Scorpio ' could be in the seventh house with the moon and that Scorpio (as Mars' gaudium ) could at the same time be 'rising in the ascendant'. At this point in the development of the scene, then, a reader alert (or alerted) to the anomaly might set it down as an error, either conscious or unconscious. If conscious, then designed for detection and intended to point up the rogues' ignorance; if unconscious, then an indication that the author may have overreached himself by dabbling in astrology. Before the end of the scene, however, the reader will find good internal evidence for impugning the text, not the author, since the scene later refers to Venus as being 'in her exilium , which is Scorpio | And Mars his gaudium ' (lines 217-218). The scene, then, shows us that the author knows Scorpio to be the gaudium of Mars, which suggests that the present passage may well be corrupt. In fact our hint lies in the reading of Q2. Its 'That Mars . . .' need only be emended to 'That's Mars . . .' and one is able to read as follows: . . . and much of Scorpio , That's Mars his gaudium , rising in th'ascendant . . . This emendation cures the anomaly and is supported by a wealth of internal evidence. At first sight, we recall, it appeared that Luna and Scorpio were in the seventh house. But the moon is shortly to be described as being not in Scorpio, but 'in Aries in the seaventh house' (line 187), and Libra (Scorpio's immediate neighbour) is never said to be anywhere but in the first house, and therefore diametrically opposite the seventh. And since, moreover, it is the tail-end of Libra that defines the first house (line 163), it will follow of course that 'much of Scorpio ' should be occupying the remainder of that house. In short, the whole thrust of the passage points to an emendation. Indeed, the choice is either to accept a simple correction that concedes to the author that he knew his subject; or else to persist in upholding an anomaly which would only begin to make sense if we supposed it was designed for detection. And who will say the author's audience was so proficient that it could detect this (supposed) anomaly on the run? Particularly since the anomaly is so oblique that it has never been detected before in the published commentary on the play. The second line that requires correction is in the immediate continuation. The syntax here is extremely flexible, permitting a number of grammatical groupings; but a close inspection of the sense of the lines rapidly closes down the options. In Q1 we find: And Juniu Cœli , Mars his exaltation In the seventh house . . . (lines 174-175) In Q2 we find: And Imum Cœli, Mars his exultation Ith' seaventh house . . . Once again it is firstly the sense which two terms have independently of the text and secondly their function within the lines that defines the problem. Q1's ' Juniu ' is a non-existent word, created by the misreading of minims. ' Imum Cœli ', on the other hand, is the common astrological term for the fourth house (just as 'medium cœli' is the common name for the tenth). A planet's 'exaltation', though, is a particular degree in the zodiac (in the case of Mars it is 28 degrees of Capricorn)—it can never be one of the astrological houses, and for this reason ' Imum ' and 'exultation (properly 'exaltation') should not be used in apposition here. As they stand, therefore, the lines are nonsense: 'the fourth house, the exaltation of Mars, [is] in the seventh house' represents a blatant contradiction in terms. And since no other syntactical grouping yields any better sense here, we must turn, instead, to the contextual function of the lines. At this point in the scene the astrologer is in the process of establishing Mars as 'Lord of the Geniture' (line 177; Q1). This technical process involves determining where among the houses (particularly the primary ones, numbers one, four, seven, and ten) Mars exerts his influence. The process may sound formidable, but the structural pattern in the verse is entirely straightforward. Lines 171-172 locate Mars' gaudium (special mansion) in the first house, and line 175 locates Aries, his other mansion, in the seventh house. These two observations thus specify Mars' relation to two of the primary houses (the ' Cardines ' as the play calls them), and they are quite explicit. Between these two observations lies another, intermediate, observation; and from the very fact that the first observation relates to the first cardin (the first house) and that the third observation relates to the third cardin (the seventh house), we could guess that the intermediate second observation should relate to the second cardin , the fourth house (or 'imum cœli'). To make it do so, we need only take the ' Imum ' of Q2 and emend it to 'In imo ', 4 and the passage makes perfect good sense: . . . Mars his gaudium rising in the ascendant, . . . . . . . And in Imo Cœli , Mars his exaltation, I'th seaventh house, Aries . . . (lines 172, 174-175) With Mars and his 'dignities' occupying three of the four cardins in this way it is no wonder that he is constituted 'Lord of the Geniture'. 5 There is one final point where flexibility of syntax, apparent good sense, and the complications of the subject have led to an entrenched corruption. When the rogues come to examine the planetary aspects they see that . . . Mars out of the selfe same house, (But another signe) here by a platique aspect Looks at the hilage, with a quartile ruling The house where the sunne is . . . (lines 196-199) then they refer shortly afterwards to . . . this same quartile aspect to the Lady of life, Here [in] the seaventh . . . (lines 201-202) Cold on the page this may well appear (like the rest) to be high-flying nonsense. But even a reader entirely at sea and hanging valiantly on to the syntax as a life-line will recognise that the text as it stands states unambiguously that there is 'a quartile [aspect] ruling | The house where the sunne is'. Safe on land, he would regain his bearings and deduce that this house is the third house (lines 165-166). But he would then have time to establish, too, that the sense suggested by the syntax is distinctly awkward for two reasons: in the first place, only planets may rule houses—aspects (quartile or otherwise) never can; and in the second, even if it were possible for a quartile aspect to rule 'The house where the sunne is' (the third house) it could not possibly also be 'this same quartile aspect' which observed the moon 'Here [in] the seaventh'. 6 Once again the technical sense of just one word points the way out of the difficulty. What is the 'hilage' (hyleg)? It is that point of the horoscope which leads to determining the length of the native's life—as the text itself indicates (to those with eyes to see it), when it picks up 'the hilage' by 'the Lady of life'. The connection between the technical term and its gloss is even advertised, one can now see, by the reference to 'this same quartile aspect'. Indeed, once we understand his terminology, we can see that the author is trying hard to make us follow the rationality of his scheme. And the relocation of a single comma will clear up all the difficulties. We should read as follows: Mars Looks at the hilage with a quartile, ruling The house where the sunne is . . . and . . . this same quartile aspect to the Lady of life, Here [in] the seaventh promises some danger . . . 7 (198-199, 201-202) By this simple expedient we again concede to the author control of his subject. The rest of the scene does support the combination that Mars looks at the hilege with a quartile aspect and that he rules the third house; the received text, on the other hand, points merely to wayward nonsense and authorial incompetence. It would be rash to pretend that this astrological outburst is not extremely difficult. But on the other hand, when once we understand how its uncorrupted and undisputed sections work, we may be impressed both by how many clues they contain to the unravelling of the rest, and by the economy with which the author deploys the same pieces of astrological detail in different ways. Mars' aspect to the hyleg , for instance, is first (line 197) described as 'platique' (not yet exact); within a few lines, however, the author has 'the Hyley | . . . by direction come | To a quartile opposition of the place | Where Mars is . . .' (lines 207-210). Now 'direction' is an astrological process whereby future positions are notionally projected on from present ones; here, then, the 'platic' aspect becomes 'partile' (or exact) by the process of 'direction'— but its point of application is also neatly reversed, so that the ' Hyley ' now looks at Mars. Such deftness is a mark of the author's proficiency in his arcane subject. In restoring good sense to the scene we are obliged to bring our understanding of an arcane language to the text, but thereafter the text itself offers checks and correlatives from all sides to confirm our understanding. Paradoxically, it is only when the passage is properly understood that we can see that in fact the author offers us a great deal of assistance and that his scheme locks together in a most satisfying way. Even more importantly though, the interconnectedness inherent in astrological constructs that have a 'rational' base provides us on three occasions with a means of restoring his intentions to the text with some degree of confidence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 See R. Garnett, 'Ben Jonson's Probable Authorship of Scene 2, Act IV, of Fletcher's Bloody Brother', MP , 2 (1905), 489 and Johnstone Parr, Tamburlaine's Malady and Other Essays on Astrology in Elizabethan Drama (1953), pp. 91-92, n. 19. I have no speculations on the authorship of the astrological scene, though I would emphasise that the play was not first printed until almost fifteen years after Fletcher's death—one reason, perhaps, for the corruptions embedded in the received texts. There are two important quarto printings of the play: The Bloody Brother. A tragedy. By B.J.F. , London, 1639 (Q1) and The Tragœdy of Rollo Duke of Normandy . . . Written by John Fletcher Gent. , Oxford, 1640 (Q2). Both quartos received corrections at press; see Rollo Duke of Normandy , ed. J. D. Jump (1948), pp. x, xii. None of the corrections affected the lines discussed in detail here. The passages in question have been inspected in the following copies: Beinecke Library, Yale; Bodleian Library (Q1: Malone 205(5); Q2: 4° T. 36 Art. and Malone 177 (2)); Boston Public Library; British Library (Q1: Ashley 88 and 161.i.47; Q2: 644.e.2); Dyce Library; Folger Shakespeare Library; Houghton Library, Harvard; Humanities Research Centre, University of Texas (Q1 uncorr.); Huntington Library; and Newberry Library. Except where indicated, quotations are taken from Q2, lineation being taken from the Jump edition. 2 The matter of independent specification is important for the following reason: the relation of zodiacal signs and astrological houses is not fixed—in the course of twenty-four hours all twelve signs will have occupied all twelve houses. But when once the relation between any one sign and any one astrological house has been established for a particular moment, then the exact relation between all the other signs and all the other houses may be deduced (for a given latitude). The matching-up of signs and houses must therefore be tabulated with some care, or self- contradictions will easily creep in. The scene establishes early on that Libra 24° is in the ascendant ('how are the Cardines? . . . Libra in twenty foure . . .'; lines 162-163), and this is a matching of the two circles upon which all else hangs. 3 See Cyrus Hoy, 'The Shares of Fletcher and his Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon (VI)', Studies in Bibliography , 14 (1961), 56. 4 The phrase 'in the Imo cœli ' has already been used (line 167). 5 This correction to the text suggests a further small change. In Q2 the text reads: Ith' seaventh house, Aries being his naturall house, And where he is now seated: and all these shew him To be the Almuter (for 'Almuten'). (lines 175-177) A casual reading of this would of course lead us to believe Mars is 'now seated' in Aries; but such a supposition is directly contradicted by line 166 (' Mars . . . [in] the third house'), by lines 213-214 (' Mars being | . . . in Capricorne '), and by implication in lines 196-202 (which place Mars 90° away from the moon which is in Scorpio). We must either regard the assigning Mars to the seventh as a momentary lapse, or else delete the second 'and' in line 176: And where he is now seated: all these shew him . . . The deletion of the second 'and' will cause Q2's colon to mark an anacoluthon. 6 The difficulty cannot be resolved by supposing that the 90-degree aspect is read in two directions, one clockwise, the other anticlockwise, since the angular separation between Sagittarius in the third house and Aries in the seventh is 60° too small to allow such a solution. 7 To illustrate its definition of 'hyleg' the OED quotes this passage, but in the following manner: 'Mars out of the self same house . . . Looks at the Hilege with a quartile ruling'. This quotation leaves the line which follows entirely stranded syntactically. With the deletion of 'ruling', however, it would convey more or less adequately the sense of the passage.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">John Nourse and His Authors by John Feather</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The rise of the professional author is perhaps the most neglected topic in the history of the book trade; the author, the fountainhead of the trade, has been ignored by historians both of publishing and, in his capacity as paid worker, of literature. This is especially true of the eighteenth century; A. S. Collins's pioneering studies have not yet been bettered, partly because so little research has been undertaken. 1 More recent general studies, based almost entirely on materials known to Collins, have been at best cursory 2 or misleading, 3 and at worst inaccurate; 4 all, moreover, have tended to treat the eighteenth century as a mere prelude to the great age of the periodical and the popular novel. Yet all these scholars agree that it was in the eighteenth century that authorship, for the first time, became a viable profession for a substantial number of practitioners. It is only through the study of individual authors and publishers that we can begin to understand how this happened, and what the rewards of authorship actually were, especially for those who wrote at the lower levels of literature, the so-called 'hacks'. Many literary biographers attempt to assess their subjects' earnings, but only one scholar has offered a detailed analysis of a major author's finances, 5 and there is only one general history of eighteenth-century authorship which has attempted a scholarly synthesis. 6 This paper, based on the agreements, accounts, and correspondence of John Nourse, is intended to go some way towards filling the gap; 7 it is a study of one publisher's dealings with a group of authors, offered as an attempt to establish a context for the more familiar literary copyright agreements, and to show how the trade dealt with authors of no great fame or merit. John Nourse was known in his own day as a publisher and importer of French books, and of scientific works, which some of these agreements reflect, and also as bookseller to George III; when he died in 1780 he had been in the trade for about half a century, and had established a good reputation both with the public and with his fellow booksellers. 8 Like most of his contemporaries he was a retail bookseller as well as a publisher, although he was one of those whose publishing activities overshadowed his retailing, and who led the way towards the emergence of the publisher in the modern sense. These agreements suggest that he was not ungenerous to some of his authors, and his interest in the plight of the professional author, a matter of concern to any professional publisher, is further attested by his acting as one of the booksellers for the Society for the Encouragement of Learning between 1735 and 1749. 9 In considering the agreements, we have to distinguish between various categories: firstly, Nourse purchased copyrights, both of books which he commissioned, and of unsolicited works, in both cases on differing terms; secondly, he secured various rights in the future publication of an author's books. Fortunately, enough documents survive for us to construct a wideranging picture of his dealings with authors, and to draw some conclusions about their income and his profits. These matters occupy Part I of this paper; in Part II, I have attempted to provide a context in which the Nourse documents can be compared with other, and more familiar, records.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I A. The Purchase of Copies 1. Commissioned Books When Nourse commissioned an author to write a book he normally specified (i) its length; (ii) the time allowed for completion; (iii) the fee; (iv) the means of payment of the fee; and (v) the assignment of the copyright in the first and future editions. The length of the book obviously varied according to subject, and the time allowed for composition according to both subject and length. Length was specified in printed sheets, according to format, and the normal form of agreement states that the type size shall be the same as that in some recently published work to give both the author and the publisher a standard of comparison. Variations of more interest are found in the fees paid, and in the means of payment. (a) Fees The fees which Nourse paid varied from £1.1s.od. to £3.3s.od. per sheet. The normal form of agreement was for a fee for the whole book, but a few are for payment by sheet; the pattern seems to be that Nourse paid by the sheet when the length of the book was in doubt. Thomas Barlow, a lawyer at the Middle Temple, signed an agreement with Nourse on 4 January 1733 to write a 'Treatise concerning the Duty and office of a Justice of peace'; he was to be paid £2.2s.od. per sheet, for between 25 and 30 sheets of printed folio, including whatever tables, statutes, and precedents he thought it necessary to include. There was clearly some indecision about the probable size of the work; on 5 June 1734 a further agreement allowed Barlow to go up to 40 sheets. The publication of the book was, however, delayed for a decade. Not until 8 August 1744 did Barlow receive £126.0s.od., the payment for 60 sheets, but in a document of the same date, in which Barlow confirmed the assignment of the copyright to Nourse, it was acknowledged that he had actually written about 150 sheets. The book was published, as The Justice of the Peace: a Treatise , in 1745, in 154 sheets, with a further 5½ sheets of preliminaries. Clearly Nourse was not prepared to pay Barlow for having so greatly exceeded the limits set in the original agreement. Nourse was, however, willing to allow some margin for error or change. When he commissioned John Mills to write 'a Work on the subject of Trade &amp; Commerce' in 1765, it was agreed that the author would receive £2.2s.od. per sheet for 60 sheets, but he was allowed to go up to 80 sheets, pro rata , if necessary; Mills actually received £124.4s.od. between 5 June 1765 and 22 December 1766, the payment for just over 118 sheets, although the book was, apparently, never published in this form. 10 Even vaguer was the commission to Joseph Shaw to write 'a new treatise Intitled Parish Law' in 1731; for £2.2s.od. per sheet, 12°, Shaw was to write up to 15 sheets. More specific was the agreement with John Landen for his Mathematical Lucubrations ; he was to be paid £1.1s.od. per sheet for 18 to 20 sheets, 4°. Landen almost kept within his limits; the book, which Nourse published in 1755, has 20¾ sheets, and five engraved plates. The same fee was paid to Marie Le Prince de Beaumont for her Magasin des Adolescentes , 4 volumes, 12°; and to Elias Palairet for a 'Dictionnary of the Ellipses' commissioned in 1760. Agreements for payment by sheet are, however, exceptional; Nourse's normal form of contract was for a fee for a specified length of book. If the author exceeded that length he received no extra payment. Such a condition was explicit in the agreement with Robert Dossie for 'The Mysteries of Art displayed' in 1757, published in the following year as the first volume of The Handmaid to the Arts ; Dossie was to receive £63.os.od. for 30 sheets, but was to be paid the same even if one or two additional sheets proved to be necessary for the satisfactory completion of the book. The £2.2s.od. which Barlow, Mills, and Shaw were paid seems to have been about Nourse's average fee. Dossie received the equivalent sum for three works, all in two volumes. Anthony Vieyra received only £1.1s.od. per sheet for a Portuguese dictionary, but he also had as much again in books. The next lowest cash payment was the £1.7s.od. per sheet which was the most that Thomas Deletanville could have earned from A New Set of Exercises upon the Various Parts of French Speech ; he was to be paid £9.9s.od. for 7 or 8 sheets, including proof correcting. In fact, he received £15.15s.od. in all, the extra £6.6s.od. being for 3½ sheets which Nourse added to the original agreement at a later date. At the other extreme, the same author was paid £157.1os.od. for a French dictionary; this was commissioned in 1761, but the final payment, due on delivery of the manuscript, was not made until 1771, despite a two-year time limit in the agreement. The commission was for about 54 sheets, or approximately £2.18s.od. per sheet. Presumably Nourse, and his co-publisher Paul Vaillant, took into account the quantity of work involved, but there is still a marked contrast with the £1.1s.od. paid to Vieyra for his labours, even when his payments in kind are taken into account. As we shall see, however, Deletanville was a good deal easier to deal with than his fellow lexicographer. Some authors received copies of their books as well as monetary payments; some were probably for presentation, but others could be sold, often to pre-publication subscribers. Vieyra was to have copies to the value of £210.os.od., or exactly the same as his cash fee. Marie Le Prince de Beaumont received 150 copies of her Magasin des Adolescentes , which compensated her for a fee of only £1.1s.od. per sheet for writing the book. William Lewis was to have 100 copies of his The New Dispensatory , a pharmacoepia which Nourse published in 1753; Lewis was paid £85.os.od., or just over £2.2s.od. per sheet, for 40 sheets, although the book as published has 42½ sheets, and 2¾ sheets of preliminaries. Elias Palairet was allowed 12 copies of his 'Dictionnary of the Ellipses', which we can assume were for presentation to actual or potential patrons whom this rising young cleric was cultivating; his cash payment was only £1.1s.od. per sheet, so Nourse drove a notably hard bargain in this instance. John Robertson had the same number of his Elements of Navigation for which he was to receive £2.2s.od. per sheet, up to a limit of £96.12s.od., or 46 sheets. There is no means of knowing how these agreements were reached, but it seems that the publisher usually had the upper hand. Indeed some of them are written on manuscript pro formas which appear to be in a legal hand, and in which spaces have been left for the author's name, the title, and the fee. The initiative for payment in kind may sometimes have come from the author if he wished to send copies to patrons or friends or was already committed to subscribers, as Le Prince de Beaumont was with Magasin des Adolescentes ; 11 but it was also to Nourse's advantage, for it enabled him to conserve his supplies of liquid capital, a perpetual concern for all eighteenth-century businessmen. The agreements for payment in kind, whatever the motive, are distinctly atypical, and it is notable that Palairet, despite the two forms of payment, was treated rather badly by Nourse's usual standards, although, conversely, the treatment of Robertson was distinctly generous. In one case, books alone constituted an author's reward for her labours: Le Prince de Beaumont received 150 copies of Education complète, ou abrégé de l'histoire universelle , 3 volumes, 12°, 1753, but no monetary payment at all; her sales of her copies were not guaranteed for there is no list of prepublication subscribers. (b) Methods of Payment All the agreements have a clause in which the time and method of payment are specified. Nourse had three normal practices for books which he had commissioned. Sometimes he undertook to pay sheet by sheet as the work progressed, but this was possible only for books for which he was paying by the sheet; for such books, however, this method was almost invariable, for Barlow, Shaw, and Mills were all recompensed in this way, as was Landen for his Mathematical Lucubrations . A modified form of the same method was used to pay Vieyra and Deletanville for their dictionaries. Such arrangements worked to Nourse's benefit at least as much as to the author's; on the whole, it was the expensive books which were paid for in installments, which not only reduced Nourse's outlay at any one time, but also had the incidental effect of keeping the author at work. It is also notable, however, that Nourse paid by the completed sheet when the author was a man with whom he dealt infrequently, or only once. The authors from whom he regularly commissioned work were paid by a third method. Robert Dossie, the most frequent author in the extant agreements, was paid half of his fee when the book was commissioned, and half on the delivery of the manuscript. Deletanville, another prolific author, was, on two occasions, paid half of his fee on delivery, and half on publication; these payments were for The Child's Guide to the French Tongue in 1757 and 1758, and A New Set of Exercises in January and February 1758. Payment before completion was obviously fraught with difficulties and dangers for the publisher. William Lewis seems to have failed to complete 'a New practice of Physick', for although he acknowledged receipt of £52. 10s.od., which constituted half his fee, on the day the agreement was signed, there is no receipt for the other half, and no evidence that the book was ever published. On the other hand, relations between Nourse and Lewis continued to be good, as we shall see, and we may suspect that this book was abandoned by agreement. It is fortunate that in addition to the agreements there are some extant accounts with authors, from which we can trace in detail the progress of a book, and of the payments for it. The account with Vieyra is particularly illuminating in this respect. In the agreement, dated 9 November 1765, Vieyra undertook to produce 200 sheets, 4°, for £210.os.od., plus copies of the book to the same value at Nourse's wholesale price; the £210.os.od. was to be paid in monthly installments of £5.5s.od. for as long as the work was in hand, and it seems that Nourse required evidence of this. In practice, Vieyra never had his £5.5s.od. per month regularly; on 6 December 1765, he received £10.1os.od., and the same sum, at two-monthly intervals, from February to December in the next year. The payments then became much less regular. He had his £10.1os.od. in February 1767, but no more until June, when he received five months' payment, a total of £26.5s.od., including, presumably, one month's work paid for in advance. The next payment, however, was not until February 1768, when Vieyra received £10.1os.od., a gap only partially filled by a payment of £21.os.od. in the next month. When these payments are taken together, it seems that Vieyra was not paid for two months in 1767, presumably months in which he did no work on the dictionary. In April 1768 he received a single month's payment; perhaps Nourse was trying to bring him to order, but, if so, he failed, for after that there is no regular pattern of payment at all. Vieyra had £10.1os.od. in November 1768, a single payment of £42.os.od. in 1769, the fee for eight months' work, and no more until he received £154.18s.6d. in September 1770. This figure is difficult to explain: he may have been doing other work for Nourse, but this is unlikely since the account is headed 'for the Portuguese Dictionary'; more probably, it was a pro rata payment for work actually completed. £7.7s.od. in February 1771, and £6.6s.od. in April of the same year, brought Vieyra's receipts up to £359.1s.6d.; this was considerably more than Nourse had contracted to pay, but as there is no record of the books given to Vieyra, it may be that Nourse subtracted the £149.1s.6d. from the value of Vieyra's complimentary copies. The book was finally published in 1773. Nourse's accounts, like so many others in the days before books were open to inspection by the Internal Revenue, are often obscure and sometimes imprecise; some are little more than jottings of payments. Nevertheless, the outlines of his dealings with Vieyra are clear enough for us to draw some conclusions from them. If Nourse had intended the installment plan as a means of keeping Vieyra at work, he was unsuccessful in the long run, but at least he ensured that the dictionary started well, with 20 months of continuous work from December 1765 to July 1767, and another continuous period probably from October 1767 to April 1768. In the rest of 1768, however, only two months' work was submitted, and by September 1770, when he made his last payment, Nourse was certainly paying for work actually completed, rather than on a simple monthly basis. By July 1769, when he paid for eight months' work, it must have been obvious to Nourse that his outlay would exceed the £210.os.od. for which he had contracted, and it seems to have been then that he decided to pay Vieyra pro rata . On the basis of the extant accounts it would seem that he suffered both losses and delays in his dealings with this author, and that he was a good deal more flexible than the letter of the contract allowed him to be even when Vieyra was not working consistently. Deletanville was paid in equal installments for as long as he was at work on his French dictionary. Again the account survives, but it is easier to interpret than that with Vieyra. The publication was a joint one between Nourse and Vaillant, so that when Deletanville submitted his final account on 6 April 1771, half of the liability was Vaillant's. The publishers had undertaken to pay the author £154.1os.od. for about 54 sheets; Deletanville, an experienced author, submitted 55. He added, however, £34.7s.od. for a further 12½ sheets, 'necessary to compleat the work', slightly less than the pro rata cost; and another £1.1s.od. for 'the Dictionaire de Richelet' which he had bought to assist him. Of the resulting total, Nourse's share was £96. 9s.od.. In fact, Deletanville had been receiving his installments at regular intervals. He had £10.1os.1od. on 25 March and 25 September 1762, and 24 March 1763 (and presumably from Vaillant on the other quarter days), £15.15s.od. in October 1764, and further payments of £10.1os.od. in November 1765, and June 1767. Progress had been slow, but it had also been regular and reliable. Thus Nourse owed Deletanville £30.19s.od. which he paid three weeks after the author's final statement was submitted, on 30 April 1771. With a reliable author, this method of payment worked to the advantage of both parties: Deletanville had a regular income, and Nourse was able to spread his investment. 2. Unsolicited Books (a) Purchases of Completed Manuscripts In the surviving agreements there are only two certain instances of Nourse purchasing the unprinted manuscript of a work which he had not commissioned; it is significant that in both cases his terms were somewhat less generous than those for commissioned works. On 1 October 1769 Thomas Tyrrell agreed to sell Nourse the manuscript of 'Lettres et Memoires pour servir à l'histoire du Cap Breton ou Isle Roïale' for £31.1os.od., together with 100 books of the author's choice; Tyrrell was also to receive 25 copies of his own book when it was published, but there is no evidence that it was. In addition, Nourse would arrange for a translation to be made and printed, and again Tyrrell was to receive 25 copies; this translation, like the original, was not published, so far as can be traced. Although Tyrrell probably received the equivalent of Nourse's payments to his commissioned authors, the presentation of 100 books from his own stock was a far slighter drain on Nourse's liquid resources than cash payments would have been. It would, however, appear that the author retained the copyright, which gave him, theoretically, the possibility of additional income from the book in the future. John Landen fared even less well than Tyrrell. In 1755 Nourse had published his Mathematical Lucubrations which he had commissioned at £1.1s.od. per sheet, but in 1760 they negotiated a contract which was less favorable to the author. When the agreement was signed on 22 January 1760, Landen had completed the manuscript of The residual analysis , which was expected to make about 30 sheets, 4°; in return for the copyright, and for the cost of printing, Landen was to receive 100 copies for his subscribers, from whom he derived his only income for the book. In fact, this work was notably unsuccessful. It seems that the intention was to publish it in two parts, for the first volume, 'Part 1,' has only 17 sheets and 5 plates; a manuscript note on the title-page of the copy in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (shelfmark Savile Ii. 15), records correctly that this was 'all that was ever published'. Landen was destined for distinction as a scientist, but was never a successful author. 12 (b) Purchase of a Printed Edition As an important London bookseller Nourse had the advantage of easy access to the national book distribution system which was effectively controlled by the leading members of the London trade. This placed him in a position to bargain with his authors, and especially with those who had already paid to have their books printed and now wanted a wholesaler and distributor. As a consequence, when he purchased the whole, or a substantial part, of an edition, he was able to drive a hard bargain. Thomas Lally, a clergyman, received nothing at all for 700 copies of his translation of The Principles of the Christian Religion except the cost of production, and the promise of £21.os.od. if there was another edition; there was not. John Palairet assigned a ½-share in his New English Spelling Book to Nourse in 1746, in return for the £10.1os.od. which Nourse had already spent on advertising the book; the implication of the agreement is that it was already in print and that Nourse had undertaken the marketing. 13 In 1750 Palairet sold all the rights in this book to Nourse for £15.15s.od.; the sale included the copper-plates which had to be engraved at the author's expense. There are two rather more generous agreements. Palairet himself was the beneficiary of one of them, when, in 1733, he sold all 1,000 copies of the second edition of his 'Grammar' to Nourse for a total of £55.os.od., half of which was payable immediately, and half in six months' time. It is probably significant that this was at the beginning of Nourse's career when he was less able to deal from strength in contracting with authors, but he made a good bargain, for the 'Grammar' can be identified as The New Royal French Grammar which was frequently reprinted. 14 Finally, George Aylette, a surgeon, received the equivalent of Nourse's commission payments for his 'compendium of Physick &amp; Surgery' in 1768; the book, in 30 to 34 sheets, 8°, had been printed at the author's expense, but Nourse bought the whole edition for £52.10s.od. plus the cost of production, with a promise of £52.10s.od. for any and all future editions. B. The Purchase of Rights In some instances, it is not clear exactly what it was that Nourse bought. In 1760, for example, he paid Palairet £21.1os.od. for the rights in Nouvelle introduction à la géographie moderne , published in 3 volumes in 1754 and 1755; the plates were included in the sale, which suggests that Nourse envisaged publishing another edition, although he does not seem to have done so. Another ambiguous agreement with the same author is that for A Short Treatise upon Arts and Sciences , dated 16 May 1738; Nourse paid £10.10.od. for the sole rights in the copy. It is possible, however, that the book was already in print, for the first extant edition, that of 1741, is the third. These ambiguities lead us to consider the second major category of Nourse's dealings: his purchases of whole or part shares in existing, forthcoming, or future editions, especially the latter. 1. Future Editions We have already seen some examples of Nourse explicitly purchasing the right to publish future editions of a work; additionally, this right was implicit in any agreement for the outright purchase of a copy, as was the case with commissioned works. There are, however, some agreements in which he deviated from his standard practices. An Essay towards a Practical English Grammar , and The Royal English Grammar , which was an abridged version of the same work, were both purchased by Nourse from their author, James Greenwood, in 1736. Nourse paid Greenwood £42.1os.od. for the rights to any and all future editions. In fact, he made little profit from this; his first edition was the fourth of 1740, which was still in print in 1753 when it was advertised in volume 1 of Le Prince de Beaumont's Education complète . That work was itself published under an agreement which gave Nourse unlimited rights to reprint without payment, in return for which he gave the author 150 copies of the first edition, and no cash. Not all of these agreements, however, were as unfavorable to the author as that with Le Prince de Beaumont; indeed there are some in which Nourse was very generous. William Lewis was a notable beneficiary. Nourse paid him £105.os.od. for The New English Dispensatory , published in 1753, six years after the agreement was signed. In addition, Lewis received 100 free copies, and had the right to revise future editions if he wished to do so; even if he did not wish to revise the work himself, he still retained control over its contents for he was permitted to see any revisions which were made by others, and no revised edition was to appear without his consent. The second edition appeared, with the author's revisions, in 1765; for his work, Lewis received £52.1os.od. and 100 copies. There were three further revisions, in 1770, 1781, and 1785, for which no documentation has survived. For 'a New practice of Physick' Lewis was to be paid £105.os.od. for two volumes, 8°, and then £31.1os.od. for the second edition, and £21.os.od. for each of the third and fourth; it was further specified that no edition should exceed 1,000 copies. Such contracts as this were at least as favorable to the author as they were to the publisher. Lewis was not the only author with whom Nourse made agreements for future payments. When Greenwood sold his two grammatical works to Nourse, one clause in the contract granted him a further £10.1os.od. if more than 1,000 copies were sold, although, as we have seen, this clause probably never took effect. An edition size of 1,000 seems to have been the norm upon which Nourse based his contractual arrangements. For The Elements of Navigation , published in 1754, John Robertson received £96.12s.od., and 12 copies of the book, for 43 sheets, 8°; Nourse had the rights in all future editions, but for each of them, none of which was to exceed 1,000 copies, Robertson was to receive £24.13s.od., and 12 copies. This author, unlike Greenwood, profited from the arrangement; there were further editions of his book in 1764, 1772, 1780, and 1796. Indeed, he actually received more than the contract envisaged, for Nourse paid him £16.16s.od. for eight extra sheets for the 1764 edition, and raised the fee for subsequent editions to £28.7s.od.. Specified payments for revisions appear elsewhere. For his Thesaurus ellipsium Latinarum , Palairet was paid £1.1s.od. per sheet, but was to have 10s.6d. per sheet for revising any future edition. Le Prince de Beaumont, on the other hand, had no commitment to Nourse for one form of revision of her Magasin pour servir à l'instruction des jeunes personnes ; Nourse was entitled to arrange for an English translation if he so wished, but the author was free to write and publish a version suitable for Roman Catholics, a right easily ceded by Nourse since the market for such a version would be chiefly outside England. 2. Joint Publications Nourse did not always undertake the whole risk of an edition himself. Barlow's Justice of the Peace was originally to have been a joint publication between Nourse and Francis Coggan, but in 1742, 9 years after the original agreement was signed, Coggan sold his ½-share to Nourse. No further documents survive, but it seems that Nourse re-sold this share to John and Paul Knapton, for their names appear with his in the imprint of the edition published in 1745. Coggan was also joint owner of Shaw's Parish Law ; Deletanville's Dictionary was a joint venture with Paul Vaillant; and Lewis's New Dispensatory started as a joint publication with Thomas Longman, although only Nourse's name appears in the imprint. In addition to these, one book, Robert Dossie's Memoirs of Agriculture , was sponsored, and may have been subsidised, by the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce; and Abraham Le Moine sold only half the rights in his Treatise on Miracles , and took half the profits, an arrangement which was to apply to all subsequent editions. C. Costs and Profits Detailed accounts do not survive for the costs of production of most of the books, and, unfortunately, the one exception is for a book with a nonstandard contract. This exception is Le Prince de Beaumont's Education complète , for which Nourse paid only in kind, in the form of 150 copies. An edition of 1,250 was printed in 1753, and the account shows a loss of 6d., and 127 copies on hand (Table I). From the remaining 127 copies, however, Nourse could make £22.4s.6d. at the wholesale price of 3s.6d., and he may have charged 5s.od. retail, a potential profit of £31.15s.od. He was a retail TABLE I Education complète , 1753: profit and loss account DEBIT £ s. d. CREDIT £ s. d.

Calculations of cost and profit on the other books must necessarily be speculation, but we can base them upon three reasonably firm assumptions: firstly, that 14s.od. per ream represented the quality of paper which Nourse usually used, as comparison of Education complète with his other books suggests that it was; secondly, that his normal edition size was 1,000; and thirdly, that he paid his printers the average price calculated from the Strahan ledgers, that is £1.os.od. per sheet set in Great Primer, English, or Pica, the usual text types in his books. 15 These calculations, approximate as they are, nevertheless provide a context in which we can judge Nourse's payments to his authors. As an example, we can take Dossie's Elaboratory Laid Open ; the author received £31.10s.od. for 18 sheets, and in fact delivered matter to fill 26. His fee is included in the costs (Table II). If Nourse sold the whole edition at 2s.6d. wholesale, his profit was £46.2s.od., or about 25% more than the author's income from the book. Similar figures emerge if we approximate TABLE II Elaboratory Laid Open , 1758: approximate costs £ s. d. Paper (26,000 sheets = 52 reams app. &amp;c.mmat; 14s.od.) 36 8 0 Printing (26 sheets &amp;c.mmat; £1) 26 0 0 Advertisements, &amp;c. 10 0 0 -------- 72 8 0 Payment to author 31 10 0 -------- TOTAL 103 18 0 -------- the cost of publishing a book by another of Nourse's major authors, John Palairet.

The book was printed in 3 volumes, containing 53 sheets (Table III). TABLE III Nouvelle introduction . . ., 1754,55: approximate costs £ s. d.

Nourse's profits would have been £18.2s.od.; at 4s.3d. (a retail price of 6s.od.) he would have made £35.12s.od. These figures all exclude the cost of binding, as do Nourse's own accounts for Education complète , although there was probably at least a partial edition binding for that work. The copy in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, 16 is uncut in blue boards, and is the copy deposited under the provisions of the Copyright Act. It has all the appearance of a trade binding, which would clearly have to be added to the cost of production, but the wholesale copies, especially those intended for export, were almost certainly sold in sheets. Nourse's '&amp;c.' may indeed include the cost of binding part of the edition, although we have seen that in at least one instance he did spend £10.os.od. on advertising. Whatever these minor costs may have been, it is clear that Nourse made a comfortable margin of profit if an edition was sold out, and that he was both able and willing to pay his authors fees which bore a reasonable relation to his own profits.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Although the surviving agreements represent only a small proportion of Nourse's dealings with authors during his career in the trade, they are notable for their variety. Nourse commissioned manuscripts; he bought them; he bought editions of printed books; he bought and sold rights in copies, translations, abridgements, adaptations, and future editions. His fees were variable, but within fairly restricted limits, and he varied his means of payment for his own and his authors' convenience. In this variety he was typical of eighteenth-century English publishers, for we can find parallels for almost all of Nourse's forms of agreement. Commissions by the sheet were common, although perhaps more usual for periodicals than for books; Mark Akenside, for example, received £100.os.od. per annum for writing The Museum in the 1740s, and was required to produce 1½ sheets in Small Pica every fortnight. 17 It was not unknown for poets to be paid by the line; even Dryden at the height of his fame had a contract of this sort for the Fables (Saunders, p. 130). There were, however, profit-sharing agreements, parallel to that between Nourse and Le Moine; such was the arrangement between Gibbon and Cadeil for Decline and Fall , under which the author apparently had a right to ⅔ of the profits. 18 Outright purchase was nevertheless the most common form of agreement, even for unsolicited works; it continued to be so until the middle of the nineteenth century, and, according to Diderot, the same was true in France and in other European countries during the eighteenth century. 19 In this respect, Nourse was entirely typical. Literary scholars have frequently misunderstood the relationship between authors and their publishers in the age before royalties, and have consequently condemned the trade unfairly. A famous example is that of the copyright of Paradise Lost for which Samuel Simmons agreed to pay the poet £5.5s.od. for each of three editions of 1,500 copies; in all, Milton and his widow received £18.os.od. 20 The general implied condemnation of Simmons is more than a little unfair. He was taking a political as well as a commercial risk in publishing a poem by an unrepentant republican who was lucky to have escaped with his life, and a poem moreover which was both long and difficult, and unlikely to appeal to the reading public of Restoration London. Even so, Milton's contract was generous, including as it did an agreement to pay additional fees when further editions were published. It is unlikely that Simmons made a great profit from this unfashionable and expensive book. It took half a century for Paradise Lost to be established as a classic and, while it is true that a number of eighteenth-century booksellers made a great deal of money from it, this was not least because Milton's cause was so assiduously promoted by one of their number, Jacob Tonson. 21 By the middle of the eighteenth century competent writers could and did command high prices for popular books. Fielding's £700 for Tom Jones (Saunders, p. 139), and Smollett's £2,000 for his History of England (Ransom, p. 61) were exceptional, but the unknown Samuel Johnson was paid £15.15s.od. for his Life of Savage in 1743 (Fleeman, p. 212), a figure not unlike those paid by Nourse for commissioned works of a similar length. The equally unknown Alexander Pope received £16.2s.6d. for a translation of Statius at the beginning of his career (Saunders, p. 135), and for an undistinguished translation of Don Quixote Dodsley gave Charles Jarvis's widow £21.os.od. and 15 copies of the book (Straus, p. 87). Lintot paid Theobald 4d. for 3 lines of Sophocles, and 6½d. for 3 lines of Horace, the former to include a commentary, but this was a low rate. 22 At the very lowest level of literature, the political hack and failed lawyer William Arnall earned nearly £11,000 in four years from Walpole, which, with the pension on which he retired, was a more than adequate financial reward, and perhaps even offered some comfort for his appearance in The Dunciad . 23 This is the context of Nourse's agreements: purchase of rights was not universal, but it was usual, and payments reached £100 only for a few writers and works, or in exceptional circumstances. Moreover, we have to remember that a large number of eighteenth-century authors, indeed probably the majority of them, were not, unlike Arnall or Johnson, dependent upon their pens for a living. This was certainly the case with Nourse's writers. George Ayelette was a surgeon; Theodore Barlow was a lawyer, and so, probably, was Joseph Shaw; James Greenwood was Sur-Master at St. Paul's School; John Landen was surveyor to Lord Fitzwilliam; Abraham Le Moine was Rector of Evereley in Wiltshire; William Lewis was a practising physician; Elias Palairet was a clergyman on the first rung of the ladder of preferment as chaplain to the Bishop of Bangor; John Palairet was London agent for the Dutch government; and John Robertson taught mathematics at Christ's Hospital. 24 The professional authors were the exception amongst those with whom Nourse was dealing, and the receipts of the others have to be seen as supplementary income. Robert Dossie, described as a gentleman of St. James's, Westminster, does not seem to have had any profession other than writing, although he may have had other sources of private income. Even if this were not the case, he did not starve. From March 1757 to December 1760 he was continuously at work for Nourse, writing five works, three of them in two volumes. For these labors he received a total of £347.11s.od., an income of nearly £100 per annum (Table IV). Moreover, this represents only his income from TABLE IV Robert Dossie's income from Nourse 1757-60 Income Year totals Date £ s. d. Book £ s. d. 1757 Mar 15 15 0 Elaboratory Laid Open Aug 27 6 0 ibid.

Dossie wrote other books for Nourse, and for other publishers, in later years, including a play, The statesman foil'd , in 1768. Nothing is known of him, but it seems likely that the gentleman of St. James's, Westminster, was an amateur scientist and an aspirant playwright who supported himself largely by his writings. None of the other authors worked for Nourse regularly enough for comparable calculations to be made, or, if they did, the evidence has not survived. We have already noted, however, that Nourse and Vaillant paid Deletanville at regular intervals while he was at work on the French dictionary, and that Nourse paid Vieyra regularly for the Portuguese dictionary for as long as there was evidence of progress. John Nourse never made his authors rich, but he did not cause, or allow, them to die in garrets. The inevitable concentration on relationships between literary writers and their publishers has disguised some essential facts about the role of the author in the eighteenth-century book trade. Firstly, he was often not a professional author at all, but a clergyman, a schoolmaster, or other professional man, seeking to increase his reputation and only incidentally his income. Those who were professional authors seem to have been paid reasonably well as long as they kept their side of the bargain and wrote their books. 25 Secondly, although there are examples of publishers making large profits from books whose authors did not benefit from them, in most cases the author received a fair reward for a work which was never likely to make a fortune for anyone. In such circumstances, the sale of rights was preferable to profit-sharing, for not only did it simplify the publisher's accounting, it also guaranteed the author at least some income, even if only in the form of one or two cash payments and a few books. When there was a reasonable expectation of large profits, payments to authors were normally correspondingly large; or, as in the case of Tom Jones , there were negotiations, or ex gratia payments. Indeed, if John Nourse is typical of the leading members of the trade, as he seems to be, we can conclude that eighteenth-century English authors were not ill-treated by their publishers as long as they were able to produce saleable work without too great a delay.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX B ELIZABETH BLACKWELL'S CURIOUS HERBAL The transactions with Elizabeth Blackwell for the distribution of her A Curious Herbal , published in 1737, are unique in the extant documents. The authoress and her husband had had the book printed at their own expense, a very costly undertaking, since it is in two folio volumes and has 625 engraved plates, which, in some copies, are hand-colored; there is no letterpress. The Blackwells were in financial difficulties even before this project started, and they soon become worse. Their first bookseller was Samuel Harding, whose name appears in the imprint of some copies of both volumes; they subsequently approached Nourse, perhaps because he was better able to distribute and advertise the book, or perhaps because they felt that he would be willing to invest in it. On 28 September 1737, three months after publication, Nourse paid £150.os.od. for a ⅓-share, which entitled him to a ⅓-share of the profits, and gave him ownership of ⅓ of the text plates. As a guarantee to him, he was to take possession of his share of the plates, and was granted the right to a ⅓-share in any future work by Mrs. Blackwell on the same subject. These guarantees are so like security against a loan that the transaction has to be seen in that light rather than as normal trading in shares in copies. In February 1739 the Blackwells needed money again, perhaps to settle the printer's bills, and they arrived at a further agreement with Nourse in which he was able to protect his earlier investment. He paid £319.4s.6d. for the sole rights in the book. He was given all remaining unsold copies, and the rights in all future editions. Of the unsold copies, however, only ⅓ were for his profit; this was his fee for marketing the other ⅔ of which the profits went to the Blackwells. When his expenses were covered, however, any remaining part of the Blackwells' ⅔ was to be returned to them for their own use and profit. This in fact never happened. At this point, the title-leaves of both volumes were cancelled, and cancellantes printed dated 1739, and with Nourse's name instead of Harding's in the imprint; there are, however, some mixed sets, including one in the British Library, London (34. i. 12.-13.), and one in the library of the Royal Society of Medicine, London. The book was reissued, with further cancellantes, in 1751, but was never reprinted. For full details of the complex bibliographical history of A Curious Herbal , see Blanche Henrey, British Botanical and Horticultural Literature Before 1800 (1976), II, 228-234, and III, 9-10. I am indebted to Mr J. F. Fuggles of the British Library for his help with this matter. In October 1740 the Blackwells sold Nourse a further ⅙-share in the copyright for £75.0s.0d., and in 1747 he bought the ½-share which they still owned for a mere £20.0s.0d.; at that time they owed Nourse £108.13s.0d., for expenses incurred on their behalf in marketing and coloring the book. In effect he acted as their wholesaler, but the book was so expensive, and sold so slowly, that they were obliged to sell it to him because they could not sustain their expenses. There are no other transactions of this kind in the extant documents, but this case, although apparently unique in Nourse's business, is of great interest in illustrating the difficulties inherent in publishing an expensive book for which no commercial publisher could be found, and which, even though sold in weekly parts, attracted few subscribers (R. M. Wiles, Serial Publication in England before 1750 (1957), p. 312).</field>

Longman may, however, have been involved in 'A general view', the title given in the receipt for Nourse's payment; in October 1768 Nourse paid Mills £28.os.od. of which £18.os.od. was 'By note of M r Longman', but he may merely have endorsed to Mills a bill which Longman had given him on another account. It is clear, however, that Mills had been at work, and it is unlikely that there would be no trace of so substantial a book had it been published. Perhaps Nourse withdrew from the project, in documents which have not survived, and the work was incorporated in New and Complete System . 11 F. J. G. Robinson and P. J.

      <field name="heading_text">The Library of George Tollet, Neglected Shakespearean by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">George Tollet (1725-1799) was admitted to Eton College in 1742, the register of admissions making a tentative identification of him as the son of George Tollet, commissioner of the navy by his wife Elizabeth Oakes, of the Isle of Man. From Eton he, like so many of his schoolmates, went on to King's College, Cambridge, matriculating as a Fellow Commoner in 1744. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 2 July 1745 and was called to the bar in 1751. At some time after the last date he retired to Betley Hall, Staffordshire, which had been purchased by his father, and there he seems to have settled down to the life of a bachelor country gentleman. William Cole, Tollet's contemporary at Cambridge, described him in his Athenœ Cantabrigienses as "a shy, reserved man, of no genteel appearance and behaviour." Cole went on to remark He was much acquainted with the late Mr. Ewin, father of Dr. Ewin, whose sister told me, 1780, that the acquaintance began when she went to Stratford-le-Bow school, where Mr. Tollet's aunt (a little, crooked woman, but a sharp wit, and author of some poems in print) took notice of her. Mr. Tollet has many notes in Mr. Steevens's edition of Shakespeare; in the first volume of which he has an ingenious dissertation on the figures of some pantomimes in his house at Betley, in Staffordshire, a print of which morris-dancers is at the head of it, and sent to me by Mr. Steevens in September, 1780; who was also a Fellow Commoner of the same college, but came thither the year after I left it, viz., in 1753, as he told me at Dr. Lort's chambers in Trinity College. Mr. Tollet died Oct. 22, 1779." ( Lit. Illustr. VIII. 584) As some possible indication of Tollet's character one should know that the DNB describes Thomas Ewin, father of the usurious Dr. Ewin, as "formerly a grocer and latterly a brewer in partnership with one Sparks of St. Sepulchre's, Cambridge." Perhaps it is a measure of Tollet's almost anonymous existence that the editors of Alumni Cantabrigienses were not sure he was "the Shakespearean critic." Tollet would almost surely have been forgotten except for two things: his aunt Elizabeth was a poet and a friend of Newton's and "he contributed some notes [I am quoting the DNB ] to Johnson and Steevens's edition of Shakespeare." Actually, the modest "some" of the DNB account amounts to over four hundred notes in the 1778 edition added to the fifteen contributed to the 1773 edition, making Tollet the greatest single contributor to the commentary on Shakespeare, always excepting the editors of the various editions in the eighteenth century. His notes are on all the plays of the accepted canon except Julius Cœsar , Titus Andronicus (which many thought uncanonical), and Romeo and Juliet (hardly bachelor fare). There are three new notes and an addition to an earlier note posthumously printed in Malone's Supplement (1780). "Shortly before his death," the DNB continues, "he complained that many of his valuable suggestions were appropriated by the editors in the second issue [1778] of their work without acknowledgment." Since he is given credit by name for over 400 notes in the 1778 Shakespeare , one of them, ten pages long, describing the figures of morris-dancers on a painted glass window at Betley and reproducing them in a folded insert titled "Morris Dancers. From an Ancient Window in the House of George Tollet Esq. at Betley in Staffordshire," this statement may be discounted almost entirely. What I wish to do is succumb to the temptation of a conjectural reconstruction of Tollet's library by reference to his notes on Shakespeare. Since in most of his notes Tollet gives date of edition and page number, and sometimes book size, for his citations or quotations, one must conclude either that he had the very books or that he had copied down the information elsewhere. Given his solitary bent, the former explanation is infinitely more plausible. Since he led the retired life of a country gentleman, he almost surely had little access to libraries other than his own. Although Betley was a market town and Tollet might have picked up bargains from itinerant booksellers, he must have accumulated the greatest part of his collection in the Cambridge and London years. From the corpus of over 400 notes one could very reasonably characterize Tollet not only as a bookish man, for he definitely was that, but also as a man who knew something about a good many subjects. His knowledge of law might be taken for granted, and so, too, possibly, his acquaintance with many aspects of country life—husbandry, botany, hunting, natural history, and local history. One would expect him to be familiar with the Bible, and he was. He evidently knew something about heraldry, and was much interested in antiquities. He was fairly wellread in poetry, largely English poetry of the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries. Since primary interest focuses upon Tollet as a commentator on Shakespeare, it is almost mandatory to begin reconstructing his library by listing editions of Shakespeare and works on Shakespeare mentioned by him. Next in order would be dramatic literature, especially that contemporary with Shakespeare's plays. He had evidently steeped himself in Shakespeare's plays, for there are more than thirty cross-references to various of the plays in his notes. Of editions he had the First Folio, a quarto edition of The Merry Wives of Windsor , and probably Rowe's or Pope's Shakespeare , since he quotes from the Sonnets and from Lucrece , and there were five editions of the poems available to him in Rowe or Pope up to 1728. The next edition of the poems was in 1771. I do not believe he had a copy of Theobald's edition, for in at least two notes (II. 420.5 and 504.2) 1 Tollet offers, presumably as original, information already in Theobald. The number of times he quotes or cites Johnson makes it quite clear that he had one of the two 1765 editions or the third edition of 1768, the three editions being virtually the same. He had Richard Warner's Letter to David Garrick with its plan of a glossary (1768), Zachary Grey's Critical, Historical, and Explanatory Notes on Shakespeare (2 vols., 1754), Benjamin Heath's Revisal of Shakespeare's Text (1765), and Francis Peck's New Memoirs of Milton (1740) with its notes on Shakespeare. 2 He had Ben Jonson's Works in Peter Whalley's edition, but not very much else in Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatic literature, although references to The Two Noble Kinsmen and to The Tamer Tam'd might be taken to mean that he had an edition of Beaumont and Fletcher. He had Philip Massinger's The Picture , George Chapman's Widow's Tears , and Frances Quarles's Virgin Widow . He had, knew, or had seen George Farquhar's The Beaux Stratagem . Not a very impressive body of dramatic literature. Shakespeare's great contemporary in poetry is represented by eight quotations or references; these include The Shepherd's Calendar and Colin Clout's Come Home Again , as well, of course, as The Fairy Queen . Tollet quotes or cites Chaucer fairly often, in one note giving a reference to Urry's edition. Twice he quotes Sidney's Astrophel and Stella , and he knew the poetry of Hoccleve, Fairfax's Tasso , Daniel, Drayton (both the Polyolbion and Ideas ), and Milton. He quotes only from Lycidas , but he had an edition of the prose works of 1738. He also owned a copy of George Pettie's Petite Palace of Pettie his Pleasure . What modern poets he possessed or favored it is difficult to say, as he quotes only Hudibras , in Zachary Grey's edition, and Pope—the second Epilogue to the Satires and the translation of the Iliad . Prose writers in Tollet's library roughly contemporary with Shakespeare were Bacon, Sidney (the Arcadia ), Ascham (in the edition nominally by Bennet but actually by Samuel Johnson), and Sir William Cornwallis's Essays , 1601. Of continental writers he quotes Montaigne, a writer one would expect him to know, and Henri Estienne's (or Étienne's) semi-satirical work Apologie pour Hérodote , 1566, a work he might very easily not be expected to know. Both are quoted in English translation, the latter from an edition of 1607. Classical literature, other than certain works such as Pliny and Tacitus which fall into special categories, is confined to Ovid, both in a Latin edition and in George Sandys's translation of the Metamorphoses , and a reference to and a quotation from Plutarch, presumably in North's translation. Except, then, for James Howell's Epistolae Ho — Elianae and Chesterfield's Letters , all the other books in Tollet's library can be pretty well classified under about nine general headings, always leaving a final category for miscellaneous, usually single, pieces. A prospective editor of Shakespeare obviously needed dictionaries and glossaries, and more than just those in English. Whether Tollet had them, or, once dedicated to explicating Shakespeare, he bought them directly or ordered from his London bookseller, he had a fair collection. In alphabetical order, he quotes or cites from Robert Ainsworth's Thesaurus linguae Latinœ Compendiarus (1736), Nathan Bailey's Dictionarium Britanicum (1730, the most commonly used English dictionary before Dr. Johnson's, an edition of which Tollet also had), Abel Boyer's Dictionnaire François-Anglais (1699), Randle Cotgrave's Dictionarie of the French and English tongues (1611), John Cowell's The Interpreter, containing the general signification of such obscure words and terms as are used either in the common or statute laws of this kingdom (1607, expeditiously referred to as Cowell's Law Dictionary ), the Dictionarium rusticum, urbanicum, and botanicum, or a dictionary of husbandry, gardening, trade, commerce, and all sorts of country affairs (1704, attributed to Nathan Bailey), Junius's Etymologicum Anglicanum (either in the 1677 edition or that edited by Edward Lye in 1743), John Minsheu's Guide into tongues (1617), William Somners's Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum (1659), Stephen Skinner's Etymologicon Lingua Anglicanae (1667), and Sir Henry Spelman's Glossarium archaiologicum (1664). He also had a copy of George Hickes's Grammatica anglo-saxonica (1711). Tollet was well read in history, especially English history. Before cataloguing the works on English history in his library, it may be well to dispatch the others. He cites Herodotus in one note and quotes Sir Henry Savile's The ende of Nero and beginning of Galla, fower bookes of the histories of Tacitus . The life of Agricola (1591) in another. John Steevens's General History of Spain (1699), translated from Juan de Mariana, had a place on his bookshelves, as did John Bulteel's translation of François Eudes de Mézeray's history of France, Englished as A General Chronological History of France (3 vols., 1683). Close by Mézeray would be The Memoirs of Philippe de Comines ( seigneur d'Argenton ) translated by D. Godefroy (1674). English chronicles and histories in his possession were Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1577), which he quotes or cites twenty-nine times; John Stow's Summarie of Englyshe chronicles (1565), his Annales of England (1592), as well as his Survay of London (1598). He had John Speed's History of Great Britain (1611), Thomas Langley's translation of Polydore Vergil (1546), John Rous's (or Ross's), Historia Regum Angliae (a fifteenth-century work edited by Thomas Hearne in 1716), Joshua Barnes's History of . . . Edward III (1688), Fuller's History of the Worthies of England (1661), Robert Sheringham's De Anglorum gentis origine disceptatio (1670), Sir Richard Cox's Hibernia Anglicana; or the history of Ireland from the conquest there of by the English to this present time (1689-90), and Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes's, Annals of Scotland (1776). Thomas Hearne's Liber Niger Scaccarii, Wilhelmique etiam Worcestrii Annales Rerum Anglicanum (2 vols., 1728) would have been in close proximity to Francis Peck's Desiderata Curiosa (2 vols., 1732-5), a collection of tracts, letters, memoirs and other documents dealing with English history from 1558 to 1660. At some time or other when he was in London he must have visited the British Museum to consult Sir Symonds D'Ewes's "Journals of all the Parliaments during the Reign of Queen Elizabeth," Harleian MSS. 481-484, for he quotes from them in a note in 1778 and they were not published until after 1780. Tollet's close familiarity with English history is exemplified in one note on 3 Henry VI where the Duke of York enters to his sons Edward and Richard and to the Marquess of Montague and addresses them as "sons and brother." Steevens proposed to read "cousin" for "brother," after the quarto, and pointed out that the expression "brother of the war" occurs in King Lear . Johnson inclined to "sons and brothers," i.e., as he put it, "my sons , and brothers to each other." But Tollet defended the old reading: This is right. In the two succeeding pages York calls Montague brother . This may be in respect to their being brothers of the war , as Mr. Steevens observes, or of the same council as in K. Henry VIII who says to Cranmer, "You are a brother of us." Mountague [sic] was brother to Warwick; Warwick's daughter was married to a son of York: Therefore York and Montague were brothers. But as this alliance did not take place during the life of York, I embrace Mr. Steevens's interpretation rather than suppose that Shakespeare made a mistake about the time of the marriage (VI. 442.2). Another part of Tollet's collection was devoted to local histories, travel, and antiquities. Robert Plot's Natural History of Staffordshire (1686) was cited or quoted four times in Tollet's notes; in two others he remarks on Staffordshire customs and dialect, explaining in the first how the Staffordshire poor go from parish to parish on All-Saints-Day " a souling , as they call it, i.e. begging and puling (or singing small . . .) for soul-cakes " and quoting Staffordshire dialect to exemplify the meaning of "sag" as "to sink down by its own weight, or by an overload" (I. 142.6 and IV. 592.7). Tollet also had Plot's Natural History of Oxfordshire (1677), Sir William Dugdale's Antiquities of Warwickshire Illustrated (1656), Charles Smith's Antient and present state of the county and city of Waterford in the edition of 1774, and John Wallis's Natural History and Antiquities of Northumberland (2 vols., 1769). To these one must add Martin Martin's Description of the Western Islands of Scotland (1703), Richard Carew's History of Cornwall (1602, referred to in three notes), and John Norden's Speculi Britanniae pars ; a topographicall and chorographicall description of Cornwall (1610). Tollet used Carew's Survey to adduce parallels to "corporals of the field" in Love's Labour's Lost (1773, II. 382.4) and "potch" in Coriolanus (VII. 368.2) and to explain "to cry hold" in Macbeth (IV. 608.7). Norden's History of Cornwall , as Tollet refers to it, affords him a quotation in explication of the "third borough" in the Introduction to The Taming of the Shrew : "A third borough seems originally to have signified him who had the principal government within his own tything , or trithing . Norden's Hist. of Cornwall , decides for the former word tithing . See p. 29, 30. 'The shirife has his bayliwickes; the hundreds have constables, tythings have therdbarows , in some places hed-burows, in some borrowshed, and in the west partes, a tythngman'" (III. 397.8). Five times in a long note in 1778 on the Morris dancers in 1 Henry IV and twice elsewhere in the same edition Tollet quotes or cites Olaus Magnus's well-known work, the Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalius (1555), translated as A Compendious History of the Goths, Swedes, and Vandals, and other Northern Nations in 1658. He had Magellan's Voyages , Columbus's Voyages , and George Sandys's Travels , as that work came to be titled from 1658 on. What I have rather loosely described as antiquities was represented by such works as John Weever's Ancient Funeral Monuments (1631) and John Leland's De rebus Britannicis collectanea , originally published in 1552, but edited by Thomas Hearne in six volumes in 1715, with a new edition, also in six volumes, in 1770. Tollet, who cites or quotes the Collectanea seven times in his notes, was sufficiently fond of the book as to have both modern editions. He also had Leland's Itinerary , edited by Thomas Hearne in nine volumes (1710-12, 1744, and 1770). Still another work of Thomas Hearne's in Tollet's library was A Letter containing an account of some antiquities between Windsor and Oxford published in the Monthly Miscellany , Nov. 1708-Jan. 1709, and reprinted in 1725. In a note in the 1773 Appendix Tollet explained the "shealed peascods" in King Lear but gave no authority for his explanation; in 1778 he added in evidence page numbers to two editions of William Camden's Remains of a greater work concerning Britain (1657 and 1674). Camden's Britannia (1586) was invoked once in the notes. Tollet also owned a copy of a book which was the subject of correspondence between such scholars as Bishop Percy and Thomas Warton; this was Robert Laneham's Letter , whose long full title has to do with some entertainment offered Queen Elizabeth at Kenilworth Castle in 1575 during her summer's progress. Three other works round out the antiquities: Richard Verstegan's Restitution of decay'd Intelligence: in Antiquities (1605); Bernard de Mountfaucon's Antiquity explained and represented in sculpture , thus the title in the English translation by D. Humphreys (five volumes with a supplement of another five volumes, 1721-5); and Johan Gregor Keysler's Antiquitates Selectae Septentrionales et Celticae (1720), Englished as Northern and Celtic Antiquities and a companion volume to Olaus Magnus's work mentioned shortly above. The number of works of husbandry Tollet possessed invites conjecture as to the extent to which he may have put them to practical use himself. He had as nucleus for this part of his library several works of that remarkable literary Jack-of-all-trades Gervase Markham, one of the earliest and most prolific of English professional writers and compilers. These were Markham's Farewell to Husbandry (1620), The English Husbandman (1635), A Discourse of Horsemanship (1593, 1595), Country Contentments (1615), The Pleasures of Princes . . . containing a Discourse on the Art of Fishing with an Angle (1614), and The Whole Art of Husbandry (1634), this last being a revised and enlarged edition of Barnaby Googe's English translation (1577) of Conrad Heresbach's Rei Rusticae libri quator (Cologne, 1570). Tollet quoted Markham's edition of the Maison Rustique (1616), a translation of an earlier work by Charles Estienne, in one note and a work he calls simply Husbandry and dates as 1631 in two others. This is almost surely Markham's Cheap and Good Husbandry , first published in 1614, in its reprinting in A Way to Get Health (1631), a compilation of some of his earlier pieces. 3 Markham's volumes were buttressed by Thomas Tusser's Five hundred points of husbandry (1557), either John Fitzherbert's New Tract or treatise . . . for all husband men (1523) or his Book of Husbandry (1534), Samuel Harlib's Legacy: or an enlargement of the Discourse of Husbandry (1651), Leonard Mascall's The first (second, third) book of cattle (1587), and either Walter Blithe's The English Improver, or a New Survey of Husbandry (1649) or the same author's The English Improver Improved, or the Survey of Husbandry Surveyed (1652). Tollet brought to Steevens's attention Thomas Powell's Human Industry, or a History of Most Manual Arts (1661) and thus enabled the latter to correct an error he had made in the 1773 edition. At another juncture he was able to explain Duke Orsino's exclamation upon seeing Viola-Cesario and her brother Sebastian together, "a natural perspective, that is, and is not!," by reference to that same work (V. 173.1). Because they are allied to this group of works, Aristotle's De generatione animalium , Bacon's Natural History , Henry Lyte's New herbal, or history of plants (1578, invoked four times), and Philemon Holland's translation of Pliny (1601), quoted or cited eleven times, making it one of Tollet's favorite reference books, should be given adjacent shelf space. There are four notes dealing with falconry, hunting, and dogs. Hamlet's reference to "French falconers" in his welcome to the players prompted Tollet to call Steevens's attention to " Sir Tho. Browne's Tracts , p. 116" for the information that "the French seem to have been the first and noblest falconers in the western part of Europe" and that the French king sent his own falconers over "to shew that sport to King James the first" (1778, X. 261.8). Twice Tollet turned to Turberville's Book of Hunting , once to cite him on bear hunting (1778, III. 96.2) and once to quote the 1575 edition in explication of Gads-hill's reference to "great oneyers; such as can hold in; such as will strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than drink." The note reads: "Turbervile's Book on Hunting , 1575, p. 37, mentions huntsmen on horseback to make young hounds ' hold in and close' to the old ones: so Gads-hill may mean, that he is joined with such companions as will hold in , or keep and stick close to one another, and such as are men of deeds, and not of words; and yet they love to talk and speak their mind freely better than to drink" (V. 298.5). When Prince Hal, in the same play, says of the presumptively dead Falstaff, "Death hath not struck so fat a deer today," Tollet quoted Turberville's Terms of the Ages of all Beasts of Venery and Chase in defence of "fat" as opposed to the quartos' "fair" (V. 420.1). Tollet's knowledge of hunting is further exemplified in a note on Rosencrantz's use of the verb "to cote," for he quoted the "laws of coursing" to the effect that "a cote is when a greyhound goes endways by the side of his fellows, and gives the hare a turn" (X. 252.8). And in the following note, on "Brach Merriman" in The Taming of the Shrew , quoted in full, we learn of two more books in Tollet's library: It feems from the commentary of Ulitius upon Gratius , from Caius de Canibus Britannicis , from bracco , in Spelman's Gloſſary , and from Markham's Country Contentments , that brache originally meant a bitch. Ulitius , p. 163, obferves, that bitches have a ſuperior fagacity of noſe, "fœminis [canibus] ſagacitatis plurimum ineſſe, uſus docuit;" and hence, perhaps, any hound with eminent quickneſs of ſcent, whether dog or bitch, was called brache , for the term brache is fometimes applied to males. Our anceſtors hunted much with the large ſouthern hounds, and had in every pack a couple of dogs peculiarly good and cunning to find game, or recover the ſcent, as Markham informs us. To this cuſtom Shakeſpeare ſeems here to allude, by naming two braches , which, in my opinion, are beagles; and this diſcriminates brache from the lym , a blood-hound mentioned together with it, in the tragedy of King Lear . In the following quotation offered by Mr. Steevens on another occaſion, the brache hunts truely by the ſcent, behind the doe, while the hounds are on every ſide: "For as the dogs purſue the ſilly doe, "The brache behind, the hounds on every ſide; "So trac'd they me among the mountains wide." Phaer's Legend of Owen Glendower (pp. 400-01) Caius is Dr. John Caius; Ulitius upon Gratius is Jan Van Vliet's Autores rei venaticœ antiqui . Cum commentariis Jani Vlitii (1653), the section on Grattius "Faliscus's" poem Cynegetica on hunting, especially with dogs. Tollet, it will be recalled, was called to the bar in 1751. Hence, he would be expected to know some law. One of his dictionaries, already mentioned, was John Cowell's The Interpreter , loosely referred to as Cowell's Law Dictionary . There are nine references that I would term legal references, exclusive of those which refer to Cowell, in Tollet's notes. Most of these are to statutes. Thus, Pistol's "faitors" in 2 Henry IV is, according to Tollet, a word "used in the statute 7 Rich . II. c.5, for evil doers, or rather for idle livers" (V. 500.7). Similar references to a specific statute occur in one other note and a general reference to "several old statutes" in still another. He knew that there was "a penalty of ten shillings in one of king Alfred's ecclesiastical laws, if one opprobriously shave a common man like a fool ," thus explaining somebody's being nicked with scissors "like a fool" in The Comedy of Errors , an allusion whose "force" Steevens was "unable to explain" (II. 237.5). He agreed with Johnson that "extend," as used in Antony and Cleopatra ("extended Asia"), was a term for "to seize," but he went further and said it was "a law term used for to seize lands and tenements," quoted " Savile's Translation of Tacitus " in support, and concluded by quoting a parallel usage in As You Like It as evidence that Shakespeare "knew the legal signification of the term" (VIII. 133.5). Iago's reference to the magnifico's having "a voice potential / As double as the duke's" elicited a long note by Johnson, a lawyer manqué, who wrote, in part, that "in our courts, the chief justice and one of the inferior judges prevail over the other two, because the chief justice has a double voice." Tollet wrote, "I believe here is a mistake. The chief justice and one of the inferior judges do not prevail over the other two. The lord mayor in the court of alderman has a double voice" (X. 442.9). Tollet was declared correct by one who could be considered the final authority, for in Malone's Supplement (1780) Sir William Blackstone declared that "the chief justice has no double voice. If the court is equally divided, nothing is done" (I. 364). Sir John Hawkins would naturally know much more law than Johnson, but when he cited "a statute of the 21st of James I to reform prophane cursing and swearing" Tollet reminded him that he "should have referred to the statute of the 3d of James I. c. 21 which lays a penalty for the profane use of the name of God, etc. in stage-plays, enterludes, May-games, etc." (X. 606.2). Tollet, surely because of the Morris dancers and the May pole depicted in his stained glass window, had made himself quite an expert on the subject of May games and in his dissertation on those figures on his window he could therefore refer to "an ordinance of the Rump Parliament in April 1644" which caused all May-poles to be taken down and removed by the proper authorities (V. 431). Finally, insofar as his knowledge of legal matters is concerned, and here it was tied in with his knowledge of English history, when the Duke of Buckingham in Henry VIII refers to himself as "poor Edward Bohun" after his trial, he was again able to correct Steevens who stated that "the duke of Buckingham's name was Stafford, Shakespeare was led into the mistake by Holinshed." Tollet's note reads, in part: "This is not an expression thrown out at random, or by mistake, but one strongly marked with historical propriety. The name of the duke of Buckingham most generally known, was Stafford ; but the Hist. of Remarkable Trials , 8vo. 1715, p. 170, says: 'it seems he affected that surname [of Bohun ] before that of Stafford , he being descended from the Bohuns , earls of Hereford" (VII. 221.7). The work quoted is The History of Remarkable Trials . Faithfully extracted from records and other authentick authorities as well MS as printed . Shakespeare is thus acquitted of having made a mistake, whether he was aware of it or not. The Queen in Cymbeline describes England as "Neptune's park, ribbed and paled / With rocks unscaleable," Sir Thomas Hanmer's emendation of "oaks unscaleable." Tollet supported the emendation with an apposite quotation "from Chapter 109 of Bariffe's Military Discipline , 1639, seemingly from Tooke's Legend of Britomart " (IX. 239.2), thus betraying another of his areas of interest. The full titles of the books are Military Discipline, or the Young Artillery Man (1638), by William Bariffe, and The Legend of Brita-mart: otherwise Britaines Mars; or A paraphrase upon our provisionall martiall discipline , by George Tooke (1635). Why Tollet had these works and four or five more that deal with military matters will probably always remain a mystery, but he may simply have inherited them as part of his father's library, the elder Tollet having been a Commissioner of the Navy. In any event, he also had W. G.'s quarto translation of a work by Count Ernst von Mansfield titled, in the English version, Count Mansfield's Directions of War (1624), a book he cited in his dissertation on the Morris dancers (V. 431n.). Lewis Theobald had explained an heraldic allusion in Love's Labour's Lost by recourse to Gerard Leigh's Accidence of Armourie (1597); Tollet, probably ignorant of Theobald's note, had recourse to the same work, quoting the pertinent words and giving a page reference (II. 504.2), having earlier in the same play quoted Leigh's Accidence for the spelling of "several" (II. 407.3). Bellay's Instructions for the War , so Englished by Paul Ive in 1589, was quoted in explication of Lady Macbeth's "To cry, hold , hold ," and from Thomas Birch's edition of Sir Walter Raleigh's Works (2 vols., 1751) Tollet remembered two references to "corporals of the field." 4 Akin to these works more than to any other definable category of books in his library is John Selden's The Duello, or Single Combat (1610). Tollet quotes or cites the Bible five times in the 1778 Shakespeare , three of the five being from St. Matthew and one from Acts, in "the old version of the New Testament." In the fifth note, on the "shard-borne beetle" in Macbeth , part of a long defence of the interpretation "the shard-born [sic] beetle is born in dung," in which Aristotle, Pliny, Drayton, Jonson, A petite Palace of Pettie his Pleasure , Bacon's Natural History , and Much Ado About Nothing are all quoted or cited, Tollet also cited " his [Shakespeare's] Bible, or the old translation of the Bible" as authority for the spelling "borne" to mean "brought forth" (IV. 532.5). The only other religious works he had occasion to refer to were Juan Luis Vives's De instructione feminœ christianœ (1523), translated by Richard Hyde as The Instruction of a Christian Woman (1540), of which he had an edition of 1592, and Thomas Adams's Spiritual Navigator (1615). Constance's reference to the devil's appearing "in likeness of a new untrimmed bride" in King John brought an emendation from Theobald, an absurd explanation from Warburton, a distortion of Johnson's risible muscles, four parallels for the meaning "undrest" from Steevens, and a quotation from Vives's work from Tollet in support of the meaning "not finely dressed or attired" or indicating "a deshabille or a frugal vesture" (V. 61.4). Tollet also remembered encountering "Hirens" in Adams's Spiritual Navigator and offered this bit of knowledge to Steevens in evidence that "Hirens" were, in Adams's words, "in plain English, harlots" (V. 500.8). Everybody in the eighteenth century with any pretensions to learning seems to have had some knowledge of heraldry. Tollet was no exception. The king in Love's Labour's Lost speaks of "beauty's crest" which "becomes the heavens well." Warburton, as usual, saw the need to emend, being dissatisfied with "crest"; Johnson attempted explication; Tollet stated that "crest" meant "the very top , the height of beauty" and adduced a convincing parallel from King John . He further remarked that "in heraldry, a crest is a device placed above a coat of arms" (II. 458.2). The use of the word "cognizance" in 1 Henry VI gave Tollet opportunity to call upon his knowledge of heraldry again, as he explained that "the cognisance is seated upon the most eminent part of the helmet; and by a designed blunder in Ben Jonson's works, 1750, Vol. I, p. 160 and Vol. VII, p. 356 is called a cullisen , which Mr. Whalley's Dictionaries or the heralds he consulted, could not explain" (VI. 219.7). Whalley's note on the word in its appearance in Every Man Out of His Humour reads, "No dictionary I can find will help us to the meaning of this word, nor does the context lead us to discover it." Tollet's library contained John Selden's Titles of Honour for the raised points of Coronets (1614); John Walker's The History of the Order of the Garter (1715), a continuation of Elias Ashmole The Institution, Laws and Ceremonies of the Order of the Garter (1672); and John Anstis's Observations Introductory to an Historical Essay upon the Knighthood of the Bath (1725). All three works were referred to in Tollet's long note on the Morris dancers. The miscellaneous works in Tollet's library are a curiously mixed lot. Had he not written the long note on the Morris dancers, we would not have known that he had a number of the works already discussed, the last three above, for example. Nor would we have known that he had Richard Haydocke's 1598 translation of an Italian work by G. P. Lomazzo, Tracte containing the artes of curious paintinge or a work entitled Sports or lawful Recreations upon Sunday after Evening-prayers, and upon Holy-days , published by king James in 1618, with its reference to "May-games, Morris dances, and the setting up of May-poles." Even more curious is a quotation from "the appendix to Bulwer's Artificial Changeling , for the book in question is John Bulwer's Anthropometamorphosis: Man Transformed: Or, the Artificial Changeling; hiſtorically prefented, in the mad and cruel Gallantry, foolifh Bravery, ridiculous Beauty, filthy Finenefs, and loathſome Lovelineſs of moſt Nations, faſhioning and altering their Bodies from the Mould intended by Nature; with Figures of thoſe Transfigurations. To which artificial and affected Deformations are added, all the native and national Monſtroſities that have appeared to disfigure the Human Fabrick. With a Vindication of the regular Beauty and Honeſty of Nature. And an Appendix of the Pedigree of the English Gallant. Scripſit, F. B. Cognomento Chiroſophus , M. D. Quarto, London 1653. Pages 559, beſides the Introduction, Table of Contents, &amp;c. (p. 364) Nothing but a full title could do justice to the contents of the book. 5 One of the passages in Shakespeare's plays that had exercised the critics was Hubert's description in King John of the tailor "standing on slippers (which his nimble hast / Had falsely thrust upon contrary Feet." Johnson asserted that "either shoe will equally admit either foot"; Farmer mustered three passages to show that Johnson was almost surely wrong; Steevens, never one to be outdone, added three more to Farmer's parallels; Tollet quoted Martin's Description of the Western Islands of Scotland and "the Philosophical Transactions abridged , vol. III. p. 432 and VII. p. 23, where are exhibited shoes and sandals shaped to the feet, spreading more to the outside than the inside" (V. 95.4). In another note he cited Dr. Lister's demonstration in the Philosophical Transactions "that what were vulgarly thought animated horse-hairs, are real insects," a handy recollection for the explication of Antony's reference to "the courser's hair" having life, and further evidence of Tollet's interest in scientific matters (VII. 138.6). A reference to "Pitt's Atlas , in Sweden, p. 20" (VII. 14.7) reveals that Tollet owned Moses Pitt's four-volume folio English Atlas (1680-83), which William Lowndes in his Bibliographer's Manual described as "formerly in great estimation, and still a curious book of reference." Finally, his library boasted copies of Henry Peacham's Compleat Gentleman (1622), Reginald Scot's Discovery of Witchcraft (1584), Sir Thomas Wotton's Elements of Architecture (1624) and Reliquiœ Wottonianae (1639). Rarer than any of these, and they were not especially rare at that time, was a work by José Teixeira entitled The Spanish Pilgrim, or an admirable discovery of a Romish Catholike in its English version by W. P. (1625). Richard Farmer had cited the title of a pamphlet, a " Treatise Parœnitical, wherein is shewed the right way to resist the Castilian king " in a note on the Host's calling Dr. Caius a "Castilian king" in the Merry Wives of Windsor ; Tollet seconded Farmer's belief that the term was "a popular slur upon the Spaniards, who were held in great contempt by the business of the Armada ," by extracting corroborating evidence "from an old pamphlet, called The Spanish Pilgrime , which I have reason to suppose is the same discourse with the Treatise Parœnetical , mentioned by Dr. Farmer" (I. 289.8). He was right, they were the same pamphlet. There are approximately 135 titles of books, plays, and pamphlets in Tollet's notes. Since he had the collected works of Jonson, Chaucer, Shakespeare, probably Beaumont and Fletcher, Bacon, Raleigh, Milton's prose, Pope's Iliad , and certain other works in multi-volumes, the actual number of volumes represented in the approximately 135 titles is quite a good deal greater. Whatever that number, however, it should surely be regarded as only part of his entire library, a library he put to effective use.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">William Cowper and the European Magazine by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Number 53 in the catalogue of Cowper's library, printed in Appendix A of Thomas Wright's life of the poet (London, 1892), is "European Magazine, 1789," and the question naturally arises, Why did Cowper have a single volume of this periodical? He had sixteen volumes of the Gentleman's Magazine , nineteen volumes of the Monthly Review , and twenty-seven volumes of the Analytical Review . To the first he contributed poems and prose pieces and to the third a number of reviews. Biographies of Cowper and the superb Bibliography of William Cowper to 1837 by Norma Russell, published in 1963, make no mention of any contributions to the European Magazine , for it has gone unnoticed that seven of Cowper's poems were printed in it. Three poems were printed in the April issue: "Song. By Mr. Cowper. The poplars are fell'd . . ."; "On the Death of a Lady's Bullfinch. By the Same"; and "The Dog and the Waterlilly. No Fable. By the Same." (pp. 330-331). The Poplar-Field had been printed in January 1785 in the Gentleman's Magazine (p. 53), and the version in the European Magazine follows that text but with two substantive differences. Line 4 in the GM reads "Nor Ouse in its bosom their image receives"; in the 1800 Poems it reads "Nor Ouse on his bosom their image receives"; but in the EM it reads "Nor the Ouse on its surface their image receives." Line 14 reads, respectively as above: "And I must alas! long lie as lowly as they," "And I must ere long lie as lowly as they," "And I must myself lie as lowly as they." These seem hardly to be errors of transcription. The EM text of the bullfinch poem also follows the text of that poem as it appeared in the GM for February 1789 (pp. 163-164), with differences in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. There is one palpable error, "arose" for "arise" in line 17, and there are the following differences, with the GM text first: hunger's cruel rage / cruel Hunger's rage (l. 5), Of which / With which (l. 29), explore / t'explore (l. 38). Further, the EM version omits the entire penultimate stanza. It should be remarked that the EM 's "With which" of line 29 is the accepted reading. It is worth noting that the GM version bears the epigraph, "Lugete o Veneris Cupidinesque," nowhere else present in reprintings of the poem. The Dog and the Water Lily , according to the Oxford Cowper and to Norma Russell, was first published in the GM for December 1791 (p. 1143), although in fact it first appeared in the EM in April 1789. The EM text is, therefore, of more than cursory interest. I omit differences in punctuation, etc. in what follows. The received text (Oxford, 1934) is first: his race / its race (l. 5), found for / gave to (l. 8), swallow / Swallows (l. 11), windings / winding (l. 28), finish'd / ended (l. 29), wreath / flower (l. 31). I defer my conclusions. In May 1789 the EM printed "The Morning Dream. By W. Cowper, Esq." (pp. 414-415), the poem having previously appeared in the November 1788 GM (pp. 1008-09). There are thirteen substantive differences between the two texts, seven of the readings in the EM agreeing with the 1800 Poems text. The remaining six readings are identical in the GM and the 1800 Poems . Respectively, then, GM , EM , and 1800: Sweet / glad / glad (l. 1), dreamt / dream'd / dream'd (ll. 3,5), bore / wore / wore (l. 10), ne'er / never / ne'er (l. 12), a / the / a (l. 14), sung / sang / sang (l. 19), T'was / It was / T'was (l. 24), a / the / the (l. 29), that / which / that (l. 39), But / When / But (l. 43), for / as / for (l. 44), Ruler / rulers / rulers (l. 47). The Lily and the Rose , published in the 1782 Poems , was reprinted in the EM for June (p. 496). Four substantive differences are present, the first reading being from the EM : cruel / civil (l. 17), said she / she said (l. 21), both / each (l. 24), loveliest / fairest (l. 26). The "loveliest" of the EM text violates the metrical pattern of the poem, but does away with the repetition in "The fairest British fair." One wonders if the EM 's "cruel," instead of "civil," in "This civil bick'ring and debate," is not more consonant with the Rose's "redden[ing] into rage" (l. 9). Two poems remain, both printed in the July EM (pp. 63-4): "The Queen's Visit to London. On the 17th of March 1789. By W. Cowper, Esq." and "On the Benefit said to be already received by his Majesty from Sea-Bathing." Charles Ryskamp has called attention to pre-1815 printings of the latter poem, and the EM text follows that of the Whitehall Evening-Post in the July 16-18 number. 1 It, unlike the other six poems printed in the EM , cannot gain entry into that part of Norma Russell's bibliography of pieces "Published for the first time, or published with variant readings in periodicals." The other poem, the Queen's Visit to London , is particularly interesting for, while it was written in March 1789 on a matter of national concern, its first publication has hitherto thought to have been by William Hayley in the posthumous 1803 edition of Cowper's poems. However, in the 1815 Poems edited by the Reverend John Johnson, the poem on the Queen's visit was printed from an unpublished manuscript, or so it has been thought. But I believe, on the evidence of the textual differences in five of the six poems already discussed, and on the fact that two readings in the EM poem on the Queen's visit are also in the "unpublished" manuscript, that Cowper himself provided the texts of the six poems for printing in the EM . Here are the textual differences between the EM text of this last poem and that of the Hayley edition of 1803, with the EM readings first: his / her (l. 5), terms of that / aenigmatic (l. 49), those / that (l. 58), wonder in a / wonders in her (l. 63), brilliant / sparkling (l. 74). The EM readings in ll. 5 and 58 are those of the MS and 1815; the other EM variants are such as to preclude the probability of errors of transcription. I should add that EM omits the entire fifth stanza found in other versions. From its inception in 1782 until well beyond 1789 the EM was guided, but not (he insisted) edited, by Isaac Reed. Cowper is not mentioned in Reed's extant diaries, edited by Claude E. Jones, 2 and hence it is purely fanciful to imagine Reed, even though at the center of the literary and scholarly world of London, soliciting contributions from the poet. But there are the seven poems, six of them with significant textual variants, and there is number 53 in the catalogue of Cowper's library (part or full payment for those contributions?). Future editors of Cowper's poems will have to decide for themselves how they will treat the EM texts. What is more, a small addition to Norma Russell's bibliography is in order. A certain Matthew Knapp, animadverting on a number of contributions to the GM , 3 concluded by writing, "I send you the following epitaph on a tomb in the churchyard of Newport Pagnell, in Bucks, as it is the production of the celebrated author of 'The Task,' &amp;c." He then quoted Cowper's tenline epitaph on T. A. Hamilton. The Oxford Cowper (p. 386) gives the first printing as 1800, and the appearance of the epitaph in the GM is not noted by Norma Russell. In her bibliography she records the presence of the poem in the volume of Cowper's translations from the French of Mme de la Motte Guyon, published by Cowper's friend the Reverend William Bull in 1801 at Newport Pagnell. Miss Russell's footnote on the epitaph reads, in part, "Bull states in the preface that it had appeared in a 'periodical publication.' This has eluded me. It did not appear in the G.M. until after it had been published by Bull" (p. 185). Possibly the fact that the poem did not appear in the poetry section of the GM accounts for Miss Russell's failure to trace it. Except for differences in capitalization and punctuation the GM text differs from the Oxford text in printing "A heart" in l. 6 for "An heart." I believe that the poem "The Question Answered," printed in the GM (1788, i. 542-543) and following two poems by Cowper, might have been included in Miss Russell's bibliography in the section entitled "Answers to Cowper" (pp. 282-283). The poem answers Cowper's question in The Task , "Would I describe a preacher such as Paul," the passage ending with the line, "Behold the picture—is it like?—like whom?" I am somewhat surer that the translations of the mottoes to the five Connoisseur essays (111, 115, 119, 134, 138) generally accepted as Cowper's, ought to be printed in a complete edition of his poetry and should also find a place in the bibliography under "Translations." The translations are, in order, of Horace's Odes , I. xxiii, 11; III. vii. 1; of Terence's Eunuchus , I. ii. 25; of Horace's Odes , III. vi. 1; and of Juvenal's sixth Satire, 1. 452. 4 A poem on Cowper by Richard Polewhele (a sufficiently important figure to be noted as writing a poem on Cowper) is in GM , 1795, ii. 600 but is not in Russell's bibliography in the pertinent section of poems on Cowper.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">William Blake's Techniques of Engraving and Printing by G. E. Bentley, Jr. *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William Blake was apprenticed as an engraver on 4 August 1772 and served a seven year term under James Basire, one of the most successful engravers of the time. Basire's speciality was reproducing drawings of architecture and sculpture in works such as Stuart &amp; Revett's Antiquities of Athens Measured and Delineated (1762-1816), [Richard Gough's] Sepulchral Monuments in Great Britain (1786, 1796), and Jacob Bryant's Analysis of Ancient Mythology (1774, 1776), and Blake worked on these and other learned volumes of the time during his apprenticeship. He was meticulously taught all the conventional skills of his craft while he lived with Basire, and he always defended his master vigorously: "Woolett did not know how to put so much labour into a head or a foot as Basire did". 1 By 1809 he could say truly in his Prospectus for his Chaucer engraving, "Mr. B. is an old well-known and acknowledged Engraver", and he was rightly confident of his ability: "I defy any Man to Cut Cleaner Strokes than I do or rougher where I please" ( Notebook , p. 25). "If a man is master of his profession, he cannot be ignorant that he is so . . . ." 2 Blake had mastered the various standard reproductive techniques of his time, in line-engraving (e.g., Job [1826]), stipple (Flaxman's Hesiod [1817]), etching (the first state of the plate after Hogarth for Gay's Beggar's Opera [1790]), and wood engraving (Virgil [1821]), and, had his character been different, he might well have been President of the Chalcographical Society, as was his sometime fellow apprentice and partner James Parker. He also experimented vigorously with the new techniques such as lithography, which was introduced into England about 1803—his "Enoch" lithograph was probably made about 1807—and he adapted and invented a number of techniques for his own purposes. Blake would have been remembered as a chalcographical innovator, even had he not been a great engraver, designer, colourist—and poet. The purpose of what follows is primarily to lay forth the contemporary verbal evidence about Blake's engraving and copperplate-printing techniques. Not long after he was out of his apprenticeship indentures in 1779, Blake began experimenting with reproductive techniques. The subject was much in the air at the time: in France and England Franz Ignaz Joseph Hoffman and Alexander Tilloch were making experiments, and Blake's friend George Cumberland wrote excitedly to his brother about his discoveries and published them as his "New Mode of Engraving", New Review , IV (Nov 1784), summarized in the European Magazine (1784). Cumberland's discovery was that the relatively simple technique of etching designs could be adapted by amateurs to etching texts ; the chief drawback, a relatively minor one Cumberland thought, was that the text would ordinarily be printed backwards and could be read easily only with a mirror. In Cumberland's technique, it was the dark lines which were etched and printed. Blake's technique of Illuminated Printing was a very considerable extension of Cumberland's and was probably made about the same time, for his Island in the Moon (?1784) evidently once had a passage describing a method of "Illuminating the [Engraved] Manuscript". Blake's method of Illuminated Printing differed in at least three important respects from Cumberland's: 1) The writing on the copper was put on in mirror-writing, so that it would print right-way round on the paper; 2) Designs were added to the text, so that the finished work was not just a different and inexpensive method of printing words but an almost entirely new technique uniting text and design which he called Illuminated Printing; 3) The etching was in relief (the reverse of the ordinary, intaglio, method), so that the ink is transferred from the raised surfaces rather from the recessed hollows. Thus an "O", for example, is made not by drawing or gouging a circle (as in intaglio etching) but by removing the outside and the hole, leaving a kind of volcano, the top of which prints the letter. All three techniques were in a sense commonplaces. Titles were regularly added in mirror-writing to engraved designs, and the ancient craft of woodcutting is essentially relief-engraving on wood. 3 Blake's genius lay largely in combining and perfecting the techniques for his own special purposes. In particular, he seems to have become extraordinarily skillful at mirror-writing, so that the etched words would come out right-way round when printed. His friend George Cumberland wrote in 1810 that " Blake . . . alone excels in that art" of reading, writing [and engraving] backwards, 4 and his disciple John Linnell commented after his death that "The most extraordinary facility seems to have been attained by Blake in writing backwards &amp; that with a brush dipped in a glutinous liquid". 5 Presumably all engravers were trained in mirror-writing, but few did so well or often. Note that the art of writing backwards on copper was a separate sub-division of the engraver's craft and that there were Writing Engravers such as William Staden Blake (fl. 1770-1817) who specialized in it. Frequently, probably normally, the design-engraver would turn his finished plate over to the publisher, who would then commission a Writing Engraver to add the lettering, including the title and the crucial imprint with the day of publication, e.g., "Published as the Act directs by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, 1 Jan. 1817". Blake, for instance, brought in his plates after Flaxman's Hesiod designs to Longman beginning in 1814, but it was not until 21 June 1816 that they paid £4.18 to "Jeffreys [ for adding ] Writing to 14 plate &amp;c.mmat; 7/.—" ( Blake Records , 579). However, Blake not only lettered all his own separate plates and works in Illuminated Printing, but he sometimes lettered his commercial plates for other men's books. For example, he wrote to Hayley on 16 March 1804 about his plate for the third volume of Hayley's Life . . . of William Cowper : "The inscriptions to the Plates I must beg of you to send to me that I may Engrave them immediately". This may, however, have been an exceptional case, because of Blake's friendship with Hayley. It seems likely that the inscriptions on most of Blake's commercial plates for books were made by other men. 6 The invention of Blake's method of Illuminated Printing was thus described by Blake's acquaintance of 1784, J. T. Smith: Blake, after deeply perplexing himself as to the mode of accomplishing the publication of his illustrated songs, without their being subject to the expense of letter-press, his brother Robert stood before him in one his visionary imaginations, 7 and so decidedly directed him in the way in which he ought to proceed, that he immediately followed his advice, by writing his poetry, and drawing his marginal subjects of embellishments in outline upon the copper-plate with an impervious liquid, 8 and then eating the plain parts or lights away with aquafortis considerably below them, so that the outlines were left as a stereotype. The plates in this state were then printed in any tint that he wished, to enable him or Mrs. Blake to colour the marginal figures up by hand in imitation of drawing ( Blake Records , 460). With this technique of Illuminated Printing, Blake produced almost all his published works, from Songs of Innocence (1789) and The Book of Thel (1789) to Jerusalem (1804-?20) and The Ghost of Abel (1822). So far as I know, the technique had never been used before Blake's time and has not been practised since. The most unusual feature of Blake's method was that he did not cover his plate with wax and cut away "the plain parts or lights"; instead he drew on the copper directly with a fast-drying liquid impervious to acid. The nature of this remarkable liquid is not known with confidence, though recent experiments by Professor Robert Essick indicate that it may have been either the usual stopping out varnish, "pitch . . . diluted with Terps", or some other comparatively common substance. Smith wrote that His method of eating away the plain copper, and leaving his drawn lines of his subjects and his words as stereotype, is in my mind perfectly original. Mrs. Blake is in possession of the secret, and she ought to receive something considerable for its communication, as I am quite certain it may be used to the greatest advantage, both to artists and literary characters in general. 9 Blake described his own techniques of engraving and printing a number of times, mostly for his friend the dilletante artist and inventor George Cumberland. He helped Cumberland with etching the designs for Cumberland's Thoughts on Outline (1796), and in a letter of 6 December 1795 he told him: As to laying on the Wax [ on the copper for etching ] it is as follows Take a cake of Virgins Wax (I dont know What animal produces it) 10 &amp; stroke it regularly over the surface of a warm Plate (the Plate must be warm enough to melt the Wax as it passes over), then immediately draw a feather over it &amp; you will get an even surface which when cold will receive any impression minutely[.] Cumberland was profoundly grateful for the assistance, and in the Thoughts on Outline he wrote: One thing may be asserted of this work, which can be said of few others that have passed the hands of an engraver, which is, that Mr. Blake has condescended to take upon him the laborious office of making them, I may say, fac-similes of my originals; a compliment, from a man of his extraordinary genius and abilities, the highest, I believe, I shall ever receive: — and I am indebted to his generous partiality for the instruction which encouraged me to execute a great part of the plates myself . . . . Blake made a memorandum in his Notebook (p. 4), perhaps at this time, about etching or engraving on relatively soft and cheap pewter (rather than copper), the technique being a standard one of transferring a pencil drawing, reversed, to the wax-covered plate; about white-line engraving on pewter; and about white-line etching on copper: Memorandum To Engrave on Pewter. Let there be first a drawing made correctly with black lead pencil. L et nothing be to seek, then rub it off on the plate covered with white wax [ as in the 1795 letter to Cumberland ] or perhaps pass it thro press. T his will produce certain &amp; determind forms on the plate &amp; time will not be wasted in seeking them afterwards. Memorandum To Woodcut on Pewter. L ay a ground on the Plate &amp; smoke it as for Etching. T hen trace your outlines [&amp; draw them in with a needle del ], and beginning with the spots of light on each object with an oval pointed needle scrape off the ground [&amp; instead of etching the shadowy strokes del ] as a direction for your graver then proceed to graving with the ground on the plate being as careful as possible not to hurt the ground because it being black will shew perfectly what is wanted [towards del ] Memorandum To Woodcut on Copper. Lay a ground as for Etching. T race &amp; c &amp; instead of Etching the blacks Etch the whites &amp; bite it in[.] Blake evidently told George Cumberland about this method of woodcutting on metal, for on the back of a letter of James Irvine of 16 December 1794 Cumberland made a memorandum about "Blakes metho d , biting whites". 11 Cumberland continued to be interested in Blake's methods of engraving. He evidently acquired one of the very few copies of Blake's lithograph of "Enoch" (?1807), and on the back of it he wrote down Blake's directions for making lithographs: White Lyas—is the Block[ ; ] draw with Ink composed of Asphaltum dissolved in dry Linseed Oil—add fine venetian Tripoli &amp; Rotten Stone Powder. Let it dry. W hen dry saturate the stone with water and Dab it with the broad Dabber, and cover it very thinly with best Printers Ink—and Print as a block— of Blake. 12 Lias is a limestone rock found in the South of England, which C. Hullmandel, The Art of Drawing on Stone (1824), 2, says "is too soft and porous" for printing, compared with the German lithographic stone. "Tripoli" or "Rotten Stone" is a fine earth used as a powder for polishing metals. The ink used here seems very unusual. Cumberland may well have followed these directions in the lithographs for his own Scenes, Chiefly Italian (1824). Blake seems actually to have recorded in print some of his inventions, though these may have now been lost. In his notebooks for 1804-8, Cumberland repeatedly made notes to himself: Qy who has Plates of the 12 good Rules by Blake lost[?] ( Blake Records , 118 n. 4, 119) These rules may well have been about engraving. Cumberland was anxious that the invention should be recorded in print, and in his notebook for the summer of 1807 he wrote that "Blake . . . intends to publish his new method through means[?] of stopping lights" ( Blake Records , 187). On 18 December 1808 he wrote to Blake: You talked also of publishing your new method of engraving—send it to me and I will do my best to prepare it for the Press.— P erhaps when done you might with a few specimens of Plates, make a little work for the subscribers of it—as Du Crow 13 did of his Aqua tinta—selling about 6 Pages for a guinea to non Subscribers—but if you do not chuse this method, we might insert it in [ William ] Nicholsons Journal [ of Natural Philosophy ] or the Monthly Magazine—with reference to you for explanations . . . ( Blake Records , 211-212). To this Blake replied on the 19th: I am very much obliged by your kind ardour in my cause &amp; should immediately Engage in reviewing my former pursuits of printing if I had not now so long been turned out of the old channel into a new one that it is impossible for me to return to it without destroying my present course[.] New Vanities or rather new pleasures occupy my thoughts[.] New profits seem to arise before me so tempting that I have already involved myself in engagements that preclude all possibility of promising any thing. I have however the satisfaction to inform you that I have Myself begun to print an account of my various Inventions in Art for which I have procured a Publisher &amp; am determind to pursue the plan of publishing what I may get printed without disarranging my time which in future must alone be devoted to Designing &amp; Painting[;] when I have got my Work printed I will send it you first of any body[.] Blake's inventions in engraving and printing are not known to have been published in 1809 or later, and Cumberland consequently noted eagerly other inventions which were like Blake's. On 22 January 1819 he wrote to his son: —Tell Blake a Mr Sivewright of Edinburgh has just claimed in some[?] Philosophical Journal of Last Month As his own invention Blakes Method—&amp; calls it Copper Blocks I think. 14 The method is apparently that of relief-etching on copper, about which Cumberland fairly obviously knew, and consequently it would be of very great interest to locate this note by Sivewright in a "Philosophical Journal". The author may be "John Sivewright, Teacher of Music" (c. 1770-1846) who wrote a Collection of Church Tunes &amp; Anthems (Edinburgh, c. 1805); he is probably the John Sievwright, Engraver, who appears in the Edinburgh city directories for 1805-15. 15 However, no article has been identified which corresponds to the one Cumberland described. His information may have come, perhaps through a friend, from 1) Anon., "Art. V—Account of a new Style of Engraving on Copper in Alto Relievo, invented by W[illiam Home] Lizars. Drawn up from information communicated by the Inventor", Edinburgh Philosophical Journal , II (April 1820), 19-23, in which Lizars says he "was much indebted" "during these experiments" to "Mr Sivright of Meggetland" (a suburb of Edinburgh), but he does not mention "Copper Blocks"; 2) The reprint of the bulk of Lizar's account in The Gentlemen's Magazine , XCI (1821), 625-6, citing " Edinburgh Philosophical Journal "; 3) Anon., "A New Style of Engraving, invented by Mr. Lizars", London Journal of Arts and Science , I (1820), 78-79, which does not refer to "Copper Blocks", Sivewright, or The Edinburgh Philosophical Journal ; and 4) Charles Pye, "Mr. Pye on Engraving on Metal and Stone. On a new Process of Engraving on Metal and Stone", London Journal of Arts and Sciences , I (1820), 55-58, which describes Pye's own experiments made "five years" earlier than the "account of the Process of Engraving on Copper Blocks into alto relievo by Mr. Lizars" "in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal", but which does not mention Mr Sivewright. None of these accounts mentions both "Copper Blocks" and Mr Sivewright, as Cumberland does. There is a further, chronological, difficulty, for all four of the articles were published in 1820 and 1821. 16 Without yet another date, after January 1819, for the obscured date-stamp in Cumberland's letter, or another, earlier account of Sivewright's Copper Blocks in some Philosophical Journal, we are left with a mystery as to where Cumberland found his information. Though we know a great deal on Blake's own authority about his methods of engraving, we still do not know with confidence about his method of reliefetching producing "Copper Blocks" as in stereotype for his works in Illuminated Printing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Blake's Printing Techniques Blake's techniques of printing are rather better known, partly because they are more conventional, partly because they are more easily visible in his surviving works. Blake bought a wooden press for printing engravings, perhaps with money he inherited when his father died in July 1784, and he probably used it in the print-selling business which he and his fellow-apprentice James Parker established beside Blake's birthplace at 27 Broad Street, Golden Square, London, in 1784-85. Certainly Blake had the press by 1800 when he moved to the little seaside village of Felpham in Sussex. He brought it back to London with him in September 1803, 17 and there were unsuccessful negotiations to sell it to J. Lahee in August 1827, just after Blake's death. We last hear of it when it was moved to John Linnell's house in Cirencester Place in 1827, when Catherine Blake moved there to be Linnell's housekeeper ( Blake Records , 29, 350-351, 461 n. 1). Blake was a master printer as well as engraver, and he took great care with his printing usually. Sometimes he masked the plate, so that only part of it would print, as in America pl. 4 and in many of the plates for the Small Book of Designs. Normally he wiped the border of the plate, and the presence or absence of this dark border is one of the ways of distinguishing between prints pulled by Blake and those made after his death by his disciple Frederick Tatham. He regularly printed in colours, brown, blue, green, red, orange, and yellow, as well as in black, and he invented a method, still little understood, of colour-printing in several colours at once. He apparently used this method of colour-printing chiefly or exclusively in 1795-96. Most of his works in Illuminated Printing he later coloured in water-colours, and this of course gave him the opportunity to improve the prints; sometimes he retraced the letters to clarify them, and sometimes he added features in the design, a bird, say, or a tree. Occasionally he added a border or extended the bottom of the design with a stream, particularly with the Songs . At first, in 1790-1800, Blake apparently printed a stock of his own works which he kept on hand for customers. In his Prospectus "To the Public" of 10 October 1793 he announced: No Subscriptions for the numerous great works now in hand are asked for, for none are wanted; but the Author will produce [ i.e. , print ?] his works, and offer them to sale at a fair price. During these years he "had a whole House to range in", as he told Cumberland on 12 April 1827, but later he was cramped for space in a few rooms, and he had little room for his press, for hanging up prints to dry, or for storing them. Consequently he seems later to have printed chiefly to order, and he printed comparatively few copies. On 9 June 1818, he told the collector Dawson Turner that his works were unprofitable enough to me tho Expensive to the Buyer. . . . The few I have Printed &amp; Sold are sufficient to have gained me great reputation as an Artist which was the chief thing Intended But I have never been able to produce a Sufficient number for a general Sale by means of a regular Publisher[.] It is therefore necessary to me that any Person wishing to have any or all of them should send me their Order to Print them . . . &amp; I will take care that they shall be done at least as well as any I have yet Produced[.] The watermarks in his works in Illuminated Printing suggest that they were chiefly produced about 1790-1800, 1805, 1815, 1818-20, 1825-27. However, many copies of his works were apparently not printed by Blake himself. His wife Catherine did all the [ domestic ] Work herself, kept the House clean, &amp; herself tidy, besides printing all Blake's numerous Engravings, which was a Task alone sufficient for any industrious Woman . . . . 18 [ Blake ] allowed her, till the last moment of his practice, to take off his proof impressions and print his works, which she did most carefully, and ever delighted in the task . . . . 19 Blake's methods of printing seem to have been meticulous but not unconventional. He told Cumberland his methods, probably about the time he was helping with the etchings for Cumberland's Thoughts on Outline (1796) and writing to him with directions for "laying on the Wax" on the copperplate (6 December 1795). Cumberland recorded in his Commonplace Book Blakes Instructions to Print Copper Plates Warm the Plate a little and then fill it with Ink by dabbing it all over two or three times.— T hen wipe off the superfluous In k , till the surface is clean—then with the palm of the hand beneath the little finger rubbed over with a little of the Ink &amp; smoothed with whiting by rubbing it on a Ball of it. Wipe the surface of the Plate till it shines all over—then roll it through the Press with 3 blankets above the Plate, and pastboards beneath it next the Plank—Paper may be used instead of Pastboard. 20 There are a number of clear indications that Blake and his wife not only pulled proofs of his works on their own press and printed the small numbers of his works in Illuminated Printings, 21 but that they did a certain amount of commercial printing as well. Hayley's broadside ballad of Little Tom the Sailor (October 1800) was apparently printed entirely by Catherine Blake. On 26 November 1800 Blake wrote to Hayley: "my wife . . . has not printed any more since you went to London. But we can muster a few in colours 22 and some in black which I hope will be no less favourd tho they are rough like rough sailors. We mean to begin printing again tomorrow." Only a few copies of Little Tom have survived, and perhaps no more than a few score were printed. Since the work was printed for charitable purposes, it is possible that for their printing work (and Blake's designing and etching work), the Blakes acquired credit only in heaven, not in the bank. A more extensive labour was for Hayley's Designs to A Series of Ballads issued in parts in June, July, August, and September 1802 with three plates each designed and engraved by Blake, plus two others in the prefatory matter issued with the first part. William Hayley explained in a letter to Lady Hesketh of 10 June 1802 the progress of the first part: He [ Blake ] &amp; his excellent wife (a true Helpmate) pass the plates thro' a rolling press in their own cottage together, &amp; of course it is a work of some Time to collect a Number of Impressions.—But if you find, that you are likely to have many Customers in your new Trade of Ballad Monger , He will take care that you shall not want a stock in Hand . . . ( Blake Records , 97). The work was printed for Blake's benefit and sold chiefly through a network of middle-class and aristocratic ballad-mongers like Lady Hesketh; perhaps not surprisingly, it was a commercial failure. Probably no more than a hundred copies of the first part were sold, and there were evidently progressively smaller sales for the succeeding parts until the work dwindled away entirely, with only four out of the projected fifteen parts in print. Not only the proceeds but the expenses of the work were Blake's, and, taking into account his fair wages as designer, engraver, and printer, it is likely that he lost money on the 1802 Ballads . 23 The most profitable printing undertaking of the Blakes, so far as we know, was that of the plates of Hayley's Life . . . of William Cowper , Volumes I and II (1803). Blake told his brother James on 30 January 1803: "My Wife has undertaken to Print the whole number of the Plates for Cowpers work which she has done to admiration &amp; being under my own eye the prints are as fine as the French prints &amp; please every one." And he confirmed this statement many years later to his young friend John Linnell: "The copper plates which Blake engraved to illustrate Hayley's life of Cowper were as he told me printed entirely by himself and his wife in his own press—a very good one which cost him forty pounds" ( Blake Records , 461 n. 1). There were four plates for the first two volumes, and the printing-run was probably large, 24 perhaps 1,750 copies. This comes to 7,000 prints, an enormous number, and it is no wonder that Hayley wrote to the publisher R. H. Evans on 3 April 1803 that the "plates for the Life of Cowper . . . have engrossed much of his [ Blake's ] time even to this Hour, as He and his good industrious Wife together take all the Impressions from the various Engravings in their own domestic Press . . ." ( Blake Records , 114). The standard are for commerical printing seems to have been about 6 s. per hundred pulls: 25 at this rate, the Blakes might have expected something like £21 for printing 1,750 copies each of the four Cowper plates. On 30 January 1803, when the printing of the plates for the first two volumes may have just begun, Blake told his brother James, "The Publishers are already indebted to My Wife Twenty Guineas for work delivered[ ; ] this is a small specimen of how we go on." This statement may imply that there were yet more copies of the Cowper plates to be printed. Blake's own relations with his patron Hayley were, however, deteriorating at this time, he and his wife were intermittently ill, and the London publisher, Joseph Johnson, must have found considerable difficulty in coordinating his London operations with a Chichester text-printer and his Felpham plate-printers. At any rate, the Blakes do not seem to have been employed to print the plates for Volume III of Cowper (1804), though Blake continued to pull his own proofs. He apologised to Hayley on 21 March 1804 for the delay in sending proof of the Cowper, because "I had not enough paper in proper order for printing; beg pardon . . .". The published version was clearly printed by a commercial copperplate printer, for on 1 April 1804 Hayley wrote: "Blake told me He had found an excellent Copperplate Printer not far from him . . . [ to whom ] He had confided his Work [ of printing the Cowper plates .]" 26 We have information as to who printed Blake's commercial engravings only when they were for books sponsored by his friends such as William Hayley, John Flaxman, and John Linnell. Probably he normally printed his own working-proofs of his commercial engravings, as he almost certainly did those for Flaxman's Hesiod . The earliest proofs, such as those in The British Museum Print Room, were, as he told Maria Denman on 18 March 1827, "Printed on both sides of the Paper . . . many of the backs of the paper have on them impressions from other Plates for Booksellers which he was employd about at the same time" such as Rees's Cyclopaedia . The finished proofs which he took to the publisher in 1814-17 are in Bodley. Perhaps the proofs to be shown to the publisher who commissioned the work were ordinarily printed by a commercial printer; certainly the firm of Cox &amp; Barnett printed the final proofs for Hesoid at 6 d. each in June 1816 and January-February 1817 ( Blake Records , 579-580) as they did the finished plates. We know that Blake pulled his own proofs for his wonderful woodcuts for Thornton's school-text Virgil (1821), for his young disciple Samuel Palmer wrote on one set of Virgil proofs: "M r Blake gave This page to me in Fountain Court [ where Blake lived 1821-27 ]: impressions taken there, at his own press, by his own hands, and signed by him [W Blake fecit] under my eyes . . .". 27 The early working-proofs for Job were probably pulled by Blake at his own press, but later proofs were ordered by John Linnell (who had commissioned the set) first at Dixon's on 3-4 March 1825 and immediately thereafter at J. Lahee's on 5 March and in September, October 1825 and February 1826, and Lahee apparently printed the 315 sets of the first edition in March 1826 for £49.19.11; Linnell tipped the pressman Freeman £1 ( Blake Records , 300, 321, 582, 590, 602-603). In his last years, Blake probably printed little besides proofs of the plates he was then working on such as Job and Dante. On 19 February 1826 he told his new friend Crabb Robinson, evidently in a rather captious spirit: I shall print no more—he said[.]—When I am commanded by the Spirits then I write, And the moment I have written, I see the Words fly about the room in all directions[.] It is then published[.]—The Spirits can read and my MS: is of no further use[.]—I have been tempted to burn my MS, but my wife wont let me.—( Blake Records , 547). In earlier years, he had clearly printed a stock of his own works in Illuminated Printing, but in his two cramped rooms in Fountain Court he could not afford to be so forehanded. Four months before his death, he wrote on 12 April 1827 to his old friend George Cumberland: You are desirous I know to dispose of some of my Works &amp; to make them Pleasin[ g .] I am obliged to you &amp; to all who do so But having none remaining of all that I had Printed I cannot Print more Except at a great loss for at the time I printed those things I had a whole House to range in [ 1790-1800 at Hercules Buildings, Lambeth; ?1800-1803 at Felpham; ] now I am shut up in a Corner therefore am forced to ask a Price for them that I scarce expect to get from a Stranger. I am now Printing a Set of the Songs of Innocence &amp; Experience for a Friend [? T. G. Wainewright ] at Ten Guineas which I cannot do under Six Months consistent with my other Work, so that I have little hope of doing any more of such things. At Blake's death in August 1827, his wife Catherine inherited all his small property, including his printing press and his hundreds of copperplates. These she moved to John Linnell's house in Cirencester Place, where she was to be housekeeper, but, as Cumberland reported to his son in January 1828, "her late husbands works she intends to print[ t ] with her own hands and trust to their sal[ e ] for a livelihood—" ( Blake Records , 365.) It would not be surprising if she had printed some of Blake's works after his death, but no surviving copy can be so identified. At her death in October 1831, all her property passed to Blake's disciple Frederick Tatham, with whom Catherine had lived for a time. We know that Tatham printed copies, for they are on paper watermarked 1831 and 1832. The quality of the printing is distinctly inferior to the Blakes'; he seems to have used only shades of brown and black, and he regularly omitted to wipe the ink from the borders of the plates as the Blakes had done. And not only did he somewhat debase the works in printing them, but he managed to lose all the hundreds of plates of Blake which had come to him (he said they were stolen from him) ( Blake Records , 417 n. 3). William Blake was thus an enterprising and energetic innovator in engraving and in copper-plate printing. Here as elsewhere, however, his interest was in eternal beauty rather than in temporal profit: "My business is not to gather gold, but to make glorious shapes expressing god-like sentiments". 28 He has gained from posterity what his contemporaries denied him. He deserves to be remembered for his technical inventiveness and expertise as well as for his grander creations in design, engraving, and poetry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * I am grateful to my friend Professor Robert Essick for invaluable advice about several technical features of Blake's printing. The essay on "The Printing of Blake's Illuminated Works", pp. xlvii-lii in William Blake's Writings (1979), Vol. I, is much narrower in scope and extent than the present essay. 1 Blake's Notebook p. 55; cf. p. 47. ( William Blake's Writings [1979] is the source of all the Blake quotations here.) 2 Descriptive Catalogue (1809), last paragraph. 3 Very detailed instructions about how " To engrave [ on copper ] with aquafortis, so that the work may appear like a basso relievo" are given in the first chapter of Anon., Valuable Secrets concerning Arts and Trades [1758], 1775, 1778, 1795, 1798, 1809, 1810. The book does not deal with printing from such plates. 4 "Hints on various Modes of Printing from Autographs", Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts , 28 (Jan 1811), 56-59. 5 Blake Records (1969) 460 n. 1. 6 Probable exceptions are his plates for George Cumberland's Thoughts on Outline (1796), Edward Young, Night Thoughts (1797), William Hayley, An Essay on Sculpture (1800), Hayley, Little Tom the Sailor (1800), Hayley, Designs to A Series of Ballads (1802), Hayley, Life . . . of William Cowper (1803, 1804), Chaucer, Prologue (1812), Job (1826), and Dante (?1827). We must, therefore, be cautious about assuming that Blake lettered his commercial plates for books—see D. V. Erdman, "Dating Blake's Script: The 'g' hypothesis" and G. E. Bentley, Jr., "Blake Sinister 'g', from 1789-93 to ?1803", Blake Newsletter , III (1969), 8-13, 42-45. 7 It has been generally assumed that the "visionary imagination" occurred after Robert Blake's death in 1787, but this is not a necessary conclusion from Smith's language, and an earlier date, such as 1784, is at least possible. 8 Linnell wrote that this liquid "was nothing more I believe than the usual stopping as it is called used by engravers made chiefly of pitch and diluted with Terps" ( Blake Records [1969], 460 n. 1). 9 Blake Records (1969), 472-473, quoted by Cunningham in his influential biography of 1830 (p. 504). 10 Virgin Wax is purified wax. (Cumberland called it "common white-wax"—see note 4 above.) The need for a perfect surface on the wax is indicated by Blake's directions "To Engrave on Pewter" quoted below. 11 British Museum Add. MSS 36, 497, f. 348 v , quoted in a footnote to p. 4 of Blake's Notebook , ed. D. V. Erdman (1973). The rest of the quotation is irrelevant to Blake. I am grateful to D. V. Erdman, Allan Pritchard, and J. R. de J. Jackson for information about this memorandum. 12 Quoted from a photograph (generously sent me by its owner, Mr. Edward Croft-Murray) of the inscription in Cumberland's hand. 13 Perhaps Pierre Ducros (1745-1810), painter and engraver. 14 Blake Records (1969), 214, where it is misdated 1809. The date-stamp is obscure. 15 According to Miss Marion Linton of the National Library of Scotland. 16 Lizar's account did not appear in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal for June—October 1819, as Sir Geoffrey Keynes ( Blake Studies [1971], 246) says it did. According to David Bindman, "There is no contemporary account of Blake's method of printing" ( The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake , ed. D. Bindman [1978], 15), but, as may be seen below, this is not quite so. 17 In his letter of 13 Dec 1803 Blake apologises for not having sent Hayley a proof yet, "my Press not yet being put up". His apology to Cumberland in his letter of 4 Dec 1795 for not sending a proof, "my paper not being in order", seems to imply that he intended to pull the proof himself. 18 Frederick Tatham's MS "Life of Blake" (?1832) in Blake Records (1969), 522. 19 J. T. Smith, Nollekens and his Times (1828) in Blake Records (1969), 459. 20 George Cumberland, MS Commonplace Book, f. 75 r (GEB Collection). 21 Songs of Innocence and of Experience is the Blake work which survives in the largest number of copies; we can trace today some 25 copies printed by the Blakes between about 1794 and 1827, about one per year. Some of his works survive in only one copy (e.g., The Book of Los ), and at least one work, his Prospectus "To the Public" (1793), does not survive in a contemporary copy at all. 22 No copy in colour, i.e., printed in brown, say, or blue, rather than black, is known to have survived. The ballad was intended to be sold to village folk for the benefit of the family of the brave sailor boy it celebrates, and the roughness of its printing was therefore not inappropriate to its audience. The printing was tricky, however, for there were four plates to be printed on one broadside leaf. There is no evidence that it was sold to London connoisseurs. 23 Blake Records (1969), 116-117. When the Designs to A Series of Ballads (1802) was reissued commercially in a new format in 1805, Blake was evidently involved not at all in the printing and only partially in the profits. 24 It was believed that Hayley had made £11,000 from editions of his Life . . . of William Cowper in 1803-4, 1806, 1809, 1812 (Alexander Stephens, Memoirs of John Horne Tooke [1813], II, 489 fn), and even allowing for gross exaggeration in the sum, and much larger printing-runs for later editions, it is fair to assume that the first printing was a large one. 25 G. E. Bentley, Jr. The Early Engravings of Flaxman's Classical Designs (1964). 26 Blake Records (1969), 151; Blake's letter to Hayley with this information is not known. In his 31 March 1804 letter Blake merely says "we directly go to Printing. . . . Johnson [ the Publisher ] . . . wants them [ the Plates ] to set the Printer to work upon". 27 Quoted from a reproduction of the MS in the possession of Mr Philip Hofer. 28 Allan Cunningham, quoted in Blake Records , 480.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Signatures and Dashes in Novels Printed by T. C. Newby in the Eighteen-Forties by G. D. Hargreaves *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thomas Cautley Newby is best known as the publisher of the first edition of Wuthering Heights (London, 1847), but Emily Brontë's masterpiece was just one of about 130 novels published by Newby in the eighteen-forties. 1 Their usual format is a royal duodecimo, 2 and they are mostly in the standard three volumes, comprising an output rivalled, even in this great decade of London fiction publishing, only by Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley. 3 Many of the volumes, moreover, like volume II of Wuthering Heights itself, 4 have the imprint of Newby not only as publisher but as printer. These duodecimo volumes with the printer's imprint of Newby tend to show recurrent production features of considerable peculiarity. The most striking of these is the employment of a signature with the figure 3 (e.g. 'B3') on the second of the twelve leaves in the gathering. It is usually accompanied in the gathering by two normal signatures, one on the first leaf ('B'), the other on the fifth ('B5'). The aberrational usage on the second leaf has been recorded in descriptions of Wuthering Heights , 5 but no explanation of the error appears to have been advanced, and it in fact occurs in over 50% of fiction volumes with the printer's imprint of Newby in the period 1846-1848, and in nearly 80% of such volumes in 1842-1843. Several standard systems for signing duodecimos can be found in the nineteenth-century printers' manuals. Savage, whose generally up-to-date manual of 1841 occasionally reflects eighteenth-century practice, repeats the Moxon-Smith-Luckombe system of placing a signature on every leaf in the first half of the gathering ('A'-'A6'). 6 As early as 1808, on the other hand, Stower's scheme for 'twelves' with cutting calls for signatures on the first, second, and fifth leaves only ('A A2 A5' in Stower's diagram, 'B B2 B3' in his text); 7 the rationale here is that the isolated 'A5' or 'B3' especially signals the first leaf of the offcut. Johnson's manual of 1824 shows the same rationale, but here the first leaf of the offcut is signed with the figure 3 in both diagram ('a3') and text ('B3'). 8 This use of the figure 3 on the fifth leaf of the gathering has itself seemed aberrational to twentieth-century bibliographers, who naturally equate a signature 'B3' with the leaf B3, 9 but nineteenth-century printers doubtless contented themselves with the logic of signing with the figure 3 the third leaf bearing a signature. Another system, which I have found only in American authorities (e.g. MacKellar), uses only two signatures—one on the first leaf of the gathering and the second (with figure 2) on the first leaf of the offcut ('B B2'). 10 In actual practice, some early nineteenth-century British duodecimo novels, as we might expect, follow the 'B'-'B6' system of the eighteenth century, but all four systems described above appear in British novels during the first quarter of the nineteenth century; although 'B'-'B6' can still be found in the eighteen-forties and 'B B2' also appears then, the second quarter of the century tends to be dominated by 'B B2 B5' and 'B B2 B3', with the latter seeming to gain ground in the eighteen-forties and perhaps becoming the prevailing system after 1850. 11 A novel printed in more than one shop was liable to show more than one system, according to shop usage, as can be seen from the first edition in book form of Oliver Twist (3 vols. 1838), volume III of which has the 'B B2 B5' system in the portions printed by Samuel Bentley, but 'B B2 B3' in the portions printed in Charles Whiting's shop. 12 The 'B B3 B5' aberration practised in T. C. Newby's shop looks like a conflation or confusion of these normal 'B B2 B5' and 'B B2 B3' alternatives, and a direct source of the confusion is actually to be found in the manuals of Hansard (1825) and Timperley (1838). The fact that Stower (1808), as we have seen, has 'B B2 B3' in his text and 'A A2 A5' in his diagram possibly did not help his successors, but at least these were cogent alternatives. Hansard, on the other hand, has 'B B2 B5' in his text, but his diagram shows 'A A3 A5'. 13 Timperley, for his part, has 'B B2 B3' in his text, but gives exactly the same diagram as Hansard, even though it illustrates an alternative system and does so with an error. 14 When the textbooks were capable of such things, and when at least two cogent systems were in regular current use, it is hardly surprising that some practitioners were led astray. That personnel setting novels in Newby's composing room were often ill-equipped to combat such misleading and confusing circumstances is suggested by several further peculiarities evident in the signatures which they set. The most consistent of these peculiarities is the placement of signatures decidedly to the left of centre in the signature line. This seems to be especially the case with the signatures on the second and fifth leaves, the one on the first leaf often being more centrally placed (probably to avoid close proximity to the volume number). Instruction on signature placement is rather scarce in the printers' manuals, but such as can be found more or less favours the right. Moxon (p. 210) prescribes "about the middle of the Line , or rather a small matter nearer the end than the middle is, (because when the Sheets are wrought off and gather'd, they Collation something quicker . . .", while Johnson (II, 134) states: "In our opinion the signature is much better both in appearance, and for collating, when placed within about four m's from the end of the line, than in the centre, according to the old custom." Timperley (p. 17) goes even further and specifies "the right hand corner of the page." In actual British practice in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, signatures do seem to be placed most frequently more or less to the right of centre, with occasional central placement, and any tendency more or less to the left, as seen in these volumes printed by Newby, would seem to be very unusual at this and indeed most other periods. 15 Apart from this peculiarity of signature placement, random mis-signings (in addition to the basic 'B3' for 'B2' error) occur in Newby printing, while his signatures are frequently omitted and occasionally even inverted ('B3'), reversed ('3B'), or placed on a verso. 16 Another production feature characteristic of novels printed by Newby, especially in the period 1845-1847, is the intermittent use of three hyphens ('---') or three full points ('. . .') as a substitute for the em dash ('—'). The reason for this is not altogether clear. Some novels printed by Newby seem to be particularly rich in the use of the dash (or its Newby-style substitutes), and it is possible that a shortage of em dashes proper may have arisen from a tendency on the part of Newby's compositors to set dashes strictly according to copy when other shops would have substituted more formal punctuation. Unfortunately, there appears to be no surviving printer's copy for any Newby novel, but comparison between the printer's copy and the first edition of Jane Eyre (printed by Stewart and Murray, for Smith, Elder, 3 vols. 1847) shows the considerable extent to which an author's dashes could be suppressed by the printer in favour of more formal punctuation. 17 Not surprisingly, Newby's own press was unable to cope with all his publishing commitments, and the imprints of other printers appear in some of the novels which he published. But many of the fiction volumes with his publisher's imprint have no printer's imprint at all, 18 and the combined appearance in some of these of the peculiar features described above would seem to constitute a useful body of evidence that he was also their printer. 19 Thus while only the second of the two volumes of Wuthering Heights (1847) carries the name of Newby as printer, it seems almost certain that volume I, with the 'B B3 B5' signing system, an inverted signature, many signatures placed on the left, and the occasional use of '. . .' for '—', is also a product of Newby's printing shop. 20 A similar case is Charles Lister's The College Chums (2 vols. 1845), in which only volume II has a printer's imprint (Newby's) but both volumes use 'B B3 B5', with many signatures on the left and occasional '---' for '—'. Sybil Lennard (3 vols. 1846), attributed to Mrs. Grey, 21 has no printer's imprint in volume II (volumes I and III have Newby's), but all volumes use 'B B3 B5', with signatures generally on the left, while volume I has occasional '---', and both '---' and '. . .' appear frequently in volumes II and III. Conversely, it seems certain that Newby was not himself involved in the printing of Anne Brontë's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (3 vols. 1848), which throughout uses 'B B2 B3', with all signatures on the right and all the many dashes normal, 22 and although volumes I and II are without a printer's imprint, there is no reason to suppose that they were not printed in the same shop as Volume III, which has the printer's imprint of J. Billing, Woking. It may be thought unnecessary in these cases to suppose that there might be any question of an imprint in just one or two volumes not speaking in itself for an entire set, but two further novels published by Newby readily illustrate the potential problem. Although the final volume of Anthony Trollope's first novel, The Macdermots of Ballycloran (3 vols. 1847), has the printer's imprint of Newby and 'B B3 B5', with signatures central (first leaf) or on the left (second and fifth leaves) and a bout of '---' and '. . .' for '—' (pp. 128-131), it seems unlikely that Newby printed volumes I and II, which have no printer's imprint but use the 'B B2' system, with signatures central or on the right and normal dashes. Again, while the third volume of Eliza Lynn Linton's Azeth the Egyptian (3 vols. 1847) has the printer's imprint of W. N. Judd and 'B B2 B3', with signatures all well to the right and normal dashes, 23 volumes I and II, which are without a printer's imprint but have 'B B3 B5', with signatures mostly on the left, several unsigned offcuts, and frequent '. . .' or '---' for '—', were surely printed not by Judd but by Newby himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * Most of the novels in question have been examined in the Bodleian and/or the National Library of Scotland, and I should like to thank the reader-services staff in these libraries. Reader-services staff at St. Andrews University Library have also been very helpful. The greatest acknowledgement is due to my wife, without whose extensive research assistance this note could not have been compiled. 1 Figure based on a survey of Andrew Block, The English Novel 1740-1850: A Catalogue , new and rev. ed. (1961). Newby appears to have commenced publishing in 1842 in association with T. &amp; W. Boone and to have become established in his own right in 1843. His output was by no means confined to fiction. (See further The Publishers' Circular and The English Catalogue of Books .) 2 Leaf size approx. 7 x 4¾ ins. in uncut copies. Gatherings are of twelve leaves, and unopened copies show that duodecimo with cutting was employed, the four central leaves of the gathering comprising the offcut. Contemporary trade sources (such as The Publishers' Circular and The English Catalogue ) tend to describe these novels as "post 8vo."—true post octavos are in fact rather similar in leaf size to royal duodecimos but are of course differently produced. 3 Figures emerge from Block of about 130 for Colburn and about 110 for Bentley. Other noted publishers of fiction are well down on these figures for the period (Longman 55, Chapman &amp; Hall 40, Saunders &amp; Otley 35, Smith, Elder 25). 4 Wuthering Heights appeared as volumes I and II of a hybrid three-decker with Anne Brontë's Agnes Grey as volume III, which also has the printer's imprint of Newby. Volume I has no printer's imprint—see below. 5 T. J.

For twelves without cutting Stower gives signatures on the first, second, and third leaves ('B B2 B3')—p. 175(diagram). 8 John Johnson, Typographia (1824; facsimile impression, Gregg Press, 1966), II, 135, 158(diagram *14). 9 Wise, A Bibliography . . . of the Brontë Family , p. 109, notes under the first edition of Anne Brontë's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (3 vols. 1848): "In each volume the signature to the fifth leaf of each sheet is usually misnumbered 3" (see further on The Tenant below). R. B. McKerrow called it "a curious and very misleading method," in An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927), p. 79. Mrs. C. G. F. Gore's The Man of Fortune (3 vols. [1842], printed by Charles Reynell for Colburn) has not merely the third signature (e.g. 'B3') on the fifth leaf but the second signature (e.g. 'B2') consistently on the third leaf. 10 Thomas MacKellar, The American Printer , 13th ed. (1882), p. 165(diagram); American Dictionary of Printing and Bookmaking (1894; facsimile impression, Detroit, Gale, 1967), pp. 279(diagram), 509—this actually refers to half-sheet imposition for gathering in sixes, but the principle is the same. 11 Based chiefly on a survey of the substantial holdings of nineteenth-century novels in St. Andrews University Library. 'B'-'B6' occurs in Theodore Hook's Fathers and Sons (3 vols. 1842, printed by Gilbert &amp; Rivington for Colburn)—this also appears to have residual press-figures, the latest I have seen and another relatively out-of-date feature of Savage's 1841 manual (p. 814); see also note 19 below. 'B B2' was used by James Ballantyne in Edinburgh for e.g. Scott's Waverley (3 vols. 1814), Guy Mannering (3 vols. 1815) and The Antiquary (3 vols. 1816), as was noticed by R. W. Chapman in The Library , 4th ser., 4 (1924), 180 note; in the eighteen-forties it occurs in Trollope's The Macdermots of Ballycloran (see below). 12 See Kathleen Tillotson, in the Clarendon Dickens edition of Oliver Twist , ed. Kathleen Tillotson (1966), p. xlix. 13 T. C. Hansard, Typographia (1825; facsimile impression, Gregg Press, 1966), pp. 498, 508(diagram). 14 C. H. Timperley, The Printers' Manual (1838; facsimile impression, Gregg Press, 1965), pp. 18, 26(diagram). 15 A rightward tendency appears to be usual up to c. 1700; from c. 1725-c. 1825 a preference for central placement is evident, with a return to a rightward tendency c. 1825-c. 1900. In modern British practice, however, signatures (if used at all) tend to be placed on the extreme left. 16 Errors of this kind may not, of course, persist through an entire edition, though five copies of C. F. Henningsen's Sixty Years Hence (3 vols. 1847), including what appear to be two copies of a second issue—calling itself "second edition"—1847 and one of a third issue 1848, do show some such anomalies in common (my thanks for information to Ms. Jessica S. Owaroff of the Houghton Library, Harvard University; Mr. Thomas D. Burney of the Library of Congress; and Mr. Douglas Matthews of the London Library); but see note 20 below. Some hints can be found of the distraction these errors must have caused in warehouse and bindery: the National Library of Scotland copy of volume I of Sixty Years Hence (second issue, original cloth) has no fewer than ten of the offcuts inserted in the wrong gatherings. 17 See the textual footnotes in the Clarendon Edition of Jane Eyre , ed. Jane Jack and Margaret Smith (1969), esp. p. 408. 18 The strict legal sanctions against this introduced in an Act of 1799 had been considerably reduced by Acts of 1811 and 1839—see W. B. Todd, "London Printers' Imprints, 1800-1840," The Library , 5th ser., 21 (1966), 46-59. 19 The combination factor must be stressed: a few examples of '---' for '—' occur in volume III of Lady Charlotte Bury's Family Records (3 vols. 1841, printed by B. Bensley for Saunders and Otley), though the signatures are on the right and normal (except that volume I has 'B'-'B6' but volumes II and III use 'B B2 B5', in spite of the fact that all have the same printer's imprint); again, the anonymous Roland Percie (2 vols. 1846), a novel published by Newby but with the printer's imprint of G. Paul, Bury St. Edmunds, in both volumes, has the 'B B3 B5' system with some signatures placed on the left, though the dashes are normal throughout. 20 Albert Smith, in the Clarendon Edition of Wuthering Heights , p. xxxiv, indicates that the inverted signature ('B3' on B2) does not occur in all copies. It may be significant that '. . .' for '—' proliferates in a section of volume I where one might particularly expect the copy to have employed heavy use of the dash—the delirious assertions of Catherine in chapter 12 (some modern editions—e.g. Clarendon, World's Classics, Penguin English Library—commendably, but I believe wrongly, retain '. . .' here). 21 Full name in catalogues given as either Catherine Maria Grey or Elizabeth Caroline Grey. 22 Like some novels printed by Newby, this first edition of The Tenant may well retain a relatively high proportion of dashes from the lost MS. copy—the printed punctuation, especially in dialogue, is often very informal. 23 This is not to say that volume III of Azeth is generally well printed—like Wuthering Heights its text shows numerous disfigurements attributable to case and press, among the more striking of which are several instances of '!' for 'l' (e.g. 'credu!ity') and the occurrence of 'Thy no sojourn' for 'Thy sojourn on'. In spite of this, it is possible that, in some respects, shops like Newby's and Judd's, by their very lack of sophistication, may have preserved features of lost MS. copy to a greater extent than more competent establishments.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A George Eliot Notebook by Valerie A. Dodd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This document is in the George Eliot Collection of Nuneaton Library, Warwickshire, England (No. GE 890 ELI—8): there is no definite information about its provenance, but it was already in the collection in 1946. The appearance of the notebook is unremarkable: it measures about 6½” by 10½”, and has a leather, or leather-cloth, cover. The paper is of reasonable quality, with no distinctive watermark. It appears to be a fairly commonplace article of stationery. 1 Forty-two leaves of the notebook have been used; the verso of the leaf has often been left blank, as if for further additions. The numbering of the leaves is erratic, and the size of the handwriting and the colour of the ink both vary throughout. The notebook is entitled, "Greek Philosophy &amp; Locke &amp; Comte" and opposite appears the additional title "George Eliot's Notebook." 2 Both titles may have been added as an afterthought, as they are written above the line, in the top margin of the first leaf. There are two pieces of evidence for the possible dating of the notebook. On fol. 13 appears the note "Re-read Dec. 15 1876"; on the first leaf is pasted a letter to the Editor of The Times entitled, "The Moon of Mars" written by Richard A. Proctor. The advertisements on the other side of the cutting are dated September 1877. Many of the entries in the notebook may thus be tentatively assigned to the period 1867-1877. The letter may have been preserved not only because it raised the question of scientific prediction, so central to the Comtean philosophy in which George Eliot was interested, but also because George Eliot, when working on Daniel Deronda in 1872, had made notes on gambling superstitions from an article Proctor had published in The Cornhill Magazine in June of the same year. 3 The 1877 dating suggests a possible explanation of the notebook's contents. George Eliot appears to have been keeping a personal memorandum on the history of philosophy, and may have returned to her notes in 1877 when Frederic Harrison, one of the leaders of the English Positivists, was urging her to write a Positivist liturgy. Harrison wrote to her on June 12th, 1877: "I have often longed that we could have your full estimate of the scheme of the Polity, now that it is complete in its English form. I mean especially your judgment of a Religion of Humanity, as a possible rallying point for mankind in the future. That you differ very much from the form which Comte has given it in such sharp lines, I know, or suppose that I know. But where you differ, wherein, how far; when you agree, how far—this is what we all want to know." George Eliot's readers, according to Harrison, were constantly asking about her views on Positivism, and George Eliot, he suggested, might, "answer them, not by way of poetry, but by philosophy. . . . There are some things that Art cannot do, and one is, to tell us what to believe . . ." (Haight, Eliot , p. 506). Harrison, and other members of the English Positivist movement, had recently completed a translation of Comte's penultimate work, Système de politique positive (1851-54), the first part of which was published in 1875. This translation is referred to on fol. 25 of the notebook. The extracts from Comte are prefaced, on fol. 24, by a list of questions on the nature of virtue, suggesting that Harrison's letter may have prompted George Eliot to reconsider her opinion of Comte's ethics. The Système was the most dogmatic of Comte's works, and was castigated by John Stuart Mill as an attempt to impose upon mankind, "the completest system of spiritual and temporal despotism, which ever yet emanated from a human brain, unless possibly that of Ignatius Loyola." 4 If my hypotheses are correct, the notebook re-emphasises how George Eliot's interest in Comte continued throughout her life, and also affords evidence of her tendency to rescrutinise her own opinions, indicative of a scepticism not merely about the ideas of others, but also about her own views. The 1860s saw her similarly reassessing her attitude towards German criticism of the Bible, spurred on by the publication of Ernest Renan's Vie de Jésus (1863) and David Friedrich Strauss's second life of Christ, which appeared in 1864. 5 The next section of the notebook, from fol. 2 to 10 v contains extracts from Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics and Sir Alexander Grant's The Ethics of Aristotle . 6 Fols. 2 and 3 also refer to Aristotle's Metaphysics and contain a note on the form of the practical syllogism; these points appear to have been added afterwards; the writing is both smaller and lighter in colour. Fols. 5 to 10 v contain an outline of Greek philosophy, with the names of the movements, dates of birth of the main figures, and summaries of, for instance, Zeno's "arguments against motion" on fol. 5, and of Plato's thought on fol. 9. Aristotle, to whom most space is devoted, was, perhaps, one of George Eliot's special interests: in 1852, she was arguing about the Aristotelian view of virtue with Herbert Spencer (Haight, Eliot , pp. 114-115), and Lewes was to write on Aristotle's scientific thought in A Chapter in the History of Science (1864). The reference to Grant's book is interesting, for Grant prefaced his commentary with seven long essays. From the second, "On the History of Moral Philosophy in Greece, previous to Aristotle", George Eliot may have taken her outline of Greek philosophy; she devotes a special page of her notebook to Plato, and Grant's third essay had considered Aristotle's ethics in relation to Plato. Grant had, moreover, in his seventh essay, "On the Relation of Aristotle's Ethics to Modern Systems", discussed Aristotle's philosophy, albeit briefly, in relation to the views of Strauss and Comte (I, 384-387). If, as I have suggested, the notes were made as a response to Harrison's letter, she may, with characteristic thoroughness, have decided to attempt to assess Comte in relation to the rest of European thought. This latter suggestion gains some support from the entry on fol. 11 which opens the second section. This leaf contains a "Catena Philosophorum": a list of modern thinkers, with the dates of their births and deaths, and the ages at which they died. The list on the left hand side contains (in this order): Bacon, Galileo, Gassendi, Descartes, Spinoza, Boyle, Locke, Newton, Leibnitz, Berkeley, Hartley, Hume, Kant, Gall, Hegel, Comte. On the right side are added, in a slightly varying script, the names of Shaftesbury (opposite Locke), Mandeville (opposite Newton), "Butler Sermons, 1726" (opposite Leibnitz) and "Hutcheson died, 1747' (opposite Berkeley). The leaves which follow contain quotations from some of the philosophers listed on fol. 11, plus comments and queries. The leaves may be subdivided thus: 12-13 Locke. 14 Descartes. 15-16 Quetelet, Sur l'homme . 16 Hutcheson. (An entry in a lighter colour ink than that on Quetelet.) 20 v -23 Kant. (Also in a smaller, lighter colour writing). There is also a reference to Fischer, one of the early commentators on Kant. 7 Sub-sections not having reference to specific philosophers also appear: miscellaneous notes on fol. 12 v , 16 v , 23 v and 11 v ; a note on syllogisms on fol. 17; notes on the duration of the earth on fol. 18-20; questions about virtue on fol. 24. The list on fol. 11 gives the date of Comte's death in 1857, which supports the view that this notebook belongs to a later period of George Eliot's life; the space devoted to Comte, and the fact that the list ends with his name, may support my hypothesis that the notebook was written as a response to Harrison's letter. That George Eliot opens the list with Bacon, and closes it with Comte, echoes Lewes's analysis of trends in philosophy in A Biographical History of Philosophy (4 vols., 1845-46). The list also raises other interesting points. George Eliot includes in her "chain" of philosophers (the Latin word suggests a desire to link in superficially disparate figures) Galileo, Newton and Boyle, who were scientists, and Gall, who was a phrenologist: fol. 11 v contains a quotation from Scotus Erigena, under the heading of "Identity of Philosophy &amp; Religion", and George Eliot records the same words which Lewes had used in the opening chapter of Volume III of A Biographical History of Philosophy . Both entries suggest that characteristically polymathic quality of George Eliot's mind, which sought to illuminate one discipline by recourse to another, and which attracted her initially to writers such as Comte who sought to construct comprehensive systems which linked a theory of knowledge to science, religion and ethics. Her selection of nineteenth-century names is also interesting. She includes only four thinkers who survived into her own century: the mention of Gall suggests a continuing interest in phrenology, and the mention of Kant and Hegel recalls the fact that the association of her name with Positivism should not lead to an ignoring of her interest in Idealism. She remains faithful to the original and early exponents of Idealism, to whose works she had been introduced in the late 1830s and early 1840s: in the case of Kant, by her reading of Carlyle and Coleridge; in the case of Hegel, by her work on David Friedrich Strauss's Das Leben Jesu and her friendship with John Sibree, one of the pioneer translators of Hegel into English. A final and general point emerges from the existence of this document. When on June 8th, 1876, George Eliot finished writing Daniel Deronda , she may have turned to her notebook as a respite from the arduous task of imaginative composition. To the Victorian public, she was primarily known as a novelist; in private, she was, if not a philosopher, worthy of the designation of philosophe . But if, as I suggest, she returned to the history of speculation in response to Harrison's letter, another important point needs to be added. She turned to philosophy when she wished to relate it to possible action, to a human reality. Her scepticism about systems and statements of belief, which she shared with so many advanced Victorian thinkers, persists: the notes may have been made in an attempt to reassess her views on Auguste Comte's work, but she never produced a text of a Positivist liturgy.</field>

I would like to thank Mr. Barlow for his help, and also the Library Committee for their permission to use this material. Professor Joseph Wiesenfarth of the University of Wisconsin suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook was one of the items sold in a sale at Sotheby's on June 27, 1923.

Prof. Wiesenfarth relates these extracts to Felix Holt , and dates them in the sixties, and 2) Pforzheimer Library MS. No. 707, which is one of George Eliot's notebooks for Daniel Deronda . I base my later dating of the notebook under consideration upon the letter from The Times . The existence of the other two notebooks strengthens the case for considering her interest in Comte to be consistent over a long period. 5 The George Eliot Letters , ed. Gordon S.

      <field name="fulltext">In 1963, when I was studying R. H. Shepherd's piracies of Tennyson's The Lover's Tale ([1870] and 1875), I found I must also deal with some related pamphlets—two sets of minor poems [n.d.; 16 and 32 pages respectively] and a variant of the second set which bears the title The New Timon and the Poets ("1876"). I wrote to Mr Herbert Cahoon of the Morgan Library, to whom I was already much indebted for information about the sources and condition of the Morgan Tennysons, and asked him, without much hope, whether he could somehow supply me with a scrap of paper from the Morgan copy of The New Timon ? He replied (27 June 1963), "I am happy to comply with your request for a specimen of paper from The New Timon , which I enclose. This was not a problem for these pieces had become detached." He had enclosed the specimen in a plastic envelope, which I did not open. I sent it to London, and on 24 July 1963 Messrs Hehner &amp; Cox, Ltd., despatched to me an analysis, signed by Dr. Julius Grant, certifying that the specimen contained approximately 32% chemical wood and 68% esparto. The presence of chemical wood indicated that The New Timon could not have been printed in 1870; possibly, though not probably, it could have been printed in 1876; a much later date seemed to be indicated. I announced the analysis in an article [ Studies in Bibliography , 18 [1965] 111-145, hereafter referred to as SB]. The unexpected information had changed the tenor of my article, as the reader may notice on pages 138 and 140. I was led to suppose that The New Timon was a forgery produced about 1896-1897 by T. J. Wise. With two minor exceptions, my conclusions were accepted by Messrs Carter and Pollard in their Working Paper No. 1: Precis of Paden [Oxford: distributed for the authors by B. H. Blackwell Ltd., 1967], though their own further investigations, pursued with extreme skill, led them to attribute the production of The New Timon , or at least, its introduction into the rarebook market, not to Wise, but to Harry Buxton Forman. Their conclusion was certainly correct. Later, as part of their preparations for a second edition of their Enquiry , Carter and Pollard submitted to an analyst a scrap of paper taken from the British Museum copy of The New Timon , and were told that the paper contained no chemical wood at all. When Mr Carter wrote me of this (15 January 1973), I was able to show him how I had been misled by sending him xeroxes of Mr Cahoon's covering letter and Hehner &amp; Cox's report. His first notion (31 January 1973) was that "different copies of the same piece were printed on different stocks of paper"; but realistically, the fact that the specimen I submitted for analysis had "become detached" from the Morgan New Timon must be given precedence. No doubt Mr Cahoon had found the scrap in the red morocco case that protects the pamphlet, and had assumed, naturally enough, that it had fallen from the pamphlet. But in sixty years something else, something not mysterious but indefinable, must have happened, and Dr. Julius Grant's analysis cannot be supposed to apply to The New Timon . My article of 1965 being left without a conclusion, I should have pursued the matter further. I have not done so until recently. The appearance of some additional evidence has changed the nature of the task. The most helpful accretion has been the itemized list of relevant pamphlets in Tennyson's personal library, now deposited in the Tennyson Research Centre at Lincoln ( Tennyson in Lincoln , II, 1973, pages 18 &amp; 22). There is also a copy of Shepherd's collection of Tennyson's minor poems which was found by Theodore Hofmann in the private storerooms of Bertram Dobell's shop when Hofmann and Freeman bought the old business, and which was acquired by Quaritch, from whose catalog 926 ( Harry Buxton Forman , item 145) I obtained it (referred to as Q 145). The solution of the matter was not difficult, and may be briefly set down. When in 1870 a copy of The Lover's Tale (printed and suppressed by Tennyson in 1832) was bought at public auction by the publisher Basil Montagu Pickering, his employee Richard Herne Shepherd made for himself a manuscript copy of the text and caused a small edition to be printed. Having learned of the piracy, Pickering demanded that Shepherd turn over to him all the printed copies still in his possession, and also his manuscript copy; and Shepherd complied. Later, in 1875 or 1876, when Tennyson heard of Shepherd's piracies and wrote Pickering a threatening letter, the publisher surrendered to the poet's solicitors 37 printed copies and Shepherd's manuscript copy (Lincoln 4118, 4122). All these are torn horizontally into halves. In 1870, however, Shepherd had retained three proofs of his piracy (Lincoln 4119-4121), one of which he was to send to the printers as copy for his piracy of 1875, as the printer's note upon its half-title still shows (Lincoln 4119); no doubt he surrendered the three proofs to the poet's solicitors in 1876. But in 1870 Shepherd also printed a collection of minor poems that Tennyson had published only in periodicals and newspapers. Pickering had no claim upon this collection, and could not well demand its suppression. For brevity one may note that it consisted of two octavo gatherings, paged [1], 2-32, and contained 18 poems (SB 133-136). Shepherd surrendered one copy in 1876 (Lincoln 4215), bound with a copy of his piracy of Tennyson's The Window ("1867"=1869). Neither component of the little volume had ever been advertised or, so far as we know, sold by Shepherd; he probably had the two piracies bound up together in 1870, and surrendered the volume in 1876 rather because it contained The Window than because it contained the minor poems—but that is another story. Another example (Q 145) bears an owner's notation on the half-title: "n/ -rhs Novem r . 1874"—i.e., bought of Shepherd in November 1874. The half-title also bears the note, in Shepherd's hand, "Under revision | To follow Lover's Tale 3"—i.e., to follow the third gathering (page [48]) in Shepherd's 1875 piracy of the Tale . A third example was sold at Bang's auction room in New York on 9 May 1898 and after some half-dozen other appearances at auctions came to rest in the Huntington Library. A further example was described by Luther S. Livingston ( Bibliography of Lord Tennyson , 1901, p. 66) as part of the set of Tennysons brought together by Dodd, Mead &amp; Co.; in 1904 it (or rather they, for two examples became involved) entered the Morgan Library as part of the set. Livingston admitted he had profited from advance sheets of T. J. Wise's Bibliography of Tennyson (1908; no doubt, sheets representing the later II, 10 &amp; 15). The accounts in Wise are erroneous, to say the least, those in Livingston are egregiously confused, but the two pamphlets (one unopened) may be inspected today in the Morgan Library. And finally, one must add all the copies of The New Timon . For all the pamphlets enumerated above were printed from the same rather careless setting of slightly battered type. The occasional cracked types appear in the same places in all the pamphlets: for example, page 6, line 14, spiced (crack across the column of i ); page 9, line 8, inland (crack across the left leg of the second n ); page 15, line 7, yours (diagonal blur to upper right within u ); page 15, line 13, faded (crack across the shoulder of the first d ); page 19, line 17, heart (two cracks in the shoulder of h ). Three overprintings—also specified in SB 136, note 48—sometimes appear, sometimes do not, and sometimes are replaced by under printings. Shepherd's two piracies of 1870— The Lover's Tale and Poems —are set in two different founts of type, as one should perhaps expect after considering Shepherd's only known statement on the matter ( Bibliography of Tennyson , 1896, p. 50): " The Lover's Tale was originally printed (1870) by Strangeways and Walden, and again (1875) with the Minor Poems, by Ogden." In plain words, Strangeways and Walden did not print the Poems , as the rather careless presswork of the pamphlet might in itself suggest. We do not know who printed it. Graham Pollard wrote ( Precis , p. 9) that The New Timon —and therefore, we may say, the Poems [1870]—was set in Miller and Richard's Long Primer No. 17, 'Old Style'. The Lover's Tale [1870] is set in a Long Primer, 'Modern Style,' which need not here be specified further. The only detail calling for further exploration is the date, 1876, on the titlepage of The New Timon ; as the previous discussion shows, it cannot be correct. It may best be approached by reconsidering the history of Poems [1870] from a slightly different angle, through 1972. In 1870, then, Pickering's caution caused the suppression of Shepherd's piracy of The Lover's Tale and left Shepherd holding something like 50 printed copies of Poems [1870]. He may have given half of the pamphlets away to friends and relatives; he sold none, so far as we know. In November 1874 he sold or gave away one, rather inferior, copy that he had used while checking the earlier appearances of the 18 poems in periodicals and in Tennyson's volumes of verse. In 1876 he surrendered to the poet's solicitors one copy of Poems [1870], which he had had bound with a copy of his piracy of The Window (=Q 145). Then for twenty years we hear no more. In 1892 Shepherd's brother, James Francis Hollings Shepherd, set up as a bookseller under the name of Frank Hollings. Shepherd himself soon fell ill, retreated to his brother's suburban home, and died on 15 July 1895. In 1896 Hollings published Shepherd's posthumous Bibliography of Tennyson , which was bound to attract the attention of Wise and Forman, then busily engaged in forging Tennysonian items. Forman, in particular, cultivated the bookseller, for in 1897 Hollings published Forman's William Morris and his Books . It is difficult to avoid the notion that in these years a number of items moved from Shepherd's pitiful little archive to Forman's bookshelves—including the remaining stock of Poems [1870]. Evidence now comes rapidly. On 9 May 1898 a copy of Poems was sold at Bangs' in New York (see Precis , 23), and later came to rest in the Huntington Library. On 25 September 1899 Forman wrote his initials and the date in his bound copy of The New Timon . Two copies of the Poems and one copy of The New Timon were components of the set of Tennysons brought together by Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., and as such were described by Livingston in his Bibliography of Lord Tennyson (1901). By that time, one may suppose, a copy of The New Timon was in the Ashley Library, though the earliest available date for its presence there seems to stem from Wise's Bibliography of Tennyson (1908). A second hiatus stretches from 1901 to 1920, when Maurice Buxton Forman sold to Quaritch the remainder of The New Timon from his late father's shelves ( Precis , 10-21, 24). (In addition to the copies in the census compiled by Carter and Pollard, two additional copies of The New Timon were in the possession of the Forman family: these were sold at Sotheby's—"stitched, uncut, slightly spotted"—on 10 April 1972 among the books of Mrs Madeleine Buxton Holmes, daughter of Maurice Buxton Forman.) What circumstances can account for this triple wave of dates? In the 1870s the Poems are related to Shepherd; no copy of The New Timon appears until after his death in 1895. One cannot suppose that the Poems , now known in five copies, were proofs of The New Timon , for Shepherd had one of the copies bound, probably in 1870 (Lincoln 4215). In 1898-1899 three copies of the Poems were despatched to the American market, the convenient limbo for the trivial or the slightly 'wrong' rarities in the book-trade, and at this time The New Timon appears in the Dodd, Mead set and on Forman's library shelf. Then twenty years elapse, and Forman dies, before his stock of The New Timon is released to commerce. A simple solution may be suggested. A glance at the titlepage of Poems (reproduced here) will show that it bears only the one word; a second glance at the titlepage of The New Timon (also reproduced) shows that the same word appears there in the same place, but below and above other letterpress. The additional words, and the date, can have been added by a second printing, superimposed upon the original titlepage. But who can have done this, and when? Did Shepherd do it in 1876? That seems unlikely, for in January 1876 Shepherd held 50 copies of his revised set of Tennyson's minor poems (Lincoln 4214), which he was soon to surrender to the poet's solicitors; so he can have had no commercial reason for refurbishing his original set of such poems by rechristening it The New Timon . After 29 January 1876, when the court's Perpetual Injunction descended upon him, Shepherd, so far as we know, refrained from all illegal traffic in Tennyson's works. It therefore seems possible to suggest that the agent was Harry Buxton Forman, and the date 1897-1899. This cannot be proved; but there seems to be no viable alternative. I am grateful for the courteous help of Mr Laurence Elwin and Ms Susan Gates, of the Lincoln City Libraries, and Mr Carey S. Bliss, Curator of Rare Books at the Huntington Library.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Additional Manuscripts of Faulkner's "A Dead Dancer" by Louis Daniel Brodsky</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To date the only versions of William Faulkner's early poem, "A Dead Dancer," which have been published are the three autograph manuscripts contained in the Faulkner Collections at the University of Virginia. 1 Additional manuscripts of this poem, however, are included in the William Faulkner Collection of Louis Daniel Brodsky. 2 The Brodsky documents, three of which are transcribed below, 3 make significant contributions to the bibliographical history of "A Dead Dancer." For one thing, the Brodsky materials provide evidence that the Virginia versions are incomplete, omitting as they do the conclusion of the poem. Moreover, one of the Brodsky texts, the partially-burned version of "A Dead Dancer" appearing in "The Lilacs," the hand-lettered booklet which Faulkner assembled and presented to Phil Stone in January 1920, 4 quite possibly represents Faulkner's final rendition of this poem. Brodsky 14a A comparison with Virginia 2 suggests that this untitled Brodsky manuscript is a fragment, the final two stanzas of an early version of the poem. The last stanza of Brodsky 14a is especially important; it suggests the possibility that Brodsky 14a could be the next in a series of revisionary drafts following Virginia 1, 5 or, indeed—perhaps more likely—a hitherto unknown continuation of Virginia 1. The hurdy-gurdy in the street below Still weaves the song across the silent street Like gold threads in an ancient tapestry And we that she had loved at different times Sit in the backwash of self consciousness Beyond the ebb and flow of Life and Death Seeing her on the backdrop of the brain Her long slow eyes and shaken hair, her breast Short with the love she felt, or seemed to feel ['If it was love' del .] Visions, flawless children of the brain While each one whispers to himself — I was the last. She dances now for apocryphal lovers In the dim aisles, with pale stirrings Of the white mouths of the dead, a wind That whispers in her shadowy garments. ['In her hair are poppies, ghosts of loves' del .] And in the poppies she wears in her hair And the foot-lights of her stage are asphodels ['And' del .] While her song, as it falls spreading into silence Like slow ripples on a placid stream at sunset Still loops and coils about her painted limbs Brodsky 14d This autograph manuscript contains three experimental versions of the final stanza of the poem. These versions are considerably different from both Brodsky 14a and the text Faulkner produced in "The Lilacs." One might speculate that Brodsky 14d is a continued reworking of Virginia 2, and that the initial two lines of this draft (14d), set off by themselves, are in fact the final two verses of the three-line stanza concluding Virginia 2. 6 She goes through calm vistas of the shadows Pale with stirrings of the white mouths of the dead About her are the white mouths of the dead Their voices, like a wind that whispers in her garments And in the poppies wreathed about her head While the foot lights of her stage are asphodels And her song, as it falls spreading into silence Still loops and coils about her painted legs About her now the white mouths of the dead Stir like a wind that whispers in her garments And in the poppies wreathed about her head While the foot lights of her stage are asphodels And her song, as it falls spreading into silence Still loops and coils about her painted legs Brodsky 17 The text of "A Dead Dancer" in "The Lilacs," like the remainder of the booklet, was partially destroyed by fire in 1942. However, through collation with other extant versions, one may reconstruct the "Lilacs" copy almost entirely. In the reconstruction printed below brackets enclose material missing in the burned copy. The manuscripts upon which these additions are based are identified at the end of each line. In some cases the apparent length of the line in the "Lilacs" text has dictated the choice among variant readings. 7 Interpolations are indicated by ed. In lines 13-14 reconstruction was impossible, since no corresponding versions of these lines exist in other manuscripts. 8 A DEA[D DANCER] V 1,3 We, that she had [loved at different] times V 1,2,3, B 14a Sit at dusk in diffident gutt[ering silence,] a ring V 1,2,3 Of ill-trimmed lamps, for [we dare not meet] V 1,3 Each other naked [in the dark.] V 2 —Is it relief we feel?

Freudenberg (1975), pp. 124, 131-133. These manuscripts are hereafter designated as Virginia 1, 2, and 3, in keeping with their numbering in Man Collecting . 2 See Robert W. Hamblin and Louis Daniel Brodsky, Selections from the William Faulkner Collection of Louis Daniel Brodsky: A Descriptive Catalogue (1979), items 14-14d, 17. For purposes of identification the numbering of these items in this catalogue has been retained. 3 The other two Brodsky documents relating to "A Dead Dancer" (Hamblin and Brodsky, 14b, 14c) contain experimental lines from an unidentified poem describing summer rain. Apparently this attempt was abandoned, but several of the images and phrases (most notably, "And we sit dreaming dreams beyond the ebb and flow / Of dying years") were utilized in "A Dead Dancer." 4 For a description of this booklet see Hamblin and Brodsky, pp. 31-32. 5 Both manuscripts are written in brown ink on 14 by 8½-inch Hammermill Bond paper. (In Man Collecting the paper-size of Virginia 1 is mistakenly identified as 11 by 8½ inches.) 6 Both autograph drafts are written in blunt pencil; all five lines represent revisionary attempts to clarify a similar set of images. 7 For example, the wording of lines 3, 11, and 19. Length-of-line considerations also influenced the omission in line 13 and the addition of "And" in line 18. 8 What at first appear to be good possibilities for the wording of line 13 (for example, "A little nameless tune") are negated by the fact that the top stems of two adjacent letters (perhaps b , d , f , h , k , l , and/or t ) are barely visible one-half inch to the left of the comma.</field>
