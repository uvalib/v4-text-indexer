      <field name="heading_text">The Prentice Hand in the Tragedies of the Shakespeare First Folio: Compositor E by Charlton Hinman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS LARGE BODIES OF hitherto unexploited bibliographical evidence in the Shakespeare First Folio is producing many surprising results. It is showing, for one thing, that much of the textual work of the past—much, indeed, that is now being done—proceeds from false premises. But on the positive side this analysis is making possible the reconstruction of the printing-house history of the volume in a fullness and with a precision that would have seemed impossible only a few years ago. In all of its major outlines, moreover, and also in many of its details, this reconstruction can be made with an almost absolute certainty. The evidence upon which it is based is for the most part physical and unequivocal, and leads to conclusions of which the validity is not subject to debate. Points are of course reached where probability must replace fact and speculation must replace demonstration; but inference can now be exercised within, and governed by, a very comprehensive structure of demonstrable truth. From the standpoint of Shakespearian textual study, perhaps the most important general fact recently discovered about the First Folio is that it was throughout set into type, not by successive pages, but by formes. Copy was therefore always "cast off" (often long in advance of actual setting and printing); and casting off commonly entailed various space-adjustment practices, some of which affected the text itself. The formes for a given quire were usually set by two compositors working simultaneously, one on each page of the forme in hand; for only thus could typesetting stay abreast of presswork, keeping the single press that printed the book more or less continuously supplied with Folio material. A preliminary report of these facts, together with certain observations about their textual implications, has already been made. 1 The present article is concerned with a more particular aspect of the printing of the Folio, though with one that involves some of the most important of Shakespeare's plays. The primary aim in what follows is to describe some of the irregularities that characterized the printing of the Tragedies, and to suggest that they all stem from the activities—and the limitations—of the very inexpert compositor who not only set Titus Andronicus, Romeo and Juliet , and certain pages of Troilus and Cressida but who also had a significant hand in Hamlet, King Lear , and Othello . That Titus and Romeo were not set by the regular Folio compositors, A and B, has been known for some time (see Note 8 below); but the most important facts about the third compositor of the Tragedies have not, I believe, been pointed out; nor has it been recognized that Compositor E, as I have designated him, is in part responsible for the Folio texts of Hamlet, Lear , and Othello . 2 His work in these major tragedies has in fact been confused with that of Compositor B—to B's considerable prejudice in our eyes, and to our own further confusion in trying to determine B's characteristics both here and elsewhere in the book. The salient facts about Compositor E—both what he did and how well or ill he did it—have so immediate a bearing upon various editions of particular plays now being prepared, and also upon certain more general textual studies now in progress, that it seems worthwhile to offer this preliminary statement at once. 3 The full story, with all of its supporting evidence, must be reserved for the comprehensive account of the printing and proof reading of the First Folio upon which I am now engaged. 4 What will be said in the present article about the order of formes followed in the Tragedies, about proof reading, and about various other matters is essentially factual. The most interesting thing about Compositor E, however, is inferential. Hence nothing further is claimed for a good part of the "argument" of this essay than that it appears to follow necessarily from the observed facts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Titus Andronicus and Romeo and Juliet Scores, even hundreds, of individual types become distinctive through injury as work on the First Folio goes forward. The precise point at which a given type suffered injury can frequently be observed, and the damaged type then traced in its subsequent appearances through the book. When large numbers of such types are catalogued and studied, very definite patterns of recurrence become apparent, and from these it is possible to determine many things about the printing of the book. One of these things is the exact order in which the various formes that make up the First Folio were set. 5 Throughout the Comedies and most of the Histories the progression was, on the whole, very regular. Setting usually began with the inner forme for the inner sheet; then came the outer forme for the same sheet, then the inner forme for the middle sheet—and so on. The sequence 6 was thus 3 v :4, 3:4 v , 2:5 v , 2:5 v , 1 v :6, 1:6 v and this order was followed so often, despite occasional deviations from it, that it can clearly be regarded as the normal order of formes within a quire. Normal too is progress from quire A to quire B, then from B to C—and so on, in regular alphabetic sequence. Here again exceptions must be made. Special circumstances sometimes produced irregularity in the order of the successive quires of the Comedies and Histories. Quire X was followed, not by quires Y and Z, but by quires a and b—though these were then followed by Y and Z. Other departures from strict alphabetic order are also found; but this regular order was nevertheless the one normally followed. Never, moreover, was the setting for a new quire begun before all six formes of the preceding quire were in type. Hence it is very surprising to find that the printing of the Tragedies was characterized by what at first appears to be extreme irregularity. Not merely does the progression both of formes and of quires seem abnormal, but it is distinctly exceptional for one quire to be finished before another, and usually one far removed from the first in the alphabetic sequence, is begun. Only very late, when quire tt is reached, is there a return to normal; and Antony and Cleopatra and Cymbeline are the only two plays in this section of the book that were printed with the same regularity that we find generally in the earlier sections. The change in procedure which produced these irregularities took place somewhat before the Histories had been finished. Quires t-x, containing the end of Richard III and the whole of Henry VIII , were not set immediately after quire s but only much later, after all of Macbeth and part of Hamlet had been printed. 7 Next set, after the completion of quire s in the Histories, were certain formes for quire aa—and work on the Tragedies was under way. But quire aa (containing Coriolanus pages) was still unfinished when one forme of quire dd (two pages of Titus Andronicus ) was set. And presently quire kk (part of Julius Caesar ) was composed; then another forme of quire dd, then two formes of quire ll (more of Caesar ) and another forme of dd ( Titus again). Four formes of quire bb ( Coriolanus ) were immediately followed by certain formes of quire mm ( Macbeth ) and of quire ee ( Titus and Romeo ). Later, after nn1:6 v ( Macbeth and Hamlet ) and then ff2:5 v ( Romeo ), came quire t ( Richard III and Henry VIII ); but other formes for Romeo and for pre-cancellation Troilus were worked before quires t-x (and hence, at last, the Histories) were finished. The final Romeo forme ( 2 gg1 v :2) was set between two formes of quire oo, for Hamlet . Quire Gg ( Timon of Athens ) was begun immediately after rr1:6 v ( King Lear ), but a start was made on quire ss (shared by Lear and Othello ) before Timon had been completed. This is surprising indeed, and at first seems not merely irregular but chaotic. Yet a certain method in this madness begins to emerge as soon as the order in which the successive formes were set is scrutinized in the light of information as to which compositors set them. The greater part of the First Folio was set by two compositors known as A and B. But Titus Andronicus and Romeo and Juliet are evidently the work of someone else—of the man to be referred to hereafter as Compositor E. 8 The work of A and B can almost always be identified quite positively by means of very simple spelling tests. E's spelling, however, although in some respects more like B's than like A's, is characterized by a wild mixture of many of the alternative spellings (notably do-doe and go-goe) that are most useful in distinguishing A and B. Thus pages set by E usually show an olio of certain spellings that is rarely found in the work of either A or B; and such a mixture occurs throughout Titus and Romeo . In these two plays, therefore, spellings alone may be taken as a sufficient basis for the identification of Compositor E—although, as will soon be seen, there are also other ways of determining what he set, and in later plays he can in fact be distinguished from A or B independently of spelling tests. In any event there can be no doubt that Compositor E set Titus and Romeo —or, in bibliographical terms, part of quire cc and all of quires dd, ee, ff, and 2 gg (the last being the two-leaf quire at the end of Romeo that immediately follows quire ff). In the light of this fact a re-examination of the order of formes in the Tragedies proves highly instructive. The entire sequence cannot be considered here, but a representative part of it will at once make clear the essential nature of the whole. The following sequence, indeed, is thoroughly typical of the progression from the first forme of quire aa to the third forme of quire pp—immediately after which a very significant change, to be described in due course, took place. Beginning, then, with the first forme of quire mm, work on the Tragedies proceeded thus (the upper-case letter above each page-designator showing which compositor set that page): The formes set by Compositor E have been underscored for the sake of clarity. It will be seen at once that if these formes are omitted the progress is absolutely regular in quires mm-nn and t-v. The six formes of mm were set in what we have already seen to be the normal order within a given quire, and mm was followed by quire nn where precisely the same order of formes is found. At this point—with the composition, that is, of quire nn—further work on the Tragedies by A and B was temporarily suspended while these compositors set the three quires (t-x) that finally brought the Histories to completion. The order of formes within quires t and v (and also x, which followed) is again, however, absolutely normal. And it may be added that when quires t-x had been finished a return was made to quire oo, the next quire in the alphabetic sequence of the Tragedies, where again the normal order of formes within the quire was followed, as it was also in succeeding quires. Also apparent is the fact that the formes set by Compositor E themselves show normal order. No two of them are immediately consecutive within the larger sequence; but omit the material set by A and B and the progression in what remains is again completely regular, always from inner to outer forme and from inner to middle to outer sheet; and quire ff follows quire ee in the proper alphabetic order. Thus what we seem to find is a very regular progression of formes within two independent but mixed sequences. The appearance is in some respects misleading, as will be seen; but regularity—method of some sort—is patent. It should also be noticed that the first three formes of quire mm were set mostly by Compositor A, Compositor B having no part whatever in mm3:4 v ; and that B alone, on the other hand, set the first four formes of quire nn and also one forme (v2 v :5) of quire v. Although A and B together set most of the 24 formes of quires mm-nn and t-v, each compositor is sometimes found setting one or more formes by himself. This, too, is typical of the whole Coriolanus-Hamlet progression; and it is important in showing that each of the two regular Folio compositors was fairly often required somewhere else than at work on Shakespeare. 9 Both A and B, moreover, were sometimes absent, and many of the formes set by E can only have been put into type at such times. For Compositor E always worked from one or the other of the two type-cases that were used in the printing of the First Folio; and formes set by E are often found between formes that were jointly produced by A and B using the only cases of First Folio text type anywhere available in Jaggard's shop. See, for example, ee1:6 v . The immediately preceding forme, mm1 v :6, was set by A and B working together, one at each of the two cases; and neither of these cases can have been available to E, of course, while A and B were using both of them. Probably the two pages of mm1 v :6 were not finished at exactly the same time, and one case was doubtless vacated, as it were, somewhat before the other. But the two pages of mm1:6 v , the forme immediately after ee1:6 v , were also set by A and B together. Thus there can be little doubt that both A and B were absent while most, at least, of ee1:6 v was set; and that they returned at approximately the same time to work together on mm1:6 v . And precisely the same considerations apply to ff2 v :5, 2:5 v , 1 v :6, and 1:6 v . Five of the eight Titus-Romeo formes in the present sequence appear—and can be shown to have been set—between formes jointly worked by A and B. Form ee1 v :6, moreover, although it was not set from the case used by Compositor A to set mm4 v , was set from the same case as that from which A set his next page, mm2 v . 10 Hence A (as well as B, who set nothing between column a of mm4 and column b of mm5 in the present sequence) must have been absent during the setting of at least part of ee1 v :6; and similar evidence shows that B as well as A must have been elsewhere when ff3 v was set. Thus only ff3:4 v —only one of the eight Titus-Romeo formes in our sequence—can have been set throughout simultaneously with any of the material in this sequence that was set by A and B or either of them. This point is emphasized in order to show that the setting done by the third compositor of the Tragedies was not done independently of the work done by A and B and simultaneously with it. The third compositor never worked from a third type-case; and the same skeleton that is used for what is set by A and B is always used with E's formes as well. 11 Both A-B formes and E formes therefore quite certainly belong in a single sequence, are integral parts of one operation—in which, however, a forme set by E is always a kind of substitute for an A-B forme and is never set except in the absence of at least one of the regular compositors. Thus Compositor E set only what may properly be called the intercalary formes of the sequence; and the otherwise orderly progression of the regular formes is larded with intercalary material set by a substitute compositor when one or both of the regular compositors had to be elsewhere. In this is the essential puzzle. All would be understandable enough if only it could be shown that Compositor E set certain plays while A and B worked independently on others. Thus we should indeed have quite separate sequences of formes, each following a normal order and each produced pari passu with the other in a two-part operation obviously designed to hasten the composition of the book. Yet, as we have seen, it is perfectly certain that we do not have two really separate sequences. And why should Compositor E, although acting only as a substitute for A or B or both of them, always work on different pages altogether, always set other quires than those being set by the regular compositors? There is, I believe, only one explanation that accounts both for the irregular order of formes described above and for certain other phenomena found later in the book: Compositor E was incapable of setting manuscript material acceptably . It was indeed desired, not so much to speed up work on the Tragedies as to avoid at least some of the delay caused by the absences of one or both of the regular compositors who were so often required temporarily elsewhere. Compositor E kept work on the Shakespeare folio going forward. His activities, however, were necessarily confined to printed copy; and hence formes for Titus and Romeo (set from printed quartos) are found scattered among formes for Coriolanus, Caesar, Macbeth , and Henry VIII (all set from manuscript copy). Some of the most striking evidence upon which this suggestion is based is encountered only after the point in quire pp at which the alternation between regular and intercalary formes ceases, another method of working is adopted, and E is found in an important new role. This will be described in due course, and the whole of the evidence as to E's chief limitation can then be reviewed. First, however, certain facts about E's earlier activities should be noticed. (1) The Folio text of Titus Andronicus contains one scene (III.ii) not found in the quarto. This scene (about 85 lines, falling partly in dd3 v and partly in dd4) must have been set from manuscript copy and was undoubtedly set by Compositor E. Once, therefore, E did set from manuscript. Now it cannot be determined, in the absence of the copy itself, precisely how well or ill Compositor E managed to reproduce the manuscript text of Titus III.ii—or, of course, how long it took him. But Professor H. T. Price, now preparing the New Variorum edition of Titus , has assured me that this scene is certainly one of the most corrupt passages in the play. Which, considering the rest of Folio Titus , seems to be saying a good deal. 12 (2) Whatever E's capabilities with respect to manuscript copy, it is clear that he could not set even printed copy well. This is almost immediately apparent to anyone who will examine Folio Titus and Romeo with half a proof reader's eye. They are full of errors, and of errors not found in the printed quartos from which they were set. The liberties which Compositor B was wont to take with copy may create more serious problems for an editor than some of the more obvious bungling of Compositor E. But B's shortcomings are not due to inexperience or lack of mechanical skill. E's work, on the other hand, usually seems to reflect both. It inevitably suggests, not the swift though careless expert, but the tyro. Hence it is especially interesting to note that E was apparently expected to make a great many errors. In striking contrast with much of the material set by A and B in the Tragedies, practically everything that Compositor E set, not only in Titus and Romeo but elsewhere, was proof read. E's deficiencies were evidently well known to his superiors, and all that he did was subject to more or less systematic review. He was certainly not, in this respect at least, on the same footing in Jaggard's printing house as Compositors A and B. 13 (3) As we trace the whole progress of the printing of the Tragedies from Coriolanus to Hamlet we observe that Compositor E's activities gradually change. He begins by setting a page (dd3 v ) from B's cases without any of the immediately prior distribution of wrought-off material that is normally the first step in setting a new page. Then, more regularly, he distributes s1 and sets his second page (dd4). A little later we find that he is usually distributing considerably more material than he sets, and hence that the regular compositor who presently returns to the case at which E has been working finds it already well supplied with type and is able to proceed at once, without preliminary distribution, to the setting of his next page. E is being used for extra distribution—to the advantage of the regular compositors, now one and then the other. 14 Soon after this, moreover, there is a further development. Compositor A set column b of mm4 and then all of mm3:4 v (see p. 8). But when he finished setting mm4 from what may be called the x case, he proceeded to set mm3 from the y case, then moved back to the x case to set mm4 v . This looks very much as if E were here doing A's distributing for him—so that A could devote his whole time to setting. 15 There is no sudden and striking increase in foul case in the Tragedies: Compositor E could obviously distribute better than he could set. This, too, his superiors appear to have recognized and exploited. In any event it is patent that here, in B's absence, E did not set any part of quire mm. And this would be strange indeed if E were a fully qualified typesetter and could have functioned in B's place by setting one page of forme mm3:4 v —strange, that is, unless E was unable to set manuscript copy with sufficient speed and accuracy to warrant his being employed on it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. Hamlet, Lear , and Othello The complete sequence in which intercalary formes are encountered among regular formes is a long one, embracing six complete plays and parts of three others—a total of some 89 formes. Compositors A and B set Coriolanus, Caesar, Macbeth , the end of Richard III, Henry VIII , and about half of Hamlet . And E set Titus, Romeo , and part of Troilus . Only twice in the whole Coriolanus-Hamlet progression do two intercalary formes appear consecutively. And such formes usually appear, not only singly, but between small groups of regular formes. Thus E's work on Titus and Romeo got on only slowly. Eventually, however, he completed the last forme for quire ff and is presently found at work on a quire containing both the final pages of Romeo and the early ones of Troilus and Cressida . The evidence by which it is possible to show precisely how much of Troilus was in type before work on this play was discontinued does not concern us here. It need only be said that a beginning was made on a regular six-leaf quire containing the end of Romeo and the beginning of Troilus but that it was decided to stop work on Troilus long before this quire had been finished and at about the time A and B completed the setting of Henry VIII and resumed work on quire oo for Hamlet . In consequence of this decision Compositor E prepared two formes for a one-sheet quire (present 2 gg; pages 73-76) and Romeo and Juliet was finished independently of Troilus . 16 Forme 2 gg1 v :2, the second of the two formes for quire 2 gg, is thus the forme with which E's work for Romeo came to an end. And it is also the last forme set by E that appears between two regular formes set by A and B. A new development now takes place. Its nature will at once be suggested by another short sequence. The progression of formes from 001 v :6 through pp2:5 v was as follows: Through pp3:4 v this sequence is clearly of a piece with the one given on page 8 above. A and B together ultimately set three of the four regular formes, but A was required elsewhere before he had set all of 001, and B therefore finished 001 and set all of the next forme, pp3 v :4. E, as always, set the intercalary forme; and the next forme was set jointly by A and B. But pp4 v is Compositor A's last page. He reappears briefly, after even the preliminaries had been finished, to share one final task with Compositor B: except for two pages earlier set by E and preserved, the present Folio text of Troilus was set by A and B working together once more. But Compositor A had nothing to do with any page of Hamlet after pp4 v —nor with any of the following Tragedies right through Cymbeline . And A's place as B's partner was taken by Compositor E, beginning with pp5. This is made perfectly clear by various kinds of evidence. Types show conclusively that two different men, working from different cases, set the different pages of pp2 v :5 and pp2:5 v —as well as of many later formes. Spellings indicate that neither of these was A, that one of them was B, and that the other uses the same mixture of certain A and B spellings that have been noticed in E's earlier work in Titus and Romeo . And above all, perhaps, the quality of the setting done by this man continues to reflect the same inexpertness so obvious in the earlier plays. Hence the following facts about the seven formes listed above are of interest: (a) there are no press-variants in any of the pages of the formes that were set by either A or B; (b) both pages of E's forme 2 gg1 v :2 are press-variant; (c) both pp2 v :5 and 2:5 v are press-variant but the variants are in each case confined to but one page of the forme: pp5 and 5 v , the two pages set by the compositor who here replaces A as B's partner, show numerous press-corrections. It may be added that most of the later work of this man was also proof read. Titus and Romeo , it has been noticed, are remarkable for the large number of their formes that were proofed and corrected. Only in Hamlet, Lear , and Othello do we find similar concentrations of press-variants. Thus types, spellings, quality of setting, an unusual amount of press-correction—all point one way: Compositor E set pp5 and 5 v ; and similar evidence shows that he also set many subsequent pages in quires pp-ss. Nor is this surprising, viewed in the light of the whole course that the printing of the Tragedies had followed up to this point. With the setting of 2 gg1 v :2 Compositor E had finished all of the material on which he had so far been working: Titus was in print, the last forme of Romeo was about to be printed, and work on Troilus had been indefinitely postponed. E had demonstrated that, although what he set might require more proof reading than the work of A or B, he could be useful; and A was needed for other tasks. Compositor E was therefore put to work with B and on what was for him fresh material— Hamlet to begin with—and A went elsewhere. In due course, to be sure, E also disappears. Quires Gg-hh and tt-bbb ( Timon , most of Othello , and all of Antony and Cymbeline ) were set wholly by B. Compositor B did not work alone, however, on the last formes of quire pp nor on quires qq-ss; and the following pages of the Folio texts of Hamlet, Lear , and Othello were set by Compositor E: pp5, 5 v , 6, 6 v ; qq2 v , 3, 4, 4 v , 5 v , 6, 6 v ; rr1, 1 v (in part), 2, 3 (the greater part; ss1 v , 2, 2 v , 3 v , 4, 4 v , 5, 5 v , 6. Certain peculiarities in the later tragedies of the Folio—in the plays set after A's departure, that is—throw additional light on E's capabilities and limitations. Three of these may be mentioned. (1) The Folio text of King Lear , as has long been known, was set from a quarto that had been extensively "corrected" through collation with a manuscript version of the play. The copy must have been considerably more difficult than that used for Titus or Romeo . Hence it may be very significant that Compositor E did not set certain pages of Lear that would ordinarily have fallen into his stint. 17 When two compositors work together on successive quires of the First Folio, the compositor who sets the pages for the second half of one quire ($4-6 v ) also sets those for the first half of the next ('$1-3 v ). Thus we find, for example: This is the almost invariable practice throughout the book, and it is the obvious consequence of a simple division of large blocks of the copy: Compositor A held the copy for a continuous sequence of pages from the middle of quire t to the middle of quire v (t4-v3 v ); B held the copy for the preceding pages of quire t and for the pages from the middle of quire v to the middle of the following quire. Nor is this way of dividing copy ever permanently upset by other demands upon the workmen in question. One compositor often sets both pages of one or more formes for a quire for which both nevertheless do some setting: Compositor A may be temporarily absent, and his block of copy is at such times turned over to B so that the necessary formes (each containing, of course, one page from each half of the quire) can be kept going to press. When A returns, however, he resumes work on his block of copy. The result of this practice—and the evidence shows a remarkable constancy in it—is that the same compositor does not set both early and late pages for the same quire unless he is working alone and therefore setting some pages for the absent partner whose block of the copy he temporarily holds. When both compositors are present we simply do not find, normally, either one of them setting both early and late pages of the quire in hand. Quire qq is triply anomalous in this respect. What we find is this: Compositor E set the late pages of quire pp, B the early. Hence we should expect E to set the early pages of quire qq (1-3 v ) and B the late pages (qq4-6 v ); but the reverse is true. Yet not wholly so: E set the earlier page (qq2 v ) and B the later page (qq5) of the first forme after qq3:4 v , which had been set wholly by E. After qq2 v :5, however, another switch was made and E set the late pages (qq5 v , 6, and 6 v ), B the early pages (qq2, 1 v , and 1), of the last three formes. This can only mean that the copy for quire qq was most irregularly divided—or else, and more probably, that there were highly irregular exchanges between E and B of normally divided copy. Which of these alternatives better accounts for the observed facts is irrelevant. The result is in either case the same: certain pages that would normally have been the responsibility of one compositor were in fact set by the other. Since each page set anomalously by one compositor implies a corresponding page set anomalously by his partner, the irregularities are reciprocal and can be described in terms of what either compositor did, and did not, set. The departures from normal may therefore be listed as follows: (a) B set qq3 v , instead of qq4, at the beginning of the quire; (b) B set qq5, instead of qq2 v , and (c) B then set qq2 instead of qq5 v . Compositor B also set qq1 v and 1 instead of qq6 and 6 v ; but this irregularity is probably only a consequence of the shift that gave him the copy for qq2, the early page in the forme that immediately preceded qq1 v :6 and 1:6 v . That no further abnormal shifts were made is indicated by his proceeding quite regularly from the early pages of quire qq (2, 1 v , and 1) to the late pages of quire rr. What, then, does all this mean? That normal practice was not followed is a matter of demonstrable fact; but why should the copy for certain pages of quire qq (one and a half pages of Hamlet and 10 pages of Lear ) be subject to such special treatment? Why, more specifically, should the copy for qq3 v , 5, and 2—all of which are pages in King Lear —be so manipulated as to fall to B rather than to his less skillful partner? We cannot be sure. One explanation, however, immediately suggests itself. The copy for Lear cannot have been easy, and parts of it must have been more or less excessively annotated. Was the copy for these three pages too hard for Compositor E—or at least difficult enough to make advisable the anomalous exchanges that have been noticed? The inference is consistent with other indications of E's inability to deal efficiently with all kinds of copy; and no other explanation seems to accord so well with all that we know both of Folio Lear and of the compositors who set it. 18 It may be added, finally, that a similar manipulation of copy is found in quire ss (shared by Lear and Othello ) —where ss3, again a page of Lear , was set by Compositor B, but set from copy that would normally have fallen to Compositor E. These irregularities in quires qq and ss, in each case involving the copy for Lear , are without parallel elsewhere in the Tragedies. 19 (2) Work on Troilus as the immediate successor to Romeo and Juliet was only well begun when it was abruptly discontinued; but the gap thus left between Romeo and Caesar (long since printed) was not quickly filled. It was eventually filled, though very imperfectly, by Timon of Athens . The printing of Timon (and with it a reset version of the last half-page of Romeo ) thus appears to mark the final abandonment of the original plan for Troilus . In any event, Timon (quires Gg and hh) was not begun until after quire rr had been set—and set jointly by E and B. The new E-B partnership had been established and was working. It had completed quire pp, produced quires qq and rr, and was presently to turn out quire ss. But Timon of Athens , which falls between quires rr and ss, was set wholly by Compositor B. Compositor E was at hand during part of the interval, for he appears to have done the distributing that immediately preceded B's setting, first of Gg3, then of Gg4 v ; and he clearly set part of quire ss while B was at work on the later pages of Timon : forme ss3 v :4 is in fact an intercalary forme, set wholly by E, between the fourth and fifth formes of quire hh; and the second ss forme, also wholly by E, falls between the last hh forme and an ss forme set jointly by B and E. The partners, in short, were both available; but one of them had no share whatever in the setting of Timon of Athens . Again, therefore, we find a highly irregular method of working, but also one that is eminently reasonable if Compositor E was unable to deal competently with the manuscript copy from which Folio Timon must have been set. (3) Compositor E finally disappears from the Folio picture after quire ss. It is a little surprising that he had no hand in quires tt-vv, into which the greater part of Othello falls. It is not surprising, however, that Antony and Cymbeline were set wholly by B. Like Timon , the last two plays in the Tragedies can only have been set from manuscript copy. Compositor B set ss1:6 v , but most of quire ss, including all of the first six pages of Othello , was E's work. After setting ss6, however, E is seen no more. His disappearance thus coincides very closely with the end of the first act of Othello , only the last 19 lines of which fall in ss6 v and so were set by B. It is therefore tempting to suppose that the copy for all but Act I of Othello was, as parts of the Lear copy seem to have been, beyond E's powers—perhaps because more heavily annotated than the copy for Act I. Possibly this suggestion is worth testing; but if so it must certainly be tested by other evidence than what is provided by the bibliographical peculiarities of the First Folio alone—where there is little to show that Compositor E was not simply required elsewhere after setting ss6, and did not again become available for work on the Shakespeare Folio until after Othello had been completed. Yet it may be mentioned that, whereas E's last four pages are not press-variant, an unusually large number of the remaining pages of Othello , all set by B, are so. Why this should be can hardly be said out of hand; but it is at least consistent with the hypothesis that the copy for Act I was relatively easy, while the copy for the rest of the play was more difficult and considered likely to give rise to serious error.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. Summary: Compositer E That the same compositor who set Titus and Romeo and pre-cancellation Troilus also set certain pages of Hamlet, Lear , and Othello cannot seriously be doubted. That he was very inexpert is also demonstrable. But that this man, Compositor E, was incapable of setting manuscript material acceptably and was therefore allowed to set printed copy only—this, of course, is inferential. It cannot be absolutely proved. Hence the way of prudence would be to eschew, as possibly not fully established, the proposition that Folio Hamlet and Othello were, like Folio Lear , set from annotated quartos, and to suggest no more than that Compositor E was not ordinarily employed on manuscript copy. Nevertheless—and without any wish to commit myself overenthusiastically to folly—I feel bound to say that the inference that E could not competently set manuscript material seems to me inescapable. It is eminently consistent with everything that has so far been observed about the printing of the Tragedies, and it explains a whole complex of phenomena, large and small, that are otherwise inexplicable. The strange but evidently methodical switching back and forth between regular and intercalary formes in the earlier part of the Tragedies is simply incredible unless Compositor E was for some reason obliged to set only certain texts (all of which were in fact set from printed copy) and was not permitted to work on any of the material (all of it in fact set from manuscript copy) upon which A and B were engaged, even though he acted only as a substitute for one or both of them in this part of the book. And the inference is strengthened by evidence that E did not function as a fully qualified substitute at times when his doing so would have had manifest advantages. It is not merely that we should expect a qualified substitute simply to continue, in the absence of the regulars, from the point where they left off. There are many formes throughout the earlier Tragedies that were set wholly by A or by B alone. Compositor E may here be found distributing type for the benefit of the regular compositor who remains at work on the Shakespeare folio, a practice that would have speeded up operations slightly ; but maximum speed-up is never attempted: E never serves as a full partner, never sets type. And the same thing happens after A's disappearance. E now works as B's partner on the end of Hamlet , on Lear , and on the beginning of Othello ; but joint setting by E and B is interrupted while B alone sets Timon , just as he later set all of Antony and Cymbeline . Thus the evidence as a whole—and it has a remarkable coherence throughout the Tragedies—seems almost to force the conclusion that Compositor E was not regarded as competent to deal with manuscript copy; and that he was never, after setting III.ii of Titus , permitted to do so again. 20 Compositor E's precise status in the Jaggard establishment is not of very great importance; but that he was an apprentice is suggested by many considerations. Whatever his capabilities with respect to manuscript copy, he appears to have been less expert than we can reasonably suppose any full-fledged typesetter of the time would have been, and it is clear that his superiors were perfectly familiar with his limitations and considered it necessary to proof read most, at least, of what he set. He was not supplied with type-cases and working space of his own, and he is occasionally found doing some of the more routine work of the regular Folio compositors. Compositor E may not, of course, have been an indentured apprentice of Jaggard's house; yet there is certainly some warrant for referring to his work for the First Folio as that of a prentice hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 See my "Cast-off Copy for the First Folio of Shakespeare," Shakespeare Quarterly , VI (1955), 259-273. 2 E, rather than C or D, because not all of the material before the Tragedies was set by A and B, and C and D may later be required to designate compositors in the Comedies. 3 See Alice Walker, "Some Editorial Principles," Studies in Bibliography , VIII (1956), 95-111. How important it is that as much as possible be learned about the compositors of the First Folio is here set forth, and illustrated, with Dr. Walker's usual incisiveness. 4 The bibliographical pecularities of the First Folio have lately produced a wealth of unexpected new information, not only about how the book was produced but also about the men who printed it and the materials from which they worked. (There is even evidence indicating that the copy for Folio Timon of Athens was in two different hands—only one of which, of course, can have been Shakespeare's.) But new investigative techniques have had to be developed, and the evidence has had to be dug for and recorded and analyzed before it could be understood. Hence my study of the printing of the First Folio has taken much more time than was originally planned for it. I hope to have it completed, however, by the end of 1957. 5 Strictly speaking, individual types are but the primary tools, not the only ones, used in this determination. Other kinds of evidence are sometimes essential. Rules, in particular, are invaluable in the Tragedies —as Dr. John Schroeder's forthcoming book (of which I have seen the dissertation version) will show. I should like to suggest, however, on the basis of an entirely independent study of the rules used in the Folio, that evidence from "box" rules alone has very real limitations. It can generally tell us only the order in which successive groups of formes were printed; and even this testimony, when unconfirmed by other evidence, can be—and sometimes is—seriously misleading. The order of individual formes can be absolutely determined only by a study of individual types—or of these in combination with evidence from rules (both "box" and "center"), from pagenumber errors, running titles, and the like. 6 Recto pages , here and hereafter, are indicated by leaf-numbers: only versos are given superscripts. 7 Difficulties about Henry VIII can alone be supposed responsible for this. The last three and a half pages of Richard III were evidently delayed only because these pages fall at the beginning of quire t, and so share four formes of this quire with pages of Henry VIII , which begins on t3. Thus the lateness of the final pages of Richard III has no special significance—though conceivably it may have some bearing on the fact that most of the last scene of the Folio text is based upon Q3 instead of the annotated Q6 that served as copy for most of the rest of the play. 8 Dr. Willoughby observed, more than twenty years ago, that A and B appear to have had nothing to do with Romeo ; and it has since been recognized that Titus and Romeo were set by the same hand. Thus we find, in an article by the late Philip Williams in the preceding volume of these Studies , "I have [not] yet been able satisfactorily to identify the compositor who set the folio texts of Titus Andronicus and Romeo and Juliet and whose work [I] suspect in other plays." See Studies in Bibliography , VIII (1956), 12. But it should be noted that Dr. Walker dissents. She believes that Romeo and most of Titus were set by Compositor B (whom she also considers solely responsible for the setting of Othello ). I find that one page of Titus , the very first (cc4), was set by Compositor B; that B also set, or rather reset, the last half page of the present Folio text of Romeo ; but that Titus and Romeo are otherwise entirely E's work, as are also the second and third pages of the Troilus text now found in the Folio. 9 This is not the place to discuss the possible reasons for these absences. Suffice it to say here that they were frequent but usually short, and that the overall evidence strongly suggests that most of them were caused by the demands of occasional lots of job printing—though illness, drunkenness, or mere truancy (to mention only a few of many possible causes) may sometimes have resulted in brief absences. The observed facts do not warrant the supposition that either A or B worked on any large project—another of the Jaggard folios, for example—during the absences that so often retarded the work on Shakespeare's tragedies. Not, that is, until A's very long absence, to be noticed again later, beginning just after he finished setting pp4 v . 10 The evidence by which it can be determined from which case a given page was set cannot be described here. But the determination can usually be made with great certainty. (For the sake of simplicity I here use "case" to indicate a "set of cases". Strictly speaking, of course, one or more sets of cases are used to print a book.)Neither A nor B always used the same type-case. When both compositors were absent, for example, the first of them to return did not always return to the same case he had used just before going elsewhere. Thus A, after setting mm4 v from one case, set mm2 v from the other—and from the same one that E used in setting ee1 v :6. So mm2 v cannot have been started until ee1 v :6 had been finished. A, therefore, cannot have set mm2 v immediately after mm4 v : there was an interval in which A was absent. 11 It has long been known that only one skeleton was used throughout the Tragedies, and this has seemed very strange. It is no whit stranger in the Tragedies than elsewhere, however, once the independent-sequence hypothesis is abandoned, as it now evidently must be. 12 Although the initial direction calls for " A Bnaket ", the scene does not show, I think, an extraordinary large number of obvious compositor's errors—the errors with which the proof reader was chiefly concerned—and no really important changes were effected. More press-corrections were in fact made in the 85 lines set from manuscript than in the approximately 170 other lines in the forme, the lines set from the quarto; yet the main fault found with E's setting of Titus III.ii may well have been simply that it was slow. Speed seems to have been at least as important as accuracy in Jaggard's shop. (Else B's work would certainly have been proof read more than it was.) 13 In an article published in these Studies three years ago, when I was only well started on my investigation of the bibliographical peculiarities of the First Folio and still knew very little either of the order of formes in the Tragedies or of Compositor E, I observed that the Folio text of Romeo , unlike other play-texts in this part of the book, contains a large number of press-variant formes; that Romeo is "peculiar in the abundance of obvious errors that both its corrected and uncorrected states show"; and that in these respects " Titus is much more like Romeo than are the others". The proof reading for Romeo and Titus was sometimes neither prompt nor careful; yet an unusually large number of the formes for these plays were proofed. See "The Proof-Reading of the First Folio Text of Romeo and Juliet ," Studies in Bibliography , VI (1953-54), 61-70. A number of additional press-variant formes have been found since this article was written, most of them in Titus . 14 Precisely how much and what material was distributed, and when, can almost always be determined by means of the individual types used in printing the Folio. As a rule there can also be little doubt as to who did the distributing, though this can never be really proved. 15 There seems no other reasonable explanation for the demonstrable fact that A changed cases just before setting mm3, then changed back again just before setting mm4 v . 16 Not quite completely finished, however, since the closing lines that now appear in Gg1 (mispaged 79) were set somewhat later and by Compositor B—evidently only when all hope of having Troilus follow Romeo in the completed book had been finally abandoned (see below). 17 The word stint has so often been used to denote the material set by one compositor before he was relieved by another that it is likely to suggest alternate setting by two compositors working on successive pages. It should not of course, be supposed to imply such setting in the First Folio.A new and therefore unfamiliar line of argument is pursued in the following analysis, and the reader may find it neither easy nor, as to its conclusion, so compelling as I believe it to be. The peculiarities to be discussed are nevertheless so unusual that I am reluctant to leave them unmentioned. 18 Pages qq3 v and 2 are somewhat more suspect than qq5, since the abnormality of qq2 v :5 may show only that, after his temporary absence (while E alone set qq3:4 v ), B accidentally failed to take back the same block of copy that he had used to set qq3 v . E may already have started work on qq2 v when B reappeared. The switches after pp1:6v and qq2 v :5, on the other hand, can hardly have been accidental. 19 Hamlet and Othello were also set, I take it, from annotated quartos; and these must sometimes have made more difficult copy than some manuscripts—clean scribal transcripts, for example. But there is no evidence that either the last five and a half pages of Hamlet or the first six of Othello were considered beyond the combined powers of Compositor E and the proof reader who reviewed his work. 20 Titus III.ii happens, incidentally, to occupy parts of dd3 v :4—with which Compositor E makes his initial appearance in the Tragedies of the First Folio.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Notes on the Text of T. S. Eliot: Variants from Russell Square by Robert L. Beare *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ON THE LAST DAY OF THIS SYMPOSIUM ** THERE should be a special pièce-de-resistance for the audience, but I see no way of finding one. It cannot be proved bibliographically that a previously unknown strophe of "Prufrock" was printed as part of a poem by Vachel Lindsay in a careless compositor's moment of indulgence, nor that "The Waste Land" was in actuality a copybook exercise for Smith Academy with our present text being a reported version of foul copy. But there are compensations for this: 'Significance' being defined in my small dictionary in such a fashion that we can discuss the importance of a thing, its expressiveness, the inference to be drawn from it, and even the reason why a thing is not void of meaning. We might, therefore, be able to spend some time upon the absence of textual variants, assuming that there were none, for that might also be of some significance. Rather than the grand gesture, the spectacular change, the fluctuations which are to be found in Eliot's works, sometimes in generous fashion, represent to me the problems in textual analysis which we find most frequently and which are most difficult to deal with. Sometime ago I had occasion to quote from Thomas A Becket's speech as he first enters: "Peace. And let them be, in their exaltation". I looked it up in an English copy of Murder in the Cathedral and found that these lines read as follows: They know and do not know, that action is suffering And suffering is action. Neither does the agent suffer Nor the patient act. instead of the reading half-familiar to me: They know and do not know, that action is suffering And suffering is action. Neither does the actor suffer Nor the patient act. 1 Although the change seemed quite clearly related to Aristotle's discussion of the performance of just actions, it led me to compare other parts of this play and then the rest of Eliot's work. As time went on, a sizeable collection of variants, although with no special regard to significance, piled up. It was somewhat startling because of the contrast to the mental image of a fastidious, precise, hard-working author, who was also in the fortunate position of being a member of the firm which published his books. That they exist at all, then, may be their prime significance. Since they are present, let us try to examine the various stages of his work in which they exist. There may be those fortunate authors whose works are written in a beautiful Renaissance hand in one draft without a single change. But for most writers composition can be a rather painful business. From all that Eliot has said, the writing of poetry is a time-consuming effort. Most of the poems have required more than one draft, while the plays, according to an interview in the newspaper, have taken three drafts, or more: one being for the idea of the play, one aimed at the mechanics of stage production, and one in which the effort was devoted to polishing the lines. Some scenes from the plays and some of the poems, undoubtedly, required more drafts and some less. Of the poems, "Marina" represents one of the best examples of the evolution of the poem from the first draft, in this case a pencil holograph, through later typescripts to the proof copies and the published version. 2 Not all of the poems and the plays have holographs for their first drafts. In the earlier stages of "Marina" we find nothing which would change the published text, but we do have an interesting insight into Eliot's composition. The first few lines read in the manuscript: What seas, what shores, what grey rocks, what islands, What water lapping the bow And scent of pine, and the wood thrush singing through the fog (Off Roque Island) What old forgotten images return And form themselves around—O my daughter In the typescripts and proof copies they run: What seas what shores what grey rocks and what islands What water lapping the bow And scent of pine and the woodthrush singing through the fog What images return And reform around—O my daughter. The final published version shows one further change in the deletion of "And reform around—". Here we see clearly a tendency which is also visible in some of the published texts from printing to printing: the elimination of punctuation and the deletion of words and phrases to achieve concentration. The next lines are also interesting. In the holograph there are minor changes in phrasing and a different order: Those who sharpen the tooth of the dog, meaning Death Those who suffer the ecstasy of the animals, meaning Death Those who glitter with the glory of the peacock, meaning Death Those who fail in the stye of contentment, meaning Death In the first typescript we find the order and phrasing of the published version: Those who sharpen the tooth of the dog, meaning Death Those who glitter with the glory of the hummingbird, meaning Death Those who sit in the stye of contentment, meaning Death Those who suffer the ecstasy of the animals, meaning Death Between the first and the second typescript there are only minor differences, the second being basically a clean copy of the first. Mr. Eliot notes that from the beginning there has been an inaccuracy in the text at this point, for "stye" should be "sty", thus eliminating some possible untoward associations. 3 As late as the proof copies there is an extra line, following line 20. Between the holograph and the typescripts the extra line was rephrased and was finally deleted only in the published form as an Ariel poem. Somewhat the same picture is true of other typescripts I have seen, and leads me to the general statement that the poems and plays appear in a form nearest the author's intention in the final copies offered for public sale. The study, therefore, of the stages of a poem or play which precede publication are of interest and significance for the genesis of the poem rather than as a check of its final published form. Even periodical publication, I feel, does not, therefore, necessarily reflect the final form of a poem. To make this clear, let us take "Difficulties of a Statesman" from the unfinished sequence, "Coriolan". This was published first in Commerce , (XXIX, Hiver 1931/32), and then in Hound and Horn , (VI, Oct./Dec., 1932). It next appeared in the Faber Book of Modern Verse , edited by Michael Roberts (February, 1936) and then in the Faber Collected Poems 1909-1935 (April, 1936). Line 26 appeared in P 1 as "Fireflies flare against the faint sheet lightning in nights of July." In P 2 and A 1 it appears as "Fireflies flare against the faint sheet lightning," and again in the Collected Poems in this latter form but without the comma at the end of the line. In P 1,2 and A 1 line 36 reads: "O mother (not one of these busts all correctly inscribed)". In the Collected Poems 1909-1935 the line has been changed: "O mother (not among these busts, all correctly inscribed)". Line 42 has a comma following 'impetrations' in P 1 and B 1 but not in P 2 and A 1 . Again in line 49, in the first three appearances, we find a difference in the phrasing when compared to the last appearance: "The small creatures chirp thinly through the dust, in the night." becoming "The small creatures chirp thinly through the dust, through the night.". Two further examples may be of interest. In periodical publication the line from "East Coker," "That will not leave us, but prevents us everywhere." formerly read, "That will not leave us, but torments us everywhere." In the first part of "Little Gidding" there is an interesting example of deletion between the periodical publication and the publication in pamphlet form: Where is the summer, the unimaginable [Summer beyond sense, the inapprehensible] Zero summer? 4 This is again an example of the deletion of material to achieve concentration. But, you may ask then, where are the problems, if the publication in book form would seem to represent the author's final text? Publication in book form and subsequent appearances in other editions by no means excludes textual problems and may multiply them. To complicate matters a little further there are the possibilities of further changes between re-impressions of the same edition. As far as can be judged upon the basis of various impressions of Eliot's works, the printers print from type and not plates. This means that we must restrict ourselves to the first impression of any given edition and that each re-impression may show variations. There are cases of dropped letters, attrition of punctuation, and even of meaningless correction in later printings of the Collected Poems 1909-1935 and the plays. 5 If current sheets were used for the printer's copy for a new edition, these faulty exemplars could lead to further discrepancies. On the other hand this practice also gives room for authoritative alterations in the texts between various re-impressions of the same edition. There are two striking examples of such variation in the poems. At approximately the third impression of Four Quartets we find the alteration of 'hermit crab' to 'horseshoe crab' in "The Dry Salvages". 6 In the Collected Poems at about the fifth impression there is the change of the line 'And reconciles forgotten wars.' in "Burnt Norton" to 'Appeasing long forgotten wars.' to harmonize the text with that printed in the Faber Four Quartets . Neither of these changes is to be found in the American editions. Since we have a lot of ground to cover, I would like to take two examples, "Portrait of A Lady" and "Whispers of Immortality", to show in detail the fluctuations between the various editions down through the Collected Poems 1909-1935 . The most trivial variants are included so that we may see the maximum range of fluctuation. From other poems examples of variants will be given in less detail. "Portrait of A Lady" appeared as follows: P 1 . Others , I, 3 (Sept., 1915), 35-40. A 1 . Catholic Anthology (1915), 9-15. A 2 . Others An Anthology (1916), 33-38. B 1 . Prufrock (1917), 17-23. B 2 .

It is somewhat more difficult to tell whether the great number of variants in A 1 are the result of Pound's editing the text for publication in his anthology or are changes later rejected again by the author. The greatest fluctuation has been in strophe divisions and this is a problem with many of the poems. Whether the change in wording by the deletion of 'quite' in line 118 is important or not can only be determined by the emotional weight attached by a reader to the implied difference in time. The next example "Whispers of Immortality," is of some interest, for Empson uses it as an example of an ambiguity of the second type, basing his interpretation in part upon only one of the three punctuations for the lines he discusses. 7 This poem appeared as follows: P 1 . Little Review , V,5 (September, 1918), 11-12 B 1 . Poems (Hogarth Press, 1919). B 2 . Ara Vos Prec (1920), 21. B 3 . Poems (Knopf, 1920), 31-32. B 4 . Poems 1909-1925 (Faber, 1925), 57-58. B 5 . Poems 1909-1925 (Faber Library, 1932), 72-74. B 6 . Collected Poems 1909-1935 (Faber 1936), 53-54. There are no variations in the form of the poem, because of the regular strophes. Instead we have fluctuations in punctuation and changes in phrasing: 3. underground B 1 ∥ under ground P 1 , B 2+ 10. for sense&amp;c.rat; P 1 , B 1,2 ∥ for sense; B 3,4,5 ∥ for sense, B 6 11. and penetrate, P 1 , B 1,2,3,4,5 ∥ and penetrate; B 6 12. beyond experience&amp;c.rat; P 1 , B 1,2 ∥ beyond experience, B 3+ 17.

And even abstracter entities P 1 , B 1,2 ∥ And even the Abstract Entities B 3+ 32. To keep its metaphysics warm P 1 , B 1,2 ∥ To keep our B 3+ It is clear that the poem was completely revised for the Knopf edition in 1920, but that the revision only complicated the problem of punctuation for lines 10-12. Empson discusses the poem in terms of two possibilities of syntax and says that the less obvious grammar is insisted upon by the punctuation. However, he bases his analysis upon the punctuation of B 3-5 which was altered in 1936 in B 6 . The natural voice phrasing of the lines would require the pause after 'penetrates' and the punctuation of the first appearance or the last appearance would be feasible, but not the intervening stage. The problem of punctuation, whether here or in the works of other authors, constitutes a major difficulty in analyzing texts, for a punctuation sign can affect the interpretation considerably. In the case of Eliot's works the presence or absence of punctuation varies as the mode of writing varies, so that we cannot deduce any over-all rule which could be a guide for us in studying his works. Of all the poems preceding "The Waste Land" there are exactly two which show no changes of any sort in their texts, but even so the epigraph of one of these poems was altered slightly. We find a number of variants in the other poems, ranging from what seems to be editorial alteration to the purely typographical problem of French accents. "He laughed like an irresponsible foetus" did not appear in "Mr. Apollinax" when it was first printed in Poetry . From some of Pound's letters criticizing the editor of Poetry it seems quite possible that here we have a case of editorial deletion. "Conversation Galante", the earliest of the poems in Eliot's various collections, provides an example of how an error in wording can creep into a poem and persist. "With your air indifferent and imperious" read from 1920 until 1936 "With your aid. . ." and in the context the error still made some kind of sense. Quite an interesting case of variants is provided by "Rhapsody on a Windy Night" where we find slightly changes in phrasing in each appearance through Poems 1909-1925 . The first change, between Blast and Prufrock , is clearly from the author: "Dissolve the floors of [the] memory" where the second 'the' is deleted. In Ara Vos Prec the "hand of a child" becomes the "hand of the child". The third change comes in Poems 1909-1925 . Originally the moon twisted a paper rose, "That smells of dust and old cologne" and then the line ended with a period. In the next stage we find 'old Cologne' and the line ends with a comma, and finally it becomes "dust and eau de Cologne", still ending with a comma. This last change can hardly be attributed to a printer, but it was pointed out to me by a friend in the printing business that the change could have come from oral proofreading rather than from the author. 8 Reflection upon this and other variants leads me to the feeling that bibliographical studies of modern authors might require some investigation of who read proof and how it was read. In "Dans Le Restaurant" we find examples of almost every type of variant, but there is one particular example to which I would like to draw attention. In the line beginning, "Elle était toute mouillée, . . ." we find that the first two words were originally printed correctly with the accent only on 'était' and then later we find them printed without any accents. From 1925 to date there are accents on both words: "Ellé était". Such points as these may be useful in tracing the relationships between editions and the way sheets are used for the preparation of succeeding editions. In Poems 1909-1925 we also have, in a later line, another mistake: "vautur". When the volume was reset in 1932 we find that this error had been corrected, although the point referred to above remained unchanged. From this and other places we can see that corrections or alterations are made generally only at those points to which attention has been called and that otherwise a mistake may persist through several editions. "Gerontion" has been treated fully, although without reference to fluctuations in strophe division, by William Marshall in Studies in Bibliography and his investigation of this poem shows the same general pattern of fluctuations as all the other poems. 9 However, in the light of his article, we are faced with an almost insoluble problem. Eliot, in examining a composite text of "Gerontion," checked in two places the punctuation of the first appearance in Ara Vos Prec as being correct. The particular punctuations he designated in these two lines as being correct have never appeared again in any later printing of the poem. This would mean then that any other poem is potentially correct at some point only in the reading of the first printing. It is clear that this situation is not always true, but there are enough places where the punctuation of the first appearance makes good sense and could be correct so that we cannot be sure which variant actually reflects the author's intention. We should say something also about the relationship between the earlier editions and some problems which we find there. Prufrock consists of three gatherings, A 4 B-C 8 , and appears to be fairly carefully printed. The author seems to have gone through the texts of the poems for this edition when we compare them with the magazine appearances. There are some fluctuations in the physical size of the book which are of no significance as far as can be told. Poems 1919 is printed in one gathering of eights and reprints the poems, on the whole, from the texts of their periodical appearances. In "Lune de Miel" there are two changes partway through the printing: 'capitaux' to 'chapitaux' and 'aestivale' to 'estivale'. In the bibliography of Eliot by Donald Gallup these two states are differentiated by the label, the copies with the error bearing white labels printed in red and corrected copies white labels printed in black. 10 I have seen, however, one copy with the error and a label imprinted in black, so that the relation of the text variants to the binding operation, as marked by the different labels, is not exact. We should, therefore, distinguish the states of the text without concern for the labels. This is one of the books where a large number of copies should be collated. Ara Vos Prec is another volume where a large number of copies should be collated. It is printed in gatherings of fours: i 2 [A] 4 B 4 [C]-[D] 4 E-G 4 [H] 2 . Pagination is lacking on a number of pages in an irregular sequence; the position of two poems is falsely indicated in the table of "Contents"; and there are other typographical details which indicate that there was something unusual in the printing of this book. It is an elaborate and, let us be honest, rather tasteless and badly printed volume. It shows poor impressions of the forms on a number of pages accompanied by instances of broken, blurred, and partly inked type. Here is the perfect example of the difficulty of using photographic reproductions to determine something of the make-up and text of a book. At several points in my copy there are either letters in a word or punctuation marks which are visible by close inspection but only because of the strong uninked impression made into the paper. Most of the variants appear to be errors and one's first impression is that the book should be discarded from consideration. But it is the first appearance in book form of six poems, and we have already noted in "Gerontion" there may be points in the six new poems where the text is substantive. The first commercial appearance and the first American appearance in book form of Eliot's poems, other than "Portrait of A Lady," came in 1920 with the publication of Poems by Knopf. Donald Gallup, in his bibliography, treats this edition as simply the American edition of Ara Vos Prec , commenting that "the contents are identical with those of Ara Vos Prec , with the exception that 'Hysteria' is substituted for 'Ode' and 'Le Spectateur' is printed as 'Le Directeur'". In addition the spelling of 'Apollinax' is corrected. As we have seen in "Whispers of Immortality," Eliot revised the texts of a number of poems for this edition. It would appear that the texts of the poems from Prufrock were simply reprinted, while the poems from Poems 1919 and Ara Vos Prec were gone through again for this volume. There are changes in the following poems which remain constant throughout later printings: "Dans Le Restaurant, The Hippopotamus, Sweeney Erect, Sweeney Among The Nightingales, Whispers of Immortality, Gerontion." It also contains in "Sweeney Among The Nightingales" one unique reading where the last line reads "And let their liquid droppings fall". In "A Cooking Egg" there is also a footnote which does not reappear again: "i.e., an endemic tea shop, found in all parts of London. The Initials signify: Aereated Bread Company, Limited." It does not seem that this volume can be treated simply as the American edition of Ara Vos Prec , but instead should be awarded independent status. The Waste Land still remains a centre of interest and offers us the possibility of enlarging our discussion in the light of the letters of Pound and Pound's statement in We Moderns about the notes. The poem appeared first in The Criterion in October, 1922, without notes and with no reference to notes. It next appeared in The Dial for November, 1922, with some alterations and a footnote stating that the poem was to appear shortly with annotations by Eliot. In December, 1922, it first appeared as a book, again with one or two variants, and now for the first time with the notes. The Hogarth Press edition first appeared in September, 1923. Variations between the periodical and book appearances are to be found partly in typographical details, such as the presence or absence of italics, and partly in strophe divisions, changes in punctuation, and in The Criterion version the use of quotation marks and differences in wording from later versions. Two of these Criterion variants are of interest. In line 80 we find "Wherefrom a golden Cupidon peeped out", later changed to "From which a golden Cupidon peeped out". The phrasing of this variant is the same as in Eliot's letter to Pound in The Letters of Ezra Pound and is some slight evidence that this first printing is closer to the original draft wherever there are variants. In line 426 we find the phrasing was originally "Shall I at least see my lands in order" which is replaced by the more active "Shall I at least set my lands in order". Even assuming that the first printing represented a typographical error, it is persuasive, particularly when we think of the emphasis on eyes and sight in this and other poems. The Dial shows minor differences again from both The Criterion and the Boni and Liveright editions. Apart from variants in punctuation and strophe breaks we find that, in this printing only, line 335 reads "If there were only water amongst the rock" instead of the line in all other printings, "if there were water we should stop and drink". Since this is properly line 338 either the compositor anticipated the line and printed it in the wrong place and repeated it again in its proper position or we have a true variant which was dropped again because of the repetition. When we compare the punctuation, we find that, on the whole, there are deletions rather than alterations or additions. Strophe fluctuations still occur as late as the Collected Poems 1909-1935 . The Boni and Liveright edition is of interest not only because it was the first appearance of the poem in book form but also because of the notes. Pound wrote in 1940: The bearing of this poem was not over-estimated, nevertheless the immediate reception of it by even second-rate reviewers was due to the purely fortuitous publication of the notes, and not to the text itself. Liveright wanted a longer volume and the notes were the only available unpublished material. 11 The book consists of four unsigned gatherings, [A-D] 8 , with the text beginning only on the fifth leaf of the first gathering, preceded by a blank leaf, a half-title, title-page, and a second half-title. The spacing between strophes, as well as of the titles of the sections, varies considerably, the whole book giving the appearance of very loose composition. We might cite as examples of haste or carelessness the dropped 'a' in Part II in the line, "The hot w[a]ter at ten" and the dropping out of the 'a' in 'mountain' (Part V) partway through the run. 11a Both of these should have been noticed by the pressman in a printing of this size. The text runs exactly ten type lines—seven lines of verse—over the end of gathering C. So D1 r has text with blank verso, D2 r is the half-title for the notes and the notes begin on D3 r and run through D8 v , facing the endpapers. I am told that this is considered bad printing practice and might be just a slight indication that most of the book was set when the notes arrived and that they ran a little longer than was expected. To give the other side of the picture, as I should, the text could have been squeezed somewhat, so as to end on C8 v but with the probability that there would have been unfortunate page breaks. Typographically, then, we must render the old Scotch verdict of "Not Proven" on Pound's statement, but note that the bulking is extremely obvious. The Hogarth Press edition in unsigned gatherings of fours, [A-F] 4 , is based upon The Criterion printing with the notes added, these apparently being reprinted directly from the Boni and Liveright edition. In some copies Eliot corrected three places by hand—two typographical mistakes in the text and the name of the publisher of Weston's book. One copy I have seen shows that an author's handwritten corrections can also create new variants! In every edition but the Hogarth printing line 96 reads "In which sad light a carvèd dolphin swan". In the Hogarth printing the dolphin was 'coloured' which was corrected by the author in this one copy to 'carven'. One place where we have a persuasive variant comes in Part II. There the nightingale "Filled all the desert with inviolable voice, / And still she cries (and still the world pursues)". The comma at the end of the line is also missing. The use of 'cries' instead of 'cried' is possibly a printing mistake, yet one which would easily be passed over, because it makes sense in the context. I would assume that this edition, however, is not substantive and that it was unlikely that the author read proof on it. When we read the letters of Pound and Eliot's letter to Pound and think of the use of the Phlebas lines from "Dans Le Restaurant," the epigraph—later deleted—to "Sweeney Among the Nightingales," together with the references to Agamemnon and "Gerontion," we can see that the material of the poem is scarcely a by-product of reading From Ritual to Romance . Rather this book served at best as a catalyst to bring together a large number of reminiscences and ideas, ranging from the Psalms to Conrad, from the Prophets to Joyce. Six lines of a poem which Eliot has dated as having been written in 1912 are similar to lines in Part I of "The Waste Land," and this, to me, points up that the act of composition was partly the reworking and recombining of material already written with those lines composed in 1921. From these letters and other clues we can associate the minor poems, "Eyes that last I saw in tears", "The Wind sprang up at four o'clock", "Song to the Opherian", and most of "The Hollow Men" as being part of the same compositional activity as "The Waste Land." It is uncertain whether "Gerontion," even though already published, also formed part of the original manuscript. We do see, however, from the letters that Pound's role in the final shaping of the poem was not simply that of an axe-wielder, but rather, as Eliot himself once expressed it, that "he tried first to understand what one was trying to do, and then tried to help one do it in one's own way." With this we are at the Faber Poems 1909-1925 , issued both as a trade and as a limited, signed edition. Although printed from the same type, the trade edition collates i 6 A2 4 B-E 8 F 6 G 4 while the limited edition runs [A] 4 B-N 4 , so that technically they are different impressions with possibilities for variants, since the forms would have been unlocked and different signatures inserted. This is a somewhat different case from most of the later limited, signed editions which are merely the same impressions as the trade edition on a different quality paper. But none of these cases really form a new edition. There is one further stage of this edition which should be listed in a bibliography: that in 1932 it was completely reset for inclusion in the Faber Library. Of this impression sheets were run off for Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co. with a separate half-title and title-leaf, these being bound in America. When we consider together with this circumstance that both Murder in the Cathedral and The Rock in their American printing were photo-offsets, we have a strong presumption that none of the Harcourt editions is in any way substantive. 12 Even the deletion of one line from The Rock does not change its status in any way, since the negative was simply cut and spliced, and the change is found in the later English impressions. As we have seen, there are changes in the text of this edition. Only one poem appears for the first time, but it is an interesting example of the struggle to reach the fitting form: " The Hollow Men ." Part III first appeared as one of "Doris's Dream Songs" in the Chapbook , and Part I as "Poème" in Commerce , also in 1924. In January, 1925, Parts II and IV were printed as the first and third poems respectively of "Three Poems" in The Criterion , "Eyes that last I saw in tears" being the second poem. Under the title "The Hollow Men, I-III" Parts I, II, and IV appeared in The Dial for March, 1925. In addition to the rearrangement of the parts and the inclusion of Part V, the differences between the various periodical appearances of the poem and the final published form are the deletion of one line and the elimination of one strophe division. The difficulty in arriving at a final form can be explained easily, if we accept the thought advanced earlier that parts of this poem actually were fragments deleted from, or written in conjunction with "The Waste Land" and that it was only after much thought that Eliot was able to fuse them with lines written later. Seen in the framework of the total poetic production, it also suggests that the exploration of the possibilities of a form comes first and that then this brings with it later the realization that the various parts of this exploration form a sequence in themselves. Of the later poems we shall say less here, although we find variants. Sweeney Agonistes shows changes in punctuation and orthography, as well as as the deletion of one line, compared with its early appearance in book form. One of the most interesting poems prior to 1935 is Ash Wednesday . Again we have periodical publication of three parts of the poem under separate titles: II in December, 1927, I in the spring of 1928, and III in the autumn of 1929. Between the periodical versions and the final form we find deletions of lines, reversal of one pair of lines, minor changes in phrasing and strophe divisions. The poem was first planned in a large format, of which proofs exist in two forms: one set for I, 1-23 and another set for the whole poem. These differ primarily in punctuation. When Ash Wednesday appeared as part of the Collected Poems 1909-1935 , there crept into the text in Part V a mistake which is a classic example of the persistence of error: And the light shone in darkness and Against the Wor[l]d the unstilled world whirled About the centre of the silent Word. The 'l' which found its way into 'Word' has persisted through every subsequent printing of the Collected Poems , every selection from it, including the new Selected Poems of last year, is in every foreign translation, and I remember seeing these lines used once somewhere as an example of the difficulty of interpreting Eliot's poetry. (The Harcourt edition did not have this, but in their recent paper-back edition, have finally also succumbed to the error.) The Ariel poems which parallel Ash Wednesday show no variants, except for the much later "Triumphal March". Each edition brings with itself new variants and the Collected Poems 1909-1935 is no exception, whether the changes be in punctuation or in the addition of three lines to a poem previously published in a periodical. Yet I would like to turn now to the plays, for they show even more striking variants, in some cases, than the poems. We would expect to find alterations in the text of a play, if we possessed a complete sequence of texts from the first draft through the final published texts. There would be modifications by the author and changes based upon rehearsal, conditions of performance, and suggestions by the director. But we are, in the main, accustomed to regard the published text as a precipitate of all these factors, representing the author's considered final text. After publication he is no longer responsible for changes which may be made by any director in a later performance of the play. This is not always true of Eliot's work for the stage. Including the fragments of Sweeney Agonistes , there are six publications by Eliot in dramatic form. Two of these we will not consider here, for Eliot had taken them, either in full or in part, into the Collected Poems 1909-1935 . This leaves four plays: Murder in the Cathedral , The Family Reunion , The Cocktail Party , and The Confidential Clerk . Of these four, two show no changes between the first and later printings other than possible corruptions in the printing process: The Family Reunion and The Confidential Clerk . This may be the result of their infrequent performances as compared to the other two plays. The Confidential Clerk , however, does show an interesting variant between the English and American editions which apparently reflects an editorial change for overseas consumption. In the first act of the Faber edition Sir Claude says to Eggerson: Well, we'll leave that for the present. As we have a little time Before you start for Northolt—the car will be ready— Let's think what you're to say to Lady Elizabeth, Coming back from the airport, about Colby. (10:1-4) but in the American edition he says: Well, we'll leave that for the present. As we have a little time Before you start for the airport—the car will be ready— Let's think what you're to say to Lady Elizabeth, Coming back from Northolt, about Colby. (12:13-16) It is possible that the other twenty-odd minor variants, apart from stage directions, between the American and British editions are either editorial or purely fortuitous. As far as can be told, the author did not read proof on the play and there seem to be some loose ends in the final published text. There is also a misprint in Act II, where Kaghan remarks: I'm your guardian angel, Colby, to protect your from Lucasta. (61:15-16) I have not yet been able to establish whether this was corrected during the first printing, thus creating a 'point' for bookdealers and collectors, or whether it remained constant. The Cocktail Party presents an interesting bibliographical problem entirely apart from the later revisions to the text. Copies of the Faber first printing contain, on page 29, the response of the Unidentified Guest (Sir Henry Harcourt-Reilly) to Edward's statement that he wants to see Lavinia again: You shall see here again—here. The first 'here' was corrected to 'her' partway through the printing—it is fair to estimate after more than a thousand copies had been printed. 13 The problem arises, because it has been stated that the error was not in the first copies, but crept in later, since it was not in the copy presented to Eliot as the "first copy off the press". It is far more likely, however, that this copy would have been one of the last off the press, even if first bound. The preceding line, spoken by Edward, seems far more significant in this connection: I want to see her again—here. It sems quite logical to assume that the last word of this line was carried over accidentally in composition and was then later corrected, since such a correction would be relatively simple in monotype. We would otherwise have to postulate that the extra letter was added partway through the printing as a byproduct of another correction or alteration of which no traces remain! Again we find differences in punctuation and in minor details (stage directions) between the Faber first printing of May, 1950, and the first Harcourt printing. These, we may assume, are the result of unauthoritative editorial changes. The major alterations in the text come in the fourth Faber printing of September, 1950, where we find minor changes in the first two acts and considerable revision in the third act. These changes were later adopted in the Harcourt text, but the date is uncertain and the author's note on the revisions is omitted, so that there are no outward indications of any alterations. They are all motivated by the need to clarify some of the time relationships in the play and by a change in some of the stage business. In the first two acts the changes are fairly straightforward: one correction of punctuation, two places where lines are added, and a few changes in wording. At the end of the first scene of Act I in the first printing the fact that Edward does not reach Celia on the phone is given in the stage direction. In the revision two lines are added to clarify this: Is Miss Celia Coplestone in? . . . How long ago? . . . No, it doesn't matter. (44:18-19) This also forms a bridge to the second scene of Act I where Celia enters. Here, also, there is one change in phrasing to correct the time sequence. For the "And I tried to get you a moment ago." (45:4) of the first printing we now have "And I tried to get you a short while ago." (45:4) This is more in agreement with the partly finished game of Patience Edward is playing than the phrasing of the first printing. In the discussion between Celia and Edward there is a particularly striking example of alteration in phrasing. In the original printing Celia said: I shall not loathe you. I shall only feel sorry for you. It's only myself I am in danger of hating. (57:23-24) In the revision she now says: I shall not loathe you. I shall only feel sorry for you. It's only myself I am in danger of loathing. (57:23-24) This change involves the repetition of a word, running counter to the tendency in the bulk of Eliot's work. One of the principles governing alterations seems to be the desire to avoid the same or similar wording within the same work. Here we have a direct repetition. Shortly after this speech we find, also in a speech by Celia, an additional line in the revised version: "Edward, I see that I was simply making use of you." (59:14). Again, this seems to be the result of a need for further clarification of the situation. In Act II there are two changes. None of the variants in the first two acts represent any major alteration, but all seem to be improvements and final polishing of the text, requiring no extensive changes in the setting of the type. We have a considerable amount of revision, however, in the third act, necessitated, in part, by keeping Peter Quilpe on stage for a longer period of time. This involved some changing in phrasing and some carpentry work—the shifting of speeches from one position to another with enough alteration so that the joints do not show. There are, however, other deletions and alterations less directly concerned with changed stage business. The simplest alteration, and the one not followed by Harcourt, Brace, was the elimination of the vulgarism from Peter's line: "Yeah, from New York." (147:12) As a sample of the combination of lines, let us take two speeches by Julia from the first printing: Why can't you take me? It's very much cheaper. (152:20) Well, why can't you reconstruct me ? Oh, dear, I can see you're determined not to have me: (153:2-3) In the revised printing these are fused: Very well, then: Why not reconstruct me ? It's very much cheaper. Oh, dear, I can see you're determined not to have me: (153:3-5) To give an example of the transposing and altering of lines, let us take the point of Peter Quilpe's exit in the first version. Julia says there: And now I'm going to change the subject. Celia chose a road that led her to Kinkanja; You have chosen one that leads you to Boltwell— And you've got to go there. (159:13-16) Peter then takes his leave, and the others turn to a discussion of the meaning of Celia's death and their relationship to it. Julia says then: Everyone makes a choice, of one kind or another, And then must take the consequences. Celia chose A way of which the consequence was crucifixion; Peter Quilpe chose a way that takes him to Boltwell; And now the consequence of the Chamberlaynes' choice Is a cocktail party. They must be ready for it. Their guests may be arriving at any moment. (165:13-19) In the revised version the first speech of Julia's quoted above is deleted. Peter remains through the discussion between Reilly and the others. Julia then says: Everyone makes a choice, of one kind or another, And then must take the consequences. Celia chose A way of which the consequence was Kinkanja. Peter chose a way that leads him to Boltwell: And he's got to go there . . . (163:14-18) Peter now leaves on the note of "what else can I do?", and takes his farewells. At his departure Julia continues—some nineteen lines later: . . . And now the consequence of the Chamberlaynes' choice Is a cocktail party. They must be ready for it. Their guests may be arriving at any moment. (164:15-17) In the first printing Alex leaves the room at this point and returns with champagne for the toast to "Lavinia's Aunt". The toast is deleted in the fourth printing. It is difficult to tell how much actual resetting these changes involved, and whether they are sufficient to call this fourth printing a new edition. It would be feasible, however, to refer to it as a separate edition. 14 As far as can be judged, the nature and extent of the revisions would indicate that Eliot had gone through the text completely for this printing and that it must, therefore, be considered the substantive edition of the play. Murder in the Cathedral is not only the best-known and most produced play by Eliot but it also has the most complicated textual history. The relationship between the various editions has not yet, as far as I can tell, been adequately described, and deserves consideration in some detail. The sequence of the editions is: B 1 . Acting edition for the Festival of the Friends of Canterbury Cathedral. (May 10, 1935). B 2 . First trade edition: Faber &amp; Faber, Ltd., (June, 1935) B 3 . Second trade edition: Faber &amp; Faber, Ltd., (January, 1936) B 4 . Third trade edition: Faber &amp; Faber, Ltd., (August, 1937) B 5 . Fourth (School) edition: Faber &amp; Faber, Ltd., (September, 1938). The American editions can be left out of consideration, for the first American edition was a photo-offset of B 2 and the second American edition was set from B 3 and shows no variation from it. The other editions have never been reprinted in the United States. Whether this reflects an editorial choice on the part of Eliot and his publishers, or is the result of other considerations cannot at present be determined. Donald Gallup refers to the text of B 1 in his bibliography as being "slightly altered and abbreviated for the production and is so printed in this edition." Whether this description is entirely appropriate is not so certain, in my opinion, when we compare the texts of B 1 and B 2 . Apart from the differences in the prose passages, B 1 is shorter by about 250 lines of verse—a severe abbreviation in comparison to the overall length of the play as printed in B 2 . When we compare the prose parts of the plays, we find a considerable expansion in B 2 as well as alterations. Some of the passages which do not appear in B 1 but only in B 2 (and later editions), such as the alternation of Priests, Tempters, and Chorus ("Is it the owl that calls, or a signal between the trees?") have been singled out as being particularly impressive. There are lines and phrases, on the other hand, which appear in B 1 and are deleted in B 2 . The differences between B 2 and B 1 are mainly in punctuation, phrasing, and deletions or additions. In general there are more punctuation signs in B 1 and much of the pointing which remains in B 2 has been altered. No! Shall I, who keep the keys Of heaven and hell, supreme, alone in England, (B 1 , 11:1-2) No! shall I, who keep the keys Of heaven and hell, supreme alone in England, (B 2 , 30:1-2) We are the backbone of the nation; We, not the plotting parasites About the King. Excuse my bluntness. I am a rough, straightforward Englishman. (B 1 , 11:34-37) We are the backbone of the nation. We, not the plotting parasites About the King. Excuse my bluntness: I am a rough straightforward Englishman. (B 2 , 31:13-16) Very few of the punctuation marks present in B 1 and deleted or altered in B 2 seem to be necessary or important in the voicing or interpretation of the text. The revision, evident in punctuation, between B 1 and B 2 parallels the alterations which we find between earlier drafts of Eliot's poetry and the later published form. On the basis of the punctuation it would seem that B 1 was revised for B 2 . Changes in phrasing within the lines are not numerous but again suggest the patterns traced at the beginning of this essay of minor shifts in phrasing prior to final publication in book form. Examples can be found in the Choruses: Rings of light coiling downwards, descending To the horror of the ape. (B 1 , 28:7-8) Rings of light coiling downwards, leading To the horror of the ape. (B 2 , 66:2-3) We have all had our private terrors, Our individual shadows, our secret fears. (B 1 , 6:2-3) We have all had our private terrors, Our particular shadows, our secret fears. (B 2 , 19:21-22) I have seen Trunk and hoof, tusk and horn, in odd places; (B 1 , 28:1-2) I have seen Trunk and horn, tusk and hoof, in odd places; (B 2 , 65:8-9) On the whole these would represent the normal process of a final revision, as would a certain number of minor additions to the text of B 2 , compared to B 1 , in lines where the text is otherwise identical. There are two other groups of revisions between B 1 and B 2 : rewriting or redistributing passages and the deletions of parts of lines as contrasted to the additions we otherwise find: We have sometimes been afflicted with taxes, (B 1 , 5:37) We have been afflicted with taxes, (B 2 , 19:17) All things must prepare the event. I will show you. Watch. (B 1 , 8:9-10) All things prepare the event. Watch. (B 2 , 23:8) In one of the Choruses in B 1 we find two lines, repetitious in their context, which do not appear in B 2 . Rewriting is to be found mainly in the Interlude and in the prose speeches of the Knights, which are also assigned differently in B 1 from the first trade edition. Both the speeches where the Priests beg Thomas to come to Vespers and the speeches of the Priests after the Knights finally leave the stage show a different distribution of the lines in B 1 . At the latter point the speeches of the First and Third Priest appear in not only an abbreviated form in comparison to B 2 but also in the following order: Third Priest O father, father, gone from us, lost to us, How shall we find you, from what far place Do you look down on us? You now in Heaven! Second Priest Go, weak, sad men, lost erring souls, homeless in earth or heaven. In the small circle of pain within the skull You still shall tramp and tread one endless round Of thought, to justify your action to yourselves, Weaving a fiction which unravels as you weave, Pacing forever in the hell of make-believe Which never is belief: this is your fate on earth. First Priest Who shall now guide us, protect us, direct us? The Church lies bereft, Alone, desecrated, desolated, and the heathen shall build on the ruins Their world without God. I see it. I see it. Second Priest No. For the Church is stronger for this action, Triumphant in adversity. It is fortified By persecution: supreme, so long as men will die for it. O my Lord! The glory of whose new state is hidden from us, (B 1 , 36:12-30) 15 It seems quite clear that we must find another formulation for the relationship between the Acting edition and the first trade edition, for it does not seem to be as simple as one might assume from Gallup's description. Let us accept B 1 as an abbreviated form of a longer version. However, can we disregard the pattern of variations between B 1 and B 2 ? Turning now to the following lines: Power possessed grows to glory, A life lasting, a permanent possession, (B 1 , 9:33-34) Power obtained grows to glory, Life lasting, a permanent possession, (B 2 , 26:19-20) we find that in the fragments of the holograph draft of the play these two lines (giving both the original and manuscript correction) are: Power possessed grows to glory 1: Lasting a life 2: A life lasting a permanent possession 16 In these holograph pages there are two or three other places with agreement in phrasing with B 1 , where the phrasing differs from B 2 . It would seem therefore that B 1 represents an abridgement of a script which was subsequently revised to form the text of B 2 , so that B 1 and B 2 are parallel texts from different stages of the development of the play. It is a far simpler matter to compare the text of B 3 with B 2 , for the alterations are easily apparent and very small, except for the substitution of the Chorus for the Introits at the beginning of Part II. We find the correction of two typographical mistakes and alteration of the punctuation in six places in Part II, three of those being in the final Chorus. Eliot states that the text "is now in conformity with the recent production at the Mercury Theatre, London." This note, dated January 1936, would suggest that the Chorus had been written in the intervening period between May 1935 and late 1935 and was printed as a result of the specific performance mentioned, thus being determined, in part, by theatrical considerations. This change, highly praised by many critics, remains the only change known to those who have read American editions of the play or seen performances here, for no subsequent version has been published in the United States. The changes in this version do not seem large enough to classify it as a "second edition", for it appears to have been printed from the same setting as B 2 on the basis of certain typographical peculiarities in the two printings. It would be better described as a reprinting of B 2 with corrections. 17 With B 4 the situation becomes somewhat more complicated. The entire First Part and the Interlude remain identical with B 3 . The identity between the two continues into Part II until shortly after Thomas's first entrance. Then there is some reassignment of the speeches of the Four Knights. Finally the Introits are printed as an Appendix in a text identical, except for a typographical mistake, with their text in B 2 . Eliot writes in a prefatory note that "they may be used instead of the Chorus in productions of the play." This note is dated June 1937. It seems to indicate that the author's attitude towards this portion of the play was by no means fixed. The speeches of the Four Knights have been changed by the reassignment of a number of lines spoken by the Fourth Knight to the other Knights. Since B 3 is the version most familiar to most readers, let us take it as the basis for giving the pagination and redistribution of the speeches in Part II: B 3 B 4 58: 2 Fourth Knight 58: 2 Third Knight 60: 11-16 Fourth Knight 60: 11-12 First Knight 13 Second Knight 14-16 Third Knight 61: 10 Fourth Knight 61: 10 First Knight 63: 2 Fourth Knight . . . deleted 73: 7-10 Knights 73: 7 First Knight 8 Second Knight 9 Third Knight 10 First Knight 76: Second Knight 76: Third Knight 77: Third Knight 77: Second Knight When we examine these changes we notice that these figures are pawns, not originally conceived of as definite characters, even though some critics have tried to do so. There is in addition an attempt to divide some of the speeches in an antiphonal pattern, extending the Senecan pattern already in the play. Eliot writes in the prefatory note to this printing that "at the suggestion of Mr. E. Martin Browne, I have in Part II reassigned most of the lines formerly attributed to the Fourth Knight. When, as originally intended, the parts of the Tempters are doubled with those of the Knights, the advantage of these alterations should be obvious." Before discussing the problem raised by this statement, let us go on to B 5 , the printing of September 1938, for the further alterations we find here bring the problem into sharper focus. In the prefatory note to B 5 Eliot writes: "In this fourth edition certain further rearrangements and deletions have been made, which have been found advisable by experiment in the course of production." On the other hand, this edition was advertised as a "School Edition" and is so described in Gallup's bibliography. It also happens to be the only available edition of the play in England. Certain of the changes, examined without reference to the prefatory note, would certainly be consistent with a simplification for school usage. On looking at the text the first change which one notices is that the Introits of B 1,2 and the Appendix to B 4 are now printed as part of the main text following the opening Chorus of Part II. These are further changed in that certain lines are italicized and those are to be sung. In addition to the redistribution in B 4 which are kept in B 5 (although the deleted line is now restored but reassigned), we find further reassignments of speeches, deletions, and re-phrasing of speeches. The deletions total nearly thirty lines of verse and prose, some extending over several lines and some being the deletion of only a portion of the line. Again using B 3 as our standard of comparison, deletions come at the following points and are total where no page reference is given to B 5 : B 3 B 5 15: 10 First Priest . . . 27: 7-10 Second Tempter . . . 28: 5 Thomas . . . : 6 Tempter . . . 34: 7-9 Thomas . . . 47: 2-3 Thomas 47: 3 Thomas (partial) 49: 23-26 Thomas . . . : 27 Thomas 49: 24 Thomas (partial) 50: 2-3 Thomas 49: 28 Thomas (partial) 62: 18-21 Thomas . . . 63: 8 Knights 66: 5 First Knight (partial) 66: 17-20 Priests . . . 67: 10-15 Thomas . . . 68: 8 Priests 70: 12 Priests (partial) 70: 4-5 Priests . . . 71: 3 Thomas . . . : 17-20 Thomas . . . 73: 17 Knights 75: 18 Knights (partial) 78: 20-26 Third Knight . . . 78: 30) Third Knight . . . 79: 1-2) 79: 13-14 Third Knight 81: 10 Second Knight (partial) 81: 8-9 Fourth Knight . . . 81: 6 Fourth Knight 83: 4 Fourth Knight (partial) 81: 16-18 Fourth Knight . . . One example of the changes in phrasing was given at the beginning of this essay. All of the prose speeches suffer some alterations as well as several verse passages. There are six further reassignments of the speeches of the Knights, so that now the Fourth Knight has only one independent line and one line as part of the group prior to his speech in justification of the killing of Thomas. In addition the speech of the First Priest at the Messenger's entrance in Part I has been broken up into four speeches and there has been some rearrangement of the speeches of the Priests and Thomas in Part II when they try to persuade him to save himself. The latter portion of the Third Priest's speech after the Knights leave, following their justifications for Thomas's death, has also been divided differently: First Priest O my lord The glory of whose new state is hidden from us, Pray for us of your charity. Second Priest Now in the sight of God Conjoined with all the saints and martyrs gone before you, Remember us. Third Priest Let our thanks ascend To God, who has given us another Saint in Canterbury. (B 5 , 85: 13-20) In B 2,3,4 these lines formed the close of the Third Priest's speech. It seems again that such reassignments might have been made to further increase the antiphonal pattern. The redistribution of these lines reminds one of the version quoted earlier from B 1 , and when we compare B 5 with B 1 we are struck immediately by the agreement between the text of the Interlude in B 1 and the text as revised for B 5 . They differ in only one particular—the substitution of the text of the Revised version of the Bible for the King James text in the verse from Luke. The deletions of B 5 as compared to the omissions of B 1 often come at the same points in both versions although they do not always embrace the same number of lines. The phrasing of one line from a Chorus is changed in B 5 and now agrees only with B 1 : "And the earth presses up against our feet." (B 5 , 40:20). Although the phrasing of the Knights' speeches justifying Thomas's death in B 5 is not identical with that of B 1 , changes in phrasing seem to come at the same points in the speeches, and the order of the speakers is identical with the order in B 1 . It would not seem improbable to assume that Eliot had reread the text of B 1 again at some point before making revisions to B 5 . However, it is worth emphasizing again the description of this as a "school edition" earlier in this essay, for we cannot really know what its determining factor was. If a specific performance, then we must consider that each director has made and does make decisions about deletions, assignments of speeches, and action entirely apart from the printed text of the play (proven again by the Donat recording of the play) and thus no one performance is necessarily valid. If school usage, then we can wonder whether the revisions are also valid for a non-school audience. If the advice of others, then it may be asked what effect this has on the editor's task of establishing the text as the author intended it to be. It seems desirable to raise this problem in the light of the reassignment of the speeches of the Fourth Knight. Eliot suggests that, through this, one has the desirable advantage of doubling the roles of the Four Knights. The question might be raised as to whether this means that there is solely the possibility of the same actors playing both sets of roles or does it mean that their function in the play is meant to be similar, so that the Fourth Tempter occupies the same position as the Fourth Knight in Part II which he occupied in Part I. It seems to me that the elimination of most of the speeches of the Fourth Knight tends, if the functions of the Fourth Tempter and Fourth Knight are similar, to emphasize doubts about Thomas's integrity. The Tempters are, in part, aspects of the struggle within Thomas himself—emphasized in the film version by the disembodied voice of the Fourth Tempter. The Knights, however, are external to this struggle, the voice of outside authority, existing apart from Thomas's inward decisions, although an element which precipitated them. If these two forces acting on Thomas are made to be identical, then the play may be felt by some as losing its tantalizing aspect of leaving the audience with an open decision as to Thomas' salvation. With Murder in the Cathedral we have quite a different set of problems from the other plays, emphasized not only by the text itself, but also by the description of B 5 as a "School Edition" and the existence of a separate American text. We cannot solve all the problems of the texts of Eliot's works, although they do present the reader with a wide range of editorial problems. There is still more to be said, for we have not touched at all on the prose works, but this paper is intended only as a point-de-départ for further thought. It may even seem as if we are returning from a fishing trip more memorable for the guppies caught than for the bass. Yet even with the material we have, there is room for thought and questions. But first, as an aside, we should note that there are many incidental gains through approaching an author's work by studying the development of the texts of his work. There is the added insight into recurrent phrasing and themes in the poems and plays and a stricter sense of their chronology and possible interrelationships. In Eliot's poetry there is also room to discuss under variants the alterations in phrasing which borrowings from other authors have undergone. Again, unless we have the sense of the actual chronology of the works, we cannot discuss influences in their proper perspectives, such as the possible influence of Joyce on The Waste Land through the serialization of Ulysses . Kristian Smidt wrote of Eliot's composition: "Usually what look like stanzas in his poetry simply correspond to the paragraphs of prose in that a space is left when a break in meaning requires it and the breaks in meaning come at irregular intervals." 18 In the light of the fluctuations in these breaks, can we assign any such function to them? What is the function of such breaks? Eliot has said that a word for him is not only its sound but also its shape upon the page. Is this also true for a poem? If so, at what stage of the poem? For some prospective "New Critic" there may be far more significance in one punctuation rather than in another, but it would be difficult to say that any given printing reflects the author's exact intentions. Is any given punctuation, or even the line as phrased by the voice, a sufficient and exclusive interpretation of any part of a poem? It might even be that some authors would regard such questions as immaterial. Changes in phrasing and order show that the act of composition is not fixed and finished at once, but may persist over a long period of time and through various arrangements of the lines. Such changes hint that part of the act of composition is the achievement of concentration in the phrasing and even that there is the attempt to find phrasing coloured by conversational language. I wonder if anyone has pointed out that even the use of quotations from other languages can still be conversational—not the conversation of the pub but of the "high-class" cocktail party? We stand here in the twilight zone between the author who revises his works so thoroughly that they represent two easily differentiated states of existence and the author for whom the first edition would represent the edition most likely to have been proof-read and to conform most closely to his intentions. And in using that word, we must ask what an author's intention may be? When can we say that it is realized in any given modern text? Authors vary in their attentiveness to detail; they revise—but the revisions may come long after the first version of the work. Do they then approach the work with the same intentions? Even within a work an author's apparent intentions may change, as with Joyce. Is the intention underlying a work existent and operative in every detail of the work? Do changes in details or the recasting of parts of a play affect the intention of the play? Is "intention," then, something we derive from the author or from our interpretation of the work? And finally, in the light of all these problems, I should like to raise the ultimate question appropriate to a symposium on modern authors: "At what point does a modern poem or a play—or novel—cease to be in a state of 'becoming' and reach a state of 'being'?"</field>

"Little Gidding" appeared in the same journal in Vol. XXI, 26 (Oct. 15, 1942), 213-217. 5 As an example we might note the line "Not in this or guise, for my present purpose" from one of the later impressions of Murder in the Cathedral , where the 'or' had dropped out and been replaced in the wrong position in the line. Faber &amp; Faber, Ltd. has informed me that type for Eliot's books is set by Monotype which is then kept standing (not recast). 6 Mr. Eliot had called attention, however, to this alteration in the text in a letter to the New English Weekly , XXVI, 15 (January 25, 1945), 112, prior to the change in the printed text. 7 William Empson, Seven Types of Ambiguity (New York: Meridian Books, M11, 1955), 91-92. 8 Mr. Eliot informed me in a personal letter that "it was the author this time".

I owe much to Professor Gallup for making material available to me which was not in my own collection. 11 Quoted from Gallup, p. 7. 11a As with Poems 1919 , so also for The Waste Land the textual variants must alone determine the state, since the flexible binding associated with the first issue can be found also in copies without the 'a' in 'mountain'. 12 This feeling may also be strengthened by the deposit of the Faber edition of Collected Poems 1909-1935 to secure ad interim copyright pending completion of the Harcourt, Brace edition. 13 This is, of course, a guess, but based upon the frequency with which copies containing the error have been seen in relation to other books by Eliot together with several booksellers' estimates of copies sold. 14 Both the first impression and the revised impression collate A-L 8 with paging differing from I6v. 15 The balance of the speech is almost identical with the text of B 2 and so is omitted. The whole passage in B 2 is on pp. 83-84. 16 The manuscript fragments of the first draft of Murder in the Cathedral are in the possession of the Houghton Library of Harvard University. 17 The collation of B 1 is [A-B 8 C 6 ].

      <field name="heading_text">Some Textual Problems in Yeats by Russell K. Alspach *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THIS PAPER IS BASED ON THE VARIORUM EDITION of Yeats's poems that Peter Allt, late professor of Anglo-Irish literature at the University of Groningen, and I have been preparing jointly for some ten years. Because of Peter Allt's untimely death in an accident in London two years ago the finishing of the work fell to me. His death was a severe personal blow, and it was a great loss to Yeats' scholarship. In our work, we confined ourselves to versions of Yeats's poems published by him in magazine or book. We included no manuscript versions—they are quite numerous and widely scattered, and comparatively few are available for study. (And no manuscript version has the final polishing of proofreading by Yeats.) Nor did we include versions of his poems quoted by other writers, e.g. Katharine Tynan 1 and Dorothy Wellesley. 2 At best these are secondhand. As our standard text we used the two-volume limited and signed edition of The Poems of W. B. Yeats published by Macmillan of London in 1949. The publisher's brochure that accompanied this edition reads in part: For some time before his death, W. B. Yeats was engaged in revising the text of this edition of his poems, of which he had corrected the proofs, and for which he had signed the special page to appear at the beginning of Volume I. The outbreak of the Second World War, however, came at a crucial stage in the production of the work, and Messrs. Macmillan &amp; Co. Ltd. had to consider the effect of austere conditions on a publication which had been projected on a lavish scale and which, after the untimely death of this great writer, would have formed a worthy monument of him. It was finally decided that production should be discontinued until after the war, and it is only now, a decade later, that it has become possible to offer the work as it was originally planned. With this definitive edition at hand it is possible to trace the evolution of a Yeats poem from its first published version through all its revisions to its final form and to see how in the process Yeats's concept of what he wanted the poem to say developed. Under revisions I include all changes, even those in punctuation. Perhaps this is dangerous ground; much has been said about Yeats's carelessness in, and lack of knowledge of, punctuation. But the testimony varies. We know, for instance, that he wrote to Robert Bridges in 1915 that 'I chiefly remember that you asked me about stops and commas. Do what you will. I do not understand stops. I write so completely for the ear that I feel helpless when I have to measure pauses by stops and commas.' 3 But Mrs. Yeats told me in the summer of 1954 that she believed shifts in punctuation were very much a problem in any textual study of her husband's work, that W. B. was careful about 'stops and commas,' and that several times he had become quite irate with a publisher who had taken it upon himself to change the poet's punctuation. It took me a long time to convince my colleague on the variorum that punctuation must be noted. His point of view originally, and the point of view of others, was that it should be noted only where the meaning or rhythm is affected. But who is to judge where the meaning or rhythm is affected? Certainly not the textual critic or scholar who is working in the realm of facts and not of aesthetics. And in the case of Yeats the conflicting testimony about his knowledge of punctuation must be kept in mind. I believe further that a close study of the punctuational changes in his verse will convince others, as it has me, that these changes were in the main deliberate and not accidental. That Yeats was an inveterate revisor soon became apparent to discriminating readers of his poetry during the years in which it was being published. He continued to revise until the end; he was never content. He comments often about his revisions. The best-known of these comments is the quatrain he wrote for the second volume of The Collected Works of 1908: The friends that have it I do wrong Whenever I remake a song, Must know what issue is at stake: It is myself that I remake. 4 Not so wellknown, but pertinent to this study, is his statement in the preface written in 1927 for the thirteenth reprinting and revision of Poems (1895): 'This volume contains what is, I hope, the final text of the poems of my youth; and yet it may not be, . . . . One is always cutting out the dead wood.' 5 We can, I think, profitably examine the last words of this statement, 'One is always cutting out the dead wood,' and the implications that arise from it. In any textual study of Yeats's poems no edition, printing, impression, or reissue can be ignored. For example, the volume Later Poems was published in London in 1922 and reprinted there the same year. These printings are identical. In February 1924 it was reprinted again; this time there are a number of changes. In April 1924 it was published in New York, and this printing differed from the London printings of 1922 and February 1924. In 1926 and 1931 there were further reprintings in London: these printings differ from all previous printings and from each other. (A New York reprint of 1928 is identical to the first New York printing, that of 1924.) A second example is the trade edition of The Wild Swans at Coole , published in London and New York in 1919. These are identical. But a London reprint of 1920 has several changes. It is here, for instance, that we have for the first time the final form of 'An Irish Airman Foresees His Death.' A third example is the Selected Poems of 1929, published only in London. (Parenthetically, this is usually ignored by Yeats's textual critics, but textually it is very important. Many of the changes ascribed to Collected Poems (1933) 6 actually appeared first here.) Selected Poems was reprinted in 1930, 1932, 1936, 1938, 1951, and 1952—the last two in the Golden Treasury series. The printings of 1929, 1930, and 1932 are identical; but there are changes for the 1936 printing. From then on the printings are the same. Nor can it be assumed that simultaneous periodical publication in Britain and America meant identity of form. In her admirable study of Yeats's revisions of his later poems, Professor Witt 7 has discussed a case in point: that of 'Among Schoolchildren' published first in both The Dial and The London Mercury for August 1927. Other examples are numerous. 'The Two Kings' appeared in Poetry and The British Review in October 1913. In the 252 lines of these first printings there are over fifty changes, great and small, between the two. In 'Upon a Dying Lady,' in The Little Review , August 1917, and The New Statesman , 11 August 1917, there are some twenty changes in the seventy-three lines. And between the versions of 'The Second Coming' in The Dial , November 1920, and the London Nation , 6 November 1920, there is a startling change. Line 19 reads in The Dial , 'That thirty centuries of stony sleep,' and in The Nation ' 'That twenty centuries of stony sleep.' Even with Yeats's handwriting it's a little difficult to make 'thirty' out of 'twenty.' So far in these examples I have been pointing up the truth of Yeats's assertion about 'always cutting out the dead wood,' and assertion that would have lead one to believe that if he had the latest-dated Yeats volume he had the latest versions of its contents. But there are curious exceptions, exceptions where 'dead wood' persisted beside 'live wood.' One of these is The Wind Among the Reeds , published in London and New York in 1899, and reprinted in both places a number of times. The last printing was London, 1911, called the 'sixth edition.' 8 All printings are identical. But in the meantime The Wind Among the Reeds was revised for the first volume of the 1906 Poetical Works published only in America, 9 and again revised for the first volume of the 1908 Collected Works published only in England. In 1908, therefore, we have in print three versions of the poems in The Wind Among the Reeds : the original version, the version in The Poetical Works I (1906), and the version in The Collected Works I (1908). To add to the mixup, The Poetical Works I (1906) was reprinted nine times, with no changes, to 1922. The same anomaly happens with the 1931 printing of Later Poems that, while it has revisions, does not have all the revisions made for the 1929 Selected Poems . And the 1936 revised printing of Selected Poems does not have all the revisions of the 1933 Collected Poems . An accurate study of the development of a Yeats poem demands, it seems to me, the ability to work one's way through this maze in order to recognize the 'dead wood' and the 'live wood.' Closely allied to the 'dead wood' and 'live wood' textual problem is the problem of the 'early' Yeats and the 'later' Yeats. Any one even faintly familiar with Yeats is aware of this much-discussed division of his work. The difficulty is the wide variance of opinion about where 'early' stops and 'later' begins. One critic dates the 'early' Yeats from 1889 to 1901, another from 1889 to 1910, and another from 1889 to 1914. Perhaps we cannot do better than take the poet's own dates in definition of 'early' and 'later.' He first uses the words 'Early Poems' in 1906 as a subheading in The Poetical Works I. Under 'Early Poems' he includes the long narrative poem 'The Wanderings of Oisin' and certain of the ballads and lyrics from his first two published volumes: The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems (London, 1889) and The Countess Kathleen and Various Legends and Lyrics (London; Boston and London, 1892). He uses the same subheading with almost the same inclusions in 1908 in The Collected Works I. In 1913 in the Tauchnitz edition of A Selection from the Poetry of W.B. Yeats (Leipzig) he modifies the subheading to 'Early Poems (1885-1892)' and includes under it thirteen lyrics from the 1889 and 1892 volumes; later in the same year in A Selection from the Love Poetry of William Butler Yeats (The Cuala Press, Dundrum, Ireland) the subheading is again modified, this time to 'Early Poems 1890-1892': the contents are four lyrics from the 1892 volume. In 1921 in Selected Poems (New York) the heading and the number of poems are the same as in the Tauchnitz edition but with some variation in the selection. In 1925, in the title of the volume Early Poems and Stories (London; New York), he uses the words for the last time; there is a slight shift in the inclusions but they are practically the same as in The Poetical Works I (1906). From here to the definitive edition of 1949 these early poems with the exception of 'The Wanderings of Oisin' are called 'Crossways' and 'The Rose,' descriptive titles Yeats had originally used when he took the shorter poems from the volumes of 1889 and 1892 and published them in Poems (1895). Apparently, then, Yeats thought of his early poetry as that written up to 1892. For he could, in 1906, have included The Wind Among the Reeds (1899) and In the Seven Woods (The Dun Emer Press, Dundrum, Ireland, 1903) among his 'early' poems. And although by 1925 critical opinion was already dividing his work at this date or that date, Yeats stuck to his own division. The term 'later poems' he uses, and by using defines, just once: as the title of the 1922 Later Poems , that includes verse from the following volumes: The Wind Among the Reeds (1899), In the Seven Woods (1903), Poems 1899-1905 (London and Dublin, 1906), The Green Helmet and Other Poems (New York and London, 1912), Responsibilities (London; New York, 1916), The Wild Swans at Coole (London; New York, 1919), and Michael Robartes and the Dancer (Cuala Press, Dundrum, 1921). The line of demarcation seems clear. But having decided the dates of 'early,' the textual critic must next determine just what an early Yeats poem is: i.e., is it an early poem through all its revisions, or is it an early poem through only some of its revisions, or is it an early poem in only its first printing? Of the forty early poems, including 'The Wanderings of Oisin,' in the definitive edition there is not one that was not revised in greater or less degree. Eleven got their final polishing for the definitive edition of 1949, seventeen for Collected Poems (1933), four for Selected Poems (1929), three for the 1927 revision of Poems (1895), two for Early Poems and Stories (1925), one for the 1912 revision of Poems (1895), and two for the first edition of Poems (1895). Thirty-two of the forty were revised finally, then, from 1929 to 1939: the last ten years of Yeats's life. And, as a rule, the later the final polishing the heavier the revisions throughout. The problem becomes more complicated when we study an early poem like 'The Ballad of the Foxhunter,' published first in the magazine East and West for November 1889, then in United Ireland for 28 May 1892, then in The Countess Kathleen , etc. (September, 1892), then in Poems (1895), and so on. In discussing this poem, one critic speaks blithely of 'the early version' and then proceeds to quote the first four stanzas of the version in Poems (1895). But this is the fourth version. He ignores the three earlier versions. Here are lines 5-8 as they appear in each of the versions up to 1895. In the first, that in East and West (November 1889) they read: And of my servants some one go, Bring my brown hunter near, And lead him slowly to and fro, My Lollard old and dear. In the second version ( United Ireland , 28 May 1892) these become And some one from the stable bring My Dermot dear and brown, And lead him gently in a ring, And slowly up and down. The third version ( The Countess Kathleen , etc., September 1892) is identical with the second; the fourth ( Poems , 1895) changes from the third: And some one from the stables bring My Dermot dear and brown, And lead him gently in a ring And gently up and down. It will be noted that in line 5 'stable' has become 'stables' and in line 8 'slowly' has become 'gently.' One wonders by what magic this last version, differing so markedly from the first version and in degree from the second and third versions, becomes 'the early version.' The same difficulty is present in 'The Madness of King Goll' that likewise has several early versions: the first in The Leisure Hour for September 1887, the second in Poems and Ballads of Young Ireland (Dublin, 1888), the third in The Wanderings of Oisin , etc. (1889), and the fourth, and except for minor changes the final version, in Poems (1895). Each of the first three is extensively revised, yet we have a critic saying that 'The Madness of King Goll' was revised so thoroughly that the 1895 version is practically a new poem, the implication of the context being that there was but one earlier version. Another critic of Yeats's revisions, in commenting on the line 'And every mumbling old man said' from the second version of the poem, remarks that the metre exacts 'an unnatural emphasis [on the word 'old']' and that Yeats improved the metre for Poems (1895) by changing the line to 'And every ancient Ollave said.' But in the first version this line has a metre similar to the final metre: 'And every whispering Druid said.' There are other examples at hand, but these illustrate sufficiently something of the problem inherent in the term 'early poem' and likewise the possible errors inherent in a study of 'the early version' of a poem. To come back to my question, 'What is an "early Yeats poem"?', I should answer it by saying that it is a poem written originally before 1892. And immediately I should add that in any discussion of such a poem the details of its early publication must be given and the exact printing date of any quotation. Revisions of the early poems continued, as I said, right up to the end. It is not until the definitive edition, for example, that we can clear up the vexing question of whether line 39 in 'The Song of the Happy Shepherd' should be 'Rewarding in melodious guile' or 'Rewording in melodious guile.' The textual history of the line is curious and provocative. In the first printing, in The Dublin University Review for October 1885, and in successive printings up to the 1901 revision of Poems (1895), it was 'Rewording.' In the 1904 revision of Poems (1895) it became 'Rewarding.' In The Poetical Works I (1906) and The Collected Works I (1908) it is 'Rewording.' But in the 1908 revision of Poems (1895) and in all subsequent printings through Collected Poems (1933) it is 'Rewarding.' In the definitive edition it becomes 'Rewording'—a reversion to the original word and concept. (I am aware that what sometimes seem to be reversions in an author's work are nothing more in fact than the careless use of an earlier edition as copy for a later edition, but the reversions discussed in this paper were, I believe, purposely made by Yeats and represent a rejection of his own revisions.) Another revision in the same edition is a punctuational change—again a reversion—in line 7 of 'Ephemera,' 'When the poor tired child, Passion, falls asleep.' In the first printing, The Wanderings of Oisin , etc. (1889), the terminal punctuation was a period; but in the next printing, Poems (1895), the period was replaced by a colon that remained through Collected Poems (1933). The colon shifts the implication of the next two lines: 'How far away the stars seem, and how far / Is our first kiss, and ah, how old my heart!' In the definitive edition the period reappears. He even revised, in the definitive edition, his spelling of certain Gaelic names. In 'The Wanderings of Oisin,' for instance, 'Aed' becomes 'Aedh,' and 'Blanid' becomes 'Blanaid' (although the trade editions of 1950 and 1951 do not have the latter change 10 ). He makes several slight punctuational revisions in the same poem; an example is the deletion of the terminal commas of lines 405 and 406, Book I. Here are lines 404-407 as they appear in all printings from Poems (1895) through Collected Poems (1950-51) except the definitive edition: He hears the storm in the chimney above, And bends to the fire and shakes with the cold, While his heart still dreams of battle and love, And the cry of the hounds on the hills of old. And here they are in the definitive edition: He hears the storm in the chimney above, And bends to the fire and shakes with the cold While his heart still dreams of battle and love And the cry of the hounds on the hills of old. Apparently Yeats felt that the elision of the commas after 'cold' and 'love' make the last three lines more clearly modify, rather than be in apposition with, the first line. Collected Poems (1933), given frequently by textual critics as the source of numerous revisions, has actually not very many and they are not very extensive. Among them are the insertion of a comma after 'last' in line 33 of 'The Rose of Battle': 'And when at last, defeated in His wars'; the hyphenation of 'bean-rows' and 'honey-bee' in line 3 of 'The Lake Isle of Innisfree'; the final changing of 'will' to 'with' in 'When You Are Old': 'And loved your beauty with love false or true' [the printings oscillate between 'with' and 'will,' the first 'will,' 11 that displaces the original 'with,' being perhaps due to a misprint]; the substitution of 'fear' for 'fears' in line 6 of 'Who Goes with Fergus?': 'And brood on hopes and fear no more'—it had been 'fears' from the first printing in 1892; and a change in the punctuation in line 13 of 'The Two Trees': 'There the Loves a circle go.' This line, that Yeats first used in Selected Poems (1929), he originally punctuated 'There the Loves—a circle—go.' In 1933 he eliminated the dashes. In line 18, Book I, of 'The Wanderings of Oisin,' 'Where passionate Maeve is stony-still;', that makes dubious sense without a hyphen between 'stony' and 'still,' he hyphenates the phrase—another reversion, for it had been hyphenated in the first printing; and, also in 'The Wanderings of Oisin,' he changes the spellings of some of the Gaelic names. One of those changed is 'Conhor' that becomes 'Conchubar' and necessitates a rewording of line 80, book III, from 'And the names of the demons whose hammers made armour for Conhor of old' to 'And the name of the demon whose hammer made Conchubar's sword-blade of old.' Selected Poems (1929) includes thirteen of the shorter early poems and 'The Wanderings of Oisin.' Of the thirteen shorter poems, six are revised slightly. Two have major revisions, 'The Man Who Dreamed of Faeryland' and 'The Two Trees,' revisions often credited to Collected Poems (1933). One critic strides in thus: 'Yet in rewriting the poem ['The Man Who Dreamed of Faeryland'] for the 1933 Collected Poems . . . .' Our critic buttresses this surprising statement by boldly assigning the following versions of lines 41 and 42 to the 1901 revision of Poems (1895): Were not the worms that spired about his bones Proclaiming with a low and reedy cry . . . and then says they were revised in 1933 to Did not the worms that spired about his bones Proclaim with that unwearied, reedy cry . . . . He is almost right about line 41, but quite mixed up about line 42. In the original printing in The National Observer for 7 February 1891 the lines read: Were not the worms that spired about his bones A-telling with their low and reedy cry. Line 41 stayed unchanged until Selected Poems (1929) when it was revised to 'Did not the worms that spired about his bones': its final form. Line 42, however, went through several changes. The first was for its second printing, The Book of the Rhymer's Club (London, 1892), where it had a terminal comma added. It kept this form until Early Poems and Stories (1925) where it became 'Proclaiming with a low and reedy cry,' that was changed finally in Selected Poems to 'Proclaim with that unwearied, reedy cry.' The remaining revisions in the poem are likewise incorrectly assigned to 1933. We have lost four years in a poet's development. (Incidentally, no comment is made on one of the most striking 1929 revisions: 'That if a dancer stayed his hungry foot / It seemed the sun and moon were in the fruit' that replace 'A Danaan fruitage makes a shower of moons, / And as it falls awakens leafy tunes.') The extensive revisions in 'The Two Trees' for Selected Poems are exemplified by the changes in lines 13-20. The original version of these lines that except for two unimportant punctuational changes lasted from its first printing in The Countess Kathleen , etc. (1892) through the final reprinting in 1929 of Poems (1895), reads, There, through bewildered branches, go Winged Loves borne on in gentle strife, Tossing and tossing to and fro The flaming circle of our life. When looking on their shaken hair, And dreaming how they dance and dart, Thine eyes grow full of tender care: Beloved, gaze in thine own heart. Here is the revision for Selected Poems : There the Loves—a circle—go, The flaming circle of our days, Gyring, spiring to and fro In those great ignorant leafy ways; Remembering all that shaken hair And how the wingèd sandals dart, Thine eyes grow full of tender care: Beloved, gaze in thine own heart. becoming, I think, a clearer statement of the desirability-of-innocence theme so superbly expressed ten years earlier in 'A Prayer for My Daughter.' For 'The Wanderings of Oisin' there are fifty-two changes, forty-two of which are punctuational with seven of the forty-two changes being reversions. The remaining ten changes are word and phrase revisions, with five 'maidens' becoming 'ladies.' One wonders whether to ascribe this to the years or better diction. Revisions for Early Poems and Stories (1925) and for the 1927 edition of Poems (1895) are considerable, among others being 'Fergus and the Druid,' 'A Cradle Song,' 'The Sorrow of Love,' 'The Lamentation of the Old Pensioner,' and 'To Ireland in the Coming Times' for the 1925 volume; 'The Ballad of the Foxhunter' and 'The Countess Cathleen in Paradise,' for the 1927 volume. 'The Dedication to a Book of Stories selected from the Irish Novelists' was revised originally for its publication in The Irish Statesman for 8 November 1924; it was printed in Early Poems and Stories in its revised form. 'Cuchulain's Fight with the Sea' has numerous revisions for both volumes; we might glance at these revisions, in particular the revised ending and some criticisms of it. For Early Poems and Stories Yeats changed the title from 'The Death of Cuchulain,' deleted seven lines, and redid forty-two of the remaining eighty-six lines. For the 1927 Poems he deleted one line and redid twenty-two—ten of which he had just finished revising in 1925. Probably the most striking of the changes is the new ending of the poem, done for Early Poems and Stories . Here is the ending 12 Yeats revised: In three days' time, Cuchulain with a moan Stood up, and came to the long sands alone: For four days warred he with the bitter tide; And the waves flowed above him, and he died. and here the revision: Cuchulain stirred, Stared on the horses of the sea, and heard The cars of battle and his own name cried; And fought with the invulnerable tide. Criticism of the old vs. the new ending varies widely. We have this from one critic: 'The second [ending] is fine too, but has not the same sense of water flowing on and on that is heard in the other. "And the waves flowed above him and he died" hold the invulnerability of the sea, and the majesty . . . of death.' But another writes that the new ending 'transformed a mediocre poem into a work of quite extraordinary power.' A third apparently thought both endings were the same: 'The changes [in the revision of the entire poem] do not, however, concern the contents—apart from one small detail: the name Finmole has disappeared, . . .' A little textual reading, not studying, would have helped number three. Incidentally, I agree with the second critic—that the poem is transformed into a work of extraordinary power. 'The Lamentation of the Old Pensioner' was made over for the 1925 volume into an entirely new poem. This rewriting has been discussed again and again; so far as I know, however, no one has commented on the brilliantly bitter and savage satire in the mere use of the word 'transfigure.' 13 Numerous other revisions of the early poems occur in the following volumes 14 —going back chronologically from 1925: the 1912 reprinting of Poems (1895), The Collected Works I (1908), the 1901 reprinting of Poems (1895), the 1899 reprinting of the same volume, the 1895 Poems itself, The Countess Kathleen , etc. (1892), and The Wanderings of Oisin , etc. (1889). The last two are listed because of the many changes Yeats made between initial periodical publication and publication in these first two volumes of his verse. There is, as I have implied, a tendency either to ignore the earliest changes or to be unaware of them and to assign the first revisions to Poems (1895). I have emphasized by mention or discussion a number of the volumes for which the early poems were revised. A ranking of these volumes based on the number of revisions would show, in my opinion, Poems (1895) as easily the first, followed by The Countess Kathleen , etc. (1892), The Wanderings of Oisin , etc. (1889), the 1912 reprinting of Poems (1895), Early Poems and Stories (1925), the 1899 reprinting of Poems (1895), The Collected Works I (1908), the 1901 and the 1927 reprintings of Poems (1895) in that order, Collected Poems (1933), and The Poems of W. B. Yeats I (1949). A ranking based on the significance of the revisions would show Poems (1895) as again first, followed by the 1925, 1912, 1908, 1892, 1899, 1901, 1927, 1889, 1933, and 1949 volumes. Selected Poems (1929), despite its importance, is not listed because it includes less than half the early poems. I think my ranking of the order of significance would be authenticated by a detailed study, a study that I believe would likewise show that reversions in later printings of the early poems most often go back to the 1889 and 1908 volumes. Before leaving the early poems I'd like to call attention to some of the lines that should have been revised. One example is lines 15 and 16 of 'The Sad Shepherd': 'But naught they heard, for they are always listening, / The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.'—almost unchanged in all printings; another is lines 5-8 in 'The Falling of the Leaves,' with its tongue-twisting line 6: The hour of the waning of love has beset us, And weary and worn are our sad souls now; Let us part, ere the season of passion forget us, With a kiss and a tear on thy drooping brow. the third is lines 32 and 33 in Book 1 of the 'Wanderings of Oisin,' '"Why do you wind no horn?" she said, / And every hero droop his head?'—a hackneyed rhythm 'reminiscent,' as Peter Allt once remarked to me, of '"Shoot if you must this old grey head, / But spare your country's flag," she said.'; and, as a last example, line 51 in the same book of the same poem, 'Through bitter tide on foam-wet feet?' Yeats had a deal of trouble with this line. Finn is asking Niamh why she is paying a visit to his country. In The Wanderings of Oisin , etc. (1889) part of line 50 and line 51 read: Young maiden, what may bring Thy wandering steps across the sea? In Poems (1895) this becomes What may bring To this dim shore those gentle feet? In the 1899 revision of Poems (1895) 50 and 51 are What dream came with you that you came To this dim shore on foam wet feet? Fifty remained the same, but fifty-one received its final form in Early Poems and Stories (1925): Through bitter tide on foam-wet feet? Part of Niamh's answer—lines 57-59, in the final form they got in the 1912 revision of Poems (1895)—is perhaps even worse, . . ., these four feet [of her horse] Ran through the foam and ran to this That I might have your son to kiss. The later poems, using Yeats's own division, include everything from The Wind Among the Reeds (1899) to Last Poems and Plays (London; New York, 1940), a total of 346 poems. The observations made and the conclusions reached about any textual study of the early poems are likewise applicable to the later poems. This is borne out by the incidental references I have made so far to the texts of a few of the later poems. Beginning in 1903 a new textual source, the Dun Emer press, after 1907 called the Cuala press, comes into the picture. The Dun Emer press was started by Yeats's sister Elizabeth. Yeats himself took an active part in its work and for some years chose and edited the books it issued, as well as having most of his own poems, beginning with In the Seven Woods (1903), printed by it. As a matter of statistics, there are 308 poems in the definitive edition that date from 1903 to January 1939; of these, 264 are in Dun Emer-Cuala books and of that number 94 are first printings. Because of Yeats's close supervision of the Cuala press books, one might be led to believe that here is a textual source more important than others, and that here if anywhere would be a finality not found in other printings. But not so; the Cuala press printing of a poem is not on that account likely to show more permanence than any other printing of the poem. But apparently the magic of the words 'Cuala Press' indicated to at least one critic that if a Yeats poem was printed in a Cuala press edition the poem would never again be changed. So in discussing 'Broken Dreams' and 'The Second Coming' from 'the 1918 and the 1920 volumes, . . . The Wild Swans at Coole and Michael Robartes and the Dancer ,' he gives these two Cuala press volumes as the sources for his quotations from the two poems. But in both cases he quotes 1933 versions. This is not too serious for 'Broken Dreams' where the changes are minor, but it is rather disastrous for 'The Second Coming.' The version of that poem in Michael Robartes and the Dancer has, as lines 13 and 17, Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand; . . . Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds. Whereas we are told they read Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert . . . Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. Hence by an assumption of the inviolability of a Cuala press printing the chance of commenting on two of Yeats's most brilliant changes is lost: of pointing out, for instance, how 'somewhere in sands of the desert' brings into the poem a sense of the vastness and desolation of 'the lone and level sands' stretching 'far away'; and how 'Reel' for 'Wind' expresses far more effectively the bewildered terror of the desert birds. These revisions in 'The Second Coming' were actually made for Later Poems (1922) and were retained to the end, but because when he quotes the poem our critic italicizes 'Spiritus Mundi' in line 12 it is evident that he used the 1933 version where the italicization first appears. (Incidentally, there was no '1918' Wild Swans at Coole ; the Cuala edition was 1917 and the trade edition 1919. The colophon in the Cuala edition of Michael Robartes and the Dancer says it was finished on All Souls' Day, 1920, the title page reads 1921.) I have indicated that just as we are in trouble with the careless use of the phrase 'early poem,' so with the phrase 'later poem.' Here, for example, we have one of Yeats's biographers talking about the poems in In the Seven Woods (1903) and saying that 'The first, and perhaps the finest poem in the new "middle-aged" group, was "The Folly of Being Comforted."', and he then cites lines 7-14 of, presumably, the 1903 version of that poem, but actually of the 1933 version that except for one minor change made for the definitive edition is the final version. Now textually, he could hardly have picked a more difficult poem than "The Folly of Being Comforted.' From its publication in The Speaker for 11 January 1902, down through the definitive edition, there are 36 changes in the published versions and a complete shift of meaning in lines 8-11,—a shift that appears first in the Tauchnitz A Selection from the Poetry of W.B. Yeats (1913) and is completed in Collected Poems (1933). Lines 8-11, in the 1903 Dun Emer and trade editions of In the Seven Woods , were Time can but make her beauty over again Because of that great nobleness of hers; The fire that stirs about her, when she stirs Burns but more clearly; The terminal semi-colon at line 9 makes that line modify line 8; the comma after 'her' in line 10 makes the remainder of that line and line 11 modify the first part of line 10. In 1913, after some intermediate and relatively unimportant changes, the punctuation was changed significantly: Time can but make her beauty over again; Because of that great nobleness of hers The fire that stirs about her, when she stirs Burns but more clearly. Now line 8 stands by itself, line 9 modifies lines 10 and 11, and there is a specific meaning in lines 10 and 11. The next significant change was for Later Poems (1922) where a colon replaces the semi-colon in line 8; the last was for the 1933 printing where a terminal comma after 'stirs,' in line 10, finally gave Yeats, it would seem, the meaning or meanings he wanted. It is this 1933 version that we are presented with as the 1903 version: proof that when a 'later' as well as an 'early' Yeats poem is discussed and quoted the exact printing date of the quotation must be given and pertinent facts from the poem's printing history. The more important revision volumes for the later poems are The Wind Among the Reeds (1899)—on the basis of the many revisions from initial magazine printings; Poems 1899-1905 (1906); The Green Helmet and Other Poems (1912); Responsibilities (1916); Later Poems (1922); The Tower (London; New York, 1928); The Winding Stair and Other Poems (London; New York, 1933); Collected Poems (1933); and A Full Moon in March (London, 1935). It would be misleading to list these volumes in an order based either on number or significance of revisions, for in only two of them, Later Poems and Collected Poems , are more than a handful of the later poems printed or reprinted. As a matter of fact, the later poems in their entirety appear only in the definitive edition of 1949 and the trade editions of 1950 and 1951. These, then, are some of the textual facts and problems the student of Yeats must deal with. There are others: for instance, the existence of one version of a poem in the prose works and another version in the poetry volumes, examples being 'The Moods,' 'Into the Twilight,' and 'The Happy Townland'; 15 or the scores of title changes Yeats made; 16 or the changes made for, apparently, the sake of the rhythm only: 'They'd mauled and bitten the night through' to 'They mauled and bit the whole night through'; 17 or 'They'll cough in the ink to the world's end,' to 'All shuffle there; all cough in ink.' 18 Finally, two amusing revisions, the second probably a misprint. In the first printing of the poem 'Lullaby' in The New Keepsake (London, 1931) lines 3-6 read What are all the world's alarms? What were they when Paris found Sleep upon a golden bed That first dawn in Helen's arms? As revised for its next printing in Words for Music Perhaps and Other Poems (Cuala Press, Dublin, 1932) they become What were all the world's alarms To mighty Paris when he found Sleep upon a golden bed That first night in Helen's arms? In the succeeding printing, The Winding Stair and Other Poems (1933), line six reverts to That first dawn in Helen's arms? and remains so.

In three of the printings, The Gael (February 1903), 19 The Poetical Works I (1906), and Selected Poems (1921) the words 'high' and 'way' have been joined, and the line reads 'To love you in the old highway of love.'

Originally in The Bookman (August 1893).

      <field name="heading_text">The Accounts of the Wardens of the Stationers' Company by Cyprian Blagden</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN," WROTE ARBER, 1 "that the primary intention of this First Register was chiefly that it should be a permanent Record of the Wardens' annual Cash Accounts." I am going to try, in this paper, to reconstruct these Wardens' Accounts from 19 July 1557 to 15 July 1596—that is, for the first thirty-nine years of the Stationers' Company after its incorporation. 2 Arber's Transcripts , though they have yielded a great deal of information to students of English Literature, to bibliographers and to those interested in the activities of early Stationers, are unable, as they stand, to provide the sort of evidence one looks for in account books. The reason for this is obvious. Anyone working on the Transcripts must have wondered what was concealed by the little italicized notes within square brackets— [ Three entries omitted ]—and what was the sum of money received, for instance, from the old Wardens by the Wardens for the ensuing year. The missing entries are often, as Arber points out (p.320), mere repetitions of similar, and previous, entries; but sometimes they are interesting and very nearly always they are part of the financial picture. In the 1557 inventory of things in the cellar (p.66) the last item before the signatures is "a case com[?plete] w th letters for the corporacyun"; in the account for 1564/5 (p.281) there is a note of repairs to the hall amounting to £15 3 s. ; in that for 1569/70 (p.421) there is a grant of £2 4 s. to the poor; in 1580/1 (p.490) Timothy Rider is paid 6 s. 8 d. "for paines taken in goinge into the Cuntrey"; and so on. The most complete set of figures omitted occurs on p.113, and I have shewn below how I have used these in setting out the account for 1558/9. But the summaries which begin with the year 1571/2 (p.451) are all left incomplete, usually by the omission of totals on the receipts side and by the omission of individual items and totals on the expenditure side. In addition to these cases, in which the Transcript declares omissions, there are useful totals, both of separate pages of the Register and of whole years, to which the Transcript does not draw attention; these were no doubt added at the time the accounts were audited. There is no indication, for instance, on p. 79 that the following has been left out: nor that there is a total of expenditure given on p.223. It is possible to arrive at these figures, or at something like them, by totalling the receipts for the separate sections — entering of copies or fines for breaking orders; but the totals were presumably the figures on which the annual audit was based and their existence does bear out Arber's statement that Register A, 3 labelled on the spine "Wardens Accounts", was kept primarily for financial purposes. With the help of the figures not printed in the Transcript I have constructed the Table which appears at the end of this article. I must, however, make it quite clear now that there are no major discoveries, nothing to upset what is already known about the Company. There are small but interesting points like the existence of type (but apparently no press) at the time of the incorporation, and the Beadle's journey into the country on the Company's, and probably the Government's, business. But it is by the accumulation of unprinted details which usually, with the items to be found in the Transcripts , make up the unprinted totals, that the construction of a set of more or less balanced accounts has been possible; and it is from these that a little light can be thrown on the financial problems of the Company and the means by which it solved them. On 10 July 1559 the accounts of Jaques and Turk for the previous year were audited and the balance handed over, in the presence of ten members of the Court, to the new Wardens, Lobley (one of an interesting family) and Duxwell, who both signed for it. For some reason a summary (p. 113) of the year's accounts, of a kind not found again until July 1572, was made. Since only two items are printed complete, I give the whole account, in modern notation and with numeration added for reference. This final balance is twice repeated in the formal receipt. Unfortunately, the totals of the printed figures on pages Therefore 5 s. 10 d. shewn in one place as received was not there on 10 July 1559; moreover, the addition in (18) is a halfpenny out. The points are small, but I have drawn attention to them because the inaccuracy of sixteenth-century accounting is demonstrated several times in the following years. Furthermore, there is the occasional misplacing of an item. On page 99, among the Presentment of Apprentices etc., is the receipt of 4 d. from Thomas Marsh for licence to print a book; hence the figure for licensing of copies in the Table is £1 o s. 2 d. instead of the 19 s. 10 d. in (3); and on page 94, Caly's 8 s. 4 d. — 3 s. 4 d. for his freedom and 5 s. towards the hall — is entered amongst the fines and followed by Hill's arrears — no doubt of quarterage due to the Renters. The figures in the Table for the year 1558/9 do not, therefore, correspond in every case with the figures in the summary quoted above; but the redistribution leads to the same totals and, allowing for that vagrant halfpenny, to the same discrepancy on the receipts side. Of the payments made by Jaques and Turk the £5 10 s. 9 d. (11) is the sum of the items on page 106, the missing entries being: s d for two dinners in December and April 13 11 Scavenger 1 6 mending two guns 3 0 paper and brooms 1 6 fee of Lord Mayor's officer 6 8 The total of page 112, which is given in the original, is that shewn in (13), the three missing entries being: s d to the armourers 10 0 for twelve men's purses &amp;c.mmat; 8 d. each 8 0 carting harness 8 But how the total of the charges for the dinners is reached by adding the items on pages 107 to 110 defeats me; it obstinately refuses to come to more than £9 9 s. 3 d. , short of the printed figure on page 113 by 4 s. 4½ d. This difference between the calculated total of individual items and the given total in the summary — like the difference on the receipts side — has forced me to include, in the Table, a line for adjustments on each side of the annual accounts. In selecting the headings for the "Charge" or receipts side of the Table, I have, in the main, been governed by the summaries which begin on page 451. This has meant amalgamating the fines for disobedience with the fines for printing without licence, which in 1558/9 were separated. On the other hand, the value of a heading for Rents, and of other headings which do not find places in 1559, will appear later. Nearly all these sources of income were common to all City Companies; but two of them — the licensing of copies and the sale of books — could belong only to the Stationers' Company. Neither of them was of great economic importance; the former provided a steady flow of cash which, in the earlier years, was more valuable than the fees for enrolling apprentices and, in 1578/9, reached nearly £9: the latter might have come to play a more obviously important part (as it threatened to do between 1589 and 1593) if the English Stock had not developed into a separate trading organization within the framework of the Company. 4 It might be argued that fines for printing without licence made a third source of income which could arise only in the Stationers' Company; so too might fines for binding books contrary to the regulations. I have, however, chosen to regard these, special as they are to the Stationers, as parallelled by similar disciplinary measures in other Companies — Thomas Huat's fine by the Carpenters in 1567, for instance, "for that his borde did not beare measure ij s vj d " 5 — in a way that the fee paid for the entry of a licence to print was, so far as I know, unparallelled. The headings on the "Discharge" or expenditure side of the Table were more difficult to keep within reasonable bounds without destroying their individual significance. In the year 1591/2 there are over sixty entries for sums paid out, totalling nearly £70 and ranging from 6 d. paid for carpenters to £14 17 s. 11 d. repaid to John Wolf for new chimneys and wainscotting in "the Lower Rowme". Moreover, it is not always possible to discover whether charges for legal advice or "writing" were for property transactions, for Company ordinances or for action taken against pirates. It will be best, therefore, to give an indication of what to expect under each heading. Wages contains payments to the full-time servants of the Company, the Beadle and the Clerk; whether the Porter was paid by the Renters or existed on what he could pick up, I do not know. Remuneration for additional work at times of crisis is put under the heading appropriate to the business undertaken, usually Legal Action . The apparent irregularity in the payment of salaries I shall refer to later. Retaining fees deals with the standing charges for the Company's counsel, which was sometimes as high as £3 for two of them; and with the payments made to certain officers of the City — the Lord Mayor's "man", the Butler, the Cook, the Armourer and the Scavenger. 6 Under Property I should have liked to distinguish between expenditure on the hall and expenditure on other property; and under the former to differentiate between the purchase of buckets or brooms and the much more important items like bricks and mortar or carpenters' wages. But there are so many borderline cases and, in the later years, so many doubts about where building operations were carried out, that I was forced to lump all these items together. The policy controlling the contribution to Dinners varied according to the Company's own financial position and according to City edicts. The standard payment, almost throughout the period, was £5 for the feast on the Sunday after St Peter's day (p.164). Attempts were made to make the Company contribute to the Livery Dinner and to one or other of the Quarter Day Dinners; and there were odd special occasions — when the Queen came to the City and in honour of Mrs Kevall's bequest in 1592. But the Court wisely refused to allow the Company's money to be eaten away by a too heavy recurring charge. I have kept the unimportant item Sermons , partly because it is always clearly distinguishable in the accounts, partly because it is a tenuous link with the medieval practice of a gild, and partly because it is one of the customs which is still kept up. As a Liveryman, I have recently been "desired by the Master and Wardens" to meet them at the hall on Ash Wednesday and to "accompany them, according to custom, to the chapel of St Faith in the crypt of St Paul's cathedral, to attend the service of the day, and to hear a sermon". Cakes and ale will be available at the hall on the morning of that day. In 1571/2 the Company subscribed £2 towards the Bishop of London's fund for Exhibitions for poor scholars at Cambridge, but from March 1580 it supported Thomas Draper at Oxford and from 1585 Benjamin Gonneld at Cambridge. £13 was the largest sum paid out during this period, but the support of these boys indicates both the determination of the Company to make its expected contribution and its financial ability to do so. The Stationers' Company School, founded nearly 100 years ago, still has the Company's support. From this charitable venture it is a logical step to the relief of the Poor . The missing entry on page 244 is for 6 s. 6 d. given "to the good Wyf burker of charyte by consent of the Mr Wardens &amp; assestaunt s "; and most years thereafter shew similar payments, often to those whose connection with the Company is not apparent. These payments received official sanction at a Court held on 2 July 1565, 7 when it was "agreed and establesshed by the Mr Wardens and Comõallty" (an interesting phrase) that 40 s. a year out of the common stock might be spent in this way and that unspent balances might be carried forward. In a troublesome year like 1582/3 the contribution from the general fund was nearly £5. This does not include the 5 s. to be paid immediately (8 April 1583) 8 by the Renters to Peter French, nor his annual pension of £1 voted the same day. It is likely, therefore, that in those years when no charity is recorded in these accounts, some charity was being paid out of the Renters' funds; but, from an analysis of the decisions of the Court, it seems that, while the Wardens were normally to make ad hoc payments to relieve immediate distress, the Renters were to be responsible for recurring expenditure, i.e. for pensions. It is probable that these last were to be met out of the royalties of 6 d. in the £ payable for permission to reprint certain books over which the Court claimed control. The account book for this fund is first mentioned in July 1585 (p.512) and the credit balance is recorded each succeeding year. In 1594 the balance stood at something over £8 and after 1603 the fund was firmly established on the basis of an annual payment of £200 from the profits of the English Stock. In addition, the annual returns from the bequests of William Lamb and Thomas Duxwell probably passed through the Renters' hands, as did the small sums bequeathed by many other Stationers. The granting of interest-free Loans is a natural extension of charitable activities, but until the bequest of William Norton 9 began to operate (after this period) the beneficiaries were not, as one might have expected, young men setting up in business but established members of the Company like Fayreberne the Beadle (p.392) or men in trouble like Roger Ward (p.566). There is no indication how much money came in from Stephen Kevall's bequest. By his will, 10 he had divided the proceeds of some property between the poor of St Mary at Hill and the poor of the Company. Jane Kevall, who had a life interest, died in 1573, but it is seven years before there is a record (here under the heading Bequest Money ) of any payment to the churchwardens of St Mary at Hill. Whether the Company had had difficulty in collecting the rent, as the legal charges on page 491 suggest, or whether it had taken all the money for its own poor until compelled by law to disburse half, is not clear. All we know for certain is that £50 was received for a pair of twenty-one-year leases; but we can be fairly sure that, at least from 1580, an income of not less than £10 (and the expenditure of £2 8 s. for a Hall Dinner on 6 May 1592 suggests that at one stage it was more) was collected by the Renters and that half of this was available for the Company's poor. For some reason the Wardens and not the Renters were responsible for the payment to the churchwardens. Under the heading of Defence I have put all those payments which, by royal or City edict, the Company had to make towards providing troops or warships. Corn etc. contains similarly unavoidable contributions towards the provision of corn or salt, towards the loan for rebuilding Yarmouth harbour and aid for Geneva. Whether these contributions were loans or not, they were usually offset by special subscriptions from individual members. Taxes , on the other hand, were levied on the hall and were the responsibility of the Company. The only point to notice about them is the frequency with which Arber omitted them from his Transcripts . The last two items of expenditure, Legal action and Search Dinners , are in some ways the most important. In the first place, the Company, as part of the condition of its incorporation, became both an instrument of the government and an instrument of the highest ecclesiastical authority; it was therefore forced to take action not only, like any other Company, against those who had broken gild rules, but against those who, in the manufacture or distribution of the printed word, were thought to have offended against state or church. In the second place, the members of the Company manufactured and distributed a commodity which was — and still is — fantastically more expensive, per unit, to produce in small numbers than to produce in large; the Company had to provide, therefore, some sort of protection for the man who had undertaken the expense of setting up the type for a book while he, and not a pirate, got his money back from its sale. These two problems — the suppression of treasonable and recusant literature and the prevention of copy-right infringement — are still exceedingly, and sometimes were then deliberately, confused; the point here is that they cost the Company a great deal of time and a certain amount of money. There were lawyers' fees and police expenses; there were journeys to Whitehall, Fulham and Greenwich (and further afield): there were "sweeteners", in money and in kind; there was the cost of drafting ordinances and decrees. These items of expenditure might yield, through analysis, a very interesting picture of the Company's development; here they have had to be lumped together and put with what are the more normal outgoings of a corporation — expenditure arising from the ownership of property, for instance. I have, however, kept the costs of Search Dinners separate because they are clearly labelled and because they shew more quickly than anything else the amount of time — otherwise unrewarded — put in by the senior members of the Company on Company's business. I think it reasonable to say, after a close study of these accounts and of the accounts of the English Stock which have survived from the seventeenth century, that financial policy in the Stationers' Company should be rated no higher than a determination to remain solvent, and that, in the first thirty-nine years of its existence after the granting of a Charter, it comfortably achieved solvency. Even if the making of a profit on a year's working had been a more fully developed idea in the sixteenth century, it would still not have been the function of the Company to make a profit. Moreover, the lack of personal continuity in the office of "treasurer", who from 1571 was always the Under Warden (p.451), worked against any tendency there may have been to plan ahead and to make expenditure wait on income. When the necessity arose of finding the cost of a muster or the lawyers' fees for the Star Chamber Decrees or the contractors' bills for alterations to the hall, benevolences were demanded from individual members of the Company, and the Assistants had to set a good example to the Livery and to the Yeomanry. This attitude to finance, which is still a fairly usual one in personal matters, was probably the almost universal attitude during the reign of Elizabeth I and largely explains why I have had to devote so much more space to the headings of expenditure than to those of income. It might seem that the steadily increasing balance carried forward which, from a debit of £2 5 s. 3 d. in 1574 became £106 4 s. 8 d. in 1585, was a contradiction of my statement about policy, and that the expenditure in the year 1586/7, which reduced the balance with a thump to 14 s. 2 d. , had been carefully saved for during the previous eleven years. But it is most unlikely that the idea of buying, from the Government, greater authority for the Company can have arisen much before 1580 or that, by the time such an idea began to take shape (which it did by 29 October 1584 when the Court authorized the Wardens to spend money on an Act of Parliament), the cost would be as much as £73. As it was, the Court ordered on 18 July 1586 a payment of £40 to their lawyer Grafton "w ch is to [be] levied againe in forme folowing". But only £22 was collected, which barely covered the succeeding two years' legal expenses; since there was money in the Corn account and money in the common stock, the senior members of the Company saw no necessity to put their hands too deeply into their own pockets. The next five years were difficult and expensive, and the Company was able to avoid asking for benevolences (except for Corn and Gunpowder) only by a windfall of £50 from the granting of leases on the Kevall property. But in the last four years the previous ratio of income to expenditure returned, and a deficit of £6 16 s. 7 d. became in July 1596 a balance of £44 8 s. 8 d. The Company had weathered the storm brought on by the battle over the monopolies and, with the granting in 1603 of the Patent for what became the English Stock, was economically soundly based. It is difficult, from the figures in the Table, to trace the fortunes of the Company in much greater detail. We can say that it had, during the first thirty-nine somewhat inflationary years after incorporation, fulfilled its obligations to the City and to the Crown (usually by special calls on its members, though the Serving of the Corn Market became a standing charge on the Company); that it had, with little help from its members, managed to pay about £240 (excluding counsel's standing charges) in legal expenses of one kind and another; that it had, helped in the early years by benevolences and donations, spent over £250 on improving its property; that its capital position had been bettered by gifts of silver — legacies and presents from retiring officers — and by a noble gift of property. There are also two small but clear indications that the Company was gaining in confidence. On 21 January 1578 the fee for enrolling an apprentice was raised from 6 d. to 2 s. 6 d. ; though the purpose was to limit the number of apprentices, it is clear that its effect was to increase the revenue. 11 A year later the first fine was paid for the avoidance of office. The plainest indication, however, of the steady progress of the Company lies in the entries under the heading "Cash from Renters". This was always a clear credit and quite independent of the previous year's balance. The average for the first five years was a little under £11; for the years 1581 to 1585 it was nearly £23; and for the last five years when, as I shall shew, the commitments were heavy, it was still well over £16. Unfortunately, the Renters' Books have not survived and one is forced to deduce both the items which the Renters were responsible for paying and the sources from which their income was derived. It is well known that, as collectores , they collected quarterage, 4 d. a quarter from each full member of the Company. I should be surprised if this yielded more than £14 in any one year; the number of names in the Charter is under 100; 150 members, if they all paid, would have contributed £10; £2 6 s. 8 d. is shewn (p. 102) as a part payment for six months' quarterages and £9 5 s. 4 d. as the whole of the quarterages for the previous year (p.72) "as appereth by thayre boke of collection"; in 1560/1 (p.160) three quarters and arrears produced £6 6 s. 9 d. ; the petition of (?) 1582 (p.111) says the number was 175; an assessment of 1632 12 gives the membership of the Company as about 225. It is equally obvious that they collected the rents. But regularly up to 1564 receipts of rents are shewn in the Wardens' accounts (and, astonishingly, in 1570/1) even though they were collected, as in 1558/9, by the Renters; and these figures suggest that, up to the time when the Kevall property began to produce income for the Company, the letting of the property yielded about £5 a year. (For some reason the hiring out of the hall was normally controlled by the Wardens.) But the Renters must have had other sources of revenue. The summary of accounts for 1571/2 (p.451) refers to these as "such like over and above their Allowaunces". What the "such like" were I have no evidence, but that they were substantial, regular and increasing is proved by the growth of the "Allowaunces". These fall under two main heads — wages and poor relief. Between 1566 and 1569, and from 1573, the wages of the Company's servants were paid by the Renters. These were probably only £4 a year in 1573; but from 3 June 1580 the Beadle's salary was raised to £6 and on 3 August 1591 Wolf, as Beadle, had his salary increased to £10, having previously arranged a payment to himself of £3 a year for the supply of fuel for the hall. It is probable that the Clerk was at this time receiving £4 from the Renters, in addition to payments for "writings" which he had from the Wardens; and something may have been paid to the Porter. As I have already pointed out, the Renters were probably required to make certain payments to the poor even before the institution of the 6 d. in the £ scheme, and were liable to be saddled with the pensions; they probably also administered the Lamb and Duxwell (and possibly other) bequests. On the basis of this inadequate evidence a very rough balance sheet can be compiled for 1595/6 which will at least shew the importance of these lost accounts in the general pattern of the Company's finances. Since collections for and payments to the poor were at this time kept separate, I have omitted them. The only uncertain figure on the expenditure side is the Clerk's salary; 13 but there were probably other items for which the Renters were responsible. The points I want to make are that at least £33 of income (excluding money earmarked for the poor) was accruing to the Company, at the end of the period, through the hands of the Renters, and that only the unexpended balance of this amount finds a place in the Table. I want to finish with brief accounts of two of the Company's investments in something other than land. In the year 1586/7 (p.520) £18 10 s. was laid out by the Wardens on the purchase of 750 "shorte Dyctionaryes" at 49 s. 4 d. per 100. This book, as Mr F.S. Ferguson has been kind enough to point out, is almost certainly John Withal's, which was reprinted in quarto by Thomas Purfoot in 1586 (STC 25881). Though the Assistants made several efforts at this time to put work in the way of printers, and though they passed an order on 18 January 1585 that Purfoot was to have the printing of the first leaf of the Little Catechism , there is no record in the Court Book of such an exceptional step as the purchase from a printer of what must have been a large part of the lawfully printed edition of a book. The explanation of the action must, I think, be that it was part of the policy of giving printers work enough to keep them from interfering with the books of the patentees; and it is worth noting that the "treasurer" this year was Henry Denham, a powerful and outspoken monopolist. The story of this isolated venture into publishing emphasizes both the charitable nature of the transaction and the fact that the Company was run like a club or learned society and was not primarily a profitmaking organization. At the end of the year succeeding the purchase, the 750 copies were still in stock. During 1588/9 twenty-five were sold to Edward White, through John Wolf, for 12 s. 4 d. , the rate at which they had been bought. In the next three years the sales were 125, 56 and 100. In 1592/3 a further twenty-five were sold at the normal rate and 418 to Thomas Woodcock at a shade over 4 d. a copy. With one copy unaccounted for, the loss to the Company was £1 9 s. 8 d. In the other example, both the investment and the profit were unavoidable. By an Act of Common Council of 16 June 1591 a loan was exacted from the City Companies to furnish ships for Howard's and Ralegh's expeditions. 14 The Stationers' share was £80, equal to that of the Barber-Surgeons, the Whitebakers and the Sadlers, but only half that of the Dyers and Brewers, and only about a quarter that of the Vintners, the poorest of the big twelve. At the first call £53 6 s. 8 d. was subscribed and at the second call £41 7 s. , an additional assessment of £14 13 s. 8 d. over the £80 originally required. The money was raised in the following way: The debit was made up by George Allen, the Under Warden and was refunded to him by Conway and Stirropp, the Wardens for the following year. I first assumed that they paid this out of their own pockets, since there is no record of the amount in their accounts; and this assumption may be correct. But on page 565 the contribution of the Company, when it came to calculating the dividend of 24 s. in the £, is clearly given as £14 8 s. 4 d. , the £10 from the Common Stock and £4 8 s. 4 d. the repayment to Allen as it was misrecorded. If Conway and Stirropp did dip into their own purses, why did they not subscribe on their own accounts? If they did not, where did the money come from? To these questions I have no answers; and for good measure I throw in what is to me another little mystery which involves a similar appearance of money like a rabbit out of a hat. On page 129 (1559/60) the entry left out by Arber reads as follows: "Rd out of the cheste by the hands of the m rs for the corporations vj li xiij s iiij d ". It is, I suppose, good for us that additional information does not automatically lead to a clearer understanding; nevertheless, I hope that the following Table — with its new material — will lead rather to clarity than to confusion. Note : In the Table that follows, an asterisk denotes a figure not printed by Arber; this may be either a total or an individual item which happens to be the whole and not part of a heading. Since printing in red is expensive a minus sign in the Adjustments lines is the sole indication of excess expenditure or excess receipt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Transcript (1875), I, 31. In what follows, all bracketed page numbers refer to this volume of the Transcripts . 2 I am grateful to the present Master, Wardens and Assistants of the Stationers' Company for permission to use unpublished material; and I should like to make it clear both how much I admire the work of Professor Arber and also that I intend no criticism of him in drawing attention to the entries in the Registers still unprinted. 3 This is not the same as Liber A, "Orders of Parliam t . &amp; L d Mayor", which has not been printed, except in part, and which Arber was not permitted to use. 4 See "The English Stock of the Stationers' Company", The Library , 5th ser., X, (1955), 163-185. 5 E. B. Jupp, An Historical Account of the Worshipful Company of Carpenters (1887), p. 137. 6 For an account of these officers, see Sir Walter Greg's Introduction to The Records of the Court of the Stationers' Company, 1576-1602 (1930). This book is cited hereafter as Greg. 7 Liber A, f.8r. 8 Greg, p. 13. 9 Though the Company had expectations from Arthur Pepwell, whose will was copied into Liber A (ff.12v-13v), the survival of a grandchild to the age of twenty-one must have prevented their realization. See H. R. Plomer, Abstracts from the Wills of English Printers and Stationers (1903) p. 16. 10 Plomer, op. cit. , p. 18. 11 It is interesting that there is no reference to this in the Court Book, although on 27 January the "poore men" submitted a petition in which they complained of the excessive number of apprentices. 12 Liber A, ff. 140 ff. 13 But according to Liber A, f. 38r (29 October 1578), he was to have 40 s. a year, in addition to his ordinary salary of 40 s. , while he was living away from the hall; and on 17 January 1599 (Greg, pp. 67/8) the Court ruled that he was still to be paid £4 a year even though he had moved back to the quarters in the hall. 14 The evidence is set out in the Transcript , I, pp. 544, 552, 558, 569 and 575; and in Liber A, ff, 61v-63v and 64v-64r.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Principles of Annotation: Some Suggestions for Editors of Shakespeare by Alice Walker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I HAVE CHOSEN PRINCIPLES OF ANNOTATION AS MY topic 1 for two main reasons: the first is because new principles would greatly reduce the formidable weight of explanatory matter with which editions of Shakespeare are often overloaded; the second is because a more critical standpoint would appreciably strengthen the hand of the literary critic in what will always be his related responsibility—the editing of the text. It should cause no surprise that I place the task of editing Shakespeare on the literary expert. During the present century there has been a great deal of confused thinking about this matter. Briefly, what the position amounts to is this. An editor's first duty is to arrive at some conclusion about the transmission of the text. This is the field in which the bibliographer operates, but only in the most fortunate circumstances can the bibliographer recover a definitive text. That the most fortunate circumstances did not attend the transmission of Shakespeare's plays is now common knowledge: one adverse factor to be reckoned with (perhaps the most important) is that most of Shakespeare's printers made no serious effort to guard against compositors' errors. When, therefore, all is known that we are likely to know about the transmission of Shakepearian texts, there will always be a residuum of compositors' errors which can only be detected by literary means. The two great fallacies of twentieth-century editorial theory have been, (1) the assumption that fuller knowledge about transmission would establish which readings were right and which were wrong, and (2) that palaeography would serve as the main tool in emendation. Errors due to carelessness (omission, interpolation, repetition, anticipation, and so on) are, in fact, commoner than misreadings in Folio plays set from autograph. The text of Antony and Cleopatra , which I shall use for demonstration in this paper, illustrates the position. We do not yet know precisely what Jaggard's proof-reading of this play amounted to, but the known proof-corrections make it fairly certain that it was perfunctory and that proof was not read with copy. The text was set by the untrustworthy Compositor B and it would not be remarkable if it contained well over 200 errors, mostly due to carelessness. Only the most intimate understanding of Shakespeare's idiom will enable an editor to determine which readings are errors. It is not enough to conclude that sense can be made of the matter as it stands in the Folio. The question is whether the sense is what Shakespeare intended and whether the words an editor is interpreting are Shakespeare's words or compositor's errors. About 80 readings are usually emended in this text, leaving probably 2 out of every 3 errors unaccounted for. Of the 80 errors now usually emended, only 1 out of every 3 is explicable as a misreading. I take a very simple example of a questionable reading. 'With news the time's with labour' is the Folio reading at III.vii.80 2 . Rowe substituted 'in labour'. Is the Folio reading, which is contrary to Elizabethan idiom, what Shakespeare wrote or is the repeated 'with' merely a compositor's error? Mr. Ridley (in the New Arden edition) accepted Rowe's emendation (rightly, I think), remarking that 'the compositor would easily pick up and repeat the with from five words before' and that ' with labour is an almost impossible phrase'. I have no quarrel with this, except that the last observation sounds too much like a personal opinion on a matter that should be approached from an historical standpoint. There are here two questions: (1) what was the idiom of Shakespeare's day, and (2) how far Shakespearian usage was in accordance with it. On the evidence of the Oxford English Dictionary, the facts appear to be that 'with labour' in the sense of 'in travail' is without parallel and that the idiom was either 'in travail' (the older expression) or 'in labour'. That Shakespeare knew this is evident from his use of both expressions elsewhere. If I seem to be making a mountain out of a molehill over a reading which most editors would probably have emended had they realised that nothing effective was done to guard against compositors' slips of this kind in the Folio, it is because what I want to stress is the need for a new attitude towards Shakespeare's language in the light of the material now available in the Oxford Dictionary. The Dictionary was completed in 1928 and ought to have revolutionised the annotation of Shakespeare. The response to this wealth of new material has been sluggish, and editors now seem more interested in Elizabethan phonology and orthography (matters about which we as yet know very little) than in the critical appreciation of the words Shakespeare used. How many, I wonder, could say off-hand how far Shakespeare's language was the current coin of his day and how far it was his own minting? Editors leave the question obscure in spite of the fact that an historical approach to a writer's language is fundamental to both textual and literary criticism. 'Your dismission is come from Caesar' says Cleopatra (I.i.26-7): ' dismission . Similarly for dismissal in Cymbeline , II.iii.57' say the notes of both Arden editions. But would it not be more useful if readers were told that 'dismission' was the normal English word down to the early nineteenth century when 'dismissal', which has now replaced it, first (seemingly) appeared? Similarly, both Arden editions, glossing the adjective 'semblable' (III.iv.3), compare 2 Henry IV and mention, quite irrelevantly, that the word was also used as a noun, citing Day, 1599. The word (both as adjective and noun) was in use from the time of Chaucer, so that here again there was nothing remarkable in Shakespeare's use of the word, since it was current both long before and long after his time. It would have been more remarkable had he used its equivalent 'similar', which apparently first appears in Cotgrave, 1611. In the case of both these words what a reader needs to know is (1) what the word means, and (2) whether there was anything unusual in the use of it. The Arden notes meet the first requirement but not the second. Comparison with Cymbeline and 2 Henry IV is unenlightening and further parallels from other writers would merely show that Shakespeare's use of the word was not exceptional. The justification of the existence of a word by means of parallels is, of course, a legacy of the past. Before our day, editors were compelled to rely on their own reading, or that of earlier editors, and had no such panoramic view of the history of our vocabulary as the Oxford Dictionary now provides. Despite some shortcomings, it is now the authority for the vocabulary of Shakespeare's day. Would it not therefore be of critical service to have parallel passages, which so often give a misleading impression of the facts, swept out of our notes and to have a gentleman's agreement between editor and reader that, when a word is merely glossed without further comment, it can be assumed that the word was in ordinary use in Shakespeare's time in the sense given? A lot of matter that is merely distracting, and critically quite useless 3 , could then be discarded and enable editors to place the emphasis on what readers of Shakespeare are now most interested in-his artistry in the use of words and craftsmanship as a poet. As a fuller example of this suggestion, I take the word 'renegue' (I.i.8). Both Arden editions cite the Lear quarto reading, as well as parallels from Stanyhurst and Sylvester, and what is called 'a late instance' of 1684. This blurs a great deal of interesting information. According to the Oxford Dictionary, Udall introduced this Latinised form of the word; by the beginning of the seventeenth century it had supplanted the older 'renay', borrowed from the French, and it was still in use at the end of the nineteenth century 4 . There are here three facts that the ordinary reader needs to know: (1) that the word meant 'renounce'; (2) that it was in common use in Shakespeare's day; and (3) that the pronunciation was 'renegue' [g]. This could be conveyed in three lines by the simple gloss 'renegue' 'renounce', followed by the information that Sylvester's rhyme of 'renegue' with 'league' is evidence for the pronunciation. How much further information an editor gives depends, of course, on the kind of reader he is catering for. For school purposes more would be wanted; but if some of the three inches of space now occupied by parallels in the Arden edition could be used for developing points of interest, would it not be better to use it for relating this word to the general tendency of the period to remodel early French loan-words on their Latin form? My main concern here, however, is not with refinements of this kind but, rather, how to convey the necessary information about Shakespeare's vocabulary with the minimum of pother over what is now merely obsolete. If we suppose that 'dismission' 'dismissal' might serve as a conventional substitute for the older method of justifying a word and its meaning by parallels, the same convention would serve for indicating what was common usage in Shakespeare's figurative language. 'Stomach', for instance, at III.iv.12 is used figuratively for 'resent', and the Arden editions compare Danett's translation of Comines (?1596). What is interesting about the use of this word is that from the early sixteenth century, when the verb first appeared, it was invariably used figuratively and was never used for physical digestion until the nineteenth century. It may be a Ciceronianism, since Cicero seems to have been much given to the metaphor and had, perhaps significantly, a poor stomach. But, whatever the history of the verb in this transferred sense, 'stomach' (fig.) 'resent' (O.E.D.1)' would briefly show that the transferred sense was not only pre-Shakespearian but also the primary meaning in English. 5 I have so far suggested what might be done to reduce the annotation of the ordinary vocabulary of Shakespeare's day to its right proportions with the idea that this would throw the right emphasis on what is of greater significance—the words that he coined and his strategic use of figurative language for dramatic ends. 'He words me, girls, he words me' (V.ii.190) requires, for instance, more discussion than 'renegue', though neither Arden edition has here a note. The Oxford Dictionary describes this use of 'word' as obsolete and rare, glossing as 'to ply or urge with words' and citing only this instance. Onions, following Schmidt, more plausibly glosses as 'to flatter with words'. This may be a Latinism ( dare verba to flatter, deceive) and here comparison with another Shakespearian text is not otiose but apt, since 'words' in Cymbeline , I.iv.14-5 ('words him . . . a great deal from the matter'), possibly means 'flatters' too, though the Oxford Dictionary cites it as a nonce use, meaning 'to represent as in words', and Onions glosses as 'to speak of'. Similarly, Caesar's use of 'missive' for 'messenger' at II.ii.78 is on a very different plane from the figurative use of 'stomach' already mentioned. The Oxford Dictionary describes the sense as obsolete and rare, citing only the parallel in Macbeth and a verse example of 1649. The description of the sense as obsolete and rare, though probably true enough, is a little misleading, as this is an example of metonymy, frequently employed by Shakespeare in talks at high level, and Shakespeare's contemporaries would consequently have deduced that Caesar was very much on his dignity—as Cleopatra, for instance, was not when she spoke of Antony's 'dismission'. Time has blurred these distinctions, and we can only recover them by the kind of annotation which establishes an historical perspective. I am not forgetting that a poet's art depends largely on his selection of words from the common store; but if all new words, or rare meanings, were distinguished by even a brief comment (such as 'he words me' requires), we should, of course, recognise to what extent Shakespeare found what he needed in the language of his day. What he seemingly coined would, for the most part, need only the briefest notice. The old idea that there was something peculiarly licentious in Shakespeare's language unfortunately persists—and hence perhaps the tendency to see the hall-mark of Shakespeare in the oddity rather than in the norm. 6 In fact, most of Shakespeare's neologisms bear the stamp of nature—not eccentricity. Inspired by the same powerful sense of analogy as his imagery, they follow traditional patterns. Thus 'lowering' (I.ii.122) would need no more than the briefest of comment (or even no more than an asterisk) to draw attention to the fact that this is the first recorded use of the adverb as a verb, and it should now be possible to assume that the majority of well-taught school children will recognise the patterns (so admirably sketched by Bradley 7 which have contributed, at all periods, to the making of English. What I want to stress is the need to get the strands in the fabric of Shakespeare's language disentangled, so that one can see what his inheritance was and by what means he enriched it, both by art and nature. The happy mingle of what he selected and what he invented was Shakespeare's style, and until his language and style are understood textual criticism lacks the technique for discriminating between truth and falsehood in readings. I do not myself believe that the critical faculty of the best editors of the past was as unprincipled as it is sometimes made out to be. We now know that Shakespeare's formative years at the Stratford Grammar School were spent in the analysis and imitation of Latin poets and orators, with text-books like the Epitome of Susenbrotus to explain the poet's tools; and we know that in his early work he consciously applied the lessons he had learnt and that, with maturity, his style grew bolder and technique second nature. Shakespeare's early editors had the great advantage of working in much the same tradition and time may show that where editors between Pope and Johnson shared common interests with Shakespeare—as in their appreciation of an antithesis or oxymoron—they contributed more to the solution of textual problems than is now thought. The importance of rhetoric and what Shakespeare owed to Latin writers needs to be constantly borne in mind whenever the Oxford Dictionary describes Shakespeare's meaning as obsolete and rare. Shakespeare's figurative use of language (especially simple instances of metonymy—abstract for concrete, the part for the whole, and so on) was often classified by the Dictionary in this way, giving an appearance of licentiousness or oddity to what were merely the recognised devices of a poet; and what the Dictionary occasionally describes as 'poetic' is sometimes absurdly glossed: 'sea-wings' for 'sails' is explained, for instance, as 'means of flight by sea'. Schmidt's Lexicon , as in the gloss just cited, generally shows, in fact, a readier grasp of poetic devices than the Oxford Dictionary. Poetic language, unless it is conventional poetic diction, is, of course, resistant to semantic treatment: poetry must break loose; semantics must pin down. Having stressed the need for the kind of historical approach to Shakespeare's language which the Oxford Dictionary now makes possible, this is the first reservation I want to make about its use—that where meaning 'o'erflows the measure' it is intractable material for the lexicographer. The second necessary warning is that reliance cannot be placed on the Dictionary's terminal dates. 8 In a work of this magnitude oversights are inevitable. In the first volume of Jaggard's Treasury of Ancient and Modern Times , 1613, 9 for instance, some of the words escaped notice altogether: congruate (congruous), 585.b.38-9 10 gripply (covetously), 727.b.44 hinderous (impeding), 89.b.27 table pins (styles), 790.a.28 Other words are considerably later than the Dictionary's last entry. Among these are metally (metallic), 813.b.43—last entry 1559 prolocute (speak), 40.b.9—1st and only entry Levins, 1570 terin (siskin), 805.b.29-30—1st and only entry Chaucer wakewort (wild arum), 564.a.42—described by the Dictionary in a single entry for 1530 as 'some plant', though the Treasury identifies it (839.a.23) with the arum or wake-robin about which the Dictionary is more fully informed. Two other names for the same plant in the Treasury ( loc. cit. ), Calves-foot and Ramp , are similarly later than the Dictionary's last entries (for 1607 and 1611 respectively). Other words antedate the Dictionary's first entry: abra, cadabra (described as two barbarous words and an infallible help against the ague), 694.a.37—1st entry 1696 ambulatory (nomadic), 176.a.43—1st entry 1622 maniglions (bracelets), 523.a.14—1st and only entry 1704 trabilious (for 'atrabilious'), 477.a.15—1st entry 1651 Wisigoths , 795.b.19—1st entry 1906 These are but a selection 11 I offer this evidence not in any cavilling spirit, but as a warning against the assumption, sometimes too readily made, that the Dictionary's dates can be relied on. It is only reasonable to suppose that many words were current long before they found their way into print, even if the Dictionary was fortunate enough to spot their first appearance; and any word familiar from Latin authors read at school or popular books, like the Adagia of Erasmus, may have been in circulation decades before the first recorded use. It is very curious, for instance, that, although collision was apparently in use from the fifteenth century, collide does not appear until Burton in 1621, in spite of the Latin verb's having been used by much-read Latin writers—by Horace, for instance, and Quintilian. Hence, no one should be surprised if Burton's collide proved not to be the first use of the word in English. Similarly, it would be absurd to suppose that, since gripple , meaning 'covetous', had been in use from the Old English period, the adverb gripply was never used before Jaggard's Treasury of 1613. Though it is interesting to know when a word or meaning first seems to have made its début , no useful purpose would be served by encumbering the notes of an ordinary edition with information of this kind. The main aim should be to separate the current coin of Shakespeare's day from his own minting, bearing in mind that what is described by the Oxford Dictionary as 'rare' may be merely a recognised figure of speech and that some of the words which Shakespeare seems to have introduced may already have been current. We are accustomed to conventions in collation notes and in our day the traditional load has been considerably lightened by cutting out useless matter. Any similar conventions which removed the dead wood from explanatory notes, making it possible to separate the significant features of Shakespeare's diction from words which were ordinary to him but strange to twentieth-century readers, either because they are now obsolete or have changed in meaning, would provide a critical approach to his craftsmanship in the use of language which would be of service to all. It would, in particular, fortify judgment in determining what is right and wrong in substantive texts. As an instance of what is wrong, I cited at the beginning of this paper 'With news the time's with labour'. Is 'my knee shall bow my prayers' (II.iii.3), similarly emended by Rowe (to 'in prayers') another error of the same kind? This is the sort of question which is re-opened by what bibliographers have revealed about the transmission of Shakespeare's plays. The assumption that proof-correction was much more scrupulous than it is now known to have been has led to the disastrous state of affairs when greater confidence is placed in the accuracy of compositors than in the common sense and artistic sense of our greatest poet. The Oxford Dictionary is not, of course, the only work of editorial importance that has not been advantageously used by annotators. Everything relating to Shakespeare's style is significant—especially Baldwin's Small Latine , which takes us back to the Stratford classroom where Shakespeare served an apprenticeship to Latin poets. This, in turn, should renew interest in the texts of early eighteenth-century editors—especially Pope who, much as he deplored some aspects of Shakespeare's style, recognised the common bond in others. Is there, for instance, another error of repetition in the following lines (V.i.17-9)? The death of Antony Is not a single doom; in the name lay A moiety of the world. Pope emended to 'in that name lay', presumably to secure the right emphasis for sense and metre. Theobald, Johnson, and Capell accepted the change, but Malone (who had a most mischievous hand with style) restored the Folio reading. Did a similar error occur at IV.xiv.38-9? The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep The battery from my heart. The special shield should surely be balanced by the particularity which Johnson's conjecture 'This battery' supplies. The text of Antony and Cleopatra is rife with typical compositor's errors of all kinds. Sometimes the problem for an editor is one of sense and style (as in the examples just cited). Sometimes it is one of imagery. Is, for instance, Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears (II.v.24) really an image of forcible feeding, as the customary comparison with Julius Caesar and The Tempest implies—or is Hanmer's emendation 'Rain' (an easy misreading) more apt to the context? At other times, the problem is one of dramatic intention. Did Shakespeare write 'made their bends adornings' (II.ii.212), intending by this clutter of consonants no more than a graceful tableau of Cleopatra and her Nereids—or did he write 'adoring', 12 carrying on the love-symbolism of 'in the eyes' and the motive of the love-sick winds and amorous water? I mention these points as reminders that every kind of interest in Shakespeare's art has its part to play in the detection of errors and emendation. The need to get the new material in the Oxford Dictionary into focus is, however, the prime necessity because past editors, however enlightened their appreciation of craftsmanship, can give the twentieth-century critic no help in getting Shakespeare's idiom into historical perspective. This has only recently been made possible. At the beginning of this paper I mentioned that a more critical use of the Dictionary would greatly reduce the burden of annotation with which texts of Shakespeare are still encumbered. I have also pointed out that we have now cleared collation notes of much useless matter and that the same policy might advantageously be followed in explanatory notes. Gould's suggestion that Antony's eyes should glow like plated 'stars' rather than plated 'Mars' (I.i.4) is, for instance, the kind of emendation that is best forgotten. Might not the New Arden edition similarly have ignored Staunton's suggestion, discussed in the explanatory notes, that the 'varying shore of the world' was an error for the 'varying star' (IV.xv.11)? Any reader of Latin poets would have recognised what the 'varying shore of the world' meant 13 , though he might, with reason, have suspected that the plural 'shores' was more in accordance with poetic idiom. Explanatory notes should, in fact, show the same kind of discrimination as collation notes: what is not worth recording in the one does not merit discussion in the other, unless an editor is rejecting a traditional reading. The left hand should know what the right hand is doing. The disproportionate amount of space now devoted to the discussion of readings should, however, shrink to more manageable proportions when it is realised to what extent and along what lines emendation is wanted. I have assumed in this paper that all editions of Shakespeare have the common purpose of presenting a text as verbally pure as possible, with explanatory matter to bridge the gap between Shakespeare's language and our own. In the present century, editors have discarded the traditional literary tools. They need them all —and new ones too— for building on the foundations laid by bibliographers; and among the new tools none is of greater importance than the historical study of Shakespeare's language which has only been possible since the completion of the Oxford Dictionary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 A paper read on September 5th, 1955, at the 7th International Shakespeare Conference at Stratford-upon-Avon. The paper is here unaltered except for the addition of footnotes. My thanks are due to Professor Bowers and Professor R. C. Bald for reading the paper in an earlier draft and for constructive criticism. From Professor Bald's comments on unpublished work and projects at a standstill it is clear that lexicographical work needs more encouragement than it has recently had. An editor's work is of especial value since no one is more likely to understand what is at issue than those who have made a special study of a particular author or text. 2 References are to the Cambridge edition, 1891-93. 3 The more so, since the parallels cited often introduce fresh difficulties for the uninstructed—old spelling and unfamiliar words which require at times more explanation than the text itself. 4 It is living yet. Both Professor Bowers and Professor Bald pointed out to me that the word is still used for revoking at cards (the latter citing Webster). I am also told it is used in the game of dominoes. 5 Since this paper was written, Professor Black has set an admirable example in his Variorum Richard II . It is much to be hoped that his lucid and economical method of recording the Dictionary's information will be followed. 6 I suspect this underlies the popular notion that, given a choice of readings, the rarer word will be Shakespeare's, since, so the argument runs, no scribe or compositor would have introduced it. So far as I know, no one has estimated the range of vocabulary a scribe acquainted with the King's Men's plays might have acquired nor how the vocabulary of Jaggard's compositors differed from that of Roberts's. In view of Shakespeare's ridicule of eccentricity in Holofernes, Armado, Osric, and the tribe of Clowns who fed on the almsbasket of words, we ought to be chary of supposing that the value of a word was enhanced by its rarity. 7 Henry Bradley, The Making of English , 1904. 8 In making these two general reservations I do not wish to imply that the O.E.D.'s verdict can otherwise be taken as final. Many of its glosses need reconsideration as most editors by now will know. 9 Jaggard's Treasury volumes, translated by Thomas Milles and published in 1613 and 1619, were compilations of the kind popularised by the Silva de Varia Lecion of the Spanish chronicler, Mexia. Mexia's work was imitated by an Italian, Gieronimo Giglio, whose Nuova Seconda Selva (1565) was pillaged by Du Verdier for his Diverses Leçons (1576), an immensely popular work which served as model and a main source for Milles. The original Silva and its successors were omnibus volumes covering a wide range of topics -social, political and natural history etc., much of it drawn from Aelian, Paulus Diaconus, Polydore Vergil, Guevara, and so on. 10 References are to the page, column and line number. 11 Two other words postdating the O.E.D. last entry are mandragon (mandrake), 663.a.37—last entry 1611; and wagleg (gadfly) 168.b.37—last entry 1611.

The risk in Folio texts is, indeed, that Jaggard's compositors might have developed a bias against the modesty of nature towards the recondite in vocabulary. 12 Grant White conj.

      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of the Second Quarto of Romeo and Juliet (1599) by Paul L. Cantrell and George Walton Williams *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE RECENT PUBLICATION OF TWO EDITIONS OF Romeo and Juliet and the appearance of supporting articles by the several editors have suggested the pertinence of an examination of the printing of the second quarto of the play. 1 This quarto, the 'good' quarto, was printed in 1599 by Thomas Creede and is generally thought to depend in some manner on a Shakespearean manuscript. It is therefore the text from which all subsequent editions derive. In this article the writers will investigate two aspects of the 1599 quarto: the composition and the copy. The first section will discuss the compositors and the press-work; the second will offer some observations on the nature of the copy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. The Composition 1. Compositor Determination . It has been assumed that the second quarto of Romeo and Juliet was set by one compositor, but this opinion is contraverted by several kinds of bibliographical evidence. Variant compositorial characteristics suggest the presence of two compositors, and the mechanical evidence of the press-work corroborates that suggestion. The evidence from typographical practices is of four kinds. The first concerns the setting of proper names in stage directions. In this quarto proper names in stage directions appear generally in distinguishing type (roman) on 35 signatures; for example: A4: Enter old Capulet in his gowne, and his wife . B4: Enter Capulets Wife and Nurse . 2 F2 v : Enter Mercutio, Benuolio, and men . I2: Enter Frier and Countie Paris. 3 However, on five signatures — A3 v , A4, K3 v , L4, and L4 v — proper names in non-distinguishing type (italic) occur as follows: A3 v : Enter Benuolio . A4: Enter Tibalt . K3 v : Enter Will Kemp . L4: Enter Romeos man . L4 v : Enter Capels. / Enter Capulet and his wife. / Enter Mountague . A second kind of evidence is found in the forms of certain speech prefixes. On pages L3 v and M1 appears the prefix " Frier " in that fully spelled-out form, eight times on L3 v and twice on M1. Only this form is found on these pages, but in the rest of the book " Frier " never occurs; instead, the prefix appears 43 times (including two catchwords 4 ) in the short form " Fri ." 5 In a similar manner the spelled-out form " Peter " occurs once on E3 and ten times on K3 v . The abbreviated form " Pet. " occurs on E4 (once), E4 v (once), and L2 (twice). On K3 v the speech prefixes " Minstrels " (1), " Minstrel " (1), and " Minst. " (5) appear seven times (once as a catchword); on K4 the form is " Min. " (1). Again, on K3 v occurs the prefix " Fidler " (1); on K3 the form is " Fid. " (1). 6 The short forms, " Fid. " on K3 and " Min. " on K4, are in marked contrast to the long forms on K3 v and bracket that page. Though other instances of fully spelled-out prefixes occur, no comparable concentration of these forms exists in the quarto. The third kind of evidence is provided by the catchword when it happens to be a speech prefix. On 25 pages in the quarto the catchword indicates the beginning of a new speech on the top of the following page. On 22 of these pages the form of the catchword consists of the speech prefix and the first word of the speech ( e.g. , K2 v Fri. Peace). 7 On two occasions the catchword consists of the prefix only: F2 v Mer. , K3 v Minst . On one occasion the catchword consists of the first word of the speech only: B1 v But. 8 The fourth kind of evidence is provided by the catchword when it is juxtaposed with a stage direction directly above it. This situation occurs thrice in the quarto. On I4 v and on K3 the stage direction and the catchword appear in contiguous lines; on K3 v the direction " Exit " is separated from the catchword " Minst. " by an intervening line of quads, though such an insertion results in a page of abnormal length (39 linear spaces). It will be noticed that on several pages the first three categories of evidence are conflicting. Thus on A4 there is one stage direction with proper names in italic type, three with names in roman; on E3 there is the long prefix " Peter " at the first appearance of the speaker, but there is also a catchword composed of a prefix and the first word of a speech; on F2 v there is a catchword composed of a prefix only, but there are also two stage directions containing proper names in roman type. And on A3 v , though there is no conflict, it is evident that the stage direction " Enter Benuolio .", by virtue of its unique position on a line of dialogue — not set off, constitutes a special case in the quarto. If we then confine ourselves here to those pages on which no conflicts occur, we may tabulate the clear evidence thus: The four kinds of typographical evidence combine to distinguish signature K3 v markedly and to connect that page with the seriatim group grouped and seem actually to indicate a second hand, we tentatively posit a second workman for these pages, Compositor B. To Compositor A we assign the greater portion of the work. Spelling tests will clarify the distinction further. Since it is on signature K3 v that the typographical evidence most strongly indicates the presence of a second compositor, we may look to that page first in an attempt to discover spelling differences that distinguish it from the other pages of the quarto. Two words, "dry" and "cry", appear at once to set K3 v off from the general pattern of the book and at the same time connect it with pages L4 and L4 v , already tentatively assigned to Compositor B on typographical evidence. dry-beate K3 v drie beate F3 v drie D4 v , G3, H3 v , K3 cry K3 v crie D1, E3, L4 v descry L4 outcry L4 v The use of the termination - y for these short forms is in marked contrast to the spellings in the rest of the quarto of these particular forms (as indicated in the list above) and of similar or related forms (as indicated in the list below): alie F4 defie L2 v denie C3, D2, D3, I2 v , K4 flie C1, G1, G4(2), L2 v prie L2 replie I1 spie F2 v , I3 trie I4(2) The instances of these endings point to a decided preference on the part of Compositor B for the - y spelling and an exclusive preference on the part of Compositor A for the - ie spelling of these short forms. 9 Since the evidence of this - y /-ie spelling difference confirms the evidence of the typographical practices on pages K3 v , L4, and L4 v , we feel confident in examining Compositor B's five pages together, including pages L3 v and M1 that share the same practices, for additional - y / -ie variations. A pattern similar to that for the short forms is found in the termination of nouns, verbs, and adjectives: K3 v merie, cary, mary, mercy, speedy L3 v vnthriftie, stony, goarie, guiltie L4 happy, bloudie, Countie, safetie L4 v County, emptie M1 Citie, Countie The proportion in these is ten - ie forms to seven - y forms. When this ration is applied to spelling on the pages of the rest of the book, it is seen that one page, L3, maintains the same proportion: L3: merie, bewtie, bloudie, enemie, Appothecarie, vnsauoury, weary, Appothecary. We therefore assign this page also to Compositor B on the ground of this spelling distinction. In these six pages there are then 15 - ie forms and 10 - y forms of the endings of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. On the other hand, with the exception of such words as "any", "many", "every", "ready", and "already", and such special cases as "Lady" and "body", Compositor A in the larger portion of the book sets nouns, verbs, and adjectives with terminal - ie almost exclusively. Of 270 instances of relevant forms on the 83 pages that we think were set by Compositor A, only twelve variants from the - ie spelling are noted: 10 A1 sundry, Burby C2 watry D2 liuery (liuerie, F3) E4 penny G4 vnworthy G4 v sympathy H4 v vnworthy, worthy I4 harlottry K4 v penury L1 hurry The distinction is even clearer in the use of adverbs and adjectives ending in - ly or - lie . Of the ten instances of these modifiers in the work of Compositor B, two adverbs on signature L4 end with - lie : "Happlie" and "newlie". Compositor A employs the - ly termination almost exclusively and, in contrast to the Compositor B forms, sets for example: "happily" H4, I2 v ; and "newly" A1, G1. In a passage in the second quarto demonstrably set from the first quarto (see below) Compositor A changes Q1 "louelie" and "liuelie" to his preferred forms "louely" and "liuely" B3 v . Of 136 instances of suitable forms on the pages of Compositor A, all occur with the - ly ending with three exceptions: "earlie" C2 v , C4 v (cf. "early" passim ); "solie" E3 (cf. "soly" E2 v , immediately preceding). 11 The evidence may be summed up thus: Compositor A Compositor B Short Forms Exclusive - ie Prefers - y Nouns, verbs, adjectives Much prefers - ie Indifferent Adverbs, adjectives in - ly Exclusive - ly Indifferent Though this single spelling variant serves generally to distinguish the work of the two compositors in this play, there are particular spellings on each of the six pages of Compositor B that contribute further to this distinction. Compositor B Compositor A K3 v merie (L3) merrie B3 v , B4 v , I3 v , (merie I4), K1 v cary carrie A3 yron (2) iron L1 v , L2 musique (4) musick (e) C3, D4, F1, F2, K1 v (2) mary marrie B4 v (2), C4, E1 v , H4 v , I2, I3 (2), I3 v , I4 L3 point poynt F4 v (2), G1, K1, K1 v merie (K3 v ) [ see above ] staie stay [ throughout ] dym dim I1 v L3 v Whoes whose G4 v Master maister [ throughout ] entents intents L2 (2), L4 yong young [ throughout ] 12 heere (L4, M1) here [ throughout ] hower (M1) houre [ throughout ] nest neast F1 v L4 poison poyson B3, E1, G2, G4, H4, K1, K4 v (2) L1 (3), L4, M1 Pittifull pitifull K3 heere (L3 v , M1) [ see above ] L4 v maners manner (s, ly) C2 v , C4, I3 v M1 foorth forth A2, A4 v , D4 v , G3 v (2), H1 v , I4 v , K2, L1, M1 v heere (L3 v , L4) [ see above ] Compositor B Compositor A mariage marriage D3 v , E1 v , F1, H1 v , I1 v , I2, K1, M1, M1 v stayed staid H1 v , L1 hower (L3 v ) [ see above ] One other characteristic may be mentioned, though deduced from negative evidence only. In Compositor A's pages the single - e form of the personal pronoun and the verb occur regularly, but the double - ee form appears twenty-one times; Compositor B's pages in this quarto contain only the single - e form: hee, shee, mee, wee, yee: B2(2), B2 v (2), B3, B4(2), C4 v , E2(2), E3 v (2), F2 v , F3 v , H2 v (2), I2 v , I4, L1 v / bee: B3, D3 v . It seems clear that the spelling evidence corroborates the typographical evidence in distinguishing the work of two compositors in Q2 Romeo and Juliet . 13 Signatures K3 v , L3 v , L4, L4 v , and M1, tentatively assigned to a second compositor on typographical evidence, may be confirmed by spelling evidence. To them signature L3 may be added on spelling evidence alone since the nature of the text here admits none of the typographical evidence (no stage directions, no speech prefixes, no prefix catchword). The three pages noted earlier on which there were conflicts of typographical evidence are confirmed by spelling evidence as not belonging to the second compositor, Compositor B, and the three conflicts in question may be attributed to chance or to the oversight of the principal compositor, Compositor A. 2. The Printing Process . The quarto is printed with two skeleton formes recurring in regular sequence throughout sheets B through K. 14 In these sheets one skeleton is used for the inner forme, the other skeleton for the outer; they alternate on the press seriatim. The two running titles for the inner forme of sheet A (I and II) are used in the outer forme in sheets B-K, and one of the titles (II) is also used in the outer forme of sheet A. The sequence of two alternating skeletons is consistent through sheet K, with the following exceptions: a turn of the inner skeleton at the imposition of sheet E and a turn back at sheet K; similarly a turn of the outer skeleton at sheet E and a turn back at the imposition of sheet G. The outer-forme running title I is replaced or reset in F (I'), and titles II and III seem to have been readjusted after loosening. After sheet K this sequence is observed: It will be noted that the outer forme of sheet L breaks the previously established pattern by utilizing the skeleton (here turned) that has been regularly working the inner forme and simultaneously discards the usual running title (VII) that has been used in the inner skeleton. The rejection of running title VII and the use of title II in the respective quarter of the outer forme of sheet L suggest that signature L4 v had been set complete with running title II and its furniture before the other three quarters of L outer were ready for imposition; and further, that title II was available for such imposition because it had previously been discarded from sheet M, which must therefore have been imposed before L outer. This evidence from running titles can be explained only with great difficulty as accompanying the work of one compositor; but a reasonable explanation may be offered by resorting to the hypothesis of a second press, and thus of a second compositor. The presence of the second compositor in sheet L, strongly suggested by the evidence already advanced, is then confirmed at the same point in the quarto by the evidence of the press-work. The compositorial and the mechanical evidence in conjunction leave little doubt as to the presence of a second compositor or the extent of his work. A conjectural time table may now be set up for sheets K, L, and M, indicating the pages set by the two compositors and the passage of the formes through the press. From this information we may visualize something of the situation in the shop. As Compositor A approached the end of page K3, Compositor B concluded his work on another job and became available to assist him. Compositor B accordingly set page K3 v while Compositor A set K4, in that manner making the inner forme of sheet K ready for the press at the earliest possible moment. (The inference is that Compositor A was near the end of K3, for had he been near the beginning of that page, Compositor B could have set K4 v and thus made ready first the outer rather than the inner forme. But perhaps this hypothesis is too nice.) After completing K3 v Compositor B proceeded to set the second half of sheet L and, while K inner was printing, took the skeleton generally used for the outer forme and imposed it around K outer for his press. His press then perfected sheet K. When Compositor A had finished setting signature L2, he imposed and sent to his press the pages for L inner (two set by each compositor) in the regular inner forme skeleton which had just been used for K inner. Meanwhile Compositor B set type through M1, but he imposed half-sheet M for his press to print in the skeleton from K outer that his press had just released. In making this imposition he removed running title II and the furniture for that page, not needed for sheet M, and fixed them around L4 v , which he had recently set and placed on the imposing stone. When Compositor A came to impose L outer in the skeleton that his press had been using for L inner, he found L4 v with a running title already in position. He therefore removed from his skeleton the now unneeded running title VII. Such a schedule should not be construed as exact, but it explains with some margin for error the time sequence of the order of the formes through the press. 15 It also confirms the presence of a second compositor in certain specific pages at the close of the quarto. One other curiosity of this quarto may be mentioned. It appears that Compositor A made a preliminary estimate of the length of his copy on the basis of 37 linear spaces to the page. 16 He was consistent in setting this number of lines from A3 v to H4 v with these exceptions: 36 spaces on B4, C4, and G2; 38 spaces on E2 v . At the beginning of Sheet I, Compositor A readjusted his practice so as to set 38 lines to the page, saving thereby an amount of space equal to 27 lines of text at the maximum. In sheets I and K he was faithful to his new count, varying only once by setting 37 spaces on page K2. Compositor B, as has been noted, set 39 lines on K3 v in order to separate the stage direction from the catchword. Copy was cast off after sheet K with some care so that Compositor B could set the second half of sheet L beginning with L3. Compositor A set 38 lines for L1 and L2 and 37 lines for L1 v and L2 v ; Compositor B set 39 lines for L3 (in order to begin L3 v with the stage direction) and 38 lines for L3 v , L4, and L4 v . The two full pages of sheet M are set 37 lines.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. The Nature of the Copy Perhaps the most important question to be solved in any textual study of Romeo and Juliet is that of the contamination of the second quarto by the first quarto. Though the first quarto is an inferior text — generally thought to be a memorial reconstruction — in at least one passage it served as copy for the second quarto. Critics differ on the precise limits of this reprinted passage, but roughly it extends from I.ii.52 to I.iii.35, some ninety lines. 17 There are also indications of further contamination elsewhere in the quarto, but these sections are in even greater dispute. The precise textual inter-relationship of the two quartos and of the authoritative manuscript behind Q2 has never been explained thoroughly and convincingly. One sort of evidence that has received only cursory attention is that derived from speech prefixes, yet such evidence offers additional information of some value that bears on the question. 18 We are fortunate in having in Romeo and Juliet the reprinted passage already mentioned in which all authorities agree that Q2 was set from Q1. From the 33 prefixes in these reprinted lines that we may regard as forming a "control passage," we may draw some conclusions as to the practice of Compositor A (who set this section) when he is following a known printed copy. 19 The prefixes are as follows: Q1 Q2 (variants only) Q1 Q2 1. Romeo 18. Ser 2. Ben 19. Ben 3. Romeo 20. R o 4. Ben 21. Ben 5. Rom 22. Rom Ro 6. Ser 23. VVife 7. Rom 24. Nurce Nurse 8. Ser 25. Iuliet 9. Rom 26. Nurce Nur 10. Seru Ser 27. Iul Iuli 11. Rom 28. VV Wife 12. Ser 29. Nurce Nurse 13. R o 30. VVife 14. Ser 31. Nnrce Nurse 15. R o 32. VVife 16. Ser 33. Nurce Nurse 17. R o In this group of 33 prefixes, nine in Q2 have been altered from their originals in Q1. (The purely typographical differences between Q1 VV /Q2 W and Q1 R/Q2 R are of no consequence.) Of these nine alterations, four are spelling changes, unimportant in this connection, "Nurce" to "Nurse" (#24, 29, 31, and 33; #31 involves a double change). The remaining five (#10, 22, 26, 27, and 28) constitute changes in length. But in spite of these five changes in length, the Q2 prefixes give the clear impression that the compositor is faithful to his copy. A profitable insight into the compositor's general practice is provided by an examination of these five variants; it will be found that all of the changes have been made to secure uniformity and consistency. Prefix # 10 . In the reprinted passage the prefix for the Servant appears seven times. On six occasions the Q2 compositor follows his copy in the spelling " Ser ." On the seventh occasion (#10) when Q1 has " Seru ", the Q2 compositor changes the spelling to " Ser ", thus following his copy faithfully and consistently but not slavishly. The change tells us only that " Ser " is the form preferred by the compositor in the interests of consistency, a fact which is readily apparent. It is therefore for our purposes a non-significant change. It represents only a normalization to a consistent practice. We may now apply the principle of consistency in the speech-prefix pattern for the Servant to the rest of the quarto. Outside of the reprinted passage the prefix for the Servant occurs eight times. On seven occasions the Q2 spelling is " Ser "; the single variant occurs on page B3 immediately before the reprinted passage and is spelled " Seru ." It thus appears that Compositor A's consistent spelling " Ser " in the reprinted passage is also his preferred spelling. To secure this spelling he has even altered his copy spelling on one occasion (#10). Fourteen times in the play out of fifteen " Ser " is used; the single aberrant form " Seru " may then reasonably require some explanation. There are four possible explanations for this single variant spelling on B3. The first is that this is a fortuitous spelling; yet we have not found that this compositor indulges in random setting of this prefix; on the contrary, he sets it in a strictly consistent form. The second is that this " Seru " is so set because it is the first appearance of this speaker; but this theory seems weak considering the commonness of the character and the fact that " Seru " is little better than " Ser " in representing "Seruant" (Compositor A is by no means consistent in spelling out speakers' names on their first entrances). The third possibility is that " Seru " is taken from the stage direction; but here the direction has " Clowne ", and this possibility is ruled out. The fourth possibility is that " Seru ", " Serua ", or " Seruant " stood in the copy and that the compositor is following such a spelling. This possibility we believe most readily explains the variant. But the form in Q1 at this point is " Ser ", and it does not seem likely from the compositor's observed practice that he would change his preferred spelling when he finds it in his copy to an unpreferred spelling. We conclude then that the copy at this point was not Q1. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that the speech of the Servant is too much altered to have been taken from Q1 and must have been set from some sort of manuscript source. We infer that the prefix was set from the same copy (I.ii.38). The example of the prefix for the Servant is a slight one, but it illustrates the principles of the investigation. To repeat: the change Q1 Seru / Q2 Ser (#10) in the reprinted passage is a non-significant change because it represents only the normalization to the preferred practice of Compositor A; the usage " Seru " on B3 is a significant usage because it represents a variant from the discovered practice. The hypothesis that " Seru " is present in the copy at this point and influences the compositor is confirmed by the general admission of critics that this speech is taken from manuscript and not from Q1. Prefix #28. The case of the prefixes for the Wife is similar. The compositor's preferred practice in the reprinted passage is the spelling "Wife." Accordingly he normalizes the Q1 " VV " to this consistent form. In the rest of the play the prefix occurs four times (we exclude for the moment all other titles to this part): twice set by Compositor A, and twice set by Compositor B on L4 v (the latter settings do not concern us here). Compositor A's settings are on signatures A4 where the form is "Wife" and on I1 where the form is " Wi ." The question is then raised, of six settings by Compositor A why is one irregular? We conclude as before that the Q2 compositor is following his copy, since we have not found that this compositor introduces innovations in speech-prefix form. As the first quarto has the prefix " Mo " at this point, we believe that the copy was not Q1 (III.v.176), for it seems unlikely that an editor or annotator of that quarto would have introduced the aberrant form into that text (which has some form of Mother in this scene) when preparing copy for the press. Furthermore, at this point in the text the two quartos are sufficiently near to have made the insertion of a transcribed slip unnecessary. Prefix #26. Of the five prefixes for the Nurse in the reprinted passage, this one is uniquely abbreviated to "Nur." It is therefore in the passage an aberrant, but in the entire book this form of the prefix ("Nur" or " Nur ") is overwhelmingly favored by the compositor (in 78 out of 93 uses). 20 This change is therefore non-significant; but variations from this norm should then be distinctive. Of the fifteen aberrant forms in the 93 occurrences of the prefix, ten are "Nurse" or " Nurse " and five are " Nurs ." Of the ten prefixes spelled out "Nurse", four are in the reprinted passage (#24, 29, 31, and 33) and six in the section immediately following (sigs. B4 v and C1). Since there are as many as ten of these spelled-out forms we can not positively say that they constitute an aberrant spelling, but we believe that they do represent an unpreferred spelling found in the original. 21 They seem to be, if not preferred, at least acceptable to the compositor. The five other spellings, " Nurs ", that occur on signatures C4 v and D1, do constitute significant variants. These variants occur in the following pattern: Q1 Q2 a. Nurse Nur b. Nurs e Nurs c. Nur Nurs d. Nur Nur e. Nur Nur f. Nur Nurs g. Nurse Nurs h. Nurse Nurs In this sequence of prefixes the five Q2 " Nurs " variants are represented in Q1 by three spelled-out forms "Nurse" (#b, g, h) and two short forms "Nur" (#c, f). Since both the Q1 forms are used elsewhere by the Q2 compositor there seems but one reasonable explanation why Q2 should have the innovation " Nurs " five times: the compositor is reacting in his characteristic manner to his copy, following it. We conclude therefore that in these lines the first quarto was not the copy for Q2 (I.v.114, 131, 138, 144, 145). 22 Prefix #22. Of the 170 prefixes for the part of Romeo, the form " Ro " is used 130 times; the form " Rom " is used 29 times 23 and the spelled-out " Romeo " 11 times. Since the two short forms are both common, we hesitate to draw any conclusions from them, but we must observe that there appears to be little correlation between the quartos in their use. 24 The use of the spelled-out form, however, seems to be significant. Of the eleven instances of the prefix " Romeo ", two occur in the reprinted passage, two occur on B1 at the first entrance of the speaker where Q1 has the same form (as does the manuscript [see below, footnote 27]), and the remaining seven occur on pages B1 v (2), B2, C1, C2 v , C3, and H3. Since at these seven points Q1 uses one of the Q2 compositor's preferred short forms, we conclude that the presence of the unpreferred form in Q2 is due to the influence of a copy other than Q1 (I.i.177, 191, 214; I.iv. 1, 95; I.v.42 [catchword]; III.v. 36). Prefix #27. The case for Juliet is very similar. There are 116 prefixes for her part in the section of the quarto set by Compositor A (three more — " Iuli " — in the stint of Compositor B). Of these 116 the preferred form " Iu " is used 95 times; the form " Iuli " is used 19 times and the spelled-out form " Iuliet " is used twice. The change (#27) from " Iul " to " Iuli " is non-significant; the prefix " Iul " is never used in Q2. The spelled-out form is a significant usage because it is an aberrant form. It appears first in the reprinted passage (#25) and again on B4 v . Since it is copied in its first appearance we conclude that it is copied also in its second, but as Q1 has here " Iul " the copy at this point cannot have been the first quarto (I.iii. 66). 25 From this examination of the practice of Compositor A in the reprinted passage the following observations seem valid: 1. Whereas Compositor A has his personal preferences in the spelling of speech prefixes, he is greatly influenced by his copy and follows it exactly 28 times out of 33 (discounting the minor c/s shift in the prefixes for the Nurse). 2. When Compositor A does vary from his copy he does so in order to normalize the Q1 form to his own preference. 3. Compositor A in these lines never introduces an innovation in the speech prefixes. And on the basis of these observations the following extensions to the rest of the play seem valid also: 4. When a speech-prefix spelling preferred by Compositor A occurs in Q1 and also in Q2, no conclusions can be drawn as to the nature of the copy, since there is not necessarily a relationship. 5. When an unpreferred speech-prefix spelling occurs in Q2 and the preferred or acceptable spelling is found in Q1, then the Q2 spelling must reflect a source other than Q1, since it cannot be accepted that Compositor A would change a preferred Q1 prefix to an unpreferred innovation. 6. When an unpreferred spelling occurs in Q2 and that spelling is found also in Q1, the presumption is that Q2 was following Q1 copy. This occurs so rarely, however, that it appears to be purely coincidental, and instead of confirming the assumption of Q1 copy rather weakens it. Since the speech-prefix patterns of Q1 and Q2 vary independently (except in the reprinted passage) throughout the whole of the quarto to a comparable degree, we are constrained to accept the theory of an independent authoritative manuscript as copy for the second quarto with, as Dr. Hosley has termed it, "compositor's consultation" of the first quarto. Our confidence in this theory is strengthened when we consider that nowhere in Q2 save in the reprinted passage is there a sequence of speech prefixes of any considerable length that has any significant correlation with the corresponding passage in Q1. Furthermore, we believe that Compositor A by his intelligent fidelity and consistency reveals himself as a reasonable craftsman by no means so stupid or slovenly as some of his critics would have him. These principles may be applied to the prefixes for the other characters of the play. Those for Benvolio offer interesting evidence. Of the 62 occurrences of this speaker, the form " Ben " is used 54 times; the aberrant forms " Benu ", " Benuo ", and " Benuol " are used respectively four, three, and one times. As most of these aberrants occur in the early speeches of the part, it may be argued that these variants indicate the compositor's attempts to find the form that suits him. But " Ben " is still used five times before signature B1 v , as many times as the other forms put together and is therefore from the beginning the preferred spelling. The sequence of Benvolio's first prefixes is as follows: Q1 Q2 a. [Omit] Benuo A3 v b. [Omit] Benuo A4 c. Benuo Ben A4 v d. Ben Benuo e. Ben Ben B1 Q1 Q2 f. [Omit] Ben B1 g. Ben Benu h. Benuo Benuol i. Ben Ben j. Ben Ben The first two Q2 prefixes, " Benuo " (#a, b), must derive from the manuscript since the first quarto lacks the lines. 26 So indeed must #d " Benuo ", for here Q1 has " Ben ", the preferred practice of the compositor of Q2 and already used by him once. In the light of these assignments, we submit that #c " Ben " is also from manuscript, since if the compositor had been following Q1 he would probably have set the then normal " Benuo " at this point. These four lines we therefore ascribe to manuscript copy (I.i.71, 75, 113, 125). " Benu " and " Benuol " (#g, h) are innovations; they do not occur in Q1 here which has " Ben " and " Benuo ", forms already set thrice by the Q2 compositor. 27 We conclude that these also derive from manuscript (I.i.162, 166). Two more uses of " Benu " on B1 v would not seem to have been set from the Q1 " Ben " which is the preferred spelling (I.i.189, 190), and the presence of " Benu " once again on C1 v (I.iv.33) where Q1 omits the speech indicates that it was a common spelling in the manuscript. Mercutio speaks 64 times. Of these occurrences the form " Mer " is used 59 times; 28 the aberrant form " Mercu " is used three times, and the aberrants " Horatio " and " M " once apiece. The three aberrant forms " Mercu " do not appear in the first quarto which has at these points the preferred spelling " Mer "; we conclude therefore that these three lines were set from manuscript (I.iv.13; II.iv.13; III.i.45). " Horatio " and " M " would seem to be special cases. 29 Paris speaks 23 times. Of the prefixes, thirteen occur in the preferred form " Par "; aberrant forms also used are " Pa " (7 times), " Paris " (2), and " Pari " (1). None of these variants appears at the corresponding point in Q1. We conclude therefore that these forms were found in a manuscript (I.ii.12; III.iv.8, 19, 29; IV.i.19, 21, 24, 32, 35; V.iii.49). The five settings of " Pa " on signature I2 v (IV.i) are singularly impressive, because Q1 has consistently here the preferred spelling " Par ." The name of the Friar in Q1 is spelled "Laurence" throughout the text, and in the brief scene with Friar John the prefix is abbreviated " Laur ." In Q2 the name is spelled "Lawrence" in the text, and the prefix is abbreviated " Law " in that scene. We believe that the spelling difference of the four prefixes is traceable to a manuscript source for the scene (V.ii.2, 13, 17, 23). Of Compositor A's five settings for Peter, four are abbreviated " Pet "; one is spelled out. The aberrant spelled-out form occurs on the first entrance of the speaker. It is omitted in Q1 and therefore must derive from manuscript (II.iv.111) (cf. note 33). Prefixes as seldom used as those for Mountague, Mountague's Wife, and for other less important characters can tell us nothing, unless as in the case of Sampson and Gregorie they indicate of necessity a source other than the first quarto. The prefixes for the Prince have no distinctive variants. Capulet's Wife has 44 speeches assigned to her in Compositor A's share of the quarto by this variety of prefixes: Capu. Wi (1), Ca. Wi (1), Wife (5), Wi (1), Old La (6), La (14), Mo (12), M (4). In the face of such diversity it would be rash to choose one spelling as a preferred spelling. What does appear from this haphazard diversity is that the compositor is following his copy with the same faithfulness that has been observed in the reprinted passage, for judging from his observed practices it is impossible to conceive of him as introducing these inconsistencies on his own initiative. Of the 32 times the various Q2 prefixes have possible sources in Q1, only four times is there demonstrable influence (in the reprinted passage) and twelve times is there only arguable influence where Q1 has " Moth " and Q2 " M " (H4 (2), H4 v , K2) or " Mo " (H4, I1 v , I4 v (4), K2 (2)). but sixteen times the possibility of influence is eliminated by a generic change in the prefix: Q1 Q2 Wife Old La B4 v (3), C1 Moth La H3 v (5), H4, H4 v , K1 v (2) Mo Wi I1 Mo Ca. Wi G1 M Capu. Wi F4 v We conclude that these sixteen instances indicate a manuscript source at these points (I.iii.63, 69, 77, 96; III.i.151, 181; III.v.65, 69, 70, 79, 81, 88, 140, 176; IV.iv.1, 11). On the basis of this evidence we can now assign a page of some importance, B4 v , immediately following the reprinted passage, as having been set from manuscript throughout. On this page there are five prefixes for Capulet's Wife, five for the Nurse, and two for Juliet. Of the five prefixes for the Wife, all spelled " Old La ", three diverge from the Q1 copy and two are not in Q1; all concur in pointing to a manuscript. These " Old La " prefixes occur on B4 v ; in the reprinted passage on B4 the character is regularly " Wife ". The coincidence of this change of prefix form with the end of the reprinted passage, a bibliographical not a textual point in the quarto, is almost mandatory evidence for a manuscript source resuming at this point. 30 The presence of this manuscript is demonstrated yet more convincingly by the evidence of the unique " Iuliet " in the center of the page, as already discussed. This manuscript seems still to be in use on page C1 at I.iii.96 at the prefix " Old La " and at line 100 at the speech prefix for the Servant, for Q2 here has " Ser " which cannot be a copy of Q1 " Clowne ." The manuscript continues to the end of the scene, supplying the final couplet omitted in Q1. 31 The character of Capulet has the same sort of variety in speech prefixes: Capu (11), Cap (5), Ca (16), 1. Capu (3), Capel (1), Fat (1), Fa (11). Again it is risky to pick a preferred spelling, but as before certain generic changes are conspicuous: Q1 Q2 Cap Fa I1 (4), K2 (2), K2 v Capo Fa I4 v (2) Amid a confusion of different spellings in both quartos (complicated by the presence of at least three compositors in Q1 who spell "Capulet" differently) 32 these generic variants indicate distinctly a manuscript source at these points (III.v. 161, 171, 174, 177; IV.ii.37, 39; IV.v.22, 25, 34). It is, further, at least surprising if Q1 had been copy for Q2 that the prefix " Capo ", which occurs fifteen times in Q1, and the spelling "Capolet", are not inadvertently copied once in Q2. Other equally valid though less clearly defined generic changes exist in the prefixes for the attendants in the play. There is no certain policy in setting these prefixes; in addition to " Ser " there are " Man ", " Boy ", " Pa [ ge ]", " Clowne ", " Peter ," and " Balt[hasar] " in unpredictable disorder. No system is apparent, but the following generic changes seem to be of the same type as those for Capulet and Capulet's wife: Q1 Q2 Boy Pa L1 v Clowne Ser C1 Balt Man K4(2) Ser Fel K1 v (2) and Apo Poti L1(2) Such changes do not appear to us to be the results of any compositorial action, and we attribute them to the influence of a manuscript at these points (I.iii.100; IV.iv.15, 18; V.i.17, 27, 75, 77; V.iii.10). The change of Q1 " Balt " to Q2 " Pet " (L2 (2)) is a substantive variant and erroneous, but we conceive the error to be the author's, and not an editor's, and assign the variants to manuscript influence (V.iii.40, 43). 33 Thus far in this paper we have examined the speech prefixes in the second quarto in order to determine the preferred spelling of Compositor A and to explain the variants from that preferred usage. No variant can be attributed to a source in the first quarto, and no positive links between the two quartos in speech prefixes outside of the reprinted passage have been found. The only possible exception to this situation exists in the case of Tybalt. The prefixes for Tybalt occur seventeen times in seven different forms. It seems to us unwise to attempt to draw any conclusions from such disparate evidence, yet if our method is applied to this character, we find the following variants from the preferred " Tib " (7 times) that do have corresponding forms in Q1: Q1 Q2 Ti Ti C4 Tyb Tyb F3(4) No preferred usage for the names of attendants has been noted, but these prefixes may represent copy influence: Q1 Q2 Balth Balth M1 v Boy Boy M1 v Two spelled-out "Romeo" prefixes on B1 are found in both quartos. It is conceivable to be sure that in these instances there is Q1 influence on Q2, but such a theory would be more acceptable if there were more than nine instances of the type. We prefer to regard these as coincidental; at best they can but serve to confirm the theory of compositor's consultation. Though there are doubtless exceptions to the theory of speechprefix practice here advanced, the principle involved seems to be sound. It seems furthermore to point quite clearly to an independent manuscript as copy for the second quarto. At least the validity of this proposition is sustained by the overwhelming number of variants that do not originate in Q1 when compared with that almost negligible number that may derive from it. On the basis of the evidence already presented, and on the observation of Compositor A's fidelity to known copy, we argue for the theory of the independent manuscript, for we doubt that an editor or an annotator of the first quarto engaged with any reasonable or consistent attention to his editing would have made such unimportant changes in the speech prefixes. It is not credible to us that an annotator would make the useless change of one form of a printed speech prefix to another form of the same prefix, or, in the case of the generic changes, that he would alter the Q1 consistent use of some form of Capulet to the Q2 Father, the Q1 consistent use of some form of Mother or Wife to the Q2 Old Lady, Lady, or Capulet's Wife. 34 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that outside of the reprinted passage on no occasion do aberrants from the compositor's established and preferred practice positively have their origins in Q1 copy. We must therefore conclude that in the lines indicated above, Compositor A of the second quarto was following a manuscript of independent authority for his copy and following it faithfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * A shortened form of Section II of this article was read before the Southeastern Renaissance Meeting at the University of South Carolina, April 21, 1956. 1 Richard Hosley, ed. Romeo and Juliet ( Yale Shakespeare , rev. ed., 1954); J. D. Wilson assisted by G. I. Duthie, ed. Romeo and Juliet ( New Cambridge Shakespeare , 1955). Hosley, "The Corrupting Influence of the Bad Quarto on the Received Text of Romeo and Juliet ," Shakespeare Quarterly , IV (1953), 11-33; "The 'Good Night, Good Night' Sequence in Romeo and Juliet ," SQ , V (1954), 96-98; Duthie, "The Text of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet ," SB , IV (1951-1952), 3-29. Wilson, "The New Way with Shakespeare's Texts. II. Recent Work on the Text of Romeo and Juliet ," Shakespeare Survey , VIII (1955), 81-99. 2 This example occurs in the passage of Q2 that admittedly was printed from Q1 (see below, Section II). The Q1 proper name is in italic; the Q2 change to roman is deliberate and significant. The same change is noted in the direction " Enter Iuliet" a few lines below in Q2. The compositor's forgetfulness accounts for the two extensions of his practice to other than proper names on G1 and K4, but these slips would seem to confirm the existence of the practice. 3 Pages having proper names in stage directions in roman type and therefore distinct from those with proper names in italic type are: A3, A4(3), B1, B2 v , B3, B4(2), C1, C2 v , D1(2), D4, E1, E2, E2 v , E4 v , F1 v , F2, F2 v (2), F3, F3 v , F4(2), F4 v (2), G1, G3 v , H2, H2 v , H4 v , I2, I2 v , I4(2), I4 v , K1 v , K4(2), L1, L1 v , L2. 4 We have included in these computations speech prefixes that are used as catchwords and have treated them here and in the last section without any distinction. 5 On signatures D4 v , E1(3), E1 v (4), E2 (2), F1 v , F2(3), G3 v (5), G4(3+c.w), G4 v (5), H1, H2, I2(2), I2 v (4), I3, I3 v , I4, K2 v (1+c.w.), K3(2). 6 Parallel to this pattern are the numbered forms for the second and third musicians on K3 v : 2 M , 2 M , 3 M ; on K4 the form is reversed: M 2. (Elsewhere the practice varies: A4 M Wife 2; C3 1 or 2 Capu [5 times]; but cf. L4 3 Watch .) Mr. Hosley observes in correspondence that "the ' Minst ' as catchword on K3 v argues copy homogeneous throughout the first line of K4, and therefore the ' Min ' is definitely Compositor A's preference. This seems to me to be a pretty nice point, for here you can see the two compositors working each his own will on the same speech heading in the copy." 7 On signatures A3, B1, C2 v , C3, C4 v , D2 v , E2 v , E3, E4, F4, G1 v , G2, G4, G4 v , H1 v , H3, H3 v , I3 v , I4 v , K2, K2 v , L1. 8 The unique aberrant catchword on B1 v would seem to offer no material evidence here. 9 For the words "die" and "lie" atypical treatment is observed: Compositor A has a marked (but not exclusive) preference for the - ie form; Compositor B is indifferent. Die: B2 v , B3 v , D1, F2, G1, G1 v , G3, H1 v , H2, H2 v , I2, I3, K1, K2, K2 v , L1, L2 v , L3(2), M1 v Dye: B3, I1 v , L4(2) Lie: A3 v , B1 v , C2(2), C2 v (2), D1, D1 v , G1, G1 v , I3 v (3), K1, K4 v , L3, L3 v , M2 Lye: E1 (spelling rhyme), L4, M1 v . 10 All these aberrants occur on pages that are assigned to Compositor A for typographical or orthographical reasons. For example: "watry" on C2 is balanced by four - ie forms and two - ie spellings of the short verb "lie." 11 That Compositor A is responsible for these spellings is indicated by the presence of others of his characteristics immediately before and after them. 12 Compositor A uses "young" throughout, but on E3 v and E4 he adopts the shorter form, "yong", to justify in obviously tight lines. His preferred spelling occurs within three lines of both aberrants. The implications of this word are interesting. The form "young trees" on L1 v is set by Compositor A and the form "yong trees" on L3 v by Compositor B for what is evidently their misreading of the manuscript "yeug trees." On the first appearance Q1 has the correct "Ew tree" and is therefore not serving as copy at that point. 13 The need of distinguishing and contrasting the work of two compositors has perforce limited the description of the two men here. It is evident that characteristics shared by both compositors are not apparent in such a study; on the other hand exclusive characteristics of one compositor may be equally invisible if there is no opportunity for the second compositor to exhibit his variant preference (this is particularly true when the stint of the second compositor is brief). A compositorial analysis is being made of the dramatic quartos from Creede's shop in the period 1593-1605, in the hope of identifying additional work of the compositors of Romeo and Juliet in prints from manuscript and in reprints. 14 These observations are based on examinations of the Kemble-Devonshire and the Gott exemplars at the Folger Shakespeare Library. 15 We are indebted to Dr. Fredson Bowers for suggesting this phase of the investigation. 16 The space described is that within the page-opening in the skeleton. The count of lines or spaces includes the text, direction lines, signature or catchword, and all medial blank lines but excludes the running title. 17 The disagreement concerns the earlier limit of the passage. See Mr. Hosley's article in this volume for a complete discussion. His reasons for advancing line 52 as the beginning of the reprinted passage appear to us as sound, and we accordingly accept that line as our starting point. 18 Dr. Philip Williams used this kind of evidence to demonstrate the dependence of the folio text of Troilus and Gressida on the quarto ("Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida : The Relationship of Quarto and Folio," SB , III [1950], 137-140). Both copy and original were available for his study, but, though we must posit an original now lost, the principles of the investigation are not dissimilar. 19 Lest it be thought that because of its having been set from the quarto (or for any reason) this passage has any peculiar pattern of prefixes that would invalidate conclusions drawn from it, we submit the list of prefixes from I.iv. 1-53. The pattern is astonishingly similar, mutatis mutandis . 20 As before we have included catchwords in our computations. All catchwords follow the compositor's regular practices. 21 The situation is complicated by the possibility that the compositor, having set "Nurse" in the reprinted passage, would continue to do so for a page or two. There is also the problem of the use of italic or roman type for the Nurse's speeches and the contrasting type for her prefixes. But cf. footnote 31. 22 We admit the vexing possibility that Q1 "Nurs e " may have influenced Q2 " Nurs " in I.v. 114, but we cannot believe that it is responsible also for the four succeeding uses. 23 " Kom " on K4 v we assume to be a foulcase " Rom " and we count it as such. 24 It is possible that the Q2 compositor took his indifference to the use of Ro/Rom from the pattern established by the compositors of sheets A-D of Q1. Cf. H. R. Hoppe, The Bad Quarto of Romeo and Juliet ( Cornell Studies in English , XXXVI, 1948), pp. 46-47. The correlation in the use of Ro/Rom prefixes before comparable speeches in the two quartos varies significantly: Q1 A-D Compositors Scene Comparable Speeches Correlation Ii 13 46% (I.ii 11 91%) I.iv 11 27% I.v 8 25% II.i 1 100% II.ii 22 73% II.iii 6 50% - Average per scene 58.8% Q1 E-K Compositors Scene Comparable Speeches Correlation II.iii 2 0% II.iv 22 14% II.vi 0 - III.i 9 22% III.iii 15 7% III.v 6 67% V.i 7 28% V.iii 6 33% - Average per scene 21.3% The 91% of the reprinted passage is well above percentiles of the other scenes (excepting the 100% of II.i that is computed on only one instance). The difference between the average correlations in sheets A-D and in sheets E-K of Q1 is explained by the indifference to Ro/ Rom of the first set of compositors in Q1 and by the virtually exclusive preference for " Rom " exhibited by the second set in Q1. The Q2 Ro/Rom ratio is consistent at 22% through the play; it does not reflect this marked change in Q1 at sheet E. The fact that the Q2 compositor is not swayed by the preference in Q1 E-K is a good indication that he is not using Q1 as copy. 25 The prefix " M " intruded into Juliet's speech on F1 (II.v.15) has no original in Q1 and must derive from a manuscript source. (Query: Is it a misreading of the letter "N." written at that line by a prompter or a scribe to warn of the approaching entrance of the Nurse?) 26 It is conceivable that the compositor derived the spelling from a glance at the first usage in Q1 ( Benuo #c), but how then explain his failure to follow Q1 when he reached that point? The stage direction in Q1, " Enter Beneuolio ", offers a spelling nowhere used in Q2 (I.i.64). 27 The presence of a manuscript at I.i.166 which is indicated by Q2 " Benuol " confirms our suggestion that the two spelled-out " Romeo " prefixes (ll. 166, 167) are from manuscript and not from Q1. 28 " Mar " on D1v we assume to be a foul-case " Mer " and we count it as such. 29 The use of " M " for " Mer (III.i. 80) is surely a sign of justification and ought have no weight given it as an indication of any source. Though "Horatio's" speech is generally assigned to Mercutio in modern texts there is no reason why Horatio should not be the name of one of the "fiue or sixe other Maskers." The prefix plainly shows a manuscript source, for it is not in Q1 (I.iv.23). 30 Mr. Thomas has observed this already: "Bibliographical Links between the First Two Quartos of Romeo and Juliet," RES , XXV (1949), 114 fn. 1. 31 Mr. Hosley has communicated to us privately the following textual evidence for assigning to signature B4 v a manuscript source: "The Q2 reading 'houre' at line 66 cannot be a compositor's error for the printed Q1 form 'honor', for the same error is repeated in the following line, and the coincidence of two such misprints in two lines is virtually impossible. Thus the Q2 error would in each case seem to result from the compositor's misreading of the form 'honor' written out in secretary hand." 32 Hoppe, pp. 46-56. 33 Though this discussion has been confined to the reactions of Compositor A only, the following generic changes in the stint of Compositor B seem to parallel those already mentioned: Q1 Q2 Ser Peter K3 v (9) Moth Wife L4 v We believe therefore that manuscript was the source here too (IV.v.106, 111, 113, 114, 117, 125, 135, 139, 141; V.iii.191). The same source would seem to lie behind the realizations of numbers only in Q1 to numbered watchmen and numbered minstrels in Q2 on K3 v , L4, L4 v . 34 The problem of the prefixes for the Capulets is extremely puzzling. McKerrow noted ("A Suggestion Regarding Shakespeare's Manuscripts," RES , XI [1935], 462 n) that in Q1 Capulet was indicated by prefixes of some form of that name, and in Q2 in the same manner except when he became "Father" when "he is engaged in talk with Juliet." Actually he is engaged in talk with Juliet only four times in the play. In III.v he addresses Juliet twice. In the first speech (1. 150) his prefix is " Ca "; in the second (1. 161) it is " Fa ." His other speeches in this scene are prefixed " Ca " (up to 1. 160) and " Fa " (after 1. 160); they are addressed to the Nurse and to his Wife. In IV.ii he addresses Juliet twice. The speeches (11. 16, 28) are prefixed " Ca " and " Cap ." His other speeches in this scene are prefixed by some form of " Cap " (up to 1. 36) and by " Fa " (after 1. 36); they are addressed to a Servant, the Nurse, and his Wife. In IV.v Juliet is thought to be dead, and Capulet's speeches prefixed " Fa " or " Fat " are addressed to the Nurse, his Wife, and the Friar. Of the twelve parental " Fa " prefixes in the play, only one precedes a speech to the daughter. The situation is worse for Capulet's Wife. In Q1 in sheet B she is " Wife ", a form that reappears in the reprinted passage in Q2, but in sheets E-K she is called by some form of Mother in her prefixes. We offer the suggestion that the change may be traceable to the change in the printing of the quarto at the beginning of sheet E. In Q2 no order can be observed. The changes of prefix form within I.iii ( Wife, Old Lady, Mother ) and III.v ( Lady, Mother, Lady, Wife, Mother ) cannot reasonably be explained textually, editorially, scribally, or compositorially. An examination of the dialogue reveals that when Capulet's Wife is talking to her daughter she appears under the prefixes Wife (1), Mother (9), ( Old ) Lady (12); to her husband under Wife (2), Lady (3), Mother (2); to the Nurse under Wife (3), ( Old ) Lady (3), and Mother (2); to Paris and the Prince as Lady (1) or Wife (2); and to her Servant under Mother (1). No conversational, personal, or associational relationships discoverable from the text can account for the inconsistencies of this array. It is not reasonable to suppose that an editor would have introduced these irregularities if he had been annotating Q1 for the copy-text; at the same time it is difficult to believe that confronted with the welter in Q1, such an editor would not have levelled the forms to a consistent pattern. We certainly are not disposed to believe that the compositor voluntarily introduced this confusion. We suggest again that these variant forms are evidence of an independent manuscript.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Quarto Copy for Q2 Romeo and Juliet by Richard Hosley</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I THE EDITOR OF ROMEO AND JULIET MUST CONSIDER three general questions regarding the nature and relationship of the two editions preserving collateral texts, the First Quarto of 1597 and the Second Quarto of 1599. 1 The first is the nature of the text printed in Q1. Happily this question is not an issue, for it is now generally agreed that the Q1 text represents a memorial reconstruction deriving ultimately from the promptbook version of Shakespeare's company. 2 The second is the nature of the manuscript authority behind Q2. This question is likewise not an issue, for it is also generally agreed that Q2 derives mainly from Shakespeare's "foul papers," from which the promptbook of Shakespeare's company had in turn been ultimately derived. 3 The third question is the nature and extent of Q1's influence upon the text of Q2 during the printing of that edition. In considering this "contamination" one must further distinguish between two problems. On the evidence of virtually complete agreement in text and of a number of "bibliographical links" between the two editions (such as the Q1-2 concurrence in italic type for the Nurse's speeches in I.iii and in prose turnovers at I.iii.4 and 14), critics agree that a section of Q2 on signatures B3-4 was printed with only inadvertent "substantive" alteration directly from signatures B3-4 v of Q1, possibly because a leaf was missing from the foul papers. 4 The "reprinted passage" is usually defined as extending through I.iii.35 in the Globe numbering, whereas its beginning has been variously located at I.ii.46, 54, and 58. (I shall suggest below that it probably begins at line 52.) In any case, no critic disputes the general proposition that a Q2 passage of some ninety lines was printed directly from Q1 without editorial alteration. The second (and major) problem is posed by a number of scattered bibliographical links between Q1 and Q2 beyond the limits of the reprinted passage in I.ii-iii. This "sporadic" contamination is also granted by all critics, although they disagree on the question of how it occurred. Broadly speaking, two hypotheses have been developed. The first, implicit in Sir Walter Greg's position since 1942 and adopted by the present writer in the revised Yale edition (1954), postulates compositor's consultation of an editorially unaltered exemplar of Q1 during the process of typesetting Q2 directly from Shakespeare's foul papers. 5 The second, proposed by Miss Greta Hjort in 1926 and adopted by Professors Dover Wilson and Duthie in the New Cambridge edition (1955), postulates an editor's annotation of an exemplar of Q1 by systematic reference to the foul papers (with the addition where necessary of occasional transcribed insert slips) so as to bring the text of the quarto into substantive agreement with that of Shakespeare's manuscript; and the consequent use of such an annotated First Quarto as sole copy for Q2. 6 Clearly it is of some interest to establish which of these two hypotheses is probably correct, for the editorial implications of annotated-quarto copy are quite different from those of compositor's consultation. For example, if the contamination of Q2 was effected by means of annotated-quarto copy, the case for a given Q2 reading (excepting both presumptive Q2 misprints of Q1 and Q2 readings that might have been derived from insert slips) would necessarily be strengthened rather than weakened by Q1 variance, for the inference would be that the Q2 editor noticed an erroneous Q1 reading, deleted it, and wrote into the quarto copy the correct reading, which he derived from the foul papers and which was accordingly transmitted to Q2. Thus a modern editor might not logically adopt a Q1 variant in a supposedly annotated section of the Q2 text, for the fact of Q2 variance from Q1 would guarantee error in the Q1 reading. The New Cambridge editors nevertheless adopt a number of such Q1 variants. 7 On the other hand, if the contamination of Q2 was effected by compositor's consultation of Q1, an editor might logically accept any Q1 variant from Q2 that he judged to be correct. (Since Q2, if set mainly from manuscript, would presumably contain its share of handwriting errors (in addition to compositor's memorial errors), the Q1 variant to a given Q2 "graphic" error (like that to a given Q2 memorial error) would stand a chance of preserving the authoritative reading.) Correspondingly, we should expect to find perhaps fewer residual "common errors" if the contamination of Q2 was effected by compositor's consultation than if by annotated-quarto copy, although an editor would of course be equally free to emend a suspected common error in the one case as in the other. Here it should be noticed that the New Cambridge editors detect and emend only four errors common to Q1 and Q2 apart from the three occurring in the reprinted passage. 8 By way of contrast, in the New Cambridge edition of Richard III (1954), a play supposedly set in the First Folio from annotated-quarto copy, Professor Wilson emends over sixty errors common to the Folio and First Quarto texts. To be sure, it must be initially conceded that, because of the inferential nature of most biblio-textual investigation, neither hypothesis is capable of positive demonstration. 9 However, the hypothesis of annotated-quarto copy requires the postulation of at least three improbable circumstances. According to Professor Wilson's article (full details are not given in the New Cambridge edition), the Q2 editor acted in the service of Thomas Creede, the printer of Q2, but since the foul papers were not fully available the work of annotation and transcription had to be done at the theater rather than in Creede's shop ( Shakespeare Survey , pp. 90, 96). Therefore Wilson's hypothesis is based on the following propositions. (1) The Lord Chamberlain's Men sold the text of Romeo and Juliet for publication but refused to provide a manuscript for use as printer's copy, even though the withheld manuscript was Shakespeare's foul papers and therefore of no theatrical value to the company. (2) When Creede's editor arrived at the theater to prepare copy for Q2, the Chamberlain's Men forced him to work from the foul papers although the company's promptbook should have been readily available to simplify his task. And (3) the Q2 editor took the trouble to prepare annotated-quarto copy when it would have been hardly more labor to make a full transcript of the foul papers, for in addition to annotated Q1 pages and insert slips attached thereto, about 75% of the "quarto" copy for Q2 would have consisted of "insert slips" transcribed from the foul papers and inserted between the leaves of the quarto. 10 Furthermore, the hypothesis of annotated-quarto copy is clearly incompatible with the evidence of the texts in Q1 and Q2. On the other hand, the hypothesis of compositor's consultation is simple, not improbable, and entirely compatible with that evidence. 11</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Let us suppose two editions, A and B, preserving collateral texts of the same play. A is known to have influenced the text of B during the course of its printing; and a lost manuscript, MS, is known to be the ultimate source of extensive variants in, and additions to, the text of B. The question enforces itself whether MS directly influenced the text of B during the course of its printing (that is to say, whether the compositor or compositors of B, in setting up type for that edition, had direct access to MS); or whether, on the other hand, MS influenced the text of B only indirectly through an editor's annotation of an exemplar of A (with the addition where necessary of transcribed insert slips) so as to bring the text of that edition into substantive agreement with the text of MS, followed by the compositor's use of such an annotated exemplar of A as sole copy for B. The direct influence of MS upon B (if it exists) can usually be demonstrated by the establishment of what I shall call a "manuscript link" between B and MS. For our special purposes this may be defined as a textual variant in B that is either erroneous or abnormal in relation to the work of the B compositor in question, the situation of variance between A and B fulfilling three conditions. 12 (1) The texts in A and B immediately before and/or after the corresponding textual readings must not vary so extensively that (in the case of printed copy for B) an insert slip transcribed from MS would have been necessary in order to bring the text of A into substantive agreement with that of MS. (2) The reading in A must be either correct or in a form normally preferred by the B compositor in question, so that it would not have invited alteration either by an editor annotating printed copy for B or by the B compositor in the process of setting type from A. And (3) the variant in B must in all probability not be a compositor's error in the process of transmitting the unaltered reading of A. I turn now to some examples of the sporadic contamination of Q2 by Q1 Romeo and Juliet in which manuscript links occur in conjunction with bibliographical links. One occurs at II.i.10-13, in the section of Q2 (signatures D1-1 v ) corresponding to Q1 signature C4 v . As Pollard and Dover Wilson pointed out in 1919, 13 Q1 and Q2 here concur in the celebrated reading " Abraham : Cupid " at line 13, the erroneous punctuation clearly constituting a bibliographical link between the two editions, for the odds against the coincidence of a colon's having stood in both Q1 and the foul papers are fairly high. (Probably the punctuation is the fossil remains of a colon in some such manuscript abbreviation in the Q1 copy as " A :", " Ab :", " Abr :", or—if the correct reading is " Adam "—" Ad :". 14 ) On the other hand, at line 10 occurs the erroneous Q2 variant "prouaunt", corresponding to Q1 "Pronounce". Here the texts of Q1 and Q2 do not vary so extensively that a transcribed insert slip would have been necessary in the case of annotated-quarto copy, and the Q1 reading is also unquestionably correct, so that it would not have required alteration by a Q2 editor. Moreover, the Q2 variant is evidently not a misprint of the Q1 reading but rather, as Greg pointed out in 1928, 15 a misreading of the handwritten form "pronounc" (or "pronounce"). It may be added that the Q2 compositor in question, Compositor A of the determination by Cantrell and Williams, 16 makes comparable errors in misreading "damnd" as "dimme" at III.ii.79 and "coniuration" as "commiration" at V.iii.68. The Q2 variant "prouaunt" therefore constitutes a manuscript link between that edition and the foul papers. Another example of sporadic contamination occurs at II.iv.41-45, in the section of Q2 (signature E2 v ) corresponding to Q1 signature E1 v . Here, as Pollard and Dover Wilson first pointed out, Q1 and Q2 concur in the use of contrasting italic type for five proper names (" Laura ", " Hellen ", " Hero ", " Thisbie ", and " Romeo ", lines 41-45), and of non-contrasting roman type for three: "Petrarch" (Q2 "Petrach", 40), "Dido" (43), and "Cleopatra" (43). The concurrence in exceptional roman type clearly constitutes a bibliographical link between the two editions, for it would be a next to impossible coincidence that Q2 Compositor A, whose normal practice is to set incidental proper names in contrasting italic type, should independently of Q1's influence have failed to prefer it for these three particular names out of eight. On the other hand, at line 45 occurs the Q2 variant " Bonieur ", corresponding to Q1 "bon iour". Neither an insert slip nor editorial alteration would here have been necessary in the case of annotated-quarto copy. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the Q2 variant resulted from error or deliberate alteration on the part of Q2 Compositor A in the process of transmitting the unaltered reading of Q1, for if it did we should have to defend four separate propositions regarding that compositor's work. (1) That the " e " of the Q2 reading is a misprint for " o " resulting from foul case or memorial lapse. (2) That the variation from non-contrasting roman to contrasting italic type resulted from alteration or error by Compositor A, who in the "text proper" of the reprinted passage of I.ii-iii nowhere innovates contrasting incidental type and, in one of the Nurse's speeches there set in italic type, faithfully follows Q1's non-contrasting italic type for the second word of the reading "Lammas Eue " at I.iii.17 and again at line 21. (3) That the variation from a lower- to an upper-case initial letter resulted from alteration or error by Compositor A, who in the reprinted passage innovates an emphasis capital only thrice (" Vncle " at I.ii.71, "Sun" at line 97, and " Girle " at I.iii.4). And (4) that the variation from divided to undivided form also resulted from alteration or error by Compositor A, who in the reprinted passage follows Q1's divided form of compound words in 15 out of 16 occurrences (the exception being " maidenhead " at I.iii.2). In view of Compositor A's demonstrable fidelity to his known quarto copy, this concatenation of exceptions to his normal practice (especially the variations in type and word-division) clearly argues against derivation of " Bonieur " from Q1. 17 It therefore seems probable that the Q2 reading resulted rather from an e : o misreading of the handwritten form " Boniour ", although it might conceivably also have resulted from the accurate transmission of an exceptional manuscript form involving a phonetic spelling. 18 Accordingly the Q2 variant " Bonieur " constitutes a manuscript link between that edition and the foul papers. Still another example of sporadic contamination occurs at III.v.31-36, in the section of Q2 (signature H3) corresponding to Q1 signature G3 v . Here, as Pollard and Dover Wilson also point out, Q1 and Q2 concur in emphasis capitals for "Larke" (line 31), "Toad" (31), and "Huntsvp" (Q2 "Huntsup", 34). The concurrence clearly constitutes a bibliographical link, especially in view of the Q1-2 concurrence in emphasis capitals for "Larke", "Discords", "Sharpes", "Larke", and "Diuision" in the immediately preceding lines 27-29 (at the foot of signature G3 in Q1). On the other hand, at line 36 occurs the Q2 variant " Romeo ", corresponding to the Q1 speech-heading " Rom ". As in other instances, neither an insert slip nor editorial alteration would here have been necessary in the case of annotated-quarto copy. Furthermore, the Q1 reading is in a form that is acceptable to Q2 Compositor A, who, as Messrs. Cantrell and Williams point out, uses it in 29 out of 170 occurrences on pages typeset by him; whereas the Q2 variant is in a form that is decidedly abnormal to the work of Compositor A, who uses it in only 11 out of 170 occurrences. (In the remaining 130 cases Compositor A uses the form " Ro ".) Moreover, Compositor A faithfully follows his quarto copy in setting up the abbreviated form " Rom " at I.ii.55, 60, 64, and 66 (where the unaltered lower half of Q1 signature B3 undeniably served as copy for Q2). Accordingly the Q2 variant " Romeo " constitutes a manuscript link between that edition and the foul papers. Thus it seems clear that Q1 signatures C4 v , E1 v , and G3 v influenced the text of Q2 at II.i.13, II.iv.40-43, and III.v.31-34. But it also seems clear that these Q1 signatures did not serve as annotated-quarto copy for Q2, for variants in Q2 at II.i.10, II.iv.45, and III.v.36 were apparently derived not from Q1 but directly from a manuscript that could not have been a transcribed insert slip. Such combined influence of quarto and manuscript copy on the text of Q2 could only have resulted from compositor's consultation of an exemplar of Q1 during the process of typesetting Q2 directly from the manuscript authority behind that edition. 19</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The problem remains of attempting to define the beginning of the "reprinted passage" in I.ii-iii (signatures B3-4 v in Q1, B3-4 in Q2). Gericke, Thomas, and Greg have suggested that Q1 probably began serving as copy for Q2 at I.ii.46, the present writer at line 54, and Professor Duthie at line 58. In the nature of the case definitive exactitude is perhaps impossible, for in the twilight zone between the point where the compositor (Compositor A) was probably following manuscript copy and the point where he was probably following quarto copy it is difficult to distinguish with any great certainty between "consultation" of Q1 and its use "as copy." It is nevertheless possible, I believe, to narrow the limits of the beginning of the reprinted passage to within the four lines from I.ii.50 to 53a inclusive, and there is, furthermore, some basis for the supposition that the compositor began using Q1 as copy for Q2 at I.ii.52. In the first few lines after the earliest possible beginning of the reprinted passage (I.ii.46), there are four "substantive" variants between the texts of the quartos, one in line 47 (Q1 "with", Q2 "by"), two in line 48 (Q1 "backward . . . with", Q2 "giddie . . . by"), and one in line 53a (Q2 "I pray thee", omitted from Q1). 20 Although none constitutes a manuscript link, these Q2 variants nevertheless betray the existence of manuscript authority extending through line 53a. There being no evidence of manuscript authority after that line, we may assume that the Q2 text beginning with line 53b was probably set up directly from Q1. (If a leaf was missing from the foul papers, line 53b is accordingly the earliest part of the text that might have stood at the head of such a leaf.) Therefore we may designate the beginning of line 53b as a probable later limit of the beginning of the reprinted passage. A probable earlier limit is suggested by variation between the quartos in such "accidental" features of the text proper as punctuation and spelling. 21 In the four lines between I.ii.46 and 49 inclusive, Q1 and Q2 vary six times in punctuation (twice in line 46, once in 47, once in 48, and twice in 49). For convenience of comparison this figure may be expressed as 150 punctuation-variants per hundred lines. On the other hand, in the eighty-two lines following line 49 (I.ii.50-I.iii.35 inclusive), the quartos vary 34 times in punctuation. This figure may be expressed as 42 punctuation-variants per hundred lines, or almost four (3.6) times less than in the four lines immediately preceding line 50. However, the drop in variation at line 50 is actually a good deal more pronounced than this figure would suggest, for in the sixteen lines following line 49 (I.ii.50-66 inclusive) the quartos vary in punctuation only four times (once each in lines 54, 55, 58-9, and 66), or 25 times per hundred lines. Accordingly, we may say that in the sixteen lines immediately following line 49 the variation in punctuation becomes six times less than in the four lines immediately preceding line 50. The compositor may well have been following the punctuation of Q1 from line 50 on; but in any case his failure to follow its punctuation before line 50 suggests the possibility that he was there working mainly from manuscript copy, either reproducing its variant punctuation or preferring his own. Therefore we may tentatively designate the beginning of line 50 as an earlier limit of the beginning of the reprinted passage. The inference from variation in punctuation is confirmed by variation in spelling between the quartos. In the seven lines between I.ii.46 and 52 inclusive, Q1 and Q2 vary 7 times in spelling (twice in line 47, once each in 48 and 49, twice in 51, and once in 52). This figure may be expressed as 100 spelling-variants per hundred lines. On the other hand, in the seventy-nine lines following line 52 (I.ii.53a-I.iii.35 inclusive) the quartos vary 45 times in spelling. This figure may be expressed as 57 spelling-variants per hundred lines, or about half as many as in the seven lines preceding line 53a. However, the drop in spelling-variation at line 53a is actually much greater than this figure would suggest, for in the thirteen lines following line 52 (I.ii.53a-66 inclusive) the quartos vary in spelling only once (in line 55), or almost eight times per hundred lines. Accordingly, we may say that in the thirteen lines immediately following line 52 the variation in spelling between Q1 and Q2 becomes over twelve times less than in the seven lines immediately preceding line 53a. The compositor may well have been following the spelling of Q1 from line 53a on; but in any case his failure to follow its spelling before line 53a suggests the possibility that he was there working mainly from manuscript copy, either reproducing its variant spelling or preferring his own. Because of other evidence presently to be considered I do not believe that the evidence of spelling necessarily enforces a shift of the earlier limit of the reprinted passage to the beginning of line 53a. However that may be, the evidence of spelling supports that of punctuation in suggesting manuscript copy before line 50; and accordingly we may designate the beginning of that line as a probable earlier limit of the beginning of the reprinted passage. Within the probable earlier and later limits of the beginning of the reprinted passage (I.ii.50-53a inclusive) two further kinds of evidence require attention. One is textual variance, specifically the Q2 reading "I pray thee" (omitted from Q1) at line 53a. The other is contamination, specifically two bibliographical links between the quartos at line 52. One of these, as Professor Wilson suggests, 22 consists of the Q1-2 concurrence in the unabbreviated form of Romeo's speech-heading, this being an abnormal form for Q2 Compositor A; the other consists of the common emphasis capital of the textual reading "Planton" (Q2 "Plantan"), this being the only emphasis capital on Q2 signature B3. (These bibliographical links afford the earliest demonstrable evidence of contamination in the reprinted passage; they are followed almost immediately by a third, concurrence of the quartos in another unabbreviated speech-heading for Romeo at line 53b.) The problem, of course, is to resolve the fact of manuscript influence in line 53a with the fact of contamination in line 52. If we exclude annotation as a logical improbability (since Shakespeare's foul papers were in the hands of the compositor), there are two ways of interpreting this rather contradictory evidence. We may suppose, first, that the compositor followed his manuscript copy through line 53a, thus deriving the textual variant at that point directly from manuscript copy and earlier deriving from Q1 the unabbreviated speech-heading and the emphasis capital of line 52. Following this line of argument we might designate I.ii.53b as the probable beginning of the reprinted passage. Or we may suppose, alternatively, that the compositor shifted from manuscript to quarto copy at some point after line 49 but before line 52, thus deriving the bibliographical links of line 52 directly from Q1 and subsequently glancing back at his only-just-discarded manuscript copy for the textual variant of line 53a. Initially this hypothesis may appear unacceptable through its assumption that after having shifted to quarto copy the compositor would reverse his usual procedure and consult manuscript copy. However, if we think of the compositor as working mainly from "principal" copy (usually manuscript) and intermittently consulting "auxiliary" copy (usually quarto), we may also, conversely, imagine him as working for a few lines mainly from quarto copy and occasionally consulting manuscript copy. Moreover, if a leaf was missing from the foul papers, a certain amount of overlap of manuscript and quarto influence on the text of Q2 would perhaps be inevitable as the compositor approached the end of his manuscript copy and sought to ascertain the exact point in Q1 where the manuscript would leave off (it being assumed that this point had not been clearly marked in the quarto copy). In any case, a prominent characteristic of the compositor's work elsewhere in Q2 suggests the probability of the second procedure. As Messrs. Cantrell and Williams point out, it is a significant fact that except in the reprinted passage the speech-headings of Q2 are almost invariably independent of those in Q1, for Compositor A (who set all but six pages of Q2), although he intermittently consulted auxiliary copy (Q1) in the matter of "text proper," appears generally to have followed the speech-headings of his principal copy (the foul papers). Therefore it seems unlikely (although it is of course not impossible) that he would here have consulted Q1 (auxiliary copy) for a speech-heading if he had still been working mainly from manuscript (principal copy). Thus it follows that when he derived Romeo's unabbreviated speech-heading from Q1 at line 52 he had probably already substituted Q1 for the foul papers as his "principal" copy. (After I.ii.53a Q1 must have been his sole copy until the end of I.iii.35, where he apparently returned to working mainly from the foul papers.) Accordingly, we may advance the probable later limit of the reprinted passage to the beginning of line 52. Within the narrower limits of the two lines between I.ii.49 and 52 there are two variations in spelling between the quartos (both in line 51). Since these suggest minimal influence of manuscript copy, we may designate the beginning of line 52 (despite the single spelling-variant of that line, apparently the compositor's normalization of an aberrant copy-spelling 23 ) as the probable beginning of the reprinted passage. The evidence adduced to the preceding argument is summed up in the following table, which locates the occurrences (between I.ii.46 and 66 inclusive) of each textual phenomenon discussed and gives (where appropriate) the total of occurrences in each line:</field>

In The Shakespeare First Folio Greg writes (p. 231) that in addition to the reprinted passage "there are others in which Q1 was at least consulted by the printer of Q2, presumably owing to the occasional obscurity of the manuscript." 6 Greta Hjort, "The Good and Bad Quartos of Romeo and Juliet ," MLR , XXI (1926), 141-142; G. I. Duthie, "The Text of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet ," Studies in Bibliography , IV (1951-52), 3-29; J. Dover Wilson, "Recent Work on the Text of Romeo and Juliet ," Shakespeare Survey , 8 (1955), 81-99; Duthie and Dover Wilson, Romeo and Juliet (1955), pp. 113-115. In Principles of Emendation in Shakespeare (1928), p. 20, Greg suggested that the first two sheets of Q1 had been corrected and used as copy for Q2. 7 Possibly because they attempted for some months to work from the position that Q2 was mostly printed from the foul papers (p. 114). A few examples are discussed in section II below. In defense of their adoption of Q1 "name" in place of Q2 "word" at II.ii.44, the editors argue (p. 155) that the Q2 editor, in collating his exemplar of Q1 with the foul papers, must have misread the correct reading of the foul papers and then substituted his misreading for the correct reading of the quarto copy. However, the weakness of this proposition becomes evident when we recall that the Q2 editor would have had to mistake a given manuscript reading despite the concurring evidence of Q1 . For such an editor would not be in the position of a compositor spelling out manuscript copy unaided; rather, he would be comparing his manuscript with a printed text. He would have (in effect) one finger on the printed quarto reading, another on the corresponding manuscript reading; and he would glance back and forth from one reading to the other. For example, to conform to the New Cambridge hypothesis he would come upon "coniuration" in the foul papers at V.iii.68. The ductus litterarum would make possible the misreading "commiration". The Q2 editor would then glance at his First Quarto, where the reading appeared correctly (although in plural form) as "coniurations". But this (the editor would feel) could not be right, and anyway the manuscript reading would still appear to him to be "commiration". Therefore (an insert slip being here unnecessary) he would substitute the nonsense word "commiration" for "coniurations" in the quarto copy. Such a train of events is unnecessarily complicated and presupposes perhaps excessive "stupidity" on the part of the Q2 editor. 8 In the reprinted passage: (1) Q1-2 "Anselme", a common error for "Anselmo" at I.ii.68; (2) "Vtruuio" for "Vitruuio" at I.ii.69; and (3) "fire" (Q2 "fier") for "fires" at I.ii.94. Beyond the limits of the reprinted passage: (4) "sinne" (Q2 "sin") for "pain" at I.v.96 (although Q1 signature C3 v is not among those supposed by the New Cambridge editors to have served as annotated-quarto copy for Q2); (5) omitted speech-headings for the Friar and the Nurse at III.iii.85b and 86b, so that lines 85b-86a ("O wofull simpathy: / Pitious prediccament") are continued to the Nurse; the New Cambridge editors supply the missing speech-headings, so as to assign lines 85b-86a to the Friar; (6) "change" for "changd" or "changed" at III.v.31; (7) "Death" for "Dead" at V.iii.87. 9 For example, Professor Wilson's Shakespeare Survey article does not demonstrate the hypothesis of annotated-quarto copy; it merely demonstrates that Q1 occasionally influenced the text of Q2 during the printing of that edition. 10 The New Cambridge editors suppose that only 33 of Q1's 75 printed pages served as annotated-quarto copy for Q2 (D4-4 v are listed only in the notes to the edition, F4 v only in Professor Wilson's article); and the text of Q2 (3,007 lines in Chambers's count) is over a third again longer than that of Q1 (2,232 lines). Other difficulties connected with the hypothesis of annotated-quarto copy are commented on by the editors (p. 115; compare Shakespeare Survey , p. 96). 11 Compositor's consultation of a printed text seems also to have occurred during the typesetting from manuscript of the Second Quarto of Hamlet (1604-5); see Fredson Bowers, "The Textual Relation of Q2 to Q1 Hamlet ," Studies in Bibliography , VIII (1956), 39-66. 12 In seeking to establish a bibliographical link between A and B, the critic is in possession of all the evidence (the readings of the two editions), whereas in seeking to establish a manuscript link he lacks the evidence of MS. That is to say, the case for a bibliographical link involves an inference (based on concurrent readings preserved in A and B) concerning the relationship of an extant reading in B to an extant reading in A, whereas the case for a manuscript link involves an inference (based on variant readings preserved in A and B) concerning the relationship of an extant reading in B to a lost reading in MS. Hence in the nature of things a manuscript link will usually be less readily demonstrable than a bibliographical link. 13 A. W. Pollard and J. Dover Wilson, "The 'Stolne and Surreptitious' Shakespearian Texts: Romeo and Juliet , 1597," TLS , August 14, 1919, p. 434. The authors advanced the hypothesis (since withdrawn) that this and other concurrences between Q1 and Q2 resulted from a common manuscript source for the two editions. 14 For this suggestion, as well as for much valuable criticism, I am indebted to Professor Fredson Bowers. 15 Principles of Emendation , p. 22. 16 Paul L. Cantrell and George Walton Williams, "The Printing of the Second Quarto of Romeo and Juliet (1599)," Studies in Bibliography , IX (1957). Compositor A typeset all pages of Q2 except K3 v , L3-3 v , L4-4 v , and M1, which were set by Compositor B. I am indebted to the authors for permitting me to make use of their article in typescript, and I am especially grateful to Mr. Williams for helpful criticism of my own article. 17 The possibility that Q2 Compositor A, in transmitting Q1 "bon iour", might have altered the reading to a single capitalized word in italic type (" Boniour ", misprinted " Bonieur ") because in ignorance of French he misinterpreted it as a name applied to Romeo is an extremely remote one, for the Q1 reading is evidently not a name; but in any case the possibility is ruled out by the fact that Compositor A introduced a comma between the name and the salutation, there being no punctuation in Q1 at this point. 18 The O.E.D. (under an entry for Middle English "iour") cites only the ou -spelling of "jour" and fails to record an eu -spelling of "journal" or "journey". Elsewhere in Shakespeare the word "jour" occurs in Titus Andronicus , I.i.494, First Quarto "bon iour"; in Henry V , IV.v.2, Folio " le iour "; and in As You Like It , I.ii.104, Folio " Boon-iour ". 19 In my edition (pp. 161-162) I have attempted to visualize the compositor's procedure in consulting Q1. I now feel that in parts of Q2 the consultation must have been somewhat steadier (that is to say, less "occasional") than I there suggested, although in several cases the compositor nevertheless failed to consult Q1 within a line or two of a point where his misreading of manuscript copy clearly indicates that he should have consulted Q1. It may be further observed that from time to time Compositor A seems to have consulted Q1 as he began setting a new page of type, for the influence of Q1 is occasionally apparent at the head of a Q2 page but notably lacking at the foot of the preceding page. For example, Q1-2 " Abraham : Cupid " occurs in the first line of Q2 signature D1v, whereas Q2 "prouaunt" and "day" (Q1 "Pronounce" and "Doue") occur in the third line from the bottom of D1. Again, Q1-2 "Passado", "Punto", "Hay", and "Poxe" (Q2 "Pox") occur in the first four lines of Q2 signature E2v, whereas Q2 "Prince of Cats", "Complements", and "dualist a dualist" (Q1 "prince of cattes", "complements", and "Duellist a Duellist") occur in the last five lines of E2. And Q1-2 "Tut" (in what I take to be the common error of "Tut . . . lost" for "But . . . left") occurs in the first line of Q2 signature B2, whereas "But" (the Q2 catchword for this reading) occurs at the foot of B1v. 20 Between I.ii.53b and I.iii.35 inclusive the quartos vary in six additional substantive readings. Three of the Q2 variants belong to the class of error we normally expect to find in a reprint and therefore probably result from Compositor A's errors of transmission in reproducing the text of Q1: his omission of Q1 " and " at I.ii.72, his substitution of "you" for Q1 "thee" at line 81, and his misprint of Q1 " shall " as " stal " at I.iii.17. Two are apparently the compositor's corrections of obvious errors in Q1: his emendation of Q1 " a " to " an " before " houre " at I.iii.11 and his interpolation of " the " (omitted from Q1) before " Dugge " at line 32. The last variant, Q2 " yeares " for Q1 " yeare " at I.iii.35, occurs at the very end of the reprinted passage and may, accordingly, be explained as probably resulting from the compositor's return to manuscript copy at that point. 21 The terms "substantive" and "accidental" are here used in the senses suggested by Sir Walter Greg, "The Rationale of Copy-Text," Studies in Bibliography , III (1950-51), 21-22. In counting punctuation-variants I have considered only stops (commas, colons, periods, interrogation points). Line-counts refer to lines of type in Q2. 22 Shakespeare Survey , p. 83. It should be pointed out that Professor Wilson has inadvertently cited more evidence than actually exists: the speech-headings common to Q1 and Q2 at I.ii.46-58 do not run " Ben ", " Romeo ", " Ben ", " Romeo ", " Ben ", " Romeo ", " Ben ", " Rom "; but " Ben ", " Romeo ", " Ben ", " Romeo ", " Ben ", " Rom ". 23 "Plantan" is the normal 16th- and 17th-century spelling. Since in the late 16th century the unstressed vowel had already been reduced to [ß] or [I] (see Helge Kökeritz, Shakespeare's Pronunciation , 1953, pp. 255 ff.), the contemporary spellings "planten" and "plantin" are fairly common, and the spelling "planton" is also possible although unrecorded by the O.E.D. Hence the o : a variation at I.ii.52 of Q2 "Plantan" from Q1 "Planton" may be regarded as Compositor A's normalization of an aberrant spelling in his quarto copy.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Shares of Fletcher and His Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon (II) by Cyrus Hoy *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ELEVEN PLAYS WHICH REPRESENT THE JOINT work of Fletcher and Massinger are of two distinct sorts: (1) direct collaborations between the two dramatists, and (2) revisions by Massinger of plays originally of Fletcher's sole authorship. The linguistic patterns of the two dramatists emerge distinctly enough in such of the collaborated plays as have not been reworked by the one or the other, and have been transmitted in texts which have preserved the colloquial and contracted forms of each. Elsewhere the linguistic evidence, particularly that of the Fletcherian ye , has been rather badly obscured. Since the linguistic patterns of Fletcher and Massinger comprise essentially opposing language preferences, a collaboration of the two should ideally produce a play in which the Fletcherian pattern, with its ye 's, ' em 's, i'th 's, and whatever, will alternate in individual acts and scenes with a pattern from which these forms are, for the most part, absent, but which will tend to show some increase in the use of the verb form hath . This is collaboration in its simplest form—the form in which the respective shares of the dramatists concerned can be most readily determined—and it obtains in four of the plays considered in this section of the present study: Barnavelt, The False One, The Prophetess , and The Spanish Curate . But even with collaboration on a scale as obvious as this, the printed text of the play in question must reproduce the linguistic preferences of the participating dramatists, if such preferences are to serve as the criteria for attribution. The four plays just named are extant in texts in which the linguistic patterns of Fletcher and Massinger have been preserved with scrupulous care. One, Barnavelt, exists in a manuscript that is known to be the work of the scribe Ralph Crane. The care that Crane exercised in reproducing the Fletcherian ye has been already observed, 1 and it is probable that the printed texts for the other three plays derive from Crane transcripts. Such a play as The Custom of the Country , however, makes clear the extent to which the linguistic texture of a play can be altered by a scribe who has made no great effort to reproduce the language forms present in his copy. If the distinction between the linguistic patterns of Fletcher and Massinger were maintained throughout the play as clearly as they are in the third act, the respective shares of the two collaborators would be demonstrable enough, and the play could take its place with those in the Barnavelt-Spanish Curate group. In its other four acts, however, the occurrence of ye seems to have been greatly reduced, if one is to judge by the frequency of its appearance in the Fletcherian scenes of Act III. Since the form is present there at something approaching its usual Fletcherian rate of usage, I can see no reason for supposing a compositor to have suppressed the form elsewhere in the play and not there; since no evidence exists of a Massinger revision, I can only conclude that the manuscript behind The Custom of the Country incorporated a portion of the author's autograph in which ye was present, but for the rest represents the work of a scribe who has given ye scant heed. The matter is discussed more fully below. The nature of any collaboration among two or more dramatists becomes more complex when some one of the participating authors tends to give the final form to the finished play. Apart from any literary revision that may be made, the dramatist who is reworking the whole generally avails himself of the opportunity of eliminating some of the more egregious linguistic preferences from the share of his collaborator, often introducing certain of his own. Of the Fletcher-Massinger collaborations, two, The Double Marriage and The Little French Lawyer , have apparently received their final form from Massinger, for Fletcher's ye has all but disappeared. The final version of The Sea Voyage is evidently the work of Fletcher; there ye is to be found in scenes that bear some of Massinger's strongest verbal characteristics. The Lovers' Progress and A Very Woman are, beyond hardly any doubt, Massinger revisions of Fletcherian originals, and The Elder Brother seems to belong in the same category. The extent of the revisions varies with each play. Massinger seems to have revised only the first and last acts of The Elder Brother , though the revisions here are so thorough as to amount to rewriting. They are equally thorough, and more extensive still, in The Lovers' Progress and A Very Woman . The scenes most completely reworked are heavily stamped with Massinger's favorite turns of phrase and grammatical constructions. Here, in the great number of cases, all occurrences of ye have been completely eliminated, and though scenes remain in all three plays which can almost certainly be regarded as pure Fletcher, the occurrence of ye in these seems suspiciously low. Certainly, Fletcher's excessive use of the form must have made it fair game for any dramatist who set about revising a play in which his work was present; and in removing it to the extent that he apparently did, Massinger was not being nearly so dogmatic as Fletcher's former collaborator, Beaumont, who, as we shall see, would only infrequently tolerate ye in any play for which he prepared final copy. From a purely literary and stylistic point of view, one can only applaud Beaumont and Massinger for pruning away a particle of grammar which, as Fletcher employs it, can become almost unbelievably tiresome. But for the sake of the present study, one could wish that they hadn't. Barnavelt Fletcher: I, 3: II, 2-6; III, 1, 3-4; IV, 1-3; V, 1b (from exit of Ambassadors to exit of Provost), 2-3. Massinger: I, 1-2; II, 1; III, 2, 5-6; IV, 4-5; V, 1a (to exit of Ambassadors), 1c (from exit of Provost to end). The play was never printed, and is extant only in a manuscript prompt-book prepared by the scribe Ralph Crane. Crane's care in reproducing the Fletcherian ye has been noted in connection with his transcript of Fletcher's Demetrius and Enanthe ( The Humourous Lieutenant ), and his regard for the colloquial and contracted forms employed by his authors is equally apparent here; no where are the linguistic patterns of Fletcher and Massinger more sharply differentiated within the same play than in Crane's manuscript of Barnavelt. Ye pervades the scenes of Fletcher's authorship (where it occurs a total of 132 times), but is found only twice in Massinger's portion of the play. Massinger's share exhibits 16 instances of hath , Fletcher's but one. Whereas the contraction 'em occurs 42 times in scenes by Fletcher, as against 6 occurrences of the expanded them , Massinger's scenes show a reverse preference, with only 3 instances of 'em and 33 of them . All instances of the contractions i'th' (6), o'th' (3) and' s for his (1) occur in scenes by Fletcher. The play's 5 occurrences of t' , the 2 occurrences of i'the , and the single use of the contraction of't are to be found in Massinger's portion of the play. 2 The Custom of the Country Fletcher: I; III, 1-3; IV, 3-5; V, 5a (to entrance of Hypollita). Massinger: II; III, 4-5; IV, 1-2; V, 1-4, 5b (from entrance of Hypollita to end). That the play is a Fletcher-Massinger collaboration is certain, and the respective shares of their authorship are clear enough. Ye , which occurs a total of 78 times in the scenes assigned to Fletcher, appears but twice in Massinger's portion. Hath , which is found 4 times in the Fletcherian scenes, appears 7 times in scenes by Massinger. Again, the occurrence of the contraction 'em and the expanded them in the two shares is striking. 'Em appears 25 times in the Fletcherian portion, while them appears but once. In the scenes by Massinger, 'em occurs only 3 times, while them is used 22 times. But while the evidence for the two dramatists is sufficiently distinct as to make no real difficulty in determining the work of each, there is hardly any doubt that the linguistic texture of the play has been to some extent distorted in the extant text. The wholly Fletcherian first act contains but 7 ye 's, an uncommonly low number when it is compared with the normal rate of occurrence of the form in single acts of his unaided plays, or the single acts of his authorship in such collaborated works as The False One or The Spanish Curate . It is only in the Fletcherian scenes of Act III that ye appears in any abundance; scene one alone contains 7 ye 's, so equaling the total for Act I. Such stage directions as "Boy ready for the Songs" (4a) * "Tapers ready" (8a), "Light ready" (8b), and "Hold a purse ready" (9b) make it clear that the first folio text derives from a theatrical prompt-book. It is likely that the scribe who prepared this failed in his transcript to reproduce ye on every occasion when it stood in his copy. It is probably significant that the third act, the only one in which ye does occur at something approaching the usual Fletcherian usage, is also the only act in the play that is divided into scenes. A possible explanation of this anomaly—if it is one—is that the prompt copy incorporated, as the text for Act III, a portion of the original Fletcher-Massinger manuscript in which the scenes had been indicated. Such a conjecture demands the further one that the prompt-book as a whole was prepared by some such scribe as Edward Knight, whose tendency to reduce the occurrence of the Fletcherian ye has been observed in his manuscript of Bonduca , 3 and whose tendency to ignore scene divisions can be demonstrated. Neither Knight's transcript of Bonduca , nor the prompt-book which he prepared for The Honest Man's Fortune contains scene divisions, as does such a prompt-book as the one Crane prepared for Barnavelt . In preparing Massinger's autograph manuscript of Believe as you List for use as a prompt-book, Knight regularly deleted the scene divisions which the author had carefully supplied. In the case of The Custom of the Country , it seems valid to assume that Act III, with its division into scenes and its preservation of the Fletcherian ye in the scenes of his authorship, and Acts I, II, IV, and V, with their lack of scene divisions and the paucity of ye 's in the Fletcherian portions, derive from two different manuscript sources. The Double Marriage Fletcher: II; III, 2-3; IV, 1, 3-4; V, 1-2. Massinger: I; III, 1; IV, 2; V, 3-4. Though the occurrence of ye seems here to have been rather sharply curtailed, its distribution is such as to afford a reasonably clear indication of the Fletcherian scenes. Further, the play provides additional linguistic criteria which corroborate the attributions made on the basis of ye . The form occurs 37 times in scenes assigned to Fletcher, twice in scenes by Massinger. Hath appears but once in Fletcher's share, 11 times in Massinger's. The occurence of 'em and them is significant. 'Em is found 44 times, to 5 instances of them , in the Fletcherian portion. In Massinger's scenes, the preference is reversed: 'em occurs but 6 times, them 14 times. While the contraction i'th' is found but once in a Massinger scene, it occurs a total of 12 times in scenes by Fletcher. All instances of o'th' (7), h'as (6), and 's for his (2) are found in scenes by Fletcher. In view of the systematic suppression of ye throughout Fletcher's portion of the play, it seems clear that Massinger is responsible for the final form of the extant text. That the play was originally a colloborated work, and not a Fletcherian original revised by Massinger, is attested to by the manner in which Fletcher's ye , his preference for 'em and his use of i'th', o'th , and the like are preserved together in scenes which bear the stamp of his style, and are not diffused throughout the whole. The Elder Brother Fletcher: II; III; IV. Massinger: I; V. This I regard as a Fletcherian original, the first and last acts of which have been virtually rewritten by Massinger. The manner in which Fletcher's linguistic forms appear in what are otherwise Massinger scenes tends, I think, to point in the direction of such a theory. Ye occurs a total of 60 times in the three acts of Fletcher's authorship; it is found 6 times in Massinger's portion of the play. Y' , which appears 20 times in Fletcher's scenes, is found 7 times in scenes by Massinger. The distinction in Fletcher and Massinger's preferences for 'em and them is here apparent. In the Fletcher scenes, 'em appears 25 times, them 12 times, as compared with 5 occurrences of 'em and 16 of them in scenes by Massinger. But the occurrence of the other significant contractions is not confined to Fletcher's share of the play, as is elsewhere the case in a Fletcher-Massinger collaboration. I'th' , found 4 times in scenes by Fletcher, occurs twice in scenes by Massinger. O'th' , found 4 times in the Fletcherian portion, appears 3 times in Massinger's scenes. In the shares of each, 's for his occurs 4 times. The total of 60 ye 's in three acts of Fletcher's sole authorship is hardly as great as one would expect from the occurrence of the form in single acts of such other collaborated plays as Barnavelt, The Prophetess, The False One , or even the third act—not of Fletcher's sole authorship—of The Custom of the Country . The supposition would be that Massinger, in addition to re-writing Acts I and V, tended to reduce the occurrence of ye throughout the play. A further supposition might be that, at the same time, he introduced an occasional hath . The form, which occurs 7 times in Massinger's two acts, is found 5 times in Fletcher's three. The False One Fletcher: II; III; IV. Massinger: I; V. The distribution of pronominal ye in the play makes the respective shares of the two dramatists clear enough. The form occurs not at all in Act I, and is found but once in Act V. In Acts II, III, and IV it is used a total of 115 times. The scenes in which ye abounds are marked by the infrequent use of hath . Of the 12 occurrences of hath in the play, 8 appear in Act I, 3 in Act V, and only one in a scene (II, 3) in which the Fletcherian ye predominates. The Massinger scenes show a decided preference for the expanded pronominal form them (which is used 20 times) over the contraction 'em (used but 5 times). The reverse is true in the Fletcherian portion, where 'em appears 22 times, them 9 times. It is in the scenes of Fletcher's authorship that all instances of the contractions i'th', o'th', h'as, 's for his , and let's are to be found. Like Barnavelt then, The False One is preserved in a text which has carefully preserved the respective linguistic preferences of the two dramatists. Like the manuscript of Barnavelt , the manuscript behind the first folio text of The False One is, I think, the work of the scribe Ralph Crane. One of Crane's chief scribal characteristics is his use of parentheses, and especially parentheses around proper names, forms of address, or nouns used in the vocative. I have examined two manuscripts known to have been prepared by him, and find examples of this practice on almost every page. Thus, in his manuscript of Fletcher's Demetrius and Enanthe we find, among many others: "I will (Celia)" [line 550], "there's a braine (brother)" [l.620], "by heauen (Sir)" [l. 929], "take heede (Woman)" [l. 1263], "I will (Soldier)" [l. 1714], "sett 'em-off (Lady)" [l. 2009], and "see her (deere Leontius )" [l. 3119]. Similarly, in his manuscript of Middleton's The Witch , the same practice is found to obtain. To cite but a few examples: "here am I (Mother)" [l. 255], "I cannot blame you (Sister)" [l. 524], "Where are You (Sir)" [l. 708], " 'tis my Master (Sirha)" [l. 1062], "thus (Madam)" [l. 1267], "I dare fight (Sir)" [l. 1795], "I did indeed (my Lord)" [l. 2091]. In the first folio text of The False One , the use of parentheses is to be found as well. Thus we have: "Truth needs ( Septinius ) no oaths" [121b], "Stand farther off (good Sceva )" [128b], "for our meanes (Sir)" [132a], "I doe not use to waite (Lady)" [135a], "Where are thy threates now (foole)" [141b], "now (my dearest)" [142b]. Like Crane's manuscript of Barnavelt, Demetrius and Enanthe , and The Witch , the first folio text of The False One is divided into scenes. With the exception of The Elder Brother (and Act III of The Custom of the Country ), only four of the Fletcher-Massinger plays have scene divisions: Barnavelt, The False One, The Prophetess , and The Spanish Curate. Barnavelt we know to be a Crane manuscript. The printed text of The False One we have seen to contain one of his most striking scribal characteristics, and it will be seen that the first folio texts of the other two plays display the same characteristics. This use of parentheses around vocatives is not present in the text of any of the other eleven plays of Fletcher and Massinger's joint authorship. The four plays which I have specified are further set apart by the fact that they alone of the Fletcher-Massinger collaborations preserve the linguistic patterns which we know to distinguish the respective work of the two dramatists in a clear and immediately discernible manner. For the two patterns to emerge so sharply within a single play, the author's foul papers would have had of necessity to be transcribed by a scribe who would reproduce the Fletcherian ye as carefully as we know Crane to have reproduced it in his transcript of Demetrius and Enanthe . All of these considerations then—division into scenes, use of the parentheses with vocatives, and the preservation of ye —make it seem valid to assume that the first folio texts of The False One, The Prophetess and The Spanish Curate were printed from manuscripts prepared by Crane. The Little French Lawyer Fletcher: II; III, 1-2, 4; IV, 1-4, 6b (from entrance of La Writ to end); V, 1a (to second entrance of Cleremont), 2. Massinger: I; III, 3; IV, 5, 6a (to entrance of La Writ), 7; V, 1b (from second entrance of Cleremont to end), 3. That the play is a Fletcher-Massinger collaboration is certain, but Massinger seems to have given the final form to the extant text, with the result that the linguistic evidence is somewhat obscured. Nonetheless, ye , which occurs but 30 times in the entire play, appears 26 times in the portion assigned to Fletcher, 4 times in the portion assigned to Massinger. And such other linguistic evidence as is available distinguishes clearly enough, on the whole, the respective shares of the two authors. Hath , which does not occur in the scenes by Fletcher, is used 9 times in the Massinger scenes. Fletcher's scenes reveal his usual preference for the contracted 'em to the expanded form them ( 'em occurs 23 times, them 4 times in scenes of his authorship). Massinger's share does not, however, exhibit his customary preference for them to 'em (here each form occurs 15 times). The contraction i'th' , present only once in the Massinger share, occurs 10 times in Fletcher's scenes, and all instances of such other contractions as y ' (8), o'th' (3), h'as (1), 's for his (4) appear in the Fletcherian portion. The nature of the manuscript behind the first folio text may shed some light on the state of the linguistic evidence. There seems hardly any doubt that the manuscript derives from a theatrical prompt-book. In III, 3 (64a), the word "Wine" appears in the margin, eleven lines before the stage direction, "Enter Nurse with Wine," thus evidently serving as a warning to the prompter to have the necessary property on hand at the proper moment. But the text abounds with other stage directions which it is difficult to imagine would ever have had their origin in a play-house. Such directions as "Enter Cleremont, as in the field" (56a) and "Enter a company of Gentlemen, like Ruffians" (68a) do not seem particularly relevant from a prompter's point of view, and such a direction as "Enter Nurse and Charloth, pass ore the stage with pillowes / night cloath and such things" (63b) is a bit vague for his purposes. Finally, such a marginal direction as "A strange Musick. / Sackbut &amp; Troup mu-/sick" (71a) makes it clear that we are here dealing with an author's manuscript which has been adapted for use as a prompt-book. The direction for "A strange Musick" is a typically authorial one, which the prompter has made specific by his addition, immediately beneath it in the margin, of "Sackbut &amp; Troup musick." It seems fairly certain that the author who prepared the manuscript which came to serve as the prompt-book for The Little French Lawyer was Massinger. Directions such as that for "A strange Musick" are common in his unaided plays. 4 The direction at the beginning of Fletcher's V, 1a of The Little French Lawyer , "Enter one and opens the Chamber doore, in which La-/mira and Anabell were shut, they in all feare" (71a)—a "literary" stage direction if there ever was one—calls to mind in the very manner of its phrasing such a direction as "The Hangmen torment 'em, they still smiling," from III, 1 of Massinger's The Roman Actor (sig. F3). If, as seems likely, Massinger did in fact transcribe the finished manuscript of The Little French Lawyer , the supposition would be that, in the process, he pruned away some of the Fletcherian ye 's, a form for which, as we know from his unaided plays, he had no great regard. The Lovers' Progress Fletcher: I, 2b (from entrance of Dorilaus to end); II; III, 2-3, 5-6. Massinger: I, 1, 2a (to entrance of Dorilaus); III, 1, 4; IV; V. Both the prologue and epilogue declare the play to be a revision of a work of Fletcher's and the linguistic evidence indicates clearly enough that the extant text represents this revision and not the Fletcherian original. That the reviser was Massinger—whose work is present in the play beyond any doubt—seems certain. The only question that arises, then, is whether Massinger was in fact revising a play of Fletcher's sole authorship—as prologue and epilogue declare—or whether he was reworking a play of which he and Fletcher were joint authors. Did the Massinger portions stand in some degree in the original version of the play, or do they enter the text only with the subsequent revision? The evidence is far from conclusive, but I tend to favor the theory that Massinger's role was that of reviser only, and that originally the play stood as a product of Fletcher's sole authorship. In support of this is the manner in which ye —though its occurrence has apparently been reduced in the act of revision—is to be found throughout the play, and not in single acts or scenes as is elsewhere the case in plays originally of Fletcher and Massinger's joint authorship. The form, which occurs a total of 101 times, is to be found at least once in all but three scenes of The Lovers' Progress . Almost equally significant is the occurrence of the forms 'em and them . In the other plays that represent original Fletcher-Massinger collaborations, even when the evidence of ye has been to some extent obscured, there emerges a sharp distinction between the respective preferences of the two dramatists for the contracted and the expanded forms. Here, 'em is to be found in all a total of 15 times; them appears but 3 times in the play. The preference for 'em , like the occurrence of ye , is not confined to specific acts or scenes, but seems to provide the play as a whole with a single, underlying linguistic pattern, that of Fletcher. The Prophetess Fletcher: I; III; V, 3. Massinger: II; IV; V, 1-2. The first folio text of the play, with its abundant use of parentheses with the vocative, 5 its division into scenes, and its scrupulous observance of the Fletcherian ye , almost certainly derives from a Crane transcript. The faithful reproduction of ye makes the attribution of the respective shares of the two dramatists a relatively simple affair. In the Fletcherian portion, ye occurs 166 times; in Massinger's share it is found but once. Hath appears but a single time in Fletcher's scenes, 8 times in scenes by Massinger. While 'em occurs 20 times in Fletcher's portion, and them but twice, the two forms appear respectively 9 and 12 times in scenes by Massinger. All occurrences of i'th' (2), h'as (1), 's for his (3) and, with one exception, o'th' (the form is used 7 times in all) appear in Fletcher's portion of the play. The Sea Voyage Fletcher: I; IV. Massinger: II; III; V. The play presents difficulties, for though the work of both Fletcher and Massinger is present beyond any doubt, it is not entirely certain whether one is dealing with a Fletcherian original revised in part by Massinger, or with a Fletcher-Massinger collaboration to which Fletcher, reversing the usual practice, has given the final form. The difficulties spring from the manner in which ye pervades—though not with equal frequency—the entire play from beginning to end. Acts I and IV, containing 67 and 123 ye 's respectively, are comparable, on this point at least, to any single acts in any of Fletcher's unaided plays. Also in favor of Fletcher's sole authorship of the original is the fact that the contraction 'em occurs throughout the play (a total of 85 times), and the expanded them is hardly used at all (but 4 times). Thus the extent to which hath appears most unexpectedly in scenes heavily stamped with the Fletcherian ye suggests the possibility of Massinger's revising hand altering Fletcher's linguistic pattern. This, however, I do not believe to be the case. On the evidence of such plays as The Little French Lawyer and The Double Marriage , it seems certain that the Fletcherian ye would not be present in such abundance in The Sea Voyage if that play had been reworked by Massinger in any noticeable degree. It seems far more likely that, in this case, Fletcher was responsible for the play's final form. Only thus can I account for the fact that Acts II, V, and the last half of Act III, while marked with some of the most characteristic examples of Massinger's vocabulary and syntax, exhibit an occurrence of ye unknown in any of his work elsewhere. The Spanish Curate Fletcher: II; III, 1-2, 4; IV, 3, 5-7; V, 2. Massinger: I; III, 3; IV, 1-2, 4; V, 1, 3. This affords one of the clearest examples of a Fletcher-Massinger collaboration in the canon. Linguistically, the play divides into two distinct parts, determined by the occurrence of ye . The form occurs but 5 times in the scenes assigned to Massinger, but it is found a total of 268 times in the Fletcherian portion. Almost equally striking is the occurrence of hath . In Massinger's first act, where ye does not occur, hath appears 7 times. The Fletcherian second act, with its 57 ye 's, contains no hath 's. Of the 10 hath 's to be found in the remaining three acts, all but two appear in scenes by Massinger. Such contractions as are to be found in the play occur, almost without exception, in the Fletcherian scenes. With only two exceptions (IV, 1 and V, 1), the expanded pronominal form them occurs more frequently than the contracted 'em in scenes by Massinger. The reverse obtains in scenes by Fletcher, where 'em is always the predominant form. The relevant figures make this clear enough: while 'em occurs but 7 times and them 13 times in the scenes by Massinger, 'em is found 36 times and them but twice in the scenes by Fletcher. Without exception, all occurrences of i'th', o'th', h'as , and 's for his appear in Fletcher's portion. That the first folio text of the play was printed from a Crane manuscript is, I think, indicated by the preservation of the Fletcherian ye , by the division into scenes, and by the use of parentheses with the vocative, a practice that is illustrated in the following: "give me leave (deare friend)" [25b], "Is it my fault (Don Henrique)" [28b], "Dost thou remember (Diego)" [30b], "It seems so (neighbours)" [32a], "What noise was this (wife?) [39a], "Be wholy hers (my Lord)" [40a], "No more (sweet wife)" [44b]. A Very Woman Fletcher: II, 3b (from exit of the Duke to end); III; IV, 1, 3. Massinger: I; II, 1-2, 3a (to exit of the Duke); IV, 2; V. Despite the fact that the play was licensed for acting as Massinger's on 6 June 1634, nine years after Fletcher's death, and the further fact that it was first printed as one of Massinger's Three New Plays in 1655, having been omitted from the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher Folio, there is no doubt at all that it contains the work of both Fletcher and Massinger. The prologue declares A Very Woman to be a revision of an old play "long since acted," and the supposition is then that here, as in The Lovers' Progress and The Elder Brother , Massinger is revising a Fletcherian original. The 1634 licensing date is thus explained, for as we know from the case of The Woman's Prize , it is just at this period that the Master of the Revels was insisting that old plays must be relicensed if they were to be re-staged. 6 Particularly if one is to suppose A Very Woman to have been re-written in large part when it was put back on the stage in 1634, it would have to have been licensed anew. The fact that it should have been licensed as Massinger's is reasonable enough since he was the reviser, and the original author was dead. The three Fletcherian originals which Massinger revised have a good deal in common; each gives evidences of a single underlying linguistic pattern that has been altered by a revising hand. An examination of the first act of A Very Woman , one of the most heavily revised sections of the play, is instructive. There ye occurs but once, hath 7 times, 'em not at all, them 5 times. There are no instances of i'th', o'th, h'as , or ' s for his , but there are two occurrences each of the Massinger contractions t' and of't . In the remainder of the play, however, although ye is completely absent from all but three of the Massinger scenes, and its rate of occurrence has almost certainly been reduced throughout, the linguistic evidence is much of a piece. After Act I, 'em occurs consistently in Fletcher and Massinger scenes alike through the remainder of the play, to a total of 32 times. Subsequent to Act I, them appears but 6 times. On the evidence of the first act, with its strong indication of Massinger's presence, it would seem that the preference for them to 'em would be apparent in subsequent scenes which bear his stamp if these were of his original authorship or if they had been as thoroughly revised by him as Act I. But in the remainder of the play Massinger, in the scenes which he reworked, does not seem to have been much concerned—apart from the excision of ye —with Fletcher's colloquial and contracted forms. Thus, as in The Lovers' Progress , the contraction i'th' occurs 7 times in Massinger scenes—an unusually high rate of occurrence for his work. There is no great difficulty in distinguishing the work of the two dramatists in the play. Massinger's introduction of hath into his scenes (where it occurs a total of 17 times, as compared to 3 occurrences in scenes by Fletcher), and the absence of ye from his portion (where it appears but 5 times, as compared to 75 times in Fletcher's share), affords as always the basis for separating the work of the two dramatists in collaboration.

      <field name="heading_text">An Initiation Into Initials by Franklin B. Williams, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE THESIS OF THIS STUDY IS THAT MANY MINOR discoveries await the literary detective prepared to apply ingenuity to the hundreds of initials that appear in British Renaissance books. The body of the study consists of a survey of problems, with numerous examples. Younger scholars may profit from the instruction; old hands will at least be grateful for the illustrations. Lest it be suspected that "M, O, A, I, doth sway my life," I hasten to give assurance that no time will be wasted rehearsing disputes over such cruxes as Mr. W. H. of Shakespeare's Sonnets and E. K. of Preliminary notes are in order on two points: the method of routine The Shepherd's Calendar . documentation and the source of the solutions cited. All examples of initials are from British books published before 1641; these are cited by date and by serial number in the standard bibliography, A. W. Pollard and Redgrave's Short-Title Catalogue, 1475-1640 (London, 1926). I have endeavored to give credit for all solutions that I have borrowed. Solutions for which no authority is cited may be considered to be either in the common domain or now independently advanced by the writer. Of course it is possible that some of mine may have been noted earlier by others. Before entering on an exploration of the field, the reader may appreciate, as an interest arouser, sample solutions to illustrate the use of external and internal evidence. A pretty Spenser problem shows that opportunity remains for discovery. Over the past century authorities have been content to observe that one of Edmund Spenser's last published poems was his set of commendatory verses before The Historie of George Castriot (1596-15318), translated by Z. I. One might suppose that such an unusual signature would have spurred search, although I confess that I have met another Z[acharias] I[enkinson], a Rutlandshire preacher (1620-11838). The Castriot translation, however, is explicitly claimed by Zachary Jones in the epistle to the reader before his translation of A Treatise of Specters (1605-15448). Accordingly we may add to the circle of Spenser's friends a Lincoln's Inn barrister who had been a younger contemporary of the poet at Cambridge. Detection of this link has perhaps been delayed by the fact that STC misprints the name of the translator of the Treatise as L. Jones. This is a neat example of the danger of manuscript copy, for the error occurred in setting from manuscript slips prepared from the British Museum catalogue of English books before 1641, where the name is correctly printed as Z. Jones. As an example of internal evidence, we may consider Henry Perry's Eglvryn Phraethineb (1595-19775), with commendatory Latin verses by "I. H. Novi Coll. &amp; nov. Temp. Socius." The only contemporary I. H. who could claim to be both a fellow of New College, Oxford, and a member of the Middle Temple was the noted wit John Hoskins. The aura of the signature confirms the identification, for Hoskins had many Welsh connections and his wit shows in the rather obscure designation for the Middle Temple in order to balance with "Novi Coll." Thus a poem is added to the Hoskins canon. The precision of these proofs suggests a warning. Nothing is more futile than irresponsible conjecture. Almost as bad is premature satisfaction when one has hit on a likely fellow whose name fits. Much print has been wasted listing possible candidates. Cautionary examples are in order. Even so reliable a scholar as Edward F. Rimbault, in editing Overbury, suggested that the E. G. with verses before A Wife (1616-18910) was Edmund Gayton, who was in fact about eight years old at the time. In his abridgment of Sylvester's DuBartas, 1 Theron W. Haight felt obliged to advance plausible candidates for most of the commendatory verse writers. An unrecorded 1598 installment of Sylvester's translation has recently come to light at the Folger Library. This reveals the actual writers in three instances. Haight had conjectured that the R. H. (1605-21649) was Robert Hasill, a sufficiently obscure versifier. He now proves to be rather a complete nonentity, R: Hyther. Haight prudently made no guesses for the other two: G[eorge] B[urgh] Cantabridg. and Si[mon] Ca[rril] Gen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Imaginary and Null Initials The probability that beginning students will make mistakes is no reason for not warning against certain mirage initials. Horrible examples may be cited, but charity forbids. Students unfamiliar with Renaissance conventions of Latin composition have mistaken abbreviated formulas for personal initials, especially in such common phrases as S [ alutem ] P [ lurimam ] or D [ o ] D [ ico ], that is, "dedicates." Students must be alert to such series and have a glossary of abbreviations at hand if they are to cope with a run like that with which "R[ichard] M[ontagu] . . . L.M.M.M.D.D.C.Q." to the memory of James I (1635-18033). Brief, meaningless syllables serving as printers' catchwords have been mistaken for initials. As if in compensation, catchwords in rare instances may reveal what an editor thought he had suppressed in proof: 1566 22222 W. R. Catchword: William Having made sure that the initials truly are initials, a beginner must read them correctly. Renaissance type contains a few pitfalls. A common form of swash italic J has on occasion been misread as F or T . In some Greek fonts II may be mistaken for Γ, as in the signature Aλ.IIρ. before Heywood's Apology for Actors (1612-13309). Printers are sometimes eccentric, as in setting Diag. Vuh. for Degory Wheare. When latinized, a few Christian names shift initial, chiefly those in W like G[ulielmus]. Arbitrary initials of the John Doe variety must next be detected and discounted. These are usually A. B. or some variant of N. N[ame or Nomen]. The initials A. B. are always suspect and likewise C. D. when used in conjunction with them. There is no need to repeat the evidence collected years ago by Fredson Bowers, 2 nor to concede that some examples are genuine. The following may be ruled fictitious with some confidence: 1623 18305 A. B. Author of a dangerous book 1626 10734 A. B. "Editor" 1610 3271 A. B. Mask of recusant 1597 17323 A. B. Friend of stationer 1640 23307 A. B. Clergyman editor 1606 24567 Cousins A. B. C. D. 1605 3524 Friend N. 1592 19885 N., Secretary to L. Treasurer 1597 1311 N. N., Baccha.Di.Coll.S.Ioan. No such man 1584 24050 Q. Z. of Lions Inne 1633 14444 X. Z. "William Watts" in second issue The classic example is the A. B. epistle before Savile's Tacitus (1591-23642), attributed to the Earl of Essex on the authority of contemporary allusions (as in 1595-11276) and of Ben Jonson's later remark to Drummond. 3 However, the signature T. N. to an epistle by Henry Chettle (1592-17206) resulted from the misapprehension that Thomas Nash had written it. 4 This is the logical place to mention another suspicious phenomenon. In some books there are disingenuous juxtapositions; a translation by Rowland Willet contains verses by W. R., I. H., and H. I. (1617-21510).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Variant Versions The next step is to examine other copies of the book to ascertain whether a fuller form of the name occurs in press variants, variant issues or special copies. As the following instances demonstrate, this appears oftener than might be suspected: 1640 3818 R. C. Rob. Chamberlain 1620 26041 T.D. Thomas Dewe 1618 13581 Hen: Far: Hen: Farley 1640 18948 V. H.

Richard Wroth Unhappily this procedure is a two-edged weapon, for instead of the desired completion to the initials, a different copy or edition may reveal a conflicting version. Some are recognizable as corruptions incident to Renaissance reprints: [1620] 15688 A. R. In earlier editions: R. A[llot] 1604 13980 T. W. In earlier editions: W. H[unnis] 1628 5670 C. E. Other issues, E. C[ooke] When the alteration occurs within the sheets of a single edition, the authentic form can be determined, if at all, only by external evidence or by bibliographical methods beyond the scope of this study: 1616 18909 G.

Latter presumably a correction When an alteration is made in a later edition one hopes —and sometimes can prove— that the change is a deliberate correction. Since writers on Sir John Harington seem to have overlooked it, this example may be instanced. Epistle v.9 in the third volume of Joseph Hall's Epistles (1611-12662) is addressed to S. H. I., although the context suggests that the form should be S. I. H[arington]. In fact, Harington's name is substituted in the next printing (1614-12706). But usually when a change is made in a later edition, one must weigh distasteful alternatives: an authorized correction or a reprint corruption? 1602 1666 A. F. J. F. in STC 1665 1619 1547 H. P. P.

P. in STC 19081 (a reprint) Furthermore, some of the reversed initials discussed later may in fact be simple typographical errors. From time to time one encounters initials that have been completed, altered or cancelled in manuscript —a sight likely to impress beginners. Examples may be cited of all degrees of authenticity or dubiety. Since each instance must be judged individually with a discipline involving paleography, I am reluctantly obliged to bypass this interesting field.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Integrated Affixes In view of the rarity of more than one Christian name among Renaissance Englishmen, it may be assumed that any signature involving more than two letters is either a misprint— 1603 18511 I.O:St.G. For: Io[hn] St. G[eorge] See STC 12500 or a foreign name— 1579 18157 R. L. M. Robert Le Maçon Solutions by Fernand 1579 18157 M. L. S. Marin Le Saux de Schickler or incorporates some type of affix. Since the LL. of Welsh surnames is a single unit, the principle is not violated by signatures like "T.LL. artium Magister" (1636-21620). Unhappily, even a two-unit signature may incorporate an affix, although one hopes that this happens seldom: 1599 14335 D. B. D[r. Richard] B[ancroft] See STC 14658 1636 23992 M. C. M[aster Thomas] C[arre] This way madness lies, as is evident in the formula "doctissimo viro D.J.S.P.D." (1636-1576), where there is only one operative letter: "Domino J., Salutem Plurimam Dicit." Related are signatures reflecting the formal style of lords spiritual and temporal or an editor's informal substitute: 1635 12613 J. E. J[oseph Hall, Bishop of] E[xeter] 1564 14591 M. C.

      <field name="fulltext">Limiting Appendages More easily recognized and in general helpful for their valuable clues are the standard appendages to initial signatures. First come the designations of the universities, in such form as Oxon. or Cantab ., and of the Inns of Court. Next come the standard degrees and related sigla, such as M.A., S.T.B., M.D., LL.B., L[icentiate], and for lawyers, I[uris] C[onsultus]. Since it does not necessarily imply a university connection, the term Theologus is troublesome. Mathematicians and almanackmakers using the term Philomath often had no academic training. 1623 22091 L. B. S. T. L. 1640 6190 T. T. Phil. Cand. 1633 13988 I. C. philomath. 1613 20505 I. W.

Next come the designations of the various colleges and a few schools. The easiest place to find these in profusion is in university collections of complimentary verses, but here are some others: 1596 4758 M. G. M. D. Ioannensis Matthew Gwinne 1634 10935 H. B. ex A[lban] A[ula], A. M. Henry Beesley 1600 23474 R. K., L[incoln] Col. Richard Kilbye 1628 25327 S. B., Th.B., Sch. M[agdal.] Rectori Samuel Bernard 1619 1646 J.

In this context T. C. means Trinity College, but Benefield is unrecorded at Cambridge. He was a member of Gray's Inn, and we amend to "I. C." There follow a variety of designations, some common like V.M. or V[erbi] M[inister] D[ei], others rare, like P[raeli] C[orrector], found only in Cambridge books. Place names may be grouped here. If one encounters "H. B. Calesian," one is dealing with Henry Bennett. 1620 13582 S. R. V. M. Eccl:Belg:Lond: Symeon Ruytinck 1625 4477 R. W. Regal. P. C. Ralph Winterton [1623] 7376 M. D. V. N[obilis] G[enoa?] One of the most notorious of these signatures deserves notice, if only because I believe it has been consistently misinterpreted. Thomas James, first Bodleian librarian, was accustomed to append B. P. N. to his signature, as in the imposing formula: T. I. S. T. P[rof.] B. P. N. (1625?-14455). A reputable but reprehensible tradition foists on James the vanity of pretending that he was B[ono] P[ublico] N[atus]. 6 From evidence in another of his books (1627-14457), I prefer to think that he was more modestly claiming to be B[odleianus] P[rotobibliothecarius] N[uperrime]. One class of appendage deserves more attention than it has received, the Latin motto. A motto may reveal identity in two ways. In rare instances it is a deliberate anagram of the author's name: 1614 18611 R. N. Non luco, subter Rosis. Robertus Nicolsonus 7 1597 7193 E. Sc. Duris decus omen. Edmundus Scory Hebel's Drayton In other instances it may be a habitual and recognizable motto, such as George Gascoigne's Tam Marti quam Mercurio , which underlies a remarkable solution by Charles T. Prouty: 8 [1575] 24328 T. M. Q. T[am] M[arti] Q[uam Mercurio, i.e., Gascoigne] The following examples are offered for solution: 1591 21057 J. D. Tam Arte, quam Marte 1586 10824 W. L. Spes &amp; Fortuna valete Inner Temple 1579 24062 Coelum, non Solum, W. M. 1578 6984 T. N. Petit ardua virtus Thomas Newton? 1605 21649 R. R. Malum patienti lucrum One may venture the precarious generalization that a long string of letters offers more clues. Monstrous series are commoner on the Continent, whence comes the alchemist Michael Maier's signature (1616-667): M.M.C.P.M.D.E.E.P.C. From evidence elsewhere in the volume this may be solved as: Comes Palatinus, Medicinae Doctor, Eques Exemptus — you finish it! Even here there are problems: 1611 3369 L. A. B. V. M. Lord Anthony Browne, Viscount Montagu 1630 6385 F. L. D. S. M. Father Leander de Saint Martin 1573 19060 Rogatu honoratiss.viri D. H. S. W. P. 1640 7240 Lady, G. O. C. K. No English earldom to fit 1605 24714 R. Y. S. M. L. A. D. Recusant mask This last pseudonym of the translator of a Catholic book is a mystification suggesting something in the order of Lady Mary S. But the dedication to the translator's mother does not imply a feminine translator, and the mystification may merely mean a spiritual son of the Blessed Virgin, although the mother addressed in the dedication is the human mother. Such a series may be compound. The signature G. B. T. H. P. to a Latin epitaph on the author (1567-4009) probably implies verses in memory of G[ulielmus] B[uckley] by one T.H., who according to the evidence in a later edition (1574-22252) edited the book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">S[tandard] O[perating] P[rocedure] Having mastered the habit of scrutinizing initials, one may now come to grips with cases. For any preliminary epistle or verses, the first step is to check whether it bears the initials of printer or bookseller. Richard Jones and many others were in the habit of providing initialed forewords. Usually a glance at the imprint will suffice, although it may be necessary to consult the Stationers' Register. Thus judging from STC , one must consult the Register to identify T[homas] W[oodcock] (1583-4442), but in fact an unrecorded issue survives with Woodcock in the imprint (copies at Folger and Harvard). One must remember that the designation "Printer" was used loosely by editors and others. Even when the term has a more exact significance, it may be necessary to search beyond imprint and copyright entry to more elusive data, such as external knowledge of business partnership: 1596 20366a H. C. Printer Henry Chettle [1573] 4712 J. S. John Stroud 9 One marvels at both the courage and rashness of Stroud in signing his foreword. One suspects that his initials conclude the formula J. T. J. S. in a related book ([1572]-10850). The next step is to watch for evidence within the volume itself. Hints may appear in many forms and places. I am unfamiliar with the proof that I[ohn] M[elton] wrote A Six-folde Politician (1609-17805), but one is set on the right track by the preliminary verses of I. S., which begin, "Thy tun. . . of wit &amp; hony"—that is, mel-tun . Reference in the text to "Barnhere" nails down the preacher T[homas] B[ernhere] (1606-10668). Such evidence may amount only to strong probability. 1575 12188 G. C. Later verses by G[ul.] Camden 1615 14665 F. A. Later verses to Francis Appleby 1614 23779 Sa:Cal. Later verses to Samuel Calvert 1613 25891 Th. C. Later verses to Thomas Cranly 1620 16684 G. F. Earlier verses to George Franklyn Mention of specific kinship may enable one to identify a dedicatee or, conversely, an author: 1613 23067 Uncle, Fr. Sa. Francis Sanders DNB 1623 143 A[rchibald] S[imson] Mentions uncle, identifiable as Patrick Simson 1626 18156 A[nthony] R[atcliffe] Names his sisters. 10 External evidence is almost infinite in variety —as manuscripts, contemporary allusions, clues in other books, and knowledge of friendships. The verses before Samuel Ward's pamphlet on the Synod of Dort (1626-25026) are by Tho[mas] Go[ad] because the two were colleagues at Dort. Internal evidence in Harington's Ajax books equates E. S. Esquier (1596-12772) with Philostilpnos, while what appears to be Harington's holograph note in a Folger copy identifies Philostilpnos as Edward Sheldon. The following solutions by other scholars indicate varieties of evidence: 1616 18909 W[illiam] B[rowne] Browne MS. in British Museum 1607 14783 I[ohn] D[onne] Reprinted in 1650 Poems 1629 1694 Ph[ilip] Kin[der] Mark Eccles, HLQ , V (1942), 299. 1635 2418 E[dward] M[illar] Millar Patrick 1593 22540 H[ugh] S[anford] Frances Yates, Florio The following solutions are now newly advanced: 1635 12141 E[dward] A[lliston] Association in 1640-18948 1633 12716 I[ames] A[rthur] Echo in 1637-15717 1618 1635 E[zechiel] C[harke] Charke edited other Baynes works 1598 12322 H.

      <field name="fulltext">Calculus of Probabilities Now and then there is a signature that, to one working in the period, has the stamp of inevitability either from the rarity of the combination or the familiarity of the attributes: 1623 23352 W. Q. Walter Quin 1632 24809 W. Sq. William Squire 1601 19343 I. D. of Hereford John Davies 1620 24017 Ph. H., Coventry Philemon Holland In practice the solution of initials more often involves an appraisal of from two to twenty rival candidates in the light of probabilities and detectable links. The results range from certainty to complete frustration. Thus we can confidently identify the "worthy Prelate, Doctor N[icholas] F[elton]" (1618-3950), since he was the only contemporary bishop with the initials. But when we turn to the Countess of D., patroness of an unrecorded 1639 work of piety by Thomas Riley in the Folger Library, we find nine possibles and no clear links, although we may intuitively favor that religious Countess of Denbigh who later helped Richard Crashaw. Illustrations cannot be tabulated, since each requires comment. Thus only Nathaniel Holmes fits the formula "N. H., S. T. D., Oxon." of the editor of a Hebrew grammar (1638-21816), and since he was known as a Hebrew scholar, we confidently add the book to his works. The learned knight K. D. who donated to the Bodleian must be Sir Kenelm Digby (1635-12613). W. R. Mag. Art. C. C. C. (1613-21069) must be Bacon's later editor, William Rawley. A search shows that for the verses before Overbury's Wife (1616-18911) by P. B. medij Temp. we have two candidates, of whom Sir Peter Ball is weak since he was not admitted until February, 1616. Accordingly we settle on Peter Bevis, who has verses before other books in 1612 and 1615, and we attribute to him likewise similar verses to Robert Anton (1616-686). Difficulty may result from misleading clues. M. Ed. F., rector of Kelso, ([1592]-25695) is untraceable in Scotland because he is Edward Franklin of Kelshall, Herts. We sniff a scent when the verses of F. L. in Hawkins' Horace (1625-13800) show the appendage Eq. Aur. in the 1631 edition. But alas, no one of these initials was dubbed between 1625 and 1631, and the elusive versifier must be sought among men knighted before 1623. Richard Brathwait had a penchant for dedicating to initials; one example may be instructive. A section of his Essaies (1620-3566) is addressed to Sir I. B. de L., J. P., and his eldest son H. B. Since some fifty Englishmen with these initials had been knighted in the previous thirty years, we must shift our approach to Brathwait's lasting loyalty to his home county, Westmoreland. With the search thus narrowed, we soon find Sir James Bellingham of Levens and his son Henry (later I Bart.). Having solved the problem, we wonder why Brathwait scholars did not trouble to. Why? One obvious reason is that such research involves much drudgery. One must seek through lists of knights, registers of universities and inns of court, and heraldic visitations —always with the wry realization that not one of them can be relied on to be complete. Brathwait's countryman S[ir] W. C. kt. (1621-3571) may be traced by someone willing to work through forty candidates, but as a starter I would suggest the field of six fitting his Sr. G. D. (1621-3589). One constantly meets defeat or —to preserve morale— temporarily shelves a problem. Two instances will suffice. For the Sir I. P. Knight to whom Sir John Hayward addresses a treatise (1606-13001) there are twenty-seven possibilities. There are more than twenty rivals for the Latin verses of H. S. Eques Auratus (1629-21752), though one is predisposed to favor Sir Henry Spelman. The situation is complicated by instances in which results of a search are negative. Thus no known knight fits the signature Sir E. K. (1591-21057), and presumably he is a fiction. A signature as circumstantial as A. B. Baccha. Di. Auloe [ sic ] Glo. Oxon. (1597-1311) corresponds to no traceable man, and accordingly one looks with suspicion on the other Oxford signatures puffing this textbook by Peter Bales.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Special Techniques In the absence of a general catalyst or philosopher's stone to solve initials, techniques may be developed for special cases. One technique involves synthesis from several signatures that can reasonably be attributed to a single individual. As type specimen, we announce discovery of a prolific puff-writer, Christopher Goodfellow, a name certainly appropriate! Commendatory verses for poetry of Humphrey Mill (1640-17921) are supplied before the book by C. G. ex Oxon. and after the book by C. G. Interioris Templi. The only Templar to fit is one Christopher Goodfellow, who is also easily found at Oxford. With this start we may diagnose as Goodfellow's an epidemic of 1640 verses by C. G., often claiming friendship with the author. These include two plays by Richard Brome (3818, 3820), a book by John Tatham (23704), a jest-book (4943), a play by Thomas Rawlins (20770), and a play by Thomas Nabbes (18346), as well as an earlier Nabbes book (1638-18343). Similarly verses signed G. G. or G. Ga. appear before three fashionable books in 1607 (such as 1607-4508), while verses by an obscure George Gaywood occur close by (1606?-21407). The equation is plausible. Gaywood had written such verses as early as 1598-21661. How far forward or backward may one safely range? Is he the G. G. with verses before Boethius (1609-3202)? Nothing seems to be known about Gaywood beyond Joseph Hunter's unpublished notes showing that he was employed by an Exchequer agent who defalcated in 1609. One suspects that a single individual was responsible for Latin and Greek verses in a Mercator atlas (1635-17824) variously signed R. B. Cantabrigiae, R. B. S. Hosp., and R. B. S. S. M. As a first step in identifying E. B. (1640-4946) we assume that he is the E. B. with verses before two other plays in the same year (18346 and 20770). R. W. has verses before an overlapping set of three plays. J. L. edits four legal books between 1621 and 1632 (7437), while Ro. Lo. does editorial work on two religious books (12635, 5218). Editorial work on no less than five legal books was done in the 1540's by W. S., perhaps Sir William Stanford. A second technique involves the detection of recurrent patterns of names. Just as the chemist senses the presence of the familiar benzene ring of six carbon atoms, the literary student observes more fluctuating groups recurring from book to book. If he can identify a member of the group in one book, the identification will serve in others. Here is a type of "guilt by association" that is academically acceptable! Such patterns were the evidence for my identification of a sonnet by M[ichael] D[rayton] (1600-25225). 11 Whenever I have time to perfect this technique, my first project will be in the circle of Sir Thomas Hawkins. A few examples from a single book (1639-12205) will illustrate: I[ohn] H[awkins] D[octor of] M[edicine], S[ir] T[homas] H[awkins], and S[ir] I[ohn] B[eaumont, II] B[art.]. A few nests of initials may be cited for those who desire to experiment. William Goddard dedicates a book to six gentlemen of the Inner Temple ([1599]-11928) —more tricky than it sounds. The ten initialed poems before The Metamorphosis of Tabacco (1602-1695) have been the subject of many conjectures. Someone familiar with Welshmen may tackle the eight in a funeral sermon for an Earl of Essex (1577-6364). Henry Petowe dedicates to six young gentlemen, probably of the London citizenry (1603-19806). Ten Cambridge men commend a book by James Wadsworth (1630-24928); some must be identifiable, such as that gem for the name collector, M[aptid] V[iolet]. And there are always the gentlemen who puffed Overbury's Wife .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scrambled Initials We now proceed to an exasperating class—initials that have been deliberately juggled either in a spirit of fun or to achieve concealment. Until an identity has been established on external evidence, such initials supply no ground for solutions. Indeed the chief burden of the scholar in this field is not to obtain solutions to initials but to rationalize the initials to conform to external proof. The simple reversal of initials is comparatively innocuous. Some instances may be typographical errors; others are deliberate. When one considers Nicholas Breton's flood of pamphlets, it is not strange that he adopted masks; one example will suffice: 1614 3664 B. N. Nicholas Breton 1600 3191 L. N. Nicholas Ling A. H. Bullen 1631 1383 H. T. Thomas Heywood A. M. Clark 1623 18660 N. S. Silvester Norris Misprint in STC 1623 19480 P. D. M. Mr. Dr. (or Matthew Dr.) Pattenson 1569 12049 G. B. Barnaby Googe 1616 18585 N. A. Anthony Nixon That the poetaster Thomas Jordan utilized the initials J. B. (1637-14788) to deceive readers into thinking he was being commended by Ben Jonson may be suspected if one approves Percy Simpson's rejection of the piece from the Jonson canon. 12 Traditionally listed among the works of Thomas Scott are two pamphlets signed S. R. N. I. (1624-22092). British Museum cataloguers have now attributed them to another, implying that these are the much-reversed initials of I[oh]N R[eynold]S. Among more intricate devices is the use of terminal letters to form telonyms, 13 familiar in the instance of Camden: 1605 4521 M. N. [Willia]M [Camde]N 1597 6759 M. N. [Willia]M [Elderto]N See STC 6758 This Elderton instance is so incredible that it may well be a practical joke. As John Crow reminds me, Henry Holland enjoyed jokes; among other tricks in one "anonymous" book (1626-5885), he signed the dedication: HalleluiaH. In the following cases authorship appears established, so rationalization is attempted. Sorocold's verses are fully signed in the second edition, while the Jesuit Henry Hawkins' authorship has been proved by Rosemary Freeman: 14 1605 10513 S. D. [Thomas] S[orocol]D 1633 12958 H. A. [Henry] HA[awkins] The initials S. W. in various books of Robert Southwell (as 1591-22950) probably represent S[outh]W[ell]. The following conjecture is cited without endorsement: 1627 15110 S. P. L. Sir James SemPilL N&amp;Q , 5th ser., V (1876), 7-8 The degree of elaboration to which juggling of initials might extend is illustrated in the famous pseudonym Smectymnuus (1641-Wing M748), constructed of the initials of Stephen Marshal and four other Puritan divines (uuw). I have noticed no other instance of such complexity. Reference may be made to an excessively rare class, monograms like the blended HCL of Romulus and Tarquin (1637-17219). Booksellers have advanced solutions that are not only farfetched but unnecessary, for the device is fully clarified by the second edition as H[enry Lord] C[ary of] L[eppington].</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mystifications: Perverse or Tolerable? Initials derived from pseudonyms occur among the works of Francis Godwin: 1638 11943 E. M. Edward Mahon Misprint in STC 1629 11944 Ed. M. Ch. These were correctly explained as masks of Godwin by the late Grant McColley, 15 but he did not account for the Ch. in the second. McColley overlooked essential evidence in another Godwin book (1616-11941), which has the formula: "Edw. Mahonides, Aliàs Christopher." Why Godwin adopted this pseudonym remains a mystery. More common is the use of arbitrary initials as pseudonyms. At least they appear arbitrary, although they may have had esoteric meaning to the perpetrator. The signature B.C. seems meaningless, whether The Dolefull Knell (1607-19403) was written by Robert Parsons or by Philip Woodward. 16 Why should Thomas Heywood sign an epistle N. R. (1631-13313)? Many other examples are at hand, but overindulgence may induce a state of lying all night staring at one's great toe, about which initials —as namely, B[en] I[onson] (1613-22218) —fight in one's imagination. One's sympathy with initial-mongers is reserved for the persecuted minorities who had good reason for camouflage. Disguised names of Catholic controversialists have been liberally cited. Here is another example involving both author and patron: 1595 18326 C. N. dedicates to Ladie M. C. A. A saint's life (1609-4830) is dedicated to Ladie D. I., English recusant at Louvain. The internal evidence, matched with our extensive knowledge of this community, 17 proves beyond doubt that the woman was Cardinal Allen's sister-in-law, Mrs. Elizabeth Allen. But dissenters as well as recusants had good reason to conceal identities, and it is in this field that one finds the leviathan of all initials. John Penry addresses part of a rare pamphlet ([1593]-19608) to the following congregation in London, "the distressed faithful. . . wither in bondes or at liberty": My beloved brethren M.F.Iohnson M.D.M, S.M.S.M.G.I.MIM.H.M.B.M.S. R.B.M,R.M. KN.B.M.B.I.M,NP.W.C.PA. my brethren M. I.C.W.B.A.P. M. MM.E,C .CD· G.M.A.B. With the rest of you both men &amp; women. . . . Here affixes like Master are scattered so confusingly that a detailed solution is impossible. It is not only impossible; it is supererogatory, for the names of the group are preserved in the records of the persecution. 18 The plight of these sufferers for conscience reflect another world from the smart mystifications of professional writers. 19</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Notes on Keats's Letters by Hyder E. Rollins</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FOLLOWING NOTES ON THE LETTERS OF John Keats (Oxford University Press, 1952) may be of interest or use to students. 1 In general they deal, not with problems of text or arrangement, which need further investigation, but with illustrations and explanations. A few are taken from annotations in Louis A. Holman's books, now in the Houghton Library, Harvard, and a few others were contributed by my students. Magazine titles are conventionally abbreviated, and other abbreviations used are: F. W. Haydon Benjamin Robert Haydon: Correspondence and Table-Talk. With a Memoir by His Son , 2 vols., 1876. Huxley Aldous Huxley, The Autobiography and Memoirs of Benjamin Robert Haydon , new ed., 2 vols., New York, n.d. [1926]. K Keats. KC The Keats Circle , ed. Hyder E. Rollins, 2 vols., Harvard University Press, 1948. Lowell Amy Lowell, John Keats , 2 vols., Boston and New York, 1925. Milnes R. M. Milnes, Life, Letters, and Literary Remains, of John Keats , 2 vols., 1848. NED A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles . The place of publication is given for books only when it is not London. The entry numbers refer to pages. xlvii Maria Jane Jewsbury did not visit Bailey in 1831. She married W. K. Fletcher on August 1, 1832, and she and her husband went to Colombo at the end of January, 1833. 7 "Mr Towers." According to Blunden, K-SJ , III (1954), 40, John Towers moved from 6 Little Warner Street, Clerkenwell, to Thanet, Kent, in 1819. "The Sonnet to the Sun." Holman says, "Undoubtedly written by C.C.C." He adds that Clarke (see his Recollections of Writers [1878], pp. 199 f.) sent some verses, probably this sonnet, in December, 1818, to Hunt, who planned to, but did not, publish them in the Examiner . Holman's suggestion is interesting: it would explain why "one of the earliest things JK wrote," as Clarke told Woodhouse in August, 1823 ( KC , I, 274), "was a Sonnet to the Moon wh: he gave to C.C.C." 8 In the Locker-Lampson "Great Album" (see p. xiii) a letter from K. to Severn, November 1, 1816 (see M. C. Bates, K-SJ , III [1954], 81 f.), shows that his engagement was for a first visit to Haydon's studio for breakfast on Sunday, November 3. 9 "Last Evening." Haydon refers to this evening, November 19, in his journal (Huxley, p. 252). It was then that he made the profile sketch of K., dated "Nov 1816-BRH," which is reproduced by Clarke Olney, Benjamin Robert Haydon (Athens, Georgia, 1952), p. 294, and others. 11 "Golden opinions . . . sorts of men." See Macbeth , I.vii.33. 14 "The new Tragedy." Manuel was written, not by "a young Lady of 16," but by C. R. Maturin. Though it "was received and announced for repetition with great applause" ( New Monthly Magazine , VII [1817], 256 f.), Kean disliked and quickly killed it. 15 No. 10 is endorsed: "To W. F. Watson Esq re (Edinburgh—) With C Cowden Clarke's Regard, and best Wishes for Success in his interesting enterprise." William Finley Watson, bookseller (died 1881), bequeathed his collection of autographs, some 3000 items, to the National Gallery of Scotland, whence in 1930 it was transferred to the National Library. 19 "Jack." K. always addresses Reynolds by his surname, though he calls him "John" on pp. 43 (twice), 51 (twice), 61. Only Clarke is called by his first name (or a nickname) in the letters. "From my window." Holman says that Carisbrooke Castle could not be seen from Canterbury House "except from a modern bay window." Holman thought that K. lodged in a smaller house in Castle Road nearer the Castle from which he could see the latter. The two houses were in 1929 owned by brothers, and Holman supposed that in 1817 Mrs. Cook owned both. 20 In the comment on "some Fairy" (and elsewhere) W. W. Beyer, JEGP , LI (1952), 336 f., sees borrowings from William Sotheby's translation of C. M. Wieland's Oberon , X.11 f. 22 "Old Wood's a very Varmant." Is this a reference to Sir George Wood (1743-1824), who presided at the trial of R. G. Butt for libel ( Examiner , April 27, 1817, p. 272)? Gaynor Bradish suggests that K. had in mind Swift's poem, "Wood an Insect," which pictures William Wood (1671-1730) as an insect with a coat of mail. 25 "150 Miles." The figure is incorrect unless he went to Margate via London. "Heaven, Hues and Prototypes." Compare Acts ii.9 f. "The Maid was fair." Compare Genesis xxiv.16, Esther i.11, ii.7. "Thus endeth." See the rubric of the Prayer Book. "Unsuperfluous lift," "faint Bowers," and "fibrous mould" ( not "roots") are from "The Nymphs" in Leigh Hunt's Foliage (1818), pp. xix, xx, xvii. A copy of that book, by the way, inscribed "John Keats/ from his affectionate friend the Author.—" is in the Houghton Library. 26 "Junkets." According to Milnes, I, 44, "an appellation given him [K.] in play upon his name, and in allusion to his friends of Fairyland." See also Clarke's Recollections of Writers (1878), p. 194. 28 On K.'s reading in Plutarch see J. L. Lowes, PMLA , LI (1936), 1098-1103. 30 K. often uses "feel" as a noun, no doubt encouraged by such phrases as "the blind feel of false Philosophy," "at the feel of Jove," "the feel of sleep" in Hunt's Foliage , pp. v, cxix, 55. On his usage see Woodhouse's comments in KC , I, 64. 33 "The Castle . . . Draw Bridge." He had in mind the Castle Joyeous and Pollente's toll bridge in The Faerie Queene , III.i.31-34, V.ii.4-28. 35 f. "Camel . . . Skyworks." J. L. Lowes, PMLA , LI (1936), 1109 f., says that the camel, Babel, "Ten Storyupinair" are taken from an engraving, "The Building of Babel," in Henry Southwell's (or Robert Sanders') Bible (1773), a copy of which K. owned. 36 "Though I say it as shouldn't say 't." Possibly K. noticed this commonplace in Beaumont and Fletcher's Wit at Several Weapons , II. ii. "Nicolini of the Kings Theatre." David B. Green, NQ , March, 1955, p. 124, suggests that K. took from the Spectator (an edition of which he owned), No. 405, June 14, 1712, this reference to Nicolino Grimaldi (1673-1726), who sang at the King's, later the Haymarket, Theatre. 37 "The Defiance." According to Cary's New Itinerary for 1819, the Defiance left Belle Sauvage, Ludgate Hill, at 7.45 a.m. and reached the Mitre Inn, Oxford, around 3 p.m. 40 No. 21 also has a blurred postmark "MINCHINHAMPTON 10" preceded by a manuscript note "Missent to." 43 "So real a fellow." K. uses "real" to express the highest praise: see pp. 83, 144, 177. 50 "Stummed up." NED defines the verb as "?set going, worked up." Bailey endorsed No. 25: "I think this letter will be a groundwork for a defence of poor Keats's having had Hunt for a Patron .—which is so shamelessly insisted on by the writers of Blackwds. B B—" Also in Taylor's hand, but scratched out, are lines from Hamlet , I.iii.5 f., 9, "As for Hamlet &amp; the trifling of his favour Hold it a fashion &amp; a toy in blood The perfume &amp;c." 56 "Hopkinses and black beetles." Richard Van Fossen notes that Henry John Hopkins matriculated at Magdalen Hall on March 17, 1815, and received the A.B. degree in 1819 (Joseph Foster, Alumni Oxonienses [Oxford, 1888], I, 688), and suggests that "black beetles" is slang for the Oxford beadles. Eric Partridge, A Dictionary of Slang (1949), p. 58, defines "black beetles" as "the lower classes." 58 Bailey endorsed No. 28, "Respecting Hunt's Conduct to Keats—" If K. actually wrote No. 28 on Monday, November 3, 1817, he waited two days to post it. The paragraph beginning "Yesterday Rice" (p. 61) may well have been a November 4 continuation. 61 Two longer "advertisements" to "Z." appeared in the Examiner , November 16, December 14, 1817, pp. 729, 788. "Z." replied to Hunt in Blackwood's , January, 1818 (II, 414-417), refusing to give his name and indulging in further abuse. 63 The Wednesday in November, 1817, on which K. wrote No. 29 was November 5, 12, or 19. He was at Burford Bridge on November 26. No. 30 should follow No. 31, as Lowell, I, 446 f., showed long ago. No. 31 was written either on November 21 or else in the late morning or early afternoon of November 22, 1817 ("I am just arrived at Dorking"), and was postmarked at Leatherhead, the post town some three miles distant. No. 30 was written late at night on the 22nd after K. "went up Box hill this Evening . . . came down—and wrote some lines" of Endymion . Lowell was puzzled by the postmarks attributed to No. 30. She did not realize that it is printed from a transcript by Woodhouse, who gave the date of writing "(Leatherhead 22 d Nov r 1817)." K. actually was staying at Burford Bridge (see the postscript to No. 31), and No. 30 was probably mailed at Leatherhead, some three miles away, on November 23. 64 "Soothly to sain." Compare "sooth to sayne" in Troilus and Criseyde , III.430, and The Shepherd's Calendar , "May," line 158. 65 The "advertizement . . . to Poets" appeared in the Chronicle on November 20, p. 2. Reynolds did not "lack" poems because he was in charge of the poetry department of the Champion . 66 Bailey endorsed No. 31, "Extracts from this letter might be made with great credit to the &lt;poor&gt; unfortunate writer's memory. BB." All Bailey's endorsements were designed for Taylor's use in his proposed biography of K. 67 "To compare great things with small." See Paradise Lost , II.921 f., X.306; Paradise Regained , IV.563 f. 69 K. says that he stayed in town to meet Christie at Reynolds', presumably on or about November 21. He fails to say that (according to William Godwin's diary, as Mr. Lewis Patton tells me) he dined at Shelley's with Hunt and Godwin on November 18. He may have begun No. 32 earlier than December 21, 1817, for Jeffrey's transcript omits some words (possibly even a page) after the first sentence, an omission that J. G. Speed, editing the letters in 1883, p. 7, duplicated. At any rate, the second sentence of the letter as transcribed was written in the morning or afternoon of December 21, the sentence beginning "I have had two" late at night, presumably also on December 21. Kean was absent from Drury Lane for several weeks in November and December. The playbill for December 8 mentions his "continued and severe indisposition." See K.'s words on p. 113 about "poor Kean." 70 "Riches." In his diary Godwin (so Mr. Patton tells me) notes that at Riches he saw Lamb, Talfourd, and K. "Lord Ellenborough . . . his own coin." According to Lord Campbell, The Lives of the Chief Justices , III (1857), 225, Ellenborough presided at the second and third trials, December 19, 20, 1817, of Hone for publishing scandalous libels (K. is referring to the third as reported in the Examiner , December 21, pp. 806 f.), and the jury's verdict of not guilty "was followed by a tremendous burst of applause, which he could not even attempt to quell," while it was popularly believed that he "was killed by Hone's trial, and he certainly never held up his head in public after." Horace and James Smith are still well known; their brother was Leonard (1778-1837). Thomas Jonathan Wooler (1786?-1853), editor of the Black Dwarf (1817-1824), had been tried before another judge on June 5 for libeling the ministry, and was acquitted ( Examiner , June 8, pp. 361, 366-368). 71 f. "Christmas pantomime." K. probably saw the first performance, December 26, 1817, of Harlequin's Vision . If he went to the second, December 27, then this part of the letter was written on December 28 before he attended Haydon's "immortal dinner" (pp. 74 f.). K. probably learned about Shelley's difficulty with Laon and Cythna from Godwin, who notes in his diary for December 25, 1817 (so Mr. Patton tells me), "Meet Keats." For "Sooth la!" see Antony and Cleopatra , IV.iv.8. For a discussion of how K. met Wordsworth at Monkhouse's around December 15, 1817, see T.O. Mabbott, NQ , May 10, 1941, pp. 328 f. "The Penetralium of mystery." Garrod, K. (Oxford, 1926), p. 33 n., has "tried to believe that Keats knew better" and wrote "Penetralia." But what may be believed of R.M. Milnes, who (II, 52) speaks of the poet's "access to that inmost penetralium of Fame"? 74 "Wordsworth . . . his Daughter." Kathleen Coburn, The Letters of Sara Hutchinson (1954), p. 114 n., thinks that K. saw Wordsworth, Mrs. Wordsworth, and Miss Hutchinson. Dora Wordsworth was at the time with her aunt, Dorothy, at Rydal Mount. On Joseph Ritchie see Annals of Philosophy , July, 1818 (XII, 72 f.), and particularly Captain George Francis Lyon, A Narrative of Travels in Northern Africa, in the Years 1818, 19, and 20 (1821). 75 "Bob Harris in the Slips." The slips are the sidings from which scenery was pushed on the stage. Thomas Harris, chief proprietor and manager of Covent Garden for many years, died on October 1, 1820. Whether Bob Harris was related to him I do not know. K. calls Bologna a middling Harlequin," but the European Magazine , January, 1817 (LXXI, 64) says that he is "decidedly our best Harlequin." 76 "Loveless . . . affraid it is gone." W. J. Bate suggests that the reference is to Loveless, the rake-hero of Colley Cibber's Love's Last Shift (1696) or its sequel, Sir John Vanbrugh's Relapse (1696), which was rewritten as Sheridan's Trip to Scarborough (1777). 78 In No. 36 * the name "Bewick" is heavily scratched out. As the same thing is true of "Bewick" in No. 59, one might suppose the canceler to have been Haydon's son, Frederic Wordsworth Haydon. 79 "In town two days." If the first sentence of No. 40 is to be taken literally, K. returned home on the night of January 12, 1818. With "uproar's your only music" compare K.'s "How many bards," line 14, "pleasing music, and not wild uproar." 81 Because K. asked his sister on February 27, 1819 (p. 283), "to teach me a few common dancing steps," his biographers assume that at least up to that time he could not dance. He went to dances three times in January, 1818 (pp. 76, 81), on February 19, 1819 (pp. 285, 296), and on January 11, 1820 (p. 449). A non-dancer could hardly have seen that Rice danced "as if he was deaf" (p. 76) or have expressed an intention of not leaving Scotland "without having got the Highland fling" (p. 162). Instead of "Brown is returned from Hampstead" K. should have written "to Hampstead" or "from Hampshire," since Brown (see p. 75) was apparently at Bedhampton. 84 " Milton's Hair ." On Hunt's "Collection of Locks of Hair" see Blunden, Leigh Hunt (1930), pp. 368-373. The Milton lock is now in the University of Texas Library. 85 "Your Sermon." A Discourse Inscribed to the Memory of the Princess Charlotte Augusta , published anonymously by Taylor and Hessey, 1817. It was praised by Coleridge and was reviewed by Dilke in the Champion , March 22, 1818 ( KC , I, 8, 10, 20). 86 "What hindered me from writing so long." Yet he had finished and presumably mailed No. 37 to them only four or five days before. Compare the first sentence of No. 50. 87 "But who's afraid? . . . demme if I am." David B. Green reminds me that this is a quotation (repeated on p. 113) from the part of Horace Smith's Nehemiah Muggs that K. copied, "Pooh! Nonsense! damme! who's afraid?" (see p. 100 n.). 89 "Scott." The reference cannot be to Sir Walter. Hunt and John Scott had waged a bitter war about Byron in the Champion and the Examiner during 1816. Naturally Hunt suspected his old enemy (whom Tom K. had met in Paris) of having written the Cockney School attacks. John Scott wrote to the publisher, Robert Baldwin, so Elmer Brooks tells me, January 24, 1819, of having seen two issues of Blackwood's : "I sent to England for them because some one had said (I was told) that I had written the scandalous articles on Mr. Hunt! Articles I read with disgust and abhorrence." Haydon at first thought that "Z." was Daniel Terry (1780?-1829), playwright, and next Christopher North (Huxley, I, 265, 290). 91 "As the old song says." Perhaps a reference to Isaac Watts's "Innocent Play" in his Divine Songs . . . for the Use of Children , Song 2 ( Poetical Works , III [1807], 90), "But Thomas and William, and such pretty names,/ Should be cleanly, and harmless, as doves, or as lambs,/ Those lovely sweet innocent creatures." "Sigh . . . sigh." Woodhouse and Garrod, K.'s Poetical Works (Oxford, 1939), p. 542, interpret the word as a cockneyism for "say." 97 "The Mermaid lines." E. F. Madden, Harper's New Monthly Magazine , LV (1877), 361, has the following important comments based on a now lost letter of K.: "He [K.] alludes to an evening at the 'Mermaid' with Horace Twiss and Horace Smith, saying their being together at this place revived thoughts of Ben Jonson, Fletcher, Beaumont, and others who used to assemble there in days of yore. Upon the occasion in question Keats composed the lines commencing, "'Souls of poets dead and gone . . . . "'Reynolds, Dilke and others,' says Keats, 'were pleased with this beyond any thing I ever did.' In this letter Keats alludes to the fondness of Twiss for repeating extempore verses—written, however, at home—and incloses a very clever take-off on him and his verses by Horace Smith." 101 "A sheet of Endymion." This remark indicates that, once again, Jeffrey made large omissions from a letter written on more than one day. When K. began it, the printers had done nothing on Endymion , and he was anticipating an indefinite delay; before he finished it, he had seen one printed sheet, and he thought that the printers would soon have the entire poem set up. 104 "By not writing." Actually he had written No. 47 just seven days or less (see the preceding note) before. Compare the odd apology with which he begins No. 41. 105 Wilkie's "Bathsheba" was also condemned in the Examiner , February 15, 1818, p. 107, but the New Monthly Magazine , March, 1818 (IX, 156), said that it was "calculated greatly to aggrandize his fame." K. actually wrote "Leslie's Uriel," confusing the pupil with his teacher (see K-SJ , I [1952], 38). "Uriel in the Sun," impressively reproduced as Plate XLI in E. P. Richardson's Washington Allston (Chicago, 1948), now belongs to Harvard's Fogg Museum, where it reposes ignominiously in storage. In a passage Jeffrey omits in No. 50 "Le Mesurier's image" is mentioned. I observe that one Isaac Lemesurier, aged 53, died at Edmonton in July, 1818 ( Monthly Magazine, August [XLVI, 79]). 106 "I have not seen Hunt since." Perhaps he meant to write "since January 21" (p. 84). Instead of a "new Poem" Scott published The Heart of Midlothian in the following June. 108 "13 Line Page 32" of the printed Endymion shows no change from K.'s own manuscript. See Garrod, K.'s Poetical Works (Oxford, 1939), p. lxxxvi. 112 "Tom desires to be remember'd." But Bailey did not know Tom: see KC , II, 279. 113 "Lodgment . . . glacis." Norman Holland observes that these military terms were suggested by Tristram Shandy . Compare "giving such clear ideas of the differences and distinctions between the scarp and counterscarp,—the glacis and covered way,—the half-moon and ravelin" (Vol. II, chapter 1); "the talus of the glacis" (VI, 21); "When the duke of Marlborough made a lodgment,—my uncle Toby made a lodgment too" (VI, 22); "[The morning] was that of the storm of the counterscarp" (VI, 24). 118 "Damn me if I shoul'nt like him to damn me." The first three words were scratched out apparently by K. They were, accordingly, omitted by Haydon when he transcribed the letter in his autobiography (Huxley, I, 277), but he and F. W. Haydon, II, 9, printed "I should like him to damn me." The deletion completely changes the meaning of the sentence: K., who admired the vitriolic letter to Gifford, would hardly have wished to be similarly damned. 119 "When I die I'll have." After "have" about six lines are heavily scratched out. All I can read is "Lear placed on my head, Macbeth in my hand, othello on my heart, Romeo &amp; Juliet on my lips and be covered up with the others, &amp; the Midsummer dream on one side of my head[?] &amp; the Tempest on the other." They are ignored by F. W. Haydon, II, 9 f., whose changes in the letters he prints are surprising. "Haslitt . . . Crown &amp; Anchor." Howe, The Life of William Hazlitt (1922), p. 250, says, "This proposal did not eventuate." In the revised edition (1947), p. 227, the sentence reads, "This proposal eventuated in April." The Examiner , March 29, p. 201, announced that Hazlitt "is now re-delivering [the lectures] at the Crown and Anchor." 120 "A ramance is a fine thing." Woodhouse notes, "It had been suggested that a romance was an improper title for the book" ( Endymion ). 121 As for Salmasius' "unhappy end" Walter Mac Kellar, The Latin Poems of John Milton (New Haven, 1930), pp. 41 f., remarks: "The general success of Milton's Defense . . . reduced Salmasius to utter chagrin, cost him the favor of the Queen [Christina of Sweden], and so undermined his health that he shortly died." From the inscription in Guzman d' Alfarache (1634), "John Keats From his Friend J s Rxxx 20 th April 1818," Holman believed that Rice spent the week-end of April 18-20 with K. at Teignmouth, and from him Lowell, I, 616-618, took over the idea. 124 Colvin, editing K.'s Letters (1891), p. 91 n., says that K. could only have seen an engraving of Claude's "Enchanted Castle" by François Vivarès and William Woollett. Hewlett, A Life of John K. (1949), p. 156, adds that the picture was in William Wells's home, Redleaf, near Sevenoaks, Kent. 135 "An awful while." Only eighteen days, but compare the apologies for dilatory writing on pp. 72, 86. 139 For attempted explanations of "pip-civilian" see J. M. Murry and Roberta D. Cornelius in TLS , July 9, August 6, 1938, pp. 466, 520. 141 "Fly the garter." "A game," says NED , citing this as the first of two examples, "in which the players leap from one side of a 'garter' or line of stones over the back of one of their number." 142 "Chequer works . . . a Milkmaid." Perhaps he was thinking of "the Milkmaid singeth blithe" and "Dancing in the Chequer'd shade" of "L'Allegro," lines 65, 96. 144 "Moore's present . . . is real." Howe, The Life of William Hazlitt (1947), pp. 227 f., thought that K. referred to The Fudge Family , a copy of which (3d ed., 1818) on April 27, 1818, Thomas Moore inscribed to Hazlitt "as a small mark of respect for his literary talents &amp; political principles." It was small indeed, not "real" in the sense in which K. (pp. 43, 83, 177) used the word. When he wrote this sentence K. had not met Moore (p. 251), and, as Holman acutely noted, K. and Reynolds could hardly have known of his gift of a book six days after it was made, particularly since Reynolds was ill in London, K. a visitor in Teignmouth. Hazlitt disliked and disparaged Moore (see P. G. Patmore, My Friends and Acquaintance , III [1854], 136-138), while Moore was far too poor to make a "real" present. Holman is certainly correct in thinking the present a gift of money and the giver Peter Moore (1753-1828), M.P., one of the managers of Drury Lane, a rich man who patronized Sheridan. K. would almost inevitably have seen Peter Moore "at the Theatre just before I left Town." 149 In the Hampstead K. (New York, 1938), I, lxxxv, Naomi Kirk says that George K. married on June 4, 1818 (see also p. xxxiii). June 4 seems impossible, for writing here on that very day K. says that the marriage took place "a Week ago," that is, about May 28. 150 On No. 69 Bailey wrote: "There is so much amiable feeling &amp; tenderness in this that I think it might be printed entire, or very copious extracts made from it. B B." He also put a brace in the margin to call attention to the striking sentence ending "dying for a great human purpose." 153-209 The letters on the tour of Scotland cannot be fully understood without consulting Brown's journal ("Walks in the North," Plymouth and Devonport Weekly Journal , October 1, 8, 15, 22, 1840) and Nelson S. Bushnell's A Walk after John K . (New York, 1936). Both supply essential dates and other facts. 164 "Richard Bradshaw." Brown calls him Richard Radshaw, and gives many picturesque details about him. 170 "I have missed a day from fanny's Letter." Bushnell, p. 282, explains, "Because he had written her on the evening of the third in Kirkcudbright [see p. 166], and again on the morning of the fifth at Newton Stewart" (see p. 169). K. missed July 4 in both Nos. 74 and 75. 171 "Some Ruins." That is, of Glenluce Abbey (1190), a mile and a half northwest on Luce Water. 173 "Squab and lean." "Squab" means short and stout. Probably K. intended to repeat "squat" (pp. 82, 171). 174 n. Lowell is credited with saying that Bailey's and K.'s signatures appear in "the visitors' book of Holy Trinity Church," Stratford-on-Avon, October 2, 1817. She merely followed Colvin, John Keats (1920), p. 150, who presumably had seen the book. 175 "His rigs of Barley." The refrain of Burns's "It was upon a Lammas night." 176 "'A curious old Bitch'." The phrase reminds one of James Humphry, a Mauchline mason (died 1844), who often referred to himself as "Burns's blethering bitch" (see DeLancey Ferguson, Pride and Passion [New York, 1939], p. 85). 179 "It wont do." See the same words on pp. 249, 386. Here they mean that Dilke at a glance will see that the poem is not a genuine folk-song. "27 Miles from Stranraer." Presumably he means twenty-seven miles from Portpatrick, via Stranraer and Cairn Ryan to Ballantrae. At this point, unhappily, Brown's journal ends, for reasons he gives in KC , II, 38. 181 "Two Ruins." Robert Heron, Observations Made in a Journey through the Western Counties of Scotland (Perth, 1793), II, 326 f., says that the "ruinous castle of Baltersan . . . standing near [to Maybole], I should suppose to have been a palace for the abbots" of Crossraguel Abbey. 182 "Kean . . . at Glasgow." According to Giles Playfair's Kean (New York, 1939), pp. 137, 152, Kean acted at Glasgow every night in Holy Week, 1815. 183 Oddly enough No. 78 was in the possession of Severn, who on October 6, 1845 ( KC , II, 131 f.), offered to send it to Milnes. The latter accepted the offer, and had a copy made which is now in the Harvard K. Collection. 187 K. says that The Stranger "has been scoffed at lately almost to a fashion." Mrs. Clement Parsons, The Incomparable Siddons (1909), pp. 156-158, observes that, though Mrs. Siddons played in it twenty-six times in 1798, the "British critics, to a man, fell upon the play." K. probably knew the parody by James Smith in Rejected Addresses (1812) and Reynolds' characterization, in the Champion , March 2, 1817, of the play as "among the worst" specimens of German drama. Yet the European Magazine (LXIX, 445) gave great praise to performances in May, 1816, and later, May, 1818 (LXXIII, 432), attacked it only on moral grounds. 190 No. 79 has in the address not "T. Bailey" but "I. Bailey" (died 1822), who lived at Thornley Abbey, near Peterborough. It was probably John Bailey's hand that forwarded this misaddressed letter to his newly ordained son. 196 No. 80 was printed in part by J. F. Clarke in the Louisville Western Messenger , July, 1836 (I, 820-823). Clarke, p. 773, thought K.'s letters "of a higher order of composition than his poems." Burns gave K. the word "sax" for "six." 207 In No. 82 Mrs. Wylie's address is given (by John Jeffrey) as Henrietta Street. Her sister, Mrs. Millar, had that address; Mrs. Wylie lived in Romney Street. 208 The "Jessy" reference is just as likely to be to R. A. Smith's "Jessie the Flow'r o' Dumblane, a favorite Scottish Song," which the European Magazine , January, 1816 (LXIX, 49 f.), reviewing the fourth edition, said "has obtained more popularity than any other [song] that has appeared for a considerable time." 218 Since No. 87 * is endorsed by Tom, that unfortunate boy must have read the ominous comments therein made on him. 219 "Vincent." Holman notes that Grant Richards, in his Author Hunting (1934), p. 25, says that K. meant Vincent Novello, adding, "But K. would not be calling him by his Christian name." 220 f. Colvin, editing K.'s Letters (1891), p. 167 n., identified J. S. as John Scott. Lowell, II, 89, denied the identification because Scott "was still abroad" in October, 1818. Actually Scott's journal, partly printed in his Sketches of Manners (1821), shows (p. 166) that he was in England and that he first reached Calais on November 23. 222 "The Tale." Gittings, John K . (1954), p. 23, thinks the reference is to a prose tale of St. Agnes' Eve which K. proposed to base on Boccaccio, and which he told George on October 16 (p. 237) he was about to begin. See also p. 252. J. M. Murry, K . (1955), pp. 139 f., rejects these ideas, and declares that Reynolds "was almost certainly referring to Isabella ." 230 Henry Wylie appears to have lived with his aunt, Mrs. Millar, in Henrietta Street. 231 "Coming the Richardson." W. J. Bate suggests "becoming," that is, coming to be like Richardson, who rakes and rummages (p. 433), makes mountains out of molehills (p. 408), and with self-satisfaction (p. 318) gives gossipy accounts of social and especially amorous intrigue. 233 "Notwithstand." K. uses this obsolete variant of "notwithstanding" again on pp. 239, 394. 248 K. called Payne's Brutus "very bad." Yet it was produced on December 3 with (as the next night's program says) "the most unbounded and rapturous approbation." At the December 4 performance it "experienced a reception even surpassing those torrents of loud and rapturous approbation." A smash hit, it was also given on December 5, 7-12, 14-19, 21-23 (after which Kean left for the provinces), January 13-16, 18-23, 25-29, February 1-4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (forty-one nights). Then after Miss Porter's Switzerland (p. 297) failed, it was presented again on February 16, 18, 20, March 1. Payne got £183 for the play, while Drury Lane made £10,000 (J. F. Molloy, The Life . . . of Edmund Kean , II [1888], 47). 251 f. Alan Strout reminds me that Blackwood's , May, 1818 (III, 162-168), reviewed a Rodwell and Martin edition of Walpole's letters to George Montagu, and suggests that Martin owned the single letter of Walpole's that was printed in the October and Walpole's nine letters printed in the November issues (IV, 40 f., pp. 148-155). 255 "His first engraving." In Louisville George K. had a "miniature of a dog by H y Wylie in mezzotinto" (Rollins, More Letters [Cambridge, Mass., 1955], p. 24). 256 "Scott . . . the scotch novels." He means Scott and Byron as poets and then Scott as a novelist. He had surely read in the Examiner , May 17, 1818, p. 313, the statement that Scott's "secret . . . is no longer kept." 266 "African Kingdom." Summaries of T. E. Bowdich's "mission" to Ashantee are given in the Annals of Philosophy , January, 1818 (XI, 9-13), and the Gentleman's Magazine , December, 1818 (LXXXVIII, ii, 556), but, like his book, they differ from K.'s account. Sarah Wallis Bowdich (1791-1856), afterwards Mrs. Robert Lee, herself a popular author, is not mentioned in Bowdich's Mission (1819). 270 On Monday, December 21, 1818, K. went to Walthamstow in the morning and then dined with Haydon (pp. 254 f.), and so the Tuesday on which he wrote No. 101 seems likely to have been December 15. On December 14 he had called on Mrs. Wylie, Mrs. Millar, Hazlitt, and presumably Mrs. Reynolds (pp. 246, 248). 271 "Salmon." "Sammons, my model," "my old corporal," who "was 6 feet 3 inches tall" (Huxley, I, 143, 217, 281). 279 Mr. Gittings (who has published interesting details about the persons named in this letter) suggests to me that the "girls in Havant" were the daughters of Mat Snook, a cousin of John Snook. He also tells me that John Blagden was a former mayor of Chichester, who in 1819 was a bankrupt. 283 "Always pay the postage." Yet in writing to Fanny K. he paid the postage only on this letter and No. 135. 285 "Our Brother in laws' cousin's." The phrase proves that Mrs. Wylie and Mrs. Millar were sisters. K. heard of Miss Millar's dance on December 14, 1818 (p. 248). See also p. 296. 287 Perhaps the "dreadful fire" was that of March 8 mentioned in the Examiner , March 14, p. 176. No. 118 has endorsements by Severn, F. R. Franz, and Locker Lampson. The last also put his autograph on other letters, as Nos. 163, 168, 239. 292 Among sums owing to K. but not repaid were, according to George (Rollins, More Letters , p. 28), £40 or £50 loaned to Wilkinson (see p. 18). 293 "Birkbeck's sons." Morris Birkbeck had four sons and three daughters. Perhaps the reference here is to the eldest son Richard (born 1795), who married at Albion, Illinois, in 1820 or 1821. See Robert Birkbeck, The Birkbecks of Westmorland (privately printed, 1900), pp. 101 f. 295 With the mock leave-taking at the end of No. 122 compare K.'s words on p. 420. 304 Kean acted Hotspur in 1 Henry IV (Stephen Kemble was Falstaff) at Drury Lane on March 9, 11 (when K. was in town), and April 30, and, said the Examiner , March 13, p. 170, disappointed everybody. March 11, which K. called "stifling," actually had cloudy weather with temperatures ranging from 41° to 48°. 306 "That sweet sleep." See Othello , III.iii.332. 313 Hodgkinson was certainly alive and prosperous in May, 1826 ( KC , I, 299 f.). 323 "Playing young gooseberry." The usual phrase is "playing old gooseberry," that is, making havoc with. 324 Eric Partridge, A Dictionary of Slang (1949), throws light on K.'s slang, as "Tom"gin, and "ruin blue"gin of poor quality. 325 On K.'s dream see Elizabeth Schneider, Coleridge, Opium, and "Kubla Khan" (Chicago, 1953), pp. 50 f. 327 Sara Hutchinson, Letters , ed. Kathleen Coburn (1954), p. 154, says of Reynolds' parody: "Some People attribute the latter to H. Smith. . . . but I believe it is Hazlitt (tho W m says H. could not write anything so foolish) because there are some expressions &amp; rhymes, in the extracts which we have seen, that occur only in Peter Bell which Hazlitt saw many years ago. . . . The false one is very stupid, but I have no doubt that it has helped the sale of the true one." In K.'s printed review Barbara Lewthwaite, the heroine of Wordsworth's "Pet Lamb," is not mentioned. 328 "A new dull and half damn'd Opera." But The Heart of Midlothian was presented on April 17, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 29—sixteen times by June 12. Henry Barker's panorama, "representing the north coast of Spitzbergen," was advertised in The Times for April 19, the day on which K. visited it. 341 After finishing this long letter on May 3 K. presumably called on his sister. See p. 295, the conclusion of No. 122, which was written on May 1, not April 17. 343 "Your Honiton Letter." Evidently Sarah Jeffrey accompanied K. and Tom in the chaise to Honiton, and then wrote them a note after their departure for Bridport and London. Observe that in writing to her mother No. 65 (which Sarah may have carried back) K. mentioned only Marian and Fanny Jeffrey, and that No. 128, obviously to Sarah, ends, "I shall ever remember our leave-taking with you ." Later K. described the Jeffreys, in whose house he and Tom had lodged, as "some Acquaintances" (p. 347). That there was (p. lvi) a fourth Jeffrey girl is altogether unlikely. 346 Fairly close to K.'s Boiardo anecdote is this passage from Leigh Hunt's Stories from the Italian Poets (New York, 1846), pp. 239 f.: "There is said to have been a tradition at Scandiano, that having tried in vain one day, as he was riding out, to discover a name for one of his heroes, expressive of his lofty character, and the word Rodamonte coming into his head, he galloped back with a pleasant ostentation to his castle, crying it out aloud, and ordering the bells of the place to be rung in its honour; to the astonishment of the good people." E. H. Wilkins tells me that Hunt followed some such source as Giovanni Maria Mazzuchelli's Gli scrittori d' Italia (Brescia, 1753), II, iii, 1438, and adds: "Keats perhaps heard the story from Hunt, but he might have heard it from W. S. Rose or T. J. Mathias or some other English man of letters interested in Italian literature." 355 In the address of No. 136 everything after "Miss Brawne" is printed, as if K. wished to disguise his handwriting. A postmark shows that he prepaid the postage. 363 On K.'s idea of "introducing an Elephant" into Otho see the comments in M. W. Disher's Greatest Show on Earth (1937), p. 78. 371 Naturally puzzled, even affronted, by No. 144, Taylor forwarded it to Woodhouse, who copied part of it in his letter-book, and then wrote a long explanation of it to Taylor on August 31 ( KC , I, 81-85). 375 "A gimlet through my Ears." Compare K.'s sonnet, "The House of Mourning," lines 11 f. 376 On K.'s lodgings and walks in Winchester see W. C. Forman, Cornhill Magazine , n.s., L (1921), 144-146. 379 f. K.'s harangue on climate, agriculture, and the Chinese follows, says H. E. Briggs, PMLA , LIX (1944), 596-598, Robertson's History of America (Dublin, 1777), I, 343-345, and Hazlitt's essay "On Manner" in The Round Table , I (1817), 111-124. 382 "Brown . . . three weeks." Brown's son wrote in 1890 ( KC , I, lvi): "In August 1819, when Brown left Keats at Winchester, he went over to Ireland and married Abigail Donohoo," and K.'s biographers usually change "August" to "September" and accept his words. But Brown left Winchester sometime after September 5, he was certainly in Bedhampton when K. played his practical joke on Benjamin early in September (pp. 427 f.), he received four letters at Chichester from K. on September 23 (p. 425), and he was apparently back at Winchester before October 1 (p. 431), certainly by October 3 (p. 434). See Brown's Life of John K. , ed. Dorothy Bodurtha and Willard B. Pope (1937), p. 108. 386 "You'll pardon me for being jocular." H. E. Briggs, MLN , LIX (1944), 572, notes that Master Vellum (see p. 26) says this three times in Addison's Drummer . 389 "Line of circumvallation." K. remembered "The lines of circumvallation" in Annals of the Fine Arts , I (1817), 263 n. 391 Sir Herbert Warren, Nineteenth Century , XCIII (1923), 65 n., says that "peroccupatus" "would be an excellent word if only . . . [it] were Latin." 400 "I dined with your Mother . . . in Henrietta Street." That is, in Mrs. Millar's home (see the note on p. 207). On pp. 419 f. K. again tells of dining with the Wylies at Mrs. Millar's house. The Millars, as usual on such occasions, were away, this time "at old M rs So and So's who was like to die ." 405 Cantos I and II of Don Juan were published in July, 1819, with the names of author and publisher omitted. Abbey read to K. Canto I, stanza 218, possibly from the Monthly Review , LXXXIX (1819), 317. Holman thought that "the coffee-german'" was only another name for Hodgkinson. 407 "Manchester . . . Hunt's." On Henry Hunt's triumphal entry into London on September 13 (after the Peterloo Massacre of August 16, 1819) see the Monthly Magazine , XLVIII (1819), 280. 413 n. In connection with the 1820 review of K. in the Edinburgh it is worth remembering that on July 13, 1820 (see The Times , October 30, 1928, p. 19), Reynolds wrote to Jeffrey, tactfully urging him to notice the Lamia volume. 421 K.'s remark, "seven years ago it was not this hand that clench'd itself against Hammond" cannot point "to an early stage in the rupture" with Hammond. "Seven years ago," September, 1812, he had been with Hammond a year, and he stayed three further years. Incidentally, Mrs. Thomas Hammond died at Edmonton in July, 1817 ( Monthly Magazine , XLIV [1817], 84). 422 "A relation of the Bishop of Winchester." That is, Francis North (1772-1861), sixth Earl of Guildford, master of St. Cross, son of Brownlow North (1741-1820), bishop of Winchester. See W. C. Forman, Cornhill Magazine , n.s., L (1921), 145. 425 "A misunderstand." NED cites only George Meredith, 1864, for this noun. But K. loved to use verbs, like "harass" and "feel," as substantives. 426 K. could not remember what he did on May 1, 1819, but at least on that day he wrote No. 122 to his sister, and the Dilkes dined with him and Brown. 427 On the strike of the Manchester and Selford weavers see the Monthly Magazine , September, October, 1818 (XLVI, 186, 280). 435 "Ah hertè mine!" Often in Troilus and Criseyde , as IV.1214, 1216, V.939. 438 f. The hurry in which K. wrote No. 165 and the leisureliness of No. 166 would suggest that their order be reversed were it not that their postmarks (not reproduced in any of the editions) show No. 165 to have been stamped at noon, No. 166 at 7 p.m. 440 "From Holl and." Perhaps K. intended "Holland." Two attorneys named Charles Holland are listed in the directories. "Frank M. Citing." The name, David B. Green tells me, actually is Frank M. Etting. Colonel Etting (1833-1890) willed his collection of autographs and other manuscripts, about 20,000 items, to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Edgartown, Massachusetts, by the way, was long the home port of Arctic whaling ships. 450 It is worth noting that the world premiere of Otho was at St. Martin's Theatre, London, November 2, 1950, with Robin Bailey as Ludolph. "George . . . to the play." They saw The Comedy of Errors at Covent Garden, January 10, a night in which Drury Lane presented an opera, The Siege of Belgrade . 453 "I can see nothing but dullness." These comments resemble the conclusion to Shelley's Peter Bell the Third , the manuscript of which Leigh Hunt received at the end of 1819. 466 The incident of K.'s forgetting to ask the hungry, tired Reynolds to stay for lunch is reproduced, says R. F. Rashbrook, NQ , November 13, 1948, p. 499, in K.'s sonnet, "The House of Mourning," "want of cheer/ After a walk up hill to a friend's cot." 468 H. B. Forman suggested that No. 187, like Nos. 213, 214, 223, was addressed to Mrs. Brawne because of "a sensitiveness to observation from any unaccustomed quarter." Annotating that comment, James Russell Lowell wrote: "I believe it rather one of those archaisms of which K. was overfond. How if he were playing with a fancy of Mrs Anne Page?" Lowell might also have cited Mrs . Joanna Baillie. 472 In connection with the references to Rousseau, it should be noted that K. owned a copy of La nouvelle Héloïse ( KC , I, 259). "Thank God I am born in England," etc. Perhaps these insular remarks were influenced by Wordsworth's sonnet "Great Men," in which France is said to have "equally a want of books and men." 484 "All the Letters are on one side." In September, 1819 ( KC , I, 94), Woodhouse said of writing letters to K.: "I promised amendment, &amp; stipulated (as Paddy says) 'that all the reciprocity should not be on one side.'" 489 K.'s "pleasantry about not dating" No. 215 "from such a place as this" really concerns, not the date, but the street-name "Wesleyan Place." 507 No. 227 could scarcely have a postmark as it was carried by the Gisbornes (see Leigh Hunt's Correspondence , I [1862], 158). They sailed from Dover to Calais on September 3 and reached Leghorn about October 10 (F. L. Jones, Maria Gisborne [Norman, Oklahoma, 1951], p. 9). 508 "Advising me not to publish." According to N. I. White, Shelley (New York, 1940), I, 504, Shelley gave this advice in 1817 but "helped him to print his volume after advising against it." 509 "At my lunes." See The Merry Wives of Windsor , IV.ii.21, and The Winter's Tale , II.ii.80. 510 "I am indicating," etc. Evidently a pun on the Indicator , which on August 2 and 9 had been devoted solely to glowing comments on the Lamia volume but on August 16 contained only a very dull fairy tale. The reference in No. 231 to "my Lodgings" is to 2 Wesleyan Place, where at least for a time K.'s books and other belongings remained after he had moved into Hunt's home. Certainly he would not have called the Hunts (or later the Brawnes) "thieves." 511 "My Taylor." K. owed him £30 or £40, which George ordered Abbey to pay in 1825 (Rollins, More Letters , pp. 26, 28). 523 "Care Giovanni." Was this the courier mentioned on p. 526? 527 It is somewhat misleading to say that K. had a letter of introduction from Sir Thomas Lawrence to Canova. Sharp, The Life . . . of Joseph Severn (1892), pp. 48, 50, says that Lawrence gave a letter to Severn. 529 K. and Severn went ashore at Naples, not on November 1 (see p. xxxii), but on October 31, when K.'s passport was registered. The passport (now at Harvard) was viséed at the British Legation on November 6 and by the Papal Consulate General on November 7. Hence K. and Severn must have started for Rome on November 7 or 8. They reached Rome, not on November 17 (p. xxxii), but certainly by November 15, on which date (see the Bulletin of the Keats-Shelley Memorial Rome , No. 2 [1913], pp. 94 f.) Prince Torlonia's bank paid K. (or Severn) 92 scudi on his draft against Taylor and Hessey. It is of interest that Henry Matthews ( The Diary of an Invalid , 2nd ed. [1820], pp. 167-169) left Rome by carriage before daybreak on February 9, 1818, spent the night at Terracina, and reached Naples after dark on February 10. On the return trip (pp. 227 f.) he left Naples on April 5, slept at Capua, spent the night of April 6 at Velletri, and reached Rome in time for breakfast the next morning. 531 No. 242 took exactly three weeks to reach Brown, whose reply, No. 242 *, took almost as much time, reaching Rome, as an omitted postmark shows, on "9 Gennaio."</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Colburn-Bentley and the March of Intellect by Royal A. Gettmann</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE AIM OF THE PRESENT PAPER IS TO DESCRIBE the venture of Colburn and Bentley into the field of the cheap series. This was a significant episode in the history of the House of Bentley, and an account of it will also shed some light on an important phase of nineteenth-century British publishing. The original impulse for the numerous, inexpensive series which appeared in the late 1820's was provided by the planning and the actual example of Archibald Constable, that restless and audacious publisher of Edinburgh, the then capital of English and even European book making. In Constable's project, as in so many aspects of publishing during this period, there was the influence of Scott. The inception of Constable's Miscellany is described in a well-known passage of Lockhart's Life but one so vivid that it would be a pity not to quote from it. But at this time [1825] the chief subject of concern was a grand scheme of revolution in the whole art and traffic of publishing, which Constable first opened in detail one Saturday at Abbotsford — none being present except Sir Walter, Ballantyne, and myself. After dinner, there was a little pause of expectation, and the brave schemer started in medias res , saying:-"Literary genius may, or may not, have done its best; but the trade are in the cradle." Scott eyed the florid bookseller's beaming countenance, and the solemn stare with which the equally portly printer was listening, and pushing round the bottles with a hearty chuckle, bade me "Give our twa soncie babbies a drap mother's milk." Constable then drew from his pocket a copy of the annual schedule of taxes and, after pointing out the number of persons who were evidently owners of racers, four-wheeled carriages, and other luxuries, he asserted that the upper classes were not buying books. Scott helped him on by interposing, that at that moment he had a rich valley crowded with handsome houses under his view, and yet much doubted whether any laird within ten miles spent ten pounds per annum on the literature of the day. "No," said Constable, "there is no market among them that's worth one's thinking about. . . 1 But if I live for half-a-dozen years, I'll make it as impossible that there should not be a good library in every decent house in Britain as that the shepherd's ingle-nook should want the saut poke . Ay, and what's that?" he continued, warming and puffing; "why should the ingle-nook itself want a shelf for the novels ?" . . . "Troth," says Scott," you are indeed likely to be 'the grand Napoleon of the realms of print .'"- "If you outlive me," says Constable with a regal smile, "I bespeak that line for my tomb-stone, but, in the meantime, may I presume to ask you to be my right-hand man when I open my campaign of Marengo? I have now settled my outline of operations — a three-shilling or half-crown volume every month, which must and shall sell, not by thousands or tens of thousands, but by hundreds of thousands- ay, by millions! Twelve volumes in the year, a halfpenny of profit upon every copy of which will make me richer than the possession to all the quartos that ever were, or will be, hot-pressed! — twelve volumes so good that millions must wish to have them and so cheap that every butcher's callant may have them, if he pleases to let me tax him sixpence a week! Scott readily consented to take part in the enterprise and expressed the opinion that historical writing had not been adapted to the needs of the "increased circles" which Constable had in mind. He concluded with this question: "What say you to taking the field with a Life of the other Napoleon?" Before Constable left Abbotsford it was agreed that the series should begin with alternate installments of Waverley and a Life of Napoleon Bonaparte by the author of Waverley and that Scott was to write other historical works until all his novels had been incorporated into the Miscellany on this dual plan. This, then, was Constable's outline of a project which, in Lockhart's opinion, was "to lead the way in one of the greatest revolutions that literary history will ever have to record — a revolution not the less sure to be completed, though as yet, after the lapse of twelve years, we see only its beginnings." Constable's hope was thwarted by the financial crash of 1826, his loss of Scott's novels, and the failure of his health. Nevertheless he announced Constable's Miscellany of Original and Selected Publications in the various departments of Literature, Science, and the Arts designed to provide cheap, various, useful, and agreeable knowledge. It was to include not only reprints of works already "stamped with public approbation" but original treatises calculated to fill "acknowledged chasms in the existing stock of useful learning." Thanks to the offices of Sir Walter Scott the Miscellany was dedicated to the King.

At the outset the price was 3/6 but because of the success of the Cabinet Cyclopedia, a competing series, a better made edition was added in 1832 at the price of 5/. Constable was immediately followed by imitators and competitors. The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge began to publish its treatises in March, 1827, and in April, 1829 John Murray began his Family Library, probably the most notable of the series, under the able editorship of Lockhart. 2 The first number of the latter was a telling success because it combined two great names and a great talent: it was Scott's Life of Napoleon Bonaparte written and revised by Lockhart himself. For good measure it was illustrated by Cruikshank. Within the year Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopedia, edited by the eminent Dr. Dionysius Lardner for Longman's began publication with a History of Scotland by none other than Sir Walter Scott. The longest lived of the series it continued for twenty years and finally included 132 volumes. In addition to other regular series such as Valpy's Family Classical Library, the Edinburgh Cabinet Library, and Lardner's Cabinet Library, there were numerous sporadical serial publications bearing such titles as Library for the People, Autobiography, and the Little Library. Dibdin, in his description of the depression of the book trade in 1831, says that it was only the "army of Lilliputians, headed by Dr. Lardner-"that made any progress. 3 "Cheap knowledge" became a catchword of the day so that the Times (April 9, 1833) could begin its review of The Giant Horse, or Siege of Troy , playing in Astley's Amphitheatre, as follows: "To go into any detail of the events on which the story is founded is in the present age of cheap knowledge we hope unnecessary. . . ." A glance at the titles in the several series suggests that the publishers were or became uncertain as to the needs and interests of the readers whom they hoped to attract. Although Constable originally intended to concentrate upon fiction and history, when the time came to announce his Miscellany he promised some attention to "useful learning." The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge boasted that its list would be unified by a common purpose — useful instruction, but in point of fact the Society misjudged its audience. The treatises were so abstruse, technical, and utilitarian that, despite the low price of sixpence a part, the Society was obliged to add a new series, a Library of Entertaining Knowledge, priced at two shillings. Although Dr. Lardner had achieved fame as an author of scientific works — and notoriety for his part in a triangular love-affair which led to a trial and to his exile — he restricted natural history and natural philosophy to less than one-fourth of the titles in the Cabinet Cyclopedia and devoted one-half of them to history. The publishers, it would appear, were not sure of the purpose of these series. Were they to train the young man or to comfort the old man? Were they to encourage the poor ambitious man or to accommodate the busy man? Were they to be read by all ages and both sexes? It was, therefore, audacious but perfectly logical of Colburn and Bentley to enter the race for new readers by driving up four abreast. The Athenaeum (July 24, 1830), vexed by what it regarded as unduly broad claims and pretensions on the part of publishers, summarized the situation as follows: "Great must be the rewards of learning, for many are the hands which are feeding and stuffing that great lubberly brat, the Public." The Athenaeum then characterised the leading series: Constable's Miscellany and Murray's Family Library supplied books on court, camp, and gallery; Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopedia ran to history and science; the Library of Useful Knowledge specialized in puddings and mousetraps; the Library of Entertaining Knowledge in ball and quoits; Valpy wooed with classical heathens "and finally, Colburn comes to the attack in four divisions, with his Library of General Knowledge — his Novelist's Library — his Library of Voyages and Travels — and his Library of Juvenile Knowledge." The Colburn and Bentley project undoubtedly was pretentious, and it was beyond the powers of the firm to fulfill it; yet the plan recognized the diversity in the so-called reading public. But Colburn and Bentley were late in making their entry. It was not until 1830 that Bentley began negotiating with G.R.Gleig, the Scotch divine and novelist, with respect to the editorship of a series to be called the National Library. His reasons for approaching Gleig are not clear although it may be noted that the editors of the already established series were Caledonians and that Gleig was or became a mainstay of Blackwood's Magazine in all departments. But Bentley's choice was not a happy one, for Gleig lacked wide acquaintance with writers, tactfulness in approaching prospective authors, and patience in handling manuscripts. He also lacked steadiness of temperament and was subject to undue optimism and despair. At the outset Gleig was overconfident. He was sure that the series would succeed simply by following in the steps of Longman and Murray. In his first letter (February 5, 1830) Gleig reminded Bentley that Dr. Lardner and Lockhart were getting £600 a year and a one-third share in the profits of the Cabinet Cyclopedia and the Family Library. Gleig will serve for a time for a share and £300 yearly but only on the understanding that the stipend is to increase to £600 on the "absolute success of the series." He also assumed that Bentley would follow Longman and Murray in another respect — namely, give adequate prices to all authors and large prices to men of "high name." Gleig closed the let ter with a veiled threat: if Bentley chose an editor who did not meet with Gleig's approval, he would not be associated with the series. He granted that Thomas Campbell, who must have been mentioned by Bentley as a possible editor, was both able and respectable "but not being of my own class I cannot serve under him." These terms proving acceptable to Bentley, Gleig laid down further ones in his next letter (February 10, 1830). He wanted "a good deal" of his own way in planning the work and selecting the subjects, and he begged Bentley "not to puff too much," for puffing would be distasteful to Scott, Southey, and others of their rank. Gleig then pointed out the likely advantages of the series to Bentley; it will extricate him from "various connections" and it will draw to him a better class of authors. Gleig was of course assuming that he could enlist the support of the very men who were already engaged by Bentley's competitors. Within a month Gleig learned that it was not easy to capture the contributors he had in mind. His confidence somewhat shaken, he wrote to Bentley (March 7, 1830) that Scott and Southey had already pledged themselves elsewhere and that "almost all the great names are engaged. We were too late of coming to our determination." He had not, however, given up hope, and during the next two months he and Bentley went forward with their plans. It appears that Bentley made most of the suggestions. He drew up a list of titles which included a History of Architecture, a History of the Moors, Specimens of the Wits, a Life of Sheridan, and the Rise and Progress of Medicine. And it was he who secured the services of Gifford and Maginn. The National Library was launched August 25, 1830, with Galt's Life of Byron , and it was ill-fated from the outset. The choice of the initial volume was Bentley's. Gleig was uncertain about the wisdom of it and suggested delay. As late as July 7 he was anxious about Galt's "bad taste" and "questionable philosophy", and he had revised the text so much that he recommended that the copy should not be shown to Galt. In his next letter (July 26) Gleig was decidedly apprehensive: proofs had not been sent to him, and he asked for assurance that printing would not proceed until every sheet had been revised by him. He urged, "Let us send out our first free of bad taste or dubious morals." It was then proposed that the book be issued with an avowal that it contained opinions disapproved by the editor of the National Library, but Gleig flatly rejected the suggestion. He declared that this would be a ruinous way to begin the series and that it would not protect him from censure. Gleig closed with this ultimatum: The Life of Byron must be published with the editor's revisions, or he would withdraw from the National Library and make a public announcement of his action. 4 Bentley apparently was determined to publish Galt's book, probably because the appearance of Moore's Life of Byron had created a fresh interest in the subject. Galt's Life was savagely attacked by the Athenaeum (September 4, 1830) which seized upon the book in its campaign against puffing. The reviewer had been provoked by the advance assurance of the greatness of Galt's forthcoming book and by the "customary sweet, reluctant, amorous delays" in the publication of it. Actually, said the reviewer, there was nothing in Galt's Life of Byron that had not already been said by Dallas, Moore, and Hunt. Galt's prose style was mercilessly ridiculed, his sentences being compared to the cage on Waterloo Bridge which contained a "cat, bird, mouse, rat, dog, and monkey — all living together". The Athenaeum concluded its notice with the prophetic opinion that the National Library would be a failure. The second book in the National Library, Gleig's History of the Bible was positively disastrous. Whereas Galt's book had been criticized for the way in which it was advertised, Gleig's was attacked as a book. The Athenaeum (October 16, 1830) spent four solid pages in exposing Gleig's inaccuracy, irresponsible speculation, and muddled organization. The reviewer found the book so faulty that at the end of the long article he had treated only ninety-three pages. He resumed the attack two weeks later only to give up in exhaustion and vexation. The Athenaeum notice (February 26, 1831) of the second volume of Gleig's History of the Bible was equally harsh and concluded: "The National Library was an abortive, rickety starveling from the first, and it is not to be regretted that this second dose of the Romance of Sacred History, will in all probability put an end to its miserable existence." Most of the other books in the series met with a similar reception. G.P.R.James's History of Chivalry was denounced by the Athenaeum (December 25, 1830) as a shabby work made to order by a "name" who did not know history. Horace Smith's reputation for cleverness did not blind reviewers to the fact that his Festivals, Games and Amusements, Ancient and Modern was a poorly organized compound of personal opinions and facts lifted from the Encyclopedia Britannica . Thomson's History of Chemistry and St. John's Lives of Celebrated Travellers were conceded to be workmanlike jobs; the latter, according to the Athenaeum (July 23, 1831), deserved to become "extensively popular." But this favorable turn came too late. The series was doomed, and with the publication of one additional book, Medwin's Conversations of Byron , the National Library came to a stop February 29, 1831, hardly more than a year after it had begun. The decision to discontinue the series was made by Colburn who acted suddenly and without consulting his partner. Not only at the time but for years afterward Bentley resented the high-handed manner in which Colburn had laid down his verdict, and he strongly felt that the decision was unwise. But in view of the record of the sales of the National Library it is difficult to see how it could have been continued and how Bentley could have held out any hope for it. The summary shows a steady decrease in the numbers of copies printed and an increase in the number of copies which remained unsold. Galt's Life of Byron was printed in an edition of 8500 of which all but 164 were sold. Gleig's History of the Bible was reduced to 6000 but 1791 copies remained. The first volume of the History of Chemistry was also printed in an edition of 6000 of which 4054 did not sell. The printings of the Horace Smith and G.P.R.James books were cut to 4000 and 5000 respectively but only 2000 of each were sold. In sum, 55,750 copies of 13 volumes of the National Library were printed, and the column of remainders adds up to 21, 829 and carries the melancholy annotation "sold to Tegg 1/6 per vol." There were several reasons for the failure of the National Library, one of them being the deficiencies of Gleig as editor. He simply lacked the experience and judgment of a Lockhart. The latter had a wide acquaintance among writers, and, belying his by-name the Scorpion, he was tactful and sympathetic in his relations with them. 5 Lockhart held guiding principles with respect to the nature and function of a cheap series. Thus the inclusion of numerous Lives, ranging from Alexander the Great to British Physicians, in the Family Library was the result of Lockhart's conviction that the most effective way of teaching history to the class of readers he sought was "throwing the materials of history into the ever attractive form of biography." 6 Lockhart also had a working principle with respect to abridgements; he felt that they should "have as much as possible of the original manner of the old writers." 7 It was, then, no accident that Captain Head, in preparing the Life of Bruce for the Family Library, carefully kept the best of the explorer's descriptive passages. Gleig's editorial policy seems to have been a negative one based upon caution alone. He sought the apparent but deceptive safety of broad treatments of large subjects. He opposed Bentley's wish to include a book on the French Revolution, and he instead commissioned a general survey of French History. 8 He lacked the courage and originality to accept or plan such books as Chambers' History of the '45 and Palgrave's History of England (Anglo-Saxon) which appeared in Constable's Miscellany and the Family Library. Gleig's excessive caution was a special handicap because the National Library was late in entering the competition for readers. The writers of reputation were already engaged and the obvious subjects were taken by other series. Gleig's negotiation with Carlyle will illustrate both his hesitancy to entrust an assignment to a nameless writer and the danger of duplicating a book in a competing series. Gleig decided against Carlyle for two reasons: his price of £300 was decidedly too high for a man without a reputation, and a book on the subject he proposed — the history of the Reformation — was already in progress for another publisher. Some outright duplication was inevitable, but unfortunately for Bentley the National Library proved to be the inferior. For example, James's History of Chivalry fell far short of Henry Stebbings' book on the same subject in Constable's Miscellany, and Gleig's work on the Bible was as nothing compared with Milman's History of the Jews in the Family Library. The history of the Juvenile Library was even more dismal than that of the National. It began bravely enough on April 30, 1830, when Colburn and Bentley signed an agreement with William Jerdan as editor of the series. The first clause contained the usual preliminary matter: Jerdan was to edit, revise, and prepare; he was to obtain the best writers on the most reasonable terms. The financial arrangements were sufficiently optimistic: Jerdan's annual stipend was to be £300 so long as one number was published each month, but if additional titles were issued Jerdan was to have a further £25 for each. In the event that every title reached a monthly sale of 5000 and continued to sell that number, Jerdan was to receive a bonus of £50. And in a final burst of optimism Colburn and Bentley promised a further bonus of £50 for every increase of 1000 copies in the monthly sale of all titles. The agreement concludes with a sobering clause to the effect that the Juvenile Library was to be continued only so long as it was advantageous to Colburn and Bentley. 9 Thanks to his experience as editor of the Literary Gazette and as founder of the Royal Society of Literature Jerdan was able to assemble an imposing if heterogeneous list of subjects and writers which, in a statement drawn up at the time the Juvenile was abandoned, reads as follows: Children of Israel Dr. Wait done, paid for by W.J. besides a further advance Contrasts Miss Jewsbury in progress Ireland C. Croker in progress nearly complete Scotland Chambers " " " " Turkey W.H. Smith " " " " Reformation Tytler hardly begun Lives of the Poets L.E.L. half vol. done Greeks Rev.

Thomson small progress if any Circumnavigators Captain Beecher " " " " Chemistry Atkins Ms in hand Dress Planche considerable progress Roman Emperors Capt. Williams progress but not very far he being ill On the face of it Jerdan's selection of authors was safe, for he took the easy course of engaging writers who had contributed to other serial works. Thus P.F. Tytler, highly regarded by Sir Walter Scott, had written for both the Family Library and the Edinburgh Cabinet Library. Robert Chambers had contributed two volumes on the history of Scotland to Constable's Miscellany, and de Trueba had written two on Spanish subjects for the same series. Crofton Croker was the natural choice for a book on Ireland since his book on the legends of his native land had been included in the Family Library and had been translated by the brothers Grimm. But only three numbers of the Juvenile Library were ever published: Lives of Remarkable Youths of Both Sexes by D.S. Williams and Don Telesforo de trueba y Cosio (June 28, 1830); Historic Anecdotes of France by Samuel Carter Hall (July 28, 1830); and Africa: Its History by Miss Webb (October 4, 1830). It would seem that the only purpose of the series was to provide matter for some bright paragraphs in the Athenaeum (July 17, 1830). That journal reported a rumor to the effect that Colburn and Bentley had wanted to use the title Juvenile Family Library but that in consequence of Jerdan's refusal to sanction such filching from Murray "the Burlington Street work was therefore not permitted to continue in the Family way before it was delivered." The Athenaeum found the first two numbers to be "hasty, pretending, ill-written, dull" abridgements, and it declared; "we do not know how the young of both sexes could be better employed, for the improvement of their minds, than in correcting sentences in the first volume of the Juvenile Library." 10 As a result of this harsh but deserved attack Jerdan delayed the publication of the third volume for two months in order to revise the manuscript. The Athenaeum (October 23, 1830) recognized the improvement with the begrudging admission that Africa was "in a less pretending style than that of its melancholy predecessors, and may be endured by those who are curious to see Africa in a nutshell. . . . The Gentleman, who advertised to jump into a quart bottle, for his own benefit , has found a dangerous rival in this gentle historian." The Athenaeum concluded by alluding to rumored hostilities between Jerdan and his publishers and suggested "that it is not very improbable but that this juvenile expedition to the Timbuctoo of knowledge may utterly perish in Africa!" The Athenaeum was right on all counts. The Juvenile Library was a flat failure, and one of the reasons was the haste with which the books were produced. How hastily was vividly recalled by Samuel Carter Hall who related how Jerdan, in a state of harassed apprehension, came to him on the ninth day of a month and explained that a History of France promised for the first day of the next month was not forthcoming. Jerdan declared that it was a case of producing the book or closing the series, and he asked Hall to undertake the task. Agreeing to do so, Hall spent one day surrounding himself with a hundred books on France. He then had a eighteen days in which to produce a book of four hundred pages. During one stretch of twelve days he never went to bed, and the result was a brain-fever and a wretched book. Hall naively concluded:" It is somewhat strange that Jerdan in his Autobiography has made no mention of this series or of his engagement with Colburn and Bentley as its editor." 11 The Athenaeum's suspicion that bad feelings had developed between Jerdan and his publishers is borne out by the summary of the Juvenile Library quoted above. It is in Ollier's hand and carries a discreet annotation to the effect that it was dictated by Jerdan who carried away a duplicate copy. In other words, a quarrel had broken out between editor and publisher. They were no longer on speaking terms, and Jerdan had described his defeat to Ollier, general handy man in New Burlington Street. There was, of course, another possible reason for the failure of the Juvenile. Perhaps Gleig was right in warning Bentley, in a letter of July 2, 1830, of the danger of running "two coaches in opposition from the same house." In theory the two series were designed for different readers, but in fact they may have duplicated each other. The next to the last word on the Juvenile Library is supplied by a slip of paper which reads as follows: Juvenile Jerdan editing £125 sale no. 1 3300 copyrights 400 " " 2 2000 advertising 500 " " 3 1300 ---- illustration 250 6600 £875 binding 180 stock 3600 £160 --- printing 180 £1035 paper 300 Loss £900 The last word on the subject is to be found in some papers relating to the final settlement between the partners. For years Colburn repeatedly insisted that Bentley should be charged with three of the never published Juveniles: Mrs. Lee's Africa £50; Mr. Lander's Grecian Biography £75; Dr. Wait's History of the Jews £75. In an undated memorandum Bentley stoutly asserted that he would not allow this claim. Clearly he did not wish to hear about the Juvenile Library, let alone pay £200 on it. 12 It should be remarked, however, that if the National and Juvenile libraries were hopeless failures, the series of some other publishers were something less than successful. The march of intellect was noisy and showy, but the numerous series did not exactly prosper. The best of them, John Murray's Family Library, lasted for only five years. In 1834 the entire stock of 100,000 copies was remaindered to Tegg at one shilling each. The fact that Tegg disposed of them all at 3/6 should not be construed to mean that the problem was simply a matter of Murray's price, six shillings, having been too high. If price had been the decisive factor, Charles Knight's Book Club For All Readers should have been a complete success for he gave three hundred pages for one shilling. Yet of the 186 volumes that he published not twenty reached a sale of ten thousand and the average was 5,000. 13 The real reason for Knight's disappointment was the fact that he included only six works of fiction. The lack of novels and romances was probably one cause of the very moderate success of the series in general. As early as 1816 on the first page of The Statesman's Manual Coleridge asserted that the "reading public"—which, he wryly said, was "as strange a phrase, methinks, as ever forced a splenetic smile on the staid countenance of meditation" — "dieted at the two public ordinaries of literature, the circulating libraries and the periodical press." Coleridge's opinion is borne out by the records of what people were actually reading. The preference for fiction comes out in the analysis of the books in the libraries established by the working men of Nottingham: history 65 volumes; biography 80; voyages, travel, and topography 57; poetry, plays, and essays 57; natural philosophy and science 38; novels, romances, and tales 647. 14 The demand for fiction is even more strongly shown in the figures on the holdings of ten circulating libraries patronized by the lower classes in Westminster. 15 Number Percentage Novels by Walter Scott and novels in imitation of him; Galt, etc. 166 7.57 Novels by Hook, Bulwer, etc. 41 1.87 Novels by Marryat, Cooper, Washington Irving 115 5.24 Voyages, travels, history, biography 136 6.21 Novels by Miss Edgeworth, moral and religious novels 49 2.27 Novels of good character, Dr. Johnson, Goldsmith, etc. 27 1.23 Romances, Castle of Otranto, etc. 76 3.46 Fashionable novels, well-known 439 20. Novels of lowest character, being chiefly imitations of fashionable novels, containing no good although probably nothing decidedly bad 1008 46. Miscellaneous old books, Newgate Calendar, etc. 86 3.92 Lord Byron's works, Smollet's, Fielding's, Gil Blas etc. 39 1.78 Books decidedly bad 10 .45 In sum, upwards of eighty-five per cent of the books in these libraries were fiction, and it would appear that Constable, in his original scheme for his Miscellany, was right in planning to issue the books in pairs— that is, every alternate number was to be a novel. But his plan was frustrated, and no other publisher took advantage of the public demand for fiction until Colburn and Bentley launched their Standard Novels. In view of the foregoing statistics it is not surprising that the story of the Standard Novels was quite different from that of the two preceding series. Not only was there a demand for fiction, but, since the Standard Novels were reprints, the risk of judging manuscripts was evaded and the venture was essentially one of marketing. The launching of this series, then, was not quite so brave and reckless as Sir Michael Sadleir suggests. 16 But it was important in the history of the firm, for the losses incurred by the other series had strained the financial resources of the partnership. The Standard Novels was a success from the outset. Begun with Cooper's The Pilot on February 25, 1831, it flourished for over twenty years and finally included 126 volumes. The last one, interestingly enough, was also a Cooper novel, Wyandotte (December, 1854). The Standard Novels was first thought of by one John Burke with whom Colburn and Bentley signed an agreement (April 5, 1830) by which Burke was to receive £100 as a premium and £50 yearly for the life of the series in return for the idea of the work and for his assistance in superintending the printing, suggesting subjects for embellishments, and forwarding the engravings. A few months later (September 17, 1830) Burke relinquished all interest in the series in consideration of a cash payment of £150. 17 The original idea, then, came from Burke though the successful execution of it was Bentley's. But it is unlikely that the idea was wholly original with Burke, for the emphasis upon embellishments and engraving in the agreement cited above strongly suggests that he had in mind Cadell's Waverley Novels , begun June 1, 1829. Steel engraved frontispieces were a feature of this very successful series. Add to it the other marks of Cadell's Waverley — cloth binding, regular monthly issue, the low price of five shillings— and the result is the idea which John Burke sold to Colburn and Bentley for £250. In short, Sir Walter Scott, whose influence is everywhere in the history of the nineteenth century fiction, was responsible not only for the three-volume novel priced at 31/6 but for the inexpensive one-volume reprint as well. When Colburn and Bentley came to announce the Standard Novels, they freely acknowledged — or rather proclaimed — the similarity of their series to Cadell's edition of Scott. It was good business to do so. Their first advertisement read: "Standard Novels— A Companion to the Waverley Novels." And shortly afterwards Colburn and Bentley announced that in order to make the Standard Novels "still more worthy of companionship with the Waverley Novels" and in order to include novels of "nearly every age" they had purchased the copyright of Ballantyne's Novelists' Library with the "copious Biographical and Critical Memoirs" of Sir Walter Scott prefixed to each. But they were soon informed by Scott's executors that Tegg, whom they had paid £105, had no right to sell the copyright of Scott. 18 So strong was Scott's influence that when Bentley discovered that he could not use the Memoirs he decided against reprinting any of the eighteenth-century novels in the Ballantyne collection. Thus he was deflected from his original intention of making the Standard novels a repository of classic novels and romances, and he was compelled to concentrate upon recent fiction. As Sir Michael Sadleir has pointed out, this emphasis, as it turned out, became one of the distinctive attractions of the series. Another special feature of the Standard Novels accidentally arose from the fact that Bentley launched the series with an American work. Indeed, three of the first numbers were novels by Cooper. Now in order to secure an English copyright to these Bentley had to get from Cooper alterations in the text or additional matter in the way of prefaces and notes. And having been compelled to do this for one writer, he made it a working principle for many others especially during the first ten years of the series. Thus sixty of the titles, according to Sir Michael Sadleir's reckoning, are something more than plain reprints, and they have a special value to students of literary texts. "This was intelligent publishing," Sir Michael writes, "and it so worked out as to justify the Standard Novel Series in the important claim that many of the texts therein included were the texts finally approved by their authors , or at least provided with prefaces in which the author's mature judgment was passed on early work of his or her own." 19 It may be, however, that a scrutiny of the texts would result in some modification of this claim. The files reveal evidence to suggest that some of the revision was very superficial through no fault of Bentley himself. For example, when the publisher invited Horatio Smith to revise his Involuntary Prophet for the Standard Novels, Smith replied than he had carefully read the tale but found "nothing to correct — except two trifling errors in the Press." 20 And in some instances Bentley's claims for the "additional matter" were much too pretentious. Corinne , newly translated for the series, was prefaced by a fifty-page memoir of Madame de Staël supposedly written by the unnamed editor of the Standard Novels who acknowledged his indebtedness to Mrs. Child's Life of Madame de Staël , Madame Junot's Memoirs , and Lord Byron's notes to the fourth canto of Childe Harold . The Athenaeum (February 2, 1833), which from the outset was very favorable to the Standard Novels, promptly exposed the preface as being a word-for-word reprint of Mrs. Child's American book except for some "absurd omissions, curtailings, and dovetailings." The editorial acknowledgement, the Athenaeum declared, was a mere blind: there was only one quotation from Madame Junot and one from Byron. Granting this reservation, it is still true that the Standard Novels, together with its successors the Favorite and the Popular Novels, raises many interesting textual problems. For example, Susan Ferrier's Marriage , written 1810, was much altered in 1841 for the Standard Novels. Other publishers issued mutilated amended versions in 1856 and 1878, and finally in 1881-82 Bentley published a definitive text of it and the other Ferrier novels. Another textual problem may be seen in the three versions of Whitehead's Richard Savage — the serialization in Bentley's Miscellany , the three-decker forms, and the single-volume edition in the Standard Library. Reprinting in the series not only invited compression of a text but it permitted alteration of a tragic ending to a happy one and even complete rewriting of a novel. Trollope, it is interesting to note, did not wish to avail himself of these opportunities. He had removed sixty pages from The Three Clerks for the five shilling edition but when Bentley invited him to reduce it by a further one hundred pages for the Standard Novels (1860) Trollope declined on the ground that it was too much trouble. He admitted, however, that there was an episode of some forty pages that could be removed. 21 Although these problems have not been closely examined, it is obvious that the rewriting and revision of novels did not begin with George Moore and Henry James. To summarize Sir Michael Sadleir's description of the attractions of the Standard Novels: it offered a contemporary or recent novel, often in a specially prepared text, complete in one volume in an attractive format for six shillings. Since in Cadell's edition of Scott a novel ran to two volumes, Bentley could rightly assert that no publisher of fiction had ever tendered such value. The Press was quick to applaud. From the first the Athenaeum took the Standard Novels under its "special patronage", and it later (April 7, 1832) announced that "every successive volume of this work is a fresh claim on the public." With the publication of the complete novels of Jane Austen in five "neat and elegant volumes", the Standard Novels, said the Athenaeum , had fulfilled its promise. The following authors, with the number of their novels, will indicate the scope of the series: Jane Austen (6), Bulwer (3), Cooper (21), Edgeworth (1), Ferrier (3), Godwin (3), Gore (4), Hook (6), G.P.R. James (5), Manzoni (1), Marryat (11), Maxwell (4), Peacock (4), and Mrs. Trollope (2). The prosperity of the series in the early years is indicated by the fact that twenty-two titles were issued during the first two years and also by the fact that the original price of six shillings was maintained through 1846. By 1845 the number had dropped to four and in November, 1847, the price was reduced to five shillings and two years later to 3/6. The success of the Standard Novels comes out in the statistics compiled for the dissolution of the partnership of Colburn and Bentley August 31, 1832, as found in the appended chart. It may be pointed out that the average payment for copyright was something over £40 and that the breakeven point was about 3300 copies. The three Cooper novels brought in a profit of £656, more than the total (£504) of the nine other novels. From the very outset Bentley planned to include in the series novels which had originally appeared under the imprint of other publishers. He paid the family of Jane Austen £250 for the rights to the five novels which they controlled. 22 But when (September 7, 1831) he offered Baldwin and Craddock £400 for the reprint rights of four of Miss Edgeworth's books nothing came of the proposal. He vainly offered Blackwood £175 for the right to include The Provost, The Ayrshire Legatees, The Entail, Annals of the Parish, Sir Andrew Wylie, Cyril Thornton, Pen Owen, Tom Cringle's Log, Percy Mallory , and The Cruise of the Midge . 23 This last offer was undoubtedly too thrifty, but Bentley may have been remembering an earlier transaction on which the loss had been heavy. This occurred in 1831 when the partners paid Longman's £700 for the novels and romances of Jane and Maria Porter, and after six had been issued in the Standard Novels the deficit amounted to £230. The information is too fragmentary to enable one to say exactly how far Bentley's own authors profited from the Standard Novels. John Banim received £50 for a reprint edition. The agreement for Helen , the only one of Maria Edgeworth's novels to come from New Burlington Street, was as follows: £800 for the first edition; £200 additional upon a sale of 2900 copies; and a further £100 for inclusion in the Standard Library. 24 Marryat demanded £150 for the reprinting of Kings' Own and Newton Forster in Standard Novels for a period of only three years. But since J.G. Lockhart, who acted as agent for Maria Edgeworth, clearly thought that the terms for Helen were generous and since Marryat was an exceptionally shrewd bargainer, it may well be that these last examples are not representative. However that may be, payment for inclusion in the Standard Novels, together with the reputation of the series, must have been one of the attractions of the House of Bentley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Jeffrey, in his review of Crabbe's Tales in the Edinburgh Review (November, 1812) made the same point: "In this country, there probably are not less than 300,000 persons who read for amusement or instruction, among the middling classes of society. In the higher classes, there are not as many as 30,000." 2 As early as 1825 Murray had projected a cheap, popular series of voyages and travels. See Samuel Smiles, A Publisher and His Friends (1891), II, 295. 3 Bibliophobia (1832), p. 18. 4 It is not clear whether Gleig's alterations were incorporated into the text. 5 See for example Alan Cunningham's tribute to Lockhart in the preface to the last volume of his Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects . 6 From a letter (May 16, 1825) to Constable who was picking Lockhart's brains to the benefit of the Miscellany . See T. Constable, Archibald Constable and His Literary Correspondents (1873), III, 315. 7 Ibid. , p. 316. 8 Such brief treatments of large subjects were ridiculed in the Athenaeum (January 22, 1831) as "railroads across the wide common of universal knowledge." In this connection it is interesting to recall the following passage from Wordsworth's letter of January 12, 1838 to Dr. Lardner: "The subject which I had thought of is much more limited than you suppose— being nothing more than an Account of the Deceased Poetesses of Great Britain — with an Estimate of their Works — but upon more mature Reflection I cannot persuade myself that it is sufficiently interesting for a separate subject, were I able to do it justice. The Dramatic and other imaginative female Writers might be added — the interest would thereby be encreased, but unity of subject would be sacrificed." 9 The agreement is in the British Museum, Add.MSS 46,611. There is no indication as to which one of the partners was instrumental in the selection of Jerdan. Although Jerdan and Colburn were associated as early as 1817, political and literary differences developed which caused Colburn to help establish the Athenaeum (1827) as a rival to Jerdan's Literary Gazette . Colburn was, however, quite willing to make use of enemies. 10 Samuel Carter Hall has it that Jerdan wrote this book. See his Retrospect of a Long Life (1883), p. 179. Jerdan in his spacious autobiography, has not a word on the Juvenile Library. 11 Ibid . 12 Three books were later salvaged from the Juvenile Library: Chambers' Scotland ; Tytler's Reigns of Edward VI and Mary ; James's Lives of Celebrated Commanders .

      <field name="fulltext">Dr Curt Bühler's account of the imposition of an edition of Valerius Maximus dated Amsterdam, 1671 and probably printed by Johann Blaeu should have a much wider usefulness than he claims for it. 1 24mos in threes 'the sixteen way' must be fairly common if one may judge from their inclusion in text-books, but no doubt they have often been recorded as 16mos, a mistake easily made since the chainlines in both formats are horizontal unless the printer used half sheets of double paper or paper made two sheets at a time on broad double moulds. The incidence of the watermarks should give warning of the ternary imposition. Dr Bühler's example is of the standard two squares and an oblong type, with the square sections imposed as octavos, but all three sections could be oblong. It is to be found in Georg Wolffger's New-Auffgesetztes Format-Büchlein , Graz, 1672, 2 and I represent it in diagram 1. (All my diagrams, following Dr Bühler's convenient precedent, show the positions of the pages in the sheet and not, as the text-books show them, in the forme.) Diagram 2, from M. D. Fertel, La science pratique de l'imprimerie , Saint Omer, 1723, pp. 166-167, is the same as 1 except that the inner forme of B is imposed with the outer forme of A. In diagram 3, from J. G. Ernesti, Die wol-eingerichtete Buchdruckerey , 2nd ed., Nürnberg, 1733, pp. 96-97, section B is turned round so that leaves 1 and 3 change places. Here too the inner forme of B could be imposed with the outer forme of A, making a second pair of variants like the Wolffger-Fertel one, and in that case B1 v would occupy the position of B2 v in the diagram. Thus A1 at the corner of the sheet may be accompanied by B1 at top left (Wolffger), top right (Fertel), bottom right (Ernesti) or bottom left (postulated). Section C is the same in Wolffger, Fertel and Ernesti, but it could theoretically, and rather improbably, undergo the four mutations of B in relation to A, and any of its four states could be combined with any of the A-B combinations. Fertel, it may be noted, instructs the binder to fold section C twice from end to end and once down the middle — Dr Bühler is mistaken in supposing that it has to be cut. Diagram 4 represents another imposition of section C diagnosed by Mr I. J. C. Foster and myself in Jacobus Hautinus, Angelus custos , Antverpiæ, J. Cnobbaert, 1636, from the copy in the University Library, Durham. Sections A and B are as in Wolffger, proved by the occurrence of watermarks across the fold near the head of 2-7 in most A sections and of 1-8 in some B sections. In this and in the partly uncut and unopened copy in the Bodleian Library, all the C sections have been folded as required for the Wolffger-Fertel-Ernesti imposition, so that the order of the leaves is 1,4,3,2, 7,6,5,8, suggesting that that imposition was the one most familiar to the binder. With Cnobbaert's imposition it is necessary to begin by folding ends to middle.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Watermarks and the Dates of Fifteenth-Century Books by Curt F. Bühler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nearly half a century ago, a landmark now famous in the annals of historical research made its memorable appearance; this was Charles M. Briquet's Les Filigranes (Paris, 1907), a work to which many students in varied fields of scholarship still turn daily with gratitude. The value of Briquet's contribution in its broadest implications cannot be questioned, whatever reservations one may entertain in regard to the more precise information to be gleaned from its pages. For the students of "prototypographica" in 1907, one of Briquet's summaries seemed to hold the greatest potential significance. 1 This concerned the appearance of "filigranes identiques" in the ordinary fifteenth-century formats of paper; according to Briquet's findings (vol. I, p. xx), the extreme limits of their first and last datable occurrence could be determined in this fashion: Within 1 to 5 years: 512 instances " 6 to 10 " : 255 " " 11 to 15 " : 115 " Thus, 882 of the 978 examples used for this calculation (or 90% of the total) made their initial and final appearance within the limits of fifteen years, the longest recorded extent of duration being 85 years. Briquet's table further indicated that the use of over half the papers was confined to a maximum period of five years. 2 Despite these ascertained facts, the theory that "les filigranes" could supply evidence for the dating of incunables was not heartily endorsed by incunabulists. In respect to this, the comment of the British Museum's great catalogue may be cited: By the aid of M. Briquet's facsimiles it might be possible, according to the method he describes, to use this multiplicity of marks as a means of determining dates. But the method is laborious and not free from uncertainty, so that other kinds of evidence are almost always preferable. 3 In more recent years, especially since the founding of the Paper Publications Society in 1948, the attention of scholars has again been directed towards the significance of watermarks for the determination of date. It has even been suggested that Briquet's estimates were much too liberal and that the normal elapsed time between the manufacture and the final use of a run of paper was three years, frequently less but sometimes as much as ten years. 4 Naturally enough, such assertions have not gone unchallenged, though one need not, perhaps, go so far as to echo the words of a scholarly Keeper of Printed Books at the British Museum, who publicly stated: "I have no use for watermarks." Sir Henry Thomas was, of course, mildly jesting here, though he was serious enough in his reservations as to their use for dating. 5 Nor can one entirely ignore, in this connection, the statement made (in 1923) by the dean of American experts on paper: 6 A great deal has been written on watermarking from a historical point of view but their value as a means of determining the dates of paper, books, and prints or the locality where the paper was made, is to be questioned. The information that watermarks can supply for purposes of dating is beset with several difficulties. First of all, the employment of averages for specific purposes is always hazardous — as observers of scientific facts are well aware. We all recall the story of the man who, in wading through a river, drowned in a channel seven feet deep, having been assured that the average depth was only two feet. Special circumstances may always be present to contradict averages; two such instances are conveniently at hand to illustrate this point. My whole correspondence relating to this article has simply been dated by month and day, and I have suggested to my correspondents that the year can easily be deduced from the watermark in the paper: this happens to provide 1909. In 1956, the Morgan Library issued, as a gift to its Fellows, a facsimile of a previously-unknown Dickens letter; entirely by itself, however, the watermark present in the facsimile would suggest that the edition had been printed forty years ago. The "filigrane" in the Dickens facsimile is — at least so far as I can judge — in the identical state as that found in the printed Archives of the General Convention [of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the U. S. A.], New York, 1911-12. It certainly should be identical since all the paper (Kelmscott Handmade) comes from a single purchase made prior to 1911. The Library has, from time to time, made varied use of this paper — but there is still enough on hand to print a sizable edition of some reasonably-sized text. These facts relate, of course, to special circumstances. Nevertheless, it would manifestly be impossible, five hundred years after the event, to single out the special circumstances from those which were entirely usual. There are, obviously, two prime elements of uncertainty in regard to the use of watermarks for purposes of dating; first, no one is quite certain for how long any particular mould could be used (i.e., how long was it possible to make paper with the same watermark) and, secondly, it is not clear how successful the methods for speedy distribution were — or even if this was considered essential or desirable in those days. Estimates for the "life" of a mould vary between half a year and four years; 7 but how can one ever be sure of the value of such figures in determining the life of any particular mould? It could as well be asked: how long will the machine last upon which the present study is being typed? Clearly, the reader will want to know: (1) who made the type-writer (i.e., question of quality); (2) how is it looked after (problem of maintenance); and (3) how much is it used? This last query is certainly as crucial for a mould for making paper, as Alfred Schulte was quick to recognize, as it is for a type-writer. This scholar 8 preferred to estimate that the average pair of moulds could produce half a million sheets before they became unfit for further use, rather than to speculate on the conjectural life of a mould. 9 We know, too, from contemporary records that early paper-makers were not particularly reliable as a source of supply: 10 plagues, floods, droughts, and other inconveniences played havoc with the productivity of the makers and frequently curtailed the essential water-supply for the mills or made it unfit for use. 11 The dubious facilities for distribution in those days create another factor for uncertainty in the estimates under consideration. As BMC (I:xv) reminds us: 12 "we have to reckon with the existence of middlemen, such as Adolf Rusch, who bought paper from the makers and sold or bartered it to other printers." A most significant time-lag 13 is noted by Adolf Tronnier: Es ist höchst eigentümlich, wenn auch wohl kein Zufall, dass alle die genannten und noch zu nennenden Marken sich ausnahmslos auch in den Strassburger Inkunabeln finden. Auffällig ist dabei, dass sie in Strassburg fast stets ein oder zwei Jahrzehnte früher vorkommen als in Mainz, fast nur in den sechziger und siebziger Jahren. 14 If one accepts this statement, set forth by an eminent and reliable scholar, it is apparent that the same paper might be available for purchase in two cities, joined together by the easiest means of communication known to the Middle Ages (the river Rhine), at intervals of ten and more years. We may now particularize and inquire how palaeographers and art historians view the evidence afforded by watermarks for the purpose of dating. One may cite such views as those of Arthur M. Hind ("the date of manufacture [of paper] is only certain as a terminus a quo ") 15 and Arthur E. Popham 16 ("But in few cases can a water-mark, even when it actually contains a date, afford more than an approximate indication of period post quem "). 17 Palaeographers display similar caution. Regrettably enough, there seems to be no adequate (modern) handbook in English on "Handschriftenkunde", 18 so that we are obliged to fall back upon the recent judgements of two German scholars: Aber auch wenn alle diese Feststellungen lückenlos gemacht sind und das Wasserzeichen einwandfrei erkannt ist, muss noch grosse Vorsicht obwalten, dass daraus nicht zu sichere Schlüsse auf Zeit und Heimat gezogen werden. . . . Alle diese Gründe erklären, warum die grossen Hoffnungen, die man zunächst auf die Wasserzeichenforschung gesetzt, nicht in dem Umfang sich erfüllt haben, wie man sich in der ersten Begeisterung versprochen hatte. 19 Gewiss, als alleiniges Kriterium für die Datierung einer Handschrift reicht das Wasserzeichen nicht aus. 20 The significance of all these remarks will not fail to impress itself upon the reader. Palaeographers and art historians are accustomed to assign material which cannot be identified with an individual, school, or related group of artifacts to quarter-centuries; 21 those scholars who willingly fix such items within specific decades are often considered rash by their colleagues. It is suggested by scholars in these disciplines, then, that watermarks as evidence even for such broad datings must be treated with caution. 22 Among bibliographers, the incunabulists — whether directly or by inference — also suggest that such evidence as "filigranes" afford for establishing dates cannot be employed with precision. Paul Heitz (art historian, palaeographer, and incunabulist) found the same watermarks appearing over wide intervals of time in the incunabula, 23 as well as in documents belonging to the archives, 24 of Strassburg. This fact was further emphasized by Karl Schorbach in his study of the press of Johann Mentelin: In 16 Druckwerken unseres Meisters ist das Ochsenkopfpapier vertreten, und zwar sowohl in seinem ersten [1460] als auch in seinem letzten [1477] Verlagswerk. Erwähnenswert ist noch, dass das bei Mentelin vorliegende Turm-Wasserzeichen [in use 1472-73] auch im Mainzer Catholicon von 1460 vorkommt und später (1480 ff.) oft in Nürnberger Inkunabeln. 25 Similar reservations as to the validity of the evidence of watermarks for dating — whether made directly or implied in practice — can be traced even to experts on the making of paper, its history and use. 26 In connection with this, the above-quoted statement by Dard Hunter may be recalled. We are further reminded that watermarks are "a kind of circumstantial evidence to be used with great caution by bibliographers." 27 Finally, so recently as 1952, the director of the Forschungsstelle Papiergeschichte in the Gutenberg Museum at Mainz, 28 accepted Briquet's judgements in regard to the dating of certain watermarks (nos. 13034-43) "dass einige derselben 50-60 Jahre ohne Veränderung bestanden." Dr. Kazmeier, 29 moreover, cites Briquet without hesitation as the authority for the fact that the Gutenberg Bible's watermark (no. 13040) was used in documents from 1440 to 1495. Solely on the basis of the "filigranes," one wonders, how would this Bible be dated? In the Gutenberg Jahrbuch for the previous year (1951, p. 36), this German scholar expressed the belief that "durch längere Benutzung einzelner Formen, als auch durch Lagerung von Papieren können entsprechende Wasserzeichen um Jahrzehnte verschieden in der Zeit auftreten." This would imply considerable hesitation on the part of a most distinguished "Papier-Forscher" as to the value of the "evidence" which watermarks could furnish for purposes of dating. 30 What value, then, have watermarks for the dating of prototypographica? It seems certain that a "filigrane," without external controls or confirming evidence from other sources, cannot be regarded as a sure guide for the dating, within narrow limits, of mediaeval documents or early printed books. Equally, I am sure, no one will deny that watermarks can, and do , provide essential and valuable pieces of evidence for this purpose; they certainly have a corroborative — though not an absolute — value in arriving at an approximate date for an early printed book. Allan H. Stevenson, for example, has shown that the watermarks in a certain Caxton volume can supply a date for it 31 — and it so happens that this date is one that is made probable by other evidence. 32 But what, one wonders, would the decision have been if the evidence had been contradictory? Relying only upon a watermark with a 1608 date 33 — and with no other evidence to go upon — it would clearly have been impossible to prove that a Shakespeare quarto with the printed date "1600" was actually produced in the year 1619 and at no other time. The watermark would certainly cast suspicion on the year 1600, but it could never have pointed to 1619 as the one likely year of publication. 34 In conclusion, then, it may be stated that watermarks, instead of suggesting a date based on an approximate maximum of three years between manufacture and ultimate use, do furnish the student of fifteenth-century books with an additional (and important) tool for the dating of an incunabulum "sine ulla nota," possibly within a score or so of years as Briquet intimated. It has not been demonstrated, however, that watermarks provide the incunabulist with that absolute criterion which some filigranologists believe to see in them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Compare E. J. Labarre, Dictionary and Encyclopaedia of Paper and Paper-making (Oxford, 1952), p. 358: "His general conclusion was that the probable employment of a given mark fell within a period of about 30 years at most. In the collection of his data Briquet paid attention almost solely to Mss., paper for which, unless they extended to many sheets, was far more likely to have a long currency than that used for books, since small quantities might remain long on hand, while again the varieties of sorts and sizes was great, and the use of paper was not quite so general nor the sorts used so standardized as in later times." This is not quite true since Briquet certainly cited many examples of watermarks from incunabula, as we shall see. Further, the use of paper for the press between 1450 and 1470, must have been insignificant as compared with that used in the production of manuscripts. First of all, the proportion of printing on vellum was then at its highest rate. Secondly, we may recall that prior to 1470 only fourteen presses (established in ten cities) had begun to print, the total production of four of these being quite slight. 2 Conversely, we may note that, according to these findings, over 47% of the examples were in use for a period longer than five years, while 96 watermarks (nearly 10% of the total) continued in use for more than fifteen years. 3 Catalogue of Books Printed in the XVth Century now in the British Museum (London, 1908-1949), I, xv. 4 See, for example, Allan H. Stevenson's estimates in Briquet's Opuscula (Hilversum, 1955), p. xxxix. A more hesitant view was expressed by Edward Heawood, Watermarks mainly of the 17th and 18th Centuries (Hilversum, 1950), p. 31: "The idea that paper-moulds had a fairly long life has been pretty generally held, and the currency of a given mark (in identical form) therefore fairly long — 30 years or so according to Briquet. If correct for early periods it is to be questioned as regards later ones." 5 "Watermarks," Edinburgh Bibliographical Society Transactions , II (1946), 449-450. Sir Henry also observed that watermarks "may be able, during certain later periods, to suggest a date (or at any rate a terminus ante quem non , as in the simple instance [a dated mark] mentioned above) but rarely a place." 6 Dard Hunter, Old Papermaking ([Chillicothe, Ohio], 1923), p. 65. He also states: "The sheets might have been dated in the watermark and then remained in the mill a great time before the paper was sold, and after being purchased the paper might have been held for years in the warehouse of the printer before being printed upon." 7 According to Alfred W. Pollard ( Shakespeare Folios and Quartos [London, 1909], p. 93), Briquet believed that a device "had a life of about two years before it lost its shape altogether." Various estimates are given by Alfred Schulte, "Papiermühlenund Wasserzeichenforschung," Gutenberg Jahrbuch 1934 , p. 22. 8 Schulte, op. cit. , p. 24. The same writer also remarked (in his contribution "G. M. Briquet's Work and the Task of his Successors," The Briquet Album [Hilversum, 1952], p. 56): "If, for instance, it is assumed that a paper-mill manufactured only one size and one sort of paper, it would every year require a new pair of moulds. If, however, it made several sorts and sizes, as was nearly always the case, then this single year of possible usage was extended into several or even many calendar years." 9 Assuming that a certain folio of 200 leaves, in an edition of 200 copies (fairly large for those days), contained equal amounts of three sorts of paper, then the entire edition consumed only 7,000 sheets, or less than 2% of the 500,000 sheets a pair of moulds could produce. An early printer, then, would require in a year's time only a very slight amount of the total production of a mould. 10 Cf. Oscar Hase, Die Koberger (Leipzig, 1885), pp. 71-72. On 17 December 1501, the dealer Friedrich Brechter asked the printer Johann Amerbach to take compassion upon the papermakers ("eyn mytliden haben des bapires halben") with regard to their products (Hase, letter 42, p. XLVIII). 11 Compare the letter from Anton Koberger to Hans Amerbach (31 Dec. 1498) and that from Thomas Anshelm to Hans Koberger (7 Jan. 1518) printed by Hase, pp. XIX and CXXVII. See also Hans H. Bockwitz, Papiermacher und Buchdrucker im Zeitalter Gutenbergs ([Leipzig], 1939), pp. 9-10. 12 On Rusch, compare also Hase, op. cit. , pp. 64-65. 13 In the Koberger correspondence, we find continuous complaints as to the quality of the paper (letters, 7, 8, 49, 50, etc.), much of which was returned by the printer. This contributed an extra delay in the ultimate marketing of some papers. 14 Die Missaldrucke Peter Schöffers und seines Sohnes Johann (Mainz, 1908), p. 81. 15 An Introduction to a History of Woodcut (Boston and New York, 1935), I, 26. On p. 79 he remarks: "Moreover, the uncertain period during which stocks of paper might be kept adds a further limitation in regard to the conjectured dating of woodcuts on the same basis." In his A Short History of Engraving &amp; Etching (London, 1908), p. 17, we find: "the manner in which paper must have been transferred from one country to another, and the uncertainty of interval between manufacture and use, necessitate many reservations and qualifications in accepting this type of evidence." 16 A Handbook to the Drawings and Water-colours in the . . . British Museum (London, 1939), p. 9. 17 Commenting on the use of watermarks for dating, Joseph Meder stated "dass man noch wenig Nutzen aus dem Studium derselben habe ziehen können" ( Die Handzeichnung [Wien, 1923], p. 695). Elsewhere he endorses the view that watermarks are useful in dating "freilich nicht auf das Jahr, so doch auf Dezennien"; Meder also remarks "doch bleiben sie immer nur ein Behelf, der in dem einen Falle rasch zur Entscheidung führt, in dem anderen alle Vorsicht gebietet" ( Dürer-Katalog [Wien, 1932], pp. 8 and 293). Some watermarks occur in Dürer prints throughout his life-time, while the posthumous editions of the Marienleben show the same watermarks in use 1540-65 and 1550-80. 18 On this point, see my review of Sir Hilary Jenkinson's Domesday Re-Bound (London, 1954) in Speculum , XXX (1955), 118-119. 19 Karl Löffler, Einführung in die Handschriftenkunde (Leipzig, 1929), pp. 57-58. Compare also the same writer's remarks in Fritz Milkau, Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft (Leipzig, 1931-40), I, 296: "Dafür bieten die Papierhandschriften durch ihre Wasserzeichen mancherlei Mittel zur zeitlichen und örtlichen Festlegung, freilich nicht in dem Umfang und mit der Sicherheit, wie die Wasserzeichenforschung in der ersten Begeisterung gehofft hatte." 20 Joachim Kirchner, Germanistische Handschriftenpraxis (München, 1950), p. 13. A French view is expressed by Maurice Prou, Manuel de paléographie (Paris, 1910), p. 33: "Ces marques de fabrique considérées comme éléments chronologiques ne sauraient donner qu'un terminus a quo , car il est arrivé que des écrits ont été consignés sur des papiers beaucoup antérieurs à la date de transcription." 21 If objects can be so identified, there will, of course, be external pieces of evidence at hand. It must, however, be recalled that, though printed on paper, the date of production of the blockbooks is still a matter of controversy, these being variously dated between 1420 and 1475. 22 Literary historians express a similar hesitation. "As a rule the utmost that we can do is to determine whether in a particular book or group of books the watermark is the same throughout or not, a point which indeed may be of great importance as indicating whether or not the whole was printed at or about the same time: it is seldom that we can go further and infer anything from the watermark as to the actual date of printing" (Ronald B. McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography [Oxford, 1949], pp. 101-102). Lawrence C. Wroth warns us on the "pit-falls" of dating by means of watermarks in Imago Mundi , XI (1954), 94. See also Rossell H. Robbins, "A Middle English Diatribe against Philip of Burgundy," Neophilologus , 1955, p. 132, n. 3, where he refers to the manuscript as being dated "1436-1456 from the watermarks, but the hand is certainly later ["Second half XV century"]. Watermarks are evidence for establishing a terminus a quo , but not such reliable evidence for a terminus ad quem ." 23 Les filigranes des papiers contenus dans les incunables strasbourgeois de la Bibliothèque Impériale de Strasbourg (Strassburg, 1903). "Le n° 54, représenté ici par le filigrane d'un imprimé de 1477, se retrouve dans des documents beaucoup plus anciens appartenant aux archives de la Ville, et remontant à 1351 et 1399" (p. 9) and p. 10, no. 168: "Ce filigrane a été relevé par Keinz à Munich dans un Codex de 1422. Il se retrouve dans un manuscrit des archives de Strasbourg, remontant à 1438. Nous l'avons copié dans un imprimé sans date de chez Eggesteyn [active 1466-1482]." 24 Les filigranes des papiers contenus dans les archives de la Ville de Strasbourg (Strassburg, 1902). The "Tête de boeuf" mark (Plate V, no. 55) is found in use for 42 years (1413-1455), the "Léopard" (Plate XV, no. 182) for 53 years (1422-1475), and the "Lettre Y" (Plate XIV, no. 154) for 27 years (1455-1482). It will be noted that these years cover the period of the prototypographica. 25 Der Strassburger Frühdrucker Johann Mentelin (Mainz, 1932), pp. 72 and 81. Compare also the table on p. 87. 26 Labarre, op. cit. , p. 358: "If it is true that paper-moulds quickly wore out — as they would especially if used for sorts in common use — the value for dating purposes of the marks they bore would be much enhanced." The use of a conditional clause is certainly significant here. 27 Cf. K. Povey's review of Jean-Marie Janot's Les moulins à papier de la région vosgienne (Nancy, 1952) in The Library , 5th ser., IX (1954), 274. 28 August W. Kazmeier, "Wasserzeichen und Papier der zweiundvierzigzeiligen Bilbel," Gutenberg Jahrbuch 1952 , pp. 21-29. 29 See especially pages 23-26. The Ochsenkopf mark (Briquet 15093) is assigned to Lyons 1400-1409 and to the 42-line Bible. For the Traube mark (Briquet 13008), the given range is Cologne 1427 to Wiesbaden 1458 (and Swiss and French localities of 1437-1466). Dr. Kazmeier seems to find nothing remarkable about these wide spreads of time in the use of these (and other) watermarks. 30 In this connection, see Armin Renker's comment in the new edition of Milkau's Handbuch (Wiesbaden, 1952, I, 1065): "Da fast jedes Stück Papier seinen Ursprungsvermerk in Gestalt eines Zeichens in sich trägt, sollte man annehmen, dass es leicht sein müsste, Zeitpunkt und Ort der Entstehung hieraus zu erkennen. Die Forschung lehrt aber, dass es schwer ist, diese Ursprungsmerkmale zu deuten. . . . Verfügungen über Verleihungen geben zuweilen Anhaltspunkte, weniger das Datum der Dokumente, da ja das Papier bedeutend älter sein kann. Erfahrungsgemäss nimmt man als längsten Spielraum zwischen Anfang der Herstellung und Ende des Verbrauchs eines mittelalterlichen Papiers zehn bis fünfzehn Jahre an; bei grossen und ungewöhnlichen Papieren kann er sich bis zu dreissig Jahren ausdehnen." The recent expressions of even shorter estimates do not seem to have changed Herr Renker's opinion, for these are almost the identical words he printed in his Buch vom Papier (Leipzig, [1934]), p. 107. Compare also Alfred Schulte's opinion cited in note 8. 31 Historie of Jason [Westminster, 1477]. Cf. Briquet's Opuscula (Hilversum, 1955), p. xlii. This year [1477] is also assigned to the Jason by Aurner, Bennett, Blades, Crotch, De Ricci, Duff, Guppy, Hittmair, Plomer, Winship, and the STC (no. 15383). 32 In any event, Caxton's work falls into the last quarter of the fifteenth century. After 1470, the demand for paper by the printing presses must have suddenly become enormous, and the paper-makers hard put to it to supply the demand. In the 1450s and 1460s the requirements of the press would have made no great demands upon the available supply. 33 See Allan H. Stevenson's informative paper "Shakespearian Dated Watermarks," Studies in Bibliography , IV (1951), 159-164. 34 Dard Hunter, op. cit. , p. 66, cites a paper made in 1859 with the date 1810 in the watermark; it was made in Pennsylvania at the Ivy Mills. See also Agnes Mongan and Paul J. Sachs, Drawings in the Fogg Museum of Art (1940), I, 418; here the following comment is made on watermark 45: "The date [as in the reproduction] is given, following a tariff decree of 1741 which ordered that all paper printed after the first of the following January should be dated 1742. The wording of the law was not clear, so that many papermakers continued for years to date their papers '1742'." These examples may serve to alert scholars against "the traps that await the unwary, even in the case of dated watermarks" (Sir Henry Thomas, op. cit. , p. 450).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">New Texts of John Donne by C. F. Main</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Modern editors of Donne's verse have been able to compensate somewhat for the absence of holograph manuscripts by consulting the so-called commonplace books, or manuscript miscellanies, in which his poems circulated before they were printed in 1633. Such collections abound, and while many of them merely perpetuate scribal errors, all must be scrutinized on the chance that they preserve readings more authoritative than those in the posthumously published editions. The manuscripts not only help establish Donne's text, but also assist in determining the canon of his work and in discovering the nature of his contemporary reputation. Among the contents of Harvard MS. Eng. 686, a commonplace book compiled between 1623 and 1635, occur fifteen items of interest to the student of Donne's text, canon, and reputation. For purposes of discussion the items may be divided into three groups: complete texts of poems by Donne, fragmentary texts of poems by Donne, and complete and fragmentary texts of poems not written by Donne, so far as can be determined, but assigned to him in various early manuscripts. It must be admitted at the outset that MS. Eng. 686 has no authority except its relatively early date. Who the compilers were—two different hands made the entries under consideration—and whether they could have had access to reliable texts of Donne are matters of conjecture. The contents of the manuscript suggest that they were Oxford undergraduates, since many of the poems are concerned with events at Oxford, and several poets who attended Oxford are represented: Strode, Corbet, Wotton, Carew, Heylyn, Morley, Duppa, Barnfield, Freeman, Bastard, Davies, Hoskyns, and others. Whoever the compilers, their tastes were broad; they mingle the sacred and the profane, the local and the national, the salacious and the moral, the naïve and the sophisticated. Their completely "unified" sensibilities show that they were at least capable of appreciating metaphysical verse, and the neatness with which they transcribe even long pieces presupposes some concern for accuracy. Three complete poems of Donne appear in the manuscript: those titled in Sir Herbert Grierson's edition "Elegie XIX. Going to Bed," "Elegie VII," and "To M r S. B." 1 The manuscript attributes only the last to Donne. The other two are signed "John Dean" and "J. Deane" respectively, apparently a confusion of Dean John Donne with a certain John Dean who was a fellow of New College from 1617 to his death in 1626, a contributor to the Queen Anne memorial volume, Academiae Oxoniensis funebria sacra in 1619, and the subject of epitaphs by Robert Gomersall and William Browne. 2 Such a confusion is not uncommon in manuscripts; one between Donne and Dowland is mentioned below. The most interesting of the three complete poems is the untitled copy (pp. 70-72 of the manuscript) of "Going to Bed," for the textual problems of this elegy are greater than those of any other poem by Donne. No single satisfactory text seems to exist. Grierson reproduced the earliest printed copy, that in Donne's Poems (1669), which he, evidently feeling that there was nothing sacred about a text added so late to the canon, emended freely from manuscript versions. The present text differs verbally from his as follows (the Grierson reading is given first): 3 having the foe] having his foe 5 glittering] glistering 7 spangled] spangling which] y t 8 That I may see my Shrine that shines so faire 10 it is] 'tis yo r 11 which] that 12 can be] wilbe 13 reveals] reveale 14 th'hills shadow steales] hils shadowes steale 17 safely] softly 19 us'd] vse 22 Ill] all 23 from] by 24 Those] They 26 Behind, beefore, above, between belowe 27 my new] o my new 28 kingdome, safliest] Kingdome's safest 31 in] into 32 Then] There 33 joyes] eyes 35 which] y t 36 like]as 38 His greedy eyes might court theirs, &amp; not them 39 Like vnto books with gawdy coveringes made 41 mystick] Musick 44 since] sweet The variants are of three kinds. First, those in lines 5, 10, and 36 are shared by all the manuscripts, and it is therefore not unlikely that they are what Donne actually wrote. Second, those in lines 8, 17, and 22 occur in a few manuscripts, but not in a majority, and those in 17 and 28 have the authority of the 1669 text. Grierson knew, but did not adopt, the readings in 8, 17, 22, and 28; yet he adopted others with as little objective justification. Without the help of some such system as Sir Walter Greg's calculus of variants, an editor is left, in a case like this, at the mercy of his own personal taste and judgment. It can be argued, for instance, that the reference in the rejected reading of line 8 to the lover's "Shrine" is as Donnean as, and adumbrates the theological imagery coming later better than, the reference to the outside world and its "busie fooles" in Grierson's reading. Again, "all" seems to go better in line 22 than "Ill" since the distinction between good and evil spirits is made specifically in the next line. All spirits, Donne is saying, appear dressed in white, but the woman in her nightgown and the phantom can be distinguished by their different effects on the man. The same joke turns up later in Robert Baron's Pocula Castalia (1650, p. 132) and in an epigram in John Cotgrave's Wits Interpreter (1655, sig. 2A8 v ). The third class of variants, those in lines 3, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19, 23, 24, 26, 27, 31, 32, 33, 35, 38, 39, 41, 44, are unique to the present text. In dealing with them, one is on less certain ground. Their very number might hint that we are confronting a copy of a version of the poem much earlier than the others, but it might equally well suggest that what we have are merely the results of the carelessness, not to mention the misguided prunings and polishings, of successive scribes. And perhaps every variant in this group is not unique; all the copies have not been collated, nor can they be until a complete census of Donne manuscripts is available. 3 It seems useless to pursue these melancholy reflections further. In addition to the verbal differences, the present copy of the elegy places the couplet beginning "To enter in these bonds" differently from all copies seen by Grierson, where it comes at the end of the geographical passage. Grierson's text reads: My Myne of precious stones, My Emperie, How blest am I in this discovering thee! To enter in these bonds, is to be free; Then where my hand is set, my seal shall be. Full nakedness! All joyes are due to thee, As souls unbodied, bodies uncloth'd must be. In the manuscript the lines in question occur as the penultimate couplet of the poem: . . . cast all, yea this white linnen hence There is noe pennance due to Innocence To enter into these bondes is to be free There where my hand is sett my seale shalbe. Thus the couplet is moved from a passage in which the imagery is otherwise primarily geographical and in which it comes as an anticlimax to a position in which it can reinforce the quasi-legal suggestions of "penance" and "innocence." This arrangement helps to overcome the charge of a recent critic that "the poem never quite assumes shape as an artistic whole." 4 Moreover, the awkwardness of the piling up of the same rhyme, which is uncharacteristic of Donne's elegies, is lessened if the couplet is removed, but is by no means eliminated, for the occurrence of "thee" at the end of two successive lines creates a new awkwardness. Copies of the elegy in Folger MS. 1.27, p. 69, and in Folger MS. 46.2, fol. 30, agree with Eng. 686 in the placing of the couplet, and Folger 46.2 is of further interest in that it avoids the repetition of "thee." It reads: My mine of precious stones my Empery. How blest am I in this discouering thy Full nakednesse, all eyes are due to thee All soules vnbodied, bodyes vncloth'd should bee. If other copies which support the order of these three manuscripts are discovered, editors of Donne will have to consider moving the couplet. As texts, the other complete poems are not so eccentric as the nineteenth elegy. "Vppon a woman whom the Author taught to Love &amp; Complement" (pp. 73-74), a copy of the seventh elegy, has the following verbal variants from Grierson's text: 3 didst ] doest 4 not] &amp; 6 and] nor 9 the] thy 10 they devisefully] their device in 20 his] her 24 a blis-full Paradise] blissfull Paradices 30 then, beeing made a ready] when hees made a better Except for the reading in line 10, which also appears in two other manuscripts, these variants have been hitherto unrecorded. They are probably due to carelessness, though those in lines 24 and 30 may represent attempts to make the meter smoother. "Epigrammes of D r Donnes makinge to M rs S. P." (p. 104) differs verbally from Grierson's text of "To M r S[amuel]. B[rooke]." as follows: 1 to search out] for to search 5 lanch'd into the vast] lanch out into the Both variants are unrecorded. There is justification in contemporary practice for calling the poem an epigram; for instance, Jonson's little verse-letters to or about Donne prefixed to the 1650, 1654, and 1669 editions of Donne had earlier appeared in Jonson's Epigrammes (1616). The second group of texts, the fragmentary pieces, includes a version of lines 27-28 of "Elegie XI. The Bracelet," two copies of a version of lines 35-36 of "Elegie II. The Anagram," and the first stanza of "A Ieat Ring sent" (Grierson, I, 97, 81, 65). The couplet quoted from "The Bracelet" appears (p. 27) as an epigram on clipped French coins, a popular subject of mirth in England: 5 On the French Crownes Although y e King eclepd most Xtīān bee His crownes be circumcis'd most Jewishly. The lines from "The Anagram" (pp. 122, 156) were perhaps valued because they are an expansion of the proverb "Good land, evil way": Beautie is barren oft good husbans say, That land is best, that has the fowlest way[.] Like these couplets, the first stanza of "A Ieat Ring" (p. 102) was probably esteemed for its epigrammatic quality. The presence of these fragments in the manuscript provides further support for the conclusion of W. Milgate, who examined dozens of early references to Donne, that "it was the epigrammatic, the satiric, the rhetorical and the 'witty' in Donne that most appealed to his contemporaries." 6 A final fragment of a poem by Donne is a paraphrase of lines 3-6 of "Breake of day" (Grierson, I, 23) which is added to an unsigned lyric of twelve lines beginning "Stay, sweet, awhile, why doest thou rise" (p. 188): Did wee lye doune because of night And shall wee rise for feare of light Noe since in darkeness wee came hither In spight of light weele lye togeither. The foregoing lines are not so much a corruption of Donne as a conscious attempt to remove his characteristically rough rhythms so that the lyric preceding, which is probably by John Dowland, may flow smoothly into them. Dowland's lyric—if it may be so assigned 7 —was first published in 1612: twelve lines with a setting for solo voice in A Pilgrimes Solace , and a slightly different version of the first six lines with a setting for five voices by Orlando Gibbons in The First Set of Madrigals and Mottets ; Donne's was first printed in 1633. When the two lyrics merged cannot be determined exactly, but the present amalgam is earlier than any of the several combinations in print. It is also unique in joining the entire Dowland poem with only four lines of the Donne. In 1650 a blend made up of the first stanza of Dowland's poem followed by the first stanza of Donne's and concluding with lines 7-8 of Dowland's was printed in The Academy of Complements , 8 and in 1655 two different versions of the same combination, but without the final couplet, appeared in Wits Interpreter (sigs. O7 v , P5). Perhaps taking his cue from the anthologists, the editor of Donne's Poems in 1669 printed a version of Dowland's first stanza at the head of "Breake of day," where it remained in the Donne canon until Sir Edmund Chambers, editing Donne in 1896, disentangled the two poems. In 1686 an eighteen-line piece entitled "A Love Song" appeared in The Loyal Garland ; 9 it consisted of the first stanza of Dowland's poem, the first stanza of Donne's, and the second stanza of Dowland's. The compiler of the Garland was outdone by whoever entered a version containing two stanzas from each poem in MS. Ashmole 47, fol. 73. Grierson (II, cxlviii) enumerates other manuscript copies. The merger of the two poems in so many different combinations is perhaps unusual even in that age of reckless disregard for texts. Chambers suggested that the initials "J. D." in a manuscript may have brought them together, and Grierson pointed out the similarity of their themes: both differ from the usual Renaissance aubade in having a lady as the speaker and in urging the desirability of staying in bed. The similarity of the subjects and the authors' initials are cogent reasons, but they would have been inoperative had not the two poems been singable to the same tune. Perhaps four lines of Donne's poem were first added to Dowland's in order to provide words for a passage repeated in the music, and this arrangement later suggested incorporating an entire stanza in a new setting. The fact that Donne's first stanza is self-contained and that both Dowland's stanzas are so different from each other that they can stand alone as separate poems 10 may have contributed to their mobility. Few people can remember the order of the stanzas of a popular song. At any rate, music suitable for both poems is abundant. In addition to the settings by Gibbons and Dowland, others are preserved in British Museum MS. Additional 29481, fol. 9, in "Queen Elizabeth's Virginal Book," and in "Elizabeth Rogers, hir Virginal Book." 11 Those who reproduced the words seem to have relied for the most part on their faulty memories. Although numerous, the verbal variants are so trivial and so lacking in pattern that close scrutiny of them seems useless. The blending of these two poems constitutes an interesting case history of the effect of music on seventeenth-century poetry. And, like the uses to which the other fragments of Donne's poems in the manuscript were put, it shows no awareness of the metaphysical qualities for which Donne is valued today. The manuscript contains eight poems and fragments which have, in one place or another, been assigned to Donne. Since each of these apocryphal items presents its own individual problems, it has seemed best merely to list them by first line and page in the manuscript and to give them only such annotation as has not before been printed. A sylly John surprizd with joy (p. 74). A doggerel quatrain signed "J Dean," another version of which is preserved among Donne's epigrams in the Carnaby MS. at Harvard, fol. 48 v , with the signature "J. D." Grierson (II, cii) inaccurately reproduced the Carnaby text and rejected the possibility of Donne's authorship. His refusal to assign it to Donne would have been firmer had he known that the quatrain is merely a fragment of the second song in a song-cycle preserved in two manuscript music books, altus and bassus, dated 1637 and once the property of a certain Thomas Smith (J. W. Brown, "An Elizabethan Song-Cycle," The Cornhill Magazine , XLVII [1920], 572-579). The music is assigned to R[ichard]. Nicholson, organist at Magdalen College, 1595-1639; Dean, who is mentioned above, seems to have the best claim to the words. Cach me a star thats fallinge from the sky (p. 106). An unsigned version of an eight-line poem of uncertain authorship modeled on the first stanza of Donne's song beginning "Goe, and catche a fallinge starre." It is incorrectly assigned to Donne himself in Harleian MS. 6057, from which Grierson (II, 12) reproduced it. The present copy is older than any in print. It was first published in two different versions in 1640, with the title "Womans Mutability" in Poems : By Francis Beaumont Gent . (sig. I1 v ), and with the title "On womens inconstancy" in Wits Recreations (sig. E3). Other copies not mentioned by Grierson appear in John Fry's Pieces of Ancient Poetry (1814, p. 7) and in MS. Ashmole 47, fol. 36. They all differ. These redactions were more popular than Donne's original lyric. Cruell, since thou dost [ not ] feare the curse (p. 102). An unsigned copy of a poem attributed to Donne in the O'Flahertie manuscript (Harvard MS. Norton 4504, p. 52), from which it was printed by Grierson (I, 466). Another anonymous copy which Grierson did not see appears in the Parnell-Thomas Burton manuscript at Harvard, fols. 17-19. There are many verbal variants. Grierson did not weigh Donne's claim, which is admittedly slight; the parallels to his elegies could as readily indicate imitation as his own authorship. If shaddowes be a pictures excellence (pp. 182-183, 189). The manuscript contains two anonymous copies (the second fragmentary) of this witty poem which was first included in the Donne canon by Sir John Simeon, Unpublished Poems of John Donne (1856, pp. 19-21). It was rejected by Grierson (II, 268-269), who, however, printed in his appendix (I, 460-461) a manuscript copy assigned to Donne. Other claimants include Rudyerd ( Poems , ed. John Donne, Jr., 1660, pp. 61-62), Walton Poole (A. H. Bullen, Speculum Amantis , 1902, pp. 30-31), and Jonson (W. D. Briggs, "Studies in Ben Jonson," Anglia , XXXIX [1915], 231-232). Wits Interpreter (1655, sig. R3) and Parnassus Biceps (1656, pp. 75-77) published it anonymously. Whoever the author, he was a close imitator of Donne. The various copies differ greatly from each other. O Love whose force and might (pp. 72-73). An unsigned, seven-stanza version of a popular nonsense song which appears in the manuscript in the midst of pieces attributed to John Dean. Grierson (II, c-ci) found it among Donne's poems in a manuscript collection owned by Captain C. Shirley Harris. Though it is certainly unlike Donne, its presence among his poems can be explained if we posit a manuscript copy signed "J. D." The fullest discussion of the poem is that of Louise Brown Osborn, who reproduces a manuscript version attributed to Hoskyns in The Life, Letters, and Writings of John Hoskyns (1937, p. 301). She lists several other manuscripts, one of which identifies the author as Robert Polden of New College, Oxford. It also appears anonymously in six different seventeenth-century anthologies. The textual problems are exceedingly complex, since it exists in a great variety of forms. What is our life? A play of Passion (pp. 33, 134). Two unsigned copies of a sententious epigram probably by Ralegh, both differing from each other and from those described by Agnes Latham, The Poems of Sir Walter Ralegh (1929, pp. 161-162). For a discussion of Donne's very feeble claim, see Grierson (I, 441; II, 268). Whosoe tearmes loue a fier may licke a poet (p. 104). This poem, which precedes a copy of Donne's verse letter to Brooke, has been printed only once, by Grierson (II, 52), in a note to Donne's elegy "The Paradox." Grierson reproduced the copy in a manuscript at Trinity College, Cambridge, and noted three other manuscript occurrences. It is also preserved in two Harvard manuscripts of Donne, Norton 4503, fol. 71 v , and Parnell-Thomas Burton, pp. 13-15, and in MS. Ashmole 47, fol. 34. The present copy is headed as follows: A paradox of D r Donne Makinge: O my soule, my harte doth bourne to be soe neare &amp; louse soe good a turne Whether the couplet at the right of the title is meant to be taken as Donne's is difficult to decide. At any rate, it is the final couplet of a lewd poem referred to by Hippolita in John Day's The Isle of Guls (1602, sig. D3), versions of which may be seen in Oxford Drollery (1671, sig. 18 v ) and in W. Tod Ritchie's edition of The Bannatyne Manuscript (1930, IV, 279). As for the poem itself, there seems to be no claimant other than Donne, though one hesitates to assign it to him because its theme, that the marine origin of Venus is a paradox, is so commonplace; it occurs, for instance in epigrams by Muretus ( Delitiae delitiarum , ed. Abraham Wright, 1632, p. 28), by Timothy Kendall ( Flowers of Epigrammes , 1577, sig. F8 v ), by John Owen ( Epigrammatum . . . libri tres , 1612, sig. A7 v ), and by Edward May ( Epigrams Divine and Moral , 1633, sig. C2 v ). There is certainly nothing metaphysical about the poem, and if it is by Donne, it must be an early work. You say I lie, I say you lie (p. 122). An indecorous trifle, here unsigned, but in MS. Ashmole 47, fol. 36, headed "Dr. Dunn to a gentlewoman." The present copy, interestingly enough, directly precedes the couplet from "The Anagram" discussed above; perhaps in the source used by the scribe both pieces were assigned to Donne. Since there is no evidence that Donne wrote "You say I lie" —though he was as capable of punning on "lie" as any Elizabethan—its ascription to him illustrates the practice of attaching his name to any floating scrap of bawdry. In this respect Donne's reputation in the earlier seventeenth century is similar to Rochester's in the later. This rhyme sometimes appears as part of a little dialogue in verse, different versions of which appear anonymously in Wits Recreations (1640, sig. F5) and in The Academy of Complements (1663, sig. G9), and as the work of Ralegh in W. C. Hazlitt and Henry Huth's Inedited Poetical Miscellanies (1870, sig. M4). Miss Latham, The Poems of Sir Walter Ralegh (1951, p. 174), calls attention to the Donne ascription but makes no decision. The preceding list comes so far from exhausting the entire Donne apocrypha that no valid generalizations can be drawn from it. But if all the items misassigned to Donne were to be collected and examined, we would discover much more about his contemporary reputation than we are told by the scattered, perfunctory references to him that have so far been gathered.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Lord Hailes's Contributions to Contemporary Magazines by Robert Hay Carnie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Only a meagre number of magazine articles are attributed to Lord Hailes in the most complete printed list of his published works, 1 despite the fact that there are several important contemporary references which draw attention to his activity in this field. 2 His extant manuscripts 3 also point to the fact that he wrote a considerable number more magazine articles than have previously been assigned to him. This article attempts to list those contributions which the present writer believes can be definitely attributed to Hailes. Few writers in the 18th Century were so mindful of their literary reputations as to keep lists of those articles which they sent anonymously to the magazines. Some of those who did keep lists, and Hailes's friend, the Earl of Buchan, 4 is a good example, did so from a strong desire for posthumous literary fame. If we may judge from the number of his larger published works which Hailes sent out into the world without his name on the title-page, such vanity was largely absent from his character. It is certain that he regarded his magazine articles as being ephemeral productions, unworthy of collection. This characteristic modesty, combined with the fact that the opportunity of utilising contemporary information on the subject was neglected by the would-be biographers of Hailes, 5 working immediately after his death, adds to the difficulty of a present-day investigation. Hailes was not, unfortunately, one of these anonymous contributors who used a settled nom-de-plume , and in his case, the study of signatures proves more of a hindrance than a help. Hans Hecht suggested that both Hailes and David Herd, the song collector, contributed to magazines above the initials D. H. 6 He does not list any articles by Hailes signed in this way as proof of this assertion. I have found no article, with these initials below, which could be definitely ascribed to Hailes. On the other hand, Richar d Goug h , the English antiquary, wrote a large number of articles for the Gentleman's Magazine signed D. H. and this further complication is not noted by Hecht. One might expect Sir Davi d Dalrympl e , Lord Hailes, to use the initials D. E., but I have only found articles by David Erskine, Earl of Buchan using this signature. 7 One article, definitely by Hailes, in the Edinburgh Magazine or Literary Miscellany is signed 'G', but I have traced no others by him signed in this way. The nom-de-plume 'Antiquarius' appears often under articles in the Scots Magazine and the Gentleman's Magazine , and Hailes did use this signature for one of his anonymous essays in Henry Mackenzie's Mirror . 8 But the articles signed 'Antiquarius' in the Scots Magazine are manifestly from a variety of pens, while in the Gentleman's Magazine 'Antiquarius' is very often the signature of John Loveday, the English antiquary. 9 In view of this confusion, and of the dangers of ascribing articles to any one writer on purely internal evidence, I have excluded from my list those many articles which I thought might be by Hailes on the unsupported evidence of general style and content, and have included only those in which such internal evidence is corroborated in some way from Hailes's manuscripts or books. 10 Only two MS drafts of previously unknown articles have come to my notice, both being preserved by that assiduous collector, David Laing. 11 The greatest number of new articles are to be found in Sibbald's Edinburgh Magazine or Literary Miscellany , which was perhaps to be expected, as Hailes's friendship with Sibbald 12 was a close one. Sibbald is thought to be the author of the obituary notice of Hailes which appeared in that magazine in March 1793. It makes the point: "the pages of our miscellany have also been enriched by his learned communications." This fact has been noted by nearly all Hailes's biographers, but no previous attempt has been made to establish which 'learned communications' were, in fact, his. What motives and circumstances were at work when Hailes sent anything to the publishers of the periodical magazines, and what type of material he considered suitable for this mode of publication, can be deduced from the following list. His magazine articles reflect many facets of his more substantial work, and throw considerable light on his character. Hailes printed several collections of historical documents for the benefit of the historical scholar, 13 and was a Scottish pioneer in this field. It was his practice, if one can judge from some of the items below, to send a few very short documents of this nature to the magazines. Such articles are very difficult to ascribe to any one source, for they provide no stylistic guide. Two are given to Hailes on the basis of external evidence. Hailes also sent in a few notes requesting historical information, or offering specimens of his own works, in the hope of eliciting further information from other scholars. 14 This was merely an extension of his habit of sending specimens of his works privately to his friends for their advice and criticism. The personal method was on one occasion used when a more general appeal through the magazines had failed. 15 Occasionally Hailes was inspired to write a reply to an article in a previous number which had given erroneous information, or had upset his prejudices, though he cannot be accused of indulging in anonymous scurrility, for the tone of such replies was always dignified, and such letters occasionally carried his full signature. 16 Knowledge of Hailes's historical ideals, and of his distinctive argumentative style, combined with other information, helped to identify articles of this nature. As distinct from articles of the kind described above, Hailes does not seem to have regarded the magazines as a suitable repository for original literary work. He shared with his correspondent, Horace Walpole, a dislike of seeing his original literary compositions included in their pages. Walpole makes this clear when he says in a letter to Hailes: "I thank you, Sir, for the curiosity you sent me, and more for the elegy printed upon it. You need not fear my letting it pass into the magazines; nobody has more aversion to those dirt-carts and their drivers: my poor Hentzner fell into their hands before I had even time to give it to my friends. It almost frightens me from saving any curiosities for the public, when one is sensible that the public attends to nothing but what is laid at their doors by those scavengers." 17 Many of the Latin elegies and English poems preserved among Hailes's papers might have found their way into the poetry sections of the magazines if Hailes had not preferred to keep them for the perusal of his friends. The standard of Latin verse achieved in these manuscripts 18 was of a higher level than that usually printed in the magazines; the English verse was at least as bad as the worst to be found in the Gentleman's Magazine . The literary value of the letters and notes sent by Hailes to the magazines is negligible compared with their historical and antiquarian interest. They do illustrate, however, thoughts, and habits of style, which appear again in his more important work. Knotty and controverted points of Scottish history and of early Christian antiquities were debated in his century with more vigour and personal thrust than would be the case to-day. I have already suggested that Hailes was uniformly polite in such debates, but he was wont to use a quiet, distinctive, and effective irony, which combined well with his unusual style. This style was singular but dignified; he avoided long complex sentences, and combined a disjointed mode of sentence structure with an almost Tacitean abruptness. He used balance and antithesis a great deal, but largely avoided parenthetical constructions. Very short paragraphs are another feature of his style. He accompanied these stylistic devices with a most deceiving appearance of simplicity and lack of guile. Hailes has the disarming habit of quoting his opponent as if he was taking what he says at its face value, and then blandly demonstrating the weaknesses in the reasoning. This type of writing, which is not particularly suited for long works, was very effective in controversies conducted by letters in magazines. The following points should be noticed with reference to the list. a) Extracts from Hailes's published works are only included when they appear as separate articles, and not when quoted as part of a review of the work in question. b) Republication by the magazine of his legal speeches, from published collections of such speeches, are included, but not direct reports made in Court. The latter are very rarely verbatim , and can hardly be considered Hailes's own work. c) I have included republished extracts from Hailes's published works, even in those cases where there is no evidence that the republication had his consent. THE EDINBURGH MAGAZINE OR LITERARY MISCELLANY. 1785-1803. 1. Volume II (Dec.), 1785, pp. 347-351. "Specimen of the Life of the Marquis of Montrose, 1644." (This fairly long article can definitely be ascribed to Hailes. It corresponds to the Specimen 'Life of Montrose' mentioned by Kay's Edinburgh Portraits [1870 ed. p. 370] and is a narrative of Montrose's military campaigns in 1644. In 1780, Hailes had sent a specimen of his 'history' dealing with these campaigns to Bp. Hurd, and a recent researcher at Newhailes has described such a pamphlet he saw there as a specimen of Annals of Scotland from the Union of the Crowns to the Restoration . 19 Hailes never completed the larger work, and probably sent the sheets to Sibbald when he realised that this would be the case. The article certainly reads rather as history than biography.) *2. Volume II (Dec.), 1785, pp. 376-382. "Extracts from Miscellaneous Remarks on the 'Inquiry into the Evidence against Mary, Queen of Scots' ." 20 (The proofs of Hailes's authorship of the anonymous tract from which these extracts are taken are as follows. A.F. Tytler first attributed the work, published in 1784, to Hailes in a manuscript pamphlet [Laing Collection. E.U.L.]. His arguments, based largely on stylistic comparisons with Hailes's signed work, were sound, but the matter was placed beyond all doubt by a note appended by Laing to Tytler's MS: "Mr. Th. Thomson to whom I sent this paper acknowledged his conviction that the evidence against his friend Lord Hailes was all but demonstration; and sometime afterwards he met with that demonstration having found a few scraps of the MS of the Misc. Remarks in Lord Hailes handwriting among his lordship's loose papers. These he showed me in Jan 1833." These scraps do not seem to have survived. Hailes nowhere in his published work, or his correspondence, refers directly to the book. But there may be a veiled reference to it in a letter from A. Kippis, March 17, 1787 (Newhailes MSS 702), where Kippis promises to keep the authorship of an unnamed tract by Hailes secret. Many other articles relating to the "Marian controversy" 21 are to be found in the pages of this magazine, and quite a few of these, on stylistic evidence, may have come from Hailes's pen, but have been excluded for want of corroborative evidence.) *3. Volume III (Jan.), 1786, pp. 17-19. (This article signed 'E', is a reply to another on the "Pillars at Aberlemno", December, 1785, pp. 346-394. There is a strong similarity to the views held and stated by Hailes elsewhere, in the central paragraph of the article: "But we have been too long the slaves of tradition in antiquarian researches. Perhaps in this age of freedom we may be allowed to doubt the existence of the battle of Luncarty, and we certainly know that Hay (de la Haie) was a Norman family; that the court armorial of that family, more eminent for its merits than its antiquity was three red shields, not three bloody ploughshares." etc. This paragraph is very similar in idea and expression to a letter of Hailes to James Beattie. 30th Oct. 1778 [Beattie MSS Aberdeen]: "no poetical merit can ever, in my eyes, justify a Poem that alludes to the Hays of Luncarty — it is the fable of fables. ye name is not Hay , but de Haye or de la Haye : a Norman family: the three red shields have no connection with any implement of husbandry." This should again be compared with a letter from Hailes to Buchan, 16th March 1782 [Perth Literary Society MSS. Perth Art Gallery]: "The seal of ye family of Errol will I hope be the last and deadly blow at the fable of Luncarty which has too long disgraced our Annals, if my historical labours could have convinced my countrymen and obliged them to acknowledge that fable to be a fable, I should have esteemed my labours not lost, for it is a main beam in an old system which I wish to pull to pieces, and to erect a system from record in its room." The insistence of the three items on the same idea is significant.) *4. Volume III (Feb.), 1786, pp.104-105. "Two letters by Sarah, Duchess Dowager of Marlborough." (The presence of these two letters of the Duchess in a Scottish magazine almost certainly means that Hailes sent them. Hailes had the Duchess's letters to the Earl of Stair, and published from them his Opinions volume in 1788. He had this material as early as 1779, for he quotes from it in his Mirror , Paper No. 21. One other possible source of such letters was Hailes's friend, the Earl of Seafield, in whose archives are letters from the Duchess [Hist. MSS. Comm. Report, 1894, p.227.]. But I have no evidence that Seafield ever sent anything to the magazines.) 5. Volume III (April), 1786, p.218. "On Argyle's Levee - whether written by Lord Binning." (This article is definitely by Hailes. It is an expansion of a note to be found in an MS commonplace-book [Newhailes MSS, No. 457]. Hailes was of course the son of Christian Hamilton, the sister of Lord Binning. Sir Wm. Fraser in his Haddington Book [I, 266] ascribes the article, which is signed 'G', to Hailes, presumably on the basis of evidence at Tyninghame.) *6. Volume IV (Sept.), 1786, p. 208. "A Latin epigram on Samuel Johnson and James Boswell." (A MS copy of the poem can be found amongst Hailes's papers [Newhailes MSS, No. 470]. As the epigram is very short I include it here. "Auspice Bosvello magnus Johsonus Edinae Per trivias, dubia luce, tenebat iter; Cum subito a patulis, patrio de more, fenestris Irruit effusa foetidus imber aqua. At ridens immane Sophus, Nunc, Scotia, praesens Es mihi; nam certe me tuus afflat odor." 7. Volume IV (Oct.), 1786, pp. 279-280. "Extracts from the poems of George Wither." (A letter from Bishop Hurd, dated 23rd Oct. 1786 [Newhailes MSS, No. 251], reveals that this article was by Hailes. Interest in Wither was not high in this century, but Hailes was here sharing a family interest; for his younger brother Alexander, the famous hydrographer, printed in 1785, Extracts from Wither's Juvenilia , and there is a collection of A. Dalrymple's MS notes on Wither's poems in the British Museum.) *8. Volume V (Jan.), 1787, p. 31. "Letter on Scottish Portraits." (The reference in this article to Walpole's opinion on the authenticity of the Burlington portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots, clinches this identification. The question is discussed in Walpole's letters to Hailes [cf. Yale XV : to Hailes, 8th Nov. 1767, and n. 26. p. 113]. The letter in which Walpole indicated a change of mind does not seem to have survived.) *9. Volume VII (March), 1788, pp. 153-155. "Strictures on Sir John Dalrymple's Memoirs." (This article defends, as does a later article in the same magazine, Hailes's ancestor, Stair, against criticisms made of his conduct. Sir John Dalrymple was a full cousin of Hailes, and we perhaps are given the reason for the anonymity of this article when Hailes says in a letter to Buchan, 20th May 1782 [Laing MSS, II, 588]: "I should not be unwilling to undertake a life of ye Viscount Stair were I assisted by his other descendants: there is one thing, however which is embarrasing: were I to undertake that work, I should be under the necessity of contradicting point blank almost every word that Sir John Dalrymple has said concerning his great Ancestor." The fact that Hailes wrote this article is placed beyond doubt by a letter from Sir John Pringle to Hailes 22nd March 1778 [Newhailes MSS, No. 327], in which Sir John says that he had taken up certain points with regard to a passage in Sir John Dalrymple with Lady Dundas, and these are some of the points discussed in this article. There is a further article on Sir J. Dalrymple's ' Memoirs ' in the magazine for February, 1788, p. 122, and it is possible that this is also by Hailes.) *10. Volume VIII (Sept.), 1788, pp. 172-173. "Letter from King James to the Laird of Balmuto." (The actual draft sent by Hailes to the publisher is extant [Laing MSS, III, 352.]. The text is not in Hailes's autograph, but in that of a scribe. On the back however, in Hailes's own hand, we find the words "For Mr. Sibbald's magazine." This is an excellent example of the sort of document that Hailes would send to the magazines, which cannot be identified unless the draft is recovered.) *11. Volume VIII (Oct.), 1788, pp. 243-244. "Article on MOTTOES." (A draft of this is also to be found amongst the Laing MSS [III, 352], and is completely in the handwriting of Lord Hailes. Neither this draft nor the one above is included as by Hailes in the printed catalogue of the Laing MSS; both were found by accident. 22 ) *12. Volume IX (Feb.), 1789, pp. 124-130. "Extracts from the Opinions of Sarah, Duchess Dowager of Marlborough ." (Alexander Dalrymple, Hailes's brother, was not of the opinion that Hailes edited this work. He says so in a letter to George Chalmers (B.M. ADD MSS. 22900. f. 253). But Alexander Dalrymple was, on his own admission, not in close touch with Hailes in the latter part of his life. That Hailes had material concerning the Duchess in his hands is evidenced by his Mirror essay No. 21. The editor of Private Correspondence of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough of the Court and Times of Queen Anne , 1837, 2 vols, prints the Opinions , and states that they are extracts from the letters of the Duchess to Lord Stair, Hailes's ancestor.) *13. Volume IX (April), 1789, p. 219. "Letter to the publisher on the Letters of the Dowager Duchess of Orleans . p. 171." (This article is given to Hailes on strong evidence of style, and similarity of theme to known work of Hailes. The key paragraph is the following: "In the last century, Varillas, Raguenet, Courtiltz, and others disgraced the name of Historian in France, by their fabulous publications, and I am afraid that their race is not extinct. As the passion for anecdotes increases, readers will become more careless in thus investigating their truth; and needy and unprincipled men will be always ready to profit by the credulity of the public. It will afford much employment for the next age to detect what Voltaire himself, a master workman, terms Les mensonges imprimis of this age." The views outlined in this paragraph are typical of Hailes, and what is more the French historians here chosen for censure were always his favourite examples of 'Fabulous historians'. Many parallel passages could be given from his attested work, of which the best are as follows (cf. Introduction to his Memorials and Letters relating to the History of Britain in the reign of James I , 1766 ed.): "When indeed writers, like Varillas, Raguenet, and Leti, deliberately impose upon the world by the recital of what never happened; when they display their eloquence by celebrating actions which their heroes did not perform; and their political knowledge, by tracing out the causes of imaginary events; such writers will have little occasion for the services of the humble compiler; and if ever they should think fit to appeal to original papers, they can, as Varillas did, forge authorities, as well as facts." Also a letter to Walpole 5th July 1758 [ Walpole Letters , Yale ed., XV, 31]: "The subject pleased me, and I set about it myself. From the French authors I collected some very pretty battles which were never fought, and drew a character or two of heroes who never existed." Prof. Hoover states in a footnote that he has seen the MS of this unfinished jeu d'esprit , and the authorities cited in the margin are Leti, and Raguenet. A letter to James Boswell, 2nd Dec. 1763 [MS Yale], says of Voltaire: "C'est le conteur le plus intrepide qui s'est trouve en Europe depuis le siecle des Varilas, des Leti et des Raguenets." These quotations definitely prove that Hailes was the author of this article.) *14. Volume IX (June), 1789, pp. 389-396. "Extracts from Lord Hailes's Memorials and Letters relating to the History of Britain in the Reign of James I ", second edition 1766. (I know of no reason why Sibbald should have decided to reprint the letters of the Duke of Buckingham at this time. They are certainly amongst the most interesting in the volume, and the ones most likely to arouse political feeling amongst the readers.) *15. Volume XI (April), 1790, pp. 219-220. "Letter to the Publisher on a 'Life of Charles Edward Stuart.'" (This letter can be definitely ascribed to Hailes for precisely the same reason as No. 13 was. It is anti-Jacobite, as one would expect from Hailes, and the quiet tone of irony is extremely typical. The key passage for recognition, however, again contains the magic names of the fabulous French and Italian historians: "One would have thought that the principal events in the life of that unfortunate man were tolerably well known, and that it would have been no difficult matter to have related them accurately; yet he has found a historian who treads in the steps of Raguenet, Leti and Voltaire." This should be compared with the parallel passages quoted under 13. Numbers 13 and 15 are so close in style that they were obviously written by the same man.) 16. Volume XIII (Jan.), 1791, pp. 53-56. "Extract from the Life of John Hamilton, Secular priest ." (This is a reprint of part of the Life of Hamilton which Hailes wrote in 1784. This quarto Life was one of his specimens of his proposed Biographia Scotica . 23 ) EDINBURGH MAGAZINE AND REVIEW 1773-1776. *17. Volume I (Jan.), 1774, p. 181. "Some circumstances concerning the Insurrection of the Commons in the Reign of Richard II. which have been either overlooked or misunderstood by our later historians." (In Hailes's Specimen of Notes on the Statute Law of Scotland , 1768, the story of Wat Tyler and Jack Straw being one and the same person, as outlined in this article, is also to be found. Reference is also made to the story in a letter from Walpole to Hailes, October 26, 1768, where the Statute Notes are under discussion [ Walpole Letters , Yale ed., XV (1952), 123]. Lewis and Hoover's note to this passage is a little confusing. They say that the Tyler-Straw story is not to be found in any copy of the Statute Notes which the editors have seen. They are certainly not mentioned in the printed Specimen sent to the Scots Magazine in May, 1768, but the copies of the Specimen which Hailes distributed amongst his friends are longer than the Scots Magzine specimen, and contain the 'Jack Straw — Wat Tyler note.) 18. Volume I (Feb.), 1774, pp. 235-238. "Of the Latin Poems of Dr. Pitcairne." (Nearly all the previous authorities attribute this article to Hailes. Hailes's own notes and letters reveal a strong interest in, and knowledge of, Dr. Pitcairne [e.g. Letters to Buchan, E.U.L. and Newhailes MSS 445]. There is a short memoir of Pitcairne in the Edinburgh Magazine [May, 1774, p. 364] which ends with this note: "In the fifth number of the Edinburgh Magazine , the curious reader may see a continual commentary on many of the Doctor's poems, for which the editors are indebted to a most accomplished scholar and acute critic." Such a paragraph shows that Stuart and Smellie valued Hailes's contributions highly, but does not suggest that he was a regular correspondent.) *19. Volume IV (Aug.), 1775, pp. 474-475. "A Letter from Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, containing Remarks on a Passage in Mr. MacPherson's History ." (Hailes originally seems to have intended this protest for a different audience than the readers of the Edinburgh Magazine , for he sent a letter to J. Boswell 15th April 1775 [Yale MSS]: "I therefore have drawn up a short letter to be inserted in ye London Chronicle or if you please in any daily Paper: My aim was to be as polite and calm as possible, so that what I have said must be printed without ye smallest variation." On June 29th, 1775 he sent a further letter to J. Boswell [Yale MSS] asking for a letter to be inserted in the "English Magazine of which you are a proprietor" i.e. the London Magazine .) SCOTS MAGAZINE. 1739 to present day. *20. Volume XVII (Sept.), 1755, pp. 424-425. The World . 140. 'Meditation among Books.' (The Scots Magazine reprinted many of the best periodical essays of the day, and gave them a wider circulation. This is the only one of Hailes's essays to be so honoured. Cf. fn. 8.) 21. Volume XXX (May), 1768, pp. 225-228. "Letter and Specimen of Notes on the Statute Law." (Laing assigns this to Hailes, and the evidence of the later enlarged specimens of the same work, 24 which Hailes distributed amongst lawyer friends, puts the matter beyond any doubt. I append here the introductory letter as an example of his most formal type of letter writing: "For some time past I have been engaged in drawing up Notes on the Statute Law of Scotland, from the first Parliament of James I to the Accession of James VI. My purpose is to explain uncommon and obsolete words, to offer conjectures as to the import of obscure expressions, to illustrate law by history, and, as far as may be practicable, to delineate the state of Scotland, and the manners of the Scottish nation, during the 15th and 16th centuries. It must occur to those who are acquainted with Sir George MacKenzie's Observations on the Acts of Parliament, that notes drawn up on this plan, will seldom interfere with his work. The specimen of Notes subjoined will explain the nature and tendency of my undertaking. It is impossible for me to execute it without the aid of the learned and of the lovers of antiquity. By the channel of your magazine, I flatter myself that I may obtain information and assistance." Hailes informs us in the preface to his enlarged specimen that he received but one reply to this request.) *22. Volume XXXII (March), 1770, p. 150. "Letter to the author of the Scots magazine." (The legal paper in which Hailes was attacked was called the Supplemental Case for Sir Robert Gordon . This was the paper opposed to Hailes's own famous Additional Case for the Countess of Sutherland , 1770.) *23. Volume XXXIII (May), 1771, p. 226 et seq. "Extracts from ' Additional Case ' 'The Claims for the Honours of Sutherland.'" (This case did not arouse as much attention as the Douglas Cause, but was one of the most famous of the Scottish 18th-century civil causes. It made Hailes's reputation as a peerage lawyer.) *24. Volume XXXV (March), 1773, p. 120. "A Card concerning the meaning of 'Castrum Puellarum'." (This is a short signed query note upon a point of Scottish antiquity. The answers which Hailes received, p. 222 and p. 240, are signed R. H. and T. W. respectively. They do not seem to be entirely satisfactory. The query probably arose from Hailes's historical work Remarks on the History of Scotland , 1773, Chapter II, p. 76, where Hailes discusses 'Castrum Puellarum' and does not commit himself as to whether it means 'Edinburgh.') *25. Volume XXXVI (Jan.), 1774, p. 9. "Extracts from the case concerning Literary Property." (These extracts are from the published speeches of the judges in this case. The extracts from Hailes's opinion start on p. 9. The judgements, given on July 27th, 1773, were a great step in freeing Scottish printers from the Monopoly of the London booksellers.) *26. Volume LIII, Supplement, 1791, p. 361. "Hailes's Letter to the Royal College of Physicians." (This letter was not printed by Hailes, but was printed, with his permission, by the College [see letter from J. Gregory to Lord Hailes, 1st Nov. 1791—Newhailes MSS, No. 663].) *27. Volume LVI (Nov.), 1794, p. 678. "Extracts from 'Memorials' Second Edition 1766." (N. B. these extracts were printed after Hailes's death.) *28. Volume LXII (Feb.), 1800, p. 87. "Letter from Lord Hailes to Lord Buchan." (This letter deals with anecdotes concerning the Life of Fletcher of Saltoun . A copy of the letter here printed, in Buchan's hand, has survived in the Laing Collection [Laing II, 588]. Buchan used the material given in the letter in his printed ' Life ', 1792. He uses Hailes's words almost verbatim.) THE GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE (1731-1833, First Series). *29. Volume LIX (Dec.), 1789, p. 1076. "Letter on the preservation of the relics at Boscobel House." Signed 'Philarchaeus'. (The writer of this article, who is disappointed in the state of preservation of the relics of Charles I such as the Royal Oak, makes suggestions for improvement. He states that he had personally visited Boscobel. In a letter from Bishop Hurd to Lord Hailes, 4th October 1786 [Laing, II, 588], Hurd inquires after Hailes's recent visit to England, and particularly concerning his visit to Boscobel, of which Hailes had said nothing in his last letter. Hurd doubts that Hailes "made no discoveries there and received but little entertainment".) 30. Volume LX, Pt. 2 (Aug.), 1790, pp. 679-680. "Remarks on the Tatler " (The Introductory letter to the extracts by J. Nichols names Sir David Dalrymple as the author. Further remarks on the " Tatler " continuing those on pp. 679-680, are to be found in the same volume on the following pages, pp. 783-784, p. 901, pp. 992-993, p. 1073, pp. 1163-64. These are in the September, October, November, December, and Supplementary Magazines.) *31. Volume LXI, Pt. 1 (Jan.), 1791, p. 8. "Letter on Dryden, Pope and Fairy Rings" Signed Dav. Dalrymple. 32. Volume LXI, Pt. 1 (May), 1791, pp. 399-400. "Letter on Milton miniature." (This letter to Mr. Urban is unsigned, but the fact that Hailes was the author was first stated in his obituary notice in the Gentleman's Magazine , LXXII, 1154. The letter is replied to by one signed R.J.— Sir Joshua Reynolds — LXI, Pt. 2, pp. 603-605, and there is a further letter by Hailes in the magazine for October, pp. 885-887.) THE WEEKLY MAGAZINE OR EDINBURGH AMUSEMENT, 1768-1784. *33. 1774, July 28th, p. 129. "Letter to the Publisher of the Weekly Magazine, signed 'Arctophylax.'" (Hailes sent this query note at the request of his correspondent, Daines Barrington, with whom he shared a knowledgeable love of antiquities. In a letter to Hailes, Aug. 26th, 1774 [Newhailes MSS 586], Barrington thanks Hailes for circulating his query in the proper places, and for having it printed in the Weekly Magazine "with an exhortation to your countrymen to communicate any information they may have on the subject.") LONDON MAGAZINE. 34. Volume XLIV (July), 1775, p. 330. "Letter to the Editor on Mr. Macpherson's History ." (The story of this contribution is told in the letters between James Boswell and Hailes [Yale MSS]. Boswell's connection with the magazine is well known. On 29th June 1775, Hailes writes: "A thing of this kind would be buried in a news Paper, and I want that a Book, which will last as long as Mr. McPherson's, may give evidence that what he says of Sr David Dalrymple was not taken for granted by all his readers. I have endeavoured to be as smooth as possible, because I do not like altercations." 25 The letter as given in the London Magazine is a conciser version than the others. It was accompanied by an editorial note: "The proprietors of the London Magazine think themselves greatly honoured by the correspondence of Lord Hailes. They beg leave to solicit a continuance of it, when his Lordship, either from duty or inclination, chuses to employ a pen to which the public is much indebted. All attention will be paid to whatever he is pleased to communicate.") LONDON CHRONICLE, 1775, April. *35. "Letter to the Publisher on MacPherson's History ." (This should be compared with the numbers 19 and 34. It is probably the original version of this letter. It is given as Appendix III to the Correspondence of James Boswell and Lord Hailes , ed. C. Weis [Yale University Thesis, 1952]. I have not had access to a copy of this newspaper and my information is taken from Dr. Weis.) NEWCASTLE GENERAL MAGAZINE. *36. Volume III (Nov.), 1750, p. 586. "The speech of Paul the Apostle to the Athenians. Acts Ch. xvii. verse 22 paraphrased." (A MS seen at Newhailes in 1939 by Professor A. G. Hoover, Oberlin College, Ohio, called 'Notes of my Endeavours to serve the Public' reveals the fact that Hailes edited the volume called Sacred Poems : or Collections of Translations and Paraphrases from the Holy Scriptures , Edinburgh, 1751, and that he wrote the Preface and three paraphrases. These were the Paraphrases of the 50th and 112th Psalms, and this item reprinted from the Newcastle Magazine .)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 That by David Laing which accompanies his article on Lord Hailes in the Encyclopœdia Britannica (7th Edition, 1883). This article was also published as a separate octavo pamphlet, and a copy of this in the National Library of Scotland has a few MS corrections in Laing's hand. An important unprinted check-list of Hailes's publications is that given as an Appendix to Correspondence of Horace Walpole and Lord Hailes, ed. A. G. Hoover (Yale University Thesis, 1939). Neither of these lists is complete either for separate publications or magazine articles. Magazine articles not listed by either of the above have been starred * in the following list. There are twenty-seven starred items. 2 Edinburgh Magazine or Literary Miscellany , New Series, I. March), 1793, 167-169. 'Obituary notice of Lord Hailes.' cf. also Alexander Dalrymple to George Chalmers, 16th Aug., 1794, British Museum Add. MSS. 22900. f. 243. 3 A very considerable bulk of letters to Lord Hailes, a few letters by him, and a number of commonplace books and drafts of his published works have been preserved at Newhailes, near Musselburgh. Sir Mark Dalrymple, Bart., of Newhailes has made microfilms of these MSS available for study in the National Library of Scotland. Where I have used this material my reference, e.g. Newhailes 227, is to the microfilm number in the N. L. S. 4 David Steuart Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan (1742-1829). This extraordinary man, best known as the founder of the Scottish Society of Antiquaries, collected some of his magazine articles in Anonymous and Fugitive Essays collected from Various Works , Vol. I, Edinburgh, 1812. He planned a second volume, and his manuscript collection for this has been recently acquired by Edinburgh University Library. (Information from C. Finlayson, Keeper of MSS. E.U.L.) 5 Chief of these was Thomas Thomson (1768-1852). Thomson was one of Scotland's great record scholars and was a friend of Sir walter Scott. Thomson had the support of the family in his plan to write a memoir and produce an edition, but he never completed the work. Cf. C. Innes, Life of Thomas Thomson (Edinburgh, 1854): Bannatyne Club Publications, 99, p. 40 et seq. George Chalmers, the Edinburgh antiquary, also intended a life and took some steps to collect materials from William Cooke, Dean of Ely and Hailes's master at Eton, and from Alexander Dalrymple. Cf. Letter Cooke to Dr. Foster. 1795 (N.L.S. MSS, vol. no. 2956.) D. Laing's 'Miscellaneous Notes on Authors' (E.U.L. Laing Collection) tells us that one Thomas Edward Ritchie intended to include Hailes in a series of biographies and applied to Lady Hailes for permission. The work was not produced, though Ritchie wrote an account of a more famous Scot in his An Account of the Life and Writings of David Hume (London, 1807). I think it not impossible that Laing confused T. E. Ritchie with William Ritchie, (1781-1831) who planned, at the age of 21, a Biographia Scotica which he never completed, just as Hailes himself failed to complete his own projected work in the same field. Cf. D.N.B. (1885-1900 ed.), vol. 48, p. 325. 6 Songs from David Herd's Manuscripts , ed. Hans Hecht (1904), Intro. p. 71. 7 Buchan's usual pseudonym was 'Albanicus', but he also used a variety of others. Cushing, Initials and Pseudonyms (1886), p. 44 lists Richard Gough as using D. H. in the Gentleman's Magazine . 8 I have not included Hailes's well-known Mirror and World essays in my list. The World essays (1755) are nos. 140, 147, and 204. No. 140 was reprinted in the Scots Magazine , cf. Item 20. In Henry Mackenzie's Mirror (1779-1780) Hailes forwarded papers for the nos. 21, 46, 56, 62, 86, 97, 98. All the contributions were anonymous and Hailes informed Mackenzie, when the latter was preparing a collected edition, that he preferred them to remain so. (Letter 20th May, 1780. N.L.S. MSS, Vol. No. 124.) In N.L.S. MSS, Vol. No. 588, a draft of Essays 97 and 98 has survived, with considerable alteration either by the author or the editors. In the same volume can be found a single sheet which contains a paragraph which belongs to Essay 86, but which was presumably rejected before publication. 9 John Loveday (1742-1809).

Apart from the two drafts mentioned in Items Nos. 10 &amp; 11, no correspondence has, unfortunately, survived. 13 E. g., Memorials and Letters relating to the History of Britain in the Reign of James the First (Glasgow, 1762) &amp; The Secret Correspondence of Sir Robert Cecil with James VI, King of Scotland (London, 1766). 14 Cf.

An example of Hailes's Latin verse is given in Item No. 6. 19 Prof. A. G. Hoover visited Newhailes in 1939, and saw this specimen there. No such document has been filmed for the microfilm collection. 20 In those cases where the magazine article has no title, or a non-descriptive one, I have supplied one. 21 Hailes uses the phrase 'Marian controversy' in his letters as early as 1761. I know of no earlier example of its use to describe the huge literature based on the reputation of Mary, Queen of Scots. 22 One by C. Finlayson, Keeper of the MSS, E.U.L., who very kindly informed me of his find which led to further search. 23 Hailes tried to stimulate other writers to produce lives of eminent Scotsmen in the same format as he had produced his speciments, but with little success. The Earl of Buchan was one of his few supporters. 24 Several of these are preserved in the National Library of Scotland. The verso of each sheet was left blank to allow of manuscript annotation. 25 This letter is quoted by permission of the Yale Boswell Committee and the McGraw-Hill Book Company.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Early Editions and Issues of Scott's Border Antiquities by William B. Todd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Border Antiquities of England and Scotland (1814-1817) comprises two large quarto volumes, lavishly illustrated with 94 plates, and appropriately printed, in part by Thomas Davison of London, in part by James Ballantyne of Edinburgh. 1 Notwithstanding its size, however, the work is very unstable, originally issued in several forms not represented by any of the copies I have seen and, of those observed, now existing in variants differing with every exemplar. This account must therefore be regarded as provisional, sufficient I trust to identify the true first edition in book form and its various impressions, sufficient also to expose a number of reprints or piracies, but hardly adequate to define every possible irregularity. From the beginning the production of this book was determined very much by accident, very little by design, and attended throughout with many uncertainties. The original announcement, appearing in the February 1812 number of the Scots Magazine (p. 132), sets the precedent, never broken thereafter, of promising more than could be fulfilled. "A splendid original work," it reports, "delineating the Border-Antiquities of England and Scotland, is in great forwardness. The first part will be published on the 31st of March, and a part will be continued every three months." After this firm commitment the first part was delayed until June 1 and then, as the Monthly Literary Advertiser affirms, 2 contained only six of the nine plates required. Though all of those originally included are dated May 1812 only five actually belonged to this number, the sixth to a text not published until the fifth part; so four remained to be issued, one dated September (Warkworth Castle) but published with the second number in November, another dated September (Interior of the Castle at Newcastle) but published with the third number in April 1813, a third in May of that year, and the fourth as late as September. The second part, scheduled to appear three months after the first, was eventually published in November 1812 when, as the Advertiser notes, it also included six plates for a text that now, however, required only three. Of the six, though, only one dated September belonged to this part, the four other September plates to the first, third (2), and fifth numbers, and the one dated November also to the third number. Thus the second part was originally encumbered with five superfluous illustrations and lacked two pertaining to its own text, the two finally issued in September 1813 and June 1815. So for every part the text was invariably delayed and the plates invariably mixed, to the utter confusion of the hapless subscribers. Toward the end, as at the beginning, the Scots Magazine has some hopeful news, now that the engraver, John Greig, would complete his work by December 1815; 3 but this too was premature, because four of his plates are dated January and one November 1816. One of the January plates had been promised as early as November 1814, and properly belongs to the ninth number issued in December of that year. 4 Much of this confusion may be laid directly to Greig, who seems to have been something of a vagabond, never about when he was wanted, and often unreported at his last known address. In June 1812 he was living at Chapel Street, Pentonville; in September at 261 High Street, Edinburgh; in November at Broomhills, Great Burstead, Essex; in April 1813 not located; in July variously reported at Great Burstead or Pentonville; in May 1814 again not located; and in December at Upper Street, Islington. 5 Once settled at this last address, however, he did not move again, and thereafter his order of engraving more closely approximated—but never quite matched—the order of printing. Greig, though, was not entirely to blame, for the editors followed no definite plan. To give some distinction to their work they had, by the seventh number, enlisted the aid of Walter Scott—whose name then and thereafter graced every issue—but from first to last they were unable to determine the extent of their edition. In the announcement of the first number it is said that the work would not exceed four volumes, each consisting of eight parts. The first volume, however, contained four parts when issued in July 1813, then nine when issued in December 1814, and finally only six when issued with the second volume in September 1817. By the ninth number the editors were advertising (in a note still represented in the final six-part volume) their intention to limit the work to 16 parts in two volumes; but the second volume eventually comprised parts 7 through 17, and of these, contrary to all announcements early and late, parts 7 to 11 are labeled Vol. I. Despite the haphazard conduct of the engraver and editors, the printers managed their affairs in a most efficient manner. After Ballantyne of Edinburgh had run off the first two numbers (B-I) the work was for some reason transferred to Davison of London, who completed the remaining fifteen (K-3I), the preliminary sheet for the first volume, and a few sheets of an "Introductory Sketch" (b-e in some copies). While the "Sketch" was being printed in London, however, Scott or one of the other Scots "proprietors" sent to Ballantyne a full Introduction (a-q) which interrupted the other effort in mid-sentence and immediately displaced it. Ballantyne then ran off the Appendix ( a-n ) and Davison the preliminary sheet for the second volume and the index ( o-q ). All of this printing, as exhibited by the final issue in book form, was finished in three impressions, each of which may be easily recognized by its size or paper. These impressions are ordered, from one to another, by typographical corrections noted in the bibliographical description and ordered again, within each impression, by the progression of watermarks identified in the accompanying chart.

Unlike the first edition, with its two volumes correctly dated 1814 and 1817, these three, though watermarked as late as 1822, are dated 1814 in both volumes. To meet a continuing demand for India proof illustrations, originally offered only in the Super-Royal impression, one of these later editions reproduces a complete set, now taken, of course, from the plates in their final and somewhat retouched state. Still later Bohn states that "this book was republished under the old date with very inferior impressions of the plates, although some are put forth as India proofs." 16 Here the reference is apparently to a fifth edition, printed on paper dated 1831, but now catalogued, for the only copy observed, under the dates 1813-1815. As this copy is defective, the dates have been taken from the engraved title-pages, both of which, together with all other illustrations, were produced on India paper from re-engraved plates. Since the copy lacks all pages carrying any identification, it is impossible to say whether this edition, issued probably on the occasion of Scott's death in 1832, follows the others in listing Constable as one of the publishers and Ballantyne as one of the printers. Should these names appear in a perfect example, however, the reprint may be dismissed as a piracy, for this particular publisher failed in 1826 and his printer went bankrupt immediately thereafter. Here then is an appropriate terminus ad quem not only for all editions legitimately issued, but for all my attempts to describe them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA Since the impressions of the first edition run in contrary directons—with the super-royal size containing the plates in the earliest but text in the latest state and the medium size with plates in the latest but text in the earliest state—it seems best to list first the largest size, as being the one most desired by collectors.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Though the Ballantyne colophon has been applied to work printed exclusively in London (see T.L.S. , Sept. 7, 1933, p. 592), the use of press figures and certain other indications noted in the Table would appear to certify part of this work as his. In the Antiquities the top figures are 8 and 11; in Rokeby , printed at the same time, and known to be entirely his job, the top figures are 8, 10, and 12. 2 No. 86, June 10, 1812. Assuming in each case that the monthly Advertiser (appearing regularly on the 10th) announces for the Border Antiquities an issue of the 1st (the date cited in the plates), we may reconstruct from one source or the other the following schedule of publication. Dates in brackets have been taken from the plates alone. No. 1 June 1812, #2 Nov., #3 April 1813, #4 July, [#5 Sept., #6 Dec.], #7 May 1814, [#8 Aug.], #9 Dec., [#10 March 1815, #11 May, #12 July, #13 Sept., #14 Nov., #15 Jan. 1816], #16-17 Sept. 1817. 3 LXXVII (Dec. 1815), 935. The welcome event, it will be noticed, failed to appear in the very month in which it was announced. 4 The illustration is of the Monument at Bewcastle (after p. 126), promised in a note in the preliminary sheet for vol. 1, a sheet used both for the 9 part and later 6 part issue. 5 For July 1813 the information is from the Monthly Literary Advertiser and the Gentleman's Magazine ; for other dates, from the Advertiser alone. 6 Ballantyne's work is figured (see description), bears his colophon at χ 1r , and is generally of 13.4+ cm. type-measure. 7 Davison's work is unfigured, bears his colophon at i 1v (both vols.) and q 4 v , and is generally of 13.2— cm. type-measure. 8 These four sheets, comprising the first number, reset without figures in Berg copy on the unwatermarked paper used toward the end of the work. 9 Berg copy sheets P-Q watermarked Whatman 1811. 10 This preliminary used, apparently, both for the nine-part (B-2L) and later six-part (B-2B) issues of the 1st vol. 11 Suppressed "Introductory Sketch". 12 Date conjectured. The earlier "Sketch" does not appear in any copy of this impression which I have seen. 13 Full Introduction, displacing the "Sketch". 14 Appendix. 15 Index. 16 This comment, which does not appear in the original 1834 Lowndes edition of the Bibliographer's Manual , may be found in Bohn's 1863 revision, VIII, p. 2227. 17 This, illustrating the interior of Newark Castle (facing p. 66), is on thinner paper inlaid in the cartonnage.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Coxe's A Description of Carolana (1722-1741) by Robert K. Turner, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By 1698 Dr. Daniel Coxe, a London physician who speculated in colonial rights, had secured the assignment of the patent to the proprietorship of the province of Carolana, a territory which extended from central Virginia southward through Florida, and westward to the Mississippi valley. Forthwith he began to seek confirmation of the patent, but without waiting for his rights to be secured fully he caused an expedition to be fitted out and to set sail for the New World to establish an English settlement on the Mississippi. Unfortunately for his plans the French were already there; the English ships were met on the Mississippi by a party under the command of Bienville and the attempt to settle proved abortive. Several years later Coxe tried to establish a colony in Virginia, this time with a group of French Huguenots, but the second attempt also met with failure. Dr. Coxe's own travels in America were confined to the vicarious experience of reading in his large collection of explorers' accounts, but his son, also named Daniel, chose to seek his fortune in the New World. The younger Coxe landed in New Jersey in 1702. Being a favorite of Lord Cornbury, he received from his patron the rank of colonel and the command of the English forces in the western part of the colony. He married a wealthy Quaker's daughter and was becoming prominent in local politics when he ran afoul of the incumbent colonial administration and had to retreat hastily to England in 1716. In 1722 he published in London A Description of the English Province of Carolana , a book which has proved to be of interest to historians and collectors because it contains an early printed proposal for a confederated colonial government. This volume is an octavo, collating [A1] i B 8 c-d 8 e 2 B-H 8 I4 K1 ( i B3 missigned B5). It is divided into three sections: a preface ( i B1 r —e1 v ), which contains an account of the repulse of the elder Coxe's expeditions and a discussion of the consequences of the French having established a settlement; 1 the text (B1 r —H6 v ), which draws upon Dr. Coxe's library of Americana to present an attractive picture of the province for prospective emigrants; and an appendix (H7 r —K1 v ), which advances a claim for the validity of the Coxe patent. It was reissued in 1726, 1727, and, as part of a collection of three works on America made by Coxe, in 1741. More recently the book, in whole or in part, has appeared three times. 2 A description of the work has been given in several places, sometimes inaccurately and never completely. Sabin's note that issues subsequent to that of 1722 are "the same work with new title-pages" 3 is reasonably accurate, but apparently the issue of 1726 was unknown to him. Ignoring Sabin's entries, the Church catalogue draws a conclusion which seems to be quite the opposite of the real state of affairs when it notes of the 1722 issue, "This work must have had considerable success, as it was reprinted in 1726, 1727, and again, with additions, in 1741." 4 The question of whether or not the appearances of the book after 1722 were in the form of reprints is easily resolved. An examination of the typographical peculiarities and watermarks of later issues shows without a doubt that everything, excepting the title-leaves, is of the 1722 printing. It seems, therefore, that instead of enjoying "considerable success" the edition did not sell out for at least nineteen years in spite of stationers' periodic attempts to foist off on the public the original sheets disguised as new editions. 5 The fact that the sheets changed hands three times 6 might be a further indication of the slowness of sale. The printing of the book seems to have been normal enough. The facts are these: in eleven copies examined the letterpress is identical except for the title-leaves which are in all cases, excepting that of the 1722 (first) issue, cancels. 7 An engraved map (47 x 58 cm.) is bound with each copy, usually, but not always, between e2 and B1 or before the title-page, and because of this variation in binding, stubs are found in different places in different copies. Instead of appearing on four leaves as one expects in octavo folds, the watermark 8 of each sheet seems invariably to fall on only two leaves, a fact that leads one to suspect either that the watermark was not exactly in the center of the half sheet or that the printing was not centered on the sheet. Except for this peculiarity the watermarks fall normally for octavo full sheet printing except in gatherings e, I, and K. In these gatherings the watermarks appear either in gathering I on the one hand or in gatherings e and K on the other, leading one to suspect quite strongly that what the collational formula suggests about the printing of the book is true — that the four leaves of I, the two of e, the one of K, and the original title-leaf 9 were printed as one full sheet. This suspicion is made stronger by the fact that in one copy (ViU 291418) two stubs are found between the conjugate leaves I2 and I3. The excision of the leaves has not been made smoothly; the stubs are irregularly cut as if they had been removed with a small scissors after binding. These stubs must be the remainder of two leaves sewn in by mistake and inexpertly removed later. In order to determine the imposition of the type from which the leaves of e, I, K, and the original title-page were printed, one may look first at the positions of watermarks in other gatherings. Ordinarily the watermark of each sheet appears either on leaves 6 and 7 or 5 and 8, a fact which indicates that the sheets were impressed in such a way that the watermarks normally fell on the longer axis of the forme closer to the center than to the outside edge. 10 Watermarks in e, I, and K appeared in eleven copies examined a total of ten times, according to the following distribution: e1 (1), K1 and e2 (5), I3 and I4 (2), I1 and I2 (2). It is apparent that K1 must have occupied a position in the forme head to head with e2, I3 with I4, and I1 with I2. The proportionately greater number of occurrences of the watermark on K1 and e2 suggests that the type pages from which they were printed probably occupied two of the next-to-center positions in the octavo forme. Inspection of the copies also revealed that I1 and I4 as well as I2 and I3 are conjugate leaves; therefore, one pair must also have occupied a next-to-center position in the forme and the other an outside position. It will be remembered, however, that two stubs were found between I2 and I3. If the imposition were made in such a way as to allow two leaves to fold between I2 and I3, then the four leaves of I must have been imposed as 2, 3, 6, and 7 of an octavo full sheet. 11 The other half of the forme contained K1 and e2 in the 8 and 5 positions and the original title-page and e1 in the 1 and 4 positions, the location in the forme of the two leaves of e being determined by the fact that they are conjugate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The table of contents appears on e2 r and e2 v . 2 A second edition was printed in St. Louis in 1840 by Churchill and Harris. The text alone was reprinted by B. F. French in Historical Collections of Louisiana . . . Part II (Philadelphia, 1850). In 1940 a mimeographed reprint was made under the auspices of the W.P.A. by the Sutro Branch of the California State Library (Occasional Papers No. 11). 3 A Dictionary of Books Relating to America (1873), V, 46. 4 G. W. Cole, A Catalogue of Books Relating to the Discovery and Early History of North and South America (1907), No. 886. Before Sabin and Cole, Henry Stevens in Historical Nuggets (1862), pp. 199-201, had listed the issues of 1722, 1727, and 1741, but had been under the impression that they were three different editions which were "the same, except for title-pages." Winsor's History of America (1873), V, 69, n. 1, states that the 1722 issue "was reprinted in 1726, again in 1727, and with a lengthened title, in 1741." 5 The title-page of the 1726 issue identifies it as "The Second Edition." 6 The 1722 issue was printed, according to the title-page, for B. Cowse (Course), the 1726 for A. Bettesworth, the 1727 for Edward Symon, and the 1741 for Oliver Payne. 7 Two title-pages of the 1727 issue have been observed, which, for convenience, are designated A and B. Typographically they are nearly identical in appearance, although a close comparison of the letterpress and the spacing reveals that they are products of different settings. They may be most readily distinguished by the following characteristics: A. 1. The "s" in the word " Esq. ", five lines from the bottom of the page is nicely rounded and the type definitely has been kerned. 2. A line drawn diagonally across the page from the right vertex of the "N" in "DESCRIPTION" (second line) to the head serif of the "P" in "Printed" (penultimate line) will just nick the last "E" in "MESCHACEBE" (about the middle of the page). B. 1. The "s" seems to have been damaged — the descender bends up sharply. It appears that the type was not kerned. 2. The line will pass through the "o" in "or" in the same line as "MESCHACEBE". It should be noted that both title-pages are set to the same measure (84 mm.). It is likely that they were set at the same time in the same shop for convenience in machining — that the printing was done "two up." A summary of the number of title-pages examined is: 1722 (6), 1726 (5), 1727A (3), 1727B (5), 1741 (11). The writer was able to see only eleven of these; the other nineteen were compared by the librarians of collections with photostats of the ViU title-pages (1722, 1727A, 1727B, and 1741) and CtY (1726). 8 Heawood, No. 1074. 9 Only two 1722 copies (ViU and DLC) were examined by the writer and in neither case was a watermark found on the title-leaf. It should be noted that although both of these title-pages were produced from the same setting of type, the ViU is on paper so much lighter in weight than the paper used in the rest of the book that one is tempted to think it a cancel. The title-leaf of the DLC, however, is normal enough, leading to the conclusion that the ViU is an aberrant copy. 10 In seven copies 85 watermarks were found in leaves other than those in e, I, and K. Of this number six appeared on leaves 2 and 3, seven on 1 and 4, 35 on 6 and 7, and 37 on 5 and 8. 11 The positions of I2 and I3 are fixed as octavo positions 3 and 6 by the presence of the stubs. It may be argued that I2 and I3 were in positions 2 and 7 and I1 and I4 in positions 1 and 8 and that there could have been four leaves in the center of the fold instead of two as the presence of the stubs indicates. This argument is precluded if K and e occupy head-to-head positions in the forme. In gathering I of ViU 291418 it was observed that the chain lines of the paper appeared depressed on I1 r , I2 v , I3 r , and I4 v and raised on I1 v , I2 r , I3 v , and I4 r . If I1 and I4 had been imposed in the octavo 1 and 8 positions and if the sheet had been fed into the press with the same side up, depressions would have been seen on I1 v , I2 v , I3 r , and I4 r .</field>
      <field name="heading_text">British Authorship of Ballads in the Isaiah Thomas Collection by Thomas L. Philbrick</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1924 Worthington C. Ford published his valuable catalog of ballads in the Isaiah Thomas collection of the American Antiquarian Society. In his introduction Ford gives the impression that most of the verses, with the exception of the British traditional ballads and a few such familiar products of English song writers as Carey's "Sally in Our Alley" and Dibdin's "Tom Bowlin's Epitaph," are of American manufacture. According to Ford, these verses bear witness to the charge that in 1814 "our poets were still in the lisping stage and in simplicity of structure and liberty of rhyme, united with a shameless display of the sentimental, could hardly have been poorer." 1 Ford asserts that the ballads in the Thomas Collection are largely the work of hopelessly anonymous hack writers; indeed, "the authorship of most of these verses can never be so much as conjectured" (p. 18). On the contrary, the following list of British authors of verses in the collection indicates that the songs of the sentimental and comic varieties are almost entirely of English origin. Moreover, the authors of these ballads are not lost in obscurity; they are among the most celebrated dramatists and poets of their day. The list could, without doubt, be extended by further investigation, yet it includes, I hope, a sufficiently high proportion of those ballads for which British authorship can be determined to be significant and useful. Items are arranged in the following order: Ford's catalog number, first line, author, and source for my assignment of authorship.

      <field name="heading_text">The Manuscript of Page's "Marse Chan" by John R. Roberson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thomas Nelson Page's volume of short stories, In Ole Virginia , was first published in 1887. Page's autograph drafts of the six stories which constitute the book are contained in the collection of literary manuscripts given to the Alderman Library by Clifton Waller Barrett. I have collated the first and most famous of them, "Marse Chan," as it appears in the manuscript, in The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine for April, 1884, 1 in the 1887 edition of In Ole Virginia , and in the Plantation Edition of Page's collected works (1906). The collation reveals that the editors of the Century made considerable revisions before the first publication, and that almost without exception Page let their changes stand when he brought out the story in book form. The manuscript is written in ink for the most part, on lined note-paper, on one side only. It is quite legible, and is obviously a fair copy, a second or perhaps a third draft. Rosewell Page, in his memoir of his brother, says that "the manuscript from which 'Marse Chan' was published" was in the hand of a boyhood friend of Page's, a grandson of his neighbors the Winstons. 2 This, then, is not the manuscript which was submitted to the magazine, but I believe it is its immediate predecessor in the line of descent. At some time Page gathered together a draft of each of the six stories and had them bound in heavy brown paper. He wrote notes on some of them giving the circumstances of their composition. The one for "Marse Chan," dated March 24, 1913, reads as follows: Note— This story was written in my law office, in Shafer's Building, on 10th St. in Richmond, Virginia in the late summer of 1880, and occupied me about a week. It was then sent with a poem, "The Bent Monk" to the Editor of Scribner's Mag. with a request that I be commissioned to write a paper on Yorktown, for the approaching Yorktown Celebration. I heard nothing of it until the following Feb. 7, when I rec'd. a letter from Mr. R. W. Gilder, Ed. of the Century Mag. , accepting the story, returning the poem, and commissioning me to write the paper on Yorktown. He sent me a cheque for $80.00 for the story, which made me feel rich—richer than, when years afterwards, he paid me $1000 for a story. It was not published till April 1884. Thos. Nelson Page Wash'n D.C. March 24, 1913 Page had a tendency, in his early days at least, to diffuseness. The greater part of the changes the editors of the Century made in the story were intended simply to shorten it. In the letter accepting "Marse Chan," they wrote that they would like to omit some parts near the beginning which they felt were "extraneous to the subject of the story. . . the relations of the young couple." 3 Later Mrs. Sophia Bledsoe Herrick, of the Century staff wrote to Page, on August 29, 1885: 4 "In Marse Chan the material was in excellent shape, it was a charming story. Where it had to be shortened I cut it with positive pain—it was so exquisite from beginning to end." But cut it she did. Two incidents included in the manuscript were cut out entirely. One concerns the childhood of Marse Chan and Miss Anne, when a boy in their school dropped a slate pencil down Anne's dress, and Chan, to avenge her, put two hornets down the boy's back. Sam, the Negro narrator, says that Chan was whipped, but that he never told "huccome" he did it. Page noted in the margin of the manuscript, "This incident was cut out to shorten the story-T.N.P." The other omission concerns a time when a neighbor whipped Sam, and Chan sought out the man and thrashed him. Page noted, "This incident was cut out and was used in Edinburg's Drowndin. T.N.P." In addition, a good bit of introductory and descriptive material was pruned from the beginning of the story. Of these cuts, the only one that seems worth recording is from the very beginning of the manuscript. In Page's hand it reads: One afternoon, in the autumn of 187-, I was riding along the sandy road that follows the "ridge" between two of the smaller rivers of eastern Virginia when I made a chance acquaintance with an "ole fam'ly nigger," as he proudly styled himself, who illustrated well the close union of the comical and the pathetic which is so striking a characteristic of his race. His narrative, which I have endeavored to reproduce in his own language in the following pages, exemplified strikingly the loving fidelity to his old master so astonishing to the outside world and so touching to those who alone know and appreciate the negro at his true worth. All of this passage after "eastern Virginia" was omitted. There are a number of minor changes. Apparently the editors felt that Page's reproduction of the Negro dialect, no matter how faithful, would be unintelligible to northern readers if the pronunciations were too foreign to those to which they were accustomed, or the spellings too removed from conventional orthography. Consequently they modified a number of them. The very title of the story was changed from "Mahs Chan" to "Marse Chan," a spelling which Page himself used afterwards. "Cyahn" became "Kyarnt," "Whahn yo come on dawg?" became "Whyn't you come on, dawg?" and "geahden" became "garden." (Page himself used the palatalized "a" of Tidewater all his life, according to his brother.) There were occasional changes in matters of style, in which Page's version may well be preferred more often than the "improvements." He said Chan's dog was corpulent from "over-much feeding and over-little-exercise." The editors made this simply "excessive feeding." Page called him "his canine-ship"; they called him "his dogship." These changes seem to be motivated by opposing inclinations toward the refined and the familiar. In each case, Page's ear seems better. Page wrote, correctly, of a "bran new saddle," but the magazine printed "bran' new." The editors seemed determined to leave out anything which might offend a reader in connection with religion, strong drink, or horror. Moreover, Page had Sam somewhat moralistic, and these passages were cut. Also cut were these lines: "Den Cun'l Chamb'lin he sort o' got to takin a leetle too much— yo' know any gentleman wil do dat occasionally." (This said with a slight glance at me as if he wouldn't admit to a stranger that one of the people he had known would act badly in any way.) "He [Marse Chan] was stone dead. Dey had done kill im twice, fuh deah wuz a bay'net stobbed wight in im besides de bullet in he breas." There are two evidences of revision by Page himself. In the earliest version, Anne wrote to Chan that she had decided she loved him, without any particular reason being given for her change of heart just then. Apparently Page decided that her motivation was weak, and added the incident of Chan's quarreling with Mister Ronny when he started to say something about Anne, and Sam's writing Judy about it. The addition is clearly marked, since it is in pencil on the versos of the leaves immediately preceding the arrival of Anne's letter. It is also marked, in an ink different from the rest of the manuscript, " L. A. ," which could mean Later Addition. Sam's reminiscence about how well off the slaves were does not appear in the manuscript, so it was apparently added later too. It reads in the printed version: Niggers didn' hed nothin' 'tall to do — jes hed to 'ten' to de feedin' an' cleanin' de hosses, an' doin' what de marster tell 'em to do; an' when dey wuz sick, dey had things sont 'em out de house, an' de same doctor come to see 'em whar 'ten' to de white folks when dey wuz po'ly. Dyar warn' no trouble nor nothin'. In 1887 the firm of Charles Scribner's Sons brought out In Ole Virginia, or Marse Chan and Other Stories . The text is substantially the same as that which appeared in the Century ; none of the omissions have been restored. The main changes concern the spelling of the Negro dialect. As has been remarked, the Century did not follow Page's spellings when they seemed likely to be unintelligible. Apparently Page went through the magazine version and corrected words he thought too untrue to Negro speech, and Scribner's used this marked Century as printer's copy. The word most often changed is "other," with its compounds. The Century spelled it ordinarily in "Marse Chan" as "udder"; the book spelled it "urr." So, also, "anudder" became "anurr"; and "nudder," in the phrase "some one or nudder" became "nurr." ("Nurr" can also mean "neither," as in "He wouldn' let none o' de chil'en tease her, nurr.") A variation occurs with the rendering of "the other," which the Century makes "tudder" or once "tor'er," but the book makes "t'urr." The similar sound, "brother," was changed from "brudder" to "brurr." "Together" was changed from "togedder" to "togerr." Other spelling changes are "three" to "th'ee," "gwi" to "gwine," "whop" to "whup," "God" and "Gawd" to "Gord," "'coz" to "'cause," "flag" to "fleg," "ke'idge" to ker'idge" and "hyard" to "heahd." Two spelling changes seem to make no difference in pronunciation; perhaps they are accounted for by the fact that the Century forms have other meanings: "sense" became "sence," and "staid" became "stayed." In another case the changes seem to have been made to render more natural Sam's quotations of the words of white speakers. In the Century Anne says, ". . . you made me a present of my father, whom you first insulted an' then prevented from gittin' satisfaction." In the book she says "fust insulted." A few lines later, the book changes Chan's "by yourself" to "by yourse'f." As far as punctuation is concerned, the only significant change is in Page's use of the dash. He regularly placed a comma before a dash, and the Century followed his practice. In the book these commas were removed. In 1906, Scribner's began publishing the Plantation Edition of Page's works. Collation shows only five variations from the 1887 text. A missing apostrophe was added to "im" in one place. The form "'t wuz" was run together to the more usual "'twuz." "For'ds" was expanded to the more intelligible "for'ads," and "ra'ed" (for "rared") was changed to "ra'd" to preserve the broad "a" sound. "Solum" was changed to "solumn," to make the meaning clear. Consideration of the manuscript and three printed versions of "Marse Chan" lends support to two accepted facts about Page the artist. Magazine editors did him a great service in disciplining his creations. Page himself gave rather careful attention to the details of his transcription of the speech of the old Virginia Negro. Both facts contributed to make him one of the most successful dialect story writers of his day.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Collation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise by Matthew J. Bruccoli *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Much has been said about F. Scott Fitzgerald's illiteracy, and This Side of Paradise has been singled out for notice as the worst offender. Fitzgerald's inattentive years at Princeton and his vagarious reading produced an only partially educated young writer. Though he came to perfect his ear for English, throughout his career he remained a wretched speller. This Side of Paradise , his first novel, published in 1920, was peppered with errors. These did not pass unnoticed, and they were commented upon by the press. Edmund Wilson wrote: "It is not only full of bogus ideas and faked literary references but it is full of English words misused with the most reckless abandon." 1 In his column, "The Conning Tower," Franklin P. Adams reprimanded Fitzgerald for "sloppy carelessness" and proceeded to list twenty-eight errors in the book. 2 How bad is the original printed text? What types of errors was Fitzgerald prone to make at this stage in his career? And how conscious was Scribner's of the faults in the book? To ascertain the answers to these problems, the Hinman Collating Machine at the University of Virginia has been employed to compare the first printing of This Side of Paradise (Scribner's, April 1920) with a 1954 Scribner's reprint made from the same plates. This collation revealed thirty-one changes which fall into six categories: corrections of misspelled references to books and authors (10); corrections of misspellings of names and places (5); other corrections of errors in spelling and usage (6); corrections of errors involving careless proof-reading (3); corrections of miscellaneous errors (3); and revisions of non-errors (4). The category of 'corrections of errors involving careless proof-reading' refers to such items as: "I restless", where the missing verb should have been supplied before the novel went to press; and the category of 'revisions of non-errors' refers to such changes as: "tickle-toe on the soft carpet" to "shimmy enthusiastically", where the revision was dictated by stylistic concerns. Altogether there are nineteen spelling errors, and some of them are truly surprising. For example, the dedication in the first printing is "To Sigorney Fay", which was corrected to "To Sigourney Fay"; and three times the Nassau Literary Magazine (for which Fitzgerald wrote as an undergraduate) is incorrectly abbreviated as the Litt . In the first printing Asheville, N. C., appears twice on page seven as Ashville , but only one of these errors is subsequently corrected. Arnold Bennet is corrected to Bennett on one page but is left uncorrected on another page. 3 One of the misspelled author's names is first given as Samuel Johnston ; however, since this occurs in a humorous letter, it was probably purposely misspelled and subsequently corrected because readers missed the point—elsewhere in the novel the Great Cham's name is spelled correctly. 4 After the collation on the Hinman Machine, the list of revisions was checked against the first twelve impressions of This Side of Paradise . 5 This revealed that revisions were made only in the fourth impression of May 1920 and the seventh impression of August 1920. One of these corrections introduced a new error into the book: Mary Roberts Rhinehart is correctly changed to Rinehart in the fourth impression, but this is incorrectly changed to Rineheart in the seventh impression; elsewhere in the novel the name is spelled correctly throughout all impressions. 6 At least some of the alterations in the fourth impression appear to have been made by direction of the author, but those in the seventh are indifferent and may have resulted from the publisher's review proofreading. The search for impressions turned up a special state of the third impression, specially bound for presentation at a meeting of the American Booksellers Association in May 1920. Tipped in before the title-page is a leaf bearing a photograph of the author and "The Author's Apology" (reprinted below). The evidence gathered in this collation of This Side of Paradise establishes that the first printing was an inexcusably sloppy job, and that the blame must be distributed between author and publisher. Furthermore, the correction of this foul text was itself a slap-dash project, for the 1954 reprint still contains errors—including those listed by Adams and Wilson, although in some cases the required corrections are as simple as changing single letters, as in the word Juvenalia . 7 (The numbers in parentheses indicate the impression in which the alteration first appeared.)

In fact, to write it took three months; to conceive it—three minutes; to collect the data in it—all my life. The idea of writing it came on the first of last July: it was a substitute form of dissipation. My whole theory of writing I can sum up in one sentence: An author ought to write for the youth of his own generation, the critics of the next, and the schoolmasters of ever afterward.
