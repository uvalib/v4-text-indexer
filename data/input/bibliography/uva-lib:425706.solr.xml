      <field name="heading_text">FOREWORD</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It seems hard to believe that twenty years have gone by since a group of dedicated individuals banded together to form the the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia. It is equally hard to believe, though we have tangible and most impressive evidence to attest it, that this is the twentieth volume of Studies in Bibliography . It is not unusual to be misled by the passage of time, but in this case the illusion has been fostered by the fact that Studies sprang into being full-grown and fully armed, like Minerva from the head of Jupiter, whose thunderbolts she wielded from time to time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The telescoping of time is further assisted by a remarkable record of service on the part of the Society's officers. Mr. Linton Massey has been the Society's long-time President, Mr. John Cook Wyllie its indefatigable Secretary/Treasurer and of course Professor Fredson Bowers has been its Editor, albeit for the last three or four volumes even he has allowed himself an Associate, Dr. L. A. Beaurline. Persistence is a not unfamiliar characteristic of officials of bibliographical societies — A. W. Pollard set the pace with his forty years' editorship of The Library and his forty-one years as Secretary of the Bibliographical Society — but the University of Virginia has in this record of service excelled all its brethren. I am sure however that the members of the University of Virginia Bibliographical Society would agree that the Society with the prestige it now enjoys and the great success it has had is substantially the image of its Editor, whose industry and monumental achievements in analytical bibliography are the admiration of bibliographers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am not a colleague of Mr. Puff, nor am I "a practioner in panegyric," but I am sure I am right in offering congratulations to the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, and in acclaiming it on behalf of its brother society in London, and of those in New York, Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dublin, which are celebrated twice yearly by the Colophon Club of London as "The Other Bibliographical Societies," as a thriving, vigorous body, devoted to the pursuit of scholarly objectives, as a significant publisher in the field of bibliography, as the inspirer of young book-collectors and as the crusader for the highest standards in printing and book-production.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That I, as immediate Past President of the Bibliographical Society, should have been asked to introduce this twentieth volume is a compliment which I appreciate deeply and acknowledge most warmly on behalf of the Society and of myself as its spokesman. Professor Bowers surely drew much of his inspiration from the work of our Society and the pages of The Library contain some of his earliest work in bibliography. I like to think that the rigidly uncompromising standards which he has applied so successfully are in part at least the fruits of his association with our members.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sir Frank Francis, K.C.B. Director and Principal Librarian of the British Museum</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, like the venerable Royal Society of London, came into being because divers worthy and inquisitive persons met to form an invisible college. This issue of Studies in Bibliography commemorates the twentieth anniversary of that notable conjunction. To members of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia in the old world and Asia (of whom there are hundreds), a 20th birthday will seem the mark of youth, and to members in the new world (of whom there are hundreds) it is also a mark of accomplishment and stability.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am pleased, therefore, as President of the University which cherishes the Society, to salute a notable institution upon its attainment of an age that symbolizes both vitality and maturity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The renown of Studies in Bibliography , and of the senior editor who has fulfilled that responsibility from the initial volume, requires no elaboration or other encomium. As a consequence, I take this occasion to allude to the invisibility of the supporting structure of a society which in twenty years has published not only twenty volumes of annual Studies but also more than twice that number of separate bibliographical monographs. Although some of the moving spirits of this invisible college, with their modest inclination for anonymity, conceal their good offices, it is appropriate on an anniversary to applaud the officers and council whose names appear on both the earliest and on the current rosters of managers: Fredson Bowers, Joseph Carrière, Chalmers Gemmill, Atcheson Hench, Linton Massey, Eleanor Shea, Arthur Stocker, and John Wyllie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This list includes bibliographers, literary critics, patrons of the arts, a physician, a philologist, and a classical scholar. It is a pleasure also to recognize three successive librarians of the University of Virginia — Harry Clemons, Jack Dalton, and John Wyllie — and to commend them for the impetus which they have given to this learned enterprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To these, and to all of my fellow members of the Bibliographical Society, I send cordial greetings, with congratulations upon a past that bespeaks an illustrious future.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Greatest English Lyric? — A New Reading of Joe E. Skilmer's "Therese" by John Frederick Nims</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Genuine revolutions in literary taste and theory occur on an average only once every seven generations; therefore it is a source of satisfaction to have myself piloted what may be the most shattering reappraisal in our literature. I am referring — as the world of letters now knows well — to the discovery (made about the time that flying saucers began to be widely observed here and abroad) of that core of inner is -ness in the poetry of the long misread, long underrated Joburt Eggson Skilmer, or Joe E. Skilmer as he himself signed his poems. Slighted by serious readers for what seemed the facility of his technique and the pious banality of his thought — especially as shown in the poem known as "Trees" — Skilmer was in reality the perpetrator of an existentialist hoax on a public that prided itself on knowing what was genuine. For years, many of us had been dissatisfied with the reading generally accorded this remarkable poem — the kind of official reading that provoked academic guffaws in a thousand classrooms. "There is more here than meets thee, eye," I would murmur to myself, teased by a host of ambiguities, of velleities that never quite came clear. It was a question of tone. Perhaps my first breakthrough came when I heard Professor Wrugson O. Muttson reading a line from Pound's "The River-Merchant's Wife: A Letter": A fourteen I married my Lord you. Muttson read the line as if it expressed wifely devotion. But it was obvious to me, as to any especially sensitive reader, that Pound intended the line to be heavily ironic, and that the "tone" might better be represented by something like At fourteen I married (my Lord!) you ? My trouble had been that I was ventriloquizing, putting my own voice into the poem, instead of letting it read itself to me . Do not read poems — this became my principle — be read to by them. This approach led to a number of discoveries, of which possibly the most earth-shaking was my article proving that Hamlet's famous soliloquy is not about suicide at all but about his meteorological and alchemical experiments with a numbers of test tubes (the "retorts" he is famous for), of which the tube lettered "E" seemed the most promising if the most vexatious: Tube "E" or not tube "E" — that is the quest, chum. Weather? 'Tis no blur in the mind . . . But this reading, now officially adopted in the best textual editions, is too well known to need further quotation. I have also found my method of "deep reading" fruitful in the perusal of several thousand lines of Paradise Lost , and I suspect that our whole literature will have to be reread in the light of it. However: it was on the basis of this strict principle that I returned to Skilmer's great love poem to Therese Murk of Peoria. Called simply "Therese", or "T'rese", it had too long been thought of as having something to do with "trees" ! The misconception arose from Skilmer's supreme irony; he had all too successfully "achieved an overlay", as he liked to say when speaking of the technique of poetry. That is, by a triumph of art he had given a shallow surface glaze, a pretty spindrift, to the profound abysses of the poem — a glaze so trompe-l'oeil that many were never able to see beneath it. What the public had been doing was reading only the "overlay" instead of what he called the "substruct", and what they settled for was something miserably like this: I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree. A tree whose hungry mouth is pressed &#134;Upon&#134; the earth's sweet flowing breast. Upon whose bosom snow has lain, &#134;And&#134; intimately lives with rain. A tree that looks &#134;at&#134; God all day, And lifts her leafy arms to pray. A tree that may in summer wear A nest of robins in her hair. Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree. Sheer banality! (And how far short of Skilmer's own noble definition of a poem as "a shimmering spitball flung into the great catcher's-mitt of eternity.") But the poem's inner ness, which my researches have arrived at, is another thing entirely. What I mean to do here is demonstrate the "substruct", unit by unit, explicating where I can, though it is doubtful that any reader, or group of readers, will ever arrive at an adequate notion of the riches hidden in this most wonderful of poems.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. I think? That I shall never, see! Up, owe 'em love. Leah's a tree. Probably not since John Donne's "For Godsake hold your tongue, and let me love" has a poem opened with such explosive élan. " I think?" he rages; and in that fury is a ringing refusal to see life merely in terms of the "cogitations" that have amazed lesser poets. Here the whole Eliotic tradition of intellectualized verse is swept cleanly away forever — an achievement the more remarkable inasmuch as that tradition had not yet come into being. But few poets have had antennae so sensitive, been so unfailing a Tiresias (Therese? Ah yes!) in divining the yet-to-come. Crass indeed is the reader who fails to sense, in the proemial words, the poet's curling lip, 1 or who fails to note the hoot of scorn in the derisive "see" that concludes the line with a vulgarity ah how voulu ! Almost blatant, this effect; and yet, beneath the brassy fanfare, what delicate counterpoint of grammatical woodwinds in the antiphony of declarative mood to interrogative, an antiphony that becomes harangue when we feel it in terms of the inner dialogue, the colloquy of a soul tormented by an age when all values have turned moot. Yet, as always in Skilmer, violence tempered with amenity: instead of the scowling "will" of resolution, only the disclaiming modesty of that simple "shall". The second line, opening with courage and defiance, can but deepen the stated theme. "Up!" (cf. the Italian "Su! coraggio!") as the poet, confronting the inenarrable chaos of his world, lifts himself from that slough of despond by the Muses' very bootstrap. Don't give love away, he exhorts himself; don't wanton away so rare a substance on the all and sundry. Owe them love; do not pay when payment is despised. How much terser these moving words than such romantic maundering as When I was one-and-twenty I heard a wise man say, "Give crowns and pounds and guineas But not your heart away. . ." But — oh marvel of art — again the tight-lipped acerbity is softened by one of the loveliest transitions in all poetry. After the corrosive cynicism of the opening, the gentle evocation of Biblical womanhood fuses, as in Dante, with the mythology of the ancient world, in a line that sums up the fugacity of all things mortal. "Leah's a tree" indeed; Leah has become a tree, has escaped from the aggressor's pursuit, from the weary wheel of being. When Skilmer says "Leah" he is of course thinking of Daphne — the names have three letters (if no more) in common; our poet works by preference in that hallowed three , perhaps more meaningfully here than elsewhere, since in his sturdy American dialect Therese and threes would have been pronounced alike. It is no accident that the number of lines in the poem (12) is easily divisible by three, with none left over. Characteristic too of Skilmer's esemplastic knack is this grafting of image onto image; it is wholly natural that in thinking of the Ovidian Daphne he should conceive of her a lo divino — see her not as some mincing pagan, but aureate in the scriptural halo that Dante too looped like lassoes of tinsel round her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. A tree — who's hung? Greymouth is pressed Upon the earth-Swede, Flo Ingbrest. A tree is indeed a tree, embodies as nothing else the very essence of the arboreal. An image of the world's green beauty — but no less an emblem of its horror. Skilmer's panoramic imagination sees the tree as a death-image, a very gallows with its dismal fruit. Painstaking Dantists ("In our age," the poet dourly quipped, "there are no painless Dantists") may well see here the influence of Dante's Wood of the Suicides. We have learned little about Flo Ingbrest — Florence C. Ingbrest of 1222 Stitt St., Des Moines. Her very address is known only because it was found tattooed on the left hip of a sailor washed ashore at Tampa after the great hurricance of '23. It is clear that Miss Ingbrest meant much to the poet, who saw in this simple Swedish girl a power participating so fully in the chthonic matriarchal atavism of the dark earth itself that he calls her simply his "earth-Swede". Her earthy affections, however, were soon alienated by the vague and sinister figure the poet calls Greymouth, a misty shape ominous as any of the ghosts that slink nameless through the early Eliot. Though much research has been done on the unknown Greymouth, little has been ascertained. Dr. Woggs Clurth, basing his argument soundly on the morpheme "rey" in Greymouth, has proposed that he was really Watson King of Canton, the affable rapist; Dr. Phemister Slurk, dispensing with what he derides as "evidence", has suggested that he represents Warren G. Harding, an Ohio politico of the '20's. Cavillings all: Greymouth, whosoever he may have "been" in the world we think of as real, now, through Skilmer's artistry, exists forever in the purlieus of the Muse — slinking, loose-lipped, drivelling, livid with his nameless vice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3. Upon whose boozin's (no!) has lain Anne D'Intagh Mittley — lives wi' Thrane. In the third stanza, sometimes insensitively printed as the fifth, the tragedy grows blacker yet. After Florence C. Ingbrest and a handful of casual flames, the poet sought solace with the Mittley sisters of Boston. Researchers have shown that there were two: Daisy (or "Diz") Mittley, and her much younger sister Anne D'Intagh. It was the younger the poet loved, but again the romance was blighted by a conniving interloper, this time the wealthy Thaddeus Thrane of Glasgow, whose nationality is slyly derided in the dialectal "wi'" for "with". The butt of frequent barbs in the Skilmer corpus, he is here dismissed with a contemptuous phrase. Though his beloved Anne lived "wi'" Thrane at the time the poem was written, Skilmer seems less troubled by this passing infidelity than by her amour with Greymouth — for Greymouth is the true antecedent of "whose". We now learn that he was a heavy drinker — and immediately the mysterious soubriquet is clear. Extensive research has established that gris is the common French word for grey . But gris also means drunk . Greymouth then is unmasked as Drunk Mouth. Indeed, so great a guzzler was Greymouth that the loyal Miss Mittley was said, by a witty metonomy (or synecdoche) 2 to have lain not on his bosom but (with a pun that anticipates Joyce by several weeks) on his "boozin's". One almost hesitates to mention that "bosoms" too has its questionable advocates. 3 Be that as it may, one wonders if in all literature the tragedy of four lives has been so harrowingly adumbrated? All one can conjure up for comparison is Dante's Siena me fè; disfecemi Maremma. But Dante, with his five and a half words for one life, is long-winded compared with Skilmer, who averages a mere three words per head, or even less, if one counts the "wi'" as fractional diction. In this grisly aperçu, so true of all humanity, the resources of typography too are put to unexampled use, with the two-letter "no" followed by an exclamation mark that is like a spine straight with moral indignation, and enclosed in the semicircularity of parentheses, like lips rounded in incredulous refusal. But the "no" is uncompromisingly jostled by the assertive has , with its harsh aspirate, distorted from honest Roman type into italics, set askew from the vertical: even the letters, means the poet, have lost their aplomb before the moral horror. (A textual note: there are those, and their name is legion, 4 who read "Hugh Inta Mittley" in the second line. But nothing in Skilmer's emotional history gives countenance to a suppositious passion for Anne's little brother Hugh, then three years and some months old.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4. A tree that looks it! — Gawd! Auld, eh? And Liffs hurl eavey alms, tout prêts . And so it goes. The world-weariness, the melancholy, Skilmer in the depths of his Hamlet mood, or what he himself ruefully called, in the bad German he had learned from "certain ladies" in Milwaukee, "meines Hamletische Gesauerpusskeit". Does even Hamlet, whom so many have called the "Danish Skilmer", have a line so weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable as "A tree that looks it"? — in which the poet accepts the humble monotony of things as they are in their weary haecceitas , the sad fact that they are only what they are, and so fully look what they are, instead of embodying the splendor of their Platonic archetypes. "The interminable pyramical napkin," broods E. E. Cummings — but how sesquipedalian this in comparison with Skilmer's demotic oomph. And from time immemorial this nauseating sameness — old indeed, and more than old. Probably there is no more plangent understatement in the language than Skilmer's simple but despairing "auld". For the poet, unable to tear his ravaged heart from thoughts of Thrane, glumly Scotticizes: "Auld, eh?" he spits out, thereby more keenly identifying Thrane with all he most distrusts in reality. Cosmic gloom induces wide-ranging speculations: the bard's restless mind hovers around the anthropology he loved so deeply, and from what sad strata of the past he must have disinterred his pregnant and touching lines about the Liffs. A Liff, as we know now, is the baseborn son of a Riff father and a Lett mother. * But even a Liff, born who knows where in semi-savagery, may hurl the alms of charity (as the miserly Thrane never did), alms that shelter us like eaves from the cold and rook-delighting heaven, alms that are always ready, tout prêts , to relieve us. In his polyglot technique, Skilmer, as so often, again anticipates the practice of Ezra Pound, his foremost epigone: he uses the French words to imply that even the barbarous Liffs have achieved a measure of urbanity, as compared with certain uncivilized Scots he could mention. The touch of Gallic vivacity brightens, but all too briefly, the poem's Stygian verge. (Again, a textual note: some read "A tree that looks two ", and explain it as referring to the illusory nature of perceived reality. Rubbish! 5 ).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5. A tree . . . that Mayan summer! 'Ware Honesta Robbins! Henna hair! In explicating this locus classicus of modern poetry, it is necessary to bear in mind certain facts about the manuscripts — or "menu-scraps", as Skilmer himself wryly called them. Always a victim of poverty, the poet used to quill his sublimest ditties on the backs of labels laboriously soaked off the bottles of whiskey on which he shrewdly spent what little means the world afforded him. Thousands of these labels have survived, mute testimony to the trembling fingers that treasured them — each bearing only a few words of that great cornucopia of song he willed posterity. (There are also three labels from spaghetti cans, and one from a small can of succotash.) A study of some hundreds of manuscripts shows that Skilmer first wrote "A tree . . . that Aztec summer!" — a reference to the year he spent in Central America with an anthropological expedition. An idyllic year, possibly the happiest of his life, when his natural warmth and high spirits, so often thwarted by dingy circumstance, overflowed with an almost boyish ebullience. Arriving in early May, he had been married there three times by late June — and each time happily. Hence the little idyll about the Aztec summer, found on the manuscript Old Overholt 202 and certain others. (The spaghetti labels have little authority.) But the definitive reading is to be found on Heaven Hill 714 : not "Aztec" but "Mayan", a word which Skilmer pronounced with the long a of May . "A tree . . . that Mayan summer!" — and there it is forever, the bright leaves bathed in a golden haze of old romance, lost histories. An idyll, yes — but before long Skilmer's domestic bliss was shattered. He was followed to Yucatan by Mrs. Chloe P. Robbins of Ashtabula, a steamfitter's widow. With her came her daughter, the 47-year-old Honesta Lou, whom Skilmer called his "buxom nymph o' siren voice" — she was six feet two, her flaring red hair vivid with purple highlights. It is this vision of somewhat menacing loveliness that is now evoked in lines that recall Coleridge's Beware, beware, His flashing eyes! his floating hair! With deft economy, Skilmer laments the timelessness of his plight by using the archaic "'Ware' for "Beware".</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6. Po' Em's our maid. 'Bye, fools! Like me, Butt only. Godkin may kertree! Almost from the beginning, it was clear to a happy few that what seemed "poem" was really "Po' Em", a poor Southern girl named Emma or Emily. Her identity long eluded researchers, until Dr. Cecily P. Wunkhead, basing her argument largely on blood tests, litmus paper, and Old Crow 1066 (and rejecting the famous "succotash reading" as spurious) proposed that the unknown Em was none other than Emily Dickinson. To show that Emily is the mouthpiece not only for New England but for all America Skilmer resorts to an amazingly simple device: he gives her a southern voice: probably not since Praxilla has the ethos of inner dynamic been so functionally aligned with dialectal specificity. And why Emily Dickinson? Because she is the American Muse, ever at our side to lend a helping hand with torch on high — a servant, she, of servants of the laurel. Po' Em's our maid , and with our trust in her we can afford to dismiss the vulgar many, as Skilmer does with much the same testy arrogance that Yeats and Jonson flaunted. Whereas Jonson needed ten words or so in his Far from the wolves' dark jaw, and the black asses' hoof . . . Skilmer does it in two burning words, "'Bye, fools!" But immediately compassion returns, and he remembers that the ordinary man, just as he, is only a butt for the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. This might have set a-moping a less resilient bard, but Skilmer recovers, to conclude with a thundering diapason of Jubel und Ruhm such as not even Beethoven has ever equalled: the magnificent "Godkin may kertree!" Godkin: a little god, that least of the divinities in man, godkin may — but how the gala vowel, long a , implies lyric certainty in a word which, heard by the intellect alone, might seem to allow for doubt. May what? He may "kertree"! It is fitting that the pinnacle of Skilmer's sublimity should glitter in this final phrase of his greatest poem. And how like him to achieve sublimity by means so simple! Here he seizes from its lexical limbo the humble prefix ker -, as in kerplunk , kerplop , kerflooie . A prefix that only once before in English had assumed nobility, in J. F. Dudley-Andover's sublime translation of Dante's E caddi come corpo morto cade as I plopped kerplunk, as corpses plop kerplunk. Holding the precious ker - in the jeweler's forceps of his wit, Skilmer works it into a new thing entirely by fusing it with the unexpected "tree": to "kertree", to burst into flower, into foliage, nay, into very tree itself! One sees the creativity of the universe, the vital breath taking form in a great efflorescence of green, a cosmic sneeze as if the whole sweet growth of April and May, by some cinematic magic, were effected in an instant. 6 It is around this magical last line that scholarship itself tends oftenest to kertree. "Godkin" in particular has stimulated the finest hermeneutic acumen of our century to new Everests of perception. Professor Fiedler has explored in depth the profound viscerality of "gutkin". The Cambridge School has constructed a breath-taking new theory of the origin of tragedy on the reading "goat-kin". It is hardly surprising that "incentive psychologists" make much of "goadkin". Professor Fitts, citing γαδ - and χυων , finds a fish-dog, or dogfish, allusion that unfortunately cannot be discussed in these pages. Nor can the suggestion of certain Welshmen, who urge an early form of "gwiddcwyngh". Professor Rákóczi is more to the point in reminding us of what careless readers might forget: "gyödzskin" is a medieval South Hungarian gypsy cant word (though hardly the most common) for a thickish wine made out of half-rotted artichokes: what vistas open here! Only recently Nopançópi Hópail has removed the whole question from the field of linguistic speculation to that of biographical allusion by proposing — how imaginatively! — that "godkin" is "Godkin": E. L. Godkin (1831-1902), who came to America from Ireland when twenty-five, founded The Nation , and was a disciple of the Bentham-Mill-Grote school of philosophy. On the whole subject, however, no one commands more respect than Professor Fredson Bowers, whose monumental fifty-volume edition of Skilmer, The Fourteen Poems and Certain Fragments , is promised for 1970 by the Southeastern Arkansas Junior Teachers' College Press. As early as 1962 Professor Bowers wrote: "I wonder if you have thoroughly considered the evidence of Old Crow 16 ? In this version, possibly a trial, 'May' is capitalized and must therefore be taken as the month. 7 If this is so, the possibility obtains that the godkin referred to is the month of May, and hence we can explain the diminutive. After all, in the month of vernal growth there is something godlike in the creative surge of the sap and the burgeoning of the chlorophyll. However, the syntax is then in question. There is perhaps no need to associate 'godkin May' with the 'butt', even though a month that pretends to be a little god might be a butt for something. I think on the whole we are to take 'godkin May's' activities with approval, not with disapproval. If so, then I suggest that Skilmer, overcome with the wonder of vegetable love and the rites of spring, finds that normal syntax deserts him and is reduced to two paired but mutually discrete exclamations. 'Godkin May!' or: Oh the wonder of it all! And then that exclamation that sums up the plosive force of May, 'Kertree!'" This is brilliantly reasoned and would seem to be the last word on the subject — but Professor Bowers had not yet done with it. A few years later he decided that the line had further subtleties, which he explained, in bibliographical terms, as follows: "It could be read as a series of ejaculations, rising to a climax. The lack of punctuation appropriate for this reading is of course nothing unusual with Skilmer. That is: only Godkin — the one God — He only. Then, in remembered ecstasy of that Mexican spring, May [and here Professor Bowers shows his grasp of contemporary allusion] just busting out all over, like the bursting sap, the springing leaf, in the ultimate mystical union with Nature, kertree! Thus exclamation points should be placed after each unit. I suggest these are at least alternate readings." But perhaps these are matters beyond the power of man to determine. However it may be, Godkin may indeed kertree — but it takes a poet of supreme insight to perceive this, a poet able to wrest language from dead strata of the past and kerplunk it living in the midst of men. But explication is no substitute for the poem. Here, for the first time presented in its ur-textual splendor, is what many * would consider the greatest lyric poem of our literature: THERESE By Joe E. Skilmer I think? That I shall never, see! Up, owe 'em love. Leah's a tree. A tree — who's hung? Greymouth is pressed Upon the earth-Swede, Flo Ingbrest. Upon whose boozin's (no!) has lain Anne D'Intagh Mittley — lives wi' Thrane. A tree that looks it! — Gawd! Auld, eh? And Liffs hurl eavey alms, tout prêts . A tree . . . that Mayan summer! 'Ware Honesta Robbins! Henna hair! Po' Em's our maid. 'Bye, fools! Like me, Butt only. Godkin may kertree! SONNET 129 These sad fragments, so like the papyri of Sappho preserved in the hot dry sands of Oxyrrhynchus (in Egypt), were recovered, tattered and charred, from a box of hot dry sand at Luxor (in South Dakota), which had been kept near a woodstove in the railroad station for the use of brakemen. Typed out by Skilmer, the poem is indubitably his, since it bears in his own handwriting the inscription "My fav[o]rite poem." A writer as careful with words as our poet would hardly write "my" if he meant the exact opposite: "someone else's". Even these poor scraps were preserved only by a lucky chance. Run through a meatgrinder (luckily coarse) with the daily hamburger, the mélange was promptly bolted by a small coonhound named Harold, whose stomach as promptly rejected the unwonted fare, depositing it unceremoniously on the warm sand by the stove, where the pieces were buried from sight as the sands shifted in drafts from the opening door. Fortunately, the very next day a head-on collision killed sixty-six passengers and tore up a half mile of track. The spur line was not thought worth repairing; the station was closed, and only an occasional vagrant would stoke up the stove that kept warm the fostering sand. The papyroids are somewhat stained by tobacco juice. Discovered by an amateur thrill-seeker in 1953, they were entrusted to Professor Koch-Schurr for restoration. Schooled in the methods of J. M. Edmonds (who from a ten-word fragment of Sappho was unfailingly able to reconstruct the lost original, many times as long), Professor Koch-Schurr set to work. He immediately perceived that the key lay in such words as "expense", "trust", — and, for the poet's attitude — "blame". The poem, he concluded, was therefore an attack on an economic system. "Spirit[s]", in Skilmer's vocabulary, almost surely meant the kind of spirits he knew best. Working from this slim basis of certainty, Professor Koch-Schurr succeeded in restoring the poem to what most scholars will agree is essentially what Skilmer wrote. Here, then, given for the first time to a waiting world, is one of the bard's most significant masterpieces exactly as he may have written it — a very fundament of the mighty corpus! SONNET 129 The expense of spirits is a crying shame! Is lust for lucre (money, man!). 'Twould bust 'Is personal nest-egg was 'e Croesus! — blame Savings &amp; Loans that back the liquor trust.

CUTTY SARK 711 ( Dover Sole ) Cutty Sark 711 (fondly called "The Emperor Manuscript") gives us the only known "fair copy" of a Skilmer poem. This precious document, the glory of the British Museum, bears some of the characteristic watermarks found on many of the poet's papers: they are circular and about four centimeters across (roughly the size of a standard "jigger" or "shot glass"). Many things about this touching relic, so rich in humanity, suggest that something fierier than mere quill of mortal has been here set down. It is little wonder that a leading critic of Belleville (Illinois) has called it "a very Sinai of the spirit". The text of Dover Sole has been extensively studied. Apparently one of the poet's earliest works, it shows a thorough familiarity with the achievements of English poetry up to, and perhaps beyond, his time. Academic critics, insensitive to the workings of inspiration and true creativity, have dismissed it as "derivative" and even "sheer pastiche"! Almost heartbreaking in their ruined beauty are Skilmer's jottings around the margin — mere luminous inklings of a dawn no sooner bloomed than blasted. Of the haunting "Time is a toadstool on the nose of love", I.A. Leavis-Beehynde has written, "If this is not the finest metaphor in recent European literature, I just don't know what." And surely no poet has ever so summed up the spirit of the American desert, its unpeopled multi-scorpioned mirage-bemused vastitudes, the lone charisma of its sandy avatars, as has our poet in his Once more at dawn I drive The weary cattle of my soul to the mudhole of your eyes. The numerals and occult code-names on "The Emperor" would seem to be part of a system the secretive poet devised to record his rhythmical inventions. Instead of just saying ta-dum , da-dum .</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Tudor Roses from John Tate by Allan Stevenson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Most accounts of the beginnings of papermaking in England tell us that the first mill was established near Hertford by John Tate the younger and that his paper-mark was a Flower or Star or Wheel. There has been some uncertainty as to whether this John Tate was the son of John Tate or of Sir John Tate, both of them Mercers and Mayors of London. 1 And there has been much uncertainty as to what the device represents, for it is a conventional or mathematical figure consisting of eight thin loops within a two-line circle about an inch and a quarter (32 mm) across. No botanist would accept it as a composite, for though it has rays like an aster it has no center flowers. No astronomer would recognize it as a star, for it has eight beams roughly pointed at both ends. And no wheelwright would fashion a wheel with spokes not reaching the rim. Nevertheless, as there are eight of these floating spokes, as in a comic-strip cartwheel or waterwheel, I call it sometimes the Wheel of Tate. Briquet, caught in the same trilemma, classifies it as a Fleur (Br 6608) and congratulates himself on having included a single English watermark among his 16,112 filigranes . What hardly anyone has been uncertain about is that Tate used but a single mark. To be sure, Plomer mentioned the possibility of other marks, but he knew only of one. 2 Heawood reproduced just one, and that in quarter size, and then (curiously) did not include it in his collection published in 1950. 3 Shorter, without going to original sources, reproduced two mythical examples from Powell and an acceptable mark from Clapperton; 4 then Labarre dropped these three sizes of pancakes on to a ready-made grid of chainlines and wirelines which have nothing to do with the mark. 5 Jenkins furnished a single engine-turned example. 6 A more realistic tracing appears in the Victoria History of the County of Hertford , drawn by Lewis Evans from a 'blank leaf' in De proprietatibus rerum . 7 Clapperton alone presents an excellent photograph, from the same book, reproduced by collotype. 8 Though a better leaf might have been chosen, this is a reproduction to be grateful for. Yet all seem to have been unaware that the watermark is twins. Briquet himself did not seek out an original example but reproduced Jenkins' prettified tracing, and so, contrary to Briquet's usual method, without benefit of chains. 9 It is in accord with his practice that Briquet ignores the fact of twins: two similar but distinguishable marks from the pair of moulds handled by vatman and coucher. 10 In this sense John Tate certainly had more than a single mark. Four books contain runs of this handsome Tate paper, three proud and important folios plus one thin supplementary folio, all from the atelier of Wynkyn de Worde: Bartholomaeus: De proprietatibus rerum , tr. Caxton [1495] Jacobus de Voragine: The Golden Legend , tr. Trevisa (8 Jan. 1498) Chaucer: The Canterbury Tales (1498) Lydgate: The Assembly of the Gods [1498] 11 The Bartholomaeus has the famous verses at its end in which Wynkyn tells us that the paper was supplied by Tate: And John Tate the yonger Joye mote he broke Whiche late hathe in Englond doo make this paper thynne That now in our englyssh this boke is prynted Inne He tells further (in effect) that Caxton had learned to print in Cologne while working on a Bartholomaeus in Latin, and so later had translated the text for English use. De Worde's edition is a thick volume of 478 leaves, nearly half a ream of paper, and the fine Grenville-British Museum copy measures 12 x 8.6", whereas the Sir Joseph Banks-British Museum copy measures only 9.9 x 7.7". The paper is fine in quality, except that not all of it is thin, and that the mid part of the book shows bits of grit within its pulp — as if sand had blown across Papermill Mead and into the stuff while the vatman was plunging his moulds into it. These imperfections are sharp to the touch and unlike anything I have encountered elsewhere in paper. Hereabouts the paper is a trifle rusty also. The Legenda offers the same text that Caxton had used in the only book he printed on large paper, made mainly by Antonio Gallizian at Basel. 12 Now it was printed on small paper made by the son of John Tate the elder, presumably one of Caxton's friends of the Mercers' Company. 13 The volume contains 449 leaves, almost as many as the Bartholomaeus before it. As in that volume the Wheel marks look forth from a 'window' nearly a quarter inch wide between columns. The marks do not seem so fresh as they did, and there are shadows along some chains; and occasionally there are small knots, perhaps bits of wool, within the linen stuff. The rim of one mark has got flatter or thinner in one place, as we can see in the open spaces in the Tabula. The Chaucer is a shorter folio of just 157 leaves. As it was finished not long after the Legenda aurea , its paper is in a similar state, with perhaps a higher proportion of thick leaves. The marks are now a little easier to see because of the jagged verse endings and reuse of the cuts that Caxton had placed in his second edition. The book is rare, the Morgan copy being a fine one, the British Museum copy having several early leaves in facsimile by Harris, and others are at Folger and Illinois. 14 The Lydgate poem contains just 16 folio leaves and represents a continuation of the paper stock in the Canterbury Tales . Perhaps it was a way of using up a remainder of Tate stock. (Two other Wynkyn de Worde editions are in quarto.) Only the Pierpont Morgan copy is complete, for the copy bound after the British Museum Canterbury Tales contains one leaf in facsimile, A7, and lacks the (unwatermarked) final leaf. The four folios contain 478+449+157+16 = 1100 leaves or 550 edition sheets. If the edition of the relatively common Bartholomaeus was around 500 copies and those of the other three around 250, the whole effort must have used some eight hundred reams, if we include something for trial, make ready, and waste. In order to keep going a papermill would need to sell considerably more paper than that. We know of a few further edition-sheets. Presumably the mill at Hertford began operation in 1494, for the first publication using the Tate mark has a text dated that year. This was a reissue in Latin of the Papal Bull of Innocent VIII, in which Alexander VI concurred, showing their pleasure in the marriage of Henry Tudor and Elizabeth of York (though cousins of some degree) and in recognition of Henry as the rightful occupant of the English throne. The earlier edition had been printed by William de Machlinia as an English broadside in his bâtard type on Gothic p paper from Lorraine (de Worde's country) after 27 March 1486. 15 The Latin Bull of Wynkyn de Worde is a document of 85 lines in textura, a broadside printed similarly along the chains and down the sheet. There are six copies extant. 16 The Library of St John's College Cambridge owns two incomplete exemplars, halfsheet fragments, showing the twin Wheel marks in the preserved lower portions of the sheets, behind a single layer of type. It is thus possible to make out the relation of the marks to the individual chain-patterns. A copy at Ripon Cathedral is much repaired. It is the copy at Lambeth Palace Library (Maitland Fragment 7) that has been famed as the earliest extant piece of English paper. Though it has a hundred small wormholes, the broadsheet is intact except for two spots along creases where parts of words have been lost. The sheet is from Mould E and it measures 11.9 x 17" cut. The mark is clear though it has two or three small wormholes in it. As in the St John's College copies it occurs in the lower end of the sheet. Eton College has two copies of this Bull of [1494], used as pastedowns in J. Reuchlin: De rudimentis hebraicis (Pforzheim: T. Anshelm, 1506) F°. Though cropped at the top, they are otherwise in good state, except that the rear flyleaf hangs by a thread of paper. The front sheet hides its Wheel within pasted paper, but the rear one shows its mark clearly enough. It also is from Mould E, to be described presently. It is a later abbreviated restatement of this Bull that provides the best opportunity for studying the paper of John Tate. Though Duff assigned it to [1495], Pollard noted that it was issued as a supplementary proclamation by Henry VII to a further Bull of Alexander VI. The text of the Bull is in British Museum MS Cleopatra E. III. 147 and is dated 12. kal. Jan. 1498. 'The proclamation, therefore, must be not earlier than the end of Jan. or the beginning of Feb. 1499.' 17 The coarsening of the watermarks and chainlines accords very well with the date [1499], which places it after the three folios of 1498. The proclamation was a device for reassuring the populace during the period of Perkin Warbeck's high pretensions; and to the first Tudor monarch it seemed good to have a pair of popes, Innocent and Alexander, on his side. As Wynkyn de Worde printed it, the Supplementary Proclamation is a document of just eleven textura lines in double column. Thus he found it possible to place two different settings (with minor variants) on each halfsheet, parallel with the chains, so that there was space between; and these through print-and-turn became four short proclamations to the sheet. If just one ream was printed, it made available two thousand pieces of persuasion in favor of the Tudor dynasty. The space between permits a clear and unimpeded view of the Wheel of Tate, almost the only full view of the 'naked' mark in any publication. We can examine the particular treatment of the mark by the mouldmaker, its position on the supporting chain, its relation to the other chains in the watermarked end of the mould. We see that the moulds were Italianate, perhaps made for Tate by a workman from Genoa. In the unwatermarked half of the sheet the spacing of the chains is uniform, with the spaces averaging around 35 mm. But in the watermarked end the spacing varies, so as to provide the watermark with a supporting chain through its center and a place between attendant chains. Beyond these two accompanying chains the mouldmaker has erred in his spacing on one mould but worked out his spacing satisfactorily on the second. For convenience we may call the mould with unequal attendant spaces Mould U and that with equal attendant spaces Mould E, and the consequent watermarks U and E. As the chains can be seen not merely within the blank space between the eleven-line proclamations but within all margins of Tate books, this space-difference proves an infallible method for distinguishing the twin marks. The exact measurements need to be set down. As the watermarks are round, it is not easy to know which ends of their moulds they were sewn on, though it was a period when marks of the Rhine valley (for instance) commonly were moulded as twins in opposite ends of the sheet, even when the wire designs were placed in the same end of their moulds. When there are no inscriptions or heraldic bearings that prevent, we commonly reckon with the mould side of the paper up. With marks such as Tate's which are ambiguous in their orientation we may treat them as in either end of the sheet. Here, for later comparison, we shall consider them as in the right end, and so measure from the quire-fold across chains and mark towards the edge or deckle, or else across chains in the margins. In practice measurements, in so narrow a unit as the millimeter, vary slightly, because chains are not absolutely parallel, because some move slightly on the mould, because paper sometimes shrinks, because we cannot use the same steel ruler or transparent plastic ruler (which themselves are slightly variable) in all situations and over a span of years. In earlier measurements I tried to read them to the nearest tick on the scale; in later measurements I have given chains that clearly fall between ticks a half-millimeter value. Yet despite the variables facts and truth emerge from a series of measurements. Luckily, because of the supporting chain, this Tate watermark does not wander or slip along the laid wires in the manner of Bull's heads and other small marks of the time. See the appendix table on Chainspaces Accompanying the Tate Wheel Watermark. All the while the twin marks from the Tate moulds differ, as twin marks do, in details of shape and sewing dots and position between attendant chains. For instance, in the Bartholomaeus (Newberry copy) Mark U measures 36|8[17|16]8|28 mm and Mark E 35|8[16|17]10|36 mm, reading from left to right with marks in right folio. The vertical lines indicate chains, the square brackets the width of the watermark. It is amusing to note that in the Uneven Mould the mark is centered neatly within its broad chainspace, while in the Even Mould it is not quite centered. If one could always see that distinction, that would be sufficient for distinguishing the two marks. The shapes are sufficiently regular to make for uncertainties, though Mark E is actually slightly taller (more oval) than the other. Also, a sharp eye may note that the rim of Mark E is more even than that of Mark U, which (with right-end mould-side orientation) has bulges in the southeast and southwest. And some of the Dots are misleading because they are situated on the star points, while those on the circles are a score or more but small and hard to see behind type. It is thus more convenient to distinguish them by means of their chain-patterns. What is evident at a glance is that the spaces beyond the attendant chains are definitely unequal in one mould and virtually equal in the other. In Mould U these attendant spaces average 36 and 28 mm, with a difference of about 8 mm. In Mould E the corresponding attendant spaces measure 34 and 35 or 35 and 36 mm, with a difference of no more than 1 mm. As these chains, clear in the watermark space in the Supplement, are regularly visible in margins, this method of distinction becomes the one to use while we turn the leaves of a Tate folio or quarto. Of this Supplement (Duff 229, STC 14098) five copies are now known. The fountainhead was Magdalen College Oxford, where four remainders of the broadside were found stuffed in a binding. Magdalen magnanimously distributed copies to the British Museum, the Bodleian, and the University Library Cambridge; but the Eton College Library copy turned up in one of their own bindings. 18 In all these copies the mark is clear and photographable, except that the Bodleian copy shows paste and the Cambridge a little ink on the mark. The Eton copy of the Supplement is a halfsheet found in the binding of Gabriel Zerbus: Liber anathomie corporis humani (Venice: B. Locatellus, 1502) F°. When I examined this piece of Tate paper, there was an anxious moment. The four copies emanating from Magdalen College had proved one by one to be all from Mould E. Naturally I hoped now for the other mould. As the leaf law within its host volume, I could see faintly the rounded form of the Wheel rim. The mark was in the preserved end of the sheet. Breathless, I turned the leaf up to the light. The attendant spaces were unequal! At last I beheld Mark U without interfering black type. It was photogenic. See the plate. 19 The search for further examples of Tate's watermarks, of further books printed on the earliest English paper, has produced interesting results. First it is well to note the latest known appearance of the paper, in 'Loose sheets' at the Library of Canterbury Cathedral, dated 1512. This paper was recorded by Michael Beazeley, F.R.G.S., Hon. Librarian, within the excellent collection of tracings which he made from Canterbury documents in 1896-1900 and presented to the British Museum in 1912. 20 Again the mark he reproduces is from Mould E. But Beazeley is the only filigranist to show the attendant chains and spaces. As he reproduces them, the measurements across the mark are 36|4[20.5|18.5]7|34; but the bulges on the rim seem to be overemphasized, so that the rim varies from 1 mm to 4 mm in thickness. He notes that there are 30 wirelines to an inch and that the sheet measures 13.75 x 19” uncut. This is most interesting information. This first English paper was of the size known as Bastard, that is oversize in comparison with the norm. 21 In an accompanying notebook Beazeley says this is 'The first &amp; only specimen met with of John Tate's paper among the Canterbury materials'. Two further Tate books have been discovered by H. Clifford Maggs, among Wynkyn de Worde's books after the turn of the century. In Maggs Catalogue 830 (1957), in discussing the Legenda aurea with its Wheel mark, Mr Maggs noted that Tate paper occurs in two later quartos. In a letter of 29 July 1957 he kindly informed me of his research at the British Museum in 1935, when he examined Wynkyn de Worde books of 1501 to 1517 and came upon Tate Wheels in Thordynary of crysten men (1506) and The Justyces of paes (1510) ( STC 5199 and 14864). The Justyces of paes is a typical example of a book containing an intrusive remnant of paper hidden within the volume in the manner suggested by Moxon. 22 Such a random sheet would not be useful for dating an undated book. As Mr Maggs indicated, there is just one instance in the British Museum copy, within the inner gully of sheet d: d2.3, where the rim of the Wheel emerges from the spine in both leaves. A similar sheet occurs in the Bodleian copy but not in the Huntington fragment. 23 One might suspect that this sheet is a gathering from an earlier edition, such as the 1506 quarto at the Huntington ( STC 14863); but the point is not yet resolved. Other sheets of the 1510 edition show Pot marks within narrow chainspaces of 23 mm, paper from Champagne or Normandy. Thordynary of 1506 had been preceded by a quarto of 1502, entitled The Ordynarye of Crystyanyte or of crysten men ( STC 5198). As Frank Isaac shows in pages reproduced from both quartos, they were set in different 95 texturas. 24 The 1502 quarto contains only Hand watermarks, from Genoa or Piedmont. The 1506 quarto collates Aa 4 A 6 B-X 4/8 AA-MM 4/8 NN 4 OO-PP 6 = 218 leaves or 54.5 sheets. The alternating pattern of single and double quarto sheets gives the printer opportunities for using up remnants of paper. I first examined the Harmsworth-Folger copy (in 1958) and was pleased to find in its gullies remnants of the Wheel paper in gatherings A, D, and X, much as Mr Maggs had led me to expect. From three instances of Tate paper at intervals within a volume containing runs of other Flower paper and Hand papers (with once only a Gothic y from Champagne), it was easy to infer that de Worde was making use of Wheel paper left over from his supply for the Legenda aurea and the Canterbury Tales . But this inference proved only partly right. When later I was able to examine a copy at the British Museum, the copy that Maggs had handled, then a copy at Cambridge, and on return to America the copy at the Pierpont Morgan Library, I was amused and then puzzled at the way in which the Wheels moved about in the book. I began to make watermark collations showing the positions of the Wheels among the Hands and the Flowers, which I now saw were Roses, broken within the quarto fold. The Wheels were not behaving in the manner of other remnants that I had encountered in printed books. In Hamlet Q2, for instance, the remnant Pot from the Lower Loire with the date 1598 on its belly is hidden away in a middle gathering (as Moxon later recommended). But here the Wheel paper appeared in well separated gatherings: at B D X in the BM copy examined by Maggs, at D H in a second BM copy, at B C D X in the Douce copy at Bodley, at A C D F in the other Bodleian copy, at A D X in the ULC copy, at D X in the Folger copy, and at C D P X in the Morgan copy. Sometimes the position varied in two-watermark gatherings. The only consistent set of occurrences was in single-sheet D, though also the Wheel turned up five times out of seven in the inner sheet of X. Not until I returned to the Folger copy, after examining three others, did I know the answer. Then suddenly I realized that Thordynary contains other paper manufactured by John Tate. Among the ambiguities three principal facts stood out: the Roses so intermingled with the Wheels are surely Tudor Roses . . . and the two papers have the same Italian chain pattern and the same substance. A Tudor Rose is of course a double rose compounded of the Red Rose of Lancaster and the White Rose of York. Though the Rose watermark has no contrasting colors, it shows prettily and convincingly five cordiform petals with sepals between and in the midst thereof a similar group of five small petals overlapping the larger ones. It is a free treatment of the heraldic rose, not a Gallic or garden rose with multiple petals. Here it arrives auspiciously as a symbol of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, within their reign, which lasted till 1509, and within the lifetime of John Tate, who died in 1507, the year after Thordynary was published. In his will, now at Somerset House, Tate mentions supplies of paper still on hand: 'as moche whit paper or other paper as shall extende to the somme of xxvj s 8 d . . . owte of my paper myll at Hartford'. 25 As this was a particular bequest to Thomas Bolls of Hertford (who may have been Tate's foreman) and evidently not all the paper on hand, the common assumption that paper manufacture at the Sele Mill (or its predecessor) lasted through the time of Wynkyn's folios of 1498 only is probably incorrect. It may be objected that such Roses may have come instead out of Italy or France. The chain pattern indeed might suggest Genoese make or influence, just as it did for the Wheel marks. But Briquet knew of few double roses in Italian paper. As for France, an enterprising Norman maker appears to have anticipated the Tudor Rose by a year or so. Consider Briquet 6628, a Rose with stem and leaves which comes from Cuy (Orne) near Argentan dated 1484. 26 Three quarters of a century later a Rose of Tudor form appears upon a small Shield in petit petit papier (24.5 x 31 cm): Br 6431 (1561). As Briquet found this mark among the Archives of Calvados in tabellionage from Troarn, east of Caen in the direction of Lisieux, the paper probably came from the Pays d'Auge, which had supplied Unicorn paper to England. The Shield contains, above the rose, one of the earliest names in Norman paper: I LOYSEL. A century still later Rose paper was made in the Bocage near Sourdeval with the name-abbreviation MLO for M LOYSEL, as well as NGM for N GERMAIN and ILG for I LEGRAND (Heawood 1886, 1888-9, 1902a). The Rose MLO paper occurs for example in Daniel King: The Vale-Royall of England (J. Streater 1656) pot F°. 27 These double Roses come from the region that supplied paper to England for nearly two centuries. Nevertheless it was proper for an English mill to make her own roses. Around 1600 England again had a white paper mill, in which John Spilman, Elizabeth I's jeweler and papermaker, made suitable paper for printed books and manuscripts. Curiously, no Jenkins, Heawood, or Shorter has sought out more than two or three of Spilman's watermarks, whereas I have encountered perhaps eight. 28 But this is not Spilman's inning, except for a Tudor Rose that seems to be his. It occurs, with pitiful irony, in the midst of that Proclamation which denounces the Earls of Essex, Rutland, and Southampton as traitors (1600/1) ( STC 8279). The Tudor Rose is unmistakable in the Huntington copy, where I first came upon it, as also in two British Museum copies. For Essex this symbol of Tudor authority must have seemed the unkindest of his career, and its thorn cut to the heart — as Lytton Strachey would have enjoyed saying. Other evidence have I none, except that the texture and chain-rhythm of the Essex paper fit neatly and persuasively with those of other sorts of paper made at Dartford in Kent. And this is partly the nature of the proof for the Tudor Roses of John Tate. It is probable that the same Italian mouldmaker who had made the Wheel moulds and marks made the Rose moulds and marks as well. For the Roses are situated on supporting chains precisely in the manner of the Wheels, with a few millimeters on either side within the watermark double space and similar attendant spaces beyond. The two Roses are so similar that they may well derive from the same design. Indeed, when I first admired these Roses in the BM copy of Thordynary stamped with the royal arms, 29 I grew amazed that there should seem to be but one mould — a thing unparalleled in my experience with small paper, though I could understand the possibility of it in the making of so huge a size as Antiquarian. But then when I turned to the King's Library copy, I was able to make out small differences. I began to make sketches of the bits of Roses showing in the gullies, as they slid back and forth across the spine, building up two similar but different designs, never seeing as much as half a rose between fold and type. As often in such situations of near-identity, it was a chainline the top heart-shaped petal at contrasting points, though the difference is hardly more than two millimeters. Because no photograph can present the composite effect from a number of gullies, I reproduce these pencil-sketches, rough and inaccurate as they are, to fill in selected Contoura prints. It will be seen that in one mould the supporting chain cuts near the vent in the top petal and then between two smaller center petals, and in the other along the edge of the top petal and then across an inner heartlike petal. If we look at the indented or mould side, the edge coinciding with the chain is to the right. But again it may be more convenient to differentiate by chain-pattern. In the mould with the chain cutting near the center of the petal, reading the chains from fold to foot, we find they measure 34.5 33.5 23.5 18.5 36.5 36; and in the sheets with chain slong the petal edge they measure 33 34.5 19.5 16.5 33.5 36.5; wherefore the first may be called Mould U, with a 3 mm difference between attendant spaces, and the second Mould E, with a 1 mm difference. Always (or almost always) in Filigranistan there are two moulds; always they are distinguishable. 30 As yet I can give no precise measurements for both Rose marks. When they turn up, as they should, in some manuscript, perhaps a royal one, then we can measure with mathematical glee. All this may seem insufficiently convincing that the Rose paper is Tate's. But final and sufficient evidence resides in the character and the texture of the paper, the stuff from which it was made. For the Rose paper and the Wheel paper obviously came out of the same vatstuff. In this volume they have the same yellow-whiteness, with the same liability to slight foxing, the same tendency to closefelted thickness, some sheets of both being overly thick, and, most telling of all, the same flecks and occasional clots of foreign matter, perhaps knots from woolen underwear. For the paper is indeed 'naughty', as Moxon would have said. Tate's once-beautiful paper has slipped a long way in quality. Or else this is paper remaining after the good sheets have been culled out, used along with good quires or reams. As there are about a dozen known copies of Thordynary of crysten men , bibliographers can examine the book and judge the evidence for themselves. In an accompanying table I show the Distribution of Watermarks in seven copies. The distribution suggests that de Worde used the Wheel and Rose papers as if they were one, except for the runs of Wheel in gatherings D and X, or else that the paper came from the mill with some reams made up of both sorts. In any case short runs of Rose paper occur, into which the Wheel paper intrudes; and sometimes the Wheel in one copy is opposite a Rose in other copies. We might be satisfied to let the argument rest there. But the distribution table brings forward another question which has lurked behind the Wheel and Rose papers. Is there a third Tate paper in this volume? What of the Hand &amp; star paper which we find associated with the Rose paper? The question is worth a short exploration. Unfortunately we do not know how many presses the printer was using, how he fed paper to them, whether there was an advantage for him (beyond ease in binding) in printing in alternating fours and eights. 31 There are two contrasting sorts of Hand paper in the book. The main one, the one associated with the Rose and Wheel papers, has a Hand &amp; star mark with close fingers and is situated on a regular chain in the Genoese manner. It is the sort of Hand that the Norman paper-makers began to imitate twenty years later, producing what the printer Thomas Berthelet called 'jene' in his bill to Henry VIII. 32 The chain-spaces are 30-32 mm wide, with a tranchefile space of about 17 mm. 33 Though in these points the Hand paper does not correspond to the Rose and Wheel papers, the fineness of the wire or laid lines does. The other, coming late in the volume, is a Hand mark without star but with separated fingers, of a sort preferred by other makers at Genoa and in Piedmont. And now we note that this open-fingered paper uses supporting chains in the manner of the Rose and Wheel papers. Some of these separated Hands show an x or α on the palm and others a pair of circlets, and these may indicate twin marks. This paper comes of a sudden in a single run of seven to ten sheets at the end of the book. It represents a definite shift in paper stock. The Hand &amp; star paper, on the other hand, though it appears mainly in runs, is interrupted by Rose or Wheel paper. Or vice versa. Thus in gatherings B C E the Hand interrupts the flow of Rose-Wheel paper. Then the main run of Hand &amp; star begins with the inner sheet of gathering J and continues for about thirty-two sheets except for interruptions of Rose-Wheel in L P R S T X BB DD, after which Hand &amp; star runs an uninterrupted course for seven sheets, until it yields to the run of separated Hands. It looks as if Wynkyn de Worde regarded the Rose-Wheel and Hand &amp; star papers as a sufficiently homogeneous stock of paper and the Hand separated paper as a satisfactory one to follow with. Are there clues in the physical character of the Hand papers? When I reëxamined the Folger copy, I began to think that the Hand papers might also be Tate's. For again these papers have occasional thick sheets and similar flaws or knots in the stuff, though less often than the Rose and Wheel papers. And there is some variation from copy to copy. If the British Museum copies seem cleaner in this respect than some others, the Oxford and Cambridge copies definitely show the telltale blemishes and bits of foreign matter — some of them apparently bits of brown wool. Perhaps a chemist can determine the contents of these naughty sheets. Meanwhile it looks probable that we now know four kinds of Italianate paper used by John Tate the younger. Joye mote he broke. In conclusion we may consider some of the values in such a study as this. In the present state of our knowledge of paper and what to expect of it in a bibliographical way we see that something has been accomplished, that much remains to do. The gains are of two main kinds. 1) As the history of paper is the history of an important human activity, it deserves notice both for its own sake and for its implications for economics and culture. The French frequently honor it as the suppôt des pensées . Yet among literary historians and critics, and even among 'bibliographers', there are numerous scholars who treat paper as if it were manna from heaven, always there for the picking up, whereas any printer, ancient or modern, can tell them how wrong they are. The availability of paper, of sorts suitable to the book at hand for printing, also considerations of format, quality, and price have continually conditioned the production of books down through time. Yet even most descriptive bibliographers treat it, ostrich-like, almost as if it did not exist. Ignorance has set a pattern which ignorance follows, and thus ignorance becomes a part of standard method, while all the while it is evident that paper and print are the things that books are made of, and thus are worth mention. If this is so, any real increase in information on les origines has an historical value, and thus a use in book description. When we consider writing the first chapter in the history of English paper, a history shorter than that of other nations, we find, not too much to our astonishment, that few have adequately reproduced the first English watermark. Indeed, there are acceptable tracings by Jenkins, Lewis, and Beazeley, but only the last of these (not published) provides the chainlines essential for accurate depiction and in this case for distinguishing one mould from another. But tracings are always distortions (more or less), always fallible interpretations by the human hand and eye, and sometimes (as in this geometrical design) prettifications of what shows in the paper. Only Clapperton (it seems) has published a photographic collotype, and that in a costly limited edition, and presumably more for showing the normal appearance of the mark in a Wynkyn de Worde folio than for making details of the mark clear. This can be done, for instance, from the Tabula in the Golden Legend . A dozen years ago Erwin Morkisch, the gifted photographer at the Huntington Library, placed the twin Wheel marks on microfilm for me, and I have shown the resultant slides a number of times. Now I offer collotype reproductions of the Tate Wheels from Contoura prints of Mark E in the British Museum copy of the Supplementary Proclamation of [1499] and Mark U from the Eton College copy. I use photocopies rather than photographs because photographers often err as to correct size. The collotypes show the chain-patterns in part so that all may tell the difference between the two moulds. I am not able to do as well by the Tudor Roses. Here as the marks have not yet turned up in folio blanks but mainly in the gullies of one quarto, I have had recourse to partial reproduction through Contoura prints and rough pencil sketches, except for an example which shows through a narrow folio window, to be noted presently. But even these imperfect reproductions should make it possible to seek out examples of John Tate's second watermark more suitable for reproduction in a history of English paper, probably from B-radiographs. In any case something new has been accomplished. Where it has been generally supposed that Tate had but one mark or pair of marks, we now see that he had at least two. The Tudor Roses are surely his, the Hand &amp; star marks probably his, the Hand separated marks possibly his. Always in this art there is something for further investigation. Incidentally, a careful study of the Wheel marks has shown that Tate had but one pair of them, whose prolonged life extended from 1494 to 1499, whereas moulds producing paper in great demand commonly lasted but a year or two. At the same time the study of the Wheel paper has provided a more important gain: a method for demonstrating that the Tudor Rose paper associated with the Wheel paper belongs to John Tate. For bibliographers always searching for new methods this is a real advance. At the same time the device is tricky: where the paper substance is clearly the same, as in the Wheel and Rose papers, we can be certain; where the substance is similar yet a little less knotty, as in the Hand papers, we proceed more cautiously. 2) Naturally, for the bibliographer, studies of paper and watermarks become most interesting when they lead to discovery of facts in the history of book production — and thus often clarification of the texts printed on the paper. It may be that little of this sort will arise from a study of Tate's paper; we may have to be content mainly with historical values. But the spadework must be done before the hyacinth grows and blooms. Like minor Briquets we make ready for future discoveries that we cannot foresee. As the Wheel has a supporting wire to hold it in place, and the Rose also, we do not have the information afforded by a mark that slides along the laid wires. Yet even here the chains accompanying the Wheel become worn and curve at their ends, and the bumps on the rims become more noticeable. Thus even without the facts that have come to light concerning the Supplementary Proclamation since Duff described it, we might have judged that it is closer to 1500 than to Duff's date around 1495. And there also is the upstart Perkin Warbeck to persuade us. One reason for getting acquainted with a paper as special as Tate's is that doing so may bring to light facsimiles and fakes, and so help in the valuation of costly but imperfect books. For instance the titlepage of Bartholomaeus De proprietatibus rerum is a black woodcut containing just those four words and no more. It is thus not difficult to provide a 'reasonable facsimile' and even to deceive by means of it. This title on the Pierpont Morgan copy is known to be a facsimile, and was admitted to be a facsimile in the original Morgan Catalogue edited by Alfred W. Pollard. 34 It hardly takes an expert on paper to decide that a Bartholomaeus title on wove paper is not so good as it ought to be. The answer is not quite so easy for a Bartholomaeus in the collection of Paul Mellon. The copy is handsome and its titlepage appears acceptable, but the paper proves otherwise. For the paper has a chain-rhythm reminiscent of the close chains accompanying the Wheel mark but not of the broader spaces beyond. A person not conversant with this Italianate chain-pattern might spot the fault, but it helps to have made some slight study of the Tate product. Whether or not the facsimilist intended to deceive, he took advantage of the fact that the blackness of the woodcut would obscure the place of the watermark. But holding the leaf aslant to sunlight or lamplight, with the chains parallel with one's eyes, reveals the grooves and the fact that a watermark is not there. A related example is furnished by the British Museum copy of the Lydgate folio Assembly of the Gods . I do not know that this book has ever before been listed among the Tate-paper books, though it comes as an appendage to the Canterbury Tales and thus on the same paper. This sameness of paper gives a date to an undated piece of printing: [1498]. But it also gives the lie, unhappily, to leaf 13. It is on paper with chainspaces similar in size to those in the Wheel watermark areas of the same Chaucer-and-Lydgate folio. Actually the facsimile is signed minutely by the expert and honest workman: 'F.s H.', that is Harris. The work is so good that it might deceive almost any bibliographer who pays little attention to paper. It did for instance Gordon Duff. 35 And now comes a small discovery with a problem attached. I have spent a number of unexciting hours ranging through the folios containing long long runs of the Wheels of John Tate. Recently I leafed through the British Museum copy of the Legenda aurea of 1498, holding each leaf to the light. Each sheet contained the expected Wheel, either from Mould U or from Mould E — until I came to M3, folio '286' in 'The lyf of saynt Edward kynge'. There came a surprise and a very acceptable one: a Tudor Rose! Once only in the book, for from that point again the Wheels roll on to folio '398'. It was the first time I had seen the Rose within a folio leaf, and here it was mainly limited to an intercolumn space of less than a quarter of an inch. The mark measures about 35|6[18|16.5]2|34 in right folio and is from Mould U. Shortly after, I ascertained that leaf M3 in the Cambridge and Oxford copies also contains the Rose, and again only that one leaf. The Cambridge Rose is E and the Bodleian Rose is U. If we might use a β-radiographic plate for taking pictures of these Roses, we would need to look no farther. For radiography ignores the obscuring type. But what may be the significance of the single Tudor Rose on leaf M3 of the Legenda ? Presumably it means a cancel or else a reprint to complete the edition-sheet. That is, Wynkyn de Worde found he had made a grievous error and so reprinted, or else he ran out of copies of sheet M3.6 and so reprinted. The leaves are conjunct. As the book is dated precisely 8 January 1498, this reprinting probably occurred in 1498 or 1499. There remained but five reasonably complete copies to investigate. With the kindly aid of the custodians of these copies, the votes have come in. The Pierpont Morgan copy has a Rose in M3. The Phillis &amp; John Gordan copy has a Rose in the conjunct M6. The John Rylands copy has a Rose in the same sheet. There is a Rose in the St David's College copy at M3. And also in the Golden Legend at Trinity College Cambridge. What monotony! Where is the assumed cancellatum ? But TCC reports also a Tudor Rose, not far away, in K6. There is always something further to investigate. Many years ago a copy of the Tate-de Worde Legenda was damaged in a fire and the remaining leaves were dispersed. The Newberry Library has nine of these leaves, including four with Wheel marks, and Dartmouth College Library has a similar fragment. 36 Even the writer of these pages has four leaves carefully selected to represent two pairs of Wheel watermarks. 37 Today Maggs Bros. still offer a leaf from this dismembered copy — and the price has risen to 5 guineas. The leaves are now scattered far and wide. Who, oh who, if anyone, owns leaf M3 or its conjunct? Some mute unsung bibliophile, some country college with a Rare Book Room containing but one leaf may hold the key to the mystery. . . . As the eight copies of the Legenda already examined all have the Rose leaf, chances seem to favor the cancel hypothesis. If so, whether or not the cancellatum has disappeared, the Rose paper should belong to 1498. If the leaf or sheet is a reprint in order to make up copies, it may belong to 1499 or later. The situation presents a pleasant possibility. As we know from the Household book of Henry VII, he was at Hertford Castle on 23 May 1498 and on the 25th he saw the papermill. The entry reads: For a rewarde geven at the Paper Mylne, 16 s 8 d The interesting thing is that a similar entry occurs in the following year: Geven a rewarde to Tate of the Mylne, 6 s 8 d 38 What is the meaning of the additional reward? Apparently the King did not revisit the mill. I suggest that after the visit of May 1498 Tate's Italian workman fashioned new moulds emblazoned with the royal symbol and that at Westminster (say) John Tate presented to Henry VII a supply of writing paper marked with Tudor Roses.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The elder John Tate was Mayor in 1473 and died in 1478 or early 1479. His relative Sir John Tate was Mayor in 1496 and died in 1514, and he also had a son John. The situation has confused Blades, Clapperton, and others. But clearly the first John Tate was the father of the paper-maker. The latter is called 'John Tate the younger' in family documents. He died in 1507, he was buried at St Dunstan's in the East, and his will was probated in 1508. See John Stow: A Survey of London , ed. Charles L.

Heawood's example in a Paston Letter appears to be a ghost. His reason for not including this important English mark in Watermarks (Hilversum 1950) may have been that he had the mark from a correspondent in the first place. But he might have published Beazeley's honest tracing. John Fenn does reproduce the Tate mark in Original Letters , II (1787), pl. XIII, to illustrate his preface but not from a Paston letter. Letters of 1494-96 do not have the mark. 4 Alfred H. Shorter: Paper Mills and Paper Makers in England 1495-1800 (Hilversum 1957), p. 174 and figs. 1-3. 5 When I wrote my friend E. J. Labarre in high protest, he replied only: 'I thought you would not like that!' As Dr Shorter was mainly interested in the mills, the perverse treatment of the watermarks was mainly Labarre's. Although the collections of the Paper Publications Society prove very useful to the scholar, often the tracings provide only a starting point for bibliographical research. 6 Rhys Jenkins: 'Paper-Making in England, 1495-1788', The Collected Papers (1936), p. 157.

For instance, Clapperton's Modern Paper-Making , 3d ed. (1952), p. 2, places the mill at Stevenage despite the fact that the author had already convinced himself in Paper: An Historical Account (1934), p. 106, that it really was at Hertford. Thus the error goes on in Colin Clair: A History of Printing in Britain (1965), pp. 2, 29. The mill was on the River Bean outside Hertford near the road to Stevenage. 10 Briquet thought of twin marks as ' variétés identiques ': Les Filigranes , I xix, 17, and thus not something to reproduce. For a basic study see Allan Stevenson: 'Watermarks Are Twins', Studies in Bibliography , IV (1951-52), 57-91, 235, which includes an earlier discussion of Tate's Wheel mark; also application of the method in The Problem of the Missale speciale (Bibliographical Society 1966). 11 Duff 40, 408, 90, 253; STC 1536, 24876, 5085, 17005. 12 For the Gallizians and the Klingenthal Mill see The Problem of the Missale speciale , ch.

I am grateful to Dr H. K. Prescot of the College Library for aid and information. 20 The collection is far stronger than Briquet plus Heawood in Norman Unicorn, Hand, and Pot marks of the fifteenth century. Unfortunately many of the tracings look too faint for further reproduction. 21 Though long used in France, the term Bastard (as a paper size) is not known in English documents before Thomas Berthelet's bill of 1541-3 rendered to Henry VIII largely for printing proclamations.

It transpires that a 'Tudor' Rose, perhaps the twin of Briquet's example, occurs in the unique Caxton Psalterium (Duff 354, Blades 38) at the British Museum, the two quarto sheets of gathering i. As the mark is space-centered, whereas Br 6628 after much use has slipped left to the chain, the date of the Psalterium may be 1483 or 1484. As the paper of the book is otherwise Italian, this intrusive Norman paper strongly suggests a cancel. Innocently I ask: How did the Norman papermaker (perhaps at Fervacques south of Lisieux) know that Henry Tudor would come to the English throne in 1485? 27 As noted by Heawood.

Not yet in 1506 was there a true Demy or Medium paper such as the eighteenth century had for printing octavos and duodecimos. Then came the fashion of printing and sewing duodecimos in halfsheets. Presumably in the early sixteenth century it was considered easier to sew in fours and eights than in twelves. 32 See note 21. 33 A tranchefile is an extra chain placed near the mould end to help the deckle restrain the pulp, and also its impression in the paper. This transchefile impression is useful for estimating the original length of a cut sheet. 34 Catalogue of . . . Early Printed Books . . . Now Forming a Portion of the Library of J.

      <field name="heading_text">The Printers and The Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647, Section 2 by Robert K. Turner, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Introduction From the textual scholar's point of view, the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647 is in some ways as interesting a book as its more famous predecessor, the Shakespeare Folio. In it Humphrey Moseley, the publisher, gathered, in addition to Beaumont's Masque of the Inner Temple , his verse letter to Ben Jonson, and a suitably copious amount of preliminary material, thirty-three "Beaumont and Fletcher" plays previously unprinted. The book thus preserves the copy-texts of most of the works in the Beaumont and Fletcher canon. Of a different order of interest is the fact that Moseley, evidently to speed production, had the volume manufactured in sections, bibliographically independent for the most part, by perhaps as many as seven different printers, the shares of five of which have been identified. 1 Because within its covers the bibliographer sees eight moreor-less separate books, the Folio is an ideal ground for a comparison of the methods adopted in several contemporary houses for the printing of similar material in the same format. This article reports the results of a study of the printing of Section 2, which, it is hoped, will lead to a more extensive investigation of the work of the other printers who contributed to the volume. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. Evidence All evidence was obtained from examination of two copies of the Folio, the one belonging to the library of the University of Wisconsin — Milwaukee (of unknown provenience, but purchased from Heffer, Cambridge, in 1952) and the one belonging to Dr. Cyrus Hoy (formerly the Fairfax of Cameron copy). 3 The kind of evidence used, the terminology adopted for it, the means contrived to display it, and the interpretations put on it have been influenced, as the reader will recognize, by Dr. Charlton Hinman's Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963), although there are some divergences from Hinman's methods chiefly because of technical differences between the Shakespeare and the Beaumont and Fletcher Folios. Yet the general similarities between these books and the kinds of evidence available from both are so strong that it has been possible to refer the reader often to Hinman's study, where he will find many matters relevant to this investigation discussed admirably and at length. It seemed convenient to work through the section quire-by-quire and page-by-page, considering in turn evidence relating to presswork, to the identity of compositors and the scope of their work, and to the method of composition they employed. The evidence used and the nature of the inference from it are governed by the relationship between the three distinct stages in the cyclical journey of pieces of type from the type cases into the formes (composition), through the press (presswork), and from the wrought-off formes into the cases again (distribution). Presswork Because information about presswork, specifically the order of the formes through the press, is relatively easy to obtain and is based on evidence that is the least controvertible, the analysis of each quire began with proof of the order of the formes, which was made on these grounds: 1. Evidence from the components of the skeleton-forme, such as running-titles and rules, and from center rules, taking into account the testimony of priority given by disfigurations, dislocations, and other peculiarities . 4 It was assumed, in the absence of indications to the contrary, that two skeleton-formes would have been used alternately. 2. Evidence from type matter reappearing within the quire . When a piece of type, a scene head, an ornament, or a rule not a part of the skeleton-forme appears twice within the same quire, it is apparent that one of the formes of the quire was printed and distributed (at least in part) before composition of the entire quire was completed. It was assumed, lacking contrary evidence, that two formes containing the same piece of type matter would not have been machined concurrently, for had they been, a delay in presswork would have resulted. 3. Evidence from embossing . The priority of the formes printing and perfecting a single sheet can be determined from the embossing of the inked paper by the type of the perfecting forme, 4a but because embossing resulted largely from the pressure exerted by the pressman's pull, there are nearly always differences in the degree of embossing in different examples of the same sheet. Because one of the copies of the Folio used for this study is not generally accessible, the evidence from embossing is not reported. It may be understood, however, that the implications of this kind of evidence as it appeared in the copies examined never contradicted the conclusions drawn from other evidence. The Order of Composition and Distribution It is reasonable to assume that a temporal relationship held between composition, presswork, and distribution — that, in general, the first forme set was the first forme machined and the first distributed. As soon as this is said, however, qualification must be made. If the press was temporarily out of commission, printing other material, or otherwise unavailable for work on the Folio, two or even more formes might be machined later in any convenient order. Yet when operation proceeded smoothly, "the order in which the various formes were printed was ordinarily the the same as that in which they were set." 5 Thus, to prove the order of printing is usually to prove the order of the composition of the formes. Such a firm relationship did not, however, exist between presswork and distribution, for if two wrought-off formes were available for distribution nothing seems to have compelled the compositor to distribute first the one that was machined first. 6 Once more, though, there was a tendency to distribute material in the order of its machining; and, regardless of its implications for priority, evidence of distribution indicates at least that composition and machining had taken place. Such evidence is, therefore, not irrelevant to problems of composition, although it has to be used circumspectly. Composition (in which term I include all the compositor's duties) seems, in fact, to have been governed by presswork. When the press stood idle, the printer could not profit; hence, when local conditions permitted it, an effort evidently was made so to regulate the speed of composition that the press would be supplied with a steady flow of material to be printed off. The rate of printing was chiefly a function of the size of the edition, and the rate of composition was chiefly a function of the nature and amount of the text to be set up for each forme. The speed of printing was a constant, but the speed of composition could be varied by several means, a favorite among them being the employment of more than one compositor to set type for a single forme or some other kind of collaboration to accomplish the same purpose, such as the composition by one workman of a complete forme while his companion set another forme or the employment of one workman in distributing and performing other chores while his companion set type. Flexibility was desirable, of course, and these basic techniques may have been modified in many different ways in order to adjust for the effect that particular circumstances had upon the progress of a specific printing job. However, because a folio forme contained a considerable amount of material and because a folio forme could be machined in about the same time as one containing much less (say a quarto forme) if the same number of copies of both were to be made, it seems generally true that two compositors were required to work simultaneously in folio printing. 7 When two compositors collaborated in setting a forme or some other subdivision of a quire, they would divide the work to be done according to a more-or-less rational scheme consistent, one supposes, with either the bibliographical structure of the book or the physical characteristics of the copy. The actual division could, of course, be affected by many things — the availability of workmen, their speed in composing relative to each other and relative to the speed of the press, their competence, and so on — and the rationality of the scheme adopted may have been more apparent at the time than it seems now. Nevertheless, the manner of dividing the copy is a factor that must be taken into account when there are indications that more than one compositor was at work. Proof of the order in which the pages of a particular quire were set can usually be made on the following evidence: 1. Reappearing types . As Hinman has shown in detail, it is possible to identify individual pieces of type which are distinctively broken, bent, or otherwise marked and to trace their reappearances in quire after quire. 8 There are, to be sure, differences in the reliability of the identifications. Some types are battered in so readily discernible a way that they can be recognized with no difficulty. Others, however, are so deformed that the characteristic which makes them distinctive can be obscured by variations in inking, in the surface of the paper, or in the force of the impression. Still others are virtually worthless as evidence because either through accident or through some weakness inherent in the design of the letter two or more types will have been damaged in such a way as to make them practically indistinguishable; the ascenders of d's and the descenders of p's, for instance, were very often bent or broken in almost exactly the same way. Sometimes a letter which can be recognized in one copy of the Folio cannot be recognized in another, and sometimes a pattern of recurrences will indicate that a type must have been used on a certain page on which it cannot be found. 9 Furthermore, a compositor was rarely obliged to use again immediately any type which was returned to his case; he may not have needed it, or it may have become temporarily unavailable by being put accidentally in an out-of-the-way place or simply by sifting down into the box. Thus some types, as it were, go underground for several, sometimes many, quires. On the whole, however, types were reused regularly; and, when recognized, they provide very solid bibliographical evidence, although the reliability of this evidence decreases, as will be seen, the smaller the number of types giving testimony. To find in Quire Y a type which had earlier appeared in Quire X is generally to find that the part of Quire X containing the type had been distributed in the ordinary way. But this conclusion is not always correct, for some types moved into new positions not as a result of distribution but as a consequence of an accident or irregularity, having been pulled during inking, separated from other types when the skeleton was stripped from the wrought-off forme or the center rule removed, or dropped during distribution. 10 If one finds ten types from X3a in Y4b, it is clear that X3a was distributed before the Y-column was set and that Y4b was composed at the case 11 into which X3a type was distributed, if the column rather than the part-column was the unit of distribution. If, however, one finds one type from X3a in Y4b, these matters are by no means so clear; the one X3a type may be aberrant, having made its way into the case from which Y4b was set through accident rather than regular distribution, or it may be quite genuine, being merely the only recognizable type from X3a that happens to appear in Y4b. Thus when recognizable types are few, it is necessary to use the evidence they provide with caution, and, if possible, to confirm it by evaluating its consistency with other evidence. Nevertheless, in spite of minor ambiguities, distribution is usually not hard to prove, and it then follows that "whenever a number of types are distributed into a certain case these types will necessarily next be used in material set from that case." 12 Evidence of case in conjunction with spelling evidence, as Hinman has shown, is of major importance in establishing the limits of a compositor's work in a particular forme, the identity of the workman, and the relationship borne by composition to presswork at any particular time. 13 Whether type drawn from one case was distributed into the same case by the man who set it is a matter of some consequence. What little information there is about this aspect of Elizabethan printing practice indicates that sometimes, perhaps generally, compositors may be said to have "owned" their types, so that if Compositor A set X3a from a certain case, the reappearance of X3a type on Y4b will indicate that Compositor A set that column as well from the same case. 14 In William Wilson's section of the Folio, however, this practice was not followed with any consistency; hence, the concept of case as a category of bibliographical evidence is severely restricted. It is not, however, invalidated. If one observes that X3a type reappears in Y4b, Y4 v a, and Y4 v b, it is evident that the three Y-columns were set from the same case regardless of which compositor set or distributed X3a. But it does become necessary when there is a likelihood of one workman distributing another's type to distinguish between the testimony of types which reappear immediately and those which do not — which are, so to speak, latent — the former being much more trustworthy as evidence than the latter. Suppose that a type found in Y4b was last seen in W2a, a column known to have been distributed during the composition of Quire X into Compositor B's case. The implication would be that the Y4b type in question was not used in Quire X and that its appearance on Y4b is evidence for the setting of that column by Compositor B. It is always possible, however, that the type actually was used in Quire X but was unobserved there, and if it happened to be used in an X-column that was distributed into Compositor A's case, its appearance on Y4b means that that column was set by A, not B. The special treatment accorded latent types (discussed more fully below) is thus a protective measure adopted to guard against one's inability always to see or to recognize the types being used as evidence. The chief value of latent types lies in the confirmation they can lend to the implications of other evidence. 2. Reappearing rules, display types, heads, and other typographical matter not a part of the skeleton forme . In the Shakespeare Folio it was found that center rules were associated "with the type-page proper and with the types used to set it. In fact they were treated very much as if they were themselves only types belonging to a special 'sort' . . . ." 15 In Wilson's section of the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio, it seems that center rules were, in general, handled not as types but as components of the skeleton-forme, which, of course, they actually are not. This difference perhaps arises from the fact that in Jaggard's shop the page was usually the unit of distribution and in Wilson's the column, but the point is that in Wilson's work the center rules cannot be used to prove the identity of the compositor, nor can other miscellaneous typographical matter not a part of the skeleton forme. Initials, act and scene heads kept standing, short rules inserted horizontally to set off heads, ornaments, and display types seem to have been returned after use to a central location from which any workman could draw them subsequently. Thus the reappearance in Y4b of, for instance, a short rule previously observed on X3a, Compositor A's work, does not mean that Compositor A set Y4b; it means only that X3a was off the press at the time Y4b was set. 3. Type shortages . Because double-column folio formes contained a relatively large amount of type and because the repetition of proper names or abbreviations of them demanded the same letter again and again, type shortages sometimes occurred, particularly in the italics used for speech-prefixes and stage-directions. These shortages caused the compositors to substitute letter of a different sort, usually roman for the customary italic, so that a speech-prefix for the character Zenocia in The Custome of the Countrey , for example, sometimes appears as Zen . rather than as Zen . Deliberate substitutions of this kind can be distinguished from errors arising from such causes as foul case by the frequency and consistency of the occurrence of the wrong-font letter. It seems reasonable to suppose that, in general, the compositor would use up his supply of regular type before he would begin to substitute and would continue to substitute until his supply of regular type was renewed by the distribution of a wrought-off forme containing type of the required sort. On this supposition inferences can be made about the priority of composition of certain columns or pages within a compositor's stint. But workmen apparently did not always wait until their regular supply was completely exhausted before they began to substitute, and perhaps they occasionally raided other cases or broke new supplies out of storage rather than obtaining types from distribution. Moreover, it appears sometimes that during distribution the boxes containing a depleted sort were deliberately fouled, a crude but efficacious answer to the shortage and one which creates the impression of deliberate substitution which did not take place. As a rule, the testimony of type shortages is reasonably reliable when the shortage first comes into being, but it tends to degenerate in worth beyond a quire or two. The Identity of Compositors The identity of compositors can be proved on the basis of their habitual and occasional preferences or lack of preferences in spelling, typography, punctuation, abbreviation, and so on, although the detection of these preferences can be complicated by several factors, among them the alteration of spelling to "justify" a full line of type, the adoption of non-preferential spellings for visual rhyme, and, most enigmatic of all, the influence of copy spellings on the compositor's normal habits. A high degree of consistency in spelling evidence seems, unfortunately, to be rare, and it is conceivable that two compositors in the same shop could have preferences so nearly alike that their work is for practical purposes indistinguishable. Yet very considerable aid and comfort in the solution of problems of identity is available from evidence of case and order, applied on the reasonable assumption that two compositors could not set simultanously from the same case. If one finds, for example, that Quire X was set from one case, it follows that it was set by one compositor, unless it can be shown by variation in spelling that he was relieved at the same case by another workman during the course of composition. If one finds that Quire X was machined in the order 2 v :3-2:3 v -1 v :4-1:4 v and that X1-2 v were set from one case and X3-4 v from another, it usually follows that two compositors were setting simultaneously, barring once again the chance that either man was relieved at his case. Even with the help thus provided, conflicts in spelling evidence occasionally create uncertainties; but by and large one finds that evidence of case and order accords with spelling evidence in such a way that the identity of the compositor is reasonably clear. 16</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. The Printer of Section 2 Because the presentation of evidence hinges on the procedure followed in the printing, it is convenient to turn first to a brief account of the work of William Wilson and of the special features of the part of the Folio for which he was responsible. Section 2 as originally planned was to contain five plays: The Custome of the Countrey (A1-D1 v , D1 v blank), The Noble Gentleman (D2-F3 v ), The Captaine (F4-K1 v , K1 v blank), Beggars Bush (K2-M4 v ), and The Coxcombe (N1-P4 v , P4 v blank). To these, however, The False One (Q1-S4 v , S4 v blank) was added very late in the printing of The Coxcombe , evidently after the prologue (P3 v ) and the epilogue (P4) of that play, which had been violently spaced out to fill up as much of the end of Quire P as possible, had been set, but soon enough for the same skeleton-formes as had been in use to be employed further. 17 An additional indication of the late assignment of The False One to Wilson is the presence on P4, the last page of The Coxcombe containing letterpress, of the catchword The Chances , this play being the first in Section 3. As for the preliminary sub-sections, A contains the title-page (A1), a blank (A1 v ), the players' dedication (A2-A2 v ), Shirley's address (A3-A3 v ), Moseley's address (A4-A4 v ); e (actually signed E ) short poems by Corbett, Jonson, and Herrick (e1) and a long one by Birkenhead (e1 v -e2 v ); and f poems by Powell (f1), Hills (f1 v ), Howe (f2), Palmer (f2 v ), Brome (f3), Harris (f3 v -f4 v ), and Harrington (f4 v ). Because the preliminary material was set, for the most part, from fonts different from those employed in printing the plays and because the skeletons in which it was imposed cannot be identified, it is excluded from further consideration. About the printer not much is known that is relevant. 18 Wilson was bound in 1618 and gained his freedom in 1626. For twenty years thereafter he worked as a journeyman, but in 1645 he won, along with the hand of Mary Okes, control of the shop previously run successfully by her former husband John and before John by his father Nicholas. During the earlier years of the history of this printing house, the number of presses had been restricted to one, as specified by orders of the Stationers' Company recorded under the dates of 9 May 1615 and 15 July 1623. 19 Even during the time of Nicholas Okes's temporary and rather unhappy partnership with John Norton, which seems to have lasted from 1628 to about 1636, a second press apparently was not put into operation. 20 Yet after he took over management of the shop, Wilson printed a great many titles in a relatively short span of years, a fact which suggests that he may have erected the second press which the 1668 survey of London printing houses credits to his step-son and successor Edward Okes. 21 Miller (p. 136) thinks it likely that he did so, but not until 1653, when he applied to the Company for a loan of £50. What historical information there is, then, suggests that Wilson was printing on only one press at the time he worked his part of the Folio, and the fact that his section was machined in two skeleton-formes and no more tends to bear this out. Moseley's entry of the Beaumont and Fletcher copies in September, 1646, and his dating of "The Stationer to the Readers" as 14 February, 1646, indicate that the 1647 of the Folio title-page is a calendar-year date and that publication took place shortly before or after 25 March 1647. The allusions to the printing of the volume in Moseley's address further suggest that the body of the volume was completed, or nearly so, by 14 February. Hence, "the bulk of the printing was done in the autumn and winter of 1646." 22 The year 1646 was a busy one for Wilson. The STC lists eighteen titles, including broadsides, which were issued from his press in that year, and there may have been more to which his name was not added. He completed Francis Hawkins' Youths Behavior by 5 October and the first edition of Thomas Fuller's Andronicus by 9 October, following this with a second edition evidently shortly thereafter, for it, like the first edition, is dated 1646. During the winter he must have been occupied with his part of Shirley's Poems of 1646, entered 31 October; his part of Sir George Buc's large Historie of the Life and Reigne of King Richard III , 1646 in some copies, 1647 in others, entered 12 October; and some minor work. 23 His compositors and his one press could not have been devoted exclusively to printing Folio material during this time, and thus one can understand the interruptions in the Folio printing indicated, as will be shown, by bibliographical evidence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. Presentation of Evidence The analysis of individual quires was based on evidence from several sources: 1. Skeleton-formes and center rules . Appendix A summarizes information about the components of the two skeleton-formes employed in Section 2, rules being identified by arbitrarily chosen arabic numerals and running-titles by arbitrarily chosen Roman numerals. The four rules which enclose the page are referred to as the "Top Box," the "Bottom Box," the "Left Box," and the "Right Box." The "Head Rule" separates the running-title from the text. "HT" means head-title; head-titles appear instead of running-titles on pages upon which plays commence, and they do not recur. Running-titles were, of course, reset for each new play, but because the The of the old title was usually retained, the numeral borne by the old describes the reset title as well. The listing is by formes, so that, considering forme A1:4 v , one sees indicated for page A1 Rule 1 as the Top Box, Rule 4 as the Bottom Box, Rule 5 as the Left Box, and so on; and for page A4 v Rule 7 as the Top Box, Rule 9 as the Bottom Box, Rule 10 as the Left Box, and so on. It was convenient to include a listing of center rules here, although they are not, properly speaking, parts of the skeleton-formes. 2. Identified types and rules . Although not included here, tables were prepared in which were listed by an identifying number all recurring types and rules not a part of the skeleton-forme (excluding center rules) and their locations by page, column, and line. A total of 562 types and 37 independent rules were found to recur, some as few as two times, some as many as eighteen — that is, in nearly every quire and sometimes twice within a single quire. 24 3. Graphs and supporting lists . For each quire of Section 2 except the first a graph was prepared to show the sources within the Folio of the recognizable types which reappear within the quire and consequently the case or cases from which various parts of the quire were set. The basic idea of such an array was Hinman's (as was the term "graph" to name it), but these graphs differ in a number of particulars from his because of several technical differences between Jaggard's and Wilson's work and because of the different formats of the two books, the Shakespeare Folio being in sixes and the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio in fours. The identity of the types and rules represented in each graph was indicated in a supporting list. The graph for Quire G is fairly typical and may serve as an example. Before it was prepared, the evidence relating to presswork was considered. Skeleton I imposed G2 v :3 and G1 v :4; Skeleton II imposed G2:3 v and G1:4 v . In Skeleton I Rule 10 bends left at 16.2 cm. (from the top) on G1 v and subsequently but not on G2 v , showing that G2 v :3 was machined before G1 v :4. In Skeleton II Rule 15 is turned on G1, Rule 17 bends left at 23.7 cm. on G1 and H1 but not on G2, Rule 18 bends slightly right at 2.9 cm. on G1 and H1 but not on G2 (from the left or top, as appropriate), all of which indicates that G2:3 v was run before G1:4 v . G1 and G3, as will be shown in a moment, have types in common. Thus the order of printing was probably: Skeleton: I II I II Forme: 2 v :3 2:3 v 1 v :4 1:4 v By this means an indication was obtained of the probable order of composition of the pages of the quire and hence a clue to the proper arrangement of the material to be included in the graph. Because the unit of distribution and sometimes of composition seems to have been the column, the graph was organized according to columns, the horizontal headings indicating columns of Quire G and the vertical headings indicating the sources, by columns, of the recognizable types found in Quire G. In the body of the graph one sees on line 5, for instance, that types previously observed in F3a are found in three columns of G — two in G3 v a, four in G3 v b, and two in G4a. Just which types these are is revealed in a supporting list, omitted here. Lines 1 through 19 of the graph for Quire G display what may be thought of as the primary typographical evidence, types from material undistributed when the composition of Quire G began. There are two exceptions. F3 v a and F3 v b (lines 1 and 2) were distributed before Quire F was completely composed; their types reappear in F1b, the last column of Compositor A's stint in that quire. That other types from these sources were found in Quire G is of considerable significance because of the assurance they provide that the parts of Quire G containing them were set from the same case as the part of Quire F already attributed to Compositor A. The fact that F3 v a and F3 v b were distributed before work started on Quire G is indicated by the notation (d). The linkage seen here between a part of Quire F and parts of Quire G operates on a slightly different basis throughout Quire G. F1 v types (lines 3 and 4) are found in conjunction with F3 v types in G3a but by themselves in G3b. The inference is clear, however, that G3b was set from the same case as F1b and G3a, the case into which F3 v and F1 v types were distributed. The conjunction of F1 v a types with F3 types (lines 5 and 6) in G3 v b and G4a shows that F3 was also distributed into this case and that G3 v b and G4a, and by extension G3 v a, were set from it. And so the linkage continues, the important point being that the types represented on the graph fall into two distinct clusters, the one incorporating types listed on lines 1 through 9 and testifying that G3, G3 v , G4, and G1 were set from one case (designated Case A because it was the case from which Compositor A set his part of Quire F and because, as shall be shown in a moment, these pages of G are characterized by Compositor A's spellings) and the other incorporating types listed on lines 10 through 19 and testifying that G2 v , G2, G1 v , and G4 v were set from another case (designated Case B). The clusters, however, are not entirely distinct: one F1 v b type (line 4) is found in G1 v a and one F1a type (line 7) is found in G4 v b. According to the graph, F1 v b and F1a were distributed into Case A but G1 v a and G4 v b were set from Case B, and these two types in theory have no business being where they are. Both are anomalous, having actually made their way into Case B through an accident or having apparently done so because of an error in identification, and they are not the only types represented that have gone astray. F4 v b (line 18) was, according to evidence to be discussed shortly, distributed before the setting of G1 v , but one of its types appears earlier, on G2a, in the right cluster but at the wrong time. Similarly, G3a (line 19) was apparently not distributed until after the composition of Quire H was underway, but one of its types appears in G4 v a. Such anomalies, as it has been pointed out, are more the rule than the exception, and since many are inexplicable no special effort was made to account for them. The chance of one's being thrown off by their appearance is always present but usually of little concern, for, as is the case in Quire G, the numerical weight of the evidence forces a certain conclusion, and anomalies can be recognized as such by their small number and their lack of accord. Small numbers, however, do not always signify stray types. There is only one F4b type to mark the distribution of that column at G2b (line 16), yet here, because F4a was clearly distributed at this point, the inference is that the single F4b type gives quite genuine testimony of distribution. The order in which the columns of Quire G are listed at the head of the graph is the order of composition from each case as indicated by the order of printing and the order of distribution. It is to the second of these matters that the numerals entered in each line to the right of the distributed-column designation have relevance. A "1" indicates that the particular column was a part of the first forme of its quire to be machined, a "2" that it was a part of the second forme, and so on. One sees that all the columns of Quire F distributed into Case A were distributed in the order of their machining and this is the usual expectation; however, the distributions made into Case B were not so regular. First comes a previously undistributed column of Quire E (E1b, line 10), then a page of the first forme of Quire F (F2a, line 11, and F2b, line 12), but then a page of the third forme of Quire F (F2 v , lines 13 and 14) before a page of the second (F4, lines 15 and 16). As has been noted, this is not very unusual, for the compositor would have been under no compulsion to distribute F4 before F2 v provided that both were equally available, and sometimes, perhaps because the later material contained certain sorts which he needed, it may have been to his advantage to reverse the usual order. In this instance, one supposes that F2 v was first distributed because it was a full page and the compositor was about to set a full page, G2, and the distribution of F4 followed because it was a part page. The only occasions upon which such irregularities in the order of distribution become of more than casual interest are those which signal a delay in composition or an error in one's idea of the order of composition as indicated by the order of printing, as would be the case if type from the fourth forme of Quire F appeared in what one supposed to be the first column of Quire G to be set. Anomalous types also serve in this way as indicators. However aberrant it may be, the one F4 v b type on G2a, if correctly identified, would indicate a delay in composition if other evidence showed G2a to be the first rather than the third column of Quire G to be set from Case B. Because latent types are less reliable than the others, they are treated as secondary evidence and given separate listing. Lines 20 through 22 show latent types previously found in material known to have been distributed into Case A, and lines 23 through 26 latent types previously found in material known to have been distributed into Case B (hence the "A" and "B" designations to the right of the indications of source). When convenient, pages rather than columns are given as sources; thus on line 20 types from E2a and E2b are listed, because both of these columns were distributed into Case A during the composition of Quire F. There are in Quire G fewer anomalies among the latent types than were often encountered — only two, in fact. The two E1 v (A) types which appear on G2 should not be there, as other evidence shows G2 to have been set from Case B. They probably do appear on G2 aberrantly because they were used in F2 v , a page set from Case A but distributed into Case B, where they escaped notice. Failure to find types which were passed from one case to the other is the probable cause of most anomalies among the latents in Section 2 (that is, they are not actually latent in that they have lain unused during at least one quire's composition, but only seem so). Because proper identification of the immediate source of all types used as evidence is important, latents originating more than two quires earlier than the quire under consideration were not listed. Thus types noticed first in Quires A, B, C, or D which reappear in G are not shown on the graph. The reappearance of rules and act and scene heads has a bearing on the time of distribution, but because they do not seem to be related to case they are not noted among the latent types. None, in any event, reappears in Quire G. 4. Spelling charts . By "spelling" is meant not only the usual sense of the term but all characteristics, including such features as abbreviations, spacing, and so on, which serve to distinguish the work of one compositor from that of another. A spelling chart was prepared for each quire and was represented with the graph for the same quire. A basic list of variants was tested throughout Section 2; the absence from any chart of one of these forms indicates that it does not occur in the quire. The basic variants are A Forms B Forms Remarks again agen "againe" not distinctive — bin "been (e)" not distinctive heart(ily) hart(ily) B tolerates "heart" hour(e) hower/howre B tolerates "hour(e)" money mony B tolerates "money" near(e) neer(e) A tolerates "neere" and B has only slight preference murther — "murder" not distinctive only onely — peice/peece "piece" not distinctive — pre'thee "prethee" not distinctive — stirr "stir(re)" not distinctive sweet sweete B tolerates "sweet" warre warr A Forms B Forms Remarks short-form contractions long-form contractions e.g., "wee'l", "we'll", "we'le", "hee'l", "he'l", "shee'l', etc as against "weele", "weel'e", "weell", "shee'll", etc. Chart rubrics "short pro." and "long pro." periods lacking after numerals preceding nouns periods used e.g., "2 Merchant" as against "2. Merchant." Stage directions and speech-prefixes only; not distinctive in text. Chart rubrics "2 noun" and "2. noun" ("2" indicating any numeral). A tolerates "2. noun." S.D.'s with internal periods e.g., Enter Cozen . his Wife . [E3 v b]. Normal stage directions not distinctive. Chart rubric "odd s.d." In addition, there are a few variants in nearly every play which are peculiar to that play alone. They are In The Custome of the Countrey : Manuel Mannuel(l) Duart Duarte Arn. Ar. speech-prefix In The Noble Gentleman : Cous. Co. speech-prefix Duch. Dutch. speech-prefix In The Captaine : Fath. Fa. speech-prefix scene heads scene heads i.e., with reference to the set close set open amount of white space above and below the head In Beggars Bush : Florez Floriz Hemskirk(e) Hemskir(i)ck In The False One : Ægypt Egypt In the case of some variants, particularly speech-prefixes and stage-directions, the number of occurrences does not matter, and the fact of occurrence was indicated on charts only by "x." Spellings which occur in full lines are marked with an asterisk; such a notation as "3**" means that two of the three spellings recorded were found in full lines. As the listing indicates, two more-or-less distinct patterns were discerned. The validity of these patterns will be discussed under "Conclusions"; it need be remarked here only that the function of the spelling charts is to permit identification of the compositors working at the cases previously indicated by typographical evidence. Returning to Quire G, one may compare the graph with the spelling chart to see that B-forms cluster in the pages set from Case B and the A-forms cluster, somewhat less neatly, in those set from Case A, leading to the conclusion that Compositor B set the former and Compositor A the latter. 5. Tables of substituted types . In most quires substitutions were made for certain types whose numbers were unequal to the demands of the material being composed. As has been mentioned, substitutions do not always provide very reliable evidence, but sometimes their testimony allows one to adjust or confirm inferences drawn from other evidence. In Quire G, F's were substituted for F 's (because many F 's were needed for the speech-prefixes of Franke , Father , Fabricio , and Fredericke ) and VV's for W's. It happens that the shortages occurred only in the material set by Compositor A, in the following pattern, in which the numbers in brackets represent the types returned to the case by distribution. No attempt is made here to show the order in the column in which one finds the regular and the substituted type: Distributed: [F1 v ] [F3] [F1] [G3b] G3a G3b G3 v a G3 v b G4a G4b G1a G1b F /F: [0] 7/0 10/0 [1] 7/0 6/2 1/19 [0] 1/16 0/5 [10] 8/1 W/VV: [11] 9/0 8/0 [11] 9/0 — 9/0 [3] 4/6 3/7 [8] 3/0 Evidently A's case contained only slightly more than thirty F 's; these were steadily used until at G3 v b the substitution of F in speech-prefixes commenced, a few F 's being held in reserve for such special uses as the composition of a stage-direction in G4a and a song in G4a and G4b. Because only one F was returned to the case by the distribution of the type of Quire F, the supply remained low until it was replenished at G1b by the distribution of G3b. To the W's in Compositor A's case when the composition of Quire G began, the distribution of F-formes added twenty-five pieces during the composition of G3, G3 v , and G4a, but thirty-nine were used by the point at mid-G4b where VV's were introduced. The substituted character was used through G4b and to a point near the foot of G1a, where three W's seem to have been discovered or obtained from G3b, which provided enough of this letter to complete G1b without further substitution. Evidence from substitutions, as far as it goes, thus supports the conclusions previously drawn about the composition of Quire G, which may be summarized as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. Conclusions Quire G was selected for discussion here in part because it illustrates how the evidence reveals variations on what was actually the fundamental method of composition. When unencumbered by special circumstances, the compositors seem to have divided the work evenly as they did in Quire G, but while one set 2 v -2-1 v -1, in that order, the other set 3-3 v -4-4 v , in that order, thus producing the formes in the order 2 v :3-2:3 v :4-1:4 v . This routine technique may be seen, for example, in the graph and spelling chart for Quire H. ("H" and "R" here represent recurring heads and rules.) One notable feature of this array is the proof it gives of the value of the typographical evidence. On the basis of spellings alone, it would seem that H3a had been set by Compositor A, but the clear indication that the column was composed at Case B shows that it was probably set by Compositor B, even though none of his preferred spellings is found there. It also may be noted that heads and non-skeleton rules were not treated like types; B used a head that previously appeared in material distributed into A's case, and he removed rules from G4 v a for reemployment in H3 v a before he distributed G4 v type. The normal method of composition illustrated in Quire H did not emerge until Quire C, and after that it was often modified either to gain some fairly obvious technical advantages or in response, presumably, to some more obscure exigency. Quires A and B were divided in a rather complicated fashion to which the nature of the copy, the commitment of the compositors to other work, or both may have given rise. In Quire D, 1 v :4 seems to have been the first forme set to the press because D1 v is a blank, a fact which permitted the forme to be made ready for imposition with half the usual expenditure of effort; yet again the unusual nature of the copy for D1 (prologues and epilogues which probably occupied separate manuscript sheets) and Compositor B's assignment to some task other than typesetting (which involved him as long as the setting of E2 v :3) evidently had an effect. Similar causes seem to have affected the order of Quire F, in which F3 v is a short page, but it is not clear why the compositors, after collaborating on F2:3 v (if B set F2), found it convenient or necessary each to set a forme independently, unless the fact that The Captaine , another unit of copy, begins on F4 had something to do with it. Nor is it clear why they departed in Quire G from the usual sequence (which would have required Compositor A to set G4 v and Compositor B G1). It is usually true, however, that alterations in the basic technique of composition are associated with some peculiar feature of the copy to be got in the quire, as at Quires M and P, where short pages or blanks occur (M4 v and P3-4 v ). Here lies the limitation of the kind of evidence employed: although it commonly tells what happened, it cannot tell why; to seek the reasons for the bibliographical oddities revealed by the analysis, one must go to the text, changing his role from bibliographical analyst to textual critic. The evidence, however, is not always unequivocal. In a few instances, most notably in Quire N, it was impossible definitely to decide how the material was composed or by whom. One suspects that the pattern of type reappearances in these instances was disturbed by the intervening composition and distribution of non-Folio matter, but since the investigation did not range into Wilson's other books, it is impossible to say more on this point. In addition, while one of the compositors, A, had sufficiently pronounced preferences in spelling to permit identification of his work with tolerable certainty, the other, B, was less steady in his preferences, perhaps being more responsive to copy spellings. Although this characteristic helps sometimes to distinguish his work from A's, it more often makes identification difficult, and it creates the possibility that Compositor B was actually two men rather than one. No means was discovered, however, to show that a Compositor C occasionally had a hand in the material now attributed to Compositor B, and the evidence indicates, on the whole, that Section 2 was set up by no more than a pair of compositors, one of whom was somewhat erratic in his spelling. Of the two, Compositor A set substantially more type than B. The following scheme represents the order of printing and shows the compositors responsible for the various parts of Section 2. A notation like "B2a 1 " or "D1 1 " represents a part-column or part-page, the extent of which is indicated below the main listing; (b) represents a blank.</field>

A typescript of the entire study of this section has been deposited with University Microfilms, Inc., Ann Arbor, Michigan 48107, from whom xerographic copies may be obtained. 3 The UWM copy was brought to the U. S. by Dr. Hoy and obtained from him by the Library Associates of the University of Wisconsin — Milwaukee, to whom I am much obliged. To Dr. Hoy himself I owe thanks not only for lending me his own copy but also for patiently tolerating my keeping it a great deal longer than I had originally contracted to do. 4 Evidence of this kind has long been in use by bibliographers. Its particular applicability to the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio was noticed by Bald, op. cit. ; Guy A. Battle, "A Bibliographical Note From the Beaumont and Fletcher First Folio," Studies in Bibliography , I (1948-49), 187-188; and James S. Steck, ibid. , pp. 188-191. Steck observes (p. 188) that "the center rule cannot be considered an integral part of the skeleton forme," citing as proof the migration from forme to forme of center rules in Section 5, where they move independently of the box rules. For a more elaborate discussion of such evidence and its relevance to the Shakespeare Folio, see Hinman, I, 150-180. 4a See Kenneth Povey, "The Optical Identification of First Formes," Studies in Bibliography , XIII (1960), 189-190. 5 Hinman, I, 76 n. 1. 6 Cf. Hinman, I, 89 ff., esp. p. 98. 7 Presumably if the edition were very large and the press run consequently long, only one compositor would have been necessary. There is no reason to think, however, that many more copies of the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio would have been printed than of the Shakespeare Folio, for the composition of which two workmen at a time were necessary unless one was setting another job while the other set Folio matter (Hinman, II, 513-529). 8 Hinman, I, 52-150. The method of recording types on cards described by Hinman was used in this study as well. 9 As a rule, the reliability of type identification increases with the number of copies examined, and in this case only two copies of the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio were available. Both were scrutinized with care at least three times and some troublesome pages many more. I located and recorded the types that I could find in one copy; then I examined the other to confirm the identifications and to add more, checking these against the first copy; and finally my assistant, using either copy, confirmed all the identifications once again. Thus each type recorded was seen by two people, but I am confident that a third pair of eyes could see some types that were missed and would disagree with some identifications, though I hope not many. 10 See Hinman, I, 126-138, where the causes of anomalous reappearances are discussed under the heads Stripping Accident, Centre-rule Accident, Distribution Accident, Imposition Accident, Presswork Accident, and Types Used as Quads. 11 Actually the complex of cases. See Hinman, I, 108. 12 Hinman, I, 110. 13 See esp. the discussion ibid. , I, 108-126. 14 ". . . Whenever practicable, wrought-off material was distributed by the compositor who set it" but ". . . a compositor would ordinarily distribute pages which he had himself set before he distributed material set by someone else" (Hinman, I, 98 and 124). Thus Hinman is able to speak of Cases x, y, and z, out of which specific types proceeded and into which they returned. Retention of their own types seems also to have been the practice of the compositors of Albumazar Q1 (1615), described in Turner, "Reappearing Types as Bibliographical Evidence," Studies in Bibliography , XIX (1966), 198-209. 15 Hinman, I, 138, following which there is a useful discussion of the employment of center rules in printing and their value as bibliographical evidence. 16 Cf. Hinman, I, 180-226. 17 Bald (p. 30) denies that the The's of the running-titles of The Coxcombe carry over to The False One , but three of them do (see Appendix A, Quires P and Q particularly). I think that his remarks on the failure of act heads used earlier to reappear in The False One (p. 31) are also mistaken. 18 An account of his career is given by C. William Miller, "A London Ornament Stock, 1598-1683," Studies in Bibliography , VII (1955), 136-138. 19 W. A.

      <field name="heading_text">Richardson's Revisions of Pamela by T. C. Duncan Eaves and Ben D. Kimpel</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since the publication of William Merritt Sale's Samuel Richardson A Bibliographical Record of His Literary Career with Historical Notes (1936), scholars have known that there were seven duodecimo editions and an octavo edition (1742) of Pamela and two duodecimo editions and an octavo edition of the continuation (Volumes III and IV) published during Richardson's lifetime. A duodecimo of both (1762), called the "eighth edition," appeared shortly after his death. Professor Sale determined that at least slight changes were made in the texts of most of these editions, but so far as we know, no one has carefully compared the texts to determine the extent of the revisions. We have recently discovered that Richardson's last and most elaborate revision of Pamela , long believed to have been lost, was actually published in 1801 and reprinted in 1810. In connection with this and with our work on Richardson's biography, we have been led to make a textual study of the revisions of the novel. The nature of these revisions should help in determining which text is to be regarded as the best text. At present both the first (1741) and the last (1801) versions are available only in the rare original editions. The only two editions of Pamela now in print are the Everyman Library edition, first published in 1914, and the Norton Library edition (of the first part only), first published in 1958. Neither states which text it is based on, and neither makes any claim to being a scholarly edition. The Norton text seems to be identical with such earlier texts as Sir Leslie Stephen's of 1883 and Ethel M. M. McKenna's of 1902, both of which appear to go back, directly or indirectly, to the Reverend Edward Mangin's of 1811. In most respects all of these texts resemble the duodecimo published a few months after Richardson's death: they even follow misprints in this edition. They do, however, contain some readings which are like those in the octavo (1742) and unlike the posthumous duodecimo (1762) and are, therefore, not exact reprints of any text for which Richardson is known to have been responsible. The Everyman text is in most respects identical with the Norton and with the earlier texts which it resembles, but it does have variants, at least some of which appear to be emendations introduced by whoever prepared the copy or by the compositor. The edition generally regarded as "standard" is that published by the Shakespeare Head Press in 1929. This is a handsomely prepared edition, but again makes no pretensions to being a scholarly one. It simply reprints the octavo text with the addition of the introductory matter from the third edition in duodecimo. But since Richardson made later revisions, it does not represent his last intention. In our opinion, there is no more convincing reason to regard it as standard than to regard the posthumous duodecimo edition, which the Norton and Everyman texts resemble, or, indeed, any of the other editions. In examining the revisions of Pamela printed before the 1801, we have read the octavo edition against the first and eighth editions in duodecimo and have then checked all changes against the other duodecimo editions. We have also read selected passages of the other duodecimos against the octavo — in the case of the seventh, the last published during Richardson's lifetime, our selected passages amounted to about a fourth of the whole. Since the selected passages disclosed only a handful of very minor variations (most certainly and all possibly misprints) which were not already disclosed by checking the differences between the octavo and the first and eighth duodecimos; since the revisions form a recognizable pattern; and since the pagination in all duodecimo editions is virtually the same (it may get a few lines off, especially in the fifth and eighth, to absorb changes, but soon gets back on again), it seems to us very unlikely that we have missed any variants of importance. In any case, the numbers of changes given below are merely meant to suggest the extent of revision. Since either an added paragraph or a "was" altered to "were" counts as one change, the numbers are of course only roughly indicative. We have not included obvious misprints, changes in italics, spelling, punctuation, capitalization, or paragraphing, or the expansion of contractions. Since Richardson was his own printer, there is some likelihood that his practice is reflected in these matters. They vary somewhat in all editions, and in some cases the variation is significant: there are more italicized words in the later editions; in the octavo and even more in the 1801 many contractions are expanded; paragraphs were broken up, especially in the second duodecimo and in the 1801. We have read the 1801 edition of the continuation of Pamela and have compared it with the octavo and the posthumous duodecimo, but we have not thought it necessary, in view of the slight intrinsic interest of this continuation, to make such a detailed comparison between the various editions as for the first part. In the 1801 edition the changes in the text of the second part are at least as extensive as those in the first. Many of them are cuts, which is certainly a gain. In this article we are considering the revisions only of the original Pamela , that is, of the first part or Volumes I and II. For textual matters we are referring to the editions concerned, as follows: 12mo means the duodecimo editions published during 1740-1761 (dated 1741-1762), the pagination of which is almost identical; 8vo means the octavo edition of 1742; 1801 means the revised edition of 1801; 1810 means the edition of that date.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">i The first edition of Pamela (dated 1741) was published by Charles Rivington and John Osborn on November 6, 1740, the second on February 14, 1741. 1 The latter had been announced in the Daily Post and the Daily Gazetteer as early as January 27. Aaron Hill had heard of it by January 6. 2 On December 22 Richardson had asked Hill's daughters for suggestions and corrections, and around this date he evidently told Hill that the style needed polishing. 3 He had also sent Hill a letter which an anonymous gentleman had written to Rivington on November 15, commenting in a friendly and complimentary way on the book, but making many suggestions for improvements. 4 The simplicity of the style had also called forth some adverse comment: "The Language is not altogether unexceptionable, but in several Places sinks below the Idea we are constrained to form of the Heroine who is supposed to write it." 5 But the author of the letter " To my worthy Friend , the Editor of PAMELA," printed at the beginning of the first edition of the novel (and also in the Weekly Miscellany for October 11, 1740), had demanded " Pamela as Pamela wrote it; in her own Words" — "in her neat Country Apparel"; and Hill also, for similar reasons, objected on December 29 to polishing. "I don't indeed pretend," Hill adds, "to have consider'd with a critical Exactness, whether twere an absolute Impossibility, by shortening here and there a Single Word or two, to draw perhaps the Energy a little, (very little) closer — without offering Profanation to y e native Sweetness of the Phrase, and Sentiment. But what a trite and insignificant Refinement, That! amidst a Mass of such unprecedented Beauties!" (Forster MS XVI, 1, fol. 37). Nevertheless Richardson did polish considerably for the second edition. There are 841 changes, and the vast majority of them are designed to elevate or correct the language. The past tense of "run" is changed from "run" to "ran" (often — Richardson hardly ever caught all his errors or changed them consistently), the past participle of "break" from "broke" to "broken," that of "write" from "wrote" to "written." The objective case of "who" becomes "whom"; "I sat out" becomes "I set out," while an intransitive "setting" becomes "sitting"; "you was" becomes "you were." In one place "look'd as silly" becomes "look'd . . . as sillily," only to be changed back to "silly" in the 1801 text (12mo, I, 67; 1801, I, 66), when Richardson's knowledge of grammar had advanced still further. Contractions are expanded, "infinitely" becomes "greatly" or is omitted, "said" frequently becomes "added," "says I" or "thinks I" becomes "said" or "thought," "my old Lady" becomes "my late Lady." Originally Pamela was "watched, and such-like, very narrowly," now she is "watched very narrowly"; Pamela would still rather "rot" than accept Mr. B.'s proposals, but it is "in a Dungeon" rather than "in a Dunghil" (12mo, I, 14, 16, 252). The style becomes less colorful when Mr. B. kisses Pamela "with frightful Eagerness" rather than "as if he would have eaten me" and when she tells Mrs. Jervis "all that had passed" rather than "every bit and crumb of the Matter" (12mo, I, 18, 22). In one place a misprint creeps in, "Coachyard" for "Court-yard," which is followed in all of the later duodecimo editions, though corrected in the octavo and in the 1801 (12mo, I, 111; 8vo, I, 140; 1801, I, 107). Most of the suggestions of the anonymous gentleman are not followed: Mr. B. does not become a baronet, though the objectionable word "'Squire" is frequently changed to "Gentleman" or "Mr. B." (and still more often changed in the eighth duodecimo and 1801 editions); but a long discussion in Volume III on Mr. B.'s accepting a baronetcy is probably an answer to the anonymous gentleman. Pamela's sufferings from Lady Davers are not shortened, nor does she show more spirit with that lady. Mr. B. still spans Pamela's waist with his hands (12mo, II, 216), as he continues to do throughout all editions, though, according to the anonymous gentleman, that "Expression is enough to ruin a Nation of Women" by tight-lacing. The word "naughty" generally stays, though it is occasionally changed to "wicked." Pamela does not discharge Mrs. Jewkes (this also is justified in Volume III). Pamela's superstitions about marriage on Thursday remain (12mo, II, 149). But "Curchee" is always changed to "Curt'sy" or some similar spelling, and "voluntierly" becomes "voluntarily." Pamela no longer drops down on her knees in a corner to bless God after her wedding (12mo, II, 177), and she no longer calls her husband "Master" through timidity (12mo, II, 197) — Richardson adopts almost the exact wording suggested by the anonymous gentleman, as he does also when he changes "my dear lordly Master" to "my dear Lord and Master" (12mo, II, 305). "Foolish thing that I am" was not altered — indeed it persists into the 1801 edition (12mo, II, 305; 1801, II, 238). But he does change two passages which, in the anonymous gentleman's opinion, were susceptible to interpretations as doubles entendres . 6 Aaron Hill on January 6 had opposed any changes at all, and had specifically opposed raising the style, giving Mr. B. a title, altering the scene with Lady Davers, dismissing Mrs. Jewkes, or changing the passage on Pamela's waist, the word "naughty," the phrase "foolish thing that I am," or the so-called doubles entendres . The only objection he had supported was that to the excessive prayers and appeals to the Deity — a "little Contraction" in these, he thought, might help to draw in minds "fashionably Averse to the Subject," to their own benefit (Forster MS XIII, 2, foll. 36-39, and Forster MS XVI, 1, fol. 39). Though this concession was retracted in Hill's letter of January 15, 7 Richardson considerably abridged Pamela's piety — 85 mentions of God were either cut or altered by changing the word "God" to "Heaven." Hill had mingled his advice with effusive praise and with some sarcastic remarks on the rash anonymous gentleman, and Richardson inserted his reply with several other letters of praise from him as an Introduction to the second edition. 8 It was this Introduction which was parodied in Shamela Andrews and attacked and ridiculed in Pamela Censured (London, 1741, pp. 15-19) and which called forth other uncomplimentary comments on Richardson's transparent puffery. One reverend gentleman wrote to John Osborn in February, 1741: ". . . you were bewitched to Print that bad stuff in the Introduction. . . . He [the writer of the letters] is too full of himself, and too gross in his Praises of the Author. . . . He [the author] wou'd do well to alter it, and make it shorter, besides, a Gentleman who seems to have intended well and honestly, is very ungratefully used, and it has given Offence" (Forster MS XVI, 1, fol. 46). The third edition appeared on March 12, 1741. It had 59 changes, none of them of much moment, but several of such a nature as to make it seem likely that they are by Richardson: "you was" to "you were," "let you and I" to "let you and me," "says" to "said," "broke" to "broken," "wrote" to "written," "run" to "ran." Two are certainly misprints, which were carried on into all subsequent duodecimos and the octavo: "desiring to interpose" for "desiring me to interpose" and "all my Scruples" for "all his Scruples" (12mo, II, 52, 126; 8vo, II, 25, 115). The first phrase was dropped and the second misprint corrected in the 1801 edition (II, 20, 86). The fourth edition, published on May 5, 1741, had 48 changes. 14 of them were in the Introduction, where Hill's remarks about the anonymous gentleman were considerably softened. On April 21 Hill had reluctantly given Richardson permission to substitute "unguarded" for "silly" as applied to Mr. Williams, in deference to the objections of certain clergymen (a change made in this edition) and to make other alterations in his letters in deference to the "sordid taste" of the age (Barbauld, I, 72-73). Earlier, on April 13, Hill had written that he had unwillingly made a few corrections on the proof of Richardson's "beautiful work," as Richardson had repeatedly urged ("a word, here and there") and would go on if Richardson insisted (Barbauld, I, 68-69). The few real changes in the text may, therefore, have been Hill's. The change of "lac'd Head, and Handkerchief" to "lac'd Cambrick Handkerchief" (12mo, II, 117) is almost certainly a deliberate change, as are "run" to "ran," "thinks" to "thought," and "how kind and how good he behav'd" to "how kindly he behav'd" (12mo, II, 24). Several of the others may well be misprints. The second major revision was that for the fifth edition, published on September 22, 1741. There are 950 changes, 45 of them retrenching redundancies and excessive praises in the introductory letters. Some of the other changes may have been suggested by Dr. Newton or Aaron Hill. 9 Most of the changes in the fifth edition are changes of phrasing, rather than grammatical changes or changes of single words, as in the second edition, the octavo, and the eighth duodecimo: "I must he and him him now; for he has lost his Dignity with me" to "May-be, I he and him him, too much: But it is his own Fault, if I do. For why did he lose all his Dignity with me?" (12mo, I, 17); "a Condition so much superior to what I could do for her" to "could raise her to" (12mo, II, 122); "as far as one Holiday will go; for that I can get Leave for" to "Leave to make, on such an Occasion" (12mo, I, 39). When Mr. B. looks through a keyhole and spys Pamela stretched out in one of her fits, the fifth edition adds that she was on her face (12mo, I, 31) — possibly to avoid what Pamela Censured (p. 31) called "a Posture that must naturally excite Passions of Desire" which could not be contemplated except "by one in his grand Climacteric without ever wishing to see one in the same Situation." The anonymous author of this pamphlet attacked Pamela for indecency and for its immoral tendency, but this appears to be the only objection which Richardson tried to obviate before his final revision. One nice touch is added when Pamela is trying her hand at hard work by scouring a pewter plate: "I see I could do't by Degrees; tho' I blister'd my Hand in two Places" becomes "It only blister'd my Hand in two Places" (12mo, I, 94). Richardson had evidently gone over his book carefully. There are two added passages of some length, on Pamela's reading (12mo, I, 143) and her proposed correspondence with Miss Darnford (12mo, II, 333). Pamela's verses on leaving Bedfordshire (12mo, I, 112-114) and the "Preface by the Editor" are extensively revised. And there are the usual grammatical changes: "without" (conj.) to "except," "who" to "whom," "broke" to "broken," "run" to "ran," "learns me" to "teaches me." On October 23, 1741, a French translation of Pamela was published in London. According to the preface (I, [x]), " Cette Traduction a été faite avec la participation de l'Auteur, qui a eu la bonté de nous fournir un petit Nombre d'Additions &amp; de Corrections. Et comme on aime à connoitre le Caractére de ceux dont il est fait mention dans un Livre qu'on lit, l'Auteur a bien voulu nous communiquer les Portraits de quelques personnes dont il parle dans cette Histoire. Ces Portraits n'ont point été inserez [sic] dans les cinq Editions qu'on a faites de l'Original, parce que l'Auteur s'en est avisé trop tard ." This translation had been advertised in the Daily Post as "in the Press" as early as March 27, 1741, and is based not on the fifth edition but on the earlier ones. It does not have the additions on Pamela's reading and her correspondence with Miss Darnford. Indeed it seems to be based on the second edition — "une coëfure &amp; un moucheoir" is previous to the "Cambrick Handkerchief" of the fourth edition (II, 138; 12mo, II, 117), and the French does not follow the third edition's misprint "my Scruples" (II, 148; 12mo, II, 126). In a few passages, however, it resembles the fifth edition: it adopts a change in the order of listing the various articles of clothing which Mr. B. gave Pamela (I, 14; 12mo, I, 12); the banks of the pond, "guilty" in the fourth and "perilous" in the fifth, are "dangereux" in the French (I, 173; 12mo, I, 231). "Il me laissa monter dans ma chambre" is like the fifth edition's "left me to go up to my Closet" rather than "I went up to my Closet" (II, 91-2; 12mo, II, 78). Pamela's parting verses, given not where they belong in other editions but later, are a very free translation, but seem more like the revised version. In many places where the French is like the fifth edition, the exigencies of French grammar probably forced a similar change. The translator substituted other words freely for "said" so that he often has a reading like the fifth or like the octavo, but he also has "écriai" or "reprit" where the fifth retains "said," so that these probably mean nothing. There are five to ten other passages where the French resembles the fifth edition and the octavo in ways which grammar probably does not account for, but all are minor and might be coincidental. There must really have been a " petit Nombre " of additions and corrections. The most striking addition, indeed the only very striking one, is the passage describing some fine ladies who come to see Pamela (I, 67-72) (" les Portraits de quelques personnes "). Aside from several variations of "said" and from one new paragraph break (II, 259), it is the only thing in the French translation which resembles the octavo and not the fifth edition. It may well have been written before the fifth was published and not adopted because it would have meant too great a change in pagination. This passage is also the most considerable change in the octavo, which was advertised as just published in the Daily Post of May 8, 1742. It was called the sixth edition and was issued with the third edition of Volumes III and IV, first published on December 7, 1741. In a letter to William Warburton of November 17, 1742, Richardson says that it "has received a good many Alterations from the former" (Forster MS XVI, 1, fol. 89). But these alterations are fewer in number (633) than those in the fifth edition, and only five of them are important: the fine ladies passage, the omission of the introductory letters and substitution of a detailed table of contents, 10 the omission of the conclusion (part of which was made superfluous by Volumes III and IV), a change in timing made necessary by the discovery that in the earlier editions two dates had overlapped (8vo, II, 233; 12mo, II, 222), and the inclusion in Volume I of several papers which had been in Volume II so that the break between the volumes occurs at a more crucial moment — Pamela's leaving the Lincolnshire house. Most of the other changes are of a single word: "kissed" to "saluted," "said" to "added," "replied," etc. (there are a great many of these), "durst" to "dared," "tho'" to "altho'," "naughty" to "wicked," "on" to "upon," "in" to "into." Grammatical changes continue: the past tense of "bid" is "bad" not "bid"; "where" becomes "whither," "there" "thither," "broke" "broken," "you was" "you were." Many unnecessary adjectives ("poor," "great," "all") are cut. The changes of the octavo were not followed in the sixth, seventh, and eighth duodecimo editions. It is perhaps not surprising that the more extensive ones were not, since they would have meant re-pagination, but it is hard to see why Richardson, who was his own printer and was meticulous where his own works were concerned, did not take the trouble to correct at least the grammatical mistakes he had discovered while preparing the octavo edition. Perhaps his work on Clarissa decreased his interest in Pamela for a while, or perhaps he had lost the copy on which he had marked his changes. When he came to revise for the edition published in 1801, however, he did use the octavo as a basis. The text of the octavo is usually regarded as the standard text of Pamela . Though its importance as a revision has been somewhat exaggerated, probably because of its splendid format and because the dropping of the introductory letters and the addition of the fine ladies passage have been known to scholars for some time, its use for the revision shows that Richardson did regard it as the best text available. The duodecimo edition of Pamela published in October, 1746, was also called the sixth edition. It had 26 changes from the fifth edition, and most of these are insignificant — 9 are changes of "farther" to "further." But even here the change of "it was me" to "it was I" (12mo, I, 234) was probably Richardson's, as well as the omission of the final "it" in "thou hast a Memory . . . that nothing escapes it" (12mo, II, 15) and of the "-ing" on "singing" in "My Master has just now been making me play upon the Spinnet, and singing to it" (12mo, II, 154). The first of these changes is not adopted in the 1801 edition, the second passage is reworded, and the third change is adopted (I, 256, 307; II, 112). One entry is changed from Wednesday to Thursday (12mo, II, 354), probably by oversight, since the next entry is also Thursday. The evidence about the publication of the seventh duodecimo edition is almost impossible to reconcile. A note in the Bodleian (MS. Don. c. 66, pp. 18-19) listing amounts Rivington owes Richardson shows that 300 copies of the duodecimo Pamela , Volumes I and II, were delivered to Rivington between December 3, 1746, and June 3, 1749; 144 more copies of these volumes (whether in octavo or duodecimo is not stated) were delivered up to January 18, 1753. On September 19, 1753, Richardson wrote to Mrs. Chapone that he had to send her a second-hand set of Pamela , "for the Fire I was afflicted with last Year, consumed all the First &amp; Second Vols. that were left in my Hands of the last Impression. But to make some Amends, they will be in the largest Edition; and with Cuts." (Forster MS XII, 2, fol. 89). Since he is sending her a copy in octavo "to make some Amends," he must have intended sending a duodecimo — that is, the sixth edition of 1746. But an advertisement in the back of Volume IV of Sir Charles Grandison , published in November, 1753, advertises Pamela in octavo and "in Four Volumes 12 mo. The Sixth Edition." Pamela in duodecimo is advertised in the Public Advertiser for March 19, 1754. This may refer to the sixth or to the seventh edition in duodecimo — Sale has discovered no advertisement of the seventh and its date of publication is uncertain. But the height of confusion is reached in Richardson's letter to Stinstra of November 26, 1755: "I have actually retouched Pamela: But there being a Number of the 3 d and 4 th Volumes of that Work in hand, more than of the 1 st and 2 d . I only printed as many of the two latter, as would make perfect Setts; and was therefore obliged to keep the two former as they were." 11 Since Stinstra is asking about Richardson's elaborate revision (the one ultimately published in 1801), it is hard to believe that Richardson is referring to the seventh duodecimo edition, with its few minor changes, as "retouched." The wording implies that Richardson had some Volumes I and II of the edition in question, though fewer than of Volumes III and IV. An unrecorded octavo seems out of the question, since the 1742 octavo was reissued as late as 1772. One possible explanation, somewhat less improbable than others that suggest themselves, is that Richardson discovered some unburned copies of the 1746 duodecimo, reissued them with some of his Volumes III and IV, and printed the seventh duodecimo edition to issue with the rest of the Volumes III and IV on hand (the "seventh" edition was published with the "fifth" of Volumes III and IV — a third issue of the second), and was deliberately obscure in his letter to Stinstra because his revision had bogged down or he was unsure what he was going to do with it. This seventh duodecimo edition is dated 1754 and has only 35 changes from the sixth duodecimo, over half of them of "farther" to "further," "ingrateful" to "ungrateful," or "an" (before "h") to "a." None of them can be said to be certainly by Richardson, though a "broken" for "broke" and an "if she please" for "if she pleases" sound like him. The readings of the seventh duodecimo are followed in the eighth. This edition (dated 1762) appeared three and a half months after Richardson's death, on October 28, 1761. Early in March, 1761, one of Richardson's daughters had written to Lady Bradshaigh: ". . . the four Vols. of Pamela being almost out of Print, and a new Edition called for, and being delighted to hear, that your Ladiship has remarked upon that Piece and Clarissa, he [Papa] directs me to express his earnest Wishes, that you will favour him with the Perusal of your Observations, with Liberty to add to new ones of his own such of your Ladiship's, as may make y e future Edition more perfect than otherwise it can be. The Employment will be, my Papa says, a great Amusement to him." 12 On March 13 Lady Bradshaigh wrote that she was sending the volumes so that Richardson could look over "what I have scroled in the Margin of your two Histories." 13 It is likely that the proposed "future Edition" was the one which appeared as the "eighth," and the nature of the revisions in this edition supports this view. There are 251 changes, 27 of them in the introductory letters (the praises are further toned down and considerable cuts are made) and 19 in the conclusion (there are two large cuts, one of them of material which Volumes III and IV had long ago made superfluous). The other changes are slight but follow a definite pattern; most of them deal with matters of propriety: gold trimming on clothes becomes silver (12mo, I, 82; II, 351); attendant servants are no longer mentioned (12mo, II, 354, 359). Mr. B. calls his steward Longman rather than Mr. Longman. Young ladies are no longer addressed or referred to as "Miss" alone. The word "Spouse" generally becomes "Master" or "Mr. B.," and more "'Squires" are removed. In the scene between Pamela and her former fellow-servants, their names are no longer enumerated (12mo, II, 345-346). The words "may-hap" and "Maiden" are fairly consistently changed. The elimination of superfluous elegance and the new words of address especially sound like Lady Bradshaigh. 14 If they are the result of her comments, they are Richardson's last literary activity. This does not mean, however, that some of the changes in the eighth duodecimo edition were not written earlier. Some of them are identical with changes in the 1801 edition. This may not always prove that Richardson used one revision to revise the other — "may-hap" and "Spouse," for instance, are also eliminated in the 1801 edition, but not always in the same way. If Richardson felt that such words were objectionable, the same result could easily have been obtained without comparison of the two revisions. "Bite" could have become "Trick" (1801, I, 65; 12mo, I, 66) and "take a Dinner" "dine" (1801, II, 285; 12mo, II, 355) in both texts without any comparison, but the number of such similarities, as well as a few where the similarity would be an unlikely coincidence ("when" for "while" [1801, II, 234; 12mo, II, 301] and "chose that Name" for "chose that" [1801, II, 290; 12mo, II, 362]), makes it seem likely that there was some influence of one on the other, though variations in other passages make it certain that one was not used as a basis for the other. A probable explanation would be that Richardson began to mark changes for a new duodecimo edition in the margin of the seventh while he was working on the more extensive revision, and at the same time used them in that revision, but that at the very end of his life he made further changes in the margin for a new duodecimo edition which were never incorporated in the revision published in 1801.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ii It has long been known that Richardson left a revised copy of Pamela to his family, which, it has been generally assumed, was somehow lost. The biography of Richardson in the Universal Magazine for February, 1786 (LXXVIII, 74), regrets that "the new edition, in which much was altered, and the whole new-modelled, has never been given to the public." In almost the same words John Nichols had expressed his regrets, adding that much is omitted in the "improved edition" and that only the fact that there was an edition unsold prevented its publication during Richardson's lifetime. 15 In the mid-1780's Mme. de Genlis was shown by Edward Bridgen, the husband of Richardson's daughter Martha, "un manuscrit du roman de Paméla, avec des corrections à la marge des propres mains de Richardson." Bridgen wanted her to translate it into French, "littéralement"; she felt she would have had to make many changes, and offered to have the translation done, but Bridgen refused. 16 This revision was the subject of considerable correspondence between Martha Bridgen and her unmarried sister, Anne Richardson, in 1784. 17 On June 28 Anne wrote approvingly of a proposal by Bridgen to have it published, but believed that "farther corrections" by Martha "wou'd be necessary and make it infinitely more perfect." She mentioned especially a "conversation at the farmer's" on Pamela's journey from Bedfordshire to Lincolnshire, which, to the best of her memory, she "thot. was not an improvement, as the stile is different from the rest of the two first vols." In answer, Martha on July 7 expressed her intention of going over them, "but, should I be prevented, I will request that the four Volumes may be destroyed." On July 10 Anne agreed "that unless they cou'd be re-revised" it would be better to destroy them; "they are still too imperfect for publication as having received my Father's last hand." She also mentioned that she had had for "some years" "the 4 vols: of Pamela, as altered," which Martha had lent her and which she did not return, since Martha "had another copy." On July 20 Martha asked for Anne's four volumes, "as I am now too poorly to bear the fatigue of perusing it in the blotted &amp; rough state in which our dear father left it, tho' I prize those Volumes which have received corrections from his own hand most highly. Perhaps I might make some further corrections in my own copy when I come to read it, which I should submit afterwards to your inspection. I know there are many scenes that I could have wished had been entirely omitted; but that I should think taking too great a liberty, &amp; altering the original plan too much; therefore all I should attempt would be to alter some particular phrases, &amp;c: at least this is my idea at present. I own I should be grieved to have the corrected copy destroyed, whether any use was made of it, or not, in our lifetime. Its having 'received my Father's last hand,' renders it precious; tho', at the same time, I earnestly wish he had been more liberal of his corrections." On July 31 Anne promised to try to send her copy: "The farther altering some triffling things wd. make it more perfect, tho' I think still it is not enough perfect to be published as having recd. our dear Father's last hand. — The alterations are not always improvements, tho' often so." On February 13, 1785, Martha Bridgen died. On April 12, 1792, Anne wrote to her niece Mrs. Moodie, daughter of Sarah Richardson Crowther: "As to the Pamela's, God only knows whether I shall have time or ability to go through them, and my handwriting is so bad, and even worse than ever, that I question whether if I am able to go through with the task, it will be of use." She expects no profits from any revisions of her father's works: "I remember that any recompence to the family was refused many years ago, when Mr. Bridgen proposed it; I have lately been told that my Father had promised to give them to the booksellers; and I always wished that m[y] dear Sister Bridgen, whose abilities were far beyond [mine, might] have consented to give them finished and re-corr[ected. As] I am very sure that my family wi[ll] never be able to obtain anything hereafter, I do not scruple to give them up now; and have only to wish that I was more capable than I am of doing Justice to them." It appears from this that Martha, who was considered to be the literary daughter, did not get around to re-revising Pamela . Nevertheless Anne did finally permit her father's revision, with or without further corrections by herself, to appear. On October 11, 1801, she wrote to Mrs. Moodie: "I had a letter the 22d of last month from my dear Nephew Sam 1 . [Crowther] with two setts of Pamela, the new edition, with my dear Father's last corrections. I am going over them very carefully, to correct errors of printing &amp;c." And there is a London edition of Pamela in four volumes dated 1801, prefaced by a note: The Booksellers think it necessary to acquaint the Public, that the numerous alterations in this Edition were made by the Author, and were left by him for publication. It cannot be material to state here the reasons why the Work has not sooner appeared in this altered and improved form. But it may be proper, for the satisfaction of the Public, to mention, that they have been favoured with the copy, from which this Edition is printed, by his only surviving daughter, Mrs. Anne Richardson. March 30, 1801. The title-page describes the edition as "A New Edition, Being the Fourteenth, with Numerous Corrections and Alterations." The only two copies we have located are in the British Museum and the University of California at Los Angeles Library. The text literally does have "Numerous Corrections and Alterations," and it is impossible to imagine anyone except Richardson who would have taken such great pains. In many instances Richardson's A Collection of the Moral and Instructive Sentiments, Maxims, Cautions, and Reflexions, Contained in the Histories of Pamela, Clarissa, and Sir Charles Grandison , published in 1755, agrees more closely in phraseology with the 1801 text than with the earlier texts and occasionally contains sentiments which are found only in the 1801 text. 18 It is possible that some of the minor changes are Anne's, but there is nothing in the 1801 text which seems unlike Richardson himself: many of the revisions are of the kind he had made in earlier editions; several added or rewritten scenes, including that at the farmer's to which Anne objected, are in the style of Sir Charles Grandison and appear to be beyond the abilities of Anne or even Martha. We do not see that there can be any doubt that the 1801 edition was printed from Richardson's revised copy, possibly with slight alterations by his daughter Anne. Anne Richardson had written Mrs. Moodie on October 11, 1801, that she was going over the new edition of Pamela "very carefully, to correct errors of printing &amp;c." She died in 1803. In 1810 almost the same group of booksellers brought out another edition of Pamela in four volumes, the "fifteenth." The only copy we have found is in the New York Public Library. Volumes I and II vary from the 1801 text in over 300 verbal readings, not counting the correction of several obvious misprints in the 1801 edition and a few changes which we have judged to be misprints in the 1810 text. The great majority of these variations are the alteration of "said" to another word or the omission of "said he" (or a similar phrase) or of "so." In one instance the mention of attendants is cut, and in another that of "silk" (1801, II, 25, 303; 1810, II, 23, 291). These changes are in line with Richardson's practice in the 1801 text. There are other changes which are at least due to careful reading and judicious correction. Most striking is the change of Pamela's reference (incorrect in all previous editions) from "Thursday the 20th day of my imprisonment" to "the 28th" (12mo, II, 25; 8vo, I, 397; 1801, I, 316; 1810, I, 302). A number of other readings, some of them like the octavo of 1742 and others new, seem to be improvements on the 1801 text. A list would be too lengthy for this article, but we will be glad to give further information to anyone with a technical interest in the text of Pamela . It is hard to imagine why a compositor, copy-reader, or bookseller would have bothered with all the "said's," or why anyone but Richardson's daughter would have gone to so much trouble. The probability, then, appears to be that the 1810 edition was printed from a copy of the 1801 corrected by Anne Richardson. It is not impossible that she consulted the copy in her father's hand, but none of the changes are beyond her own abilities. The date of the revision published in 1801 is uncertain. As early as November 17, 1742, a few months after the publication of the revised octavo edition, Richardson had written William Warburton that he was collecting "y e Observations and Castigations of several of my kind Friends in order, if the Piece should happen to come to a future Edition . . ., that it might be benefitted by their Remarks and that I might leave a corrected Copy for the Press" (Forster MS XVI, 1, fol. 89). But Richardson was constantly asking his friends and acquaintances to suggest corrections for his works. There is a more definite reference in a letter of October 5, 1753, to Lady Bradshaigh — Richardson proposes to "give Pamela my last Correction, if my Life be spared; that, as a Piece of Writing only, she may not appear, for her Situation, unworthy of her Younger Sisters." In a letter begun sometime before October 28 and finished on November 27 Lady Bradshaigh offered to read Pamela again after Richardson's "last correction"; looking over it some time ago she had noticed "several things that I have a notion you will think proper to alter" — she mentions especially the low style of the first letters. On December 8 Richardson expressed his hope that she would point out faults, though he defended the low style as proper to Pamela in her humble state. In a letter begun on December 23 and finished on January 14, 1754, Lady Bradshaigh promised that "when I want a piece of work I shall write my marginal notes, in an old edition of Pamela that I have by me." (Forster MS XI, foll. 31, 43, 49, 62) Earlier in 1753, on June 2, Richardson had written to Johannes Stinstra that he intended "to give my good Pamela, my last Hand. I find I shall correct it much; but shall have a particular Regard to preserve y e Simplicity of the Character." On May 23, 1754, Stinstra asked what had come of the intention and Richardson answered on June 28, "I shall retouch Pamela, as I have Opportunity; having gone a good way in it." In Edward Bridgen's will, an undated codicil directs that "the Copy of Pamela corrected by M r . R: 1758 8 vol: be sent to Mrs: Anne Richardson soon after my death." 19 From this it appears that the final revision was somehow dated 1758. Richardson had probably been working at it off and on since 1753, and may well have continued to "correct" the revision until his death in 1761. Judging by Anne's and Martha's letters, in 1784 there must have been two copies of the revision, one corrected in Richardson's own hand (which Martha had) and the other a cleaner copy (which Anne planned to return to Martha). The revisions are often far too extensive to have been written in the margin of a printed volume, but Richardson had used interleaved copies before, 20 and the copy in his hand (a very illegible hand by the 1750's) may have been a copy of the octavo of 1742 with marginalia and interleaving. Martha and Anne write as if each of the two copies was in four volumes; if they were, Bridgen in his will either meant to write "8vo:" or he was using the word "Copy" loosely to refer to the two copies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">iii All of the other revisions of Pamela are minor compared to that published in 1801, which has over 8400 changes in Volumes I and II, ranging from single words to whole pages cut or added. Hardly a paragraph is untouched — hardly a sentence, except in the first letters and in a few letters from low characters like old Mr. Andrews and John Arnold. The following paragraphs will illustrate the constant small changes, often insignificant, sometimes so insignificant as to be inexplicable. The octavo reads: Yes, said he, I would have you continue your Penmanship by all means; and I assure you, in the Mind I am in, I will not ask you for any after these; except any thing very extraordinary occurs. And, I have another thing to tell you, added he: That if you send for those from your Father, and let me read them, I may very probably give them all back again to you. And so I desire you will do it. (I, 401) In the 1801 edition this becomes: I would have you, said he, continue writing by all means; and I assure you, in the mind I am in, I will not ask you for any papers after these; except something very extraordinary happens. And if you send for those from your father, and let me read them, I may very probably give them all back again to you. I desire therefore that you will. (I, 319) In general, where the changes are not so great as to make comparison impossible, the 1801 text follows the octavo. There are a few passages where the 1801 has a reading from the duodecimos, or even a reading which appears only in the first edition; it is not impossible that Richardson did compare his various texts in making his more elaborate revision, but the passages in question are not numerous or striking enough to prove that they are not the result of coincidence. Many of the changes are similar to the ones made for editions published during Richardson's lifetime and for the duodecimo published shortly after his death. More contractions are expanded than in the octavo. Grammatical errors like "you was," presumably overlooked before, are now corrected. "If I was" frequently becomes "if I were." In a few cases, the 1801 text has a less grammatical reading: "it was I" becomes "it was me," "broken" goes back to "broke," "who do you think I have seen" becomes "whom" in the fifth and later editions but goes back to "who" in the 1801 (1801, II, 53; 8vo, II, 67; 12mo, II, 87). One would like to think that these readings are the result of Richardson's increased assurance with grammar and consequent increased boldness in departing from it for idiomatic effect, but they are not numerous enough to eliminate the possibility of carelessness or printer's error. Pamela's style is made more elegant by the alteration of perhaps vulgar but colorful idioms: "my Heart went pit-a-pat" becomes "my heart fluttered," "another-guise sort of Heart" becomes "a much lighter heart," "my Heart's turn'd into Butter" becomes "my heart's melted," " Madam'd me up strangely" becomes "calling me madam at every word" (1801, I, 26, 35, 88, 128; 8vo, I, 34, 45, 116, 168). Formerly Mrs. Jewkes "huff'd poor Mr. Williams all to-pieces"; now she "behaved very rudely" to him (1801, I, 147; 8vo, I, 182). Pamela is not allowed to hurry out "with a Flea in my Ear," nor does she describe herself as "as clean as a Penny" (1801, I, 52, II, 23; 8vo, I, 68, II, 30). "Body" in the sense of "person" becomes "girl" or "creature," "horrid cross" becomes "very cross," "crossish" "a little cross," "beholden" "obliged," "a deal" "a great deal," "I'll assure you" "I assure you." "Honesty" becomes "virtue" or "innocence"; "naughty," where it was left in the octavo, often becomes "wicked" or "foolish." "'Squire" is generally eliminated, though Goodman Andrews is still permitted to use the word. Pamela is no longer allowed to "sweat" so often; the word is changed to "toil." It is possible that a few of these elegancies were Anne Richardson's contribution, but most of them are so much like Richardson's practice in earlier revisions, especially for the second and fifth editions, that there can be little doubt the large majority of them were his. Most of Pamela's "well's" and "O's" were cut. So were a great many of her numerous "so's" and "dear's" and "poor's" — the last word often where it had no real meaning, but sometimes where it reminded the reader of Pamela's family background. The practice of finding variants for "said," begun in the second edition and especially common in the octavo, is continued, and the phrase "said he" or one of its variants is often dropped entirely, in line with Richardson's usage in the rapid-fire dialogue of Sir Charles Grandison . In view of these extensive changes in wording, it is surprising how much of the "neat Country Apparel" of Pamela's speech remains. Even in the first edition, Pamela's way of speaking becomes much more dignified once her master proposes to her. But in spite of the elimination of many homely words and phrases in the successive revisions, either Aaron Hill's advice or Richardson's good sense made him careful in tampering with her language before she is exalted, and a great deal of her simplicity persists in this final revision — fortunately, since the change in her language is largely responsible for the fact that even in the first edition Pamela almost dies as a character shortly before her marriage. In the 1801 edition she is still alive during the first volume. A great many references to God, left over from the first edition, are cut or are changed to "Heaven," and some of the kneeling and blessing is dropped (1801, II, 160, 267, 279, 280; 8vo, II, 226, 372, 388, 390). At the other end of the gamut, some "low" details like eating and drinking are dropped, as well as details of clothing. For example, when Mr. Andrews stops at the alehouse on the way to seek his daughter, no longer does he put on "a clean Shirt and Neckcloth," he puts on "fresh linen," and before setting out for Mr. B.'s he does not eat "some Bread and Cheese" and drink "a Can of Ale" (1801, II, 64; 8vo, II, 83). At the farmer's on her way to Mr. B.'s Lincolnshire estate Pamela is denied the glass of sack (1801, I, 128; 8vo, I, 168), and on the eve of her wedding Mr. B. does not over-persuade her to drink "Two Glasses" (1801, II, 116; 8vo, II, 154). "Poor Pamela's bundle" still contains the "four other shifts," but their description is dropped: "one the fellow to that I have on; another pretty good one, and the other two old fine ones, that will serve me to turn and wind with at home, for they are not worth leaving behind me" (1801, I, 93; 8vo, I, 122). In the first bedroom scene, Pamela is no longer about to say her prayers when her master rushes out of the closet, and though she still notices, in spite of her fright, that his morning gown is "a rich silk," she does not add that it is "silver" (1801, I, 72; 8vo, I, 95). It was probably Richardson's increased acquaintance with the world and with women like Miss Talbot and Lady Bradshaigh which led him to avoid such vulgar elegance as the over-use of "Gentleman" and "Lady" ("man" and "woman" are generally substituted) and to turn Lady Jones, Lady Arthur, and Lady Towers into Mrs. and Miss, which was certainly correct in the last two instances since "Lady" Arthur's husband was a mere "'Squire" and "Lady" Towers was unmarried. When in 1753 Lady Bradshaigh remarked on his "many mistakes . . . with regard to the Titles of several characters" in Clarissa and Pamela , Richardson replied that his "Ignorance of Proprietys of those Kinds, was one of the Causes." 21 He also gets rid of excess attendants (1801, II, 90; 8vo, II, 122), and his gentry no longer speak of "the Parson" or address each other as "Sister," "Aunt," or "Miss." Perhaps to prepare for Volume II, when all the characters become virtuous and polite, some of Pamela's harsh reflections on the refusal of Mr. B.'s Lincolnshire neighbors to help her are moderated (1801, I, 177, 185, 251; 8vo, I, 220, 230, 312). The name of Mr. B.'s Lincolnshire estate is expanded in Pamela's poem from "B—-n-hall" to "Brandon-hall" (1801, I, 186; 8vo, I, 231), perhaps in an effort to make readers forget about "Booby." One might have expected that Richardson would be especially sensitive about the criticism that certain of his scenes were inflaming. One would certainly expect that if Anne did any extensive revision her hand would have been especially heavy here. Victorian editions often bowdlerized Pamela . But there are comparatively few deletions in the "warm" scenes. Mr. B. puts his hand in Pamela's bosom only in the second bedroom scene (1801, I, 273; 8vo, I, 341) — his other mammary explorations are deleted (I, 29, 73, 251; 8vo, I, 37, 96, 311). Pamela's doubts as to what has happened to her during her fits are less stressed (1801, I, 74, 274; 8vo, I, 97, 342). Mr. B. no longer breathes "all quick and short" when he comes to Pamela's bedside (1801, I, 272; 8vo, I, 340). Two remarks in which Pamela jokes about her master's attempts are cut: "if I would not earn his Wages, why should I have them?" and "if I would not do the good Gentleman's Work, why should I take his Wages?" (1801, I, 48, 94; 8vo, I, 62, 124). Also gone is Mr. B.'s pun that he wishes he had her as " quick another way " as she is in repartee (1801, I, 82; 8vo, I, 107) — a remark which the author of Pamela Censured (p. 44) had said conveys "the most obscene Idea express'd by a double Entendre, which falls little short of the coarsest Ribaldry." Mr. B. does not joke about Pamela's watching men "dress and undress themselves" (1801, II, 89; 8vo, II, 121). Richardson may have been intentionally avoiding ambiguity when he dropped Pamela's remark about her sufferings between Mr. B. and his housekeeper (1801, I, 305; 8vo, I, 382), but it is unlikely that he dropped Mr. B.'s odd dream about the horses (1801, II, 157; 8vo, II, 222) because he foresaw what the Freudians would be able to do with it. Some of the moralizing passages are gone (for example, 1801, II, 86; 8vo, II, 115), but the greatest gain from cutting is in the scenes which consist largely of insipid compliment and fulsome praise of Pamela (1801, II, 59-62, 73, 305-7; 8vo, II, 75-79, 95, 423-26). Most of the cuts before Mr. B.'s decision to propose are compensated by additions, but in Volume II many scenes are considerably reduced — not, of course, considerably enough, since a love of having his characters praised was one of Richardson's besetting faults throughout his career. Several indirectly self-laudatory passages, where characters remark on Pamela's charming way of writing, are omitted (1801, I, 100, 309, II, 53, 76, 97; 8vo, I, 131, 387, II, 66-67, 100, 130-131). The longer additions are largely in the lively conversational style of Sir Charles Grandison . There are some good exchanges between Pamela and Mrs. Jewkes. When Pamela discusses with Mrs. Jewkes Mr. B's request to come to his Lincolnshire estate, the octavo reads: Why, may-be, said she, as he loves you so well, you may prevail upon him by your Prayers and Tears; and for that Reason, I should think, you'd better let him come down. Well, said I, I will write him a Letter, because he expects an Answer. . . . (I, 225) In the text of 1801 this is expanded: Who knows, said she, as he loves you so well, but you may move him in your favour by your prayers and tears? Prayers and tears you are a good one at, lambkin. — [Was she not an odious wretch? A woman! surely she cannot have the nature of a woman!] — And for that reason, continued she, I should think you had better let him come down. A good one at prayers and tears , Mrs. Jewkes! You are a wicked woman — (Jezebel, said she) — thus to make a jest of the calamity of a poor young creature, designed, as perhaps you know, for a sacrifice! She only laughed — Ugly creature! She only laughed — You cannot imagine how ugly she is when she laughs. — How must she look when she cries? I will write to him, continued I, because he expects an answer. . . . (I, 181-182) When Mrs. Jewkes offers to propose to Mr. B. that Pamela marry Mr. Williams, in the octavo Pamela said "of all Things, I did not love a Parson" (I, 235). In the text of 1801 both Pamela and Mrs. Jewkes say much more: . . . of all professions, I should not like a clergyman for my husband. She wonder'd at that, she said, as I had such a religious turn. — Why, Mrs. Jewkes, said I, my dislike of a clergyman proceeds not from disrespect to the function. Far otherwise. — Why, indeed, as you say, answered she [I did not say so] there are a great many fooleries among lovers, that would not so well become a starched band and cassock. E'fackins, thou hast well considered of the matter. And then she neighed , as I may say, if neighing be the laugh of a horse. I think I do hate her. Must not, my dear mother, this woman be a bad woman to the very core? She turns every thing into wickedness. She saw I was very angry, by my colouring at her, I suppose; but I said nothing. . . . (I, 189) Lady Davers's arrival is more vividly told (1801, II, 165-166; 8vo, II, 235-236), and her comments on Mr. B's letter to Pamela are lengthened and improved (1801, II, 184-187; 8vo, II, 257-260). A long passage, of which the following is only a little more than half, is added in which Pamela comments indignantly on a letter from Mr. B.: What cruel reproaches! Mean-spirited , and low , and forward : if I am low , I am not mean-spirited . I wish I could not say — It is he that, high as he thinks himself, is mean-spirited . — It is degree , not man , he says, that gives me apprehension. What can he mean by it? — A mirror of bashful modesty and unspotted innocence, he thought me ! What business has he to think of me at all? And so, because he thought me modest and innocent, he must seek to make me impudent and guilty. His dear mother, my good lady, did not, and would not to this day, have thought her favours misplaced , I dare say: but I know what she would have thought of him, for such vile doings to her poor servant-girl. In a manner grown up with me ! What an abasement does wickedness make pride submit to! Brought up with him ! How can he say so! Was he not abroad for some time? And when, of late, at home, how has he eyed me with scorn sometimes! How has the mean girl been ready to tremble under his disdainful eye! How have I sought for excuses to get from my lady, when he came to visit her in her apartment, tho' bid to stay, perhaps! — Brought up with him ! I say — Brought up with him ! He may as well say — The poor frighted pigeon brought up with the hawk! He has an eye like a hawk's, I am sure! and a heart, I verily think, as cruel! (I, 220-221) This addition will serve to illustrate the heightened style of the revision, as well as the way in which Richardson makes his heroine more sympathetic and less subservient. The longest addition, the development of the scene at the farmer's (1801, I, 128-138; 8vo, I, 168-171), is a good example of the sharp characterization, realistic presentation of manners, and accurate reporting of conversation which do so much to redeem Sir Charles Grandison and to account for Jane Austen's admiration for that book. A single paragraph can serve as illustration. Farmer Monkton (originally Norton) is going through Mr. B.'s letter to Pamela: Does he not tell us, Dorothy, in the letter he was so good as to write to us, that she will not own her love ? And will she own it? said the silly old man. — Well then; so far so good. And does he not say, that he has written to her to soothe her ? Very good of so great a man, I think: and that he has not told her the motive of his doings ? And does not this also come out to be true? And does he not say, that he will not come NERST her, that he may not give occasions for foul suspicions ? And does he not tell us what is the nature of headstrong girls ? Too well we know what that is, Dorothy. And then he frowningly looked upon his daughter, who cast her eyes down, and blushed. And does he not say, that this young gentlewoman here will be out of humour at her disappointment ? And do not the free things she have said of his honour shew this also to be true? "The tedious old man" continues going through "the vile letter" and "then," Pamela writes, "he swelled strangely, half over the table, as I thought, proud of his fine speech and wisdom." Although no scenes are untouched, certain ones are touched rather lightly: the fine ladies passage (added in the octavo), Pamela in her new country dress and Pamela with her three bundles, the two bedroom scenes, the meeting with the gypsy, the wedding (though the scenes before and after are entirely rewritten), Lady Davers's long scenes with Pamela and with Pamela and Mr. B. the next day. These are largely scenes of action. Those which consist of polite conversation (Pamela at Sir Simon and Lady Darnford's [1801, II, 194-206; 8vo, II, 269-293], for instance) or which involve motivation, especially the relation between Pamela and Mr. B. (the garden scene [1801, I, 280-283; 8vo, I, 349-354], or Pamela's meditations on whether to return [1801, II, 13-14; 8vo, II, 17-18]) are most heavily revised. Generally logical reasons for Pamela's actions are given, and it is shown clearly that she has always been as proper as she could be under difficult circumstances, but instead of the warmth of her earlier outpourings, we sometimes get rather cold explanations of her conduct. It cannot be said that the characters of Pamela and Mr. B. are fundamentally altered, but an effort is made to make them more consistent and to prepare the reader for the idealized characters of the third and fourth volumes. Richardson was evidently conscious of the gap between the servant girl and libertine of the beginning and the fine lady and gentleman of the end, and tried to bridge it. The gap proved unbridgeable; the plot of the novel forced Richardson to assume that a virtuous and intelligent girl can be made permanently blissful by marrying a man who has kidnapped her and tried hard to rape her. Many alterations seem designed to obviate such charges as those made in Shamela Andrews , the anonymous Lettre sur Pamela , 22 and Pamela Censured (pp. 21-22, passim ) that Pamela is too artful. It is Mrs. Jervis who "is very desirous" that she stay and finish Mr. B.'s waistcoat (1801, I, 45; 8vo, I, 58). Pamela does not decide to encourage John Arnold's repentance because she "may possibly make some Discoveries by it" (1801, I, 156; 8vo, I, 194), or think of herself as an innocent intriguer (1801, I, 167; 8vo, I, 208), or reflect when Mr. Williams goes to jail "so there is an End of all my Hopes from him" (1801, I, 224; 8vo, I, 278), or lie to Nan (1801, I, 204; 8vo, I, 253), or even prevaricate to Mrs. Jewkes (1801, I, 262, 266; 8vo, I, 327, 331-332). Pamela's modesty is less excessive, 23 especially her fears on her wedding day: when Pamela goes up to her chamber she no longer sees "(what made my Heart throb) Mrs. Jewkes 's officious Pains to put the Room in order for a Guest, that however welcome, as now my Duty teaches me to say, is yet dreadful to me to think of"; nor when the time of retiring draws near, does Mr. B. take "notice, but in a very delicate manner, how my Colour went and came, and how foolishly I trembled." Perhaps Richardson came to agree with Pamela's following remark (also cut), "Nobody, surely, in such delightful Circumstances, ever behav'd so sillily!" (1801, II, 133, 137; 8vo, II, 180, 187). She no longer implies a threat of suicide (1801, I, 184, 313-314; 8vo, I, 228, 393). She does not give up the idea of escape after her first failure (1801, I, 244; 8vo, I, 301). She does not anticipate Mr. B.'s proposal by her hopes (1801, I, 284, 301; 8vo, I, 354, 376-377). She is less pert (1801, I, 60, 66, 305, 308, II, 173, 177, 252, 278; 8vo, I, 78, 85, 381, 385, II, 244, 249, 53 386-387) and less humble (1801 II, 58, 69, 88-89, 125-126, 224, 280; 8vo, II, 73, 89, 119-120, 167-171, 317, 391) — even her father's humility is decreased (1801, II, 89; 8vo, II, 121). She does not go into ecstasies at the arrival of John Arnold (1801, I, 149; 8vo, I, 185), or fear that Robin may decide to rape her (1801, I, 124; 8vo, I, 164), or propose to ride horseback behind a man (1801, I, 61; 8vo, I, 80), or prop herself in the coach against Mr. Colbrand (1801, II, 16; 8vo, II, 20). These changes are fairly consistent and do serve to increase Pamela's dignity without destroying her simplicity. With Mr. B. Richardson is less successful, probably because he had less to work on. Mr. B.'s letters are more extensively rewritten than almost anything else in the book (1801, I, 110-113, 127, 130-131, 173-175, 216-218, 219-220; 8vo, I, 146-148, 166-168, 169, 217-219, 268-270, 272-274). Yet we do not see that his character emerges more clearly, or that the revisions make a great difference. Richardson seems to have recognized that something needed to be done with Mr. B., but he did not know what to do. Given the plot, Mr. B.'s case was hopeless. Still Richardson tried to make him more of a gentleman. Mr. B. insists less on his pride of station, and is somewhat less rude to Pamela (1801, I, 51, 81; 8vo, I, 65-66, 106). A few of the gross terms which Shamela Andrews had parodied and which the Lettre sur Pamela (pp. 9-12) had objected to are altered — Pamela is no longer a "Slut" or a "Hussy" or a "Baggage." After his proposal of marriage he is slightly less imperious (1801, II, 83, 194, 237; 8vo, II, 111, 269, 333); his rules on her conduct as a wife sound a little less like a master ordering his maid, and they are not inflicted on Pamela — she asks for them (1801, II, 153-157; 8vo, II, 214-222). The revision of Pamela is a reflection of a double aim not only in this book but in Richardson's art as a whole. Pamela is credible as a moderately clever and entirely proper little servant girl with a not-unjustifiable eye on the main chance, a high respect for rank, but an even higher respect for the moral lessons which have been instilled into her. She is at times funny, at times pathetic, always likeable — and as admirable as one would expect a girl of her class and her opportunities to be. But Richardson was not content to leave it at that. He needed a moral, which turned out to be the most immoral feature of the book: Mr. B. must be turned into a man who can be considered a reward for virtue. And he needed a model character: poor Pamela must be contorted into a fine lady and loaded with qualities (never conveyed through her words and actions, as is her real personality, but only stated) — she must use correct grammar and write wonderful poetry and carve turkeys and serve cake beautifully and love music and reading (in her spare time) and be weighted down with praises until the reader rebels and almost denies her the qualities she does possess. This split is apparent in the second volume of the first edition; it is even more apparent in Volumes III and IV; it is the motivation of many changes in all the revisions — nothing about Pamela must be open to criticism. A good example is the scene at Sir Simon's following Pamela's interview with Lady Davers (1801, II, 194-206; 8vo, II, 269-293). In the earlier editions Pamela keeps saying that she wants to make peace between Mr. B. and his sister — and then she reports all of Lady Davers's most outrageous remarks in full. She does not want to bother the company with her troubles — and she keeps bringing the subject up. This is the way Richardson's original Pamela would have acted. Later Richardson learned that this is not ideal ladylike behavior, and in the 1801 edition the scene is rewritten and Pamela is much closer to the ideal, but much less lively. He also learned that gentlemen do not discuss their family affairs so freely in public, and Mr. B. becomes more reserved. The gentry are no longer so openly eager in their desire to hear all the spicy details. It is all much less vulgar. But it is less real — not, perhaps, less like what gentlemen and ladies really did, but Richardson had realized his earlier vulgar ladies and gentlemen and only reports his later correct ones. The 1801 edition avoids a good many vulgarities and absurdities, and eliminates some of the involuntary farce. It is more carefully written and more consistent. Some of the more tedious passages are cut. And Richardson deserves credit for not altering more of the good ones and for not further elevating Pamela. At least throughout the first volume she remains alive, and is an only slightly toned-down, or toned-up, version of the girl whom Richardson had somehow conceived. The 1801 revision merely goes further in the direction in which the other revisions were headed. It accomplishes what the second, fifth, and octavo editions set out to do, and (probably with those changes in the eighth duodecimo edition which were not included in the 1801) it best represents Richardson's final intention. If any single text is to be preferred to it, that text is the first edition, which has never been reprinted. Both are necessary to students of Richardson, and neither is readily accessible. A double-column Pamela containing the text of the first edition (with variants from the other duodecimos and the octavo) and the text of the 1801 edition (with the adoption of the few readings from the 1810 which clearly correct misprints in the 1801) would doubtless best serve the scholar. But though one eighteenth-century admirer said that "if all the Books in England were to be burnt, this Book, next the Bible, ought to be preserved," 24 there is some doubt that it needs such extensive preservation. Both texts should be made available for anyone who wants to study Pamela in her country habit and in her country-gentry habit, but for anyone who simply wants to read Pamela for enjoyment, we believe that the text of the first edition should be the one reprinted. It is closer to the Pamela whom Richardson actually imagined, whereas all succeeding texts try to approach the Pamela he thought he should have imagined.</field>

This letter is in Forster MS XIII, 2, foll. 40-44, but has one missing page.

But on October 8, 1741, Richardson had written to Ralph Allen that Allen's objection to a passage in the introductory letters "is as just as it is kind," but that "when I come to perfect the Design in the Publication of the New Volumes [III and IV], I am advised to omit both the Introductory Preface[s] in the future Editions of the two first: And shall do it in an Octavo Edition I am printing. . . ." The praises, Richardson admitted, are too high (Forster MS XVI, 1, fol. 68). 11 Stinstra's file of his correspondence with Richardson has recently been discovered by Professor William Slattery in the Algemeen Rijksarchief, The Hague. Mr. Slattery, who is now editing this correspondence, has kindly given us permission to quote from his microfilm. 12 Forster MS XI, fol. 270. The copy (almost certainly a first draft) is in Richardson's own hand. It can be dated by Lady Bradshaigh's answer as well as a reference to a three months' silence and a recent letter to the Bishop of Man. 13 Forster MS XI, fol. 276. Letters from Lady Bradshaigh to Martha Richardson of March 19 and April 25, 1762 ( ibid. , foll. 279, 281) show that the volumes were returned after Richardson's death. 14 One volume of her copy of Sir Charles Grandison with marginalia is in the Henry E. Huntington Library; her copy of the first edition of Clarissa with marginalia is owned by her collateral descendant MacKinnon of MacKinnon. In Clarissa Lady Bradshaigh suggests cutting "-and-four" in "coach-and-four" (V, 212) and "trimm'd with silver," describing a cloak (III, 44). Four times she alters "Miss" (III, 329; VI, 271). She comments often on such matters of propriety, and Richardson, who felt his inadequacy, was likely to listen to her. 15 Biographical and Literary Anecdotes of William Bowyer (1782), p. 157; Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century (1812-1816), IV, 581. 16 Memoires (Paris et Londres, 1825), III, 292. 17 This correspondence, as well as that between Anne Richardson and Mrs. Moodie, is now in the possession of Professor Alan Dugald McKillop, who has generously allowed us to examine and use it. The first letter referred to is quoted in part by Mr. McKillop in Samuel Richardson Printer and Novelist (1936), pp. 59-60. 18 For example, the following sentiment (p. 48) first appears in the 1801 text: "Need there be a stronger proof of the danger of this pretension [platonic love], than this; that it is hardly ever set on foot, but among young people?" (see 1801, IV, 200). The phraseology of the following sentiment (p. 39) is very close to the text of 1801 and altogether different from the earlier texts: "After our wise parents have bribed our way thro' the customary forms, we are brought home, very little improved in our learning; and then our Parents take their deserved turn" (see 1801, II, 288). Miss L. in the continuation of Pamela becomes Miss Lucas in the Collection (p. 41) and in the 1801 text. 19 Proved in the Prerogative Court of the Archbishop of Canterbury, August 8, 1787 (Major 355).

      <field name="heading_text">William Strahan's Ledgers: Standard Charges for Printing, 1738-1785 by Patricia Hernlund</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is now generally accepted that William Strahan's printing business dominated English book production during the second half of the eighteenth century. The recent biography by J. A. Cochrane 1 has simply made plain in detail what many students of the eighteenth century have recognized as probable since the printer's bookkeeping records were found and placed in the British Museum in 1956. Twelve of these 119 volumes were written during Strahan's lifetime; they present the most complete picture now extant of printing procedures in the eighteenth century, once they are deciphered. But the very wealth of information, thousands of pages of bookkeeping entries in holograph, has led most students of the period to seek individual entries for specific books rather than to see the records as a whole, with a pattern of organization. Yet Strahan's practices are typical of the other printers and booksellers of the day even though his records surpass all others in number and variety. It is the representative nature of the data, their consistency and predictability, together with Strahan's known influence in the literary world which combine to produce in the record of Strahan's business an individual case which is characteristic of the prevailing pattern of book production in his day. Thus, Strahan's ledgers yield a standard reference for normal printing procedures not hitherto available. All that is necessary is to understand the pattern inherent in these records of Strahan's career. I propose here to explain two parts of this pattern: the way in which the ledgers fit into the history of bookkeeping as typical eighteenth-century business records, and the pattern which Strahan followed in charging his customers for printing. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Ledgers As Philip Gaskell commented in his article, "The Strahan Papers," the account books which Strahan kept for his business show part of the reason for his success, for they are remarkably thorough and accurate examples of bookkeeping. 3 Since the beginning of this century, when Richard Austen-Leigh wrote the first full book on Strahan, The Story of a Printing House , 4 these business records have been known generically as the "Ledgers" of William Strahan. And since 1950 and 1953, when William B. Todd first obtained permission to microfilm the records, the volumes have been designated in alphabetical sequence, which is less awkward than the numbering subsequently affixed to them by the British Museum. These so-called "Ledgers" show that William Strahan was a trained bookkeeper whose practices in double entry bookkeeping followed standard procedure as put forth in contemporary textbooks. The businessman first made out the "waste book" and put it in daily use. This waste book allowed the merchant to record transactions immediately and fully, but it had the defect of preventing the merchant's finding any particular transaction quickly, because the book was not arranged by name but by date. This defect had led merchants, at an earlier stage of bookkeeping, to adopt the Italian practice of double entry, which is simply that for every entry in the chronological waste book, there would be two entries, debit and credit, in the final ledger. This division of entries could be incorporated into the waste book if such was considered practical, but the task was complex and would lead to error. Therefore, a third, intermediate, book had come into use: the journal, which separated the debtors and creditors before they were placed alphabetically in the final ledger. When the waste book was "digested into form" and put in the journal, it was recommended that the merchant put a check mark opposite the original entry when he had finished dividing it, to prevent posting twice or omitting. Strahan's procedure was an alternative method of putting a large X through the entire entry, although he also used check marks at times. It was recommended that a ledger be started by titling each set of pages for the accounts, in roughly the same order as their first appearance in the waste book, and then writing out an "alphabet" at the front of the book for easy reference. Because Strahan was actively engaged in daily business, he did not follow current bookkeeping texts with slavish exactness; in fact, the texts themselves frown on such an idea. Strahan's entries were quite detailed by contemporary standards, and he followed the basic procedures outlined above; but his personal additions to standard practice were that he used the new idea of keeping several books of primary entry rather than only one kind of waste book, that he balanced by yearly totals, that he used self-balancing cash entries (in Ledgers H and I), and that he kept at least one columnar cash book (Ledger P). In addition to these up-to-date practices, he followed the relatively new practice of "journalizing," or dividing entries by debit and credit while they were still in the single entry format of a waste book (Ledgers B and C). The "Ledgers" are tabulated below in bookkeeping terms. Four volumes from the American Philosophical Society Library in Philadelphia have been added to the twelve in the British Museum so that the reader can see the complete alphabetical listing: the extension of Todd's system to include all separate volumes of Strahan's records which were written during his lifetime. 5 The sequence of derivation of these ledgers is quite plainly seen in their overlapping entries. Ledger C, which was found tucked inside Ledger B, is a waste book for B, which is itself an intermediate form of a partially separated waste book. The entries in B were transferred to Ledgers A and D, and to another ledger which has not survived. Thus the sequential Ledgers A and D are augmented by B, which is partially derived from C. The sequential Ledgers D and F are augmented by information in G, which is a journal for D, F, and a missing ledger called "my little quarto book" by Strahan. Ledger F is duplicated for the first nine years by Ledger E, which could therefore be called a journal or a ledger, but is useless for study because it is an exact duplicate of F as far as it goes. Ledgers A, D and F, then, evidently do not show us all of Strahan's business transactions even though they form an unbroken series of entries from 1738 to 1790; it is obvious, however, that they record most of the transactions in the private business, and that they are augmented by B, C and G. Any generalizations about Strahan's printing practices must be based on a study of at least Ledgers A, D, F, with the desirable addition of control data from B. In transferring entries from one book to another, Strahan was faced, as are other bookkeepers, with the difficulty of making sure that all of the entries were copied. In his method of double checking lies the reason for the otherwise mysterious "misplacing" of dates in the ledgers. The second time he went through a volume, Strahan would pick up overlooked entries and post them out of chronological order at the foot of the proper page in the new volume. As long as he got the entry on the correct page for the account, Strahan was following a standard method of procedure; therefore, a lack of chronological sequence on a page is not to be considered a mistake. It follows from this information that a reader must interpret the dates on any given page by referring to the context of the entire page rather than a simple sequence of entries. Strahan's method of writing down the day, month and year in the entries must also be made clear if the reader wants reliable information. All dating by Strahan is New Style and each entry is dated, but the exact day or month is frequently "understood." Just as Strahan does not clutter the page by repeating press runs if they are the same, entry after entry, so also he dates in groups ; therefore, any entry is to be considered as dated by the closest date above it if it is not specifically and separately dated. Dating was not so important to Strahan as it is to his twentieth-century readers since he knew he would not be paid in a brief time. It is a rare entry on the credit side of Strahan's ledgers which is not at least six months later than the corresponding debit. There was no need to bill a customer the instant his work was finished, nor was there any reason to bill the customers separately for each job. In addition, because of Strahan's billing method of including all extra charges, binding charges, distribution and publishing charges in the final version of any given set of entries, it is obvious that any given set was written into the final ledger as a unit as soon after the entire job was completed as was practical. On this series of inferences, I base my conclusion that the dating of the ledgers should be considered as the times when one or a group of jobs was billed to the customer after delivery: when the entries were transferred to journals (or ledgers), the entire information about extra charges was gathered and included, and the bills were sent out, dated with the dates which have survived in the ledgers. Several of the ledgers were designed to be examined by the customers involved in the accounts. We know that some customers came in to Strahan's shop, looked over their accounts in the ledger, probably haggled a bit, and then paid their debt, because these customers signed jointly with Strahan directly on the page of the ledger. On some of these occasions Strahan would lower the total bill by as much as a pound (rarely more). The practice, which is still in operation today, was called "abating" by Strahan when he noted it at the bottom of an account. There seem to have been three reasons for "abating": to make an even pound for a customer who brought cash, to give a rebate for prompt payment, or to forestall argument by lowering the price a token amount for a disgruntled customer as a sign of good faith. Strahan conducted a successful business on the basis of the highly codified entries in the ledgers. Once the consistency of the codification and its strict reliance on conventional bookkeeping are understood, the reader can see that the ledger entries are completely reliable even though they need interpretation. We shall now turn to a discussion of the content of the entries, to see what can be learned from them about the organization of Strahan's printing house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Establishment of the Unit Price: Entries before 1749 A few months after William Strahan's death in 1785, the London compositors and Masters came to their first "union wage agreement" which was binding for most (certainly the majority) of the printing companies in the city and set the precedent for a later agreement on pressmen's wages. 6 The principal grievance of the compositors was insecurity about their wages: not all printers charged the same prices for the same work and therefore did not give the same wages for the same work. Consequently, a compositor could not leave one shop to go to another one with any ease, for he had no assurance that the second shop would give the same wages he had been getting. Further, in any one shop the compositors did not have any assurance that the Master Printer would charge, or pay in wages, at the same rate for two similar jobs. The demand of the compositors in 1785 was that all prices and wages in all shops be the same for any given job. The same demand is still being made today, in union and non-union printing companies, for the problem of the standard scale of prices is persistent in the printing industry. Even when a standard scale exists, it will be imperfect as far as the employees are concerned, because a scale is fixed whereas the material they work on will not be the same for any two jobs. In spite of the complaints of the eighteenth-century compositors, price scales were being used long before 1785, and, specifically in the business of William Strahan, the scale was consistent and practical but flexible. The compositors could not have had as strong a grievance against Strahan as they had against some small shops. Even though there is not enough information available to prove whether Strahan's scale resulted in high or in low wages, there is ample evidence to prove that Strahan's wages must have been the same for two similar jobs and that they must have been consistent. We can know this by extrapolating from the consistency of the prices he charged his customers. I shall, therefore, examine the price scales for standard work as it was charged to the customer at Strahan's private business. 7 Discussion of Strahan's standard scale of prices for his customers can be divided into three parts: the methods of entry in the ledgers, the unit price for work, and the cost of paper. In addition to the standard scale, Strahan maintained a separate, consistent scale for "extra" work. Since this discussion will concentrate on the methods of entry and the unit price for work, there will be no concentration on paper or "extra" charges, which are separate studies in themselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Methods of Entry in the Ledgers There are several kinds of entries for debit and credit in the ledgers, but Strahan used only two kinds of standard debit entries for printing. The first kind was used for "job work" or "jobbing," that is, for certain work which varied in size from cards and announcements through titles and broadsides of one page, to bills, acts, law cases, summonses, and advertisements up to a size of approximately 2½ sheets maximum. "Job work" of this sort is still used today — as it was in the eighteenth century — as a practical way to "fill unsold time" (the fallow periods between contracts for book work). Although "jobbing" was generally applied to work of one page or less, the true distinction lay in the kind of typesetting employed; if very little setting was required, or if the job was "ganged" (one printing from multiple typesetting to produce more than one copy from each sheet), the work was called "jobbing." Strahan did not ordinarily print runs of fewer than fifty copies in "job work"; his usual run was between 100 and 250 copies, and the highest run I found for "jobbing" was for 104,000 octavo proposals for Rapin's History of England in numbers, run in 1758. 8 Generally, when the run became very large, Strahan would change to a variant method of entry in which he kept a record of the reams of paper used, but for most of the "job work" he used a method of entry in which the entire "job" was the basic unit for billing purposes. Roughly one-half of the printing entries in the ledgers are of this sort; in addition, all of the entries for "extra charges" also followed the format. Sometimes such pertinent information as the run of copies or the size of sheet, the kind of paper or occasionally the type face would be included, but Strahan did not consider it necessary to itemize details of such simple work, nor did his customers expect more information than the flat rate for the total job, since they had contracted for the work on that basis. Some customers required only "job work" (e.g., the New River Company, the Scots Corporation, the Goldsmiths' Company, and many law firms), but the method of entry was not restricted to such companies. For example, below are eight "jobbing" entries chosen to show variety of subject matter as well as the simplicity of the entry: 1741 £ s d Decr. 17 To printing 1000 Bills for Sale of Waste Paper 0. 6. 0 1743 Febry For printing three Reams of Prayers etc. in Welsh and English 1. 10. 0 1739 Decr. 8 To printing one Quire of Summons for Merchant Taylors 0. 4. 0 1742 Janry 23 For printing the Case John Mackye Esqr. 850 copies 4. 4. 0 1739 March 27 For printing an Elegy 100 Copies 0. 10. 6 1742 March 27 For printing the Letter to Mr. Watts 10,000 Copies [ sic ] 4. 0. 0 1742 July 4 For 2 Jobbs for Poulter's Company 0. 17. 0 For 2 Lists for Oxfordshire and Hampshire 0. 8. 6 1747 Oct. [For printing 13 Sheets of Hill's Fossils No. 700 Coarse &amp; 50 Fine &amp;c.mmat; 14d. pr. sh. 9. 2. 0] For printing 1000 Quarto Proposals 2. 10. 0 In the first seven examples above, the "jobbing" entry is used to show an entire contract for work; in the last example, the entry is used in connection with a larger unit of "book" work (in brackets). The "jobbing" entry is thus used to show an entire contract in one simple entry, or it is the format followed for "extra charges" involved in the printing of a larger contract for "book" work. The second method of entry for printing was used in roughly one-half of the printing entries. This "book" entry was designed for book and periodical printing and was much more detailed and flexible than the "jobbing" entry. The basic pattern was the same throughout Strahan's career. The details and ordering were as follows: a. "For Printing __________." b. "_____ vols." (frequently followed by the number of the edition, where pertinent), c. "_____ sheets," d. "No. _____" (number of copies in press run), e. "&amp;c.mmat;£ _____ per Sheet," f. The total price. Items a and b were necessary for identification; items c through f were used in various combinations for computation and billing. The unit price (e) and the number of sheets (c) were the most important items in any entry, for it was from multiplying these two that the total price was determined. During his first seven years in business, Strahan diligently recorded all of the items above as well as, in many instances, the type face and sheet size. Later, during the period from 1745 to 1749, his scale of prices for each type face and sheet size was sufficiently well-established for him to depend on it, and so he simply recorded the unit price (e) without the addition of type face and sheet size. After 1749, Strahan saw a further simplification and gradually began to follow it: since the unit price was so well established, it was only necessary for him to record the number of sheets and the total price in his ledger in order to compute, later, what the unit price had been. In general, however, Strahan used a middle method, neither extremely detailed nor extremely simplified. To illustrate, I have randomly chosen one page of billing in order to reproduce all of the printing entries for one page to indicate the method and the variations Strahan used in simplifying. The entries from Ledger A, folio 137 verso, happen to be for Andrew Millar, but since he was Strahan's best customer, the choice does not militate against random choice so much as it points out the fact that Millar was Strahan's most frequent customer, until his successor Thomas Cadell took over Millar's business. Mr. Andrew Millar Dr. [debtor] 1767 £ s d Novr. Adventures of Joseph Andrews, 2 vol. 20 Sheets No. 1000 &amp;c.mmat;£ 1:7:0 27 1768 Janry. Ball's Practise of Physick, 2 vol. 3d.

The fifth entry is an example of the first or "jobbing" method of entry, used to keep track of Millar's share in a partnership venture ("yr. half") which was recorded in detail elsewhere. It can also be seen from the examples that excess information, such as the words "for printing," was eliminated as the years went by. The number of volumes was included only when it seemed pertinent to Strahan; the number of the edition or the sheet size was sometimes entered, sometimes not. These refinements were signals for Strahan to return to his waste book if he needed more information; in most cases we cannot check the accuracy of the signals because the waste books and most of the journals have disappeared. But the variations serve to accentuate the flexibility of the "book" method of debit entry for printing rather than to obscure the method.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Unit Charge The nature of Strahan's standard scale of prices can be determined from examination of entries from Ledger A, made during Strahan's early years in business when he recorded more information than was really necessary for bookkeeping and thereby left vital evidence for the reconstruction of his scale of prices to the customer. In the reconstructed scale which follows, the abbreviation "L.P." has been used for Long Primer type face. There are several gaps and some anomalies in this scale of prices, for Strahan, of course, did not realize that his scale would some day be reconstructed from the ledgers; he undoubtedly had it available for daily use in written or printed form. However, it is apparent from the reconstruction above that a regular scale was the standard method of fixing the unit charge for any job. We see that the unit charge was a certain price for each sheet. The price for this unit was determined by (1) the size of the sheet, (2) the size of the type, and (3) the press run of copies. The Size of the Sheet The scale shows that octavo was the usual sheet size for English, Pica and Small Pica type, but large octavo was also popular. Duodecimo was the usual size for smaller type, especially Long Primer. The price did not necessarily vary simply with the size of the sheet, but with the relationship between the sheet and the type used. The Size of the Type On the one hand, if a small type were used for a large sheet, the price was higher for any run of copies than if a large type were used: more typesetting was involved in using small type. On the other hand, even if a small type were used, the charge would depend on the exact relationship between the type size and the sheet. For example, if a job were set in Small Pica and run as octavo, it would involve less type-setting than if it were set in Small Pica and run as a large octavo, because the line measure of large octavo is longer than regular octavo if the margin of white space around the type is not changed. This same Small Pica, if run in duodecimo, would have less work than octavo sheets in some respects: the line measure would be shorter and there would be fewer lines to the page; but, in other respects, more furniture and spacing would have to be handled because there would be eight more pages to set to complete the sheet than in octavo even if the line measure were shorter. Thence the price for a duodecimo in Small Pica could easily be more than for a large octavo on one occasion and less on another occasion, according to the Master Printer's opinion of the difficulty and quantity of the typesetting, which would include his figuring ahead of time the line measure and the number of lines per page — in other words, the unit price would always depend on the results of "casting off copy" before the job was begun. This practice resulted in Strahan's fixing more than one price for a unit charge. For example, 1000 copies of Small Pica duodecimo could cost as little as £1.4.0 per sheet, or as much as £1.12.0, depending on the results of the casting-off process. Strahan's casting-off must have been standardized to conform to his scale of prices with little deviation of line measure or margin, for the anomalies in the scale above are few, once the relationship between the kind of work, the type face, and the sheet size has been accepted as causing slight fluctuations for any given run. The Press Run of Copies The information from the scale above, supplemented by other information from later periods in Strahan's career, shows that from 1738 to 1785 the most frequently ordered press run was 500 copies, and that a run of 1000 was second in frequency. Runs of 500 or 1000 copies account for more than half of the press runs which I tabulated as typical of entries in Ledgers A, B, D and F. Copies Instances 500 175 1000 139 750 77 1500 43 250 37 2000 28 3000 15 All of these most frequently requested runs were multiples of a "token" (250 copies) rather than "bastard" runs of less than an even token, such as 400 or 800. It is notable that longer runs of 2000 and 3000 are much more frequent than has generally been supposed true in eighteenth-century printing. It can be proved that the unit price for work increased in direct proportion to the increase in the press run, by using the scale of unit prices above and information from later periods in Strahan's career to reconstruct a scale of unit prices charged for each of the seven most frequently used press runs. These prices fall naturally into three ranges for each run; in the scale below I have attributed these three price ranges to the use of specific type faces and sheet sizes, but it should be remembered that my attribution is hypothetical, since the exact relationship between the press run and the type and sheet cannot be known with absolute certainty. The scale was constructed from 406 instances of unit charges for press runs between 1738 and 1785 ("No.") and indicates the possibility of a higher top price in the price ranges marked "+." The scale shows that Strahan's customers where charged a unit price in an ascending scale according to the press runs they ordered, as well as according to the type face and sheet size. If the exact relationship of these factors in the unit price were known, we could reconstruct the pressmen's wage scale; but even with the simple scale above it is possible to infer, from the regular patterns of increase, that the pressmen did have a regular scale of wages throughout Strahan's career. The longer runs cost proportionately much more than the shorter runs, because type in the eighteenth century did not last as long as type does today; consequently, a long run in Strahan's business could easily mean that he would have to restock on the particular face because of wear. Further, each additional token resulted in more pressmen's wages, more ink and other material, more washing of the form (especially if the job ran to a second day), and, of course, less flexibility for press scheduling of small or "rush" jobs when one or more presses were occupied with long runs. Today, long runs cost proportionately less than shorter runs, because of the high speed of continuously operating electrical presses printing solidly cast linotype or plates. Even today it is true, however, that hand-set type is charged at a premium if it is ordered for a long run rather than being plated; many shops refuse to use certain hand-set type for anything but "reproduction proof."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Later Evidence of the Unit Price: Entries after 1749 Because of Strahan's simplification of the entries, there is less information in the ledgers after 1745-49; but there is still enough to corroborate the statement that Strahan's charges in later years followed the unit charge for each sheet, and that the unit charge was always based on type, the size of the sheet, and the number of copies run, as established during Strahan's first years of business. It is notable that the unit price increased very little over the years until some time during the Revolutionary War. I cannot fix the gradations of this price increase beyond saying that the unit price in 1785 showed a distinct increase for all categories over the prices of 1776.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Type From the scale of prices above, we see that before 1749, when almost all entries included the type face used, the faces most frequently mentioned were: 1. Pica ............................................... 52 2. English ............................................ 41 3. Small Pica ......................................... 37 4. Long Primer ........................................ 18 5. Great Primer ....................................... 6 6. Brevier ............................................ 5 7. Pica and Long Primer ............................... 2 8. Long Primer and Brevier ............................ 2 9. Double Pica ........................................ 1 10. Pica and Small Pica ................................ 1 11. Bourgeois .......................................... 0 12. Small Letter ....................................... 0 __ 165 From this frequency list, we can arrive at the "standard" faces: Appropriate for text or medium sheets: English, Pica, Small Pica Appropriate for notes or small sheets: Long Primer and some Brevier After 1749, when Strahan simplified his ledger entries, he eliminated mention of any faces except those used in an unusual or "extra" manner. This absence of mention provides us with one of the three kinds of evidence about type after 1749. We would expect that the "standard" faces, established above, would not appear often in the entries but that the smaller faces might appear as "extra charges." Such is exactly the case. I could find only forty-nine instances after 1749 in which type face was named, either in the standard entries or in the "extra charges." These show just the reversal of frequency which we would expect: Instances 1. English ............................................... 0 2. "Large Letter" [Great Primer?] ...................................... 1 3. Pica and Small Pica ................................... 1 4. Small Pica with Brevier ............................... 1 5. "Large Pica" [Double Pica? or large sheet of Pica?] ...................................... 2 6. Bourgeois ............................................. 2 7. Small Pica ............................................ 3 8. Pica .................................................. 5 9. Brevier ............................................... 6 10. Long Primer ........................................... 9 11. Small Letter .......................................... 19 It is apparent that if Strahan only mentioned type faces forty-nine times after 1749, he must have been using his price scale (which has been reconstructed above) to set each unit charge; using the scale would eliminate the necessity for recording type faces in the ledgers. However, "small letter" was still recorded with some frequency — in the context of notes, indexes and appendixes rather than of text or body work. When frequency is correlated with price in the scale, we find that Strahan's charges for standard and non-standard faces were completely consistent with the size appropriate for body or text work and notes or small work: Cheapest: Double Pica Great Primer Intermediate: English Pica Small Pica Extra Charge: Bourgeois Long Primer Brevier High Extra Charge: Small Letter (Non Pareil or Pearl) The other two kinds of evidence about type after 1749 are found in two ledgers which show (1) Strahan's purchases for the private business and (2) type on hand at the law house. Purchases of Type for the Private Business Five pages in Ledger B show forty-one purchases of type from the firm of Alexander Wilson, typefounder in Glasgow, between 1754 and 1776, as well as four returns of unused or faulty type. Although these records do not show all of Strahan's purchases of type, they do show how much of each kind he purchased from one company over a period of years. Since we do not know what type Strahan already had on hand, the only safe conclusion which can be drawn from this table is that he purchased more English type than any other kind from Wilson between 1754 and 1776; we cannot conclude, of course, that Strahan did not use Pica, etc., at all, for we know from the ledger entries that he did. Further, it is notorious that Scottish type height has always been different from London type height; some twentieth-century printing companies still keep old Scottish type separately cased. Therefore, Strahan probably bought his Pica, etc., from a Scottish founder rather than from his other regular supplier, William Caslon, whose type was used in the law house. Type on Hand at the Law House The amounts of type used in the law house seem to correlate more closely with the mention and lack of mention of type in the ledgers than do the type purchases from Wilson shown above. The following table shows the total poundage of old and new type on hand for the four presses of the law house when it was inventoried at the expiration of the Law Patent in 1789. The relative proportions of type faces are close to the proportions one would expect to find in the private business except that the law house had no Double Pica or Bourgeois in 1789 and that the poundage is much less than would have been on hand at the private business, which was easily three times the size of the law house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Considerations Involved in Fixing the Unit Price Even though "standard" faces — English, Pica and Small Pica — were charged at a standard rate set in the scale of prices, it remained the work of the Master or the Overseer to cast-off copy in such a way that he not only conformed to the scale but also allowed a profit margin to take care of the nature and condition of the copy: the number of "hard words," the complexity of the syntax, the handwriting of the copy. It is the state of the copy which forces a modification of any scale of prices when unusual work comes into the house and which makes customers today as well as in the eighteenth century willing to accept a higher scale-rate rather than incur "extra" charges because their copy is "dirty." Strahan's scale had to include enough profits after wages to cover the variables which could not be charged "extra" in the ordinary run of business. He was successful in making his scale sufficient to cover most occasions, for the ledgers show only fourteen instances out of 996 entries in which "extra" charges were made for original composition. Of these fourteen, ten were divided among five publications: one short-lived periodical, the East India Miscellany (three instances), and three works in which Strahan was a partner and could therefore charge "extra" for "dirty copy" without worrying about a customer's reaction, Isaac Ware's Architecture (two instances), Sir John Hill's Herbal (two instances), and a Naval History (three instances). It is safe to say that Strahan consistently and constantly applied the scale to all except a negligible number of jobs. As can be seen from the scale of unit prices, Strahan's customers were always charged at a higher rate for "mixed" sheets. To judge from the entries for these sheets, two type faces could be mixed in one sheet up to a fixed maximum without a higher charge, but beyond the maximum a higher scale began which increased as the proportion of mixture increased. Mixtures of two languages resulted in a higher rate immediately, but sheets entirely in Latin did not necessarily have a higher rate. All languages which used an alphabet other than the Roman (thus necessitating a different type font whereas Latin did not) were, however, charged at a much higher rate. When Strahan did not have the alphabet of a particular type face on hand, he ordered the casting of fonts or sorts and charged the customer a separate, "extra" fee for the casting as well as the higher rate for unfamiliar setting. Charges for half sheets were always one-half of the charge for full sheets (I could find only one exception); but when the casting-off showed that a quarter sheet would be needed (e.g., in a job of 10¾ or 5¼ sheets), Strahan followed one of three practices. Usually, he charged the price for the exact one-quarter or three-quarter sheet, presumably absorbing the cost of the extra work in his profit margin. Occasionally, he charged for the next higher half sheet; since a quarter sheet, especially three-quarters, is actually an unprintable unit except in unusual circumstances, this practice was a perfectly proper business charge. It can be inferred that in these instances Strahan was unwilling to absorb the extra cost of finding a small press free and cutting paper to fit it; instead, he made an additional charge to the customer, which may or may not have covered the cost to Strahan. Rarely (in two instances) Strahan charged a rate between the cost of the quarter sheet and the cost of the next higher half sheet. Unless these two instances are mistakes in arithmetic (which is extremely rare in the ledgers), it can be inferred that these two customers were given a slight preferment in price but not the lowest cost, presumably because they should have avoided the extra quarter sheet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Representative Nature of Strahan's Methods There is sufficient published evidence about other eighteenth-century printers to confirm what logic dictates: that Strahan's highly codified procedures discussed above were not his invention but were the procedures of the large or moderately large London printing companies during most of the century. Four examples of similarity of method will serve to indicate the kind of evidence from which I infer the representative nature of Strahan's ledgers as they reflected his business practices. The practices of William Bowyer II can be partially reconstructed from study of John Nichols' complicated but valuable Biographical and Literary Anecdotes of William Bowyer, Printer, F.S.A. (1782); Bowyer appears to have used much the same methods of working and of recording his business that Strahan used. 9 Samuel Richardson's similar printing practices are detailed in William M. Sale Jr.'s Samuel Richardson: Master Printer (1950) and in I. G. Philips' William Blackstone and the Reform of the Oxford University Press in the Eighteenth Century (Oxford Bibliographical Society Publications, New Series, VII, 1957 for 1955) where are reproduced several documents Richardson wrote about London printing scales and practices. We also have a good sampling of the ledgers of Benjamin Collins of Salisbury, published in an appendix to Charles Welsh's study of Newbery, A Bookseller of the Last Century (1885). 10 A fourth source of evidence is John Smith's The Printer's Grammar (1755), probably the only eighteenth-century handbook for compositors. Smith's description of procedures is remarkably like those Strahan must have followed in order to have kept the ledgers as he did. The methods and scales of Strahan's private business can, then, be safely taken as the typical procedures of printing in London during the eighteenth century — not "primitive" or "antique" but detailed and necessary practices inherent in the mass production of literature and still used today in a great many shops because they are the proper practices for printing in quantity.

No reference will be made to the public businesses except in one instance to verify evidence of the kind of type stored. Statements on the following pages are based on 2,341 items of data from 711 representative samples of printing entries in Ledgers A, B, D and F. 8 The highest consistently re-ordered job work which Strahan recorded was for the Stationers' Company. He frequently ran "forty reams," 20,000 copies, of "the Non Pareil Psalms"; he ran even longer orders of the "Cambridge Almanac": up to 50,000 copies. 9 Bowyer was in business in 1727, twelve years before Strahan; a fragment of his ledgers is reproduced and discussed in P.T.P.'s "Woodfall's Ledger," Notes and Queries , First Ser., XI (1855) and in Herbert Davis's "Bowyer's Paper Stock Ledger," Library , 5th Ser., VI (1951). 10 Strahan knew the three men cited. He took business away from Bowyer in the 1740's (notably the Methodist accounts); Richardson helped Strahan by giving him parts of large jobs, and Strahan remained a grateful friend; Collins was in partnership with Strahan in several, perhaps many, publishing ventures.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">"Woodcuts dropped into the Text": The Illustrations in The Old Curiosity Shop And Barnaby Rudge by Joan Stevens</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the relevance to their exact placing of the illustrations set into the text in the first published form of The Old Curiosity Shop and Barnaby Rudge , and to examine Dickens's policy in subsequent reprints. It will be shown that the insets function significantly in narrative, characterisation and theme, that the resulting composite achievement is remarkable, and that subsequent publishing failure to honour Dickens's intentions has disastrously obliterated the pointed textual relevance which his illustrations were planned to have. Textual accuracy, that is, for these two novels, as for reprints of Thackeray's similar "pen and pencil" work, must be taken to include accuracy about the placing of inset woodcuts. When Dickens was planning Master Humphrey's Clock early in 1840, he enlisted the services of the artist George Cattermole, well known for his illustrations of landscape and architecture in the novels of Scott. After describing to him the plan of the periodical, Dickens wrote: Now among other improvements, I have turned my attention to the illustrations, meaning to have woodcuts dropped into the text and no separate plates [italics added]. I want to know whether you would object to make me a little sketch for a woodcut — in indian-ink would be quite sufficient — about the size of the enclosed scrap; the subject, an old quaint room with antique Elizabethan furniture, and in the chimney-corner an extraordinary old clock — the clock belonging to Master Humphrey, in fact, and no figures. This I should drop into the text at the head of my opening page . . . . I should tell you that I intend to ask Maclise to join me likewise, . . . 1 Cattermole accepted the commission. His sketch of Master Humphrey's room heads the opening recto of the first edition. "I cannot tell you how admirably I think Master Humphrey's room comes out", wrote Dickens delightedly ( Letters , I, 251-252), and gave Cattermole thereafter thirty-eight more of the 194 illustrations which decorated the Clock in the eighty-eight issues of its lifetime. The remainder were drawn by H.K. Browne, with the exception of the woodcut of Little Nell and the Sexton which was given to Maclise. Master Humphrey's Clock was conceived as a weekly miscellany, "of which a certain amount of numbers should form a volume, to be published at regular intervals." It was modelled on the Tatler , the Spectator , and Goldsmith's Bee , and was to "introduce a little club or knot of characters and to carry their personal histories and proceedings through the work", Sam Weller and Mr. Pickwick being among the persons included ( Letters , I, 218-220). Master Humphrey, from his clockside in the chimney corner, provided readers with various tales, one of which, headed as the "Personal Adventures of Master Humphrey. The Old Curiosity Shop", opened the fourth issue, occupying ten of its twelve pages (plate I). Public response to the Clock assortment was disappointing however, and Dickens abandoned Humphrey after the eleventh issue, devoting the periodical thereafter solely to the serialisation of The Old Curiosity Shop (to issue 45), and Barnaby Rudge (issues 46-88). (The abbreviations OCS and BR will be used hereafter). Master Humphrey appears again only when required to conclude OCS and introduce BR in issue 45, and to conclude the whole in issue 88. Dickens reveals in issue 45 that the anonymous 'single gentleman' who is the deus ex machina of OCS is Humphrey himself, thus justifying the title "Personal Adventures" announced under the abandoned plan. Dickens did not, however, abandon his policy about the illustrations "dropped into the text". When OCS and BR were issued in separate book form in 1841, the Clock stereotypes were used, with only the few alterations made necessary by the excision of Clock material. In consequence, these two stories remained before the public for the next twenty years in two forms only: that of their first issue, illustrated with woodcuts set into the text, and that without illustrations at all except frontispieces, in the Cheap Edition ( OCS 1848, BR 1849) and the Library Edition ( OCS 1858, BR 1859). No illustrated edition appeared to change their physical image until the illustrated reissue of the Library Edition in 1861, for which each novel was allotted thirty-two full page plates, re-engraved from the original woodcuts and inserted with captions at their appropriate pages. This brought OCS and BR into the same style as the Number novels. The Illustrated Library Edition of 1873-76 reverted to insets for these two novels, not however reproducing them all, nor adhering scrupulously to the original placings. Later editions resumed the use of selected plates, with occasional concessions only, as in the Gadshill Edition , to the original layout. The current New Oxford Illustrated Dickens offers all the original illustrations except the decorated initials, but reproduces them upon inserted leaves, not within the text itself, and adds its own explanatory captions. This change from textually integrated woodcuts to separately inserted plates has hidden from later readers certain of the functions and qualities of the illustrations in OCS and BR as they were planned in 1840-41. Dickens thought of his inset illustrations as an "improvement" upon "separate plates". What did he have in mind? Plates would of course have required to be printed separately, and issued as a supplement to each weekly part, as was the custom with novels appearing in Numbers. Woodcuts on the other hand could be printed along with the text at little extra cost, and without distribution problems. Though, however, financial considerations may have weighed initially with Dickens, it is clear that his inset illustrations soon came to serve much more sophisticated purposes. Apart from convenience and economy, an obvious intention at the outset of the enterprise was to exploit the double sales appeal of pictures and words. Phiz was already famous as a Dickensian, Cattermole was an established illustrator of romantic fiction; Dickens therefore announced the Clock as "with illustrations by G. Cattermole and H.K. Browne", and set out to make it visually attractive. Issues 1-5, 7, 9, and 10 begin with half-page headpieces and decorated initials, issues 2, 5, and 8 have tailpieces, while 1 and 3 have insets on the final verso. There are twelve insets on inner pages, making a total of thirty-three woodcuts in the first eleven issues. After issue 12, when OCS took over the whole periodical, the number of illustrations was modified. This embellishment of the early issues follows a pattern. Humphrey is stressed in the headpieces to issues 1, 3, 5 and 7. A headpiece is allotted to the opening of a new feature, such as "Mr. Weller's Watch" (issue 9) and OCS (issue 4). There is no headpiece in issue 11, which is rather obviously marking time. Issue 12, however, asserts the primary of the serial with a headpiece of Nell, her grandfather and Quilp, pictured in the interior of the Shop, which has been pictorially established for readers by earlier woodcuts, two in issue 4 and one in issue 7. This headpiece is the last appearance of the Shop, for Nell and her grandfather leave it "at the beginning of a day in June" at the end of issue 13, that for Saturday June 27th, 1840. The Clock was published not only as a weekly, but in monthly Numbers every fourth or fifth week, at 1/- or 1/3 according to size. 2 A second consideration, then, was the structure of the monthly unit. In the first five Numbers no pattern of illustration relevant to it can be discerned. With the sixth Number, issues 22-26, however, Dickens seems to have settled upon a standard procedure by which the woodcuts mark off the physical identity of the monthly set. This Number, which concludes Volume I of the Clock , opens with a headpiece and initial and ends with a tailpiece, no other headpieces appearing. After this, with two exceptions only, each Number carries a headpiece with initial on its opening recto but nowhere else, while most have a tailpiece or inset on the final verso. The exceptions are Number 10 (issues 40-44), which has an initial but no headpiece, and Number 11 (issues 45-48), which has a central tailpiece for the end of OCS and a central headpiece with initial for the opening of BR . The final Number, 20, in November 1841, carries an opening headpiece with initial for chapter lxxv of BR , and a tailpiece which, in Dickens's description of it to Cattermole, represents "Master Humphrey's Clock as stopped — his chair by the fireside empty . . . Master Humphrey being supposed to be no more" ( Letters , I, 349-350). The third consideration which Dickens had in mind in his reference to the 'improvement' which inset illustrations would offer is that of their closer relationship to the matter of his stories. Owing to the fortuitous development of the first of the Clock serials, OCS , its illustrative pattern is somewhat haphazard until the story is well under way. In its latter half, and in the following BR , the woodcuts are planned and placed with great care to supplement the text. Though Dickens never lost sight of the advantage of exploiting his artists to the full, and of the necessity therefore of providing them with a good "subject", he came gradually in his use of illustration to combine this purpose with several others. As the two novels proceeded, there are fewer digressions into merely pictorial detail. Among the narrative purposes for which Dickens increasingly came to organize his insets, first perhaps is that of helping the reader to keep his hold on the story as it jerked along in its weekly sections. This was especially necessary in OCS , which was Dickens's first attempt in this mode and has only an elementary plot line. Nell and her grandfather leave London at the end of the eighth instalment of the story, chapters xi and xii in issue 13, after which Dickens maintains a triple zig-zag between their doings and those of the two London groups in the Kit-Garland and Quilp-Brass plots. He devotes four or five issues to the Londoners, followed by the same number to the wanderers; after issue 35 (chapters liv and lv), Nell goes into her slow decline unvisited by the reader for eight weeks while Dickens develops the plot involving Kit, Quilp, Swiveller, the Marchioness, and the single gentleman. Finally, in issues 43 and 44 the Londoners and the wanderers are drawn together in the denouement. The narrative transitions at these changes of direction in OCS are usually self-conscious and clumsy; an example is the opening of issue 24 (chapter xxxiii), which switches us from Mrs. Jarley's waxworks to London: ". . . the historian takes the friendly reader by the hand, and springing with him into the air . . . alights with him upon the pavement of Bevis Marks. The intrepid aeronauts alight before a small dark house, once the residence of Mr. Sampson Brass." The openings of Chapters xxxviii, xlii and xlvii are equally maladroit. 3 With a narrative zig-zag like this, Dickens needed every device he could muster to impress on his readers' memory the important actors, incidents, and themes. He had of course a wide variety of verbal methods for this, but in OCS and BR he exploited also the emphasis which illustrations could provide. One obvious use of the woodcuts is to mark the first entry of characters and of themes, which are then recalled to mind after intervening weeks with a second illustration. This strategy may be observed in the cuts of the Shop itself, which in the twelve chapters of its existence is given two headpieces and three insets. Two of these first illustrations are echoed thematically both in the centre of the story and in the finale. That in the centre, in chapter liii of issue 34, the cut of Nell sitting in the church aisle gazing sadly at the "broken and dilapidated" antiquities that encumber it, recalls to the reader's mind the first images of her amid the discordant oddities of the Shop (plates I, II B). That of her deathbed in chapter lxxi in issue 44 recalls the inset at the end of chapter 1 in issue 4, in which she lies on her bed "in her gentle slumber, smiling through her light and sunny dreams." 4 Similar devices of emphasis and recall can be observed in the Quilp illustrations. Dickens makes Quilp memorable in various ways in the text, by his physique, his dress, his hideous gaiety, his tricks of speech, his ingenious malice; the impression is deepened by the visual image offered at his first introduction, and repeated at the moments of his horrifying re-entries. When he first appears in issue 8, he is pictured twice. In 9/5, we see his wharf, while his den there heads 10/6. He broods gleefully over the distress of Nell and the old man in the Shop headpiece to 12/9, and appears subsequently in issues 13, 14, 18 and 19. There is then an interlude while we follow Nell's fortunes, but Dickens reminds us of Quilp's remorseless pursuit of her in the brief glimpse she has of him in an old gateway in 21/27. 5 When the story swerves again to London in 24/33, Quilp's re-entry is marked by a woodcut and he appears further in 32/48 and 49, and 33/50 and 51. On Kit's arrest in 38/60, Quilp is given a particularly dramatic inset, leering triumphantly from the tavern window (plate IV); in 39/62 he is seen battering the old figurehead that is "like Kit". Finally, set centrally into issue 42, he is allotted the tailpiece for chapter lxvii, which shows his corpse washed ashore downriver. Thus eighteen major woodcuts, nearly a quarter of the total in OCS , are devoted to Quilp. There are many other examples of pictorial emphasis for important matters. Among them may be noted these: Kit holds the Garland pony in 14/14, a plot item leading to his later fortunes; Nell meets the Punch puppeteers in 15/16, as readers remember three months later in 26/37 when the single gentleman is so mysteriously interested in Punch and Judy shows; the old man's gambling mania is vividly suggested in the parallel cuts of 22/29 and 29/42, the pair of illustrations in this instance serving to bridge the seven issues in which we have been following, not his affairs, but those of the Londoners. The Swiveller-Marchioness connection is brought suddenly and strongly forward in issues 36 to 41 (chapters lvi to lxvi), with the aid of five woodcuts by Phiz. 6 The initial designs, too, though sometimes merely decorative in the fashion of the time, often have a specific function. That for 4/1, of a night watchman in Pump Court, matches the opening sentence (plate I). Several serve to link together successive issues. For example, the last page of 30/45 tells of "a traveller on foot, who, with a portmanteau strapped to his back, leant upon a stout stick, as he walked, and read from a book which he held in his other hand." This is resumed in the opening of 31/46, "It was the poor schoolmaster," with an initial design portraying him as described the week before. Similarly, the headpiece and initial of 17/19 both feature events at the Jolly Sandboys inn in 16/18 where Nell and her grandfather have supper with the show people and the performing dogs. The headpiece shows the chaotic meal table, the initial design is of clowns and tumblers. Another detail to which Dickens paid attention is the physical image presented by the final verso of an issue, and its usefulness for concluding a theme, or confirming a mood, with the display of a memorable illustration. In the forty issues which carry OCS , seventeen final versos offer illustrations; seven are issue tailpieces, the rest half page insets. Both types mark moments of significance in narrative or theme. Examples of half-page insets are those of 14/14 (Kit holds the pony), 28/41 (the single gentleman sets out in search of Nell), 35/55 (Little Nell and the Sexton,) 7 36/57 (Swiveller and the Marchioness at cribbage). The best examples of the functional value of the final verso inset are however those at 13/12 and 44/72. At 13/12 Dickens deliberately plans a climax (plate V). The issue is that for June 27th, 1840. Nell and her grandfather are leaving the old Shop forever. Five lines of text head the page, ending with the words "The child . . . putting her hand in his, led him gently away." Then comes the woodcut, showing the two moving over the cobblestones, and the words run on, "It was the beginning of a day in June; . . ." Two paragraphs follow emphasizing the light, physical and emotional, of that morning escape from evil, and Dickens ends the issue rhetorically with "Forth from the city, while it yet slumbered, went the two poor adventures, wandering they knew not whither." 8 Even more notable is the final verso inset of 44/72, picturing the end of the wanderers' journey. Dickens instructed Cattermole about it as follows: The child has been buried inside the church, and the old man, who cannot be made to understand that she is dead, repairs to the grave and sits there all day long, waiting for her arrival, to begin another journey. His staff and knapsack, her little bonnet and basket, etc., lie beside him. "She'll come to-morrow," he says when it gets dark, and goes sorrowfully home. I think an hour-glass running out would help the notion; perhaps her little things upon his knee, or in his hand. I am breaking my heart over this story, and cannot bear to finish it. ( Letters, I, 283-284 ) Cattermole's drawing of this is set near the top of the page, after "When it grew quite dark, he rose and returned home, and went to bed, murmuring to himself, "She will come tomorrow!" The old man sits in the church aisle, as Nell had done in the woodcut for 34/53, among memorial and monumental bric-a-brac which inevitably recalls the Shop lumber. The text reads on below, "Upon the morrow he was there again . . . 'She will come tomorrow!" Tailpieces for issues are equally striking. That at 43/70 will do as an example. The episode is one in which Dickens is deeply involved emotionally (cf. Letters , I, 292-293). He describes the scene in a letter: Kit, the single gentleman, and Mr. Garland go down to the place where the child is, and arrive there at night. There has been a fall of snow. Kit, leaving them behind, runs to the old house, and, with a lanthorn in one hand and the bird in its cage in the other, stops for a moment at a little distance with a natural hesitation before he goes up to make his presence known. In a window — supposed to be that of the child's little room — a light is burning, and in that room the child (unknown, of course, to her visitors, who are full of hope) lies dead. 9 In the weekly unfolding of the story, Nell's fate will be still unknown to readers of issue 43 for which this cut is designed; like "her visitors", they are to be "full of hope". 10 Dickens's outline to Cattermole of what he wants makes it plain that he is deliberately maintaining the suspense. That he wished for secrecy about his final decision is clear from another letter, that to Miss Coutts a month later accompanying a gift of advance copies of the issues for January 23rd and January 30th. These are 43/69-70, with the tailpiece under discussion, and 44/71-72, in which it is revealed that Kit is too late, for Nell is already dead. Dickens writes as follows: It has occurred to me . . . that when you come to read this week's number of the Clock, you might possibly desire to know what the next one contained without waiting seven days. I therefore make bold to send you, inclosed, the two numbers together . . . . Beseeching you to with-hold this mighty revelation from all the World . . . ( Letters , I, 295-296) The "mighty revelation" that Nell is dead, in spite of the "imploring letters", is made at the beginning of 44/71, and marked with yet a third elaborately planned Cattermole drawing, that of her death bed ( Letters , I, 283-284). That Dickens was right in asking Miss Coutts not to give away the finale, and the extent, moreover, of supporting pathos which his woodcuts provided, may be seen in Macready's reaction to the news. He noted in his diary, "Found at home an onward number of Master Humphrey's Clock. I saw one print in it of the dear dead child that gave a dead chill through my blood. I dread to read it, but I must get it over." 11 Another obvious function of the "woodcuts dropped into the text", one shared of course with the plate illustrations in Dickens's Number novels, is to mark the introduction of a new character. In OCS , insets are given on their first entry not only to all the main personages, but to lesser ones such as Mrs Quilp, Swiveller, Brass, the Garlands, all the show-people, Barbara, the schoolmaster, Mrs. Jarley, and the Marchioness. The close connection between words and picture makes it easier for the reader to keep his hold on these folk in spite of the zigzag of the weekly units. Sally Brass, for instance, enters first in 24/33, and is given an inset showing her with her brother at the moment of Quilp's intrusion. She is pictured again in 25/35, eavesdropping at the single gentleman's door, and in 25/36, offering the Marchioness "two square inches of cold mutton" on a fork. 12 On our return to London topics after following Nell's fortunes, we see Sally Brass in 33/51 taking tea at Quilp's and remember her at once, in spite of the two months gap in continuity. Finally, and most importantly, the woodcuts do much to illuminate the thematic contrast which is the real basis of OCS . This may be demonstrated from Forster's words in the Life . Its effect as a mere piece of art . . . I think noteworthy . . . . from the image of little Nell asleep amid the quaint grotesque figures of the old curiosity warehouse, to that other final sleep she takes among the grim forms and carvings of the old church aisle; the main purpose seems to be always present. The characters and incidents that at first appear most foreign to it, are found to have had with it a close relation. The hideous lumber and rottenness that surround the child in her grandfather's home, take shape again in Quilp and his filthy gang. In the first still picture of Nell's innocence in the midst of strange and alien forms, we have the forecast of her after-wanderings, her patient miseries, her sad maturity of experience before its time. Without the showpeople and their blended fictions and realities, their waxworks, dwarfs, giants, and performing dogs, the picture would have wanted some part of its significance. Nor could the genius of Hogarth himself have given it higher expression than in the scenes by the cottage door, the furnace fire, and the burial-place of the old church, over whose tombs and gravestones hang the puppets of Mr. Punch's show while the exhibitors are mending and repairing them. And when, at last, Nell sits within the quiet old church where all her wanderings end, and gazes on those silent monumental groups of warriors, with helmets, swords, and gauntlets wasting away around them; the associations among which her life had opened seem to have come crowding on the scene again, to be present at its close. 13 In this passage, Forster uses the words "scene", "image" and "picture" in their general sense, but it is to be noted that the "pictures" which he recalls are without exception those which are compounded of both words and illustration. To specify, in Forster's order; Nell "asleep amid the quaint grotesque figures of the old curiosity warehouse" is the inset at the end of 4/1; the "other final sleep" is the inset already mentioned in 44/71; the "hideous lumber and rottenness that surround the child in her grandfather's home" are in the headpieces for 4/1 and 12/9. "Quilp and his filthy gang" occupy nearly a quarter of the woodcuts; "the show-people . . . waxworks, dwarfs, giants and performing dogs" are pictured in twelve illustrations of which two, at 17/19 and 22/29, are of headpiece prominence; the "scenes by the cottage door, the furnace fire, and the burial-place of the old church" are at 19/24, 30/44 and 15/16. The "quiet old church" is pictured at 31/46 when the wanderers reach its refuge, and at 34/52 and 53 when we resume their story after a London interlude; at 35/54 we have its graveyard, and at 35/55 Maclise's picture of Nell and the Sexton. Finally, after an interlude of two months, we have the old church again in the tailpiece to 43/70, in the inset in 44/71, and in the final verso inset for 44/72 of the old man's vigil (plates I, IIB, IV). This is a remarkable list; Forster's easy references to Hogarth, moreover, made in his discussion of both OCS and BR , provide further support for the view that no small part of the emotional power of these two novels lay in the visual impact which they made on their first readers. Forster, of course, would have known OCS for its first twenty years in its original Clock form, because no reprint with illustrations beyond token frontispieces appeared until 1861. For that edition, thirteen of the woodcuts noted above were among those chosen as plates by Dickens. Several letters of this time likewise testify to Dickens's appreciation of the tonal effectiveness of his artists' contribution; in January 1841 he speaks of Cattermole's "most invaluable co-operation in the beautiful illustrations", adding, "Believe me that this is the very first time any designs for what I have written have touched and moved me, and caused me to feel that they expressed the idea that I had in my mind." ( Letters , I, 298). Another element which Forster might have remarked in OCS is the exploration of unreality which Dickens makes in the visual opposition between Nell and the artificial images of Mrs Jarley's Waxworks. Like the puppets dangling over the tombstone in 15/16, these figures ape life, though they are of the dead. The grotesquerie of the Shop is thus echoed in other forms, keeping alive through the centre of the novel what the more serious effigies of the knights of old will suggest at the end. The Waxworks are featured in several woodcuts, at 20/26, 21/28, 23/32, 26/37, and in the headpiece for 22/29, described in detail by Dickens for Cattermole. 14 Two final instances may be given of the emotional reinforcement which these "woodcuts dropped into the text" provide. The first is that of 15/15; Nell and her grandfather left London at the end of 13/12, and Dickens resumed their narrative two weeks later. He was pleased with his work here, writing to Forster on June 17, 1840: Number 15, which I began today, I anticipate great things from. There is a description of getting gradually out of town, and passing through neighbourhoods of distinct and various characters, with which, if I had read it as anybody else's writing, I think I should have been very much struck. The child and the old man are on their journey of course, and the subject is a very pretty one. . . . ( Letters , I, 262) Dickens traces their way on that June morning up through Camden Town to the rise of Highgate Hill and Hampstead, where the travellers "looking back at old Saint Paul's looming through the smoke" might feel they had escaped from Inferno. Here the pair rest, and Nell remembers "an old copy of the Pilgrim's Progress, with strange plates, upon a shelf at home." The theme thus touched on, the mood is embodied in a fine woodcut of the scene. The second instance is the death of Quilp, already referred to, in 42/67. Dickens writes this up as a justly terrible end. 15 The river "toyed and sported with its ghastly freight, now bruising it against the slimy piles, now hiding it in mud or long rank grass" until it tossed up "the deserted carcass" on a "dismal place" to bleach away unmourned. This is how villains should die. Nell's very different departure is soon to follow. To mark the significance of his rhetorical evocation, Dickens puts a woodcut as a tailpiece to the chapter, though it is central in the issue. This is the only instance of the strategy in OCS . Phiz was acknowledged to have excelled himself in what Kitton called a "weird waterscape", which rounds off the horrors and heightens the contrast with the "lighted rooms, bright fires, cheerful faces" that await the liberated Kit in the opening sentence of the next chapter. OCS concludes with a tailpiece in issue 45; Master Humphrey then produces the MS of BR , which opens in issue 46 with a Cattermole headpiece of the Maypole Inn, and an initial design of a Maypole. For sales appeal this junction of the two novels is contrived not only in the middle of the weekly issue, but within the monthly Number (issues 45-48 for February 1841). After BR is launched, Dickens resumes the illustrative pattern established in the latter half of OCS : there are two woodcuts to an issue, headpieces and initials being allotted to the openings of the monthly units (at 49/6, 53/13, 58/23, 62/31, 66/39, 71/49, 75/57, 79/65, and 84/75). There are tailpieces or final verso insets for five of the monthly Numbers, and an extra headpiece and initial central in the Number at 63/33. In keeping with its tighter construction, the illustrations for BR are more closely integrated into the narrative movement than those of the earlier novel. Few are of the merely incidental type such as that of Swiveller at the Wackles's ball in OCS 11/8, or Kit at the opera in OCS 27/39. Moreover, Dickens seems now to have become very conscious of the weekly issue and "both the illustrations" as a composite unit. 16 His headpieces, as before, mark key settings or incidents to be dealt with in the text to follow. The Maypole Inn and The Warren preface the issue of their introduction. When the sinister association of Sir John Chester and Hugh is to be revealed in 58/23, the headpiece pictures them drinking together, while the initial design is of a corkscrew. Other headpieces include Joe's parting from Dolly at 62/31, Solomon Daisy's vision of the "ghost" at 63/33, Lord Gordon with the mob at the Commons at 71/49, and the capture of Barnaby at 75/57. At the centre of the novel, there is a striking linkage of issues by means of a tailpiece, headpiece, and initial design. 65/38 ends with a riotous scene at The Boot tavern where Hugh and Dennis drink Lord Gordon's health, and dance "an Extemporaneous No-Popery Dance" pictured in a lively tailpiece. The headpiece for 66/39 pictures Tappertit greeting Hugh while the other rioters continue their caperings, 'No Popery' being scrawled on the wall beside them. The initial depicts tavern gaiety. Obviously, too, in BR , Dickens planned a fuller exploitation of his artists, providing good "subjects" expecially for Phiz, whose talent for violent scenes had already been revealed in the cut in OCS 30/45 depicting a procession of the unemployed, "maddened men, armed with sword and firebrand." Some of these set pieces are comedy, for example the cut of Tappertit and the Prentice Knights in 50/8, but as the drama speeds up the big scenes are crowded and angry. Dickens wrote to Forster early in July 1841, ". . . the story is progressing (I hope you will think) to good strong interest. I have left it, I think, at an exciting point, with a good dawning of the riots" ( Letters , I, 335). The reference is to issues 69/45-46 and 70/47-48, due to appear on July 24th and 31st. Again, on August 6th, he remarks, "the best opportunities of illustration are all coming off now, and we are in the thick of the story," and on the 11th, "I think you'll find that it comes out strong to the last word." 17 His letters pour out a torrent of detail for Cattermole and Browne, whose excited response may be seen in the fine sequence of woodcuts from 71/49 onwards. The Moorfields bonfires at 72/52, the looted Maypole bar at 73/54, the mob storming Newgate at 78/64, the rioters looting a house at 79/66, the rabble's orgy at 80/68 are all superb "subjects", as well as being emotionally keyed to the high pitch of the narrative (plate IIIB). ( Letters , I, 342, 346-347, 349). As in OCS , characters are given visual status at their first introduction. The second inset of the book brings in Old John, Joe, the Stranger, and the rustic chorus listening to Solomon Daisy's tale of Rudge in the bar of the Maypole. The Raven merits a headpiece entry at 49/6, where we also first see Ned Chester. 18 The Vardens appear in the comedy cut of 48/4, and constantly thereafter; Tappertit and Miggs make comic solo entrances at 48/4 and 50/9. That smooth villain Sir John Chester is pictured eight times, always with characteristic detail. One example of this will do, the cut at 62/32 which shows him telling his son Ned destructive lies about Emma Haredale. He lounges at ease, a volume of Lord Chesterfield's Letters open beside him, while on the wall behind him, facing the viewer, is a picture of Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac. This scene is given visual emphasis because it marks an important stage in Dickens's narrative, the end of his preliminary plotting. Joe has gone off to the wars in the preceding chapter, and now Ned is to be parted from Emma, after which, says Dickens, "the world went on turning round, as usual, for five years, concerning which this narrative is silent." Sir John Chester may be only a theatrical villain, but he has a key role, and has to be kept in view right up to the moment of his exit in the tailpiece duel of 87/81. Hugh, Dennis and Barnaby of course are given many illustrations. Hugh has a solo entry at 51/11, and appears frequently after this, his most striking illustration being that at 85/77, in which he curses the Tyburn gallows, "that black tree," of which he is "the ripened fruit." Lord George Gordon is another personage whom Dickens wished to make memorable. "As to the riot, I am going to try if I can't make a better one than he did" he wrote in June 1841 ( Letters , I, 324). Gordon enters the story at the opening of its historical second half, in 64/35, where he is depicted with Gashford in that best room at the Maypole which readers have already met in several insets. Next we see him, still with Gashford, on Westminister Bridge in 70/48, urging Barnaby to join his assembly. Dickens has been preparing carefully for this moment, where the confrontation of his two "madmen" conflates his plot lines and sets up ironic echoes. Barnaby has been told that riches are to be found in crowds. 19 Meeting therefore with the hurrying throng on their way to St. George's Fields, he is only too eager to go with them. It needs only the words from Gordon "and you desire to make one of this great body?" for him to break away from his mother's control. Dickens marks the moment with one of Phiz's best cuts, inset after Mrs Rudge's words, "In mercy's name, my lord, go your way alone, and do not tempt him into danger!" (plate VI). Gordon then appears again in the headpiece at 71/49, and finally "alone and very solitary, in his prison in the Tower" in 83/73 ( Letters , I, 349-350). In addition to the functions so far noted, the BR illustrations are employed to mark dramatic incident, promote tension, climax surprise, or set up a contrast. The melodrama of the Rudge-Haredale plot is highlighted visually throughout the novel, from the moment we see the mysterious Stranger striking down Joe Willet at 47/2, to the conventional Recognition Scene between father and son given the prominence of a final verso inset at 77/62. The combined effect of these elements in the BR woodcuts is remarkable. For one thing, the drawings themselves are stronger than most of those in OCS . For another, Dickens was thinking to some extent pictorially, and deliberately providing fine opportunities for his artists. Finally, these BR woodcuts are set into the text with precision; again and again they strengthen the impact of the words, or mark a moment of structural significance. Clearly Dickens had developed a very satisfactory technique for that special partnership of print and picture for which the weekly periodical of those times offered a great opportunity. It is a pity he was never again to use the mode. So far my investigation has assumed that the woodcuts "dropped into the text" in the Clock were, in fact, placed in their exact positions by Dickens himself, not casually manipulated by the printer. The evidence supporting this view is partly in the Letters with their detailed instructions, 20 and partly in the surviving proofs and MSS. In addition to letters already noted, this further one illuminates Dickens's methods. Writing to Hall on September 14, 1841, he notes "Gate of Newgate in 78; not in 79. I don't want Barnaby in the subject. I feared he might be there . . . . When you get the riot block will you send me a proof of it?" ( Letters , I, 352). The 'Gate of Newgate' is inset in 78/64 following the words 'both caught the locksmith roughly in their grasp.' The proof sheets and MSS in the Forster collection reveal that Dickens gave specific instructions to his printers as well as to his artists, and that they did what they were told whenever typographically possible. The evidence here is of two kinds: the MS of BR carries a number of specific instructions to the printer in Dickens's writing, while the proof sheets of OCS carry similar instructions in Forster's writing. Since we know that Forster was Dickens's helper and consultant throughout the Clock 's run, it may be assumed that the placings which he marked in for the woodcuts were those which Dickens himself had indicated in discussion or in correspondence now lost. To take the proof sheets of OCS first, then, on the assumption that Forster was Dickens's practical agent in the matter. His method is to draw a line indicating the place for the break, and write in the words "cut", or "cut here", in the margin. The instructions for the placing of cuts in 24/33 (Quilp thrusts in his head), 31/46 (Nell admires the church), 34/53 (Nell sitting in the church aisle, plates II A &amp; B), 39/62 (Quilp beats the figurehead), and 39/63 (Swiveller bears off Kit's mother) have been followed exactly. In several instances in OCS and BR , however, the printed text offers a different placing from that which was indicated. Textual alterations apart, the reason may be seen in the marginal note to the inset in 34/53. The page is reproduced in Plate II A; the first idea, represented by the short cancelled line, was to insert the cut after "their" in the sentence "Broken and dilapidated as they were, they yet retained their ancient form. . . ." But Forster was not sure whether in this position the cut would lie well on the page. Three times in the early issues of OCS a cut (other than a tailpiece) had been allowed to fall to the very bottom of the page, in 4/1, 9/5, and 18/21; the visual effect was markedly unsatisfactory, and there are no later instances. Reconsidering, then, his note for the inset in 34/53, Forster draws another line, not very conclusively, under the earlier words "of warriors stretched upon their bed of stone with folded hands, crosslegged", and pens in the margin the instruction "Cut here but place it so as to leave 2 or 3 lines at the bottom of the 11th page or more if it will allow of it." The printer, however, was able to follow the first suggestion, inserting the cut after "their", and leaving three and a half lines below it to the bottom of the page, which is the eleventh, the final recto. In this position, the illustration dominates the page, giving visual strength to the verbal impression (plate II B). Practical considerations of this kind have governed the changes of position of the final verso inset in 36/57, in which Swiveller and the Marchioness play cards, and the final recto inset of the Marchioness and Mr. Abel in 40/65. Sometimes a cut indicated as an inset has been used as a headpiece, sometimes a headpiece is noted in as such. The MS of BR , however, offers firmer ground for argument, since in addition to all the other evidence we have of Dickens's deliberate planning of his illustrations, we have here his own directions to the printer. Specific instructions in the form "Printer, put the cut here" or "Printer cut here" occur at 79/66, 80/67, 80/68, 81/69, and 81/70. The words that precede the inset of Gordon's meeting with Barnaby in 70/48 have been underlined in red ink, possibly for the artist, possibly for the printer (plate VI). Of the cuts for which direct instructions are given, the first three are inset in the Clock exactly where Dickens indicated; they are the final verso inset of the mob looting a house (plates III A &amp; B), Joe's rescue of Haredale, and the final verso inset of the rabble's orgy. At 81/69 the cut of Hugh as prisoner has been advanced, at 81/70 that of Dennis and Miggs has been delayed, in order to balance the Clock page, as in the OCS examples. This evidence, fragmentary though it is, supports the thesis that Dickens not only planned which aspects of his story should be given visual emphasis, often writing with pictorial possibilities in mind, but selected also the positions in which the "woodcuts dropped into the text" would be most effective. In several instances he negotiated for "a block of a peculiar shape", or "a block of a long shape", in order to give some special effect, such as that of having the locksmith's house "come upright as it were" in the illustrations he outlined to Cattermole ( Letters , I, 299, 344). It is clearly this adaptability which Dickens had in mind when he referred to his method as an "improvement" upon "separate plates". Any reader lucky enough to know OCS and BR , as Forster did, in the original Clock format, will be delighted with its happy and illuminating marriage of word and image. Thus OCS and BR stand alone in Dickens's works, exhibiting a closer relationship between text and illustration then he ever attempted elsewhere. For twenty years, the only illustrated edition before the public was the original one. Its composite unity was not destroyed until the Illustrated Library Edition of the Works in 1861, which as was noted at the beginning of this paper abandoned the inset woodcuts and offered instead a selection of plates. Thirty-two cuts from each novel were chosen, given captions, engraved as separate plates, and inserted at the relevant pages which were listed at the beginning of each volume. Since their relevance to the weekly or monthly units was over, some of the headpieces and tailpieces chosen were inserted instead as plates facing the text of their exact reference. All the sixty-four plates in the two novels were as accurately placed in context as the new procedure allowed. All but three were engraved sideways, an awkward method which had begun with the Dombey plates. From 1867 onwards Dickens issued a revised edition of his Works , the Charles Dickens Edition , with eight plates only to each novel; these are placed in context as before. It is clear then that Dickens recognized the need for flexibility in the republication of these two novels, and was prepared to adapt his methods to new circumstances. For the Cheap Edition of 1848-49 and the Library Edition of 1858, he provided frontispieces (only) for both novels. For the Cheap Edition he also authorized the separate issue of extra plates, four to each novel, and took advantage of the opportunity offered of modifying the original conceptions where it seemed advisable. Thus the Marchioness is romanticised, in keeping with the person she became by the end of the run of OCS , rather than with the grotesque little slavey whom Phiz was asked to visualize in 25/36 in September 1840. Similarly, Dolly Varden is given a more romantic and attractive image. Phiz also elaborated upon Nell's deathbed scene, picturing her this time with upraised finger hearkening to the angelic choir. Nevertheless, for all illustrations which in his lifetime Dickens chose for issue in close association with the text, he preserved the strictest textual relevancy compatible with the changed requirements. After his death, Chapman and Hall attempted in the 1873-76 Illustrated Library Edition to give OCS and BR something of their original style by using insets. Subsequent editions have reverted to plates. As time has passed, illustrated reprints of OCS and BR have moved progressively further from the originals. To demonstrate the lamentable condition of affairs today it will be sufficient to examine the current New Oxford Illustrated Dickens . This edition, according to the statement on the jacket of each novel, offers "the original drawings which appeared in the first edition." These words would suggest that the copy was that of 1841. This is not so. Where the illustrations are those appearing only in 1841, the 1841 settings are mostly disregarded. Where the illustrations were chosen and placed in 1861 or 1868 by Dickens, those settings, too, are disregarded, as well as those of 1841. With a fine independence, the New Oxford illustrations have seldom any relevance whatever to the context in which they are placed. The most that can be said is that the original sequence of 1841 is preserved. There is no explanation of the policy adopted, no recognition that any editorial or textual problem exists. To take OCS first. All its woodcuts except the initial designs are included, a total of seventy-five. Only one is upright. Of these seventy-five, thirty-six have been set out of context, while eleven more, though inserted at the correct page opening, are turned with their blank backs to the words to which they refer. In eight instances, cuts have been moved so far away from their words that they are not even in the issue for which Dickens designed them. One cut was moved by Dickens himself in 1861, that of Nell in her bed at the end of 4/1. He put it into 12/9 as "The Child's Bedchamber", facing the scene where she sobs herself to sleep. The New Oxford editor captions it "The Child in her Gentle Slumber", and puts it in 7/2 irrelevantly opposite the scene between the old man and Swiveller. Four of the misplacements occur at critical points. The cut of Nell and her grandfather leaving the Shop at the end of 13/12 is set in 14/13, in an episode concerned with Quilp and Kit (plate V). Nell sitting "within the quiet old church where all her wanderings end" as Forster put it, at the end of 34/53 (plate II A &amp; B), is an illustration which Dickens chose in 1861 and 1868, placing it accurately with the original words. The New Oxford puts it a chapter and an issue later in 35/54. Kit's arrival at the old church, "full of hope", in the tailpiece to 43/70 is ruinously delayed in the New Oxford to 44/71. Finally, Quilp's death, which Dickens used in 1861 in its original place at the end of 42/67 and in 1868 set opposite the same passage, is advanced eight pages to the beginning of the chapter. Among the illustrations which are spoilt because they are backed to their text may be mentioned the puppet menders in 15/16, and the two major pictures of Nell's deathbed and the old man's vigil in 44/71 and 44/72. These were also chosen as plates in 1861, and there correctly set facing their context. Indeed, among many more, all the illustrations so vividly impressed upon Forster's mind in the extract quoted from the Life have been subjected to misplacements sufficient to blur or destroy their tonal or narrative effect. Matters are worse in BR . The New Oxford edition offers us seventy-six illustrations, the initial designs being as before excluded. Of these seventy-six, thirteen are correctly faced to their text, while three more are, as it might be put, correctly backed to it. The remaining sixty illustrations are misplaced, in most cases very damagingly indeed. Forty have been transferred to different chapters, twenty of these being in different issues from those planned for them. Unhappily, perhaps, for the argument here, the "Gate of Newgate" has been put "in 78; not in 79", as Dickens insisted to Hall. But it is in 78/63, a chapter before the gate is attacked, not in its Clock place of 78/64. Dickens himself moved three illustrations for his 1861 edition of BR , as well as making the normal movement of headpieces already discussed. 21 Of the insets, he advanced the picture of Hugh asleep from chapter xi, the moment of his physical entry into the tale, to chapter x, where he is first mentioned, sleeping "so desperate hard." He moved Cattermole's drawing of the Boot tavern from 72/52 forward to illustrate the first mention of it in 65/38, a place he retained for it in 1868. He moved the drawing of the Maypole State Bed from its original position as tailpiece to 57/22, where it is relevant to a simile, forward to the end of chapter xii, where it illustrates the concluding sentence. For these three alterations of placing, then, Dickens had excellent reasons. The New Oxford edition also moves these three drawings, but follows neither the 1841 nor the 1861 settings. The confusion resulting from these changes may be appreciated from the following examples. It is no defence to say that a page reference is usually given, because readers are human, and take their pictures as they come to them. If a picture is earlier than its context, they do not refrain from looking at it; if it is later than its context, they can have no prevision that it is to come. Comedy appears in tragedy, surprises dribble away, characterisation is left visually unsupported, climaxes misfire. The following examples are representative of the sixty misplacements in BR . Haredale's intervention between Emma and Ned in 53/14 is a chapter too soon in 53/13; Joe's goodbye to Dolly in 62/31 is two chapters and an issue late in 63/33; Gordon and his associates enter not in 64/35 but two chapters and an issue late in 65/37; the No Popery dance tailpiece to 65/38 is moved to 66/39 while its partnered headpiece is moved to 66/40; the cut of Gordon meeting Barnaby in 70/48 is a chapter and an issue late in 71/49; the cut of the mob looting a house in 79/66 is set a chapter too soon in 79/65; the cut of the rabble's drunken orgy in 80/68 is set a chapter too soon in 80/67 at the spot where Joe rescues Haredale, while that cut is set eight pages earlier, before its episode begins. One crucial scene in BR is the clash in Westminster Hall between Haredale, Chester and Gashford. Here Dickens brings together his melodrama and his history, and he allotted to it in the Clock both the illustrations for the issue, in the one chapter, 68/43. The New Oxford edition splits the pair up, putting the cut of the confrontation of the three enemies several pages too late to illustrate it, while the cut of the meleé that results is delayed for an issue and two chapters to 69/45, where it irrelevantly adorns the description of widow Rudge's cottage. This is not an attack on the New Oxford Illustrated Dickens in particular, but on the whole attitude of our time to the texts of nineteenth-century fiction; " New Oxford " stands for many, many editions since Dickens's death. The reader of today using even a prestige text such as this can have no idea what Dickens's illustrations really did accomplish. Perhaps something of the original impression may be recovered for him by an examination of some New Oxford pages where the setting is correct. Such are: OCS pages 116, 196, 280, 447, 514, and BR 132, 192, and 409. The last is a particularly good example of the original effect, since the plate is engraved upright, as well as facing its context. Whatever the publishing pressures which have led editors to disregard so flagrantly the plan on which OCS and BR were built, the result is deplorable. Doubtless we can not hope now for pages with "woodcuts dropped into the text", but if we must make do with "separate plates", is it too much to ask that they be engraved upright as in the first edition, and inserted facing the exact words they were originally designed to illustrate? Could Dickens see today's texts, he might well burst forth as he did about one of the Dombey cuts, "I can't say what pain and vexation it is to be so utterly misrepresented." 22 TABLE OF OCS AND BR IN THE ISSUES AND NUMBERS OF MHC MHC issues 1,2,3,4 ( OCS Chapter 1) = No. 1, April 1840 .

Walter Dexter, I, 245-246 (hereafter cited as Letters ). 2 Hereafter the monthly unit will be referred to as "Number" to distinguish it from the weekly "issue". See Table of Issues appended. 3 The opening of chapter xlvii reveals Dickens's awareness of his difficulty: "Kit's mother and the single gentleman — upon whose track it is expedient to follow with hurried steps, lest this history should be chargeable with inconstancy, and the offence of leaving its characters in situations of uncertainty and doubt . . . ." 4 Hereafter the issue number and chapter number will be given conventionally, in the form 34/53, i.e., chapter liii in issue 34. 5 The "old gateway" was intended as an architectural subject for Cattermole.

Letters , I, 254, "I mean to make much of him [Swiveller]", and I, 282-283, "I am glad you like Dick and the Marchioness in that sixty-fourth chapter — I thought you would." 7 This is the only drawing Maclise did for the Clock , and is designed to strengthen the foreshadowing of Nell's death. The degree of Dickens's concern that it should be emotionally adequate may be seen in his two letters to Forster in November 1840, Letters , I, 277. See also Letters, I, 278, "I am inundated with imploring letters recommending poor little Nell to mercy." (The current issue was then issue 34.) 8 Cf.

Dickens himself made some of these ideas more explicit in the passage added to the book form of OCS at the end of chapter 1, "I sat down . . . and pictured the child alone . . . . She seemed to exist in a kind of allegory . . ." (to the end of the penultimate sentence of the chapter). 15 Dickens noted that "Quilp's last appearance on any stage . . . is casting its shadow upon my mind." Letters , I, 282-283. 16 He refers several times to "a number and both the illustrations." Forster op cit , I, 142. 17 Letters , I, 343-345. Dickens used the word 'number' for both weekly and monthly units. Here he is referring to the weekly unit, or "issue." At the dates of these last two letters, the issues before readers were: 70/47-48, July 31; 71/49-50, August 7; and 72/51-52, August 14. Dickens refers, of course, to issues soon to appear; he was usually some three weeks ahead with his writing. 18 Cf. "If you [Cattermole] would like to have the raven's first appearance . . . .

      <field name="heading_text">Two 'New' Texts of Thomas Hardy's The Woodlanders by Dale Kramer</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A textual matter concerning the American publication of one of Thomas Hardy's best novels opens new areas for Hardy investigations and for studies of nineteenth-century publishing practices. Two "American" texts of The Woodlanders constitute separate stages of composition of that novel; they do not correspond precisely to the manuscript nor to any version ever published in England. The value of this fact, beyond its usefulness to bibliographers, lies in the new insights its explanation provides into Hardy's novel-writing and revising methods. Hardy scholars have long known of five printed versions of The Woodlanders, and they have assumed that what they considered the first printed version [text number 4 in the list below] reproduces the manuscript. 1 While the present study primarily deals with two previously unidentified printed texts, it also reveals the manuscript to be a separate version. The following table lists all eight of the now-known versions in the order of the novel's evolution, with explanatory comments. 1. The manuscript, in the Dorset County Museum, Dorchester, England. 2. Harper's Bazar text; weekly installments from May 15, 1886, to April 9, 1887; published in New York. 3. Harper &amp; Brothers book version, published in New York in one volume on March 25, 1887. 2 4. Macmillan's Magazine text, published in monthly installments in London from May, 1886, to April, 1887. 5. English first edition, published by Macmillan and Co. of London in three volumes on March 15, 1887. 6. The "Second Edition," the first English one-volume edition, published in London in August, 1887, by Macmillan and Co. 7. The text of The Woodlanders published in 1896 by Osgood, McIlvaine &amp; Co. of London as Volume VII of the first collected edition of Hardy, Thomas Hardy's Works: The Wessex Novels . This collected edition is usually called the "Osgood edition" to distinguish it from the next edition in this listing. 8. The definitive text, Volume VI of Prose of Macmillan and Co's The Works of Thomas Hardy in Prose and Verse (Wessex Edition) of 1912. It is this edition that is legitimately referred to as "the Wessex Edition." This article deals with the first four texts, which are referred to as the manuscript, Harper's Bazar , Harper book, and Macmillan's Magazine . It should be noted, for emphasis, that the middle two are the unique texts. These two hitherto unidentified texts were both published in America and both represent early stages in the novel's evolution, thereby pointing to an interesting if not unprecedented bibliographical oddity. The English first edition [text number 5] is the first edition only in date of publication; the American first edition, published ten days later, contains an earlier version of the text. Hardy, as the list above suggests, seldom let a new setting of type slip by without offering a number of reworked passages to the printers. And while he did not read the proof sheets which were made by the American printers, he did supply the copy from which the American texts were set up. A brief digression will show how and why this was accomplished. Hardy customarily arranged for simultaneous publication of his novels in England and in the United States. In the case of The Woodlanders , he sold the rights of serialization and domestic book issue in each country to a major publishing house — Macmillan &amp; Co. in England and Harper &amp; Brothers in America. The economic necessity for simultaneous publication of The Woodlanders is an essential factor in the formation of the unique American texts. Before 1891 there was no copyright protection in the United States for works first published in England. Any publisher in America could reprint British books or magazines without obtaining the permission either of the author or of the original publisher. Throughout the nineteenth century, such writers as Charles Dickens, Anthony Trollope, Disraeli, and Wilkie Collins felt the loss of thousands of pounds in royalties from this piracy. Under these conditions, it was important for J. Henry Harper, Hardy's authorized American publisher of The Woodlanders , to be able to place on sale his weekly Harper's Bazar and — at the end of the serialization — a bound edition of The Woodlanders before the omnipresent and highly efficient American pirates of the publishing profession could produce cut-rate competitors after obtaining a copy of Macmillan's Magazine , which arrived in New York via steamship a short time after being printed in London. Since a pirating publisher was able to sell a book under his own imprint within thirty-six hours after obtaining a copy whose pages he could distribute among a crew of compositors, not only days but hours were crucial elements in obtaining priority of publication. To gain the the slight but important edge in priority of publication, as well as to be honest in a very basic way, the more reputable American publishers arranged with an English author to be furnished pre-publication copy. Hardy's usual procedure under the terms of the arrangement with his American publisher was to send to America advance proof sheets of his English serialization. 3 On page 85 of Hardy in America Weber prints a letter in which Hardy proposes such a method for The Woodlanders to Thomas Bailey Aldrich, editor of the Atlantic Monthly ; Aldrich rejected the offer but Harper obviously acceded to a similar offer. The same variation from the manuscript in all of the English and American printed versions indicates that this method, rather than sending longhand copies as in the case of Two on a Tower (whose initial appearance was as a serial in the Atlantic ), was used for The Woodlanders . At one point, the manuscript contains an addition without the use of a caret: trees of from the later harvest (fol. 236), which is printed as "from the trees of later harvest" (p. 210). Judging from the position of the addition and the spacing of the words in the manuscript (the words "the" and "later" are joined by the pen-stroke) as well as from the sense of the phrase, "from trees of the later harvest" is what was intended. Had The Woodlanders gone to America in duplicate manuscripts, this phrase would probably have been correctly written out by Hardy or his wife Emma in a single line; but as it is, the original typesetter's error has never been corrected. Hardy once a month sent manuscript sheets from his home in Dorchester to the Macmillan printers in London, who set them in type and sent several sets of the resulting proof sheets to Hardy. Until now, it has been assumed by Hardy scholars either that the English publisher sent the proof sheets to America or that for each novel Hardy corrected and revised a set of proofs to be returned to his English publisher, and that he copied verbatim those corrections and revisions onto another set of proofs which was sent in monthly packets to his authorized American publisher. But in at least the case of The Woodlanders , Hardy's pre-publication revising was more elaborate. Because of the lack of international copyright, the sheets for Harper's Bazar had to be sent hastily, so Hardy had time to make only a small number of revisions, which, naturally, he or Emma copied onto the other sets of proof sheets. Hardy sent a second set of advance proof sheets, on which he had made further revisions, to America under separate cover as a precaution against the possibility that the first set might be missent or lost. 4 But even the second set could not be revised carefully enough to satisfy the conscientious and artistically restless Hardy, since in sending the second set of proofs promptness still had to be the primary consideration. So, after dispatching both sets of proof sheets to America, Hardy made further revisions on a third set before returning that set to the Macmillan printers for the forthcoming monthly issue of Macmillan's Magazine . The result, then, of Hardy's penchant for revision, the lack of international copyright, and the vicissitudes of transatlantic mail service, was this: Harper's Bazar set up its pages from the first set of proofs, the Harper book printers used the second set, and Macmillan's Magazine used the third set. No correspondence or memorandum remains to show whether the Harper printers realized that the two sets of proof sheets that Hardy sent had differing author's revisions and corrections; most probably, the book's printers were sent the second set by Harper's editors solely for the sake of convenience. The evidence of the above assertions concerning the uniqueness of the American texts rests upon a comparison of four versions of The Woodlanders : the manuscript, the Harper's Bazar text, the Harper book text, and the Macmillan's Magazine text. In the first of several sections devoted to particular sorts of variants, I contrast variants in Harper's Bazar with the corresponding passages in the manuscript. Next, I discuss distinctions between the two American texts. Then, I cover differences between the Harper book and Macmillan's Magazine . A section pointing out passages that were revised more than once in the four versions follows. Drawing upon these sections for illustrations, the conclusion proves that the American texts' variants were authored by Hardy; the conclusion also summarizes the primary findings of the comparison of the four versions, and points out the signifiance of this study to an understanding of Hardy's art. This might be the best place to mention in passing the pirated text of The Woodlanders sold by H. C. Munro &amp; Co., New York, April 16, 1887, reprinted by A. L. Burt in 1895, and by Munro again in 1898. I have checked only 1898 and 1895 copies, but I presume that Munro always used the same plates. If this belief is accurate, Burt's volume is either a sub-edition or a re-issue of Munro's. This is a tentative ascription, since there were at least eleven other pirating publishers of The Woodlanders , but Munro's first edition bears the earliest date of the pirates. Weber's "Tragedy in Little Hintock," pp. 151-153, contains a check-list of the pirated — as well as the authorized — American printings of The Woodlanders . The complexity of the American bibliography is increased by the knowledge that the pirated edition itself comprises a unique text. Both Macmillan's Magazine and Harper's Bazar were raided by the pirating printers, who set up their type from the June-August, 1887, installments of Macmillan's Magazine (Chapters V-XVIII) while using Harper's Bazar for the rest of the text. Contrary to another general assumption, then, the pirates did not wait for the English first edition to arrive in America before setting to work. Since the focus of this study is on Hardy's habits of revision, the pirated printings were not exhaustively checked and are not discussed here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Since the proof sheets sent to the American magazine received only a cursory revision by Hardy in the necessity to meet deadlines, there are but occasional differences between Harper's Bazar and the manuscript. Moreover, the variants that mark differences between the manuscript and Harper's Bazar also mark differences between the manuscript and the Harper book text. (The only exception to this generalization reflects Hardy's reluctance to offend Victorian readers: it is discussed in a more pertinent context in the next section of this paper.) Hardy, in other words, did not alter in the second set of proofs any of the revisions he made while working on the first set. Therefore, the variants I am discussing in this section are in both Harper's Bazar and the Harper book text; these variants are common Harper variants when compared to corresponding passages in the manuscript. Of course, the Harper book text has additional revisions. The book edition's other variants, which make it a different text than Harper's Bazar and which establish it as the second American version, are covered in the next section of this article. Only a few improvements were made in time to be included in Harper's Bazar . In one of the few additions of humor that Hardy worked into his Harper's Bazar revisions, Marty South dryly comments to herself after Giles tells her that his houses are only life-holdings and will someday become Mrs. Charmond's, "They are going to keep company with my hair" (p. 38) — the hair she had sold to a barber to be made into a wig for the rich and fashionable Mrs. Charmond. Another improvement, the substitution of "gentleness that might hinder sufficient self-expression for her own good" for "latent sauciness that might never actually show itself," more clearly connotes Grace's placid lack of independence (p. 42). A more important change than most of those affecting the Harper's Bazar text removes the manuscript's identification of Felice Charmond as "the daughter of an eminent painter" who might, if she wished, have claimed more merit than falls to people merely possessing family antiquity. In place of this artistic background, Harper's Bazar ascribes to her an "adaptable, wandering weltbürgerliche nature" (p. 69). Also, the manuscript's reference to Grace as "this gentle young girl" becomes in Harper's Bazar "this gentle acquaintance [of Mrs. Charmond's]" (p. 70). The last two sentences of the last paragraph of Chapter XXX, which describes Melbury's indecision to ask Mrs. Charmond to cease flirting with his son-in-law, first appear in Harper's Bazar : For days he sat in a moody attitude over the fire, a pitcher of cider standing on the hearth beside him, and his drinking-horn inverted upon the top of it. He spent a week and more thus, composing a letter to the chief offender [Mrs. Charmond], which he would every now and then attempt to complete and suddenly crumple up in his hand (pp. 267-268). Another added paragraph portrays Grace hearing "a faint noise among the trees, resembling a cough" during the first day she is at Giles's cabin after fleeing from her husband Fitzpiers (p. 369). This addition provides the first indication that Hardy gives to Grace that Giles is ill, even though she does not consciously link the sound with disease until the evening of the following day when she hears Giles deliriously talking to himself in the rain-soaked shelter he has made for himself out of hurdles and thatches after giving up his hut to Grace. The conjunction "if" enters a sentence in Harper's Bazar to clarify a set of modifiers: "'Grace!' said Fitzpiers in an indescribable whisper — more than invocating — if not quite deprecatory" (p. 386; italics mine). Another minor grammatical correction that was made first in Harper's Bazar was the substitution of "it" for "them" in the sentence, "Fitzpiers discerned a gay procession of people coming down the way, and was not long in perceiving it to be a wedding-party" (p. 407). Also, in the early pages of the manuscript Giles has been called "Ambrose;" this is corrected to "Giles" twice (pp. 32, 34) although in two other places the appellation remains "Ambrose" (pp. 13, 30). (In several of the early pages of both the manuscript and the Harper text, Giles is correctly named.) The name of the man who keeps a ciderhouse is changed from "Aaron" to "Farmer" Cawtree (p. 27). Interestingly, other evidences of the evolution of characters' names are unchanged from the manuscript: Robert Creedle in one passage retains an earlier Christian name, "Lot" (p. 31); and the first appearance of Suke Damson is as "Suke Sengreen" (p. 176). These remnants of earlier names are corrected in Macmillan's Magazine .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The variant passages that are common to both Harper's Bazar and the Harper book edition have been pointed out. This section offers substantiation for the major assertion of this paper: that there exist two American versions of The Woodlanders , in stages of composition between the manuscript and the English serial. The Harper's Bazar text is only slightly advanced beyond the manuscript, because Hardy had to send the first set of proofs to America quickly. It naturally contains a few oversights, which are corrected in the Harper book text. For example, in the manuscript and Harper's Bazar , Fitzpiers includes Fortitude, Discretion, Wisdom, and Love in Schleiermacher's list of cardinal virtues, and Grace thinks that Giles has not much discretion; in the Harper book text, the cardinal virtues are Self-control, Perseverance, Wisdom, and Love, and it is perseverance that Grace thinks is lacking in Giles (p. 167). Also, Fitzpiers' reaction toward finding Grace in the man-trap set by Tim Tangs is made more appropriate. In the manuscript and Harper's Bazar , the statement is "Although he had never seen a mantrap before, Fitzpiers could not help perceiving that this instrument was one." Probably recalling that earlier in the novel he had described the late Mr. Charmond's collection of man-traps (p. 67), and that Fitzpiers often had been in Hintock House both as physician and lover, Hardy in the second set of proofs changed the above statement to "Fitzpiers had often studied the effect of these instruments when examining the collection at Hintock House" (p. 430). Several other readings first enter the novel in the Harper book text. For example, in the manuscript and Harper's Bazar , Melbury had known that the lawyer Beaucock had written to Giles informing him that a divorce for Grace from Fitzpiers is impossible to obtain. The passage in Harper's Bazar reads: "Then Giles did not tell you [that a divorce is unobtainable]?" said Melbury. "No," said she. "He could not have known it." Her father suspected the accuracy of this, for he knew that Beaucock had written. But he said nothing, and Grace went away to the solitude of her chamber. Melbury's explicit knowledge is deleted for the Harper book text and is not in any of the English texts: "Then Giles did not tell you?" said Melbury. "No," said she. "He could not have known it. His behaviour to me proved that he did not know." Her father said nothing more, and Grace went away to the solitude of her chamber (p. 354). When Grace runs away from home upon Fitzpiers' return from the Continent, she originally left empty-handed; but beginning in the Harper book text, she "gathered a few toilet necessaries into a handbag" before slipping out of the back door (p. 359). Again, Melbury's search-party learns that the man accompanying Grace had been "holding her tight" in the manuscript and Harper's Bazar ; this phrase changes to "clutching her tight" in the Harper book text (p. 436). The description of Fitzpiers and Grace which Melbury obtains from other strollers is altered in other details for the Harper book text, but considerations of space prohibit recounting all of the alterations here. Some of the most bibliographically challenging remnants of the second set of proof sheets are several passages in the Harper book text which are in no other text of The Woodlanders — that is, passages which Hardy wrote onto the second set of proofs but which were not transferred to the third set of proof sheets, the one which was sent to Macmillan's Magazine . For example, after murmuring a few lines from Congreve (which are in the manuscript, the American and English serials, and the Harper book text but not in any English book text or the definitive text), Fitzpiers apostrophizes the playwright in the italicized sentence below, which appears only in the Harper book text: ". . . Why do I never recognize an opportunity till I have missed it, nor the good or ill of a step till it is irrecovable! . . . I fell in love . . . . Love, indeed! — "'Love's but the frailty of the mind When 'tis not with ambition joined; A sickly flame which, if not fed, expires, And feeding, wastes in self-consuming fires!" Ah, old author of 'The Way of the World,' you knew — you knew !" Grace moved. He thought she had heard some part of his soliloquy (p. 263). Another passage unique to the Harper book text describes Mrs. Charmond as she receives Melbury on the morning he has come to question her about her relationship with his son-in-law. The italicized portion is the unique Harper book passage: "Do sit down, Mr. Melbury. You have felled all the trees that were to be purchased by you this season, except the oaks, I believe." " Yes," said Melbury . " How very nice ! It must be so charming to work in the woods just now !" She was too careless to affect an interest in an extraneous person's affairs so consummately as to deceive in the manner of the perfect social machine . Hence her words "very nice," "so charming," were uttered with a perfunctoriness that made them sound absurdly unreal . "Yes, yes," said Melbury, in a reverie (p. 278). Again, the phrase "something like" exists only in the Harper book text in the phrase "in what seemed something like her own voice grown ten years older" (p. 293); and in the Harper book text alone, Melbury once describes his hair as "gray" in his plea to Grace not to let it be publicly known that she has spent three nights in Giles's hut (even though Giles had not been there): "Then why should you by a piece of perverseness bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave?" (p. 392). The number of differences between Harper's Bazar and the Harper book edition increases as the novel progresses. Until the revision of Schleiermacher's list of cardinal virtues on page 167, which occurs shortly after the beginning of the fifth monthly installment, the two American texts are nearly identical; but after this point the texts vary, sometimes considerably. In a count based on the quantity of material in the monthly divisions in Macmillan's Magazine [transplanted to weekly Harper's Bazar portions and to the Harper book edition], the Harper book edition has an average of more than twenty readings different from the Harper's Bazar text in each of the eighth, ninth, tenth, and twelfth monthly sections. Evidently, as Hardy neared the end of writing The Woodlanders , he felt he had more time to devote to the second reading of proof sheets to be sent to America. In this and in the preceding sections I have given a number of reasons for believing that Hardy sent more than one set of advance proof sheets to America as a precaution against loss, one set being used by the printers employed by Harper's Bazar , the second set by the printers setting up the type for the Harper book edition. Hardy, who apparently never wearied of reading his own work, corrected and revised the two sets separately. Awareness of this procedure makes possible a logical explanation for a textual variant that commentators on Hardy's American publications have pointed out but have not been able to explain. The suggestive sentence concluding Fitzpiers' first seduction of Suke — "It was daybreak before Fitzpiers and Suke Damson re-ëntered Little Hintock" (p. 178) — is in Harper's Bazar while it is absent from the authorized American book edition published by Harper and from Macmillan's Magazine . (It is in the edition published by the pirates, who lifted this portion of the text from Harper's Bazar .) Hardy's career-long difficulties in communicating the earthy aspects of life to a prudish Victorian society whose family reading came largely in the form of serial fiction are well-known. Hardy, in his forthright desire to earn a living with his fiction, acquiesced as far as he was able to the demands of his editors to underplay the sexual element of his novels' conflicts. He virtually rewrote Tess of the d'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure to make them acceptable in England as serials (cf. Purdy, pp. 68-73, 88-90); and his treatment of the sentence quoted above reveals his sensitivity to possible objections from guardians of his nation's moral sense. A marginal note next to this sentence in Hardy's manuscript directs, "Omit for mag.", that is, for Macmillan's Magazine . Evidently, however, Macmillan's printers set the sentence in type, and Hardy left it in the first set of advance proofs sent to America and marked it for deletion in the second set. One notes with wry amusement that this sentence, thought too incendiary for English magazine readers, passed through the Harper's Bazar editorial offices without removal or alteration except in the spelling of "re-entered"). Apparently American serial readers were not thought to be as sensitive in general as English serial readers; in addition to the "daybreak" sentence above, two expressions of "My God!" remain (pp. 293, 350), demonstrating a more liberal editorial policy than existed in England, where "My God" was replaced in Macmillan's Magazine by "My heaven!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Besides more concretely establishing differences between the American book text and the English serial, presentation of a few of the revisions made for Macmillan's Magazine illustrates the sort of thing that Hardy as an artist gave attention to. Touches of humor concerning the servant Grammer's sale of rights to her corpse to Fitzpiers for physiological experiments are added to the English serial version by references to "the head in question" and "heathen's chopper" (pp. 142, 143). An erudite adjective, "accipitrine" (p. 254), is deleted for Macmillan's Magazine , as are "macaroni" and a technical architectural term, "double-cyma," in references to Fitzpiers (p. 120). Redundancies are taken out: in the American texts, Fitzpiers describes his youthful love for Felice as "a colossal passion in posse ; a giant in embryo;" in Macmillan's Magazine he terms it "a colossal passion in embryo" (p. 227). A word in Hardy's manuscript which Mowbray Morris, the editor of Macmillan's Magazine , had not liked, "horizontality," 5 was left in the proof sheets bound for America, but Macmillan's Magazine does not contain it. Also, in the Harper text as in the manuscript Mrs. Charmond had always been rich, while in Macmillan's Magazine she evidently married her husband for his money; the English version thereby makes more understandable the intensity of her interest in her frustrated youthful affection for Fitzpiers. This change in Mrs. Charmond's character occurs through two revisions: Fitzpiers' statement that "you have grown rich" had been in the American texts "You are still rich" (p. 227); and Felice says that her mother had prevented a lasting acquaintance with Fitzpiers, in the American texts because "she knew my disposition," in Macmillan's Magazine because "she knew my face was my only fortune" (p. 226). One interesting category of variants, certain manuscript passages that were published in America but not in Macmillan's Magazine , implies that the American text represents to a certain degree Hardy's intentions more fully than does the English serial. But the likely explanation for this fact is entirely non-aesthetic; the editors of Macmillan's Magazine were forced to excise several passages in order to fit Hardy's copy into available space in their magazine. Proof of this assertion is circumstantial: the eighth, ninth, and twelfth monthly portions in Macmillan's Magazine , from which the following material was deleted, end flush on the bottom of the last page given to the particular month's serial. A 250-word-long passage describing a meeting in church between Fitzpiers and Mrs. Charmond early in their affair is in the American text (p. 260), as are the following italicized passages describing Mrs. Charmond's haste and emotion in returning home after her trip to Melbury's on the night of Fitzpiers' accident: Once outside Melbury's gates, Mrs. Charmond ran with all her speed to the Manor House, without stopping or turning her head, and splitting her thin boots in her haste . She entered her own dwelling, as she had emerged from it, by the drawing-room window. In other circumstances she would have felt some timidity at undertaking such an unpremeditated ["unprecedented" in the manuscript] excursion alone; but her anxiety for another had cast out her fear for herself . Everything in her drawing-room was just as she had left it — the candles still burning, the casement closed, and ["and" is not in the manuscript] the shutters gently pulled to, so as to hide the state of the window from the cursory glance of a servant entering the apartment . She had been gone about three-quarters of an hour by the clock, . . (p. 317). Also contained in the manuscript and the American texts of The Woodlanders , though not in the English serial, are Grace's wish that either she or Marty had been Giles's wife "for a little while, and given the world a copy of him who was so valuable in their eyes" (p. 404), a long sentence commenting upon Fitzpiers' "marvellous escape from being dragged into the inquiry" following Mrs. Charmond's death (p. 404), and Tim Tangs's exclamation at finding the man-trap (p. 423). Of these deletions from the manuscript and American readings from Macmillan's Magazine , the last two were reinstated into the English text in the English first edition [text number 5 of the list at the beginning of this paper].</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV In addition to the passages already cited, which undergo only one alteration, a relatively sizable number of passages with multiple variants offer further evidence of what I have asserted about Hardy's creative methods; that is, they represent his perpetual desire to improve upon what he had once done. After one or more readings, during which he would make a number of changes, he sent each of the two sets of advance proofs to America. Then he would proofread again for the English serial, making new changes and rechanging passages already altered in the America-bound sheets. There are several of these "double-variants" which indicate Hardy's tentative, experimental approach to revision. For the purpose of more clearly distinguishing between the two American texts, I discuss in turn the passages that were first affected in the Harper's Bazar text and then those whose first alteration occurs in the Harper book text. The variants in Harper's Bazar which are mentioned below remain in the Harper book, as did those mentioned in Section I of this article; i.e., they receive their second revision in Macmillan's Magazine . In the manuscript, nature has "a curious perversity," in the Harper text "a serious apparent perversity," and in Macmillan's Magazine "an apparent perversity" (p. 136). In the manuscript, Fitzpiers "went to the door" to listen to Melbury's men talk about Mrs. Charmond's fretfulness, in the Harper text he "half opened the casement," and in Macmillan's Magazine he "half opened the window" (p. 298). An unconsciously half-humorous image in the manuscript, presenting Melbury "drawing the skin of his face together" before he whips away his arm from Fitzpiers' waist at hearing his son-in-law's drunken confessions of indifference to his wife, evolves into a slightly more realizable image in the Harper text, "the skin of his face compressed" (p. 307). Still, the omission of the description altogether for Macmillan's Magazine is probably to be preferred, since neither image can be readily pictured by the reader. The Harper book text also contains textual phenomena showing that Hardy "tested" revisions, altering or rejecting initial revisions. In the following discussion, it is understood that the manuscript reading is also in Harper's Bazar — that is, that the Harper book text alone contains the American variant. Again, the second revision is in Macmillan's Magazine . These revisions, while fairly numerous, are minor. They include both additions to the text and revisions of extant passages. For example, to the Harper book text is added a Shakespearean allusion, "like Horatio," which in Macmillan's Magazine is revised further to "like Hamlet's friend" (p. 264). An animistic description added in the second set of proof sheets about "funereal trees" singing dirges occurs in a different context in Macmillan's Magazine than it had in the Harper book text, and it also acquires a slightly different wording in the English serial. In the Harper book the passage is: "Deep darkness circled her about, the funereal trees rocked and chanted their diriges and placebos around her and she [Grace] did not know which way to go" (p. 293; italics mine). Feeling perhaps that "placebos" was too esoterically ironic, Hardy deleted the ingratiating quality of the sound of wind in the trees for Macmillan's Magazine , and corrected the spelling of "dirges:" "Mrs. Charmond's furs consoled Grace's cold face; and each one's body, as she breathed, alternately heaved against that of her companion; while the funereal trees rocked, and chanted dirges unceasingly" (p. 292). Plants crushed by the wheels of Melbury and Grace's gig are "strange" in the manuscript, "strange and ordinary" in the Harper book, and "strange and common" in Macmillan's Magazine (p. 164). In the manuscript Melbury tells Grace that if she marries Fitzpiers she will have "a blithe romantical life;" in the Harper book it is "a high intellectual life," and in Macmillan's Magazine "a high, perusing life" (p. 192). Mrs. Charmond's noble spirit is subject to "fierce assaults of introspection" in the manuscript, to "fierce periods of stress and storm" in the Harper book, and to "fierce periods of high-tide and storm" in Macmillan's Magazine (p. 281). Giles "said" in the manuscript, "said . . . within himself" in the Harper book, and "said . . . to himself" in Macmillan's Magazine (p. 350). In order to prevent her from realizing the sacrifice he is making by sleeping outside while giving her his hut, Giles hides from Grace his "pallor" in the manuscript, his "color" in the Harper book, and his "sickliness" in Macmillan's Magazine (p. 367).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V To discuss all of the Harper's Bazar and Harper book variants in detail would only bury the basic issues in an accumulation of individual words and short phrases. The striking thing is not that two authorized American versions have gone so long unnoted, but that Hardy would make the effort each month to read consecutively each of the two sets of advance proofs to be sent to his American publisher and nonetheless content himself with making only picayune revisions. The American texts reveal no trend in either revision. It would seem, then, that Hardy was not interested in shaping or was not able to shape his overall creative vision until the proofs of the entire novel were in his hands, which situation naturally was not possible at this time because the serialization of The Woodlanders began before Hardy had finished writing the novel. There is no reason to give credence to a natural suspicion, that someone in America may have written the significant variant passages in the two Harper texts. The variants in both Harper's Bazar and the Harper book are logical middle stages in the evolution of the affected passages from the manuscript to the Macmillan's Magazine text. This generalization holds true even though a few revisions do not fit into the scheme of progressive revision discussed in this article but follow an "alternate text" (1, 3; 2, 4) pattern. An example of an "alternate text" pattern is Melbury's reference to his second wife as Grace's "mother-law" in the manuscript (1) and the Harper book (3), but as Grace's "mother-in-law" in Harper's Bazar (2) and Macmillan's Magazine (4) (p. 185). Timothy, one of Melbury's workmen, uses the phrase "sole of his foot" in the manuscript and the Harper book, "sole of his boot" in Harper's Bazar and "sole of his boots" in Macmillan's Magazine (p. 255). An occasional variant in Harper's Bazar is a relative pronoun which clarifies an otherwise confusing sentence — a sentence that is published in the Harper book as Hardy originally wrote it. But these exceptions are minor, and were probably made either by Harper's Bazar proofreaders or by Hardy himself, who omitted to transfer the revisions to the second set of proofs, or — as in the case of "sole of his boot" — may have retained the manuscript reading in the second set of proofs and made a different revision in the proof sheets meant for Macmillan's Magazine . In the face of the preponderant evidence for progressive revision of the proof sheets destined for Harper's Bazar , the Harper book, and Macmillan's Magazine , these atypical variants are important only because they offer further evidence that the two American versions were set up from different copy. Certainly, the double variants referred to in Section IV of this paper demonstrate prima facie that a dissatisfied mind is striving consistently over a number of readings to achieve particular effects. Moreover, the longest addition, that describing Mrs. Charmond's artificial manner in receiving Melbury, is written in a style not unlike Hardy's frequent ponderosity in the setting of scene and description of motive. And so, even had Hardy given the Harper publishing house permission to alter passages of The Woodlanders as he had Atlantic magazine to alter those of Two on a Tower , 6 it is unlikely that any of the important passages discussed here were written by someone in America. The improbability is confirmed by the inclusion of several of these passages in Macmillan's Magazine months before the publication of the American first edition. To summarize the key findings of this investigation, then: In view of the number and types of differences among the four earliest versions of The Woodlanders , it is evident that Hardy sent in monthly installments one set of advance proof sheets to America for use by Harper's Bazar after he had made only a comparatively few revisions. These revisions were copied onto another set of proof sheets. This second set was sent to America after more revisions were made, and this set provided copy for the Harper book text. The absence of trends in the Harper book revisions indicates that this second set of proofs was also mailed in installments, probably within a few days after the installments of the first set; this indication is supported by noting that the main purpose of the second set was precautionary, against loss of the first set. In revising still a third set of proofs, to be returned to Macmillan's Magazine , Hardy altered or deleted some of the revisions made in the two sets of advance proofs sent to America in addition to making many completely new revisions. These findings add impetus to the contemporary scholarly view that Hardy was a conscientious craftsman, concerned that his product be as good as he could make it. 7 Obviously, the former view, that Hardy's awkward prose style can be attributed to his giving less than his best efforts because of his contempt for fiction when compared to poetry, is completely mistaken. Hardy was content with his work only after numerous rereadings and revisions that would have stultified the creativeness of a less dedicated writer. Indeed, Hardy was an inveterate reviser, given to making basically nit-picking revisions as well as — if not more than — to making significant changes. That he paid little attention to subsequent American printings of The Woodlanders does not negate this view, although he obviously held a less vigilant attitude toward his American texts once he had published them than toward his English texts, which he continued to revise intensively until 1912. 8</field>

Also, every reader familiar with Weber's work will recognize the authority for many details given here regarding transatlantic publication: see esp. his Hardy in America: A Study of Thomas Hardy and his American Readers (1946), pp. 11-132. 2 The only Harper book text available for direct comparison with the MS was a 1906 copy in the E. N. Sanders collection of Hardiana in the Dorset County Museum in Dorchester. I have checked the results of the collation of this 1906 text against a hardcover American first edition and a Franklin Square paperback (#572), both published by Harper and Brothers on March 25, 1887, and a 1905 printing by Harper and Brothers. All of these volumes have an identical text, having been printed from the same plates. Permission to quote from MS material has been given by the Dorset Archaeological and Natural History Society and by the Hardy estate trustees, Lloyd's Bank of London and Miss Irene Cooper Willis. Parenthetical page references to The Woodlanders , regardless of the version being discussed — the MS, Harper's Bazar , Harper book text, or Macmillan's Magazine — are to the pagination in the 1912 Wessex Edition and in the more readily available Macmillan Library Edition (London, 1963). 3 Weber, Hardy in America , pp. 26-27, 34-35, 38, 43. 4 Carl J. Weber, "The Manuscript of Hardy's Two on a Tower," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , XL (1946), 3, asserts that this was the reason for sending duplicate handwritten MSS of Two on a Tower . Weber also demonstrates that Hardy made revisions in the second MS of Two on a Tower that was sent to America; since this duplicate MS was not used by Atlantic printers, it contains readings that have never been printed (Weber, 6, 11-13), just as the Harper book text of The Woodlanders contains passages that appear in no other version [see below in text]. 5 According to a letter to Hardy by the publisher Frederick Macmillan, dated March 29, 1886 (Dorset County Museum MS). Macmillan reports that Morris thought the noun to be "an unusual &amp; perhaps not very pleasant looking word." 6 Carl J.

In the American texts of The Woodlanders , punctuation and capitalization differ frequently from usage in English versions, and the spelling conforms to American practice, e.g., "honor" and "wagon" for "honour" and "waggon." 7 See Robert C.

      <field name="heading_text">Harriet Weaver's Letters to James Joyce 191 5 -1 920 by John Firth *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harriet Shaw Weaver, to whom T. S. Eliot dedicated his Selected Essays "in recognition of her services to English letters," was the daughter of a country physician who brought her up in the Quaker tradition. It is Quaker modesty and aversion to extravagance which characterizes her in this collection of correspondence, for she allowed herself few autobiographical utterances and few flights of praise for the works she so much admired and whose author she befriended for twenty-four years. Still, where the letters of her colleagues are overt revelations of personality, where we are rapt by Wyndham Lewis' zeal, Ezra Pound's fireworks, or James Joyce's sharp wit, Miss Weaver's letters are solid witness to Eliot's dedication. They are a record of her "services." The hitherto unpublished collection of letters from the Cornell University Joyce Collection covers the time from April 22, 1915, to June 6, 1920, corresponding approximately to the period when Harriet Weaver began her connection with Joyce and extending up to the conclusion of the Egoist magazine's efforts to continue the serial publication of Ulysses . Miss Weaver became the editor of the Egoist in June, 1914, taking over from Dora Marsden who had begun the magazine in 1911 as a feminist review, the Freewoman . As the editor of the Egoist , it was Harriet Weaver's business to attend to the serial publication of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , which Miss Marsden had agreed to publish after being introduced to the novel by Ezra Pound. Miss Weaver was faced with many difficulties in carrying out the Egoist's commitment, the chief ones being the wartime breakdown of easy postal exchange between Joyce's various European locations and London, and the reluctance of English publishers and printers to handle outspoken novels in the wake of D. H. Lawrence's troubles with The Rainbow . The letters contain the details of her problems with publishers and printers, their last minute refusals and their willfullness in editing Joyce's text, as well as the details of desperate measures nearly adopted to see Joyce's work in covers, such as Ezra Pound's plan to paste little slips of paper containing excised passages from Portrait into blank spaces in a proposed first edition. The problems in acquiring accurate texts for the Egoist , in providing American publishers with revised texts, and in getting them back herself, are also related in the letters. Miss Weaver writes of a variety of texts of Portrait , of the famous Dublin Holograph, of some made up from corrected copies of the Egoist , of a text sent to the American publisher John Marshall made up in part from the supposedly destroyed original typescript, and of corrections in the supposedly unrevised second English edition. The letters also contain a wealth of information about the sales of Portrait and about decisions concerning the price of the book. But the story of the struggle to publish Portrait is best told by the letters themselves, as is the story of the growing friendship between Harriet Weaver and James Joyce which led to her patronage of the author and continued on to the executorship of his literary estate. The transcribing of these letters has been quite painless, for they are in good condition and Miss Weaver's handwriting presents few problems. She was not fond of abbreviations or private shorthand devices, and the few mannerisms of her hand are easily decipherable. No attempt has been made to edit Miss Weaver's occasional irregularities in punctuation or her infrequent misspellings. In addition to any self-justification for my handling this correspondence, I have three motives for including footnotes with the collection: (1) to explain the context of many of Miss Weaver's statements which are often direct replies to questions or remarks made by Joyce in previous letters, (2) to refer the reader to related letters, and (3) to supply biographical and circumstantial information about some of the many names, places, and events mentioned in these letters. For economy's sake, I have not copied letterheads. They are as follows, my brackets indicating Miss Weaver's own handwriting. The letters, Cornell Joyce Collection numbers 1298 and 1299, are on business stationery headed "The Egoist, / Oakley House Bloomsbury Street, / London, W. C." On business stationery headed "The Egoist / (Published by the proprietors, The New Freewoman, Ltd.) / Oakley House, Bloomsbury Street, London, W.C.," Miss Weaver wrote the letters, Cornell numbers 1300-1303, 1307, 1316, 1317, 1319, 1328, 1330, 1335, and 1336. Letters, Cornell numbers 1304-1306, 1308-1315, 1318, 1320, 1321, 1323-27, 1329, 1331-34, 1337-43, 1345-50, 1352-55, and 1357, are on Harriet Weaver's personal stationery headed "74 Gloucester Place, / [London,] W." Cornell numbers 1322 and 1358 are headed "The Vicarage, / Brighouse. / [Yorkshire]." Number 1351 is headed "[Arnewood / The Avenue / Totland Bay / Isle of Wight]." Letter number 1356 is a card headed [74 Gloucester Place, London, W. 1]; number 1359, also a card, is headed "[c/o Miss Wright / Frodsham / Warrington / England]." I have omitted Miss Weaver's signatures as well as the letterheads. She signed all the correspondence "Harriet Weaver" except for the first two letters, numbers 1298, 1299, which she signed "Harriet Shaw Weaver," and the telegram which, of course, has no signature. The postscripts in letters, numbers 1298 and 1304, are initialed "H. S. W."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1298 April 22nd 1915 Dear Mr. Joyce, Mr. Pound sent Mr. Grant Richards, 1 about a month ago I think, the part of the M.S. of your novel which has not yet been set up, together with a complete set of the numbers of "The Egoist" in which it has appeared up to date. I asked for the M.S. to be returned by May 20th. This would give Mr. Richards two months in which to consider it. If he should want it again it shall be returned to him after a further portion has been set up. | Yours sincerely Would you care for any copies of "The Egoist" 2 to be sent to you to the address in Venice? 3 I could have one copy of all the back numbers from August sent if you like, &amp; the current number each month from now — apart from the three you asked to have reserved for you. 4</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1299 July 7th 1915 Dear Mr. Joyce, Mr. Grant Richards returned, six or seven weeks ago, the portion of your MSS. that had not been set up in type, since when I have heard nothing further from him or Mr. Pound. The novel will run on for another four numbers in "The Egoist" (i.e. till Nov. 1st) unless you would particularly like it to be finished sooner on account of publication in book form. 1 I am sending you copies of the last two numbers so that you may see how it is going on &amp; what "The Egoist" is like now. I am glad to hear you have reached Switzerland safely. | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1300 July 28th 1915 Dear Mr. Joyce, It was because of Messrs. Partridge &amp; Coopers' stupid censoring of your novel that we left them — that is, they had objected once of or [ folls. del. of] twice to things in other parts of the paper, but their behaviour over your novel was the crowning offense. They struck out a passage on Aug. 1st of last year. 1 I could not help it. The rest was set up correctly until they came to the latter part of chapter four where as you have seen some sentences were omitted. I then submitted the whole of chapter five to them. They declined to set it up as it stood &amp; so we left them. 2 I am sorry to say that Messrs. Ballantyne are now acting in the same way. They refuse to print certain passages in the August instatment [sic]. I can but apologise to you. 3 Mr. Pinker 4 has proofs containing all the deleted matter. I hope you will not have this annoyance when the novel comes to be printed in book form. I am sending you the numbers you ask for. | With kind regards &amp; apologies | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1301 Sep. 6th 1915 Dear Mr. Joyce, I thank you very much for your kind letter &amp; good wishes. But it is rather we who owe you very warm thanks for having given us your novel &amp; for having allowed it to make its first appearance in the Egoist, and it was the least I could do in return, &amp; a pleasure to me, to try &amp; protect the text. The September number is late &amp; does not go out till tomorrow, for Miss Marsden has again been unwell &amp; was unable to finish her leader [?] up to time. 1 If it would at all interest you to continue to see the Egoist I would gladly arrange to have a copy sent to you each month &amp; in a printed wrapper. With very grateful thanks from all our staff &amp; kind regards | I am | Yours very sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1302 Sep. 24th 1915 Dear Mr. Joyce I am much obliged to you for your kind promise of a copy of your book (which of course I shall be very glad to accept) "when and if" it is published. From this "if" I take it you must be having difficulites with publishers again &amp; I am very sorry to hear it. 1 I hope indeed they will not all prove so stupid as to decline to bring out your novel. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1303 Nov. 30th 1915 Dear Mr. Joyce, Yes, it was Mme. Ciolkowska 1 who suggested our trying to communicate with you when you were in Austria through her sister in Switzerland, &amp; I feel sure she would gladly do what she could towards interesting any Paris publishers she knew on your behalf. Her present address is : — 9 Rue de l'Eperon, Paris 6 — But I am afraid it is a bad time to hope to get a book published in Paris. Most publishers there seem either to be closed or to be undertaking very little ordinary work just now — very little besides war books I mean. I have been wondering whether The Egoist could do it. Of course this would be nothing like so satisfactory as if the book were brought out by a proper book-publisher in London with his regular machinery for advertisement etc, but it might perhaps be just better than having it published in Paris. If you like I will speak to Mr. Pinker &amp; see what he thinks about it. 2 If he thought the scheme at all practicable I would then consult the other members of our staff &amp; the directors of our small publishing company (The New Freewoman Ltd.) whose consent would have to be obtained. We are bringing out a small pamphlet of poems by a French poet who has not been able to get them printed in Paris at this time. 3 The December Egoist is late again. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1304 January 14th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce I have seen Mr. Pinker again &amp; he still has hopes of getting some firm or other to bring out your novel. If he fails, we will do it. I have the necessary permissions. Meantime, as our journal, is after [ folls. del. is] stringent economics, is now in a better financial position than it was when your novel was running through it, we think it only fair to make you some payment for the past serial rights, &amp; we could now pay you £ 50. For safety, lest the letter should by any chance go wrong, I am writing from my flat &amp; avoiding our official paper, so that the name of the sender may not appear. The order is made out in the name of the journal, not the company. And for safety also I am sending half the amount now, &amp; when I hear that this has reached you I will send the other half. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely I had thought the Post Office here would have given me an order to enclose in this letter, but instead they have given me a receipt to keep, &amp; they say that the Zürich Post Office will deliver you the money.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1305 January 28th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce Many thanks for your telegram which arrived at about midday on Saturday &amp; for your letter 1 which reached me yesterday. The second instalment is being dispatched today in the same way. Please do not trouble to telegraph this time. As the first instalment reached you safely I will take it that the second will do so also. And please do not talk of kindness — it was a debt owing to you. I was rather worried by a letter from Mr. Pound in which he said you were in need of money. I felt wretched &amp; ashamed to think we had had your wonderful book &amp; made you no return whatever. The kindness is entirely yours in never having drawn attention to the fact. It is a fortnight since I saw your agent &amp; I have had no word from him since. He promised to write as soon as he had anything definite to say. The December &amp; January numbers of our paper which were posted to you under our printed wrapper have lately been returned to us from the Censor's Office. I find there is a new regulation making it necessary to obtain direct permission from the War Office before any periodicals can be sent from this country to neutral European countries, &amp; we have not as yet obtained this permission. Apparently there are many formalities to be gone through. May I send good wishes for your birthday? | And with kind regards | I am | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1306 March 3rd 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce I am sorry to say our difficulties with printers are not over as I had thought. We began to go into details with Messrs. Richard Clay &amp; Sons as to paper, type &amp; so on, &amp; then after a fortnight's delay they announced that they could not print the book without deletions. A third firm refused for the same reasons, &amp; a fourth has been considering the matter all this week &amp; I am not altogether hopeful of a favourable reply. Meanwhile time is getting on. A clerk at Oakley House whose services we are able to make use of in this matter of publishing &amp; who, curiously enough, was previously in the employment of Messrs. Maunsel &amp; Co. &amp; remembers well the disputes over your book Dubliners , tells me that any book that is coming out in the spring should be out by April 1st. I am afraid we can hardly hope for this now, for no doubt you will want to see proofs (when at last we succeed in securing a printer) shall you not? 1 Perhaps you would also let me know whether you have any preference as to colour of binding. Shall it be like Dubliners or would you prefer a different colour? 2 Mr. Pound suggests that I try &amp; induce some American firm (he has given me three likely names) to take from us a number of unbound copies &amp; be responsible for publication in America, &amp; I will do this as soon as we have found a printer. I have not seen the agreement that Mr. Pinker was to draw up. 3 This matter is also in abeyance until such time as a printer is forthcoming. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1307 March 25th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce, This morning there has come a refusal from a seventh printer &amp; I am becoming fairly hopeless. I am writing today to a firm 1 in Edinburgh who printed the Temple edition of Shakespeare. If they refuse I have very little hope of finding any firm willing to print without deletions. Possibly they are all frightened by the recent prosecution of Mr. D. H. Lawrence's book "The Rainbow." Mr. Pound wrote a week or so ago that he had written to you making the suggestion that if all printers refuse, the book should be printed with blank spaces where passages had been cut &amp; the excisions afterwards manifolded by typewriter on good paper &amp; pasted in. 2 Probably I shall hear from him as to whether or not you agree to this suggestion. 3 Both Mr. Pound &amp; Mr. Pinker tell me they do not consider publishers' seasons of any importance with a book of this kind. 4 But if there is much more delay I am afraid the clerk (working for another journal here) whose services we should borrow &amp; who is the only person here who knows anything about book publishing, may have gone, as he is expecting to be called up for military service any day now. Mr. Pinker has sent a draft agreement but if you do not mind I would rather not sign it just yet, for he has put in a clause by which "The Egoist" undertakes to print &amp; publish your novel this year. I hope it may be done but owing to all these difficulties there is of course some doubt. I should have no hesitation in signing it if we had only you to deal with, but it is a different matter to be in Mr. Pinker's hands &amp; he appoints himself your representative on all questions concerning the carrying out of the agreement. There does not appear to me to be any urgency as regards the signing of the thing, &amp; as you were good enough to say you would agree to any terms (subject to a 10 percent discount to Mr. Pinker) I think you will probably raise no objection to the delay. I had thought you might prefer to see proofs but as this is not the case we will not waste time by sending them &amp; if Mr. Pound does not read them I will. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1308 April 15th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce Thank you for your letter of March 31st. The Edinburgh printer and another declined the book (making nine refusals). It is now with two others of whom I have better hopes. There should be replies from them next week. I will tell you at once if either is favourable. Two American publishers also have the complete text and have been asked to cable if they are willing to undertake publication &amp; printing. Mr. Pound wrote strong letters to both. 1 I hope, therefore, it will not be necessary to fall back on Mr. Pound's plan of printing with blank spaces for typewritten insertions — to which you say you agree. I am sending you the March &amp; April numbers of "The Egoist." It was Miss Marsden's suggestion to talk of your book in the March number and she wrote that last section nearly as it stands. In fact the article should have been signed by her for, though it was my foundation, she worked it up. 2 | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1309 May 19th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce The two printers who had seemed more reasonable, after considerable delay finally decided declined [ folls. del. decided], like the others, to print without deletions; as also did a twelth [sic]. And since then our own printers have said they would object even to printing with blank spaces. But you will have heard from Mr. Pound than [sic] an American publisher, a Mr. John Marshall of New York, is willing to undertake not only the American publication but also will print the book entire. He said he had written also to me but no letter from him has reached me as yet. I am writing to him today as to his sending us copies for publication here. I am afraid it will be a few months before the book is actually out, at least in England, but it will be a relief to you that the matter is at last settled — for I think we may take it that it is. Possibly you may have received a letter from a Mr. Bryceson Treharne 1 (whose handwriting is almost illegible). He wrote a short time ago to ask if I could put him in touch with four people (of whom you were one) some of whose poems he had set to music. So I sent him the addresses. I know very little about him. He is mentioned by Mr. Leigh Henry in the extracts from his letters to his wife published in the December "Egoist." 2 He was sent home from Ruhleben in December owing to ill health, and called at Oakley House a little time ago, and it is since then that he wrote for the addresses. Apparently he is a professional composer. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1310 May 31st 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce Your letter reached me last night and I thank you for it. I have still the typescript of chapter V and I am sending this off today to Mr. Marshall asking him to let his printers set up from this exactly as it stands, without adding commas or capitals. As I was stupid enough to destroy the rest of the typescript it would be a help if you would kindly do what you suggest and weed out errors in chapters III &amp; IV. If you will then send them to me (here, please, as I am not at Oakley House every day) I will insert the passages deleted by our printers and forward them on to Mr. Marshall on the chance that it is not too late for his printers to set up from them. I will despatch to you today cuttings 1 containing chapters I &amp; II and perhaps you will correct these also and let me have them back. I shall ask Mr. Marshall either to send me proofs or have them corrected according to the corrected text. The arrangement is that as he is willing to print without deletions he shall print and publish in America and send us copies in sheets to be bound &amp; published in London — at least I hope this arrangement will be carried through but I have not yet had a letter from him. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1311 June 12th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce Many thanks for sending so quickly the corrections for the third and fourth chapters of your novel and for making them out so clearly. I am sorry that the cuttings of chapters I &amp; II had not reached you when you wrote. They had to be handed in at the censor's office with an explanation as to what they were and left for him to look through. It therefore did not seem possible to send them by express post but perhaps it could have been done. Yes, it was your unabridged text that Mr. Marshall agreed to publish. He has it all but I thought it safer to add the deleted passages also to the text containing your corrections lest they should be forgotten. I have also sent him the slip you enclosed. We have suggested to him that the names of both publishers should appear in both the American and English editions. Do you agree to this? I enquired and found that, unfortunately, it will be necessary for the name of our publishing company (the New Freewoman Ltd.) to appear on the title page because "The Egoist" is not a legal entity, but the name of the company will be printed in small type as publishing for "The Egoist" London (larger type). | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1312 June 14th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce Many thanks for returning the cuttings with your corrections. I sent them on at once to Mr. Marshall. It is almost a month since I first wrote to him but I have had no letter from him as yet. The American posts to this country have been very irregular for some time past. I will write to you as soon a I hear from him. The May and June numbers of "The Egoist" were dispatched to you last week and with them, from Mr. Pound, a copy of the American review "Drama" containing an article by him on your play. 1 | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1313 June 28th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce I am still without a letter from Mr. Marshall but I had a letter today from another New York publisher, Mr. Huebsch. 1 I showed it to Mr. Pinker this afternoon and he said he would write to you on the matter at once. Mr. Huebsch has read the complete text of your novel (which was sent on to him by Mr. Byrne Hackett 2 of the Yale University Press) and he writes that he would very much like to publish it and would have it printed without any deletions. I have written today to tell him that you have already accepted the offer of another New York publisher, but that should these negotiations fall through for any reason he should at once be informed and Mr. Pinker would go into the matter with him. Though his offer is not so good as Mr. Marshall's I imagine his firm has a better standing. He said he had already been in correspondence with you &amp; Mr. Pinker. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1314 August 19th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce Mr. Pound writes that his negotiations with Mr. Heinemann 1 for the publication of your novel have fallen through and he asks me to go on with the arrangements for its publication by "The Egoist" through Mr. Huebsch. I am cabling to Mr. Huebsch ordering copies for "The Egoist" and am writing to him in greater detail. 2 I wrote some weeks ago to ask Mr. John Marshall to hand on to him the text containing your corrections, and to Mr. Huebsch to expect it and to instruct his printers to make no alterations in it. I hope that nothing will go wrong now and that the book will really appear in print at last. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1315 September 7th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce I received yesterday a letter from Mr. Huebsch (dated August 25th) 1 in which he said that he was waiting to hear from your agent before having the book set up: he was proposing some amendments in the contract that had been sent to him by your agent and if the latter accepted these and cabled to that effect he would have the printing put in hand at once. He asked if I would see Mr. Pinker and urge him to give the matter immediate attention. I cabled therefore and learnt that he had cabled at once on receiving Mr. Huebsch's letter yesterday morning, accepting the amendments. 2 Unfortunately, Mr. Huebsch had not, when he wrote on August 25th, received from Mr. Marshall the corrected copy of the novel. He had just been told that Mr. Marshall had gone to Quebec and he was writing to him that day. As it seemed to me doubtful whether he would succeed in getting hold of the thing I decided to send out the corrections afresh and I posted to him last night cuttings containing the corrections you sent for chapters III &amp; IV. Today I have made corrections in the other chapters and have dispatched these also to him. I think I have made most of the corrections you would wish to have but in case you should like to make them again yourself I am sending to you today by express post cuttings of chapters I, II, and also V. Mr. Huebsch is anxious to hurry the affair on in order to include the book in his autumn list but your corrections of these chapters would no doubt reach him in time for the reader to use them when correcting the proofs. Many thanks for your letter. It pleased me greatly that you should have remembered my birthday: please accept my best thanks for your very kind wishes. | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1316 September 7th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce I enclose cuttings of chapters I, II &amp; V of your novel. It might save a little time if you were to send them, when corrected, direct to the publisher — | Mr. B. W. Huebsch | 225 Fifth Avenue | New York I cannot fill in the deleted sentences because Mr. Heinemann has not yet returned the copy I sent him to read, but I have asked Mr. Huebsch to be sure to see that they are all inserted: he has them all in his uncorrected copy. I have written to you by this post explaining why the corrections have to be made again. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1317 October 2nd 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce I wrote to you a week ago to tell you of the safe arrival of your corrections of the three chapters of your novel but the letter has just been returned to me. I sent on the corrections at once to the American publisher. He has not mentioned to me any particular date on which he hopes to publish the book nor has he said how soon he will be able to send sheets over here. As soon as there is any more definite news from him I will write to you. I quite agree with you that it might be useful to insert in the copies that go out for review slips containing some extracts from the press notices of your book Dubliners . 1 Your agent has now sent me these and I will make a selection unless you would prefer to do it yourself. The ten copies that you wish to buy could be sent out when the review copies go or a few days earlier if you would prefer it. Perhaps you will let me know later on whether they should be sent to Mr. Pound: otherwise they could easily be sent out from here if you would let me have the addresses later: in this case I suppose you would send notes or slips to be enclosed. I hope you are able to make some progress with your new book. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1318 October 19th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce I thank you for your letter of the 18th. I had a letter yesterday from the New York publisher acknowledging the receipt of your corrections of chapters I, II &amp; V of your novel. He writes that he will do his very best to get the book out before the end of the year but is not quite certain of being able to manage it. This being the case I am afraid it can hardly be ready for publication here before the early part of next year. I had a letter also from Mr. Byrne Hackett to whom Mr. Pound wrote originally and who brought your book to the notice of Mr. Huebsch. He writes that he considers Mr. Heubsch the best of the younger American publishers and by best he means the most imaginative honourable and resourceful. I gather that Mr. Hackett keeps a bookshop in connexion with the Yale University Press. He says that in his capacity of bookseller he will do all in his power for the success of the book and he also feels sure that his brother, 1 who is literary editor of the New York New Republic , will review the book "at length and with discrimination." This should be a help for I think the journal has a large circulation. Mr. Hackett asks to be remembered to you though he thinks it quite likely that you will have no recollection of him. He says he was at Clongowes when you were but was an altogether obscure member of "first junior" at that time. He was unhappy at the school. 2 | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1319 October 24th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce I find this letter 1 here today from Mr. Huebsch: I am writing to tell him that I am referring it to you. Shall I send a copy of "Chamber Music"? Your agent has already sent him a copy of the extracts from the press notices of your book "Dubliners". | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1320 [25 October 1916] Dear Mr. Joyce I am afraid I am not an imaginative enterprising and resourceful publisher but merely imitative. The request of the American publisher has suggested to me that it would be useful to print in The Egoist before the publication of your novel an article on you which perhaps Mr. Pound would be good enough to write. 1 If you agree to this I will ask him. Would you be willing for it to be accompanied by a woodcut of yourself which I would get the young Norwegian, Mr. Kristoin, 2 to do if you could supply a photograph? Perhaps Mr. Pound has one? I send this by express post in order that you may have the two suggestions together. Please reply to me to | c/o Miss Wright | Frodsham | near Warrington | where I go on Thursday next week. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1321 November 10th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce Your letter 1 was forwarded and reached me yesterday. I am concerned to hear of your illness and that you are suffering from a nervous breakdown. When you write again will you please tell me how you are. I shall hope to hear that you are feeling better and that you have had no more collapses. I had a letter (dated October 17th) from the American publisher saying that your book was then in the hands of the printers and that he quite hoped to be able to bring it out this season, by which I take him to mean before the end of the year. I have written to tell him that you wish it to bear the date 1916 in any case. On October 24th I had a letter from him which I forwarded to you by express post that day and I wrote to you also by express post the following day: I am surprised that the letters had not reached you when you wrote on October 30th. If Mr. Huebsch's letter does not reach you I must repeat to you what he said. Perhaps I had better do so now to save delay. He said he would like to have autobiographical details about you for use in the press both before and after the publication of your novel and that he would be glad to have a photograph of you for the same purpose. I wrote to him that I was referring the letter to you. Now that you are ill I expect you will not want to be troubled with giving him the information for which he asks. He also asked to see a copy of your book Chamber Music with a view to an American edition and, since I was coming away before I could hear from you, I arranged for one to be sent to him and I sent him a message from Mr. Elkin Matthews 2 as to the terms on which he would be willing to dispose of the American copyright. I also told him that he ought to communicate also with your agent if he decides he would like to publish the book. I shall be back in London before I can hear from you after you receive this par [?]. If you write please send a postcard only. if you are still unwell. | With many kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1322 November 18th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce Thanks for your letter with the enclosures for Mr. Huebsch and also for the two sets of photographs. 1 I forwarded the enclosures and one set of photographs and gave him your message. I am sorry that the copy of "The Egoist" of January 15.1914 cannot be sent until the December number goes out for we have now to send the American copies also through an agent having a special permit and he wishes to be troubled as few times as possible. There are a good many more readers (both English &amp; American) since your novel finished in "The Egoist": that is why I thought an article by Mr. Pound would be useful. I had a letter 2 from him yesterday suggesting that, for variety's sake, I should ask Mr. Edward Marsh to write it but I hope that he (Mr. Marsh) and some other writers (including Mr. H. G. Wells and Mr. George Moore) may be willing to write reviews in other papers when the book appears. I shall try and see Mr. Pound about this after I return to London next week. I read your slips for Mr. Huebsch and I thank you for mentioning "The Egoist" and for your kind reference to me. 3 I am glad to hear from Mr. Pound that you were rather better and had had no more collapses. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1323 November 30th 1916 Dear Mr. Joyce The two larger photographs have reached me safely. I sent the first of them straight on to New York without letting Mr. Kristian see it because he is a very dilatory person and would have been very slow in returning it. Also it had not occurred to me that they would not both be alike. He will have plenty of time as the article will not go in before January (or possibly February if it should turn out to be impossible for the book to be ready for publication here in January). I have written to ask Mr. Huebsch if he will cable as soon as ever the book is actually out in New York and I will telegraph to you immediately I get the news. I will also let you know as soon as the sheets 1 arrive here. Mr. Pound thinks that Mr. H. G. Wells and Mr. William Archer may very likely be willing to write special reviews (the former perhaps in The Nation ) if I ask them nearer the time of the publication of the book. And he will write later to Mr. Clutton Brock 2 who has charge of The Times reviewing staff. There are also two or three others whom we hope to get hold of. But Mr. Wells will be the most useful, I think, if he can be prevailed upon to do it. I am very glad to hear that you are improving and hope the cure you are making will be successful. | With very kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1324 January 2nd 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce Many thanks for your kind letter. A cable from Mr. Huebsch arrived yesterday and I hope you will have received yesterday or today my telegram of yesterday telling you that your book has appeared in New York. Today I received a letter from Mr. Huebsch, written on December 20th, saying that he had just shipped sheets to England. I suppose they will be a few weeks on their journey and I am afraid it will be nearly a month after their arrival before they can be bound and ready for publication here. The slips in the December Egoist were sent to the American subscribers only. Mr. Huebsch has received all three photographs and thanks you for them. I hope that this year 1917 will bring success to your book both in America and the United Kingdom. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1325 January 26th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce I telegraphed to you on the 22nd to tell you that the sheets from America had arrived that day. I am glad to say that the binders will be rather quicker over their work than I had expected and have promised to deliver some of the books in a fortnight's time. For safety, however, we are announcing the 15th as the date of publication. The twelve presentation copies that you wish sent out shall go out the first of all, before the review copies. I will send you the three copies for which you ask: I am very much obliged to you for the one you are going to be so kind as to give me and to write in. If you will accept it from me I would like to give you your own copy, apart from the ten that are yours by arrangement. This will leave four for your account. The nominal published price is 6/— but the book will be obtainable at shops for 5/—. The trade price for single or for a few copies will be 4/3; for a dozen or more 3/9. When the book is out I will inquire the postage rate per dozen to Switzerland. I am glad to hear you hope to be able to dispose of a few dozen in Zurich. I have written to ask Mr. Huebsch to send me copies of the American press notices unless he has already arranged to send them to your agent. Please accept my best wishes for your birthday and many kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1326 February 7th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce Many thanks for your telegram and card. The books came from the binders yesterday afternoon and your twelve presentation copies were sent off at once. The review copies for London papers will be delivered by hand tomorrow morning: those for post went off this afternoon. I will send you the three copies soon but I find they will have to go through an agent having a permit. The book rate to Switzerland is fourpence per pound; not more than four pounds can be sent in one package and there is no reduction in the rate for weights above a pound. As each book, with wrappings, weighs just a pound this works out at fourpence a copy for whatever numbers are sent. It would not be fair for you to pay the whole of this &amp; if you buy a few dozen copies, we should halve it at any rate. I am told now that the trade price for a dozen copies should be 3/6 per copy and for smaller numbers 4/— per copy and that to every dozen copies one must be added free. Mr. Pound has secured two or three promises of reviews and I have one or two. Mr. H. G. Wells declines to write a review himself — he has not the time he says — but promises to speak about the book to the editor of the Nation (formerly the Speaker ). I expect you would like to see all the notices in full would you not? | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1327 February 26th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce Mr. Huebsch sent me the enclosed, asking me to forward it to you. I wonder whether you have received two letters from me — one of them written towards the end of January and sent to your last address; the other written nearly three weeks ago and sent by express post to your new address. 1 I wrote the latter, I remember, on the 7th, the day the first review copies of your book were posted. Your twelve presentation copies had been sent out the day before. One of these, by the way, has since been returned, marked "gone away". It was the one sent to Mr. Healy at the address you gave (6 Saint Lawrence Road, Clontarf, Dublin). 2 The book has been on sale now for a fortnight and tradespeople have begun to send for copies though I think no reviews have appeared as yet in London papers — nothing beyond the bare announcement of publication. You asked me to tell you the prices of the book and I did so but will repeat in case you have not had the letters. Though the nominal published price is 6/— the real net price is 5/—. The trade price is 4/— and for orders of a dozen copies, 3/6 per copy with one extra copy added free (thirteen for the price of twelve). The postal rates to Switzerland come to fourpence a copy and there is no reduction in the rate whatever numbers are sent. If you buy a few dozen I do not think you should pay the postage: it ought to be a publication expense. You asked me also whether Mr. Huebsch had arranged to send me copies of the American press notices. I wrote to ask him to do so unless he had already arranged to send them to your agent. In my earlier letter I said I would send you the three copies for which you asked and I thanked you for your kindness in saying that one of them was for me and that you wanted to write a few words in this one as well as in the one for Mr. Pound. I asked whether you would accept your own copy from me, apart from the ten that you receive by agreement. Though I have not heard from you I shall venture to send it now without waiting any longer. I have wondered whether you were ill again or whether I had annoyed you or whether perhaps the letters did not reach you. 3 In the one I wrote more than a month ago I sent my best wishes for your birthday and am sorry if the message did not reach you on the day. It was very good of you to telegraph twice in acknowledgement of my telegrams. | With many thanks and kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1328 February 28th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce Mr. Wells has been better than his word and after all has himself written an appreciative review of your book in The Nation . 11 I enclose a cutting. I have written to thank him. A few short notices have come in. When a number more have come I will have them copied and will send them to you. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1329 March 2nd 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce You will see from the enclosed cutting that The Times Literary Supplement has given a special review in the body of the paper, not in the ordinary novel review column. 1 This should be a great help to the sales. Mr. Pound had written to Mr. Clutton Brock, who writes their leading articles, and got him to ask the editor to let him have the book to review. I enclose copies of five short reviews that have come in. I will send others when they come. I received yesterday M. Battara's letter, dated February 17th. I am very sorry to hear that you have been ill again and hope you are rather better by this time and that you will get well soon. I sent thirteen copies of your book yesterday to an agent with directions for them to be forwarded to you as soon as possible. I had sent them three copies on Monday. I hope they will all reach you safely. Please do not be in any hurry about sending the money for them. | With many kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1330 March 8th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce I enclose three more press notices of your book, a letter from Mr. Clutton Brock which Mr. Pound thought you might like to see and a post card addressed to you. The sales are making a good start I think. Ninety seven copies of the book were ordered last week (including your dozen) and already this week nearly two hundred have been ordered — the greater number of them by a wholesale firm which distributes books all over the country. Two Dublin shops have sent for copies. I hope you are a good deal better now and that you are not having more of the unpleasant attacks that you had in the autumn. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1331 March 16th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce Many thanks for your letter and for the book and for the money order for £2.6.4 for which I enclose receipt. I enclose a few more press notices, all that have come in up to date. "The Future" is a new journal which I have only just seen. No press cutting was sent to me. I think they will review your book in their April number: I have given them a copy today. 1 The sales have dropped off this week. If they do not pick up again soon we shall advertise in one or two of the most likely papers. We are at a disadvantage of course, in having no agents or travellers, in fact no business staff at all. So far, the none [ folls. del. the] of the libraries 2 have taken the book except "The Times" Book Club. which has had a dozen copies. I am very sorry to hear that you have had such a dangerous illness of the eyes. I hope they are quite out of danger now and that the attacks will not return. I suppose that ever since you were taken ill in the autumn you have been able to work very little at the book you are writing. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely Please note the addition of the number 1 to my address.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1332 March 24th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce Thanks for your letter of the 13th. A second dozen books were dispatched to you early in the week and I hope will reach you safely. I received the enclosed letter from Mr. Huebsch at the beginning of this week but the original letter he speaks of, with the enclosures, has not yet come. Perhaps it will come by next week's mail; if it does I will send on the reviews to you. If it does not arrive at all I will ask Mr. Huebsch to send fresh copies. I have received no press notices this week. Most of the papers are devoting very little space to book reviews now and I fancy that many of them judge a book by the publisher rather than by its contents and scarcely trouble to look at a book that is not published by a well known firm. It will have to make its way gradually now I expect. I hope that you are better this week and your eyes are out of danger. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1333 April 4th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce I enclose the press notices spoken of by Mr. Huebsch in the letter that I sent to you. I kept them a few days to have them copied. The Springfield Union review, though shorter than some, seems to me to be the best on the whole that has appeared so far. The sales have improved a little but not very much and I am afraid that the words on the back page of the April Egoist saying that the first edition is nearly exhausted are an exaggeration. Miss Marsden suggested the back page advertisement and wrote the short introduction. 1 I am sending copies to a number of lapsed subscribers. I am glad to hear that you are better. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1334 April 16th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce I enclose five notices of your book. Mr. Huebsch has sent me no more notices but I have looked up the New Republic in a library and I see that the review by Mr. Wells is the one that appeared in the Nation . It is classed under "articles of general interest." There was also a long review in that paper on March 3rd by Mr. Francis Hackett. 1 I am sending for a copy. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1335 April 20th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce Your card of the 9th reached me two days ago and I am making enquiries why the eight American reviews were stopped and what has become of them. If I do not succeed in obtaining the originals I will send you typewritten copies. It is fortunate that I had them made. Mr. Pound tells me he is sending you the review by Mr. Francis Hackett in the New Republic and one by Mr. John Quinn 1 in Vanity Fair . I sent you 4 or 5 English press notices early in the week and enclose now 3 from Irish papers. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1336 April 25th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce I enclose a letter which I am asked to forward to you and a review of your novel by the New Witness . A reviewer at last speaks of the beauty of the book. In a few days time I will send you copies of the American reviews that did not reach you. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1337 April 29th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce The eight American reviews of your novel that were removed from my letter of April 4th cannot be traced at the censor's office and appear to have been destroyed. It seems that it is not permissible to send American press cuttings from this country to a neutral country: the censor has, however, been kind enough to say that he will allow the enclosed type-written copies of the missing eight American reviews to go through to you. I have written to ask Mr. Huebsch to send the American reviews direct to you in future. He has sent me none but these eight. The censor was surprised to hear that the English press notices sent by me had reached you and said that it is not really permissible to send English newspaper cuttings except through a press cutting agency. I have therefore arranged with Messrs Durrant's press cutting agency that they will send you duplicate cuttings of any further notices that appear. From time to time I will send you a list of what ought to reach you: please let me know if any of them do not arrive. I think I have sent you already a total of twenty four notices including one from an American paper. I suppose there will not be very many more. I hope your eyes are quite cured now. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1338 May 12th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce Many thanks for your letter 1 of April 22nd and for the money order for £2.6.4 for the second dozen copies of your novel. I enclose a receipt. I enclose also a copy of a notice that has appeared in the English Review 2 — I do not think the press cutting agency sends cuttings from that paper. The English Review wrote and asked for a copy of the book (I had not sent them one as they do very little reviewing). Mr. Ernest Boyd 3 wrote and asked for a copy, so did the Sphere , so also about half a dozen other papers, including an English Church illustrated paper! I think this last paper cannot have ventured to print a review. 4 The only notice I have received from the press cutting agency since I asked them to send duplicates to you is one of two lines from the Daily Chronicle . The sales continue to be rather slow. 41 copies were sold in April and 11 in the first 11 days of this month. The total number sold up to date is 435 (336 of these have been paid for, 99 not yet paid for). I am hoping to have soon the help of someone who has been with a large publisher and who would know how to make use of the reviews and how to push the book. There are about 240 copies left and, in the hope of another edition being wanted, I have written to Mr. Huebsch about this. I have sent him a few corrections to be made before another edition (English or American) is printed. The printers seem not to have understood that in most places where you crossed out hyphens you meant the words to be joined together and not separated as they have been. Except for this the text, as corrected, seems to have been very carefully set up. I was sorry to hear from Mr. Pound that you had to have an operation after all. 5 I hope it went off quite successfully and that you will not have more trouble with your eyes. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1339 May 31st 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce A little time ago Mr. Pound mentioned that you had an attack of glaucoma and later that you had written him a card. I had never heard of glaucoma and have learnt only lately what a very serious and dangerous disease it is. If it would not hurt you to send me a card I would like to know how you are now and what the prospects are. I enclose three notices from papers that had written for your book. The press cutting agency should send you a cutting from The Challenge , an English church paper. I had a letter yesterday from Mr. Huebsch in which he said he had just received through Mr. Pinker a list of corrections made by you for the second edition of your book. I am glad you were able to make them yourself. I had thought it might hurt your eyes. Mr. Huebsch said that unfortunately they were too late for the second American edition but they can be used for a second English edition if it is wanted — as I think it will be. Sixty eight copies of the book have been ordered this month: an improvement on last month. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1340 June 29th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce Many thanks for your letter. I am glad to hear that you are rather better even though the progress is very slow and apparently will continue so. I hope you will not have a relapse again. Ever since August 1914 Mr. Leigh Henry, for whose address you ask, has been a prisoner of war (civilian) in Germany. His address when he last wrote — several months ago — was | Baracke 3, Box 10 | Engländerlager Ruhleben | Germany. | I think it would be useful to have as many foreign notices as possible. I will send review copies to the papers you suggest: I am trying to find out who is the London correspondent of the Milan paper you mention. Mme Ciolkowska put a short notice in a French daily paper L'Intransigeant (I asked her to send you a copy) and the editor of that paper, Mr. Fernando Divoni, asked for a review copy and will, I hope, write a longer notice. Mr. de Bosschère 1 is too busy to write now, being very much occupied with some contract work. I hope, however, that we shall get a review in the Mercure de France . Mr. Pound met their London correspondent, Mr. Davray, 2 a day or two ago and he promised to review the book — but Mr. Pound says his promises are not entirely to be replied [sic] upon. Mr. Cournos, 3 who writes occasionally for the Egoist , sent a review to a Russian paper. It is good of you to give you permission for the remaining copies of the book to be sold to the American publisher if the sales become unprofitable. But I hope there will be no necessity for this. In fact we are arranging to bring out another edition in September when someone who has been with a large publisher is coming to us and should be able to push the sales. Owing to recent restrictions on the import of books the new edition is to be printed in England. (I have found a printer brave enough to do it — supported by the reviews.) I wrote to the American publisher for a copy of the corrections you sent him and hope they will arrive in a week or two. | With many kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1341 July 18th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce I enclose a letter addressed to you c/o The Egoist . Many thanks for your letter 1 and suggestions for foreign reviews of your novel. I sent copies (with copies of the May &amp; June Egoist ) to the two Geneva papers you spoke of and to Professor Olivieri 2 and Mr. Mario Borsa 3 — with letters also to the two last — though whether diplomatic or not I am not sure. It is a little difficult for the publisher also to do these things. 4 After receiving your previous letter I wrote to Mr. John Jaffé but have had no reply. I have not succeeded in tracing the London correspondent of the Corriere della Sera (Milan). The Italian press agency here does not know of anyone writing under the pseudonym of Giovanni Emanuel but said that a Mr. Canagna, who was the London correspondent of the paper, has left London and they do not know his address. Reuter's agency could tell me nothing. The Russian paper to which Mr. Cournos sent a review was the Apollon (Petrograd). He does not know on what date it appeared. I got your corrections from your agent and the printers now have the book in hand. I will send you a complete proof as soon as they come. Nine more copies of the book (completing the third dozen) were sent off to you two days ago. I hope you have recovered from the attack of tonsilitis and that your eyes are better too. You are indeed unfortunate in being troubled with such a number of illnesses: they seem to have a conspiracy not to let you alone. I suppose there are not many people who have the good fortune to be always well like me. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1342 July 31st 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce Your letter of the 18th (the one that was not lost by your absentminded daughter) 1 was rather slow in the post and as I have been away for a few days it was delayed still longer and I did not get it till last night. It is very good of you to suggest an alteration in the contract in our favour and to say that you agree in advance to anything I may propose. But as the book is to be charged at 6/— net — most of the 6/— novels published in London now are to be charged at 6/— net I am told — the increased expense with the English printing should be met in this way unless the increased price proves a hindrance to the sales. You speak of trying to get some wholesale bookseller in Zurich to take copies on sale. The export price will be 4/6; or 4/3 if a dozen are ordered. I am very glad to hear that your play Exiles is is to [ folls . del. is] be published in the autumn and wish it good success. It is pleasing to hear that you would rather it had been published by the Egoist . Your proposal that the leaflet with the press notices of your novel be inserted in the copies for sale as well as in the review copies seems to me good and I hope Mr. Richards will agree. I am uncertain whether the regulation against the import of books in quantity applies to all printed matter. I will inquire at the general post office here but probably shall not have a reply for some days. 2 I will send a copy of your novel to Dr. Pouptis at 62 Oxford Street and must get a copy of his paper with the review which I shall have to find someone to construe. 3 I have now had a letter from Mr. Jaffé who advises that a copy be sent to the Semaine Litteraire , Lausanne, as well as to the Journal de Génève and he says that he mentioned this paper to you. Are there, I wonder, the two papers of the same name or is it a case of absentmindedness on your part or on his? You had told me the Semaine Litteraire , Geneva and I sent the copy there. I shall not send one to Lausanne until I hear from you again on the matter. If I were to send out a copy of your novel would you be willing to sign it for the bookseller 4 a letter from whom I enclose? Apparently it is for himself. I had told him that if you did it you would probably want to know the name of his customer and might require a fee: I did not know. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1343 August 17th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce I have found out that the importation of copies of the extracts from the press notices of your novel will be permitted if they come through the post in parcels weighing not more than 7 lbs each. I think it would be useful if the Egoist were to have an independent supply of 1000 for insertion in copies of the paper going to new people and in copies of Mr. Eliot's small book Prufrock 1 and in Mr. Pound's Dialogues of Fontenelle which are being reprinted. If you can kindly arrange this please deduct the cost and postage from the amount of the third dozen copies of your novel. I am sorry to say a catastrophe has occurred which will cause considerable delay in the appearance of the second English edition of the book. The text is already set up (I think) but the manager who had undertaken the work has gone off on military service and his successor declines to produce the book without deletions. I shall try one or two other firms but feel rather hopeless of success. Failing an English printer we shall have to apply to the Board of Trade for permission to import sheets from America. As the first edition will soon be exhausted I think perhaps it would be better not to try for more reviews while we are unable to supply copies that might be ordered as a result. I had a card from Mr. Viderovich 2 (I think it must be he though the signature is not quite clear) from via Carona 221, Rome, saying that he will glad to review the book on the first opportunity. Dr. Olivero [sic] is keenly interested in all works of art based on lofty and pure ideals and trying to express with a beautiful style the refined psychology of our time. If your novel corresponds to these aesthetic principles he will be delighted to review it in one of the best Italian periodicals. I wonder whether you will come up to his test! | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>

      <field name="fulltext">1345 September 6th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce Many thanks for your kind message for my birthday written from the hospital and please thank Mrs. Joyce for me for her letter received this morning. 1 I am glad to know from it that you are improving after the operation though only slowly. I had imagined you were so much better that an operation would be avoided and was very sorry to hear of this new collapse. Mr. Pound told me you had written that your book Ulysses was likely to be finished in January and that you suggested its appearance as a serial in the Egoist and Little Review simultaneously. We should be very glad indeed to have it and the Egoist could pay you fifty pounds — half of it now and half of it in six months time if that you [sic] suit you. Mr. Pound suggested that I should telegraph a part of the first instalment and make it payable to Mrs Joyce in case you should still be in hospital. Two days ago therefore I telegraphed ten pounds through Cook's agency and at the same time I telegraphed to Mrs Joyce to call at their Zurich office. I hope both telegrams got through. Today I am sending with this letter a draft for fifteen pounds (328.50 francs) payable in the same way on the personal application of Mrs Joyce. I think the publication of the book as a serial would give the Egoist the right of publication later in book form but that of course could be settled entirely as you might wish at the time. I hope you would understand that if by any unfortunate chance the printers should insist on making any deletions we should be powerless to do anything. I have sufficient experience now of London printers to feel convinced it would be useless to try a change of firm. I think I have found a country printer 2 willing to print the second edition of your novel — a Southport firm which printed the Egoist till the publication was transferred to London in July 1914. I will let you know when, or if, the matter seems certain — as certain, that is, as it is possible to feel after the last disappointment. If they fail and we have to apply to the Board of Trade for permission to import sheets from America I will take your advice and ask the help of Mr. Edward Marsh of the Colonial Office. With kind regards and hoping to hear that the result of the operation is quite satisfactory | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1346 September 17th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce The printers I spoke of are setting up your novel and I think it very unlikely that the same disaster will occur again for they yielded to persuasion and made no deletions during the year in which they printed the New Freewoman and Egoist . They say that the proofs will be ready in the third of or [ folls. del. of] fourth week in October. Will you be satisfied if I read them through very carefully using your corrections for reference? This would save some weeks' delay. Also the nearer it gets to Christmas the busier the binders will be. I am afraid there would be difficulties in the way of having a small number printed and bound first. Mr. Symons 1 writes that he received no letter from you but got the book which he "admires greatly". I expect it was because you had not the correct address for the book was returned in the first instance by the post office. I looked out [sic] the address in a directory and sent it again. The right address is Island Cottage, Wittersham, Kent. I wrote some weeks ago to the bookseller Ebell asking him if he was willing to take the books at the increased price and I suggested sending him as a start seven (which are charged at the price of six and a half). He has not replied but I will reserve seven a little while longer though there are only nine other copies left and these have already been ordered by a shop that has had a large number of copies "on sale or return" and has disposed of them all. The bookseller, Mr. Frank Albert, now asks if you will sign your other two books copies of which he is getting and he offers a fee of half a guinea for the two. As you signed your novel I will send these two when they come though perhaps you will not be fit to sign them at once. Please deduct this second half guinea also from the balance on your account for the third dozen copies of your book. Mr. Pound asked me to send you a copy of Prufrock and I will send it at the same time. I am much obliged to Mrs Joyce for her cards and for the copy of the Semaine Litteraire with the notice of your book. I am sorry to hear that your recovery is so slow. You must have had a dreadful time. I shall hope to hear better news of you. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1347 November 25th 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce Proofs of the concluding pages of your novel did not arrive till yesterday. The printers have been slow but I was afraid to hurry them lest they should do the work badly. I hope you will find I have left few mistakes. All your corrections have been made, including those you asked for in your last letter. I do not know when the copies of the book will be delivered. Already there are a number of orders waiting. The signed copy of your book Dubliners reached me but not your Chamber Music which was dispatched to you at the same time. I wonder whether it reached you. When the second half guinea from Mr. Frank Albert is deducted from the 13/2 owing by you the debt is almost cancelled — and I you [ folls. del. I] do not seem to have charged for the postage of the 1000 press notices from Zurich. It was 4 frs. 50 which, I suppose, is about 4/—. If you paid this it leaves a small balance in your favour. I hope your eye is recovered now and that you can be sure that the result of the operation is quite satisfactory. And I hope the climate of Locarno will suit you better than that of Zurich did. I suppose it is very much milder. I expect your book Ulysses has been delayed and that it will not be finished as soon as you had expected. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1348 March 8th 1918 Dear Mr. Joyce I enclose draft for 525 francs (£25), the second payment from the Egoist for the serial rights of your novel Ulysses . The novel is bitter reading to me at least — difficult too, the third section — but of vital interest. I am sorry to say our printers are making difficulties over it. The first episode is in type but at the last moment before going to press for the March number they refused to print it — even with deletions. I am trying to find another firm but it will be difficult I know. I have tried the printers of the Rationalist Press Association whom you suggested some time ago but they have already as much work as they can cope with at this time. I daresay the Southport printer would do it but it would be extremely inconvenient, almost impossible, to have the Egoist printed so far away from London. A subscription came from M. Jamaints Semper. No other has come so far from Switzerland beyond the one you sent. I will send copies of the paper to Mrs Murray 1 in Dublin as soon as your novel starts. I have sent her the February number. As to sending copies every month (instead of every two months) to you and to the friends from whom you have obtained subscriptions, I am sorry but I am afraid it cannot well be done — at present at any rate — as the newsagent through whom we have to send (to neutral countries and America) makes a favour of doing it at all and is not willing to send a few copies at a time or to send frequently. Mr. Pound is well again now I think. He had influenza a little time ago. I hope your eye does not trouble you now. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1349 June 19th 1918 Dear Mr. Joyce Many thanks for your letter. I had hoped there would have been something definite to say before this as to the appearance of your novel Ulysses in the form of a supplement but the matter is still unsettled. Unfortunately Mr. and Mrs. Woolf came to the conclusion that the printing of a book of approximately the length of your first novel would be a greater undertaking then they could manage, unaided, on their small hand press. They said it would take them quite two years at the rate at which they work. They would have liked to do it as they were very much interested in the first four episodes which they read. 1 I am now waiting to hear the decision of the firm that printed your other novel but I am not altogether hopeful. If they agree, or if some other firm is found willing to print the supplement, 2 there will be no loss on the book because the extra expense of the the supplement will be offset by the fact that the type will have been set up and therefore your very kind proposal that the money paid for serial rights should be considered as an advance on royalties ultimately due is not one that could with any fairness be taken advantage of. And there is no other novel that we would like to print as a serial in place of yours. 3 The Egoist will be reduced in size by four pages which the supplement runs — it has in fact been reduced already. I wrote to your American publisher with your message. 4 Mr. Pound has sent his copy of the typescript to America and the book started in the Little Review for March. I hope all will go well with the writing of the rest of it. It is not tiresome to me to hear how your book is written: I like to hear it. 5 The sales of the second edition of your other novel are poor, I am sorry to say. Probably the six months' interval was bad for the book. You made a kind proposal in a former letter that the terms of our contract should be modified in view of the increased cost of production. 6 I would suggest therefore that the royalties be paid only on the copies sold and paid for and not also on those supplied but not yet paid for. So far, of 113 copies ordered and supplied only 40 have been paid for to date. It would be nice if the "four thousand" Mr. Pound talks of so glibly were a fact. I sent a copy to Mr. Courtney 7 some weeks ago. I think Mr. Davray will review the book soon. I shall send The Egoist to the Museums: Gesellschaft at Zurich and must thank you for having spoken to the chairman about the journal. I am glad to hear that Messrs Crès 8 have sold their copies of your book. I wrote to the three subscribers you obtained to know if they would prefer me to pass on their subscriptions to the Little Review owing to the delay over Ulysses . Mr. Semper has made his up to the amount and I have just sent it in to Mr. Pound. The other two have not replied. I am sorry that you have been threatened with trouble in your eye again and hope that the symptoms came to nothing. | With kind regards | yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1350 July 6th 1919 Dear Mr. Joyce Thanks for the letter received yesterday. 1 I think it not impossible that Mr. Grant Richards, on account of the striking reception of your first novel and because your book Ulysses has been championed by the Times (I expect you had the cutting), would be willing to publish Ulysses ; and if you would like him to see as much of it as is in typescript I hope you will say so and not feel bound to let the Egoist have it. If, however, you do give us the refusals [?] we shall be very glad to have the publishing of the book and I think we could get it printed in London. After the last number of the Egoist came out (in April) our printers gave us notice, chiefly, though not entirely, on account of Ulysses . 2 I have since made arrangements with another firm and they are bringing out the next number this week. Half of the sixth episode will appear in it; the other half in the following number. After that the paper is probably to be suspended for a time, partly in order to allow Miss Marsden some free time in which to prepare her philosophical series for publication in book form, and partly in order to develop our book publishing venture. 3 I remember mentioning this new firm in a previous letter: the manager, a Roman Catholic Irishman, had been much interested in your first novel. He has now seen the first ten chapters of Ulysses and so far as he can judge from these will be willing to print the complete text. It is difficult to know what to say about your suggestion that the book when it is finished be issued in a paper cover at a price equivalent to that current in France. I hear that English publishers are contemplating the issuing of novels in paper covers but I do not suppose that even so the price will be reduced to that of France for in this country the heaviest expense now of a long book is the setting up of the type — and at present also the paper; binding is a smaller item. Miss Marsden had made an opposite suggestion. On the theory that a book should be priced according to the worth of its contents she would like to put the price of Ulysses at a high figure and had proposed 10/6 — (some novels are selling here for 9/—). 4 I do not think that practicable but perhaps this matter could be decided nearer the time of publication when the expenses of publication may have altered. I hope that Mr. Huebsch will keep to his intention of coming to London soon: I had a letter from him too. Mr. Aldington 5 has told me vaguely something about the worries of which you speak. 6 I am very glad to know that the friendly energy of Mr. Huebsch has lessened them. Mr. Pound sent me the Sirens episode a little time ago. I think I can see that your writing has been affected to some extent by your worries; I mean that this episode seems to me not quite to reach your usual pitch of intensity. I hope you are able to make progress now with the Cyclops episode. I hope too that your health will improve when you leave what is to you the unhealthy climate of Zurich and that you will have less trouble with your eyes. Perhaps I had better add that it was I who sent the message through Messrs Monro, Saw and Co, and that I am sorry I sent it in the way and in the form I did. 7 It is rather paralysing to communicate through solicitors. I fear you will have to withdraw all words about delicacy and self effacement: I can only beg you to forgive my lack of them. | With kind regards | yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1351 August 17th 1919 Dear Mr. Joyce Many thanks for your letter 1 and for the translation of your play Exiles which reached me a day or two before I came here. Though I have forgotten nearly all the little German I ever knew I am very glad to have it and it is an added satisfaction that you should have given it to me on the day of its first production — at the Munich Schauspielhaus. 2 The two papers with the notices also reached me and I made out the gist of them with the help of a dictionary. The play seems to have puzzled the audience. I do not know why you should have been surprised that it interested me — though I think you have more scope in a novel with its freer form — in spite of the difficulties you have set yourself in Ulysses : the necessity of compressing all the wanderings into the compass of one day. 3 It is odd that your mention of any person in it should have such a fatal effect! 4 I enclose a letter from a Mr. Boynan to whom I have replied that you lately had negotiations with someone else (Mr. Bazilo) but that I did not know whether anything had been finally arranged but would ask you. Will you therefore either write to Mr. Boynan yourself or let me know what to say? I have kept his address. I think I shall be staying on here till September 2nd — to spend my birthday with my brother's family at the sea instead of in London by myself as for several years past. | With many kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1352 November 2nd 1919 Dear Mr. Joyce Your telegram from Milan reached me safely but I stupidly did not understand from it that you were giving your new address in Trieste. 1 I stupidly took it to mean that you were travelling there via some town called Sanita (a town I had never heard of) and I thought the "two" must be due to some mistake of the telegraphist. I therefore only reported to Mr. Pound that you were travelling to Trieste "via Sanita" and I hope he has not written to your old address. On receiving your letter two days ago I wrote at once to him to correct my mistake. I asked him at the same time for the episode of the Cyclops and it reached me last night. I have read it through but too hastily to venture on any comment — except the passing remark that on finishing the chapter it was difficult to speak straight and to avoid interlarding one's words with the favourite and quite unladylike adjective employed so constantly by the figure who is the narrator in this episode! 2 I noticed a number of mistakes in the typescript and I shall read it through carefully and make what corrections I can. I will send you tomorrow the two copies of your novel for which you ask. I shall send you also a small new book by Mr. Wyndham Lewis which you may perhaps be interested to see. 3 I am very sorry to hear of the misfortune that befel [sic] your flat and its contents and that you find the whole situation so discouraging. 4 The difficulty as to house accommodations seems to be very widespread. It is acute in this country and particularly so in London at present. Mr. Aldington has for months been in want of a flat and is very depressed at not being able to find one. I hope you will have better fortune soon and be less worried. | With many kind regard[s] | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1353 November 7th 1919 Dear Mr. Joyce I enclose Mr. Quinn's defence of Ulysses just received from Mr. Eliot. Mr. Quinn does not wish it to appear in The Egoist in this, its original form and so far he has not sent a revised version and I do not know whether or not he intends to do so. I think it would be well to preserve the document in case of future trouble over Ulysses on its publication in book form in this country. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1354 December 10th 1919 Dear Mr. Joyce I have sent you for Christmas, in case it should interest you to see them some photographs of myself, two new ones and an old one. The new ones are said to be good likenesses of what I am now; but they are deceptive in a way — though not, I believe, so very much more than I am myself and have been at all ages — for in reality I am old. To be precise, I was forty three on September 1st and am therefore just five years and five months older than yourself. I fancy that Mr. Pound and the rest of them except Miss Marsden imagine me to be several years younger than I am and I do not disillusion them, for, though not to bear the traces of all one's years upon one's face is scarcely a fact to be proud of, I am so weak as to allow myself the pleasure of being credited still with something of youth. In connection with this matter of age I may say that I saw your verses in the August number of the Anglo-French Review and find them very apt for myself in certain moods, especially in moods in which the thought of my great age weighs upon me and depresses me. 1 But to be more cheerful — I enclose (with this letter) an old snapshot which may perhaps amuse you. The figures are: my youngest brother, my eldest niece and myself. I hope the things I sent you last month reached you safely, in particular Mr. Quinn's splendid defence of Ulysses , of which I have no copy. If the various things that I have sent you have reached you and if you have found the posts in other ways satisfactory, perhaps you might venture soon to send me the manuscript of your book A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man . 2 I think I have expressed very little appreciation of the gift of it that you are making me: please understand that I shall value it very highly indeed. To judge from accounts there have been recently in English papers of strikes and disturbances in many Italian towns I fear the situation in Trieste can have improved little, if at all, since you wrote soon after your return there. I hope, however, that you have met with some success in your weary search for a flat. I hope too that your eyes are better now you are away from Zurich and that you have no threatening of illness this winter. | With good wishes for Christmas and kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1355 January 28th 1920 Dear Mr. Joyce I telegraphed to you last week informing you that three parcels had arrived and thanking you for them. These three followed one another closely and I waited several days in the hope that the fourth would also arrive. However, I am very glad to say that it came last night. I notice that the postmark is the 14th and presume the delay was due to the Italian postal and railway disorganization. I am doubly glad that the whole manuscript has arrived intact because, though I am touched that you should suggest copying out for me any or all of it that might fail to reach me, I should have been very sorry for you to waste your time in such a way and strain your eyes unnecessarily on my account. In view of what happened to the "original" original 1 it is fortunate that the chapters of Ulysses are typed out as soon as they are written and the typescript dispatched to safer keeping in England and America! I should certainly like to have any photographs you can send me other than those I have already: these being the one you sent me last summer (at what date it was taken I do not know, but I imagine it must have been soon after an illness for you look very pale) and one (a profile) you sent for The Egoist about three years ago at the time when you sent Mr. Huebsch the photograph with what Mr. Pound called the pathological eyes which Mr. Huebsch used for the cover of his edition of your book Chamber Music of which he sent me a copy. I do not come from any so fascinating spot as St. Ives 2 (where I have merely stayed twice) but from Cheshire — an overgrown village, Frodsham, on a flat stretch of land at the foot of a ridge of hills halfway between Chester and Warrington. My father was the doctor of the district and I lived there till I was fifteen; afterwards at Hampstead, a north London suburb, till 1914. I am afraid I am hopelessly English, unadulterated Saxon. My mother was from Lancashire — her father a cotton mill owner in the Manchester district — my father from Chester where his father had been a doctor before him. I have, by the way, cousins in Belfast (one of my father's sisters having married a Presbyterian minister there) who are violent Orangemen! But you will be bored with all this. You mention that copies of your novel reached a firm, Messrs Bemporad, but not Messrs Schimsoff. 3 But you had not asked me to send copies to either of these firms; or if you had, the letter or card was lost in the post. I can only suppose that the former firm obtained the books through an export agent: possibly through a French firm, Messrs Hachette, who, for the first time, sent for two copies of the book a few weeks ago. They sent for two more copies this morning and I inquired whether these were by any chance for Messrs Schimsoff but the messenger did not know. Please let me know if I am to send any copies, and the address. With very grateful thanks and with best wishes for your birthday | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1356 20/3/20 Dear Mr. Joyce At the suggestion of Mr. Pound I posted yesterday a copy of his book Quia Pauper Amavi and of Mr. Lewis's books Tarr and The Caliph's Design 1 to Mr. Silvio Benco in the hope of a notice in his journal. 2 If you happen to see him perhaps you could mention the matter to him. I will send him also a copy of your novel which he had not seen when he wrote about you in July 1918 and which I think he well deserves. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1357 March 27th 1920 Dear Mr. Joyce I enclose a notice of your novel just received from New Zealand. As I am uncertain what will be the order of my movements till the middle of June please address anything to me up to that date to: | 23 Adelphi Terrace House | London, W. C. 2 | and it will be forwarded. Mr. Pound tells me that he is hoping to see you before long when he goes to Italy. | With kind regards | Yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1358 May 25th 1920 Dear Mr. Joyce A copy of your novel was sent last week to the Leipzig firm, the publishers of the Tauchnitz editions. 1 I gave directions that it should go by express registered post and so hope that it will arrive without much delay. I do not think that The Egoist has any continental rights over the book, but in any case, of course, we would not exercise them under present conditions when the rate of exchange makes the price of English books prohibitive to continental buyers. Many thanks for sending me the first act of Esuli . 2 I hope that the complete book will be published later in volume form in Milan. The two copies of Mr. Benco's article on Tarr which you were so kind as to send off have not yet reached me though I have written to my assistant for them. Perhaps they have been delayed in the post. Mr. Pinker sent me the agreement he had drawn up for Ulysses . Perhaps you will allow the question of the price to be discussed later. English readers do not now expect to obtain a new novel for 6/—: indeed the mind of the British public appears to be such that the higher the price of an article the greater the value attached to it. There could perhaps be a Tauchnitz edition of this book also afterwards so that your desire for a low priced book for the continent could be met. I am sorry that Mr. Pound had to leave Venice hastily for the Lake of Garda without seeing you. He had told me that he intended to go to Trieste. I suppose that the Oxen of the Sun episode, now being typed you say, concludes the second part of Ulysses (the Odyssy [sic]) for I remember that you told me that the book would contain seventeen episodes in all, three in the last part. 3 I leave this address (my brother-in-law's) this week and go to my aunts in Frodsham where I shall probably remain till I am able to get back to London, about June 21st. Many thanks for your kind inquiries about my aunt. The operation was successful; but in her case there were no complications and it was therefore not so difficult as in yours — nor was the ordeal so dreadful, though bad enough. | With kind regards | yours sincerely</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1359 Dear Mr. Joyce I am glad to say that the copies of Mr. Silvio's Benco's article on Tarr , so kindly sent by you, reached me today. Many thanks also for the copy of Poesia 1 received by the same post. I like your verses. | With kind regards | 1/6/20</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * I am grateful to Mr. George Healey, curator of rare books at the Cornell University Library, for giving me permission to publish from the Mennen collection. I want also to acknowledge the late Miss Weaver's granting permission to Robert Scholes of the University of Iowa to publish these letters, and I want to thank Professor Scholes for allowing me to edit the letters and for his guidance in this work. Finally I wish to thank the University of Delaware for a summer research grant whose result is this edition. 1 Thomas Franklin Grant Richards, publisher of Dubliners (1914), whose contract with Joyce gave him the right to examine Joyce's further works for publication. Richards decided on May 18, 1915 not to accept Portrait . See Richard Ellmann's James Joyce (New York, 1959), pp. 395, 413. Also see Robert Scholes' "Grant Richards to James Joyce," Studies in Bibliography , XVI (1963), 158-9. 2 The serial publication of Portrait began in the Egoist in February 1914 and continued (except for the issues of September 15, October 1 and 15, November 2 and 16, 1914, when Joyce could not mail the manuscript from Austrian territory, and the "Special Imagist Number," May 1915) until September 1915. 3 c/o Gioacchino Veneziani, Murano, Venice, a forwarding address Joyce used in order to receive mail from England while he was in Austria (Trieste). 4 Joyce declined Miss Weaver's offer to send the Egoist , presumably because he wished to wait until he had settled in Switzerland. He replied (30 April 1915), "It would give me great pleasure to receive them and read them but there are many obstacles in the way." Letters of James Joyce , ed. Stuart Gilbert (New York, 1957), p. 80. 1 Joyce had written (30 April 1915), "I suppose my novel has now come to an end," and in his reply to this letter (12 July 1915) he said, "As you ask me I think it would be better if the instalments of my novel could be made a little longer so as to finish the serial publication a little earlier than November." Gilbert, pp. 82, 83. 1 Messrs. Partridge and Cooper omitted the second paragraph of Chapter III, the one concerning Dublin's red light district, beginning, "It would be a gloomy secret night," and ending, "Coming in to have a short time?" Portrait (New York, 1964), p. 102. Also in the italicized phrase "My excellent friend Bombados," they substitute "Pompados." Portrait , p. 105. 2 In the fourth chapter of Portrait Messrs. Partridge and Cooper quailed at part of Joyce's description of the envoy from the fair courts of life. They omitted the sentence, "Her thighs, fuller and softhued as ivory, were bared almost to the hips where the white fringes of her drawers were like featherings of soft white down." Portrait , p. 171. 3 Messrs. Ballantyne, Hanson and Co. omitted these lines from the portion of Chapter V in the Egoist , II, No. 8 (August 1915): "The stout student who stood below them on the steps farted briefly. Dixon turned towards him saying in a soft voice: — Did an angel speak?" The word "also" was omitted from the subsequent line for the sake of continuity. Portrait , p. 230. Ballantyne twice substitutes two asterisks for the word "ballocks" ( Portrait , p. 231), and misprints the phrase "Lead him home with a sugan" ( Portrait , p. 236) as "Lead him home with sugar." Still, Ballantyne continued as the Egoist's printer until February 1916, when Spottiswoode and Co. took up the job. Spottiswoode printed only two numbers, and the Egoist was thereafter printed by The Complete Press, of West Norwood. 4 James B. Pinker, a London agent who became Joyce's representative in April 1915. 1 Dora Marsden, founder of the Freewoman (1911) which became the New Freewoman (1913) and finally the Egoist (1914), was the editor of the magazine until June 1914 when Harriet Weaver became editor. Miss Marsden, as "contributing editor," continued to write lengthy lead articles on philosophical and political topics. 1 The London publisher Martin Secker turned down Portrait . Mr. Pinker next tried Duckworth who refused the novel in December 1915. 1 Madame Muriel Ciolkowska, the Egoist's Paris correspondent, whose columns "Fighting Paris" and "Passing Paris" appeared regularly, and who arranged with her sister in Switzerland for earlier manuscripts of Portrait to reach London from Trieste for the serial publication. 2 Joyce wrote to Pinker (6 December 1915) advising him to accept Harriet Weaver's offer to publish Portrait . "I agree to this proposal if you do. I dislike the prospect of waiting another nine years before my next book appears — with the result which you know. . . . In any case Miss Weaver's proposal is most friendly and I beg you to consider it." Gilbert, p. 87. 3 Poèmes par André Spire . 1 Joyce's letter of 22 January 1916. He offers to telegraph again "on receipt of the second remittance." Gilbert, p. 89. 1 Joyce replied (10 March 1916) that he would trust the proofreading to Ezra Pound, or if Pound could not that a reader be found, "the fee in the latter case being charged to me." If, on the other hand, Miss Weaver were to send proofs to Zurich, Joyce promised to correct and return them in a day, "if the attack of rheumatism from which I am suffering does not go to my eyes." Gilbert, pp. 89-90. 2 "I have no preference," Joyce answered. Gilbert, p. 89. 3 A contract settling publishing rights for Portrait , in which Mr. Pinker was to "accept unconditionally, subject to his commission of 10%, whatever terms you [Harriet Weaver] propose." Gilbert, p. 89. Pinker wrote to Joyce on March 23 that he had drawn up such an agreement with Miss Weaver. His letter, Cornell No. 987. 1 Turnbull and Spears. 2 In his letter to Miss Weaver (17 March 1916) Pound had written, "If all printers refuse. . . I suggest that largish blank spaces be left where passages are cut out. Then the excisions can be manifolded (not carbon copies, but another process) by typewriter on good paper, and if necessary I will paste them in myself. The public can be invited to buy with or without restorations and the copyright can be secured on the book as printed . That is to say the restorations will be privately printed and the book-without-them 'published.' And damn the censors." The Letters of Ezra Pound , ed. D. D. Paige (New York, 1950), pp. 74, 75. 3 Joyce notified Mr. Pinker of Pound's plan (31 March 1916) and said, "I agree to this or any scheme by which the book shall be published as I wrote it and as quickly as possible." Gilbert, p. 91. 4 Pound also told Miss Weaver, "As for early or late in the season, I think that is all nonsense in connection with a book of this sort. If it were to be sold by Smith and the other barrators, or if it were to go through the usual channels of corruption there would be some reason for consulting their times and seasons. But a book like this which the diseased and ailing vulgar will not buy can take its own course." Paige, p. 74. 1 One of the American publishers was John Marshall. Pound wrote to Harriet Weaver (30 March 1916), "I have just written him direct a very strong letter re Joyce, advising him to print the Joyce in preference to my book [ This Generation ], if his capital is limited. . . . [Send] the leaves of The Egoist containing the novel and also the bits the printer cut out. He may as well have it all, and at once while my letter is hot in his craw." Paige, p. 75. 2 Miss Weaver refers to the last section of the lead article in the Egoist , III, No. 3 (March 1, 1916), 34-35, signed "H. S. W.," which deals with Portrait 's publication difficulties and also announces "we propose to publish [ Portrait ] ourselves." 1 Byrceson Treharne, a Welsh composer who set poem XXXVI from Chamber Music , was a fellow internee with the music critic Leigh Henry in Ruhleben, a German detention camp for enemy non-combatants.

Gilbert, pp. 91-2. 1 Joyce made this suggestion in a letter (16 September 1916), in Gilbert, pp. 95-6. 1 Francis Hackett. 2 Joyce said he did not remember Hackett. Gilbert, p. 97. 1 The letter from Huebsch requests Miss Weaver to send him "a portrait of Joyce and as much biographical material and items of interest concerning him as possible," and a copy of Chamber Music . 1 Pound's article appeared after the publication of Portrait .

The reference for which Harriet Weaver is grateful occurs in a paragraph on Ezra Pound.

Virginia Woolf, A Writer's Diary (London, 1953), p. 363. 2 Miss Weaver's plan was to find another printer to print Ulysses in installments which would be sold along with the regular Egoist as supplements. 3 Joyce had written (18 May 1918) telling Miss Weaver not to feel obligated to the serial publication of Ulysses ("I beg you not to consider any imaginary claims of mine.") and suggested she might print another book in serial form. Gilbert, p. 114. 4 Joyce asked Miss Weaver to tell Huebsch that he would not be able to send a complete typescript of Ulysses by autumn. 5 Joyce had outlined his plans for the various episodes in Ulysses and then apologized for having done so, "This subject I am sure must be rather tiresome to you."

Part of the "Wandering Rocks" episode appeared in the December number, pp. 74-78, the Egoist 's last issue. 3 Patricia Hutchins records Miss Weaver's having said in an interview, "The problem of keeping The Egoist going had been a hard one and partly for this reason and partly from the incompatibility of its two sides, the philosophic, represented by Miss Marsden whose editorials were found by many subscribers to have become too abstruse for easy reading, and the literary, the appeal of which was wider, it was decided to suspend publication at the end of 1919 and concentrate on book publication." James Joyce's World (London, 1957), p. 120. The Egoist magazine was discontinued in December 1919, but the Egoist as a publishing company continued until 1924, even finally succeeding in coming out with an edition of Ulysses printed in France from Sylvia Beach's plates in 1922. 4 Joyce replied (6 August 1919), "While I thank Miss Marsden for the compliment she pays me, I should prefer to see my book ( Ulysses ) priced at 3/ — which is about its value, I think."

Miss Weaver tells Joyce here for the first time that she is the anonymous donor of this gift and others handled by Monro, Saw and Co. since early 1917. 1 Gilbert, pp. 129-30. 2 August 7, 1919. 3 Miss Weaver is paraphrasing from Joyce's letter of 6 August 1919.

And in the subsequent letter (6 August 1919), "In confirmation of what I said in my last letter I enclose a cutting from a Dublin paper just received, announcing the death of one of the figures [J.

Chester Anderson and Richard Ellmann. 1 "The 'original' original I tore up and threw into the stove about eight years ago [1911] in a fit of rage on account of the trouble over Dubliners ," Joyce wrote Miss Weaver (6 January 1920).

      <field name="heading_text">The Manuscript of The Sound And The Fury: The Revisions in the First Section by Emily K. Izsak</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From 1955 to 1962 William Faulkner several times gave public interviews, and during them he was often questioned about the composition of The Sound and the Fury . Basically his answer was always the same, that the novel had begun with an image of a little girl's muddy drawers up in a tree, and that he had then intended the first part of the novel, devoted to Benjamin Compson, as a short story. Subsequently, he said, he tried telling the story from the points of view of Quentin and Jason, and finally, in the fourth section, from his own. The details of each reply vary a little, but in all the accounts it is clear that this work in its early stages was not intended to be a novel. 1 The manuscript contains the four sections, with the dates, and in the sequence described by Faulkner. 2 Collation with the first edition reveals the authority of his statements concerning the composition of the novel, primarily by showing that the final form was the product of extensive revision, in the form of the addition of links connecting the parts of the novel. These were added after the completion of the manuscript, in the first section, in order to establish connections between it and sections three and four. 3 The manuscript of the second part of the novel, devoted to the reverie of Quentin Compson, stands apart from the plan to bind together the four sections. In it collation reveals major changes of two types. Echoes of Faulkner's reading of several authors are clearer in the manuscript than in the first edition, 4 and it appears also that he was reworking the themes and style of earlier work. Secondly, both paragraphs and the use of italics differ radically from their appearance in the first edition. 5 The collation of the third section of the novel shows that in several instances one paragraph in the manuscript was divided into two in the first edition. Minor changes of wording make it likely that a slight shift of emphasis necessitated the break. A long passage in which Jason discovers his anti-semitism (JC: 237f.; ML: 209f.) has been omitted, and also the passage in which he waits for his mother to burn Caddy's check (JC: 272f.; ML: 236f.). In the fourth section the number of paragraphs was also slightly increased after the completion of the manuscript. Frequently, as in the two paragraphs describing the Reverend Shegog (JC: 367; ML: 310), the manuscript shows a single paragraph, and the first edition a division between a paragraph containing straight description and one in which dialogue is mixed with further description. The responses of the audience to the sermon are italicized in the manuscript, where they appear in the middle of long paragraphs; in the book (JC: 369f.; ML: 311f.) the responses appear as separate paragraphs. This paper will deal with revisions in the first section, where the transformation of four stories into a novel is to be seen primarily and perhaps only. 6 Collation of the manuscript and first edition shows that one type of revision, made after the completion of the fourth section and before the novel was typed, transformed the first section from an independent narration into one which precisely anticipates the third and fourth sections. A second type found in the first section concerns a small change in the characterization of Benjamin and an overall revision of Negro diction, so as to distinguish it from Negro dialect in the other three sections. Both types are so consistent and extensive as unlikely to be merely random polishing. The first type of revision reveals that the apparent Christian symbolism in the characterization of Benjy is closely related to the final development of Dilsey's character, in the fourth section, and limited by her understanding of a Christian life. All mention of Benjamin's thirty-third birthday and Dilsey's celebration of it with a cake are entirely missing in the manuscript. The long passages omitted occur on these pages: JC: 1f., 18f., 68-70; ML: 23f., 36, 75-77; and there are also two shorter omissions, JC: 60 and 73; ML: 68 and 79. One example of a longer omission will suffice to characterize them all. Ms fol. 6 "Now, just listen at you," Luster said. "What he moaning about now?" "Lawd knows," Luster said. "He just starts like that. Hush!" Come back here." "Hush, you old looney!" Luster said. "You want me to whup you?" "I bet you will." "Hush!" Luster said. "Aint I tole you you cant go up there? Come on here, git in the water and stop that." He came and took off my shoes and rolled up my trousers and I hushed and got in the water JC: 18-19; ML: 36-37 "Now, just listen at you." Luster said. "Hush up." "What he moaning about now." "Lawd knows." Luster said. "He just starts like that. He been at it all morning. Cause it his birthday, I reckon." "How old he." "He thirty-three." Luster said. "Thirty-three this morning." "You mean, he been three years old thirty years." "I going by what mammy say." Luster said. "I don't know. We going to have thirty-three candles on a cake, anyway. Little cake. Wont hardly hold them. Hush up. Come on back here." He came and caught my arm. "You old loony." he said. "You want me to whip you." "I bet you will." "I is done it. Hush, now." Luster said. "Aint I told you you cant go up there. They'll knock your head clean off with one of them balls. Come on, here." He pulled me back. "Sit down." I sat down and he took off my shoes and rolled up my trousers. "Now, git in that water and play and see can you stop that slobbering and moaning." I hushed and got in the water and Roskus came and said to come to supper and Caddy said , A consideration of the late addition of the birthday passages is particularly relevant to the interpretation of the symbolic significance of Benjy's age, and to all of the Christian aspects of the novel. 7 Their late addition does not reduce their importance in later versions of the first part, but it does suggest a high degree of deliberation, which is consistent with Faulkner's own evaluation of the Christian references in the novel — that they are important but not primarily for their religious character. At the University of Virginia he was asked whether they represented "conscious attempts." In his reply he repeated that he was trying to tell the story of Caddy, and that the coincidence of Benjamin's age with Christ's at the time of his death was "just one of several tools." 8 Since Dilsey's Christianity is revealed to a large degree by her actions, and especially in the first section very little by what she says, it is considerably more elusive than emphasis on Benjamin's age alone might lead one to believe. Most of the birthday passages concern her celebration of the event with a cake and suggest an attitude that is emotional and even nostalgic. 9 At some time Faulkner cancelled a passage which would have made her seem more verbally self-assertive. In the scene in which Mrs. Compson drives to the graveyard with Benjy and T. P. (JC: 9-13; ML: 29-32), Dilsey, in the manuscript, gives an explanation of Roskus' rheumatism, Versh's being at work because there is not enough for Roskus alone to do on the place, and the consequent necessity for Miss Cahline to accept T. P. as a driver (Ms fol. 3). The speech would have been out of place, because it makes Dilsey into a scold, as the long series of her commands and threats throughout the first section does not. A second example of the same type of revision is the addition to the first section of all the passages having to do with the traveling show. It has the greatest implications for characterization in the third part of the novel: Quentin runs away from school to spend the afternoon with one of the show men; Jason makes himself sick chasing them about the countryside during the hottest part of the day; and Luster receives a cruel defeat when before his eyes Jason burns two tickets in the kitchen stove. The largest number of these revisions concerns Luster's finding the quarter he has lost, or selling a golf ball, in order to go to the show. In the manuscript Benjamin helps to hunt for golf balls, and he is warned not to get his head knocked off by one. In the manuscript also Luster has found a golf ball, which he wants to take home so that he will not lose it. But only in the typescript and printed version does Luster think of selling the ball in order to earn the price of admission to the show. All the passages which concern his going to the show, selling the golf ball, or finding either the lost quarter or the ball in order to sell it, are missing in the manuscript. These passages occur on: JC 2 ( ML 23), 17 (35), 23 (40), 42 (54f.), 60-62 (68f.), 65 (72f.), 68f. (75), 72 (78), 81f. (85f.), 89 (91), 91 (93). (The upper sections of pages JC: 17; ML: 35, down to "'What does you do when he start bellering.'" correspond to folio 5, missing from the manuscript, but the discussion of the lost quarter continues beyond that point on the page.) Two of the passages of added dialogue indicate a connection among the show, the quarter, and the birthday celebration, and make it appear likely that revisions were undertaken only after the completion of the fourth section. The ball for which Luster has been hunting is connected with his going to the show in a long passage added to the scene on JC: 65; ML: 72. Ms fol. 24 They came to the flag. The boy took it out, and they hit with the sticks. They put the flag up again and the boys went on and they went to the table and he got on it, with his stick. "Fore, Caddy," he said. "I'll declare," Luster said . . . . In the first edition this passage has been greatly expanded: They came to the flag. He took it out and they hit, then he put the flag back. "Mister." Luster said. He looked around. "What." he said. "Want to buy a golf ball." Luster said. "Let's see it." he said. He came to the fence and Luster reached the ball through. "Where'd you get it." he said. "Found it." Luster said. "I know that." he said. "Where. In somebody's golf bag." "I found it laying over here in the yard." Luster said. "I'll take a quarter for it." "What makes you think it's yours." he said. "I found it." Luster said. "Then find yourself another one." he said. He put it in his pocket and went away. "I got to go to that show tonight." Luster said. "That so." he said. He went to the table. "Fore, caddie." he said. He hit. "I'll declare." Luster said . . . . Two short phrases in the portion of the scene which follows accommodate the tone of the whole passage to the addition, and provide a reason for Luster's sudden cruelty to Benjy. The phrases missing in the manuscript are: "That white man hard to get along with." Luster said. "You see him take my ball." (JC: 65; ML; 73) and: "Hush up. I the one got something to moan over, you aint. Here." (JC: 66; ML: 73) By the addition of dialogue and one speaker to a scene already present in the manuscript Faulkner rather simply transformed the passage to make it serve the scheme of anticipation. As a child, Luster naturally seeks an escape from the drudgery of minding Benjy. The eleven passages added to the manuscript show him throughout the day clinging to his hope for entertainment; their effect is to increase the emotional intensity of the brief scene in the third part during which Jason burns the tickets. Our attitude to Jason has also been prepared by the addition to the first section of a single passage in which he discusses the lost quarter with Luster. . . . Luster said, "Mr. Jason." "What." Jason said. "Let me have two bits." Luster said. "What for." Jason said. "To go to the show tonight." Luster said. "I thought Dilsey was going to get a quarter from Frony for you." Jason said. "She did." Luster said. "I lost it. Me and Benjy hunted all day for that quarter. You can ask him." "Then borrow one from him." Jason said. "I have to work for mine." He read the paper. (JC: 81f.; ML: 85f.) A secondary effect of this passage is to minimize Jason's positive qualities. Some of his phrases, in the third section, are a gross version of the epigrammatic wit of his father, and one can sympathize with much of his feeling of having been cheated of opportunity. In the long run, however, the sympathy one might have felt is converted into amusement and moral censure, because Faulkner has chosen to emphasize in the first section of the novel only two aspects of his character as a child: the image of the small fat boy with his hands constantly in his pockets, and after the revision of the manuscript, literal emphasis on his tight-fistedness. The part played by Quentin in the third section required, it would seem, little anticipation. Thus Faulkner added only two brief passages to her characterization as a pitiable and untrustworthy girl. These phrases were added to the scene in which Mrs. Compson drives to the cemetery: "Quentin." Mother said. "Dont let" "Course I is." Dilsey said. and in the next paragraph: "I'm afraid to go and leave Quentin." Mother said. "I'd better not go. T.P." (JC: 10; ML: 30) Immediately following the passage concerning Jason and Luster quoted in the last paragraph occurs this addition to the manuscript: "What did I tell you I was going to do if I saw you with that show fellow again." he said. Quentin looked at the fire. "Did you hear me." Jason said. "I heard you." Quentin said. "Why dont you do it, then." "Dont you worry." Jason said. "I'm not." Quentin said. Jason read the paper again. (JC: 82; ML: 86) The parallel between the behavior of Caddy and Quentin, however, existed in the manuscript. Quentin sits on the swing with her lover, just as her mother had done, and the two scenes in which Benjamin interrupts each couple occur in sequence in both the manuscript and the first edition. (JC: 56-62; ML: 65-69) In the manuscript Luster and Benjamin also watch Quentin climb down the tree at night (JC: 90-91; ML: 92). Quentin's absolute unreliability, a quality tempered in Caddy by her devotion to Benjy, was thus already clear. The additions to the first section concerning her anticipate the part she plays in relation to the show, but they do not amplify her character sufficiently either to divert attention from Jason, or to diminish the comic aspects of the chase, in the third section. Two passages missing in the manuscript connect the finding of the ball and the show, with Benjy's birthday celebration. The dialogue between Luster and Quentin's "show man" (JC: 59-62; ML: 67-69) is considerably lengthened by the addition of the passage which runs from "'Is,' he said. 'How long's he been that way.'" to "'I didn't think you did.' Luster said." In the added portion Luster informs the young man that Benjamin is thirty-three years old that day, and then immediately inquiries if he is the man who can play the tune on the saw. "'It'll cost you a quarter to find that out.'" he is told (JC: 60f.; ML: 68f.). Luster then tries, without success, to sell him the golf ball he is carrying with him. The additions to the manuscript evident from a comparison with JC: 68-73; ML: 75-79 include four of paragraph length, and four more of approximately a sentence or two. One of the longer omissions shows Luster and Dilsey discussing both the birthday and the show. The manuscript reads: Ms fol. 25 "You didn't do nothing to his flowers?" Dilsey said "I aint touched his graveyard." Luster said "What I want with his things? I aint going to have no traffic with him." "You going to do just what he want you to, nigger boy," Dilsey said. "You hear me?" and the first edition: "You aint done nothing to his flowers." Dilsey said. "I aint touched his graveyard." Luster said. "What I want with his truck I was just hunting for that quarter." "You lost it, did you." Dilsey said. She lit the candles on the cake. Some of them were little ones. Some were big ones cut into little pieces. "I told you to go put it away. Now I reckon you want me to get you another one from Frony." "I got to go to that show, Benjy or no Benjy." Luster said. "I aint going to follow him around day and night both." "You going to do just what he want you to, nigger boy." Dilsey said. "You hear me." (JC: 68; ML: 75) The combination of allusions to the birthday celebration and the show naturally draws attention to the contrast between Jason's and Dilsey's ideas of generosity and of their responsibility to dependents. Nevertheless the number of passages which makes this connection is small in comparison to the total number of references to the show in the first section, so that one could hardly say that Faulkner was deliberately building up, during revision, a structure of thematic contrast among the various characters. One cannot fail to be impressed by the skill and apparent ease with which Faulkner made these additions. Long passages were inserted with no more rewording of the surrounding sentences than can be observed anywhere in the manuscript. While working on the first section, Faulkner was already in the habit of making long marginal insertions: 10 for example, nearly all of page JC: 51f.; ML: 62 was inserted in the wide left margin of the manuscript, and the passage into which it was set is only lightly revised. Several series of pages in the first and second sections were renumbered so as to indicate both relocation of certain passages, and a general expansion of the manuscript. Although other types of revision did call for a great deal of cancellation of single words and phrases, the expansion of the manuscript so as to anticipate the last two sections did not. The style of the first section helps to explain the ease with which additions to the manuscript could be inserted. Even the scenes which Benjamin recalls in the first person are composed of the dialogue of other characters, so that their roles could be expanded without much effect on our conception of Benjamin himself. The speeches are non-sequential, in the sense that emotionally defined subjects occur and reoccur, with a resulting decrease of emphasis on the paragraph with an exclusive structure, or on logical dialogue. For example, Dilsey asks Luster why he cannot keep Benjamin away from Quentin. In the manuscript the passage reads: Ms fol. 24 "Dont you know she aint got no time for him?" "Got as much time for him as I is," Luster said. "He aint none of my uncle." This question and answer contain a kind of logic foreign to the style, and in the printed version the passage has been revised so that the question reads: "'Dont you know she dont like him where she at.'" (JC: 67; ML: 74). One may observe, however, that the number of italicized passages about doubled when the manuscript was typed, and more passages continued to be italicized even after the printer had set the galleys. 11 Most of the added italics occur in short passages, although neither the group found in the manuscript nor the later additions concerns a special character or event. The complex time scheme of the first section thus apparently was not disordered by the inclusion of a considerable amount of new material. In fact the letter to Ben Wasson concerning the means of indicating time shifts in Benjamin's monologue 12 shows that Faulkner intended the italics primarily as an accommodation for the reader. With the exception of the birthday passages, very few of the revisions of the first section directly concern Benjamin, and those which do point to the creation in him of a special kind of character, composed of a deliberately limited number of human responses. For example, the transfer of sensory experience from one organ to another represents one kind of addition. The references to Caddy's smelling like trees (originally, like leaves), to Benjamin's smelling Damuddy's funeral, to father's smelling like rain, and Versh like rain and dogs, are all present in the manuscript. But the two passages in which Benjamin says, "I could smell the cold" and "I could smell the bright cold" (JC: 5; ML: 26) are not. Similarly, the references to Benjamin's hearing the dark, and to his hands' seeing Caddy's slipper are also missing (JC: 88f., 92; ML: 91, 93, 94). A paragraph near the end of the first section which in the manuscript reads: Ms fol. 32 She smelled like trees. In the corner by her the dresser it was dark, but I could see the windows a little, and I held the slipper and squatted there. by . . . dresser was revised to read, in the first edition: She smelled like trees. In the corner it was dark, but I could see the window. I squatted there, holding the slipper. I couldn't see it, but my hands saw it, and I could hear it getting night, and my hands saw the slipper but I couldn't see myself, but my hands could see the slipper, and I squatted there, hearing it getting dark . (JC: 88f.; ML: 91) It is not merely that Benjamin depends to a great degree on information derived directly from the senses, but even the divisions of that world are fewer than in the scientific model of ordinary human perception. 13 Probably in the interests of consistency in Benjamin's characterization, Negro speech in the first section of the novel was revised so as to reduce somewhat its colloquial character, a tendency which may be observed by comparing revisions of the dialogue there with the relatively unrevised diction of the speech in the fourth or any other section. 14 The table which follows is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to show the variety of words and speakers affected, and the care with which Faulkner singled out certain kinds of words wherever they appeared in the manuscript. JC page and line ML page and line Ms fol. Word Speaker 6.18 27.14 2B No'm/Nome Versh 11.4 30.22 3 git/get T.

Faulkner has taken care not to denature Negro speech, but merely to subordinate somewhat its regional qualities to the consciousness constructed for Benjamin. The Sound and the Fury was inspired by the image of Caddy as a child, and conceived of as her story. None of the revisions of the first section directly concerns her character or her image. Revisions which concern Luster or Quentin, for example, affect the degree of their involvement in the major actions of the novel. As an image, Caddy cannot, of course, be so involved, which may account for the fact that until she is engaged in action by Quentin, in the second section, she remains unchanged, Faulkner's "heart's darling." Faulkner's attitude toward Benjamin, whom he usually discussed as a device, sharply contrasts with the emotional statements he habitually made about Caddy. He said, for example, "The only emotion I can have for Benjy is grief and pity for all mankind. You can't feel anything for Benjy because he doesn't feel anything. The only thing I can feel about him personally is concern as to whether he is believable as I created him." 15 The revisions which concern Benjamin, the addition of the birthday passages, the increased emphasis on his isolation, and the revisions of the diction of the speech he hears, are consistent with this attitude. 16 Since this paper concerns only a portion of the whole novel, the concluding remarks must be considered tentative. Although the connections between sections one and three are the most numerous, they suggest an idea of anticipation which seems highly conventional: that is, in the interests of economy of effect, it was wise to prepare before-hand for the traveling show, the event which deeply absorbed the Compson family in Jason's narrative. Moreover the show cannot be described as an experience, in the sense of being understood by the characters, and it is relatively bare of symbolic suggestion. While it is true that the hunger of Quentin and Luster for glamour is revealed by its tawdry attraction, the question may be raised, to what extent thematic links, between two parts of a novel one of which employs a chronological time scheme, in themselves provide a real departure from conventional narrative. Secondly, one might question why connections between the first and second sections scarcely exist. The fact that the events in Quentin's section occur eighteen years earlier is one possibility. Another is that the task of creating precise thematic links between two sections neither of which was written in chronological form might have been a much more complex undertaking. Although the relationship between sections one and four is probably the most fruitful for discussion, a final interpretation seems far from clear. Are the values of love and innocence, embodied in the two main figures of the static world in the first section, demonstrated in the actions of Dilsey on Easter Sunday? If so, the idea of innocence which Benjamin represents, since it is not specifically Christian, seems arbitrarily to anticipate, by the mere coincidence of his age with Christ's at the time of the Crucifixion, the events of Easter. At the same time, the revisions which establish the relationship between one and four differ from those concerned with the show, in that Faulkner attempted to provide a sphere of expanding significance for one aspect of the novel, the idea of innocence represented in the character of Benjy. Insofar as he wished to allow the symbolic suggestions of character to assume a significance comparable to characterization itself, this aspect of revision may be said to resemble other experiments with form in the modern novel. One might conclude that the structure of the novel appears to depend mainly on thematic connections among three of the four sections. Ulysses , with which The Sound and the Fury has often been compared as an experimental novel, differs essentially in composition and form: it was written with an overall plan in mind from the beginning, and although revisions in the service of motif were always important, exclusively so in late stages of the work, other types of revision linked one episode with another by alterations throughout the work, rather than in one episode solely. 17 In comparison, the expansion of Benjy's section so as to anticipate later portions of the novel does not seem a radical treatment of form, and the manuscript in general suggests a simpler scheme of revision.</field>

Blotner, edd., Faulkner in the University (1959), pp. 1-2, and 84. Joseph L. Fant, III and Robert Ashley, edd., Faulkner at West Point (1964), pp. 109, 111. For example, Faulkner said during this interview that the novel had begun with an image of Caddy's muddy drawers, and that he had thought it was going to be "a ten-page short story. The first thing I knew I had about a hundred pages. I finished, and I still hadn't told that story. So I chose another one of the children, let him try. That went for a hundred pages, and I still hadn't told that story. So I picked out the other one, the one that was the nearest to what we call sane to see if maybe he could unravel the thing. He talked for a hundred pages, he hadn't told it, then I let Faulkner try it for a hundred pages. And when I got done, it still wasn't finished, and so twenty years later I wrote an appendix to it, tried to tell that story." The skeleton of the answer is the same as on all other occasions. In this instance the variation is the description of the number of pages; the existing manuscript numbers 148 pages, and it is likely that Faulkner's use of numbers was a device to show the audience that the work expanded in scope during composition. 2 A full description of both the manuscript and the carbon typescript can be found in James B. Meriwether, "Notes on the Textual History of The Sound and the Fury," The Papers of the BSA , LVI (1962), 285-316. The typescript does differ from the first edition in some important respects, but the omissions discussed in this paper occur only in the manuscript. Quotations from the printed edition are from the first, published by Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith (New York, 1929). In the text page references to this edition are identified as JC, and are followed by page references to the more inaccurate but widely available Modern Library edition. 3 A large number of revisions of the manuscript fall under the various headings of verbal polishing. Faulkner sometimes tried a piece of dialogue or a phrase in more than one position, occasionally even assigning it first to one, then to another speaker. A few revisions make the use of certain images more consistent. A number of sentences are more rhythmic in the final version and reveal the sensitivity of Faulkner's ear to the music of speech. Finally, the changes of diction, of single words, are enormous in number. All of these revisions would properly be evaluated in a full-scale discussion of the manuscript. 4 In an undated, four-page typescript fragment, probably written sometime in the early 1930's (See Meriwether, p. 306), Faulkner spoke of himself as "still reading by repercussion the books which I had swallowed whole ten years and more ago." The effect of reading upon his style is more evident in The Sound and the Fury than in any other of his works. 5 About twenty-seven single paragraphs in the manuscript were divided, occasionally into as many as eleven, in the first edition. In each case the new paragraph signifies a shift in person, and thus serves to distinguish dialogue from conversation remembered in interior monologue. The manuscript of the second section contains only nine italicized passages. The remainder were added in the typescript and first edition, and each use of italics serves to mark a shift in time. The tendency of this type of revision is to force a distinction between Quentin's active life and the life he lived in memory. A paper dealing with these and other revisions in the second section of The Sound and the Fury is forthcoming. 6 Permission to cite passages from the manuscript has kindly been granted by Mrs. Paul Summers. I am indebted to the American Philosophical Society and to Boston University for grants to cover travel expenses. 7 Christian references are largely absent from the second section of the manuscript as well. 8 Gwynn and Boltner, p. 17; and see also p. 68. Both Faulkner's reply and the evidence from the manuscript would make a primarily doctrinal emphasis on the Christian aspects of the novel seem arbitrary indeed. 9 John Faulkner, in My Brother Bill (1963), provides information on pp. 47f. and elsewhere about Callie Barr, the Faulkner mammy who was the origin of Dilsey. 10 No manuscript of Soldiers' Pay or Mosquitoes suvives. The typescript of Mosquitoes , however, shows sixteen manuscript additions of some length, the longest about two hundred words. The manuscript of Sartoris (entitled "Flags in the Dust") shows several pages added in two places, and eight marginal additions; a few more passages were added in the margins of the typescript. 11 On the subject of the increased use of italics, see Meriwether, 298. The first italicized paragraph in the printer's sample octavo gathering, which is the second in the typescript and in the book and occurs on JC: 5; ML: 26, coincides with the first italicized paragraph in the manuscript. 12 The letter is closely paraphrased by Meriwether, 294f. 13 Benjamin's failure to make a distinction between the world and his experience of it is nicely emphasized in a small revision of the final sentence of the novel. In the first edition it reads: "The broken flower drooped over Ben's fist and his eyes were empty and blue and serene again as cornice and facade flowed smoothly once more from left to right; post and tree, window and doorway, and signboard, each in its ordered place" (JC: 401; ML: 336); and in the manuscript: ". . . cornice and [balcony deleted] wall [interlined] and facade [each deleted] flowed smoothly once more across his mind from left to right, post and tree, lamp and sign and door each in its ordered place" (fol. 148). 14 Compare, for example, these forms from the fourth section: gwine, bofe, befo, de, hit cole dis mawnin, pastuh, case (because), cuiser (curiouser), yo egvice (your advice), vilyun (villain). 15 Paris Review , XII, 40f. 16 Benjamin is not, however, a mere abstraction. An Oxford model is described by John Cullen, in Old Times in the Faulkner Country (1961), pp. 79f. 17 Information about Joyce's methods of revision is contained in Joseph Prescott's "Stylistic Realism in Joyce's Ulysses ," in A James Joyce Miscellany, Second Series , Marvin Magalaner, ed.

      <field name="heading_text">A System of Color Identification for Bibliographical Description by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The introduction of publishers' cloth in the 1820's was an unfortunate day for bibliographers, since the description of bindings has turned out to be perhaps the most troublesome aspect of the description of nineteenth- and twentieth-century books. Other parts of the description, which generally apply to earlier books as well, have become by now reasonably standardized. The bindings on earlier books, since they are products distinct from the process of publication, are not ordinarily the concern of the descriptive bibliographer; and specialists in the history of bookbinding have developed a vocabulary for dealing with them. 1 Even publishers' "bindings" (or casings), of course, are not bibliographical objects, strictly speaking, since they are not part of the letterpress. However, aside from the fact that binding variants can sometimes help to determine the priority of an issue, 2 the cloth is part of the dress in which an author's words are presented to the public, and its appearance therefore deserves to be recorded by the historian of such matters, the descriptive bibliographer. To frame in words an adequate description of a cloth binding requires essentially some kind of notation of the texture, or "grain," of the cloth and some indication of its color. The first of these problems, though by no means solved, has received a great deal more attention than the second and is much nearer solution. Michael Sadleir, in his pioneering Trollope : A Bibliography (1928), used such terms as "silk-grained" or "morocco-grained" to describe binding cloth, a gain in precision over "grained cloth" or simply "cloth," if one could visualize what the words implied; and two years later, in The Evolution of Publishers' Binding Styles, 1770-1900 , he furnished photographs of four common cloth grains (facing p. 46). Then John Carter, the other pioneer historian of edition binding, made the next step forward in Binding Variants in English Publishing , 1820-1900 (1932), with his preliminary section on "Terminology of Grains and Designs" (pp. xvi-xviii). Here he supplied a plate illustrating twelve grains and provided a table of equivalences between descriptive terms like Sadleir's and the letter designations in use by Winterbottom's, the principal supplier of book cloth. This table suggests the inevitable dichotomy in the verbal presentation of visual data: one may either use a precise, technical term, which often has little immediate meaning for the uninitiated reader, or else a more readily visualized term, which often is less exact and which breaks down when fine discriminations are needed. Carter declared his preference for the Sadleir terms — that is, "diaper" instead of "H" cloth, "sand-grain" instead of "C", and so on — but not all bibliographers have agreed with him. The two most important recent sources for photographic identifications of cloth grains represent these two approaches. Sadleir, at the end of the first volume of his great catalogue, XIX Century Fiction (1951), includes four plates showing twenty-four grains and giving them descriptive names; Jacob Blanck, at the front of each volume of the Bibliography of American Literature (1955- ), illustrates twenty-eight grains, assigning them the letter symbols used in the trade. 3 Either of these sets of photographs provides a basis for standardization of nomenclature, if followed scrupulously by bibliographers. Perhaps a chart should be issued making these standards more readily accessible, and perhaps bibliographers should, for precision, use both terms — such as "bold-ribbed (T) cloth." 4 When one turns to the other basic ingredient of the description of cloth, the indication of color, one is surprised to find that practically no attention has been given to the matter. In the Bibliography of American Literature , for example, the careful specification of cloth grains is in sharp contrast to this comment about color: "No attempt has been made to give other than a brief statement regarding color, and commonly accepted designations are used; variations in tone are recorded" (I, xxxiii). 5 One does not expect bibliographers who strive for precision in most respects to emphasize the casualness of their approach to color, as in these remarks: . . . where colour is concerned, we have hesitated to accept such British exoticisms as "Auricula Purple" and "Cossack Green" and have quite simply described the colours as they appeared to us in broad daylight. Rust red , olive brown , salmon pink may not stand all tests, but they function adequately for such readers as are not wholly colour-blind. When we encountered variant bindings of the same basic colour, but with differences in shading, we on occasion appealed for help to the sex which daily distinguishes colour-variations in clothing, jewellery and household goods. 6 One is not surprised, however, given the subjective nature of color descriptions produced in this casual way, to find that any two bibliographers in the past, treating the same book, have been likely to come up with two different designations of the cloth color. Thus T. J. Wise, in his Browning bibliography (1897), describes the wrappers of Pippa Passes (1841) as "yellow" (p. 7), though he explains that they are sometimes "pale cream" or "light brown"; the Broughton-Northup-Pearsall bibliography (1953), on the other hand, calls these wrappers "light apple-green" (p. 4). Similarly, J. W. Robertson (1934) sees the covers of Poe's Al Aaraaf , Tamerlane , and Minor Poems (1829) as "purple" (p. 38), while for Heartman-Canny (1943) they are "grey-blue" (p. 23). Sometimes the difference is a matter of emphasis, as when Duval (1939) designates the cloth of Aldous Huxley's On the Margin (1923) "blue-green" (p. 28) and Muir-van Thal (1927) finds it "greenish-blue" (p. 20); or when McDonald (1925) considers D. H. Lawrence's The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd (1914) to be "red" (p. 32) and The Prussian Officer (1914) to be "dark blue" (p. 35), while Roberts (1963) finds them, conversely, "dark red" (p. 24) and "blue" (p. 25). Even the relative proportions are not constant, for Hogan (1936) labels Edwin Arlington Robinson's The Man Against the Sky (1916) and Merlin (1917) equally as "maroon" (pp. 11-12), while Beebe and Bulkley (1931) say that the first is "dark maroon" and the second plain "maroon" (pp. 14-15). For Currie (1932), Booth Tarkington's In the Arena (1905) is "dark olive" (p. 53), but for Russo and Sullivan (1949) it is "sage-green" (p. 14); for Williams and Starrett (1948), Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage (1895) is "tan" (p. 18), but for H. F. West (in the Dartmouth catalogue, 1948) it is "yellow" (p. 5); for Parker (1948), Joyce's Dubliners (1914) is "plum" (p. 22), but for Slocum and Cahoon (1953) it is "dark red" (p. 12); both Stewart (1959) and Livingston (1927) agree that Kipling's The Seven Seas (1896) is "red" (pp. 136, 160), but for Martindell (1923) it is "maroon" (p. 53); for Sadleir (volume 12 of the Constable edition, 1923), Melville's Typee (1846) is "fawn" (p. 341) and Mardi (1849) is "dark green" (p. 348), but for Minnigerode (1922) the first is "yellow" (p. 102) and the second "dark brown" (p. 135). Such a list could be extended indefinitely, but the process would be pointless, since confusion of this kind is to be expected when color names are chosen on the basis of personal preference, without recourse to any set of standards. There have been only a few signs in recent years that bibliographers are beginning to be concerned about the problem. John Carter, in his ABC for Book-Collectors (1952), understated the case when he said, "There has never been much precision or uniformity in describing the colours of cloth"; but he went on to make a specific suggestion: "until we all agree to use the official Dictionary of Colour Standards , this imprecision will no doubt persist" (p. 55). The following year Patrick Cahill, in The English First Editions of Hilaire Belloc , adopted standard 381c of the British Standards Institution, Colours for Ready Mixed Paints (1948; 3rd impression, 1951), and thus described his bindings with such terms as "dovegrey" or "deep buff" or "pale-crimson." Then in 1956 Raymond Toole Stott took up Carter's recommendation in his bibliography of Somerset Maugham and used one of the British Colour Council's publications — the Dictionary of Colours for Interior Decoration (1949). Though it may seem strange to read of "hay" or "biscuit" endpapers, the experiment was, as Stott recognized, "at least a step on the way to the systematized description of colours of binding cloth" (p. 8). And it was undoubtedly more efficient and precise than the method used by Frederick T. Bason in his earlier (1931) Maugham bibliography: the binding of Of Human Bondage (1915), labeled "petrol blue" by Stott (p. 35), had been described by Bason as "dark sea-green cloth (a more distinct green than The Casuarina Tree )" (p. 33). 7 These worthy efforts, however, did not convert other bibliographers from their subjective ways. Anthony Rota, reviewing Keynes' bibliography of Siegfried Sassoon (1962), remarked that "Sir Geoffrey's treatment of colours again points the need for the adoption of a common standard for defining binding shades"; and he quoted Keynes' description of The Old Hunstman (1917) as "drab or grey-blue" (with its ambiguous or , since the two colors do not seem synonymous) and of The Daffodil Murderer (1913) as "orange" (when to Rota's eyes it is yellow). 8 That this kind of confusion has not prodded bibliographers long before now to attack the problem of color designation is remarkable. On the other hand, this neglect can perhaps partly be explained by the fact that significant nineteenth-century binding variants generally do not depend on color differences alone; books were frequently issued in several colors simultaneously, and later bindings often involved a different cloth texture as well as color. 9 But in the twentieth century color variants may be more meaningful, since the simultaneous issue of multiple colors has not been customary. In any event, there should be a precise method for describing the color of a given binding whether or not the priority of an issue depends on its specification. No bibliographer would estimate the dimensions of a leaf without using a ruler; in the same way no bibliographer should make his own subjective estimate of a color without turning to a color chart, which ought to be an equally essential part of his equipment. The point is self-evident; there should be general agreement, in the words of the reviewer of Cahill's bibliography, that "it would be a great relief to all concerned if some standard scale could be adopted." 10 The question then becomes the determination of the particular system best suited to the requirements of bibliographical description. And this decision is not to be lightly made; for any kind of standard, to serve its purpose, must be capable of wide acceptance and future applicability. At the outset, it should be possible to agree that any system selected for bibliography must meet certain minimum conditions: (1) it must contain color chips or samples which can be compared easily with book covers; (2) it must include a sufficient number of different colors to be compatible with the degree of precision required in making the kinds of distinctions between bindings that are likely to be significant under varying circumstances; (3) it must assign to each color a name (not simply a number or symbol), avoiding names so fanciful as to carry no immediate connotation; (4) it must be compact in physical form and easily portable, so that the bibliographer can conveniently carry the standards with him to the libraries in which he is working; (5) it must be inexpensive enough that it can become a standard tool in every bibliographer's possession (for it is too much to expect, even for an accepted standard, that each collection in which one works will have a copy at hand); (6) it must provide strong assurance of continued availability in the future. The number of color systems which have devised since the time of Isaac Newton is vast, 11 and it is necessary to know something about the currently available ones in order to make an intelligent choice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The fundamental scientific method for measuring or specifying a particular color was established in 1931 by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE). 12 In this system, the proportions of red, green, and blue light required to match a given color are measured with a colorimeter, and the chromaticity coordinates of the color are thus established. The Commission also defined the characteristics of the standard observer and the properties of three standard illuminants . The usual notation of a color consists of two of the chromaticity coordinates plus the luminance value as established by spectrophotometer; these tristimulus values represent dominant wave length, purity, and reflectance. For example, the color of a tomato might be expressed as follows: x = .622; y = .350; Y = 10.2%. 13 However basic this system is for scientific measurement, its disadvantages for bibliographical description are obvious. To demand that bibliographers acquire the necessary knowledge of optics would decimate their already small ranks; and the prospect of setting up shop, with delicate and expensive instruments, in each rare book room would eliminate the few that remained — if, indeed, the librarians had not already resigned. Not only is this method impractical for bibliographical purposes; it is undesirable. For the degree of accuracy attainable with a spectrophotometer is not required in a bibliographical description (and is thus wasteful of effort); in addition, it could often be actually misleading, since it would continually reveal variants, most of which (depending on the tolerances established by the manufacturer of the cloth or the dye) would have no significance to the bibliographer. To put the matter another way, if the bibliographer makes finer distinctions than those required by the adopted tolerances of the manufacturer, he may find himself recording as variants bindings which came from the same bolt of material or consecutive ones. 14 Furthermore, the notation in tristimulus terms is not one which could be readily comprehended by the readers of a descriptive bibliography. If the CIE system is not feasible for bibliographical work, the next question to ask is whether or not another more appropriate system exists which is at the same time scientifically accurate and respectable. The alternative to spectrophotometric measurement is visual comparision with material standards, such as a set of color chips (sometimes known as the "ratio method"). Depending on the selection and production of the colors represented in any given set of material standards, this approach to color specification can be very precise and is scientifically valid. Although individual perception of a color is subjective, the act of matching a color with a carefully produced standard (which can then be referred to by other persons) reduces to a minimum the effects of subjectivity. And if the color chips have been chosen to represent particular CIE specifications that will result in a systematic sampling of color space, the whole process rests on a sound scientific foundation. 15 Aside from the danger of fading, an unavoidable problem in any material standard, the principal limitation of such systems is the necessity of interpolation. Since the eye can distinguish about ten million colors and since there are theoretically an infinite number of colors in three-dimensional color space, any color atlas or set of standards must represent a selection based on some principle of organization (hence the generic term "color-order systems"); therefore, depending on the number of colors selected and the accuracy of specification required, it is sometimes necessary to estimate the relation of a given color to two of the colors in the standard. This sort of interpolation, though it can be performed skillfully with practice, remains of course a subjective matter. A material color standard for bibliography should contain enough colors that, within the limits of accuracy desired, interpolation would seldom be required; on the other hand, it should not include so many colors that the process of matching becomes time-consuming and indecisive. Color-order systems fall into three groups: (a) color-mixture (or additive) systems contain copies of colors established by mixing colored lights in particular proportions with a tristimulus colorimeter; (b) colorant-mixture (or subtractive) systems contain colors produced by mixing colorants (pigments, dyes) in various proportions; (c) color-appearance systems contain colors arrived at by means of psychological perceptions of color differences and spacing. Some systems, such as atlases printed by a screen-plate process, are intermediate, partaking of the characteristics of both the color- and colorant-mixture types. 16 The methods by which the colors are produced, however, will be of less concern to the bibliographer than the physical features and range of the resulting standards; and the three most promising systems are surveyed here with the needs of the bibliographer in mind: (1) The Munsell System — In 1905 Albert H. Munsell, a Boston artist and teacher, published a little book called A Color Notation , which he later supplemented with a Color Atlas (1915). This notation, with the system which lies behind it, is perhaps the most widely used of the color-order systems. It is readily applicable to diverse fields, and scientists often convert color information to Munsell terms; it is the system described in the Encyclopaedia Britannica's current article on "Colour" (by A. C. Hardy) and officially recommended in 1942 by the American Standards Association, and it is particularly useful for educational purposes. 17 The notation for any color contains three terms, since the eye detects three characteristics of color — hue, brightness, and saturation (parallel to the CIE tristimulus values for dominant wave length, reflectance, and purity); in the Munsell system these qualities are referred to as hue , value , and chroma . With these three "dimensions," a color solid, representing color space, can be envisioned as an irregular sphere: the axis corresponds to the value scale, from black at the south pole to white at the north; perpendicular distances from this axis indicate chroma , from gray near the axis to the pure, fully saturated color at the surface of the sphere; and planes perpendicular to the equator, passing through the axis, represent hue . 18 Ten hue segments (made up of five basic hue names) are marked off around the circumference of the equator plane: red, yellow-red, yellow, green-yellow, green, blue-green, blue, purple-blue, purple, red-purple. The axis is divided into ten steps from black to white, and the number of possible chroma steps varies with the hue and value. Any color can then be referred to in a form such as "R 4/8," in which R signifies "red," 4 means the fourth step up from black toward white along the axis, and 8 indicates the eighth step perpendicular to the axis on that value level. R 4/12 would be more fully saturated and R 4/6 less; R 5/8 would be lighter and R 3/8 darker. Each hue segment may be subdivided into ten numbered planes so that, for example, 7R 4/8 would be a yellower red than 5R 4/8, and 3R 4/8 would be more purple. This system of notation is flexible enough to accommodate theoretically an infinite number of colors (by using decimals, as in 3.7RP 8.4/3.3) but is simple enough to be immediately comprehended (without reference to a table) by anyone acquainted with it. Another advantage is that the Munsell Color Company of Baltimore publishes a wide variety of excellent color charts and atlases based on this system, 19 and the continued availability of the material is assured by the existence of a nonprofit Munsell Color Foundation, established in 1942. 20 The basic publication is the Munsell Book of Color (1929-43, and later editions), issued in both a library and a pocket edition; it is a loose-leaf book, each leaf representing a constant hue plane, with small chips illustrating the possible chroma steps on a number of value levels. The current (1960) pocket edition (7" x 4½") contains 1000 samples of a matte finish, each ⅝" x ½", and costs $90; it is more suitable for bibliographical work than the library edition, which is not so easily portable and contains glossy chips. However, the chips of the library edition are removable, which is a great advantage; and even the matte chips of the pocket edition are not so satisfactory as cloth samples would be for matching binding colors, and the price is another hindrance to the widespread adoption of either edition for bibliographical work. The same considerations would apply to the Opposite Hues Edition of 1950 ($100) and the Neighboring Hues Edition of the same year ($155), both with glossy chips. Of the many special Munsell charts ( Standards for Plastic Insulated Wire and Cable ; Plant Tissue Color Charts ; Soil Color Charts ; Rock Color Charts for the Geological Society of America; Value Scales for Judging Reflectance ), each representing a selection from the Munsell Book of Color , there is one which offers possibilities for bibliographical description — the Color Fan developed by Dorothy Nickerson for use in horticulture. 21 Convenient in size (7¾" x 1⅞"), each of the 40 hue leaves of the fan displays six or seven value steps, and the samples (1⅞" x ⅞") fill the entire width of each leaf, avoiding the usual disadvantage of nonremovable samples and greatly facilitating comparison with a binding; there are 262 colors shown and the price is $7.50. The limitation of the published Fan is that it illustrates only maximum chroma (other fans are planned to sample the sphere in other ways), so that one would be dealing only with colors on the surface of the sphere. All in all, the Munsell system has, from the bibliographer's point of view, the advantages of continued availability, wide acceptance and respect, an easily learned and comprehensive notation, excellently produced charts, convenient size, and (in the case of the Nickerson Color Fan ) a feasible price; its only real limitation for the description of bindings is the discrepancy in surface texture between the color chips and cloth. (2) The Ostwald System — The other most widely known system is the one developed by Wilhelm Ostwald, 1909 Nobel laureate in chemistry. His theories of color appeared in a long succession of works following Die Farbenfibel (1916) and were translated by J. Scott Taylor in 1931 as Colour Science . The Ostwald solid is a double cone with a vertical black-white axis; thus any hue plane, up to the axis, may be pictured as an equilateral triangle, with its three angles at the points of black, white, and the pure color. There are eight steps from white to black, lettered a , c , e , g , i , l , n , p ; from each of these points lines are drawn parallel to the other two sides of the triangle and each intersection is labeled by the letters of the two lines which meet there. Thus the points where the line from e meets the other two sides of the triangle would be ea and pe ; and the point of saturation would be pa . The equator of the double cone is divided into twenty-four hue steps, each assigned a number; in this way a color can be specified as 8pa or 10nc , and so on. The system is ingenious and has been widely used in solving problems of decoration and color harmony, but two defects are immediately apparent — one of theoretical, and the other of practical, importance. Because the point of highest saturation for any given hue falls at the apex of a triangle which contains the other shades and tints of that hue, no provision is made for the irregularities in the surface of the solid resulting from the divergences in saturation attainable by different coloring materials; so the system is inflexible, and the development of new methods for producing greater saturation in a given hue necessitates readjusting the entire triangle. On the practical level, the method of notation is much more difficult to learn and remember than the Munsell notation. Between 1932 and 1935 J. Scott Taylor arranged The Ostwald Colour Album , which contained twelve plates in a box and displayed about 1400 colors. But the most widely used collection of color chips based on the Ostwald system is the Container Corporation of America's Color Harmony Manual (1942; 2nd ed., 1946; 3rd ed., 1948) by Egbert Jacobson, Walter C. Granville, and Carl E. Foss. The latest edition contains 949 removable hexagonal chips (one side glossy and the other matte) on loose leaf charts in a zippered portfolio. These features make it extremely convenient, but its price of $150 militates against its choice by bibliographers. In 1950 Helen D. Taylor, Lucille Knoche, and Walter C. Granville published a Descriptive Color Names Dictionary as a supplement to the third edition of the Manual . The color names were selected after a survey of previous dictionaries and of the terms used commercially by various companies; by means of this dictionary the Ostwald symbols may be translated into verbal expressions — 10pl is "deep eggplant" and 16ne is "peacock blue." However, such terms are somewhat too fanciful to give a clear idea of the color to a reader of a descriptive bibliography who does not happen to have the Manual at hand. In short, the Color Harmony Manual is an admirably produced tool, but the Ostwald system on which it is based is not so suitable a standard for bibliography as is the Munsell system. (3) British Colour Council Dictionary of Colour Standards — The color standard officially adopted by the British Standards Institution (Standard 543-1934) is the Dictionary of Colour Standards (1934; 2nd ed., 1951) issued by the British Colour Council. The second edition displays 240 colors (twenty more than the first edition), produced on silk ribbons, each divided into smooth and ribbed surfaces and fastened as a loop so that the sample may be lifted enough to insert the item to be matched beneath. The Dictionary takes the form of two volumes in a portfolio: one volume (57 pp.) is a list of the colors, with their BCC numbers and the origin of the name; the other is a folding chart exhibiting the colored ribbons, each sample numbered consecutively and assigned a name and a code reference. The fact that the Dictionary is an officially adopted standard and the fact that it consists of cloth samples are enormous advantages, which no doubt lie behind John Carter's choice of this Dictionary for bibliographical purposes, but its nomenclature is not so appropriate as might be desired. In the first place, the identifying numbers (from BCC 1 to BCC 240), unlike the Munsell notation, give no indication of the position of the color in color space. On top of that, the names, however conventional some of them may be in certain fields, have often been chosen for industrial uses and are not always clear to the general reader — for instance, BCC 71 is "Garter Blue," BCC 235 "Crayon Blue," BCC 239 "Gloucestershire Green," BCC 142 "Corn Husk," and BCC 170 "Natal Brown." The colors have usually been matched to the object named, as the description of the origin of "Peacock Blue" (BCC 120) illustrates: "A very old colour name. The colour here given was matched to peacock feathers, and is a general representation of samples submitted by textile and other colour using industries." The arrangement of the samples is also less meaningful than might be hoped: thus "Brick Red" (BCC 125) and "Guardsman Red" (BCC 126) are separated by several leaves from the related "Signal Red," "Post Office Red," and "Union Jack Red" (BCC 208-210). Of the other publications of the British Colour Council, two should be mentioned. In 1938 the Council issued (in collaboration with the Royal Horticultural Society) the first volume of a Horticultural Colour Chart , also called the Wilson Colour Chart after Robert F. Wilson, the active and prominent general manager of the Council at that time. It consists of a portfolio containing 100 loose plates of printed color samples (not affixed chips). Each leaf lists foreign synonyms of the color name and the equivalents in four other systems (BCC Dictionary , Ridgway, Oberthür-Dauthenay, Ostwald); it also indicates a special notation for the color, in which the last two digits stand for one of 64 hues and the preceding digit represents lighter tints (600's and below) and darker shades (700's and above) — thus "Rose Bengal" is 25 and "Phlox Pink" is 625 — with prefixed zeros for steps of graying. In 1941 a second volume of 100 more plates was published. These two volumes, with their somewhat awkward notation and nomenclature and their rather inconvenient physical form, would not be successful for bibliographical description. The other publication is the one used by Stott in his Maugham bibliography, the Dictionary of Colours for Interior Decoration (1949), with 378 colors (labeled CC1-CC378) displayed in silk samples in three volumes. The Council's regular Dictionary of Colour Standards contains cross references to this chart, but the names do not always match — BCC47, "Victrix Blue," for example, is the same as CC287, "Ming Blue." This situation does not seem conducive to standardization of terminology, particularly when the terms are not self-explanatory. Stott, after using this Dictionary , reported that "many book cloths defy even the 378 examples shown on the chart" (p. 8); and a reviewer of his bibliography questioned the BCC nomenclature by asking whether the gain in accuracy was "worth achieving at the cost of superficial confusion in the minds of those who are more familiar with The Library than with Vogue ." 22 Another disadvantage of all three publications was expressed by Cahill when asked why he adopted a paint standard instead of the British Colour Council's Dictionary : "its bulk and price make it an impossible tool for the Belloc collectors, enthusiasts and booksellers for whom my book is mainly intended." 23 The bibliographer should be aware of the features of certain other systems, though none of them would serve as a practical choice for a bibliographical standard: (1) the Standard Color Card of America (9th ed., 1941), with 216 silk swatches, used mainly by the textile industry, employs rather bizarre nomenclature and is an unsystematic sampling of color space; (2) the DIN-Farbenkarte (1953), with samples representing equal psychological steps, is the official German standard, not very widely known in England and America; (3) the great Villalobos Colour Atlas (1947), probably the most extensive guide available, shows 7279 samples, each with a hole in the center to facilitate matching; (4) the Dictionary of Color (1930; 2nd ed., 1950) by Aloys J. Maerz and M. Rea Paul is the standard work on color nomenclature, with 7056 colors on 56 plates, and it is no criticism of the work's great authority to say that the small size of the color squares (usually 144 to the page, with no holes for comparison) and the historical purpose of the work (with some colors assigned no name at all) make it inappropriate as a standard for bibliography; (5) the Plochere Color System (1948) by Gladys and Gustave Plochere, with 1248 colors on 3" x 5" cards (or smaller mounted rectangles), is basically a guide for interior decorators; (6) Federal Standard No. 595 (1956), with 358 color chips, is not a systematic sampling and is mainly intended for the specification of paint colors in use by the United States government; (7) Robert Ridgway's Color Standards and Color Nomenclature (1912), with 1115 colors and names, was long a standard for naturalists but is now out of print; (8) the Nu-Hue Color Coordinator (1949, 1952), prepared by Carl E. Foss for the Martin-Senour Company, is perhaps the most ambitious and elaborately produced of the colorant-mixture systems developed by paint manufacturers; (9) the 1962 Reinhold Color Atlas (in England the Methuen Handbook of Colour ), by A. Kornerup and J.H.Wanscher, displays 1266 colors in extremely (perhaps overly) compact form. These systems are of course only a few out of a possible list of seventy-five or more; but the bibliographer cannot seriously consider the great majority of color charts, devised specifically for stamp collectors, horticulturists, interior decorators, paint dealers, textile dyers, or ornithologists. Clearly the various attempts at color standardization have not in the past led to any general system which encompasses or coordinates a large number of them, and the bibliographer is faced with a multiplicity of systems, none of which precisely suits his needs. The choice of one with the fewest disadvantages becomes a matter of deciding which of the desired features are most important — whether it is better to have a standard with a large number of colors, or a satisfactory nomenclature, or a low price, or something else. There is no doubt that the problem of nomenclature is extremely important for bibliographical description, because the reader of a bibliography should not be required to consult a color chart except when a question arises. He should not be confronted with "8pa" or "13432," unaccompanied by a commonly understood color expression; yet the common expression must be firmly attached to a precise area in color space so that it will hold the same meaning for each user. Fortunately, such a system is now available.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II In 1931 the Inter-Society Color Council was formed as an organization of national societies whose work involved color; it was not only to be a clearinghouse for color problems and research but more specifically was to assist in revising the color names used in the U. S. Pharmacopoeia. 24 E. N. Gathercoal, the ISCC's first chairman, was a member of the Pharmacopoeial Revision Committee, and he had arranged a symposium on color names at the 1930 Pharmacopoeial Convention in Washington. His goal was a color nomenclature "sufficiently standardized as to be acceptable to science, sufficiently broad to be appreciated and usable by science, art, and industry, and sufficiently commonplace to be understood, at least in a general way, by the whole public." By 1933 I. H. Godlove had sketched out the foundation for such a system; by 1936 Kenneth L. Kelly of the National Bureau of Standards was working on the task of assigning boundaries to the suggested color designations; and in 1939 Deane B. Judd and Kelly published Research Paper 1239, "Method of Designating Colors," in which common color names were defined in terms of specific areas of the Munsell color solid. 25 This ISCC-NBS method, as it was called, was an enormous step forward, but by 1949 a committee of the ISCC had revised the color boundaries in response to certain criticisms which some users had made. Finally, in 1955, Kelly and Judd published the revised version of their 1939 work, which now also contained a dictionary relating the ISCC-NBS names to those in other systems. This remarkable book, The ISCC-NBS Method of Designating Colors and a Dictionary of Color Names , is NBS Circular 553, available from the Superintendent of Documents, U. S. Government Printing Office, at $2, and should certainly be a part of every bibliographer's equipment. In the history of color nomenclature, the work is epoch-making in at least two ways. First, instead of assigning names to particular color chips, it proceeds in the other direction, setting up a system of easily understood names and then mapping out the entire color solid for the first time into segments which define the precise limits of each name. The system of names — which takes into account the three attributes of color — is a simple one based on ten hue names, three neutrals, their modifying forms, and ten other modifiers, as follows: Hues B blue Br brown G green O orange Ol olive P purple Pk pink R red V violet Y yellow b bluish br brownish g greenish p purplish pk pinkish r reddish y yellowish Neutrals Black black Gy gray White white blackish blackish gy. grayish Value Modifiers ( Lightness ) d. dark l. light med. medium v. very Chroma Modifiers ( Saturation ) gy. grayish m. moderate s. strong v. vivid Value and Chroma Combinations brill. brilliant [light, strong] deep deep [dark, strong] p. pale [light, grayish] The abbreviations provide a concise notation (as "v.d.pR" for "very dark purplish red") but of course are not essential. The point is that there are no "post office reds," nor "puces," nor even "garnets" here, but only combinations which — however complicated, as "dark grayish olive green" — at least give a suggestion of the particular color to any reader. The color solid is then divided into 267 named segments, and the boundaries of each are plotted on 31 charts representing ranges of Munsell hue. Thus, for example, both Munsell renotation 4R 3/6 and 3R 2.5/5 fall within the area designated as "dark red." Since colorimetric measurements have been made of the colors of Munsell renotation, 26 even a color identified in CIE terms could be converted to an ISCC-NBS name. The second important feature of the work — the second part, added in 1955 — is the dictionary, which makes it equally easy to convert to these names from a number of systems other than Munsell. This dictionary is a compilation of the names used in fourteen previous charts or atlases: Maerz-Paul, Plochere, Ridgway, Federal Specification TT-C-595, Wilson's Horticultural Colour Chart , the Color Card of America , Taylor-Knoche-Granville (supplement to the Color Harmony Manual ), the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists and the Society of Dyers and Colourists' standard, Commercial Standards CS147-47 (Urea Plastics) and CS156-49 (Polystyrene Plastics), the National Research Council's Rock-Color Chart , the Department of Agriculture's Soil Color Chart , H. A. Dade's Color Terminology in Biology , and W. H. Beck's Postage-Stamp Color Names . First comes a list (pp. 35-82) of the 267 ISCC-NBS names with the synonyms from these systems listed under each name. Then follows the dictionary proper (pp. 83-158), which lists alphabetically all the names from these fourteen systems (about 7500 names), giving for each the source and the ISCC-NBS designation (and serial number). Previous dictionaries drawing names together from various sources have not subordinated them to a new terminology nor attempted to provide names to cover the entire color solid systematically; the ISCC-NBS method is thus a kind of master-system, furnishing a common ground to coordinate earlier systems. If one person, using Maerz-Paul, describes a color as "Rhodonite Pink" and another, using Plochere, refers to "Orchid Mauve," both can consult the ISCC-NBS dictionary and discover that they are dealing with the same color, "dark purplish pink" (no. 251). The advantages of this system for bibliographers (or for anyone else) are immediately apparent. It provides a consistent, standard, easily understood nomenclature for color, regardless of the particular set of color chips employed for matching. If one bibliographer prefers for some reason to use the Plochere system but hesitates to describe the color of a certain binding cloth as "Best Effort" (or as 1224 YYg 3-h), he can look that name up in the ISCC-NBS dictionary and find that it corresponds to ISCC-NBS 121, "pale yellow green." Then if another bibliographer, who wishes to check this color himself, has only a copy of Ridgway at hand, he may make the comparison, find that Ridgway's "Glaucous" is the one that matches, and check the dictionary to see that "Glaucous" is also within the area defined by "pale yellow green." The same would be true of a third bibliographer or collector who had identified the binding as "Rhone" (Maerz-Paul 18 B 3). In this way uniformity results in the final bibliographical description, despite the multiplicity of systems which may have been used by individual bibliographers. Even if a bibliographer buys for himself a copy of the Munsell Book of Color , for example, he may not always have it with him; if he finds himself in a library which has only a copy of Maerz-Paul, he may proceed with his description of the binding and later convert the Maerz-Paul term by using the ISCC-NBS dictionary. For accuracy and for general scholarly indication of sources, the ISCC-NBS name should be accompanied by a reference in parentheses to the actual color sample used — as "dark red (Maerz-Paul 6 L 11)," or "dark red (Plochere 353 R 3-a)," or "dark red (TCCA 65020)," or "dark red (Munsell 2.5R 3/7)." The Nickerson Color Fan is particularly convenient (aside from its price, size, and arrangement) because it designates on each sample both the Munsell notation and the ISCC-NBS name (thus obviating any reference to the dictionary itself after the process of matching). In any case, two points are essential: that bibliographers agree to compare binding colors with some collection of color samples and that they convert the identifications into ISCC-NBS names. 27 The only real limitation of the ISCC-NBS system as published in 1955 was that it contained no actual color chips to illustrate the names. However, by 1958 Kenneth L. Kelly had worked out the Munsell renotations for the center of gravity of each of the 267 ISCC-NBS color-name blocks, 28 and handmade charts illustrating these centroid colors were produced as an aid to ISCC-NBS Subcommittee on Problem 23, the Historical Expression of Color Usage, as explained in its Interim Report of 20 November 1960. The NBS then began preparing such charts for general distribution as a supplement to Circular 553, and they became available in February 1965 from the Standard Reference Materials Office at the National Bureau of Standards, as Standard Sample No. 2106, for $3 per set. 29 The ISCC-NBS Centroid Color Charts complete the system, and for a total of $5 the bibliographer can now equip himself with both the dictionary and the charts, which together comprise the most efficient method of color naming yet devised and the one most likely to become a general standard accepted by all fields. The charts alone are all that the bibliographer need carry with him, and they are convenient in size. There are twenty leaves, 10½" x 8", of which the first two contain a table giving the Munsell renotation for each centroid sample and the other eighteen are hue charts illustrating 251 of the 267 ISCC-NBS names in glossy chips 1" square. The chips are arranged on each sheet as they would appear on a Munsell hue plane (that is, with the grays at the left, the highly saturated colors at the right, the lighter colors at the top, and the darker ones at the bottom), against a neutral background of about their own value level; beneath each chip is the identifying number of that color-name block and the abbreviation of its color name. Using these charts the bibliographer will not have to make any conversions from one color name to another; he can simply find the chip which most nearly matches his binding and record it as "deep bluish green (Centroid 161)" or "vivid orange (Centroid 48)" or "dark grayish yellowish brown (Centroid 81)." The first question which bibliographers are likely to raise is whether a system with 267 colors (and 251 chips) can be sufficiently accurate, particularly in view of Stott's comment, in his Maugham bibliography, that the 378 samples in the BCC's Dictionary of Colours for Interior Decoration were not sufficient. The question may be answered in two ways. First, one must consider the principle of selection of the 267 colors. Though not a great number, they represent blocks which, taken together, comprise the entire color solid; the chips, in turn, represent the center of 251 of these blocks. In contrast to other systems, then, each chip illustrates a color characteristic of a well-defined area. When one decides that a particular binding color does not match precisely any of the centroid chips but comes closest to matching Centroid 16, one can be sure that the block of the solid labeled "dark red" contains the particular color, and "dark red" is thus an accurate term, even though the match with the color chip was not exact. To this degree, the system is capable of complete accuracy, whereas in other systems the fact that one chip is closer than another to the color in question has little significance for naming, since the boundaries of the color-name have not been defined. Second, since the ISCC-NBS dictionary encompasses fourteen other systems (plus the Munsell name charts), it is always possible, when finer discriminations are required, to utilize a system with more chips and yet remain within the framework of the ISCC-NBS method. Indeed, Kelly has explained six levels of accuracy in color description attainable within this method. 30 In the first the color solid is divided into only 13 sections, corresponding to the ten hue names and the three neutrals; for some purposes it is enough to distinguish "pink" from "red," or "yellow" from "orange." The second level works with 29 name-blocks, consisting of all the hue terms — such as "olive brown," "greenish yellow," "yellowish brown," or "olive green." The 267 names produced by adding the modifiers descriptive of value and chroma, as in the ISCC-NBS dictionary and centroid charts, constitute the third level of refinement, the one on which bibliographers may normally find themselves. But many distinguishable colors naturally fall within each of these name-blocks, and it may be that certain binding variants are not distinguishable in terms of the centroid colors alone. One may then move to the fourth level, which involves consulting an appropriate color-order system — Munsell if possible, but, if not, perhaps Plochere, with 1248 colors, or Maerz-Paul, with 7056. 31 If an exact match is not found, the next step (the fifth level) is to make a visual interpolation from the Munsell Book of Color . Because the Munsell system is based on psychological spacing (a color-appearance system) and because the Munsell notation is conveniently manipulated to reflect changes in any of the three attributes, a person with some experience can accurately indicate about 100,000 colors by such interpolation. The sixth and highest level of accuracy is of course the CIE method of spectrophotometric measurement, capable of dividing the color solid into about five million parts. Bibliographers will need to leave the third level only rarely, but the accuracy required at certain times 32 may necessitate moving to the fourth or fifth levels. In any event, the ISCC-NBS system adequately takes into account the fact that varying degrees of accuracy are desirable under varying circumstances. Another problem arises from the fact that the centroid color chips are glossy and book cloth is not. Since the ideal system for bibliography is undoubtedly one with cloth samples, there is no answer to this objection, except to say that the system offers so many other advantages that it is still the best one to choose. Besides, the importance of the surface texture of the sample in any given case is a function of the accuracy required. In some instances, then, the bibliographer may wish to turn to the textile Color Card — so long as he realizes that its sampling of the color solid is not systematic — or to the British Colour Council's Dictionary . The difference in appearance between a glossy chip and a cloth swatch of the same color is also to some degree a function of the viewing conditions. It is normally recommended, in most systems of color identification, that the matching be done in natural light, preferably northern light and certainly not direct sunlight; the light should strike the surfaces to be matched at an angle of 45°, and the surfaces should be viewed from 90°. Some sets of chips include masks which can be used to block out the colors on the chart surrounding the chip being matched. Although the ISCC-NBS charts do not contain masks, it is a good idea to prepare a few of them by making a hole 1" square in a stiff piece of gray paper or cardboard. Still another of the bibliographer's questions will concern notation — what form the color information is to take in a bibliographical description. The ISCC-NBS abbreviations — as "d.gy.G" — should probably not be used, for they give essentially common terms an esoteric appearance; "dark grayish green" does not take up too much space. The centroid number can conveniently be inserted in parentheses following the name, just as the letter identifying a cloth grain can be placed after the verbal description of it. Thus what formerly might have been referred to as "dark green ribbed cloth" may now appear as follows: dark grayish green (Centroid 151) bold-ribbed (T) cloth or bold-ribbed (T) cloth, dark grayish green (Centroid 151) The length of the color expression, including its parenthesis, may be clearer and less awkward if it follows, rather than precedes, the designation of grain. A further convention may perhaps be agreed upon: the presence of a centroid number suggests only that the color falls within that color-name block and does not necessarily imply an exact match with the centroid color; however, if another set of chips is referred to as the standard for the identification, the match may be inferred as exact, unless the abbreviation "cf." precedes the notation. To illustrate: dark grayish green (Centroid 151) [indicates the color-name block] dark grayish green (Nickerson 10 GY 3/2) [indicates precise match] dark grayish green (cf. Nickerson 10 GY 3/2) [indicates approximate match] Obviously the last of these represents an extension of the fourth level of accuracy; it stops short of the fifth level because an interpolation has not been suggested. When an interpolation is made, the notation should be enclosed in brackets: dark grayish green [Munsell 10 GY 3.2/1.75] In this system the color of Waldo Frank's Time Exposures (Boni &amp; Liveright, 1926) is "brilliant yellow (Centroid 83)," of Vachel Lindsay's Adventures While Preaching the Gospel of Beauty (Kennerley, 1914) "very deep red (Centroid 14)," of Sherwood Anderson's Horses and Men (Huebsch, 1923) "strong reddish orange (Centroid 35)"; and a complete description — of Eunice Tietjens' Jake (Boni &amp; Liveright, 1921) — would go something like this: Binding : linen (B) cloth, strong red (cf. Nickerson 5R 4/12); blocked in brilliant orange yellow (Centroid 67). Front: 'JAKE | [design] | BY EUNICE | TIETJENS'. Spine: '[thick-thin rule] | JAKE | [design] | EUNICE | TIETJENS | BONI AND | LIVERIGHT | [thin-thick rule]'. Back: blank. Stiff wove endpapers, strong red (cf. Nickerson 2.5R 5/12). All edges trimmed; top edge stained as endpapers. In this instance the slight difference in color between the cloth and the endpapers could not be indicated by reference to Centroid 12, so approximations to two colors in the Nickerson Color Fan were used. However, it should be emphasized here that, despite an occasional example of this kind, the bibliographer generally need feel no urge to go beyond the centroid charts. Given the nature of book cloth and of material standards, the majority of matches are going to be only approximate; and in any case the purposes of most bibliographical descriptions would not be further served by a more precise match. For these reasons the centroid colors, which are simply the representative colors of particular color-blocks, constitute an ideal frame of reference. If a bibliographer goes outside this system, one must assume either (1) that another system was the only one at hand when the comparison was made (with the result later converted to the corresponding centroid name) or (2) that greater accuracy was required — and obtained — by specification in terms of another system. It would be a mistake to overuse the "cf." designation, for, if the match is only approximate anyway, nothing is gained in precision over the simple reference to the centroid color. Because of the advantages of the Munsell notation, it may be that some bibliographers, if they have had to turn to another set of chips for an exact match, will want to indicate the equivalent Munsell notation or renotation as a convenience to their readers. The Munsell equivalents of the most commonly used systems have been tabulated, and it may prove helpful to bring together the principal references to these conversion tables: Color Harmony Manual Walter C.

Whether the original match was exact or approximate, an equals sign may be used to indicate the Munsell equivalent; but if one wishes to give only the centroid number, the symbol for "approximately equals" (≈) should be used: grayish purplish red ( Standard Color Card 70189 = Munsell 6RP 5.1/5.7) grayish purplish red (cf. Standard Color Card 70189 = Munsell 6RP 5.1/5.7) grayish purplish red ( Standard Color Card 70189 ≈ Centroid 262) grayish purplish red (cf. Standard Color Card 70189 ≈ Centroid 262) If Munsell renotation is employed, it should be so specified: grayish purplish red ( Standard Color Card 70189 = Munsell renotation 5.5RP 5.2/5.9) The Munsell renotations of the centroid colors are provided in the table accompanying the centroid charts; if a binding happens by chance to match exactly a centroid chip, the coincidence may be indicated by including the renotation figure: grayish purplish red (Centroid 262 = Munsell renotation 7RP 4.5/5.1) These equivalences are of course simply additional information which may be furnished for the convenience of the reader in making his own further comparisons; they are by no means required. But knowledge of the existence of these conversion tables may be useful to the reader of a bibliography which does not provide the equivalences. Another question — and one of the most troublesome — is the problem of fading, both of the color samples and of the bindings. As far as the samples are concerned, one should not expose them to light except when they are being used; and after extended use one should perhaps compare them with a new copy to see whether they have yet faded. A consideration of faded bindings is tied up with the whole matter of the degree of accuracy required, for in some cases it may be necessary to determine whether a given binding is variant or merely faded. But in most instances the determination of a secondary binding will not turn solely on color discrimination, and, since a bibliographical description records the characteristics of an "ideal copy," 34 the general rule is to include in the binding description a notation of the brightest copy examined. Then, if one wishes to provide the colormatching data for the other copies, the paragraph listing "Copies Examined" is the proper place for the information. In the case of certain scarce books, all copies may appear faded, even on the covers (as well as the spine, where fading is to be expected). If there is no small patch or strip of brighter color (as on the inside edge of a cover) to serve as a basis for the color identification, one may have to describe the color as it appears and append a note explaining one's hunch that the color is probably faded. A descriptive catalogue of the books in a particular collection, however, is obligated to describe a binding in whatever faded state it is found in that collection; but an energetic cataloguer will go further (by examining other copies or consulting a published bibliography) and indicate the extent of the fading, either through an exact match or through interpolation. moderate red (Centroid 15), faded from strong red (Centroid 12) moderate red (Munsell renotation [3.8R 3.9/8.75], faded from 3.8R 4.4/9.1 = Centroid 15) moderate red (Munsell renotation 3.8R 4.4/9.1 = Centroid 15, faded from [3.8R 4.4/9.75]) Dorothy Nickerson has worked out a formula for an Index of Fading, whereby the amount of fading can be indicated in a single figure. Though the formula is not a complicated one, the single-figure index is more meaningful for expressing tolerances in the textile industry than for describing the fading of bindings, since the single figure (consolidating the differences in hue, value, and chroma) does not enable one to visualize the changes in the three attributes. A final consideration has to do with the fact that colors in books are not limited to bindings. There are colored sheets, inks, dust jackets, and endpapers; and the ISCC-NBS names are appropriate for describing them all. In fact, Deane Judd has specifically commented on the applicability of these names for the paper industry and has shown some of the equivalents between the ISCC-NBS names and those in the Grading Committee of the Groundwood Paper Manufacturers' Association's "Blue Book," Standard Color Nomenclature System and Manual (1936). 35 The methods developed for measuring the whiteness of paper, however useful for specification and standardization in the paper industry, go beyond the degree of accuracy required in the bibliographical description of white papers. Colors of printing inks may also be specified in ISCC-NBS terms; in 1935 the International Printing Ink Corporation issued A Series of Monographs on Color , which included a description of the advantages of the Munsell system. But the many atlases and sets of color chips circulated by both paper and ink companies are not convenient as general standards. Not a great deal of attention has been given to the description of dust jackets, 36 but the main problem is simply a question of the completeness of the description rather than of method; and the ISCC-NBS names should make such descriptions more accurate. Another kind of paper, however, causes greater trouble — the marbled papers sometimes used as endpapers or binding papers. The difficulty in describing them is analogous to that in specifying cloth grains and is not essentially a color problem. It would be very helpful, therefore, to have a chart illustrating such marbling patterns as "gold vein" or "nonpareil" — the same sort of chart (but on a more elaborate scale) that Bernard C. Middleton furnishes as the frontispiece to his A History of English Craft Bookbinding Technique (1963), where twelve common kinds of decorated papers are displayed. 37 In 1953 Fredson Bowers remarked, "As a matter of fact, when the technicians really get to work on the problems of machine-printing, I rather suspect that the general reader and the bibliographer who has catered to him are due to suffer a shock." 38 Whether or not the method of color description outlined here will offer a shock to those bibliographers who fondly remember the good old days when it was possible to speak of "puce" or "Eureka" or "Victoria Lake," depending on one's mood, the fact remains that a move in this direction is inevitable. The ISCC-NBS system can be as simple or as complex as is required under different circumstances, and its use is no more difficult, and only slightly more time-consuming, than the measurement of leaves with a ruler. The color names should shock no one, and the whole method seems ideally suited to descriptive bibliography — with the exception of the glossy chips. Perhaps a handbook can some day be produced which will contain illustrations and names of binding grains and decorative papers along with the centroid colors in cloth samples. In the meantime it is not asking too much that bibliographers compare each binding cloth with the centroid chips or some other collection of samples and express the color name in ISCC-NBS terms. Maerz and Paul, at the beginning of their Dictionary of Color , observe that, "while standardization has been arrived at in practically all other fields, in the use of color names for identifying color sensations a condition prevails that is usually characterized as chaotic." Bibliographers can ill afford to perpetuate chaos in any of their endeavors, if their general concern with order and accuracy is to be meaningful. 39 A Note on the Literature The bibliographer who wishes to pursue further the problems of color specification and nomenclature and is generally unacquainted with the technical literature of the field discovers few places to turn for help except several alphabetical checklists in the basic books on color and I.H.Godlove's Bibliography on Color (Inter-Society Color Council, 1957). The present list groups the significant literature by topic or system, with the interests of the bibliographer in mind, and is intended also to record the material which served as the basis for the somewhat perfunctory dismissal of a large number of color systems in the text. The principal general surveys of color systems, which vary in the number of systems covered and in the thoroughness of their comment, are as follows: Ralph M.

Cleland published "A Practical Description of the Munsell Color System" (pp. 13-26). Another early discussion is Irwin G. Priest, K. S. Gibson, and H. J. McNichols, An Examination of the Munsell Color System (Technologic Papers of the Bureau of Standards, No. 167, 30 September 1920). Norman Macbeth, in "Munsell Value Scales for Judging Reflectance," Illuminating Engineering , XLIV (1949), 106-108, discusses one of the special Munsell charts.

In 1943 some of the original specifications in the Munsell Book of Color were modified in terms of the CIE coordinate system and standard observer, and the results are referred to as the "Munsell renotation system" (as opposed to "book notation"): see Sidney M.

The basis for a set of chips, systematically sampling the color solid and truly representing equal perceptual differences, is set forth by Günter Wyszecki, "A Regular Rhombohedral Lattice Sampling of Munsell Renotation Space," JOSA , XLIV (1954), 725-734; the Committee on Uniform Color Scales of the Optical Society of America is working on the preparation of such a system.

Foss, Dorothy Nickerson, and Walter C. Granville, "Analysis of the Ostwald Color System," JOSA , XXXIV (1944), 361-381; Egbert Jacobson, Basic Color : An Interpretation of the Ostwald Color System (1948). For a comparison of the merits of the two systems, see Milton E. Bond and Dorothy Nickerson, "Color-Order Systems, Munsell and Ostwald," JOSA , XXXII (1942), 709-719. The Ostwald system has had a number of enthusiastic supporters who have developed their own applications of it, notably Faber Birren in his many books. In Color Dimensions (1934), after praising Ostwald as the "greatest scientist ever to devote a large portion of time and energy to color harmony" (p. 35) and after pointing out that "the vast majority of systems so far invented are utterly spurious and impractical" (p. 4), Birren presents his own version of Ostwald, the Color Equation (based on the spinning of Maxwell disks — cf. footnote 15 above), and declares that with it "the problem of color standardization — so long a complex affair — has been adequately solved" (p. 57). Hilaire Hiler, in Color Harmony and Pigments (1942), expresses his admiration of Ostwald before explaining his own Color Circle, Color Piano, and cylindrical Color Solid; J. A. V. Judson bases his textbook, A Handbook of Colour (1935; rev. ed., 1938), on Ostwald; The Color Helm (1932, 1940), designed by J. P. Gangler for Fiatelle, Inc., uses the Ostwald system; and The New Color Culler (1951, 1960) of the Desarco Corporation contains eleven Ostwald triangles. BRITISH COLOUR COUNCIL. See Robert F.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Occasionally a bibliographer describing pre-nineteenth-century books will include information on bindings, especially if he is describing the particular copies in a given collection; see, for example, Allan Stevenson's discussion in his introduction to the eighteenth-century volume of the Hunt Botanical Catalogue , II (1961), clxxxiii-clxxxvi. 2 Cf. Fredson Bowers, "Purposes of Descriptive Bibliography, with Some Remarks on Methods," Library , 5th ser., VIII (1953), 4. Bowers further points out that identifying binding states may aid in detecting concealed impressions. His general discussion of the description of publishers' cloth is in Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), pp. 446-450. 3 In some cases, if the finish is no longer being produced, "arbitrary symbols" have been assigned (I, xxxi). All the symbols are of course arbitrary, but some of the combinations are meaningful, given the original symbol: thus HT combines the characteristics of H ("diaper") and T ("ribbed"). 4 This double system of nomenclature, combining a readily understood term with a more precise technical one, is parallel to the method recommended later in this article for the designation of color. 5 Jacob Blanck, in "A Calendar of Bibliographical Difficulties," PBSA , XLIX (1955), 1-18, reported that he had considered, for use in the BAL descriptions, both Robert Ridgway's color chart and the spectrophotometer, but he rejected both and in the end had his own eyes examined (pp. 4-6). 6 Leon Edel and Dan H. Laurence, A Bibliography of Henry James (1958; rev. 1961), pp. 18-19. 7 Another bibliography which uses a comparative method for gaining greater precision in its careful attention to color is R. L. Purdy's of Hardy (1954): after The Return of the Native is described as "brown," the secondary binding can be called "a slightly redder shade of brown" (p. 24). 8 Library , 5th ser., XVIII (1963), 243-245. Rota also refers to the Cahill and Stott bibliographies and remarks that B. J. Kirkpatrick's bibliography of Virginia Woolf (1957) employs terms for nine shades of green, without referring the reader to any chart or standard. 9 Cf. Carter, Binding Variants in English Publishing , p. 82. 10 TLS , 23 January 1953, p. 64. 11 A sketch of the history of color systems can be found, among other places, in Faber Birren, Color Dimensions (1934), pp. 4-9, and Aloys Maerz and M. Rea Paul, Dictionary of Color (2nd ed., 1950), pp. 137-144. 12 Also referred to as the ICI (International Commission on Illumination). 13 This system is discussed in all basic books on color and in many articles in the Journal of the Optical Society of America ( JOSA ). References to such discussions, both for the CIE system and for the other systems referred to below, will be found in the appended "Note on the Literature." 14 Of course, one might argue that if two bindings do in fact vary, even if they came from bolts which the manufacturer or the binder considered identical, the variations should be recorded, whether or not any question of priority is involved. And if the notion of a descriptive bibliographer's duties is extended to its ultimate limits, the argument cannot be denied. However, in practical terms it is impossible for a bibliographer to record every physical (and chemical) fact about a book; those facts must therefore be selected which have some meaning or usefulness to the persons for whom the information is being assembled. In the case of binding color, even if it were possible to determine that certain copies of a given impression of a book were bound earlier than other copies from the same bolt of material, the fact would be of no significance to the bibliographer — or the sane book-collector. On the other hand, if a slight variation in binding furnishes a clue to an interruption in the binding process that produced two binding "issues" (which may or may not coincide with two states or issues of the sheets), the fact may turn out to have bibliographical significance. The bibliographer will have to explore each case on an individual basis to determine his own tolerance limits — to determine, that is, the degree of precision beyond which he need not go in order to make meaningful discriminations. 15 Cf. W. D. Wright, The Measurement of Colour (3rd ed., 1964), p. 161, in which he describes how the CIE system "can, and should, be related to subjective descriptions of colour." An early statement of the ratio method is Lewis F. Richardson, "Quantitative Mental Estimates of Light and Colour," British Journal of Psychology , XX (1929), 27-37; see also Tentative Recommended Practice for Visual Evaluation of Color Differences of Opaque Materials (American Society for Testing and Materials, Method D1729-60T, 1960). Another approach, developed in the nineteenth century by James Clerk Maxwell, is to take a few basic material standards in the form of disks and spin them in various combinations until a match is attained; the proportions may be expressed in CIE terms, as Dorothy Nickerson explains in "Disk Colorimetry," JOSA , XXV (1935), 253-257. A disk-spinning motor and other equipment for disk colorimetry are available from the Munsell Color Company; but the process is too cumbersome and time-consuming to be appropriate for bibliographical purposes. 16 See Donald R. Dohner and Carl E. Foss, "Color-Mixing Systems: Color vs. Colorant Mixture," JOSA , XXXII (1942), 702-708; Carl E. Foss, "Color-Order Systems," Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers , LII (1949), 184-196; and Deane B. Judd and Günter Wyszecki, Color in Business , Science , and Industry (2nd ed., 1963), pp. 202ff. 17 Adrian Bernard Klein, in "The Munsell Colour System and the Need for a Standardisation of Colours," Penrose's Annual , XXIX (1927), 57-63, makes the point that no system which requires spectrophotometric equipment can be commonly accepted: "A yard-stick is not a fine micrometer, but it serves the practical purpose of measuring a piece of cloth accurately enough for ordinary use" (p. 59). 18 The solid would be irregularly shaped because the point of saturation for certain coloring materials at certain value levels is farther from the axis than for other materials. At the same time, the problem of the spacing of material standards is further complicated by the fact that equal perceptual differences in color do not correspond to equal distances in Euclidian space. 19 A booklet describing all the materials available may be obtained from the Munsell Color Company, 2441 North Calvert Street, Baltimore 21218. 20 This foundation, in the words of the Company's literature, exists to "further the scientific and practical advancement of color knowledge, and in particular, knowledge relating to standardization, nomenclature and specification of color; and to promote the practical application of these results to color problems arising in science, art and industry." 21 See Dorothy Nickerson, "Modern Color Science Is the Background for a New and Useful Color Chart for Horticulture," Proceedings of the Eleventh Annual American Horticultural Congress (October 1956), pp. 3-11.

See the "Note on the Literature" below. 27 Of course, only the first is truly essential; for if a color is specified in terms of any published color sample, one can always refer to the sample when it becomes necessary to see precisely what color the bibliographer had in mind. The conversion to ISCC-NBS names is, from this point of view, merely a convenience to readers; but that convenience is of great importance, for a really meaningful and efficient standardization of color names cannot be achieved until all bibliographers use the same name for the same color. 28 Kelly, "Central Notations for the Revised ISCC-NBS Color-Name Blocks," Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards , LXI (1958), 427-431.

      <field name="heading_text">The Influence of Justification on Spelling in Jaggard's Compositor B by William S. Kable</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is a bibliographical axiom that variant spellings were an important method used by early compositors to justify the lines of type which they set. McKerrow, after discussing the use of variant spellings for justification, adds a note: "It is not possible to say exactly to what extent the printers relied on variations in spelling as a means of justification; it seems, however, not unlikely that it was their chief expedient." 1 In Moxon's discussion of the compositor's trade, however, and more specifically in his remarks on composing and correcting the type, he makes no mention of variant spellings but confines his dicta to the use of spaces. 2 Perhaps the pressures toward uniform spelling were too strong by the time Moxon wrote his Mechanick Exercises in the 1680's to allow the use of variant spellings for justification. Charlton Hinman's study of the printing of the First Folio Shakespeare has indicated, on the other hand, that during the setting of the Folio in the early 1620's, the justification of long lines did in fact affect the compositors' spelling habits for do , go , and here . 3 A comprehensive spelling analysis of the Pavier quartos has produced a significant body of evidence which casts light on the remarkable influence of justification on compositorial spellings. 4 The spellings of the Pavier texts, ten Shakespearean and pseudo-Shakespearean reprints done in 1619 from extant, identifiable editions dating from 1594 to 1611, reflect the spelling pattern of Jaggard's Compositor B. It has been known for some time that Jaggard's house produced the Paviers, and a part of the present writer's study has been devoted to demonstrating that Compositor B did in fact set the type throughout the Paviers. A large body of statistical information is now at hand to reveal the profound effect of the need for justification on the use of variant spellings by Jaggard's Compositor B. B is seen to display a consistently strong preference for the final - y form of all words which can vary between final - ie and - y . Words ending in penultimate - f - and - s - are governed by a separate preference for - ie endings. Six words selected from this group show the influence of justification on B's preferences. There are seven (+J2) authoritie spellings in the copy used for the Paviers. 5 B changes all seven (+J1) of these spellings to final - y but allows the non-preferential form to stand once in a justified line. Every provides evidence of B's not merely accepting a non-preferential form from copy in a justified line but introducing a non-preferential form against the favored form which stands in copy. All five (+J2) everie spellings in copy are changed by B to every . He carefully retains eight (+J3) every spellings found in copy. The one apparently aberrant change of setting everie in place of copy's every occurs in a justified line. B's preference for history is shown by the fact that six (+J1) historie , one justified historye , and two history forms in copy are all set as history in his texts. Only two - ie forms can be seen in B's texts, and both occur in justified lines. B sets all of the twenty-eight ladie forms found in copy as lady and retains fifteen (+J1) lady forms found in copy. There is one aberrant change from lady to ladie , and the unusual form ladye is introduced by B in place of his preferred lady spelling in a justified line. B consolidates five (+J2) mery , one merie , five (+J1) merrie and ten merry forms found in copy all under his preferred spelling merry . One merry appeared in copy as mer -| ry divided between two lines. B employs the non-preferential form merie as a part of his means of justifying the line and avoiding the breaking of the word between two lines. Various copy spellings of pretty : prettie , twelve (+J3); pretie , three; prety , one; and pretty , three, are all consolidated by B to his preferential form pretty . The only other form set by B is a single example of prettie which is carried over from copy in a justified line. Almost all of the exceptions to B's pattern of setting final - y (except after - f - and - s -) occur, therefore, in justified lines. B is seen to be prone to accept non-preferential forms in justified lines and also to introduce non-preferential forms in place of preferential copy spellings for the purpose of justification. Another clearly defined spelling pattern is B's preference for final - e after penultimate - k -. Again, almost all of the exceptions to this rule occur in justified lines. There are three unjustified and two justified black spellings in copy. B changes all three unjustified forms to blacke but follows the two non-preferential forms which occurred in justified lines. Of the four (+J1) cheeke forms in copy which agree with B's preference, he sets the one justified spelling as cheek against his habit. Only one of the one unjustified and two justified drink spellings in copy is retained by B. That one is in a justified line. There are thirty-three unjustified and one justified speake spellings in copy. B retains all thirty-three unjustified preferential speake forms but sets speak for speake in a justified line. He changes the one unjustified speak in copy to speake but follows the non-preferential form the one time it occurs in a justified line. Of the eleven (+J12) talke spellings in copy, B sets all eleven unjustified and one justified talke . Eleven of the justified talke spellings are changed by B to talk against his preference. In case after case, B uses non-preferential forms only in justified lines. B's single thank spelling is in a justified line. All three think spellings set by B occur in justified lines. The one took form set by B is in a justified line. In fact, every single one of the non-preferential - k forms set by B, both the ones reproducing non-preferential - k forms found in copy and those introducing that form over - ke in copy, occurs in justified material. The final - l /- ll group of words is strongly regulated by B's clearly defined pattern. This pattern, however, does not render these spellings immune from the influence of justification. B consolidates all of the copy spellings of counsell to his preferred - ll form with the exception of two occurrences of counsaile both in justified lines. The one evil form set by B in nine (+J2) occurrences of the word comes in a justified line. B's one use of fal is in place of his preferred form fall within a justified line. The only ful in B's texts occurs in a justified line. B changes all of the rebel spellings found in copy to rebell but once changes rebell to rebel in a justified line. Justification clearly outranks even the strongest of B's spelling preferences as an influence on the spellings of his texts. For almost every linguistic group observed in the Paviers, the majority of exceptions to B's observable spelling patterns come in justified lines. In contrast to B's liking for initial an - spellings of ancient , one auncient spelling stands in his text in a justified line. B's preference for - inde endings is violated by two justified blinde to blind changes and the one acceptance of a justified find spelling found in copy. Both the one copy-reproducing unkindnes and the one change from unkindnesse to unkindnes in contradiction to B's preference for - nesse occur in justified lines. The one - nes form of business which appears in B's work stands in a justified line. These statistics clearly show that B's group spellings were influenced by justification. The influence of justification on Compositor B's spellings extends even to the individual words for which he displays the very strongest preference. Do has always been observed to be the strongest of B's characteristic habit spellings. B's copy contains 315 (+J68) doe spellings. Of these, B changes 303 (+J52) to do in accordance with his preference. In all ten plays, only twelve (+J16) non-characteristic doe forms come through from copy into B's texts. It is significant that, although only one in thirty of the unjustified doe forms comes through from copy, one in four of the justified doe forms does. There are only eight apparently aberrant changes of do to doe in all of the Paviers, and five out of the eight are in justified lines. Justified lines witness the majority of the aberrant do to doe changes and eight times the frequency of the doe retention in unjustified lines. The pattern of B's most noteable preference is, therefore, influenced by justification. Four other words show the various workings of the influence of justification. The general practice of both B and the compositors who set the copy used for the Paviers was the normal spelling and . In nine unjustified and twenty justified lines in copy, the copy form is &amp; . B changes five (+J16) of these forms to and and retains only four (+J4) &amp; forms. From this evidence, it appears that B preferred the spelled form but was led to follow &amp; forms occasionally. It is, therefore, significant to observe that the twenty-nine &amp; forms which B introduces in the place of copy and are all in justified lines. Clearly, B's dislike of the ampersand was a clear-cut matter except when the influence of justification was brought to bear on B and caused him to set &amp; in his text. The statistics for cloak in the Paviers are as follows. The first column indicates the copy spelling; the second column, the Pavier spelling; and the numbers, the frequency of occurrence. CLOKE - CLOAKE 1 CLOAKE - CLOAKE 3 + J1 CLOAKES - CLOAKES 1 CLOAKES - CLOKES J1*** What preference B expresses is in favor of the cloake ( s ) form. His switch of cloakes to clokes occurs in what is in fact a short line, but the need for justification can be shown to be the ultimate reason for his adopting the short form. The copy used for the Pavier contained a long, justified verse line: H umph . But cloakes and gownes ere this day many a one: 2 Henry VI , Q2 (1600), C2 v . Faced with this long verse line in copy, B started early in his line to prelude the possibility of having to justify and altered both cloakes to clokes and gownes to gowns as well as introducing &amp; for and . His line, which falls well within his measure is as follows: Hum . But clokes &amp; gowns ere this day many a one. 2 Henry VI , Q3 (1619), C2 v . Here, therefore, we see the possibility of justification, or rather, the desire to avoid long, justified verse lines, influencing the spellings in a short line which, at first glance, does not appear to have been affected by the process of justifying. Only when studied in relation to copy does the entire nature of B's spellings become clear. From is the standard spelling of this word in both the copy used for the Paviers and in B's texts. Twice in justified lines, however, B employs survivals from the elaborate system of abbreviation used in earlier printing to shorten from . Once he uses the tilde to change copy from to frõ , and another time he uses the umlaut to change from to frö . The need for justification was strong enough, therefore, to lead B to introduce archaic abbreviations in place of standard spellings. Finally, B's treatment of we sums up his use of non-preferential spellings in justified lines. The usual spelling in copy and in the Paviers is, of course, we . There are, however, twelve unjustified and fourteen justified wee forms in copy. Of these, B sets all of the unjustified and seven of the justified long forms as we . Wee is retained only in seven justified lines. In addition, B introduces fourteen wee forms in place of preferred we , all in justified lines. It requires patience to compile and review the statistical spelling evidence of the Paviers, but these comprehensive statistics make it possible, at long last, to provide a broad factual basis for the assertion that justification was indeed accomplished by the use of variant spellings and that spellings in justified lines often reflect the need for justification rather than the compositor's spelling habits. Two inevitable conclusions which result from a survey of the statistics need to be emphasized. First, justification was an important compositorial concern which, in the group of influences at work on the compositor, ranked ahead of the tendency to set preferential spellings. Second, and a necessary result of the first conclusion, this study shows the necessity of taking justification into consideration in compositor studies which are based on spelling analysis. Compositorial analysis which does not separate evidence from justified lines is subject to contamination from justified spellings. Justification was of utmost importance in shaping the patterns of compositorial spellings.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">New Evidence on the Provenance of The Padua Prompt-Books of Shakespeare's Macbeth, Measure for Measure , and Winter's Tale by G. Blakemore Evans</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the General Introduction to volume one of Shakespearean Prompt-Books of the Seventeenth Century (1960) I suggested a connection between the so-called Padua prompt-books of Macbeth , Measure for Measure , and The Winter's Tale and Sir Edward Dering's group of amateur actors who are known to have taken part in a performance of Fletcher's Spanish Curate between 1622 and 1624. 1 Evidence now appears which makes the Dering provenience questionable, though still not impossible. This evidence is furnished by a prompt-book of Shirley's Love's Cruelty that employs a copy of the quarto of that play published in 1640. 2 An examination of the Love's Cruelty prompt-book shows beyond question that the same prompter-reviser is at work as in the Padua Macbeth and Measure for Measure . The handwriting is the same and the principal distinguishing characteristics noted for the two Padua prompt-books are present: no indication of scene settings; non-anticipative calls; indication of the act break; short horizontal line to mark exact point of entry; promptcalls enclosed between horizontal lines. 3 There is also a further link offered by actors' initials. On sig. E1 the role of the Juggler is assigned to 'T [S]' (cf. Macbeth , IV.ii.139, where 'T S' plays the Doctor), 4 and on sig. F1 v the role of the Servant is assigned to 'M r H' (cf. Macbeth , IV.ii.64, where 'M r H[e]wit' 5 plays the part of a Messenger). 6 Moreover, the same kind of imperative warning notation ('Bee [ready] / Duke [?Eubella] / Seb: [?Court]') appears on sig. I2 as that found twice in the Padua Measure for Measure (IV.iii. and V.i.259). The comparatively late date, 1640 or after, of the Love's Cruelty prompt-book makes association with a group of amateur actors performing in the early 1620's difficult to accept. If we add to this discrepancy the professional appearance of both the Padua and Shirley prompt-books, an aspect of the problem to which I called attention in my earlier discussion of the Padua prompt-books, 7 it would seem that some other more likely provenience should be sought. A survey of what may be called the proprietary rights in the four plays yields nothing helpful. Macbeth and Measure for Measure do not appear in the lists of plays belonging to a particular company after 1623, although both must at one time have been considered the property of the King's Men. The Winter's Tale , on the other hand, was still in their performing repertory as late as 1633/4, when it was revived for Court performance by that company. Love's Cruelty , originally the property of Queen Henrietta's company, was specially assigned in 1639 to the King and Queen's Young Company. 8 Obviously no suggestive pattern emerges here, and, in any case, it is unlikely that proprietary companies would have used marked printed copies when they presumably had possession of the original manuscript prompt-book. Internal evidence of provenience in the four prompt-books is slight. It consists of two names and several initials: 'M r Carlile' and 'M r Carl,' 'M r H[e]wit' (presumably the same as 'M r H' in Love's Cruelty ), 'M r K,' 'M r G,' 'E H,' and 'T S.' It may be recalled that the Dering group satisfied three of these (John Carlile, Thomas Slender, and Mr. Kemp) and that a 'Hugett' was among Dering's acquaintances. 9 Unfortunately, an examination of the pre-Restoration records 10 for professional companies or professional actors yields nothing which satisfies the evidence as well. The possible candidates for the roles of 'M r K' and 'M r G' are, of course, far too numerous to be individually helpful, but it may perhaps be significant that the records of the Prince Charles's company in the 1630's reveal an Andrew Cane (often spelled Kane), a Henry Gradwell, and a Robert Huyt (a possible spelling of Hewit) and that there was an Ezechiall Heath, who is described as "a boy of Andrew Keynes." 11 Since Heath, alas, died in October of 1639, he can have had no connection with the production of the post-1640 Love's Cruelty , although he may still be considered a shadowy possibility for the 'E H' who played a Servant in the Padua Macbeth . That an actor of Cane's or Gradwell's seniority should be assigned to such comparatively small roles need raise no problem. Doubling was common, particularly on provincial tours, and anyone not immediately concerned at that point in the play with a major role could be called on to fill in. Hence, one may infer, comes the practice of indicating the actor playing the bitpart — an attempt to keep the prompter informed as to who should be called for what was otherwise a nameless and characterless role. This group of three (or four?) Prince Charles's men exhausts, so far as I can determine, any possibly significant association of names — the Dering group excluded. It is pointless to pursue 'M r K' and 'M r G' further. Apart from the somewhat prematurely defunct Heath, the only other known actor with the initials 'E H' was Edward Horton, a boy actor associated with the King's company in 1629-30. Nothing is known of his later career. 12 For the initials 'T S' three actors may be mentioned: Thomas Swinnerton, Thomas Sands, and Thomas Seabrook. The consistent omission of 'M r ' before 'T S' in both Macbeth and Love's Cruelty would seem to exclude Thomas Swinnerton, a senior actor and leader of a provincial company from 1616. 13 Of Thomas Seabrook nothing is known, except that he had some connection with the shadowy Lady Elizabeth's company of 1628. 14 Thomas Sands, however, appears to have been a boy actor as late as 1635 and may, perhaps, be considered a more likely candidate for 'T S.' 15 The most apparently promising name, 'M r Carlile' or 'M r Carl,' yields nothing, apart from the Dering group and a Thomas Carlile who appeared in an amateur production of Peter Hausted's Rival Friends given by Queens College, Cambridge in 1631/2. 16 No professional actor of that name is known before the Restoration, and the James Carlile, who finished his apprenticeship in 1682, is much too late, in my view, to be associated with these prompt-books. 17 It must be clear by now, I think, that any alternative to the Dering provenience must remain, lacking new evidence, a matter of guesswork. As such an alternative I suggest that these four prompt-books belonged to some kind of splinter group touring in the provinces or abroad shortly before the closing of the theatres in 1642 or during the interregnum.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Vol. I, Part i, pp. 8-11. 2 This copy of Love's Cruelty is in the Bute Collection in the National Library of Scotland. Permission to make full use of it has kindly been given by the Librarian. I would like to thank Miss Marion P. Linton, Assistant Keeper, for her kindness in giving me information about this prompt-book and other play quartos in the Bute Collection. My attention was first drawn to the copy of Love's Cruelty by my friend and colleague, Professor Charles Shattuck. Also in the Bute Collection is a quarto of Middleton and Rowley's A Fair Quarrell (1622) which has been cut for presentation but was never used as a prompt-book. 3 Shakespearean Prompt-Books , I,i,30; II,i, 4-5. Besides the main prompt hand, two other hands can be distinguished: (a) a more strongly marked secretary hand adds three stage directions on sig. I2 ('Hi: drawes his sword'; 'Stabs him'; 'hee kills her'); (b) a later (?), basically italic hand, marks certain passages for content (sigs. D3 v 'Woman'; F2 'Sorrow'; H1 'Wife'; H3 'Chambermaid'). Each marking is followed by what looks like 'C:'. Miss Linton tells me that all Shirley's plays in the Bute Collection (23 of them) contain similar content markings, which suggests that they were made by somebody collecting materials for a commonplace book. The Love's Cruelty quarto has been badly cropped in binding and almost all the prompt-notations have suffered severely. The amount of actual cutting done by the prompter-reviser is comparatively slight, some of it aimed at the removal of bawdry. 4 Although I cannot be certain (because of cropping) it is likely that 'T S' also played the Page who enters on sig. H1. On sig . B3 the role of the Courtier is assigned to an actor, but all that remains is 'Mr'. 5 The name is badly damaged. I quote here the most widely accepted interpretation. See Shakespearean Prompt-Books , I,i,9 for other possibilities. 6 The prompter-reviser has also inserted a number of 'Exit' notations not called for in the text. And 'flor[ish]' is called for twice (sigs. C2, C4). 7 Shakespearean Prompt-Books , I,i,10-11. 8 G. E. Bentley, The Jacobean and Caroline Stage (1942), I, 130, 258, 331. 9 Shakespearean Prompt-Books , I,i,9. 10 The arguments advanced to support a pre-Restoration date for the Padua prompt-books ( Shakespearean Prompt-Books , I,i,7-8) are in no way affected by the Love's Cruelty prompt-book; there is the same lack of scene settings and verbal meddling with the language of the text, the prompter's calls are, with one or two exceptions, non-anticipatory, and there is a single use of the significant imperative prompter's warning. 11 Bentley, I, 307; II, 400. I am, perhaps unjustifiably, assuming some kind of acting association for Heath on the grounds that he was apparently apprenticed to Andrew Cane. I should note, however, that Bentley does not list him separately in his dictionary of players. 12 Bentley, II, 479. 13 Bentley, II, 588. 14 Bentley, II, 561. 15 Bentley, II, 560. 16 W. W.

Casson ("Notes on a Shakespearean First Folio in Padua," MLN (1936), LI, 421-423) suggests a middle or late Restoration provenience for the Padua prompt-books largely on the strength of Carlile's name.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Library of Lady Southwell and Captian Sibthorpe by Sister Jean Carmel Cavanaugh, S.L.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Few records exist to show what books the educated Renaissance woman read or owned. Sears Jayne reports that in his survey he found only three inventories of books owned by women and that two of these are "clearly collections left by deceased husbands." 1 In the Folger Shakespeare Library is a manuscript inventory of books that appears to represent a reverse situation: a collection of books that a learned Renaissance poet, Lady Anne Southwell, left to her soldier-husband, Captain Henry Sibthorpe. The inventory was not made until after Lady Southwell's death in 1636, and it cannot be proved that any of the books belonged to her rather than to her husband, who appears to have compiled the list. Yet there is sufficient evidence to warrant the belief that a substantial number of the titles had originally belonged to Lady Southwell. She had a reputation for learning, and her writing shows that the reputation was not undeserved. Her collection of poems and the notes in her manuscript reveal her interest in religion, history, philosophy, and natural science. 2 It would be reasonable to assume, since she was a religious poet, that many of the books dealing with literature and religion were largely hers and a good number of the others manifesting a more general interest likewise. As a writer she needed background reading and books for ready reference, such as the dictionaries and encyclopedic collections. Final evidence that Lady Southwell had books of her own is furnished by an inventory of her personal possessions made five years before her death, an inventory that lists three trunks of books. 3 We may conclude, then, that she came to her second husband in 1626 with a collection of books which she left to him at her death ten years later. Lady Anne Southwell, daughter of Sir Thomas Harris of Cornworthy, Devonshire, was first married to Sir Thomas Southwell of Spixworth, Norfolk, nephew of Robert Southwell, poet and martyr. For some years she lived with her husband in Ireland where he was an English planter in Munster. At his death in 1626 Lady Southwell married Captain Henry Sibthorpe, sergeant major and privy councillor of Munster. She died in Acton, Middlesex, on 2 October 1636. The manuscript, a commonplace book which later belonged to Sir Thomas Phillipps (MS. 8581) and is now in the Folger Shakepeare Library (MS.v.b.198), is bound in morocco and bears the title in gilt: Lady Southwell's Poems , 1626. Apparently, as early entries indicate, 4 the volume belonged to the Sibthorpe family and Captain Sibthorpe presented it to Lady Southwell (who retained this name) at the time of their marriage. 5 It contains a number of Lady Southwell's poems, some in her own handwriting, some presumably in that of an amanuensis, together with various memoranda in several other hands. The list of one hundred and ten books is almost certainly written by Captain Sibthorpe. Comparison of the handwriting with that of an epitaph and commendatory verses written and signed by him (fol. 73-74) after the lady's death provide all but conclusive proof that he wrote the inventory. In both instances he shows a penchant for experimentation with various hands. The captions "A List of My Bookes" (fol. 65) and "These are likewise bookes belonginge to me" (fol. 64 v ) strengthen the conviction that Captain Sibthorpe himself compiled the list. The inventory appears to have been written in three sections and at different times. The first section includes items 1-34 (fol. 65-65 v ) and would seem to have been written in the late 1630's; the second includes those from 35 to 76 (fol. 65 v -66) and may have been added in the 1640's; the third and last part from 77 to the end (fol. 66 and 64 v ) must have been entered sometime after the death of Charles I. No. 92, "The Martyrdome of King Charles" could hardly have been written before 1649. If it is the sermon by Bishop Henry Leslie, it was published in 1649. The third section contains more than a dozen books that came out in the 1640's: Nos. 79, 81, 82, 84, 87, 88, 90, 92, 94, 95, 104, and 109. The Saltmarsh-Gataker controversy (No. 81) took place in 1646 and Doctor Featley's controversial work (No. 109) appeared in two editions in 1645. These last entries date the third section as late as 1649 or 1650. We are not certain when Captain Sibthorpe died. 6 A number of the books can be identified quickly by title. But there are some baffling problems. Six of the works mentioned are listed in a format not included in the Short-Title Catalogue : Nos 37, 64, 79, 101, 103, and 104. These may represent editions no longer extant or errors by the compiler. The abbreviation "exc." which appears in Nos. 37, 48, 53, and 72 is puzzling. If it means excerpts (from excerptum ), Captain Sibthorpe might have used it to designate several small publications bound in one volume. Or it could mean manuscripts (from excusum , "writings"). No. 53, "Lex Palionis exc Challener; in Quarto," for example, might represent a collection of tracts relating to Thomas Chaloner, who signed the death warrant of Charles I. Chaloner's speeches and papers were published in 1646. If it refers to the printed speech (or manuscript) of Richard Chaloner, the work would be dated about 1643 when this unfortunate man made his speech on the scaffold shortly before being put to death. Wing lists (L1861) Lex Talionis ; or a declamation against Mr. Challener for 1647. If this is the work — and it appears probable — the second part of Sibthorpe's inventory is also in the late 1640's. No. 52 presents another problem. It reads "An Answer, to an Inuectiue ag st . R.C.: in Quarto." Various authors used these initials and it would be difficult to identify the work with any certainty, but a family relationship might offer assistance. A curate named Roger Cocks was at Acton, Middlesex, in Lady Southwell's time and is honored in one of her poems (fol. 21): "Written in commendation of Mr. Coxe (the lecturer of Acton) his booke of the birth of Christ." This work is not known but Wing (C4874) lists Cock's An Answer to a Book set forth by Sir Edward Peyton , 1642 (i.e. to Peyton's A Discourse concerning the Fitnesse of the Posture , 1642). This might well be the book in the inventory but if it is, Lady Southwell could not have seen it. Captain Sibthorpe, Lady Southwell's husband, certainly knew Roger Cocks, who sent him some memorial verses soon after the lady's death (fol. 73). The vagueness of some entries obscures the identity of a few books. Captain Sibthorpe describes one book as "An Old Dictionary in folio" (No. 16), another as "A Seruice booke in Quarto" (No. 67). In two instances he adopts the running title rather than that of the title-page (Nos. 45, 62). A marginal note "L. Elizabeth" preceding No. 51 remains unexplained. The books fall into several categories of subject matter. Roughly one-third (35 titles) might be classed as books of a religious nature: Scripture, sermons, controversy, devotional pieces. These represent Puritan, High Church, and Catholic viewpoints. About twenty are books of literary character, predominantly poetry. Another ten are translations of works from antiquity or the Middle Ages, such as Seneca's works (Nos. 48, 66) or Batman upon Bartholome (No. 61). Twenty-two of the works appear to be translations although some of them Sibthorpe may have had in the original language. Montaigne's essays, for example, (No. 18) may have been in French. The presence of a "french Testament" (No. 34) on the list might suggest that either Lady Southwell or Captain Sibthorpe read French. The fourteen titles relating to the art of warfare and military subjects undoubtedly belonged to Captain Sibthorpe, as possibly did the works relating to the Netherlands (Nos. 6,20,37), for he had performed military duty in the Low Countries. It is quite probable that some of the books reflect family interests. Robert Southwell's poems (No. 97) and Sybthorpe's controversial piece (No. 22) — a paradoxical pair — would seem to form part of a family collection. Sir Walter Raleigh's work (No. 43) suggests a possible family interest as well as a political one, for Lady Southwell's first husband, Sir Thomas Southwell, appears to have bought land from Sir Walter Raleigh in Ireland. A good number of the books, as one might expect, reflect an interest in current economic, political, and religious problems. The literary titles seem to manifest the religious and rhetorical interests of Lady Anne Southwell, as these are evidenced in her poetry. The moral allegory of Spenser's Faerie Queene (No. 13), the religious poetry of John Donne (No. 23), and the moral didacticism of Sir John Davies' Nosce Teipsum (No. 65) would naturally appeal to a poet of a strong religious bent. Similarly attractive to her would be works of academic and rhetorical achievement, such as St. Augustine's Confessions (No. 76), "Hooker's Ecclesiasticall Politie" (No. 4), and Senecan tragedies (Nos. 48, 66) — though religious tastes would also be satisfied here. There are, however, some lighter and more romantic books, such as Orlando Furioso (No. 10) and Chapman's three works (Nos. 74,91,93). One might be disappointed that more of the major writers of the period are not represented, particularly the playwrights. Yet such slight representatives of drama in similar inventories of private libraries during this period is not unusual. Captain Sibthorpe's inventory, in fact, shows that he and Lady Southwell had a private library that was quite typical. The proportion of religious books to the whole number, though perhaps lower than that obtaining in the whole body of publications of the times, is probably about what we might expect in the hands of a bookish layman. If, as we can see from the entries in the Short-Title Catalogue , over half of the material printed at the time was religious in content, the list of one hundred and ten books bears evidence that same percentage of what was printed found its way into the hands of laymen. Sermons and devotional handbooks were being read and used, especially by the more learned owners like Lady Southwell. Nor were the books of general interest lacking. One finds a wide assortment of standard works of reference for law, history, travel, and lexicography. Of the purely practical domestic books — manuals and helps for the householder, such as men like Markham and Brathwaite were turning out by the dozens — the Sibthorpe shelves contained only three: one on herbs (No. 15), one on beekeeping (No. 47), and one on plague prevention (No. 55). Such books serve to round out a family library and, together with the more intellectual works appealing to educated readers, offer a valuable study of seventeenth-century reading tastes. The only alteration I have made in the inventory is that of supplying periods after entry numbers in the second section, Nos. 34-77. Titles of identification I usually give as they appear in the Short-Title Catalogue , except in a few cases where the longer title is more helpful. I have not found it possible to establish dates for first editions of every work nor have I supplied publication dates for editions other than those Sibthorpe specifies. If, for example, he lists a folio, I have not cited dates for quarto or duodecimo publications of the same work. In many instances, though, I have tried to indicate the popularity of a work.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Sears Jayne, Library Catalogues of the English Renaissance (1956), p. 46. Mr. Jayne continues: "The tradition of the scholarly woman in Elizabethan England is certainly borne out by what is known of their books, but so far as I know no actual catalogues have survived." 2 The manuscript contains, for example, notes on "predicables" (fol.5v), a paraphrase of Seneca's "booke of Prouidence" (fol. 8), an abstract of the lives of the Roman emperors taken from Pliny and Suetonius (fol.30v. See entry 7 below) notes from St. Augustine and others (fol.66v-67), notes on animal lore (fol.68-68v), and a collection of "Apothegmes" (fol.69-69v). These, like her poems, give evidence of Lady Southwell's reading and studies. 3 An inventory of Lady Southwell's personal possessions at the time she was changing her residence from Clerkenwell to Acton in 1631 (12 and 14 May), mentions four trunks, three of which contained books (Folger MS.v.b.198, fol. 60v). 4 A number of memoranda relating to the Sibthorpe family and dating back to 1587 are found in the manuscript (fol. 5-6v). 5 The first folio of the manuscript is headed: "The workes of the Lady Ann Sothwell: Decemb. 2° 1626." Apparently this is the year of Lady Southwell's marriage to Captain Sibthorpe, for he writes at the time of her death, 1636, that she had been "tenne years" his wife (fol.74). 6 However, in his 1834 catalogue of Southwell manuscripts Thorpe remarks that Captain Sibthorpe "died in London, very old, in or about 1664." The evidence for this assertion has not been discovered. 1 The word was written Poulton's then the apostrophe and s were deleted and the comma added.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Coleridge's Lines to Thelwall : A Corrected Text and a First Version. by C. G. Martin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">E. H. Coleridge's 1912 Oxford edition of Coleridge's poems includes as the penultimate item of "Appendix I. First Drafts, Early Versions, Etc.", a 16-line poem, editorially entitled To John Thelwall , beginning "Some, Thelwall! to the Patriot's meed aspire,". A footnote reads: "Now first published from Cottle's MSS in the Library of Rugby School." 1 The source of this text is, in fact, the second of two drafts, one on either side of the sheet numbered 15 in the Rugby Ms. 2 In transcribing it, E.H.Coleridge made a number of mistakes, several substantial. The correct text reads as follows: Some, Thelwall! to the Patriot meed aspire, Who in safe rage without or rent or scar Round pictur'd strong-holds sketching mimic war Closet their valour. Thou mid thickest fire Leap'st on the Wall: therefore shall Freedom choose 5 Ungaudy flowers that chastest odour breathe, And weave for thy young locks her Mural Wreath Nor thou my song of grateful praise refuse. My ill-adventur'd Youth by Cam's slow stream Pin'd for a woman's love in slothful woe 10 First by thy fair example to glow With patriot Zeal: from Passion's feverish dream Starting I tore disdainful from my brows The Myrtle crown inwove with cypress boughs — Blest if to me in manhood's years belong 15 Thy stern simplicity &amp; vigorous song. E. H. Coleridge's transcription reads differently: 3 1. Patriot meed] Patriot's meed 2. Who in safe rage . . . scar] Who, in safe rage, . . . scar, 6. odour] odours 7. her Mural Wreath] a Mural wreath; 8. thou] there 10. woe] ease: 13. brows] brow 14. The . . . cypress boughs] A . . . Cyprian bough The manuscript pages are mounted along their vertical edge, a process which may have obscured one or two letters, or punctuation marks. In line 7, "Wreath" reaches the edge of the mounting, and a comma may have been obscured, but there is no visible basis for E.H.Coleridge's semi-colon. In line 13, "disdainful" is written above a heavily-scored word, perhaps "indignant", the reading of the first draft (see below). In line 15, "to me in manhood's years" is written below variously heavy cancellations; only "Blest if" at one end, and "belong" at the other are uncancelled, the remainder reading "in [aster] future life [to me]". (The words between square brackets are conjectural.) Of E. H. Coleridge's readings, the strangest is in line 10: "ease" for "woe", despite the fact that the latter is the rhyme word in a couplet whose second line ends in "glow". (The rhyme scheme is regular: abba / cddc / effe / gg / hh, in effect a sonnet with an extra couplet.) In line 14, the reading "Cyprian bough" for "cypress boughs" is partly accounted for by the need to find a rhyme for the previous "brow", a mistake for "brows". But "Cyprian" is pure invention.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The other manuscript version, substantially the same for lines 1-7, but giving a different and uncompleted ending for the poem, is evidently a first draft. 8-15] Nor thou this brief prelusive strain refuse From Him, whose youth thy fair example From ill-adventur'd Passion's feverish dream — 10 And stretch'd at length by Cam's slow willowy stream Pin'd for a woman's love in slothful woe [Blest be the] hour, when first Starting I tore indignant from my brows The myrtle crown inwove with cypress boughs 15 In line 13, the words in square brackets are cancelled through, and in line 15, "crown" is written above a cancelled "wreath". In the first half of the poem, line 1 has "meed" written above a cancelled "name", and line 7, "her" above heavily-scored letters, conjecturally "the".</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the considerable autobiographical interest of the finished poem, this earlier draft adds one pleasing detail, subsequently swallowed up in the more generalised self-condemnation of "My ill-adventur'd Youth": the picture in line 11 of the idling undergraduate of Jesus College "stretch'd at length by Cam's slow willowy stream". Line 14, perhaps offers an exception to the general rule that Coleridge's revisions are improvements: "I tore indignant ", especially in view of the final couplet about Thelwall's maturing influence, seems a more appropriate wording than "I tore disdainful ". Finally, over-all comparison of the two versions suggests that the poem was originally intended as a sonnet in the regulation fourteen lines (perhaps one of those Coleridge had once hoped to add to his Morning Chronicle series of November 1794-January 1795 on Eminent Contemporaries — he declared the intention as late as March 1796, and refers not unrespectfully to Thelwall in A Plot Discover'd in November 1795, in a context relevant to the poem and at a time when he had just dedicated himself to the "bloodless fight / Of Science, Freedom, and the Truth in Christ.") 4 Though the final couplet of the second draft is not represented in the first, its drift is clearly enough implied, so that first draft's broken conclusion can be read as an attempt to condense the second part of the poem within the compass of a sonnet. The attempt failed, and the second draft neither repeats it, merely tacking on the extra couplet, nor abandons the sonnet rhyming, since the last quatrain rhymes aabb , unlike its three predecessors abba . Perhaps this second failure to make a regular sonnet of the poem accounts for the fact that Coleridge rejected it from his published work. Or again, perhaps the second draft was not originally intended as final, but for later condensation into the regular 14-line form. As it stands, the poem is certainly not worse than the Morning Chronicle sonnets, so it is unlikely that Coleridge rejected it simply on grounds of merit. However, when the series was re-admitted to the light of day in the 1803 volume of poems, Coleridge had long passed the stage at which he would have been prepared to spend time and thought on a poem which hailed the Jacobin Thelwall for recovering him from an "ill-adventur'd Youth" to the republican virtues of "stern simplicity &amp; vigorous song." Having lost its chance of publication in 1796-97, the poem then remained in manuscript for good.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Poetical Works (ed. E. H. Coleridge, 1912), 1046, &amp; n. 2 Most of the sheets bounds up in the Rugby Ms. show two numbers: (i) a discontinuous series in ink at the head of one or other margin, or occasionally at topcentre; and (ii) a continuous series in pencil at top-centre. Most of the inked numbers are lightly cancelled in pencil, which suggests that the pencilled series was added, and the inked series struck out, when the sheets were bound into the volume which Shadworth H. Hodgson presented to his old school. My reference is to the pencilled number. 3 His emendation of line 11 (supplying "taught" after "example") may of course be accepted. 4 Letters (ed. E. L. Griggs, 1956), I 155-6; Essays on His Own Time (ed. Mrs. H. N. Coleridge, 3 vols., 1850), I 69-70; Poetical Works 108: 61-2. In his discussion of the pencil abbreviations on the last leaf of the Gutch Notebook, C. R. Goodring conjectures that Thelwell may have figured in the list jotted down probably in July 1795. His comments on the poem cite some of the main ms. readings, but he seems to credit the Oxford text with independent authority. He refers to "two imperfect versions among the Cottle papers at Rugby school", adding that while the poem's "general sense supports the standard Oxford readings of 'slothful ease' and 'Cyprian bough' . . . the manuscript actually reads 'slothful woe' and 'cypress boughs'." But unless some other source turns up to support the Oxford readings, these can only be understood as mistaken transcriptions from the Rugby text. E.H. Coleridge is certainly explicit enough that here was the basis of his version. Politics in the Poetry of Coleridge (1961), 226-227, 116-117.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Notes on the Destruction of The Scarlet Letter Manuscript by Matthew J. Bruccoli</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All that survives of The Scarlet Letter manuscript is the title leaf with the table of contents on its verso. 1 There are two explanations of how the manuscript was destroyed: Hawthorne's obscure — in both senses — statement, and his son Julian's commonly-accepted but apparently untrue account.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On 3 November, 1850, Hawthorne added this postscript to a letter to his bibliophilic publisher James T. Fields: "The MS. of the Scarlet Letter was burnt long ago." 2 Although the part of this letter dealing with The House of the Seven Gables — then in progress — has been printed, the postscript has remained unpublished. 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Julian Hawthorne's version first appeared in print in Hawthorne and his Circle (1903): "I have seen the manuscripts of all his tales except The Scarlet Letter , which was destroyed by James T. Fields's printers — Fields having at that time no notion of the fame the romance was to achieve, or of the value that would attach to every scrap of Hawthorne's writing" (p.52). Julian does not absolutely contradict his father, for Hawthorne did not say who did the burning, himself or the printers; nevertheless it seems unlikely that Fields would have asked Hawthorne for a manuscript that had been destroyed by the publisher's own workmen. It does, however, appear that Julian was right in stating that Fields came to a late acquisitive appreciation of The Scarlet Letter , for the manuscript went through the press early in 1850.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet, it is unwise to place total faith in Julian's testimony, for he was a confirmed feuder and something of a con-man; and there had been bad feeling between Fields and him. Indeed, his statement about The Scarlet Letter manuscript merits less than complete belief because of its curious tone of personal injury. Julian seems, somehow, to feel that he had been deprived of a manuscript he could have sold. He did, in fact, make a good thing of selling his father's papers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The publication of Hawthorne and his Circle brought a protest from Fields's widow, Annie, in a letter to Julian which has not previously been printed:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There is one passage which I think it would be well for you to omit in the reprinting of your last book. I refer to the one in which you speak of Mr. Fields as inappreciative of the "Scarlet Letter," and for that reason having burned the manuscript. If you will re-read what your father himself published upon the subject of being appreciated and helped by his publisher I think you will cross out of your mind as well as off the printed page any such thought or remark. Your father told me one day, after saying that he was glad to have me accept and treasure the manuscript of "The House of The Seven Gables", — "I wish I had the manuscript of "The Scarlet Letter" to give you also, but I put it up the chimney" You may imagine, having heard this from his own lips, how the passage in your book amazed me. Nothing is of much moment now, except the truth for your own sake, therefore you will, I am sure, cross off the passage in question and publish this brief note wherever and whenever it shall seem to you appropriate. 4</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In fairness to Julian, it should be noted that he had not charged Fields with "having burned the manuscript." What reply he made to Mrs. Fields is not known; and since Hawthorne and his Circle was not reprinted, he did not have the opportunity to revise it. Mrs. Fields, meanwhile, repeated her claim — and her defense of Fields — later in the year in a letter to Robert S. Rantoul. 5</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is unlikely, though, that Julian would have changed his story, for he repeated it — with embellishments — as late as 1931 in what has become the best-known account of the destruction of the manuscript:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By the way, I was lately in contact with a gentleman who, in the fervour of the moment, said he would pay Twenty Thousand Dollars, cash or certified check, for the original manuscript of The Scarlet Letter , to him in hand delivered. I was obliged to decline; not from any foolish pride of possession, nor because no such manuscript ever existed; but because my father, after he had written the thing, delivered it to young Mr. James T. Fields, who, not to be too late for the Spring Book Market, promptly passed it on to the printers; and they, after they had set it up, dropped the sheets into the waste-basket, or used them for pipe-lighters. I have heard Fields, in later and wiser years, bitterly lament this indiscretion. But the rash deed was committed four-score-and-one years ago, and is irrevocable. Possibly the eager virtuoso mentioned above, before making his proposition, may have been aware of its futility. Nevertheless, it was a gallant and eloquent gesture, and helps the trade. 6</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And again one is struck by Julian Hawthorne's irrational sense of outraged wallet. 7</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Washington Irving: An Unrecorded Periodical Publication by Daniel R. Barnes</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Location of this previously unrecorded item may help to solve one of the minor mysteries of the Irving bibliography. Stanley T. Williams and Mary Ellen Edge, in A Bibliography of the Writings of Washington Irving (1936, p. 165), include the following hypothetical entry under "Periodicals and Collections": *Godey's lady's book. New York [etc.] 1830-98. Irving is sometimes mentioned as a contributor to Godey's lady's book, but no contributions by him have been identified. An earlier bibliography, that of Langfield and Blackburn, 1 makes no mention of any contribution to Godey's. Irving did, however, contribute a brief item to at least one lady's book — an item which seems, up to this time, to have escaped the notice of Irving bibliographers. In The Ladies' Repository for February, 1852, a sketch entitled "Our Changing Sky and Climate" appears under Irving's byline. The text, sufficiently brief to be given entire, is as follows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our Changing Sky and Climate. by Washington Irving. LET me, reader, say a word in favor of those vicissitudes, which are too often made the subject of exclusive repining. If they annoy us occasionally by changes from hot to cold, from wet to dry, they give us one of the most beautiful climates in the world. They give us the brilliant sunshine of the south of Europe with the fresh verdure o[sic] the north. They float our summer sky with clouds of gorgeous tints or fleecy whiteness, and send down cooling showers to refresh the panting earth and keep it green. Our seasons are all poetical; the phenomena of our heavens are full of sublimity and beauty. Winter with us has none of its proverbial gloom. It may have its howling winds, and thrilling frosts, and whirling snow-storms; but it has also its long intervals of cloudless sunshine, when the snow-clad earth gives redoubled brightness to the day; when at night the stars beam with intensest luster, or the moon floods the whole landscape with her most limpid radiance; and then the joyous outbreak of our spring, bursting at once into leaf and blossom, redundant with vegetation, and vociferous with life! — and the splendors of our summer — its morning voluptuousness and evening glory — its airy palaces of sun-gilt clouds piled up in a deep azure sky; and its gusts of tempest of almost tropical grandeur, when the forked lightning and the bellowing thunder volley from the battlements of heaven and shake the sultry atmosphere — and the sublime melancholy of our autumn, magnificent in its decay, withering down the pomp and pride of a woodland country, yet reflecting back from its yellow forests the golden serenity of the sky — surely we may say that in our climate "the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth forth his handiwork; day unto day uttereth speech; and night unto night showeth knowledge." 2 As far as I am able to determine, this is the only piece Irving ever contributed to The Ladies' Repository ; it may well be the only contribution he ever made to any lady's book. It is perhaps significant that an appreciative essay of considerable length entitled "Washington Irving as a Writer" appeared in the July, 1848 issue of The Ladies' Repository and was, according to the index to that volume, the work of the editor himself, the Rev. Mr. B. F. Tefft (VIII [July, 1848] 217-220). The essay is characterized throughout by hyperbolic praise of Irving's virtues as both a man and a writer. But what is of interest here are Tefft's concluding remarks: Having given much merited praise, I will state almost my only objection to Mr. Irving. In nearly all that he has done, he has shown merely what he could do, had his subjects been better chosen. His Sketch Book and his Columbus are almost the only exceptions to this remark. In nearly all his other works, beautiful, charming, captivating as they are, a serious man feels all the while that he might have selected topics more worthy of his genius. It is true, there is next to nothing in all his writings to find fault with; his style is ever like its fountain, pure and splendid; he nowhere descends to vulgarity, even for a moment; and his morality is such as would become a minister at the altar. But, then, when we read such a man, the soul longs to see him soaring higher. We want to see him ranging in majesty through those fields, where such a spirit might meet with angels. We become almost anxious to witness the power of such a style as his on those sublime topics, which, in all ages, have formed the themes of those gifted minds, who have ever stood nearest to the bright purlieus of heaven (p. 220). It does not seem improbable that such an "invitation" as this would eventually draw forth from Irving just such a sketch as "Our Changing Sky and Climate," a sketch which, notwithstanding its brevity, must have gone far toward fulfilling the fondest wishes of the Rev. Mr. Tefft.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Speech by W. D. Howells by George Monteiro</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Bibliography of William Dean Howells contains the following item. 74-17 . "Atlantic dinner," Boston Transcript , Dec. 17, 1874, xlvii, 1. Speech (quoted and paraphrased). 1 The determination that Howells made such a speech is based apparently on the following paragraph in the Transcript account of the Atlantic's dinner for contributors held at Boston's Parker House on December 15, 1874. During the evening Mr. Howells was toasted as "The Editor of the Atlantic: Such is his impartiality that he has been known to reject his own contributions." It gave him the opportunity for a most characteristic little speech, in the course of which he retorted on those critics who sometimes find the magazine dull. He said they little know how dull he might have made it if he had chosen. "They have no idea of the master-pieces of inanity and absurdity which are each month withheld from them. They cannot understand what strong restraint the editor places upon his own gifts for their sake, and how continually he rejects his own contributions." At a later stage Mr. Howells referred to his first contributions to the Atlantic, in 1860, which were accepted by Mr. Lowell, and stated that Mr. Fields uniformly rejected everything he sent. There is no further indication of either the contents of Howells' speech or its length. There is, however, another contemporary newspaper article that provides considerably more information on the dinner in general and on Howells' performance in particular. In fact, "A Dinner on Parnassus," which appeared in the New York Tribune (18 Dec. 1874), p. 3, actually prints in full the text of Howells' "characteristic little speech" of approximately seven hundred words. This account, unsigned, was filed by Arthur Gilman, 2 then in the employ of H. O. Houghton and Company, purchaser of the Atlantic late in 1873 from James R. Osgood. To the information that this speech was printed in a contemporary account of the dinner can be added the further information that a manuscript of the speech in Howells' hand has recently come to light. 3 Made available by Houghton Mifflin Company, it is at present on deposit in Harvard's Houghton Library. Written in ink, with additional cancellations and inter-linear corrections in pencil, and spread over nine consecutively numbered half-sheets, the manuscript carries no explicit indication of the occasion for which the text was prepared. An enclosing sheet to which the pages are loosely sewn bears the penciled inscription in an unidentified hand: "Mr. H. O. Houghton — 6 Phillips Pl." This fact suggests the possibility that Gilman, after having been allowed to use the manuscript, returned it, not to Howells, but to Houghton. This may also explain its presence in the Houghton Mifflin files. The manuscript version differs slightly from that printed in the Tribune , but neither contains the reference to Lowell and to Fields which is quoted indirectly in the Transcript account. It is less likely that these were ad libitum extensions of his speech than that they were remarks offered by Howells, as master of ceremonies, at some later moment.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Some New Stephen Crane Items by George W. Hallam</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several items that should be of particular interest to students and admirers of Stephen Crane's work have recently turned up in Jacksonville, Florida. In Cora Crane's personal copy of Wounds in the Rain , preserved with the library from Brede Place which she ultimately transferred to her sporting-house in Jacksonville, now comes to light an acknowledgment letter from Moreton Frewen to Cora, a similar letter from Rudyard Kipling, and an explanatory note, in Crane's hand, about the title page of the book itself. 1 Cora's copy of Wounds in the Rain , from the English edition by Methuen in September, 1900, is in good condition. Inscribed on the inside of the front cover and partially obscured by a crayon mark are these words in Cora's hand: "This book belongs to / Mrs. Stephen Crane / 6 Milborne Grove / The Boltons / South Kinsington [ sic ]." The address represents the last in a series of London residences Cora occupied before returning to America in April, 1901. In addition to the three communications described below, Cora's copy of the book contains a commercial photograph of Crane (captioned "From 'The Bookman.' Courtesy of Dodd, Mead &amp; Co.") and a small, heavily addressed envelope which originally contained the Kipling letter. The envelope bears four postmarks (September 14, 15, 17, 18) and four addresses, each of which has been cancelled out: "Mrs. Crane / c/o Methuen Co. / 36 Essex St / Strand / London W.C."; "Mr. Alfred Plant, Esq. / 18 Bedford Row / Greys Inn"; "47 Gower St. W.C."; "47 Gower Street." 2 Cora had by this time moved into the house at 6 Milborne Grove in South Kensington, and the letter somehow reached her there. Crane had projected the eleven Cuban war stories and sketches that make up Wounds in the Rain in the latter part of 1898, while he was in the United States conferring with his publisher, Frederick A. Stokes. He resumed work on them at Brede Place in February, 1899, and completed them sometime in August or September of the same year. Methuen and Stokes published the book in England and America simultaneously, the following September, three months after Crane's death. Cora then sent copies to several important people, including Hamlin Garland, Rudyard Kipling, and Moreton Frewen, the Cranes' landlord at Brede Place. Crane had dedicated Wounds in the Rain to Moreton Frewen as a "small token of things well remembered by his friend," and Frewen wrote thanks to Cora from Ireland. His letter, dated September 28, 1900, from County Cork, is here given for the first time: My dear Mrs. Crane I have been reading these delightful and sad stories — sad perhaps chiefly because oneself is sad for the reading. Thank you for the book which I shall always value, &amp; its dedication. I hope to be over before the month is out &amp; shall come &amp; see you. Sincerely I am Moreton Frewen 3 As Crane lay dying at Badenweiler, the pressing question arose as to who would finish The O'Ruddy , and Crane declared from his deathbed that only two people could do so: Kipling and Robert Barr. He wanted Barr to finish the book and Kipling to go over the manuscript before it went to press. But despite appeals from Cora, Barr was unwilling for the time being. Frewen, in the meantime, went ahead and sought Kipling's aid. To Frewen's action Cora eagerly gave consent. On June 3 she asked him to see "if Kipling will do this for the book. Kipling is a friend of Robert Barr's." Continuing, she noted that "if Robert Barr and Mr. Kipling say they will finish it it ought to bring a £1000 — for the American and English serial rights alone. Mr. Crane expected £600 — for American serial rights." 4 Kipling thought differently. On June 15, ten days after Crane's death and on the eve of Cora's departure for the United States, he replied to Frewen: "My own opinion is — and I hold it very strongly — that a man's work is personal to him, and should remain as he made it or left it. I should have been glad to have done him a kindness, but this is not a thing a man feeling as I do can undertake." 5 Kipling's "No" of June 15 was final and The O'Ruddy , after many delays, was at last completed in July, 1903, by Robert Barr. Despite this turndown, Cora sent Kipling a copy of Wounds in the Rain when it came off the press. His acknowledgment, appearing here for the first time, is dated September, 1900, from the Elms, Rottingdean, Sussex. Dear Mrs Crane: I have to acknowledge with many thanks your kindness in sending me a copy of Stephen Crane's last book which I have read with admiration. Very sincerely Rudyard Kipling. 6 In the teeth of Kipling's refusal to associate himself with The O'Ruddy , why did Cora once more pursue him with a copy of Wounds in the Rain ? Perhaps Miss Gilkes, her biographer, has the right answer: "Her motive? Crane admired Kipling more than any other living writer, with the possible exception of Conrad; especially his war stories. This was a book of war tales. The shade of her beloved Stephen, lost to her, would be gratified in turn by Kipling's admiration. But undoubtedly, as in the case of Garland, she hoped he would review the book, so lending his own great name to enhancement of Crane's literary immortality." 7 The third item in Cora's copy of Wounds in the Rain — the note in Crane's hand — is, of course, of considerably greater literary interest and importance than the other two. The note, bearing no date, is written neatly on lined paper and reads as follows: Wounds in the Rain. A collection of stories relating to the Spanish-American war of 1898 By Stephen Crane. ____________________________ Note: The intermediate descriptive phrase should certainly appear on the cover of the book as well as on the title page. Otherwise, rain rhymes atrociously with Crane and ruins the entire effect of the singular and sinister brutality of the title. The intermediate sentence should also be made to appear in any advertisement. S. C. 8 Whether Crane gave this directive to James Pinker, his literary agent, cannot be determined, but the note itself must be considered in the light of two letters exchanged by Pinker and Crane in early February, 1900. Pinker had written that Dominick, London representative for Stokes, "thinks so long a title as the one you have chosen would seriously affect the sale of the volume, and he tells me that in view of the glut of books on the Cuban war which has appeared in America he thinks it unwise to proclaim in your title that your book deals with the same subject." 9 Crane replied promptly that he had spent two months trying to find an effective title for the book of war stories. He had decided on "Wounds in the Rain," which seemed to him "very effective." Dominick's views he held to be worthless; he was surprised that Methuen found occasion to agree with Dominick on any point. Crane continued: "The sub-title — the books on the Cuban War have for more than a year terrified the Stokes firm and they have not the slightest idea that they are now in possession of the only fairly decent book on the Cuban War which has yet been written — the sub-title, I say, can be dispenced [ sic ] with for America and become this: 'A collection of War Stories.' As for Methuen, he can adopt the same sub-title if he likes." The upshot of this argument was that Crane's explicit wishes as set forth in the heretofore unpublished note were but partially honored after his death. The American edition of Wounds in the Rain carried as a subtitle on the title page simply "War Tales"; the English edition, the full phrase "A Collection of Stories Relating to the Spanish-American War of 1898." And the cover of the book reads exactly the way Crane did not wish it to read: " Wounds in the Rain / By Stephen Crane."</field>

      <field name="heading_text">An Unpublished Review by Henry James by James Kraft</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Clifton Waller Barrett Library at the University of Virginia contains a holograph manuscript of an unpublished review by Henry James. Written late in 1865 when he was twenty-two, this review of Two Men , a contemporary novel by Elizabeth Stoddard, seems to be the second earliest extant James manuscript. 1 The young James is harshly critical of the novelist and poet Elizabeth Stoddard (1823-1902) — the wife of Richard Henry Stoddard — who published her first novel, The Morgesons , in 1862, and a third, Temple House , in 1867. These were considered by some critics of the time to combine the "romance" of Hawthorne's New England with the modern, scientific realism of Balzac. James had published his first critical article in the North American Review in October 1864. The editor of the Review , with Lowell, was Charles Eliot Norton, James's earliest publishing mentor. James wrote seven reviews for him in 1865 of authors ranging from Goethe to Louisa May Alcott, from Matthew Arnold to Harriet Prescott, one review, which was not published, of Bayard Taylor's John Godfrey's Fortunes , and the one of Mrs. Stoddard's novel. Why the review of Two Men was not printed by Norton and how it came to its present location are unknown. The manuscript was obtained by Mr. Barrett from the Seven Gables Bookshop, and had been originally in the hands of the bookseller James F. Drake. Beyond this point there is no record of the manuscript. Although its complete history is not known, one can definitely identify the article as written for the North American Review . The manuscript shows two comments in the pencil hand of its editor, Charles Eliot Norton: "Henry James Jr." is written at the top of page one (above the title written in ink by James), and two words on page eight are crossed out in pencil and the word "curiously" written in by Norton. The only other publication for which James was writing reviews at that time was E. L. Godkin's The Nation , and this journal published an unsigned review of Two Men on October 26, 1865, written by William Dean Howells. 2 While James was not alone in his criticism of Mrs. Stoddard, he did have an opinion contrary to certain important published and private judgments. Howells, who praised Mrs. Stoddard in his review in The Nation , continued to believe her an important writer. 3 A reviewer of the Round Table , a contemporary literary journal, stated that her first novel had "as much genius as power." 4 Richard Henry Stoddard, her husband, records in his autobiography a letter of praise that Hawthorne sent Mrs. Stoddard shortly after the publication of her first novel: Pray pardon me the frankness of my crude criticism, for what is the use of saying anything unless we say what we think? There are very few books of which I take the trouble to have any opinion at all, or of which I could retain any memory so long after reading them as I do of 'The Morgesons.' I hope you will not trouble yourself too much about the morals of your next book; they may be safely left to take care of themselves. 5 It may be the harshness of James's judgments of the wife of a contemporary literary figure that stopped Norton from publishing the review. Mrs. Stoddard shows an original mind struggling to portray realistically New England people controlled by environment or forcing themselves free of the limitation of social convention. Her characters are meant to express hidden, powerful streams of abnormal emotions. The author's failure, however, is that she only states that such emotions exist in her characters. She does not embody what she states in action or dialogue, and it is this failure to find action and suitable dialogue that James forcefully attacks. What is of particular interest is the firmness with which the twenty-two-year-old James avoids being taken in by Mrs. Stoddard's oddly suggestive imagination. Howells in his review succumbs. James sees it, but goes on to criticize the straining for effect that constitutes the failure of the novel. James maintains in his review that the successful novelist must seek "authentic information," "data," or "facts" from a close observation of nature. To give the reader "useful or profitable" facts to respond to is the story-teller's responsibility. If truth is faced, fully observed, the imagination can "rest"; it will have the material with which to work effectively. The writer's "honest competency to his task" will demand form in his work, or at least "mechanical coherency." The writer should seek a "unity of design," an argument clearly constructed, and action logically developed in narrative, exposition, and dialogue that suits the context. James suggests that an impression quietly given in a novel is most effectively given. What he most strongly attacks is a writer's failure to observe. Such a failure forces the imagination to work with its back to the truth. The result is uncontrolled violence: unnatural characters; "humanity and society caricatured, coarsely misrepresented and misunderstood"; an imagination straining after nature and creating vicious, morbid, vain, crude, pathological pictures. This violence is the great failure, for once it appears in a novel, nature has been distorted in order to achieve cheap dramatic effects. Such a failure to observe destroys style; it too becomes violent as it strains, like the imagination, for what is natural. Violence is mechanically infused into a feebly constructed plot; dialogue is incoherent and irresponsible. The author must then resort to the claim of being original, which is for James the name some writers give to "a flagrant absence of order in a work of art." All the responsibilities of the story-teller then fall on the reader's shoulders. The review shows how awkward James finds any situation, particularly in fiction, that appears to move out of control. James is always a conservative critic, but especially in his early reviews. Writing anonymously, he might strongly attack weakness and so appear harsh or even rash, but his attack is a methodical demand for certain clearly determined and conservative principles that he consistently articulates in his early criticism. When he errs in his judgment of Trollope as he does in this and other early essays, he errs because of a too rigid application of his standards. These standards do not greatly change, but he is able in time to be certain and tolerant; later even admitting that he likes "ambiguities and detest[s] great glares; preferring thus for my critical no less than for pedestrian progress the cool and the shade to the sun and dust of the way." 6 What the early James expects of the novelist is what he admired in Balzac and desired to be himself: the historian of society, the master of imaginative creation, the novelist of deliberate and conscious intent. It is Mrs. Stoddard's failure even to begin to be such a writer that provokes James to call her work "nonsense" and to view her novel with a detached humor. The review is written in ink on 22 sheets numbered at the top and torn on the left side from a notebook. The first and last sheets measure 20.3 cm. x 25 cm. and are unlined; sheets 2-21 measure 19.6 cm. x 24.6 cm. and are lined in blue. The first sheet contains a two-line title, 9½ lines of text, and a line at the bottom drawn on a 165° angle from left to right. Sheets 2-21 contain 11 lines of text, with a blank line left between each line of text. Sheet 22 has 14 lines of text and an ink line across the bottom. Sheets 1 and 22 contain a watermark of a three-sided shield, surrounded on two sides by stars with the words "E Pluribus Unum" across the top. Sheets 2-21 have an embossed shield in the top left corner surrounded by stars and banners with the words "Congress" at the top and "Carson's" below, both in banners. The notes to the text include all the substantive corrections made in ink by James, but not his few slips of the pen or inconsequential false starts. Also recorded in the notes are Charles Eliot Norton's one correction on the actual manuscript and two other notations on the title page not by James. At the end of the review in its present slip case is an extra page of much heavier bond, slightly larger all around than the small sheets and larger top and bottom but not in width than the large sheets. At the top of this page is written in ink the name "L. Agassiz."; it is crossed through in pencil twice. This name refers to the Harvard zoologist and geologist Louis Agassiz, whose expedition to Brazil William James was on at the time Henry James wrote this review. There is no direct relation between this name and the review; the name appears to be written in the hand of Charles Eliot Norton. Two Men. A Novel . By Elizabeth Stoddard . * New-York . Bunce and Huntington . 1865 1 A few years ago Mrs. Stoddard published a work entitled The Morgesons , which although it failed to become widely known was generally 2 spoken of as a remarkable book by those who had the good fortune to come across it. There is no doubt, however, that equally with this epithet it deserved the obscurity to which it was speedily consigned: for it was a thoroughly bad novel. It was nevertheless not to be confounded with the common throng of ignoble failures; inasmuch as no intelligent person could have read it without a lively irritation of the critical senses. To say that it was totally destitute of form is to speak from a standpoint absurdly alien to that of its author; but we may perhaps meet her on her own ground in saying that it possessed not even the slightest mechanical coherency. It was a long tedious record of incoherent dialogue between persons irresponsible in their sayings and doings even to the verge of insanity. Of narrative, of exposition, of statement, there was not a page in the book. Here and there a vivid sketch of seaside scenery bespoke a powerful fancy: but for the most part, the story was made up of disjointed, pointless repartee between individuals concerning whom the author had not vouchsafed us the smallest authentic information. She had perhaps wished us to study them exclusively in their utterances, as we study the characters of a play: but with what patience, it may be asked, does she suppose 3 a play would 4 be listened to, in which the action was at the mercy of such a method of development as she used in The Morgesons ? With what success does she conceive that the bewildered auditor could construct the argument? In spite however of the essentially abortive character of her story, it contained several elements of power. If the reader threw down the book with the sensation of having been dreaming hard for an hour, he was yet also sensible of the extraordinary vividness of the different episodes of his dream. He arose with his head full of impressions as lively as they were disagreeable. He had 5 seen humanity and society caricatured, coarsely misrepresented and misunderstood; but he had seen all this done with great 6 energy, with an undoubted sincerity, although with amazing ignorance; with shrewdness 7 and with imagination. He felt that he had read a book worthless as a performance — or perhaps worse than worthless; but valuable for what it contingently promised; a book which its author had no excuse for repeating, inasmuch as it embraced the widest limits in which a 8 mind may void itself of its vicious and morbid fancies, without causing suspicion of its vanity. 9 The volume before us is practically but a repetition of its predecessor; from which it differs only in degree. It is a better novel, because it possesses a comparative unity of design. But like The Morgesons , it is almost brutally 10 crude. Up to a certain point, to which the contagious ingenuity which fills the literary atmosphere of the day may easily carry a writer, the characters 11 are sufficiently natural; but beyond this point, where a writer's only resource is his science, his honest competency to his task, they are violently unnatural. It is probable that Mrs. Stoddard's first novel, with all its disorderly energy, bespoke a certain amount of originality. By this term it is, at all events, that most people account for a flagrant absense of order in a work of art. Now Two Men reads very much as if its author, while determined to do the best she could and to profit by increased experience, was yet still more determined not to omit at any hazard this same precious fact of originality, but to give her work an unmistakable flavouring of it. The result is that her book betrays 12 an almost mechanical infusion, in this interest, of a savage violence which she apparently believes to be a good imitation of the quiet seriousness of genius. Our expression is not too strong: the essential defects of Two Men are resumed in the fact that while it is feebly conceived, it is violently written. Violence is not strength: on the contrary it needs strength. In any but the strongest hands a violent style is fatal to truth. It is fatal to truth because of necessity it perverts everything it touches. Throughout the present volume, there is not a quiet page. What more forcible statement can we make of its inferiority? 13 We use the word style here more especially to designate the author's 14 manner of talking of human beings and of making them talk. In dealing with certain facts of nature she has frequently an admirable command of language. "That day a summer rain fell from morning till evening; it sheeted the windows with mist, hummed against the doors, and smote the roof with steady blows." There, in three lines, is the 15 in-door sensation of a rainy day, quietly given. But Mrs. Stoddard is violent when she speaks, without explicit demonstration, of her heroine's hungry soul. 16 She is violent when she says that the same 17 young lady has speckled eyes and feathery hair. From these data and from the condensed and mystic utterance which occasionally break the pregnant silence which seems to be her rôle in the story, as well as from the circumstance that she is declared by one of her companions to be the American Sphinx, and by another to embody the Genius of the Republic, we are expected to deduce the heroine's 18 character. Perhaps we are very stupid, but we utterly fail to do so. For us, too, she remains the American Sphinx. Nor have we much better luck with her companions. It is Mrs. Stoddard's practice to shift all her responsibilities as story-teller upon the reader's shoulders, and to give herself up at the critical moment to the delight of manufacturing incoherent dialogue or of uttering grim impertinences 19 about her characters. This is doubtless very good fun for Mrs. Stoddard; but it is poor fun for us. 20 Take her 21 treatment of her hero. What useful or profitable fact has she told us about him? We do not of course speak of facts which we may apply to our moral edification; but of facts which may help us to read the story. Is he a man? 22 Is 23 he a 24 character, a mind, a heart, a soul? You wouldn't suppose it from anything Mrs. Stoddard has said, or has made him say. What is his formula? Is it that like Carlyle's Mirabeau he has swallowed all formulas? A silence like the 25 stage imitation of 26 thunder interrupted by remarks like the stage imitation of flashes of lightning; such to our perceptions are the chief attributes of Jason Auster. And yet he figures as a hero; he sustains a tragedy, he is the subject of a passion. Like Mr. Gradgrind in Dickens's Hard Times , what the novel-reader craves above all things is facts . No matter how fictitious they may be, so long as they are facts. A hungry soul 27 is no fact at all, without a context, which Mrs. Stoddard has not given. Speckled eyes and feathery hair are worthless facts. Death-beds, as a general rule, are worthless facts, and there are no less than four of them in Mrs. Stoddard's short story. Nothing is so common as to see a second-rate actor "die" with effect. The secret of the 28 short breath, the groans, the contortions is easily mastered. Just so, nothing leads us more to suspect the strength of a novelist's talent than the recurrence in his pages of these pathological phenomena. They are essentially cheap tragedy. It is evidently Mrs. Stoddard's theory that plenty of natural conversation makes a novel highly dramatic. Such also 29 is Mr. Trollope's theory. Now there is no doubt but what Mrs. Stoddard has enough imagination to equip twenty Mr. Trollopes. But in the case of both writers the practice of this theory makes the cheap dramatic. 30 Both writers make their characters talk about nothing; but those of Mrs. Stoddard do it so 31 much the more ingeniously and picturesquely, thatit 32 seems at first 33 as if they were really saying something. 34 Yet this intense and 35 distorted common-place is worse than Mr. Trollope's flagrant common-place. 36 As we skim its 37 shallow depths, one reflection perpetually recurs. What a strain after nature, we exclaim at every turn, and yet what poverty! That Mrs. Stoddard strains after 38 nature shows that she admires and loves it, and for this the critic commends her: but that she utterly fails to grasp it shows that she has not seriously observed 39 it; and for this the critic censures her. We have spoken of her imagination. She has exercised it with her back turned upon the truth. Let her face the truth and she may let her imagination rest: as it is, it only brings her intotrouble. 40 A middle-aged 41 man who loves a young girl for years in silence, knowing that she loves his own son: who quietly and heroically awaits his wife's death, knowing that she hates the young girl; and who at last when his wife is dead and 42 his son has gone forth from home, casts out his heart at the young girl's feet: all this makes a story quite after the actual taste. But like all stories that are worth the telling, it has this peculiarity, that it gives every one concerned in it a great deal to do and 43 especially the author. But Mrs. Stoddard's notion is to get all the work done by the reader while she amuses herself in talking what we feel bound to call nonsense.</field>

When Mrs. Stoddard's novels were reissued in three collected volumes (Revised Edition: Philadelphia, 1901), she gave a somewhat different version of this letter at the end of her introduction published with The Morgesons , p. vi: "Pray pardon my frankness, for what is the use of saying anything, unless we say what we think? . . . Otherwise it seemed to me as genuine and lifelike as anything that pen and ink can do. There are very few books of which I take the trouble to have an opinion at all, or of which I could retain any memory so long after reading them as I do of 'The Morgesons.'" 6 Henry James, Notes of a Son and Brother (1914), p. 106. * Reproduced by permission of C.
