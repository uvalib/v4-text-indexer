THOMAS TANSELLE DURING A FORTY-YEAR PERIOD, FROM 1966 THROUGH 2006 , I published a series of essays covering every aspect of de- scriptive bibliography. Taken together, these essays form a comprehensive treatise on the subject. Although this con- solidated work significantly revises Fredson Bowers's Principles of Biblio- graphical Description ( 1949 ) and stands on its own, I regard it not simply as a replacement for the Principles but as a companion piece to that book. After all, a classic can never be entirely superseded, and the Principles will always be worth reading for many specific passages and for the at- titude it displays: every detail is a reflection of the view that descriptive bibliography is a form of historical scholarship. No one can come away from the book without understanding that descriptive bibliography is not just a guide to the identification of first editions (though it serves that purpose) but is rather a history of the production and publication of the books taken up and thus a contribution to the broader annals of printing and publishing. Nevertheless, any work from as long ago as 1949 is likely to require some adjustments, and my essays provide a rethinking and redefinition of some basic concepts, particularly ideal copy, issue, state , and format. I have also proposed a simpler and more logical system for noting inserted leaves in collation formulas and have offered more detailed suggestions for de- scribing paper, type, non-letterpress material, and publishers' bindings. Two matters barely commented on by Bowers are given extensive discus- sion in two of my essays: the incorporation of the results of bibliographical analysis (that is, analysis of typesetting and presswork) into a descriptive bibliography, and the considerations involved in the overall organization of a bibliography (along with the numbering of its entries and the record- ing of copies examined). I have tried throughout to express, more fully than he did, the rationale lying behind the inclusion of every element in a description and the manner of presenting such features. (My detailed criticisms of certain proposals, both by him and by others, are meant to illustrate these rationales in practice.) Another important difference between Bowers's and my treatments is that he segregates his discussions of fifteenth-, eighteenth-, and nineteenth-/ twentieth-century books into three separate (and relatively short) sections, whereas my organization (according to the elements in a description) reflects the view that basic principles and procedures apply to all periods, regardless of the changing book-production details that have to be reported. His emphasis on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century books emerged from his own experience at the time (he later became thoroughly acquainted with eighteenth- and nineteenth-century books), but it leaves the Principles somewhat unbalanced. A prominent feature of his work is the fifty-eight-page treatment of the formulary notation for recording a book's structure, which is impressive in the quantity and range of situ- ations that it cites. This full account, however, has caused many people to think of the collation formula as complex and difficult, and my own discussion of it emphasizes how very simple it is. (Some books do have a complex structure, and analyzing it may be difficult; but once that result has been achieved, constructing the formula to represent it is straight- forward.) Despite the differences between Bowers's and my guides to the subject, I hope that mine is like his in showing how descriptive bibliogra- phy is an essential pursuit of scholarship in the humanities. My essays do not call for revision, in the sense that I still believe in the approach and suggestions expressed in each one. But a considerable amount of work has been done in this field since most of the essays were written, and a knowledge of that work would usefully supplement the essays. Accordingly, I am gathering here some notes on recent activity—"recent" referring, for each topic, to anything published in the years since my essay on that topic first appeared. These notes are not meant to be comprehensive surveys but only accounts of the publications that I consider most worth dis- cussing or mentioning. Sometimes I have to disagree with points that have been made, and at other times I am glad to welcome ideas that are valuable additions to what I wrote. (Further items through 2002 can be found in the 2002 revision of my Introduction to Bibliography: Seminar Syllabus , available as a Book Arts Press paperback and on the Rare Book School website.) My notes below are grouped under fourteen headings. First come five dealing with general matters: introduction to the field and its history (pp. 3–11); its relation to library cataloguing (pp. 11–14); the concept of ideal copy (pp. 15–21); the meanings of edition, impression, issue , and state (pp. 21–25); and tolerances in reporting details and the necessary equipment for doing so (pp. 25–27). The remaining nine cover more specific subjects: quasi-facsimile transcription of title pages and other text (pp. 27–29); collations of gatherings, pages, non-letterpress insertions, and contents (pp. 29–34); formal (pp. 35–37); paper (pp. 37–50; typog- raphy and layout (pp. 50–58); typesetting and presswork (pp. 58–64); non-letterpress material (pp. 64–69); publishers' bindings, endpapers, and jackets (pp. 69–89: color, pp. 71–74; patterns, pp. 75–88; jackets, pp. 88–89); and overall arrangement, including the list of examined cop- ies (pp. 89–93). Although the designation of format often precedes the collation of gatherings, this order otherwise approximates the sequence conventionally followed in a description. INTRODUCTION TO THE FIELD My general introduction to descriptive bibliography, entitled "A Des- cription of Descriptive Bibliography," was delivered as an Engelhard Lecture on the Book at the Library of Congress on 13 September 1991 . It was published in 1992 both as a pamphlet in the Viewpoints Series of the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress and as an article in Studies in Bibliography (45: 1–30); and it was republished in 1998 in my Literature and Artifacts (pp. 127–156). Four years before my lecture, David L. Vander Meulen had delivered an impressive Engelhard Lecture, Where Angels Fear to Tread: Descriptive Bibliography and Alexander Pope , which, like mine, pro- vides a rationale for the activity of describing books, showing its role as history and biography, and thus its place in humanistic scholarship. (In 2014 I pointed out the classic status of his lecture in an introduction to a new edition of it.) Since the time of these two lectures, nothing compa- rable has been published, and very few general accounts of any kind have appeared. The most important is by Vander Meulen himself, "Thoughts on the Future of Bibliographical Analysis" ( Papers of the Bibliographical So- ciety of Canada , 46 [ 2008 ], 17–33); although its emphasis is on analytical bibliography, analysis and description are inextricable, since the former must underlie the latter, and Vander Meulen's humanistic approach pro- vides the best kind of grounding. (See also my Bibliographical Analysis: A Historical Introduction , 2009 .) My 2014 Winship lecture, A Bibliographer's Creed , is not primarily about descriptive bibliography, but it includes a sec- tion (number 14) that offers a concise statement of what makes descriptive bibliography a genre of historical study and why it is a basic one. David J. Supino's 2007 Breslauer Lecture (for the American Trust for the British Library), Collecting Henry James: A Transatlantic Journey ( 2008 ), complements Vander Meulen's Engelhard Lecture in being another ac- count of the connections between collecting and descriptive bibliogra- phy, by a person who sees that variants and non-firsts are essential to the story that publishing history tells about an author's relation to the reading public. Other collector-bibliographers have also written about their experiences and made the same points. One of them, Jack W. C. Hagstrom , in "Thoughts about Contemporary Author Bibliographies" ( Gazette of the Grolier Club , n.s., 50 [ 1999 ], 27–34), stresses the value of publishers' archives and of obtaining information from authors while they are alive. For similar reflections, see Steven E. Smith's "Roy Fuller: A Bib- liographer's Thoughts on Collecting (or Vice Versa?)" ( The Private Library , 4th ser., 5 [ 1992 ], 35–47); and B. C. Bloomfield's Brought to Book: Philip Larkin and His Bibliographer ( 1995 ). All these accounts, though not compre- hensive (or intended to be), do admirably convey a sense of what descrip- tive bibliography is for and what goes into the making of a bibliography. Another commendable essay, published the same year as my lecture, is T. H. Howard-Hill's "Enumerative and Descriptive Bibliography," in The Book Encompassed , ed. Peter Davison ( 1992 ), pp. 122–129; it provides a reliable survey of some of the developments in the field in the second half of the twentieth century. (In the same volume, my essay called "Issues in Bibliographical Studies since 1942 ," pp. 24–36, covers similar ground in its section on descriptive bibliography, pp. 25–29; this essay is reprinted in my Essays in Bibliographical History [ 2013 ], pp. 53–67.) I should perhaps mention that I commented on descriptive bibli- ography in The Life and Work of Fredson Bowers ( 1993 ), pp. 40–48 and 134–137, and wrote an introduction to the 1994 printing of Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description (reprinted in my Portraits and Reviews [ 2015 ], pp. 325–333). B. J. McMullin also discussed the influence of the Principles in "Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description" ( Bibliographi- cal Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 15 [ 1991 ], 53–59); and I commented briefly on its historical place in "Bowers's Principles at Fifty" ( Studies in Bibliography , 52 [ 1999 ], 213–214). Anyone using the Principles should be aware of the variants reported by Vander Meulen in "Revision in Bibliographical Classics: 'McKerrow' and 'Bowers'" ( Studies in Bibli- ography , 52 [ 1999 ], 215–245). The relation of descriptive to enumerative bibliography (touched on in note 52 of my lecture)—including the role of description in the research for the great "short-title catalogue" projects (culminating in the online English Short-Title Catalogue )—is discussed in de- tail in my "Enumerative Bibliography and the Physical Book," published in Scholarly Publishing in Canada and Canadian Bibliography (volume 15 of Canadian Issues ), ed. Paul Aubin et al. ( 1993 ), pp. 145–159, and reprinted in my Literature and Artifacts ( 1998 ), pp. 186–199. One might expect that the Oxford and Cambridge "companions" to book history would offer dependable brief introductions to descriptive bib- liography, but that is unfortunately not the case. The Oxford Companion to the Book , ed. Michael F. Suarez and H. R. Woudhuysen ( 2010 ), finds no place in its two volumes for an essay on descriptive bibliography (though there is one on textual criticism). Instead, the subject is treated only in short scattered entries in its alphabetical section—entries that are often of little use, as when issue is said to be "distinct from the basic form of the ideal copy" and state to comprise "variants from the ideal copy not cov- ered by issue." The Cambridge Companion to the History of the Book , ed. Leslie Howsam ( 2015 ), does contain an essay by Suarez called "Book History from Descriptive Bibliographies" (pp. 199–218); but despite its inclusion of some good points, it turns out to be unsatisfactory. That a descrip- tive bibliography tells the story of a literary career and provides a partial history of publishing in the period it covers has been widely understood since Michael Sadleir's bibliography of Trollope in 1928 . This observa- tion cannot be made too often, however, and Suarez effectively conveys an enthusiasm for descriptive bibliographies and shows how they can be a "highly addictive" genre for reading. It is regrettable, therefore, that he begins with slighting comments on collation formulas as "weird" and uncongenial to humanists who may have trouble with mathematics; and he says he will not discuss such formulas in his essay. As a result, he leaves out what is the heart of every description, the detailed report of a book's physical structure. Although he recognizes how format relates to a book's "expressive form," he misses the opportunity to draw out the textual and production implications of collations of gatherings, especially when read in conjunction with lists of contents and associated pagination. (See be- low under "Collation.") Furthermore, Suarez's title, with its preposition "from," is troubling in its suggestion that descriptive bibliographies are not themselves book history but rather are a source for it. This idea permeates the essay in repeated expressions such as "what descriptive bibliography can do for book historians" (p. 201). When he speaks of "bibliographical information turned into book-historical knowledge" (p. 204), he is depict- ing descriptive bibliographies as repositories of facts ("information") that can become "knowledge" in the narratives that book historians write. Yet this view is at odds with his emphasis on how one can read bibliographies as literary and publishing histories. His piece fails to make clear that de- scriptive bibliographies, like all other historical writings, are not mere as- semblages of data but are the shaped products of informed judgment. Several manuals of bibliographical and textual study that include short treatments of descriptive bibliography have done somewhat bet- ter in explaining the field, but none is entirely satisfying. For example, D. C. Greetham's chapter "Describing the Text: Descriptive Bibliogra- phy" (pp. 153–168) in his Textual Scholarship: An Introduction ( 1992 , 1994 ) is limited to title-page transcription, signature collation, pagination register, and list of contents; and the discussion of format in the previous chapter (pp. 119–132) is not always clear and includes diagrams that are some- times useless (figure 18) or misleading (figures 24 and 27). Mark Bland's A Guide to Early Printed Books and Manuscripts ( 2010 ) gives intelligent atten- tion to book structure but falters in dealing with attachments and non- letterpress material in collation formulas (see "Collation" below). Betterl than these two is the chapter on "Descriptive Bibliography" (pp. 36–56) in the fourth (corrected) edition ( 2009 ) of William Proctor Williams and Craig S. Abbott's An Introduction to Bibliographical and Textual Studies (first published in 1985 ), though its treatment of type, paper, and binding is perfunctory. A fourth general manual, Neil Harris's Analytical Bibliography: The Alternative Prospectus ( 2002 , 2004 , 2006 ; published only online in con- nection with a course at the Institut d'Histoire du Livre at Lyon), deserves mention here, despite its brief attention to descriptive bibliography (in comments on Bowers's collation formulas), for its unusual insights, engag- ingly presented. It is a good sign that two recent books aimed at rare-book librarians have given serious attention to descriptive bibliography. Steven K. Gal- braith and Geoffrey D. Smith's Rare Book Librarianship: An Introduction and Guide ( 2012 ) includes in its second chapter ("Rare Books as Texts and His- torical Artifacts") a discussion of matters relevant to descriptive bibliogra- phy (especially "Basic Descriptive Bibliography," pp. 76–96 of the online version). But Sidney E. Berger's comprehensive Rare Books and Special Col lections ( 2014 ) gives far more instruction in descriptive bibliography, both in chapter 4 ("The Physical Materials of the Collection," pp. 77–172), which includes extensive discussions of paper, type, and binding, and in chapter 9 ("Bibliography," pp. 249–296), which deals with format, transcription, and collation, among other topics. His thorough treatment (which surpasses the accounts in the manuals mentioned in the preceding paragraph) deserves a wider audience than just rare-book librarians. In my Engelhard Lecture, I commented on many examples of descrip- tive bibliographies (and cited numerous others), and those references could now of course be supplemented from the extensive work that has been ac- complished since then. Pride of place in such a listing should probably go to A Catalogue of Books Printed in the XVth Century Now in the British Library: BMC, Part XI: England (ed. Lotte Hellinga , 2007 ), the triumphant conclu sion to the series that began publication under A. W. Pollard's direction in 1908 . Although it is a catalogue —describing a single collection—it de- serves inclusion here for its masterly technique of bibliographical descrip- tion, particularly notable for the use it makes of Paul Needham's analysis of the paper of incunables. Another outstanding descriptive catalogue is A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century Now in the Bodleian Library (by Alan Coates et al.; 6 vols., 2005 ), which is distinctive for its attention to textual matters. One more excellent catalogue to be singled out is John Meriton's Small Books for the Common Man (with Carlo Dumontet , 2010 ), which provides detailed and illustrated descriptions of 761 eighteenth- and nineteenth-century chapbooks in the National Art Library, London . It is a model for dealing with ephemeral publications, supplemented with an extensive account of the bibliographical practices employed (giving careful thought to format and paper); it also offers a lengthy essay gener- alizing about "book-making and book-trade patterns" on the basis of the physical details in the descriptions (documented with sixteen tables). A further major accomplishment is Stanley Boorman's Ottaviano Petrucci: Catalogue Raisonné ( 2006 ), which includes a long discussion of bib- liographical method. Mention should be made of four other large works, impressive even though their entries are often not as fully descriptive as one might wish (sometimes reflecting the large number of items to be ac- commodated): David Hunter's Opera and Song Books Published in England , 1703–1726 ( 1997 ), Carol Fitzgerald's "The Rivers of America": A Descriptive Bibliography (ed. Jean Fitzgerald , 2001 ), David N. Griffiths's The Bibliogra phy of the Book of Common Prayer, 1549–1999 ( 2002 ), and Roger E. Stod- dard's A Bibliographical Description of Books and Pamphlets of American Verse Printed from 1610 through 1820 (ed. David R. Whitesell , 2012 ). (For critical comments on the Griffiths work, see B. J. McMullin's extensive review in The Library , 7th ser., 6 [ 2005 ], 425–454.) In author bibliography, five new landmarks for the pre- 1850 period are Jean S. Yolton's Locke ( 1998 ), William B. Todd and Ann Bowden's Sir Walter Scott ( 1998 ), David Adams's Diderot ( 2000 ), J. D. Fleeman's Samuel Johnson (ed. James McLaverty , 2000 ), and Mark L. Reed's Wordsworth ( 2013 ). All these extraordinary works have successfully met the consider- able challenges posed by those authors; among their varying excellences is the significant attention paid to press figures. Yolton even provides, in a few instances, tables showing the distribution of figures in outer and inner formes (though it must also be noted that sometimes, for sizable books with a great many figures, only generalizations, rather than full records, are given). Impressive works inspire remarkable reviews, which are themselves valuable contributions to the literature of the field. The most notable examples are Paul Needham's of the Bodleian catalogue in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 101 ( 2007 ), 359–409 (the climax of his series of lengthy analyses of other incunable catalogues [80 ( 1986 ), 500–511 87 ( 1993 ) 93–105; 91 ( 1997 ), 539–555; 95 ( 2001 ) 173– 239]); B. J. McMullin's of the Todd-Bowden Scott in Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 23 ( 1999 ), 78–106; and David L. Vander Meulen's of the Fleeman Johnson in The Age of Johnson , 13 ( 2002 ), 389–435. Anthony James West's project for describing all copies of the Shake- speare First Folio, as finally carried out by Eric Rasmussen and five assistants in The Shakespeare First Folios: A Descriptive Catalogue ( 2012 ), is essentially an exhaustive record of copy-specific information; it must be accounted a greatly flawed landmark, despite the sound basis established by West (see especially his piece in The Library , 6th ser., 21 [ 1999 ], 1–49), because those to whom he entrusted the work were not up to the task (see the devastating review by Ian Jackson in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 108 [ 2014 ], 243–254). The volume does not supersede West's two-volume The Shakespeare First Folio: The History of the Book ( 2001–03 ), though it does contain many additional details. Another book that calls attention to itself by its size and the importance of its subject is Ann Jor- dan Laeuchli's A Bibliographical Catalog of William Blackstone (ed. James E. Mooney , 2015 ). Although it serves by default as a bibliography of Black- stone, it is not one; instead, as the title indicates, it is a catalogue—of Yale's collection, supplemented with items from other collections. It lacks many of the features expected in a bibliography, but on the level of a cata- logue it is commendable (and includes collations of gatherings, though generally without identification of formats). Of the numerous descriptive bibliographies of later nineteenth- and twentieth-century authors published since 1991 , I wish first to cite six dealing with major authors because they illustrate with particular force what can emerge from the hands of serious collectors—who continue to be, as they always have been, a major source of author bibliographies (as indeed are some of those mentioned above, such as Reed). Two of these six bibliographies are outstanding three-volume works: Kenneth Black- well and Harry Ruja's Bertrand Russell (with the assistance of Bernd Froh- mann , John G. Slater , and Sheila Turcon; 1994 ) and Ronald I. Cohen's Churchill ( 2006 ). The other four, in single volumes, also treat extensive bodies of work: Joel Myerson's Whitman ( 1993 ), Jack W. C. Hagstrom and Bill Morgan's James Merrill ( 2009 ), David A. Richards's Kipling ( 2010 ), and the 2014 revision of David Supino's Henry James: A Bibliographical Catalogue of a Collection of Editions to 1921 (first published in 2006 ). All were writ- ten by collectors, but the Russell shows the results of cooperative activity in connection with an editorial project and archive (the Russell Archive at McMaster University)—a "symbiotic" relationship, according to the introduction to the bibliography. Of the five Russell bibliographers, one, John G. Slater , formed the major Russell collection now at the Fisher Library of the University of Toronto; the other four participated over a quarter-century in filling out the other great collection, at McMaster University. Both the Russell and the Churchill are notable for the depth and intelligence of their coverage of every aspect of a vast oeuvre and are especially rich in their contribution to publishing history and biography. The level of understanding is indicated by this statement in the introduc- tion to the Russell : "Compiling the formula, and examining it for irregu- larities, can be informative of the final stages of a book's composition, in both the authorial and book-making senses of the word" (p. xxxiii). Kipling was also prolific, and the Richards bibliography uses an in- serted CD for certain categories of material and for color illustrations. The inconvenience of this arrangement is outweighed by the wealth of in formation that apparently could not feasibly have been provided in print, although the Russell and Churchill manage to do so. The thoroughness of the Hagstrom-Morgan Merrill is shown by its inclusion of dust-jacket blurbs written by Merrill , quotations from him in writings by others, and a section of "Inscriptions in Books Recorded in Book Dealers' or Auction Catalogues"; and Myerson's Whitman is notable for its handling of later printings and its use of copyright records and deposit copies. Supino's work, as its modest title indicates, claims only to be a catalogue of his James collection; but the collection includes multiple copies, variants, and non-first editions and impressions, and he has added to his descriptions extensive accounts of printing and publishing history based on research in the publishers' archives. In this instance, a descriptive catalogue of a collection supersedes the previous bibliographies of its subject. Dealers, as well as collectors, are in a privileged position for access to the copies needed for a descriptive bibliography, and perhaps the most impressive example of a recent bibliography written by a dealer is Jon Gilbert's Ian Fleming ( 2012 ); it is a monumental book of 692 very large pages, providing detailed treatment of later printings and publishing history, along with many color illustrations of bindings and jackets. Among the other post- 1991 bibliographies worth singling out for par ticular features are Wayne G. Hammond's Tolkien (with the assistance of Douglas A. Anderson , 1993 ) and Pierre Coustillan's Gissing ( 2005 ), both of which contain many narrative accounts. George Miller and Hugoe Mat thews's Richard Jefferies ( 1993 ) is noteworthy for its thorough treatment of typography, layout, binding, and periodical contributions, its record of copies with dated inscriptions, and its prefatory discussion of the scarcity of some nineteenth-century editions—which includes a statement that should be widely publicized: "Variation is the rule, not the exception, in books of the nineteenth century and well beyond. … Sometimes it is difficult to find two [copies] exactly alike in all respects." One noticeable trend in recent years has been the increased attention to dust-jackets (which some bibliographers formerly refused to treat at all). A few ex amples (out of many), in addition to the bibliographies already cited, that contain thorough jacket descriptions are Wayne G. Hammond's Arthur Ransome ( 2000 ), Brian Hubber and Vivian Smith's Patrick White ( 2004 ), and Jack De Bellis and Michael Broomfield's Updike ( 2007 ). Of the major series of descriptive bibliographies— Soho , Pittsburgh, and St. Paul's —the first publishes new titles only rarely; the second ceased publication in 2002 ; and the third, St. Paul's , was purchased in 1997 by Oak Knoll Press, which is now the leading publisher of descrip- tive bibliographies. Some of the Oak Knoll titles bear a joint imprint with St. Paul's (as they had since 1991 ); some are advertised as being part of the "Winchester Bibliographies of Twentieth Century Writers"; and some have a joint imprint with the British Library. A few of Oak Knoll's bibliographies constitute in effect a mini-series of their own, though not designated as such, for they are uniform in having a large page size and a CD inserted in a pocket at the back; examples are the Updike just men- tioned, Steven Abbott's Gore Vidal ( 2009 ), George W. Crandell's Arthur Miller ( 2011 ), and C. Edgar Grissom's Hemingway ( 2011 ). An unfortunate characteristic of this "series," however, is that in most cases signature collations are not included. Some of the post- 1991 bibliographies in the major series are the following: SOHO: Neil Brennan and A. R. Redway's Graham Greene ( 1992 ) and William S. Peterson's Betjeman ( 2006 ); PITTSBURGH : Joseph R. McElrath , Jr.'s Frank Norris ( 1992 ), George W. Crandell's Tennessee Williams ( 1995 ), Rodger L. Tarr's Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings ( 1996 ), Richard J. Schrader's Mencken ( 1998 ), and Matthew J. Bruccoli and Park Bucker's Joseph Heller ( 2002 ), plus Myerson's Whitman , already cited; ST. PAUL'S and OAK KNOLL: Leila Luedeking and Michael Edmonds's Leonard Woolf ( 1992 ), Sylvia Harlow's W. H. Davies ( 1993 ), George P. Lilley's Anthony Powell ( 1993 ), Robert Cross and Michael Perkin's Elspeth Huxley ( 1996 ), John J. Walsdorf's Julian Symons ( 1996 ), Gillian Fenwick's Orwell ( 1998 ), John Windle and Karma Pip- pin's Dibdin ( 1999 ), Donald D. Eddy's Richard Hurd ( 1999 ), Robert Cross and Ann Ravenscroft Hulme's Vita Sackville-West ( 1999 ), Peter J. Mitham's Robert Service ( 2000 ), M.

Hagstrom and Joshua S. Odell's Thom Gunn (vol. 2, 2013 ), and Michael Broomfield's Robinson Jeffers ( 2013 ), plus several already mentioned (those on Hemingway , Kipling , Merrill , Miller , Ransome , Tolkien , Up- dike , Vidal , and White ). A few other worthy bibliographies, not in these series, are Bill Morgan's Allen Ginsberg ( 1995 ), Steven E. Smith's Roy Fuller ( 1996 ), Walter Smith's Elizabeth Gaskell ( 1998 ), Carl Spadoni's Stephen Leacock ( 1998 ), Robert W. Mattila's George Sterling ( 2004 ), Rand Brandes and Michael J. Durkan's Seamus Heaney ( 2008 ), Catherine M. Parisian's Frances Burney's "Cecilia" ( 2012 ), and Carl Spadoni and Judith Skelton Grant's Robertson Davies ( 2014 ), with its extensive production details. All these post- 1991 titles obviously constitute only a selective record, intended to supplement the one in my 1991 Engelhard Lecture (primarily in notes 33–47 and related text). A few fuller, though more specialized, accounts have appeared. For earlier work, I referred in my lecture to my 1968 survey of descriptive bibliographies of American authors (note 41) and my 1975 one on eighteenth-century books (note 37)—both reprinted since then in my Essays in Bibliographical History ( 2013 ), pp. 137–160 and 283–302. A more recent survey was provided by Rodger L. Tarr in the Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook: 1995 ( 1996 ), pp. 220–234. Entitled "Primary Bibliography: A Retrospective," it assesses eight series (including Soho , Pittsburgh , and St. Paul's , along with some that offer only enumera- tion, not description) and provides convenient lists of titles in each series. In the 2002 revision of my Introduction to Bibliography , I included a selective list of some 125 descriptive bibliographies published between 1908 and 2002 (section 4C, pp. 176–179)—as well as a list of writings about descrip- tive bibliography (4B, pp. 168–175). The most extensive listings (as I noted in 1992 ) appear in my Guide to the Study of United States Imprints ( 1971 ) and T. H. Howard-Hill's Index to British Literary Bibliography ( 1969–2009 ). I have held any reference to Paul Needham's Galileo Makes a Book ( 2011 ) until my concluding comment because it serves as a model of what descriptive and analytical bibliography at the highest level can accom- plish. It is a book-length account of a single edition, Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius of 1610 . Besides an exemplary physical description, accompanied by notes on eighty-three examined copies, it provides a detailed narrative of the composition of the work and the production of the book, using (and carefully explaining) the relevant techniques of bibliographical analysis. It demonstrates not only how analysis and description are intertwined but also how the two together contribute to intellectual history. RELATION TO LIBRARY CATALOGUING I published "Descriptive Bibliography and Library Cataloguing" in Studies in Bibliography , 30 ( 1977 ), 1–56; it was reprinted in my Selected Studies in Bibliography ( 1979 ), pp. 37–92. Also in 1977 I published a more general discussion, which includes some comments on cataloguing: "Bib- liographers and the Library," Library Trends , 25 ( 1976–77 ), 745–762; re- printed in my Literature and Artifacts ( 1998 ), pp. 24–40. I have treatedy the question of the relation between references to physical books and references to verbal works much more extensively in "Enumerative Bib- liography and the Physical Book," in Scholarly Publishing in Canada and Canadian Bibliography (volume 15 of Canadian Issues ), ed. Paul Aubin et al. ( 1993 ), pp. 145–159, which is reprinted in my Literature and Artifacts ( 1998 ), pp. 186–199. (This subject was also briefly discussed by D. W. Krummel in his guide to preparing checklists, Bibliographies: Their Aims and Methods [ 1984 ]: see "The Physical and Intellectual Book," pp. 34–36.) Since the time of my 1977 essay there has been a great deal of discus sion in the library world about the requirements for cataloguing "rare books," and in 1986 the Association of College and Research Librar- ies (ACRL) began publishing a journal called Rare Books and Manuscripts Librarianship (renamed RBM: A Journal of Rare Books, Manuscripts, and Cul- tural Heritage in 2000 ). Its contents naturally impinge from time to time on matters taken up in my essay, and three articles can be singled out as particularly relevant. The first, by Laura Stalker and Jackie M. Dooley , is "Descriptive Cataloging and Rare Books" (7 [ 1992 ], 7–22), a careful historical ac- count of the thinking involved in the various revisions of the cataloguing rules that had occurred in the preceding fifteen years. (It also, in footnote 11, credits my essay with the change made in the title of the rules for special-collections cataloguers from "Bibliographic Description" to "De- scriptive Cataloging.") The second article is Michael Winship's "'What the Bibliographer Says to the Cataloger'" (7 [ 1992 ], 98–108)—part of a special issue on "Descriptive Cataloging of 19th-Century Imprints for Special Collections," ed. Stephen J. Zietz . Winship sensibly points out the overlappings among traditional branches of bibliography and notes that library cataloguers' work similarly bridges these divisions; and he prop- erly recognizes that the amount of detail in a catalogue entry is not as important a consideration as the quality of judgment involved in deciding what details are the most significant for a given class of material. His aim, like mine, is "to raise issues that may help to improve the catalog as a tool for research"; and he believes, as I do, that "our work, both as catalogers and as bibliographers, would be better if we were to talk to each other more." The third article I wish to note here is James P. Ascher's "Pro- gressing toward Bibliography; or: Organic Growth in the Bibliographic Record" (10 [ 2009 ], 95–110). As his title makes clear, Ascher proposes a process of "progressive description" (made feasible by the computer), in which records are continually enhanced as more information turns up, or certain physical features begin to attract greater interest, or the need for particular digital links becomes clearer. Implementation of this promising idea would allow "bibliographical awareness in cataloging" not to be fro- zen at the time of the initial record but to grow along with scholarship. My 1977 essay, which includes a criticism of chapter 6 of the Anglo- American Cataloguing Rules (AACR) , appeared a year before AACR was re- vised and four years before a manual specifically designed for special collections, Bibliographic Description of Rare Books ( 1981 ), was published un- der the supervision of the Office for Descriptive Cataloging Policy of the Library of Congress. A decade after that, the manual was revised (with the collaboration of the Rare Books and Manuscripts Section of ACRL) as Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Books ( 1991 ), and a third edition appeared in 2007 under the title Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books) —one of a series of manuals for different classes of "rare materials." Although the 2007 manual poses somewhat fewer problems (from the point of view of the descriptive bibliographer) than those I identified in my analysis of AACR , the same kind of confusion is still present. For example, in the chapter on "Physical Description Area" (pp. 101– 118), the first rule for recording "Extent" suggests that the emphasis will be on "physical description" by focusing on the length of the physical book rather than that of the verbal work: the rule is to "account for every leaf … including leaves of text, leaves of plates, and blank leaves"; and the leaves are to be reported by giving "the last numbered page or leaf of each numbered sequence" in the same style of numbering as that used in the book itself, with a bracketed arabic total for unnumbered pages, as in "iii, [1], 88, [2] p." One immediately wonders why this degree of specific- ity is needed if the aim is simply to show "extent"—especially since the system does not fully concentrate on the practice of the book, as shown not only in this simple example (is p. 1 numbered?) but also in several other rules, such as this one: "If it is not practical to record all the se- quences (e.g., if they are exceedingly numerous)," then one may "Record the total number of pages or leaves followed by 'in various pagings' or 'in various foliations.'" The treatment of blank leaves raises a fundamental problem: "include in the count blank leaves at the beginning of the first gathering or at the end of the final gathering when they are present in a copy in hand or known to be present in other copies." Aside from the practical question of how often a cataloguer can be expected to undertake the bibliographical research involved in learning about "other copies," there is a basic theoretical question: should not a catalogue entry always refer to the "copy in hand"? In the section on "Size and format," preci- sion in physical description is again not the focus. One example: "when the height of the publication differs by 3 centimeters or more from the height of the binding, specify both." And the brief paragraph on "biblio- graphical format" says to record it for hand-press books "whenever the format can be determined" (and speaks incorrectly of "quarto and octavo sheets"). There is no reason to extend this discussion: enough has been said to show that the standard approach to "descriptive" cataloguing in libraries remains internally inconsistent and, for the details selected for reporting, at odds with the expectations of descriptive bibliography. Shortly after my 1977 piece appeared, I received a letter from a Texas librarian complaining that I had not given cataloguers sufficient credit for dealing with the physical book. But one of her own statements illustrates the problem I was concerned with: "a monograph cataloger catalogs from a single copy of a book, but the card in the catalog stands for any num- ber of copies which may be on the shelf." This kind of wavering between the physical object and the verbal work is what I was criticizing, not the fact that cataloguers focus on fewer physical details than bibliographers do. But it does underlie the considerable debate that has occurred in the library-cataloguing world over whether the emphasis should be on the work or the "item"—a debate that seems unnecessary to bibliographers, for whom the subject of an entry must obviously be a physical item, since only through physical items can verbal works and their variants be apprehended. After the Texas librarian's imprecision, it is a pleasure to note Paul Needham's careful distinctions among work, edition , and copy in "Copy Description in Incunable Catalogues," Papers of the Bibliographi- cal Society of America , 95 ( 2001 ), 173–239 (especially "General Remarks," pp. 203–238). This is the place to mention a recent extensive study of "fingerprint- ing," since in footnote 86 I described and criticized that practice—which, like institutional library cataloguing, involves the concise reporting of a few selected features of an examined copy. The idea is that a record of the letters (in words of the text) that appear in specified positions can serve as a first step in distinguishing one edition from another. But obvi- ously such fingerprints are not very precise indicators, for they cannot identify impressions, line-for-line resettings, or resettings of any pages (or indeed any lines) not sampled. Only a full bibliographical analysis of multiple copies could result in a shorthand notation that might reliably distinguish editions (and reveal impressions) in cases where the title-page details are insufficient. Nevertheless, the idea has had a long history, and Neil Harris has now provided a thorough historical account and assess- ment of it: "Tribal Lays and the History of the Fingerprint," in Many into One: Problems and Opportunities in Creating Shared Catalogues of Older Books , ed. David J. Shaw ( 2006 ), pp. 21–72 (the essay was reprinted in 2007 as a pamphlet with two pages of errata). A variety of fingerprinting— noting the first words on the second leaf recto—is described by James Willoughby in "The Secundo Folio and Its Uses, Medieval and Modern" ( The Library , 7th ser., 12 [ 2011 ], 237–258). Finally, I wish to note two recent articles, addressed to library cata- loguers, that will be heartily applauded by bibliographers: Carlo Dumony- tet's "Nineteenth-Century Bookcloth Grain Classification and the Special Collections Cataloguer" ( Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 104 [ 2010 ], 105–112), which holds that "the description of bookcloth grains ideally ought to become a standard and integral part of catalogue rec- ords" (p. 106) and makes suggestions accordingly (see further below, under "Patterns" in "Publishers' Bindings"); and Paola Puglisi's "'The Day Has Not Yet Come …': Book-Jackets in Library Catalogs" ( Cataloging &amp; Clas- sification Quarterly , 53.3 [ 2015 ], 1–14), which proclaims "the necessity for access to the information about a single book's book-jacket directly from the library catalog." It is to be hoped that these articles reflect a trend. IDEAL COPY "The Concept of Ideal Copy," was published in Studies in Bibliography , 33 ( 1980 ), 18–53, and was reprinted, in a translation by Katia Lysy , in Filologia dei testi a stampa , ed. Pasquale Stoppelli ( 1987 ), pp. 73–105. As I complained there, the phrase "ideal copy" is unfortunate, and I can only reiterate, even more emphatically, that it should never have been invented. My essay does not appear to have affected, to any significant extent, the way the term has been used since 1980 ; and countless bibli- ographies and bibliographical discussions have continued to spread con- fusion by assuming that the concept has something to do with textual correctness and that any given impression or issue can have only one ideal copy. The basic point underlying Fredson Bowers's discussion was simply that a descriptive bibliography (as opposed to a catalogue of a collection) should not include in its basic descriptions any features of books that result from their post-publication lives. To put the matter the other way round, the descriptive bibliographer does record in a basic description all the forms that were published (as defined in the next paragraph). The variant forms of an impression (including its stop-press alterations) are its "ideal copies"—though they should not be called that. If we were to say that a description focuses on "copies as published," not on a single "ideal copy," most of the problems would go away. Defining what "as published" means is straightforward for books pub- lished in edition-bindings (that is, most books from the early nineteenth century onward, first in boards with labels, meant to be temporary, and then in cloth): it simply refers to whatever forms the finished product (printed sheets and insertions plus binding) took—even when certain leaves were expected to be removed (as in Frances Ann Kemble's Records of Later Life [ 1882 ], where the second leaf is headed "Slips for Librarian to paste on Catalogue Cards"). But for books not published in edition-bindings (including most books before the nineteenth century), the descriptive bib- liographer's focus must be, as I stated in 1980 , on the structure "specifi- cally called for by the evidence of the sheets." In the former case (books published in edition-bindings), intention plays no role, since the finished product may not have fully conformed with what the printer or publisher intended; in the latter (books not published in edition-bindings), the ob- ject to be described has to be the sheets (and insertions) in their intended structure, rather than in whatever arrangements resulted from the work of the various binders employed by the printers, publishers, or booksellers (not always different persons) or by the owners of specific copies. The role of intention in these matters can perhaps be clarified by considering a passage in David McKitterick's Print, Manuscript, and the Search for Order, 1450–1830 ( 2003 ). One of his concerns is to show how the printing process leads to variability in the printed results, and he there- fore questions the bibliographer's focus on something as seemingly fixed as an "ideal copy" (pp. 136–138). Although he speaks of my definition as "careful," he says that it "cannot embrace one of the fundamental points about early printed books: that they can remain physically uncompleted after they have left the printer's or publisher's control." But my definition does embrace this fact because it refers simply to the forms that "were released to the public by their producers," however variant or "uncom- pleted" those forms were. Printers, he says, expected and accepted varia- tions among copies, and he thus finds the idea of printers' intentions to be "unrealistic" (unless defined as "heterogeneous compromises"). Printers, however, clearly did have intentions: to carry out the publishers' inten- tions (a point discussed further below), if indeed the printers and publish- ers were not the same people. Those intentions were evidenced by clues in the printed sheets (both as to the expectation of a particular structure and as to the acceptance of textual variants). Printers and publishers obviously recognized that they could not control what would happen to those sheets in the hands of other people; but it does not follow that bibliographers are being unrealistic when (for the period before publishers' bindings) they follow the printed marks of intended structure as a way of distinguishing forms as meant to be published (including, of course, stop-press variants) from forms as modified later. Making this distinction does not deny the variability among copies or the continuity of the whole process (from printer to reader). Internal evidence for an intended structure generally takes the form of signatures, supplemented by lists of contents (including illustrations) and indications of insertion points on separately printed material. In most cases what the bibliographer describes differs from the bundles offered by printers (to publishers, booksellers, binders, or the public) only in the placement of cancels (whether printed on the text sheets or separately from them) and plates printed by intaglio processes (or, occasionally, sepa- rately printed letterpress charts or tables). Sometimes, however, there is another source of evidence: printed instructions to binders. They call for some comment that I did not provide in 1980 . The main situations in which such instructions occurred have been surveyed, with most interesting examples, by B. J. McMullin in "Print- ers' Instructions to Binders" ( Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 104 [ 2010 ], 77–104). Besides giving the locations of plates and cancels (or any other matter to be inserted), these instructions were used when the sequence of signatures was unclear or complex and when the com- ponents of a volume were distinct units without an obvious order. (In a supplementary note the same year, on pp. 353–359, McMullin gives an eighteenth-century German example of binding instructions placed along the edge of a cancellans.) The subject of "ideal copy" naturally comes up in McMullin's discussion, and he concludes (pp. 103–104) that each bibliographer must decide whether to describe "the printer's ideal copy" or "the publisher's ideal copy." This conclusion, however, by separating the printer's and the publisher's intentions, is at odds with the generally accepted (and I think correct) view that the entities to be described are either (a) copies as printed, bound, and published (if in edition-bindings) or (b) copies as intended by the printer and publisher to be formed from the published materials (if not in edition-bindings). Furthermore, his statement is misleading in suggesting that the pos- tulated decision for bibliographers has a wider area of application than it actually has. If, along with McMullin , one were to define the printer's ideal copy as "the collection of leaves that the printer intended to supply the publisher with (and thence the binder)," there are only two ways this assemblage of leaves (that is, sheets) would differ from the materials for the "publisher's ideal copy": (1) in its inclusion of binders' instructions printed either on an integral leaf that carries no other text (except possibly a binding label) or on a separate piece of paper; and (2) in its inclusion of any leaves to be canceled, along with their replacements. (Incidentally, the last phrase of McMullin's definition should properly read "to supply the binders with, sometimes by way of publishers, booksellers, or individual owners"—in order to make clear that more than one binder would have been involved, and to accommodate the variety of possible sequences, given the overlapping of the printing/publishing/bookselling functions.) When binders' instructions are printed on a leaf containing other text (such as a title page, a table of contents, an errata list, and so forth), that leaf clearly is part of the copy intended by the printer and publisher (or printer-publisher). But when copies survive with either of the kinds of leaves mentioned just above (numbered 1 and 2), the bibliographer would be justified in not including them in a basic description (reporting them instead in appended notes). In summary it must be said that McMullin's definition of "printer's ideal copy" makes the printer's intention more restricted than it clearly was. Printers (as their instructions to binders show) were looking ahead, just as much as the publishers/booksellers, to the form that readers were to receive. In his Foxcroft Lecture of 2012 ( What Readers Should Ignore on the Printed Page: Communication within the Book Trade , published in 2014 ), McMullin at first recognizes this point: "the ultimate aim of both par- ties [printers and binders]," he says, was "to ensure that the purchaser/ reader obtained what the bibliographer would call an 'ideal' copy" (p. 5). But near the end, when he asks whether printed instructions to binders "form part of the ideal copy," he again says that "from the printer's point of view they do, from the bookseller's or reader's they don't" (p. 19). It is not helpful to use ideal copy in two ways, especially since the kind of "ideal copy" that bibliographers are concerned with is the same for printers, binders, publishers, booksellers, and readers. Binders' instructions thus pose no challenge to the standard procedure for dealing with books that were not published in edition-bindings. One must remember that, in the period before edition-bindings, books could appear in a kind of publisher's binding, for booksellers can be as- sumed to have offered books in a variety of forms in addition to batches of sheets—that is, in full bindings or in gatherings, sewn or not, and with or without some form of attached wrappers or boards. This much has long been recognized in a general way; but the first person to give the mat- ter systematic attention and to search extensively for surviving evidence is Nicholas Pickwoad , who publicized his research in a lecture, "Unfin- ished Business," delivered several times in 2012–15 . He has located some 130 examples of what he calls "incomplete" or "unfinished" bindings, dating from 1485 though the eighteenth century. These are book blocks that are sewn in a permanent fashion and sometimes have boards at- tached to them but have not been finished with any covering material (though they are ready for that operation). Pickwoad distinguishes them from the "temporary" bindings that were already well known—book blocks with intact deckle edges, inexpensive sewing structures, and simple wrappers (or cheap boards) meant only to protect the sheets until they could be given permanent structures and conventional covers. (See Jona- than E. Hill , "From Provisional to Permanent: Books in Boards, 1790– 1840 ," The Library , 6th ser., 21 [ 1999 ], 247–273.) Pickwoad suggests the possibility that these two categories of "binding" may have constituted standard practice for the initial offerings of books in the hand-press pe- riod. Aaron T. Pratt has also suggested that books of all genres with short texts (especially quartos with fewer than about 96 pages) were generally sold in stab-stitched form in shops (see "Stab-Stitching and the Status of Early English Playbooks as Literature," The Library , 7th ser., 16 [ 2015 ], 304–328). Examples of unfinished or temporary bindings are understandably difficult to locate, since most were not left in their original state. (Some of the structural results of the binding process are discussed by Pickwoad in "Binders' Gatherings," The Library , 7th ser., 15 [ 2014 ], 63–78.) But when they can be identified, the makeup of their sheets can be regarded as one of the forms of ideal copy for the books concerned. However, given their scarcity (aside from the late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century boards-and-label instances)—as well as the possibility that their makeup may not differ very often from what the bibliographer would have defined as ideal copy in any case—the insights resulting from Pickwoad's and Pratt's important research may not affect the collation and contents para- graphs in most bibliographical descriptions (though they may sometimes cause a paragraph on binding to be added). Understanding these points is all the background one needs in order to see how pointless most of the discussions of ideal copy are. But the three most extensive post- 1980 treatments should perhaps be mentioned. First is Rolf E. Du Rietz's "Buyer's Emissions and Ideal Copies" ( Text [Upp- sala], 5.1 [ 1994 ], 2–38), which focuses on books from the period before edition-binding became standard. In the language of his classification scheme, "buyer's emissions" are primarily the bound copies whose con- tents were arranged by binders for individual owners. Because "original emissions" (the forms released by publishers) rarely survive (or can be identified) from this period, bibliographers must use "buyer's emissions" as sources for ideal-copy descriptions. Du Rietz apparently believes that this fact undercuts my idea that ideal copy does not encompass decisions made by individual owners or binders. But the precise forms of "buyer's emissions" are not what bibliographers would describe (except in notes on examined copies); rather, they would use the evidence available in those copies in order to determine the order of contents that was intended by the publisher—a pre-publication event. (Indeed, even if some "origi- nal emissions" survived, only those in temporary or unfinished bindings would constitute varieties of ideal copies, and the bibliographer's proce- dure would otherwise remain the same.) Du Rietz is correct, when try- ing to understand my definition of ideal copy , to suggest that my phrase "evidence of the sheets" may involve, among other things, understanding (in his words) the "generally accepted contemporary conventions"; but even so his discussion finally blurs the crucial distinction between the forms of extant copies and the forms to be described in bibliographers' basic entries. Perhaps the most useful part of his article is his detailed consideration of the binding up of serials and of works published in parts or fascicles—though he does not make clear that these situations (where the publisher has two intentions, one or both of which are often fully carried out by the publisher) are very different from the one that is his primary concern. The second extended treatment of ideal copy occurs in Stanley Boor- man's Ottaviano Petrucci: Catalogue Raisonné ( 2006 ), an extremely thorough account of this early sixteenth-century printer of music. In the 400–page introductory section (which discusses Petrucci's life and the printing and publishing conditions of his time), there is a chapter entitled "Ideal Copy: Petrucci's View of the Book, Its Character, Function, and Destination" (pp. 247–264). It begins with the "bibliographical concept," which "exists to distinguish the individual copies as they survive … from the form of a copy as it was intended to be issued by the printer or publisher" (p. 248). This definition at first seems excellent, until one learns what "intended" covers for Boorman. Intention is central to the chapter: as its subtitle sug- gests, his use of ideal copy is not primarily bibliographical but rather refers to all the aspects of text and design that the printer felt were essential "to make people like his books." In a later chapter, "Bibliographical Concepts and Terminology," the definition of ideal copy embodies this point: "an ideal copy represents a book as issued by the printer and publisher, once they were satisfied that the details of appearance and content were as they wished to see them" (p. 450). (Their satisfaction, of course, does not mean that they had noticed everything they would have liked to notice; to bring about such an ideal copy, at least as far as the text is concerned, would require a critical edition.) One clue to the printer/publisher's intention is any in-house corrections (stop-press, handwritten, or stamped), and thus those corrections become, for Boorman , part of ideal copy (even though, as he later notes [pp. 448, 449], the direction of some kinds of changes is not always clear). He recognizes that he is using the term "in a slightly idiosyncratic manner." What his usage amounts to is an expansion of the concept to encompass a corrected text in addition to (for books not in edition-bindings) an intended structure. The practical consequence is simply that a record of in-house corrections appears earlier in each de- scription (preceding the listing of contents) than is conventional. But the basic description does what any description of an ideal copy must do (for books not in edition-bindings): it sets forth the structure that complete copies should consist of, drawing on the evidence of the surviving cop- ies, all of which may be incomplete or aberrant; and Boorman carefully supplements it with detailed accounts of the individual copies. Despite the problem with his concept of ideal copy , therefore, the descriptions themselves are admirable. The third discussion is in Joseph A. Dane's Abstractions of Evidence in the Study of Manuscripts and Early Printed Books ( 2009 ), which contains a chapter called "'Ideal Copy' vs. 'Ideal Texts': The Application of Biblio- graphical Description to Facsimiles" (pp. 77–94). (Dane has commented on ideal copy elsewhere, in this book and others, but this chapter is his most thorough examination of it.) Although his discussion includes a number of questionable pronouncements, he does show some of the inconsistencies in Bowers's treatment of ideal copy and in comments by Charlton Hinman and Michael Warren about their Shakespeare facsimiles (which bring to- gether pages from different copies). He is properly critical of Hinman's notion that his facsimile of the First Folio presents "what the printers of the original edition would themselves have considered an ideal copy" and of Warren's belief that his King Lear shows the text "as the printer might have conceived it ideally." But Dane's criticism could have gone farther: a "corrected" forme is not necessarily more correct at the points of altera- tion, and in any case a forme (corrected or not) is likely to contain unno- ticed errors that a printer would not "ideally" intend. The concept of ideal copy (in either Bowers's or my formulation) has nothing to do with textual correctness. Dane recognizes this fact here (as he did not in a passage of his 2003 book, The Myth of Print Culture , where "missing quires" and "printing errors" are equally to be "filtered out" in describing an ideal copy [p. 187]). But a greater use of this recognition would have made his discussion more acute (and considerably more concise). That composite facsimiles can be regarded as critical editions is an obvious point scarcely worth extensive comment, though the fact that the editors may think they have produced ideal copies is of some interest (if irrelevant to the users). Despite Dane's criticism of some of the ways in which the term ideal copy has been employed, one leaves his discussion feeling that the usefulness of the concept has not been clarified. But the concept itself—when understood as a way of defining which features of extant books are to be excluded from descriptions because they result from the independent actions of individual owners or the vicissi- tudes of time—is fundamental to the work of bibliographers. EDITION, IMPRESSION, ISSUE , AND STATE My discussion of the basic classificatory terms in descriptive bibliog- raphy, entitled "The Bibliographical Concepts of Issue and State," was published in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 69 ( 1975 ), 17–66. I concentrated on issue and state because they have been frequently misun- derstood and less consistently employed than edition and impression , which did not seem to require further definition beyond what was generally recognized. As explained in the first few pages, edition refers to all copies resulting primarily (if not always entirely) from a single job of typographi- cal composition; and impression (or printing ) denotes all copies of an edition printed in one continuous (even if multi-day) operation. (It might be a good idea for bibliographers to use "exemplars" instead of "copies," since the latter implies lack of variation.) But no such clear-cut distinction be- tween issue and state had been (or has been even yet) regularly accepted by bibliographers, though the two refer to equally discrete situations, which can be simply stated: an issue is a group of copies of an impression that give evidence of forming a consciously planned publishing unit, whereas state refers to the kind of correction that does not call attention to itself as a marketing effort and that can only categorize an individual part of a book (such as a page or a binding), not a book as a whole (since any given book may contain mixed states). This formulation was meant as a clarification of the essential distinc- tion between the two concepts that underlay Bowers's complex definitions, and it has received some degree of acceptance. The Library of Congress and the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) adopted my approach for their rare-book cataloguing manual (see above, under "Relation to Library Cataloguing"), in which the headnote to the glossary says that the definitions of issue and state use my wording. The ACRL also commended my definitions in its Printing and Publishing Evidence: Thesauri for Use in Rare Book and Special Collections Cataloguing ( 1986 ). Other parts of the book world, however, still do not employ these definitions consistently. The introductions to bibliographies continue to display a multiplicity of variant definitions, and it is common to find state used to refer to whole copies of books. Of course, almost any definition, if carefully worded, can be usable, but confusion is bound to arise when statements from bibliog- raphies are cited without the prefatory definitions. The same kinds of variation in usage also occur in bibliographical essays. Rolf E. Du Rietz , for example, in "Buyer's Emissions and Ideal Copies" ( Text [Uppsala], 5.1 [ 1994 ], 2–38), argues that state must some- times apply to an entire book, as when a plate or leaf is inserted or deleted "without any kind of substitution or correction being directly involved" (p. 10). But the presence or absence of a plate or leaf may affect only one point in a book, just as much as a stop-press alteration or a cancel does; and when, on occasion, it affects the whole book, as an inserted dedication might, it would produce an issue. The kind of situation Du Rietz postulates provides no reason for blurring the sharp line between issue and state. And Lotte Hellinga , in "Analytical Bibliography and the Study of Early Printed Books with a Case-Study of the Mainz Catholicon " ( Gutenberg-Jahrbuch , 1989 , pp. 47–96), asserts that "'issue' always means re-setting of a substantial section of text" and that "the terms state, im- pression, issue , and edition … represent not only a rising scale of quantity of change, but also express an increasingly deliberate involvement of the printer" (p. 51). However useful these definitions may be for her discus- sion, they are not appropriate for general use. Another nonstandard use of issue occurs as part of Stanley Boorman's rethinking of the terms of classification in his Ottaviano Petrucci ( 2006 ), pp. 446–449. He states, "A single issue comprises all the copies of a book that were put on sale under the same arrangements." By saying "a book" (meaning a work) rather than "an edition," he is able to make edition subordinate to issue in some situations, as when later resettings with the same date "were intended to be sold under the same arrangements as the earlier." Those editions "were, therefore, part of the same issue." The fact that printing history and publishing history do not necessarily coincide has often been remarked on, and it is at the heart of the problem here. To make issue (a publishing term) sometimes subordinate to edition (a printing term) and sometimes not can only produce confusion. In this instance, for example, "arrangements" is not a term that reflects physical evidence: there is no way to tell from the books themselves whether or not the later editions were "put on sale under the same arrangements." Bibliographical classification, by definition, emerges from the evidence within the physi- cal object being classified, and resetting of type must be taken as the most fundamental level. If one has external evidence for linking two editions as a publishing effort, one can make a statement to that effect; but issue must be reserved for one kind of physical change within an edition. (How extensive a portion of text needs to be reset in order to call the result a different edition is, as Boorman recognizes, a separate question, and one about which opinions may vary; but he unfortunately chooses to call an individual reset sheet "a second impression of that part of the book.") As for state , Boorman understands that "the concept of a single 'state' for a whole book is meaningless," and he admirably explains the reason. One prolific bibliographer, Joel Myerson , has explicitly rejected my approach to issue in favor of Bowers's. In "Some Comments on the Bib- liographical Concept of 'Issue'" ( South Central Review , 5.1 [Spring 1988 ], 8–16), he takes up four "troublesome" kinds of situations, all of which can in fact be easily handled under my definitions. His first class of examples involves publishers' casings (bindings) and wrappers: copies of a single impression put on sale simultaneously in cloth and wrappers, or published with different series designations or publishers' names on the casings, or released with either British or American prices on the wrappers, or made available with different styles (not simply colors) of binding, such as cloth, half-calf, or full leather. The fact that there are no changes to the sheets in any of these instances should not give one pause (as it does Myerson ) because all the differences clearly identify copies that belong to separate marketing units. Myerson's second class of examples deals with dust-jackets. He cites instances where only a jacket or a box shows that the copies so housed are part of a series; but such indications are no dif- ferent from those on casings. In connection with a paste-over cancel of a publisher's name on a jacket, Myerson says, "The label on the jacket spine represents as clear a decision to issue the book by another publisher as would be changing the stamping on the casing or cancelling the title page, but do we really want to call this an issue of the book?" Why not? His third category concerns special-paper copies, and he is correct to point out that sometimes such copies constitute an impression, not an issue. But the fact that at other times they can be issues (as when the trimming of some copies creates two leaf sizes) is not altered. His final category is signed copies. When a certain number of copies are signed by the author and marketed as such, it is hard to see how they could be regarded as anything other than an issue (in contrast to the copies that are signed for particular bookstores or publication parties). Myerson feels that his examples show how some publication practices "put a strain on any definition of issue ." Every classification scheme natu- rally has to deal with borderline cases, but they do not "strain" it; rather, the classification facilitates a course of thinking that makes the particular situation stand out clearly. Myerson prefers Bowers's approach because, "by restricting issue to the sheets of a book," he "requires other evidences of marketing decisions …to be verbally described rather than definition- ally categorized." Yet Myerson recognizes that my system also "allows … descriptive or explanatory notes." Indeed, I have always maintained (and not only in this essay) that bibliographers should never hesitate to add discursive explanations in order to make a situation clear, which after all is the goal. In the end it hardly matters whether one labels a book "first impression, second issue" or "first impression, binding B," for example, as long as the significance of either one is explained. Since Myerson un- derstands that "casings and dust jackets must be considered as part of the marketing process," it is odd that he favors an approach "restricting issue to the sheets of a book" simply because it "requires" an attached ac- count of the other parts of a book that provide evidence about marketing. (Four years earlier he had held a different view, allowing casings to deter- mine issues, in a review in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 78 [ 1984 ], 48.) He is thus sacrificing the coherence of the concept of issue to a presumed advantage in presentation; but any label may at times benefit from an explanation, and the label itself should encompass the whole range of relevant possibilities. ( Matthew J. Bruccoli , in his "Editorial" for the Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook 1996 [ 1997 ], pp. 285–286, also fails to think through the concept when he asserts that issue cannot relate to bindings because "bindings have no connection with text" and claims that the "description of a book and its dust jacket are independent of each other.") In 1991 , B. J. McMullin (in "Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical De- scription," Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 15: 53–59) argued that issue , which in the Principles seems to be largely re- stricted to reissue, should be expanded to include distinct "planned units" that were published simultaneously, such as copies with different booksell- ers' imprints or copies printed on different qualities of paper (sometimes labeled with printed paper-quality marks on the first pages of gatherings). (He also referred in passing to states being formed by "corrections.") This recognition of simultaneous issues coincides with a point I had made in my 1975 essay (though I explicitly enlarged the concept to cover publish- ers' bindings as well). That so thoughtful a bibliographer as McMullin came independently to the same conclusions confirms the suitability of the definitions I have proposed and continue to advocate. Some years later McMullin reinforced his view when he studied the phenomenon of books in colonial series being converted (or converted back) to domestic issues: he advocated a fuller description of the paper, leaf dimensions, and bindings of such books as an aid to identification when there are no ver- bal changes ("Domestic—Colonial—Domestic," Biblionews and Australian Notes &amp; Queries , 361/362 [March/June 2009 ], 29–37). The implications of my definitions for the arrangement (and thus the entry numbering) of a bibliography, as well as for the uses of the impor- tant concept of subedition (and its relation to geography), all of which are taken up in section IV of the 1975 essay, were further discussed in 1984 in my essay on "Arrangement" (see below). In that later discussion, I also explained why I think the concept of subedition is preferable to that of plat- ing (proposed by James L. W. West III ) as a classification between edition and impression. And the brief treatment of ideal copy in 1975 , which serves its purpose in that context (but which does not explore the problems pres- ent in Bowers's handling of the concept), was greatly expanded five years later in my essay on that subject (see above). In the end, despite various complications that may arise in certain instances, it is important to keep in mind the essential simplicity and distinctness of the concepts underlying the four basic terms of classification. TOLERANCES In "Tolerances in Bibliographical Description" ( The Library , 5th ser., 23 [ 1968 ], 1–12; reprinted in Readings in Descriptive Bibliography , ed. John Bush Jones [ 1974 ], pp. 42–56), I attempted to provide a rationale for thinking about the degree of accuracy and the quantity of detail appro- priate for descriptive bibliographies. These two basic matters required discussion because not many bibliographers had given them systematic thought, and bibliographers still need to be reminded of their importance. The number of details covered in a given bibliography can obviously be seen by examining the bibliography, whether or not the bibliographer has thought coherently about the relative proportions of detail devoted to each described feature. (The question of "degressive" bibliography—that is, the practice of reducing the quantity of detail for certain categories of material—which is mentioned in note 1, is discussed more fully in my 1984 essay "The Arrangement of Descriptive Bibliographies" [see "Ar- rangement" below].) In contrast, the degree of accuracy in measurements cannot be known unless it is indicated in an introduction. Including some statement like "measurements are made to the nearest sixteenth of an inch" is an obvious (and undemanding) requirement. Yet in the decades since I wrote this piece, very few bibliographers have regarded such a statement as a necessity. Among those few are David L. Vander Meulen , in his bibliography of Pope's Dunciad ( 1981 dissertation); David Hunter , in Opera and Song Books Published in England 1703–1726 ( 1997 ); and Roger E. Stoddard in A Bibliographical Description of Books and Pamphlets of American Verse Printed from 1610 through 1820 ( 2012 ). But in most bibliographies, one still looks in vain for an indication of tolerances. A topic that naturally came up in my essay was what system of mea- surement to use, and I stated that the bibliographer who employs the metric system would be "clearly on the side of the future." In the nearly half-century that has elapsed since then, the United States government seems to have lost whatever interest it once had in joining most of the rest of the world in officially adopting the metric system for general purposes. (The story has been told in John Bemelmans Marciano's 2014 book, What - ever Happened to the Metric System?: How America Kept Its Feet. ) So one reason for bibliographers to use it has apparently vanished (though a candidate for the 2016 American presidential election brought the matter up). In any case, there is no question about the metric system's greater logic, and most people, I believe, find it more convenient to work with. If one wishes, or needs, to go beyond the nearest millimeter, it is easy for the eye to de- tect quarters or thirds of millimeters. My suggestion in this essay of using thirds of millimeters for measuring type faces was endorsed by Vander Meulen in his Dunciad bibliography ( 1981 dissertation). A simple solution to the quandary of what system to use would be for bibliographers to report figures in both systems (to accommodate users all over the world), placing one figure in parentheses following the other one. If one works in the metric system, one can simply divide the number of millimeters by 25.4 (or the number of centimeters by 2.54) to obtain the figure in inches; or if one works in inches, one can multiply by 25.4 (for millimeters) or 2.54 (for centimeters). Perhaps this is the place to say that bibliographical description does not require the use of elaborate equipment mainly just a ruler, a mag- nifying glass, and a micrometer), as Vander Meulen has noted in several places, such as "The Low-Tech Analysis of Early Paper" ( Literary Research , 13 [ 1988 ], 89–94). In his Engelhard lecture, Where Angels Fear to Tread: Descriptive Bibliography and Alexander Pope , published the same year (and printed in a new edition in 2014 ), he summed the matter up this way: Though modern devices such as the cyclotron have added exciting new possibilities to analysis, I, like most bibliographers, had no access to such aids. My approach was distinctly low-tech, but with tools that not enough bibliographers have learned to use well: a clear plastic ruler; a magnifying glass, with which I got a free dictionary; later, a wallet-size Fresnel lens [flat magnifier], which has served me as well as the glass; a loupe with a printed scale for measuring type size; a small flashlight; and a micrometer for recording paper thickness. One might also mention outside calipers, for measuring paper thick- ness or bulk at the center, and the Arthur Seibert Emoskop, for greater magnification. Other useful equipment, such as the NoUVIR Inner-Page Transilluminator or the Howard Eaton Pocket Viewlight (for examining paper; see "Paper" below) and collators (for comparing text and other features of two copies of an edition), can be expensive and not easily por- table and should be supplied in special-collections reading rooms. Two post- 1968 (but now somewhat outdated) discussions are Warner Barnes , "Optical and Mechanical Instruments for the Study of Rare Books and Manuscripts," Direction Line , 10 (Winter 1980 ), 21; and Paul S. Koda , "Sci- entific Equipment for the Examination of Rare Books, Manuscripts, and Documents," Library Trends , 36 ( 1987–88 ), 39–51. See "Paper" below for a few comments on Ian Christie-Miller's equipment for examining paper (and hidden text); and for a few further points about micrometers, see my 1971 essay on paper (cited under "Paper" below), in note 70 and the surrounding text. For a fuller listing of related articles, see my Introduction to Bibliography ( 2002 revision), section 9K, pp. 339–343. In my 1968 essay I briefly discussed title-page transcription, type mea- surement and identification, and color specification to illustrate the idea of levels, and I referred to the description of paper and of publishers' cloth. Two of these topics (type and color) I had previously treated at greater length in separate essays, and the others I took up in later essays, all of which are cited below. A system of alternative levels, within which one can select an appropriate degree of accuracy and quantity of detail, is important for helping one to maintain equable proportions throughout all the parts of a description—which in turn reflects an understanding of a description as a piece of historical writing. TRANSCRIPTION The first part of my "Title-Page Transcription and Signature Colla- tion Reconsidered" ( Studies in Bibliography , 38 [ 1985 ], 45–81) explained why title-page transcriptions are not superseded by photographic repro- ductions and indeed why quasi-facsimile transcription is a form of quoting that is appropriate for dealing with other parts of books besides title pages, whether or not they also happen to be reproduced. Quasi-facsimile tran- scription differs only slightly in any case from ordinary quoting (primarily by noting line-ends), and it can helpfully be employed, for example, in quoting copyright notices, printers' imprints, and section- or head-titles in the paragraph that lists the contents of the book being described. It not only gives more information than ordinary quoting about the physical presentation of the text but also can promote the discovery of variants by providing more text for comparison. Bowers's treatment of the contents paragraph—which recognizes alternative approaches that produce more compressed listings, not always involving quotation at all—is in line with my general view that different levels of detail are appropriate on differ- ent occasions (see "Tolerances" above). Nevertheless, my 1985 comments show why quasi-facsimile quoting is strongly to be preferred. The point about the complementary relationship between transcrip- tions and photographs applies of course to any form of reproduction, and therefore it can now be extended to digital images (regardless of their quality or the fact that they can easily be magnified). My 1985 piece al- luded briefly to the limitations of all reproductions, and four years later I published a detailed examination of this matter in "Reproductions and Scholarship" ( Studies in Bibliography , 52 [ 1989 ], 25–54). B. J. McMullin , in his 1999 review of the Todd-Bowden Scott bibli- ography ( Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 23: 78–106), made a useful suggestion (pp. 85–86) regarding the printing of quasi-facsimile transcriptions of title pages: that they not be set with justified right margins, so that no line-end hyphens would intrude into the transcription. Indeed, one could extend it further—to any quota- tion, whether in quasi-facsimile or not. (To say this is to raise the whole question of line-end hyphens, for the point applies to the bibliographer's own prose as well as quotations from the books being described. In many scholarly editions, there is a list of those line-end hyphens in the edited text that should be retained in quotations; but it is not realistic to expect that this practice might ever be extended to all books, though it would be logical to do so.) One other refinement in quasi-facsimile transcriptions should be re- ported here, since my reference to it in my 1985 essay could well be over- looked (at the end of note 26): David L. Vander Meulen's practice, in his Dunciad bibliography ( 1981 dissertation), of citing the type-face measure- ments of the type faces used on each title page. Measuring to the nearest third of a millimeter, he reports full height (with ascenders and descend- ers), capital height, and x-height, placing whichever measurements apply to a given line in brackets at the end of the line. When more than one apply, they are given in the above order, without further labeling; and when the same measurements apply to more than one consecutive line, the report comes at the end of those lines. This approach can obviously be extended to any other instances of quasi-facsimile transcription that involve typographic layout not covered in the paragraph on typography (where many recurrent features, such as the type faces used in the body of the text and in running titles, chapter heads, and footnotes, would be described). Anything that increases the visual information conveyed by quasi-facsimile transcription is to be embraced. COLLATION In the second part of my 1985 essay on transcription and collation (see above), I pointed out the importance of a record of gatherings (whether signed or not) for books of all periods, since the physical structure of a book is the most fundamental aspect of its description. I have frequently used the term "signature collation" only because it is a conventional one, even though what the collation formula deals with is gatherings, not sig- natures, as I said in note 63. (A true signature collation would be a com- plete register of signing—a fuller one than the kind that has typically followed the formula in the past.) The synecdochic use of "signature" to mean "gathering" is common among printers but is not (and should not be) among bibliographers, despite their tolerance of this phrase. Clearly a book without printed signatures still has a structure, and a formula representing its structure can still be constructed by assigning consecutive numbers to the gatherings. Sometimes, indeed, there are printed signa- tures that are not related to the actual gatherings; and if there are no other printed signatures that do relate to them, the formula would again have to be made from assigned numbers. (There are also instances where more than one set of printed signatures are present, and if one of them corresponds to the actual gatherings, it would of course be used.) A note should then be appended referring to the irrelevant printed signatures (irrelevant for this purpose). These points probably go without saying (and I did not mention them in 1985 ), but they may be worth noting ex- plicitly since some attention has recently been given to the phenomenon of unused signatures by B.J. McMullin , in "Gatherings and Signatures in Conflict" ( Script &amp; Print , 39 [ 2015 ], 241–247)—though McMullin is not here concerned with the collation formula. (For the bibliographical uses of these signatures, see under "Typesetting and Presswork" below.) Also in the 1985 essay I made a suggestion to correct the only seri- ous flaw in Bowers's thorough treatment of the collation formulary: his handling of insertions, where he complicated matters unnecessarily by attempting to report the signing of insertions along with their placement. My suggestion was simply to assign the number "1" to any inserted leaf and to number consecutively the inserted multiple leaves at any given point (using the conventional comma to indicate disjunct leaves and pe- riod for conjugate leaves). (The signing of inserted leaves would then be noted as part of the regular statement of signing.) This approach has been well received, as is indicated, for example, by B. J. McMullin's approval in the Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 15 ( 1991 ), 58. As a way of testing the system, he asked how one would note "an in- sertion consisting of an odd number of leaves where the one disjunct leaf is found in the middle." My answer, eight years later in the same journal (p. 108), was "1.5, 2.4, 3." Another matter relating to insertions: in note 52, I stated that an insertion of letterpress text between gatherings should be treated as an independent element and not be associated with the preceding or fol- lowing gathering; but I added (based on Bowers ), "except when the link is definitely established, as with the same signature." I think it would be better to say that a signature is normally the only acceptable link, since other links would be likely to involve excessive reliance on intellectual content, and the formula is not primarily concerned with content but with structure. This is not to say that content and structure are unrelated, for often one does learn something about the content from the structure (see below); and the content may be a help in deciding what belongs in the formula (see the next paragraph) and may even sometimes be the only way (in books not published in bindings) of determining the correct order of the gatherings. But the job of the collation formula is to record the structure of the "sheets," which are usually defined for this purpose as the folded letterpress gatherings plus any insertions (normally letterpress) that contain part of the continuous text. Thus non-letterpress insertions, which can be structurally identical to letterpress insertions, are not nor- mally included in the collation formula but instead are recorded in a separate line (see "Non-Letterpress Material" below). By separating the letterpress sheets from engraved (or lithographed) insertions, the bibliog- rapher is further clarifying a book's structure. Although distinguishing letterpress from non-letterpress is normally clear-cut, there are situations that call for the bibliographer's judgment in deciding which insertions belong in the basic formula. Because I did not comment on this matter in 1985 , and because Bowers's discussion of it ( Principles , pp. 287–289) is unclear, I shall say a word about it here. To begin with, there can be insertions that contain both letterpress and non- letterpress, and in these cases one could take the nature of the letterpress into account. If it is a caption for, or commentary on, the non-letterpress part, one could treat the insertion like any other non-letterpress insertion and list it separately from the formula. But if the insertion includes some letterpress text that connects with the adjacent text on the integral leaves, it could appropriately be treated as an element in the formula. (It would be no different from an integral leaf that contains both letterpress and an engraving, in instances where a sheet of letterpress was subsequently run through a rolling press.) Similarly, in the case of a wholly letterpress inser- tion that was clearly a separate production (and possibly of a different for- mat), such as a chart or a table, one might well decide that its inclusion in the formula would not be in line with the function of the formula, despite the fact that it is letterpress. The presence of pagination on any insertion is not enough to settle the matter, even though the resulting pagination record would sometimes show a gap that is in fact filled by information in the collation line for insertions. This approach seems sensible, but a fixed rule would probably be less satisfactory in some instances than reli- ance on the bibliographer's judgment. What is finally most important is that the bibliographer make absolutely clear, in an appended comment, what the situation is. The question whether there can ever be odd superscript numbers in a collation formula continues to come up, even though it is hard to see how the answer can be anything but an unequivocal "no" (see footnote 38 in my essay). If the function of the formula is to show book structure (as it unquestionably is), then an odd superscript does not serve the purpose because it does not show the placement of the disjunct leaf. Yet even so careful a bibliographer as J. D. Fleeman sometimes uses odd superscripts in his great Samuel Johnson ( 2000 ). The best case for odd superscripts in certain situations has been made by B. J. McMullin in "The Description of Volumes Gathered in Nines" ( Script &amp; Print , 37 [ 2013 ], 32–39). The situation arises mainly when an eighteenmo forme is imposed for gather- ing in nines rather than sixes—an arrangement that does occur in rare instances, especially in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. McMullin argues that an insertion planned as a regular part of a volume should be treated differently from leaves inserted occasionally to rectify a problem (which he calls "genuine" insertions); he also believes, since the inserted fifth leaf is often signed with a "5", that it would be unwise to treat the leaf following it as the regular fifth leaf in the gathering sim- ply because it is conjugate with the fourth leaf. His recommendation, therefore, leads to a formula on this model: "A-F 9 ($5 inserted after $4)." I do not, however, find this argument persuasive. The fact that the fifth leaf of every gathering is a singleton (and was planned to be so) does not make the structural situation any different from the one that exists for all insertions; and it would seem to be productive of confusion to say that a planned insertion after $4 should be called $5 (with the following leaf $6), whereas an unplanned one should be called $4+1 (with the following leaf $5). I believe the best approach for an eighteenmo in nines is to say "A-F 8 ($4+1)." (The actual signing would of course be recorded separately.) In this way the clarity and uniformity of the formulary does not have to be diluted, without any compensating advantages. An interesting problem for the construction of a formula arises in con- nection with Renaissance music partbooks, all of which for a given title were sold together as a unit, though each had its own title page and may or may not have had a separate alphabet of signatures. Stanley Boorman thoroughly investigated this matter in "Bibliographical Aspects of Ital- ian Printed Music of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries" ( Studies in Bibliography , 56 [ 2003–04 ], 195–242). His sensible solution is to use a bracketed letter and colon preceding the sequence of signatures for each part, thus producing a single formula for the whole series of parts but allowing the individual parts to be easily identified. A formula might begin "[C:] A-D 4 ; [T:] E- H 4 …" (with "C" and "T" referring to "canto" and "tenor"). When the parts are signed with separate alphabets, the order of parts would remain the same (for it was a conventional order): "[C:] A-D 4 ; [T:] A-D 4 …" (the bracketed letters allowing one to distin- guish the identically signed gatherings without the use of prefixed index figures, which would not be unambiguous since the order of the parts is not self-evident). Boorman's article gives 92 examples of his system in use, and he employed it in his bibliography of Ottaviano Petrucci ( 2006 ). His work illustrates how the standard formulary can be imaginatively adapted to different situations. Another example is Anthony S. Drennan's suggestion for handling volvelles (woodcut diagrams with attached circular paper disks that the reader can rotate), in "The Bibliographical Description of Astronomical Volvelles and Other Moveable Diagrams" ( The Library , 7th ser., 13 [ 2012 ], 316–339). The movable parts of a volvelle were printed on a separate leaf from the base diagram and were meant to be cut out and attached to the page where the base diagram was located. Uncut leaves printed with volvelle parts rarely survive, and generally they have no obvious lo- cation in a collation formula; but Drennan feels that the formula should somehow note the fact that such leaves were once present (even though they were not intended to be part of the structure of the book after it was bound). One might see an analogy between an uncut volvelle leaf and a cancellans, since both were meant to be removed and relocated; the im- portant difference, of course, is that the cancellans replaced another leaf, whereas the cut-out volvelle parts were attached to another leaf. Dren- nan understands that it would be unwise to try to account for the added pieces in the formula, and he properly recommends listing the completed volvelles separately. (For this purpose he has created an elaborate set of symbols for constructing a "collation formula" for each volvelle, showing its completed structure, and he appends additional commentary in words; some bibliographers may choose to avoid the formula and place the whole account in words.) The question is how to indicate in the letterpress col- lation formula that one or more uncut volvelle leaves originally accom- panied the unbound sheets. Drennan chooses the Greek letter lambda, which he places at the end of the collation, along with an indication of the number of leaves involved or, when the number is unknown, a superscript zero. (The choice of lambda is unfortunate, since Allan Stevenson used it to signify a letterpress leaf that was meant to be inserted to accompany an engraved plate.) In cases where leaves with uncut volvelle parts were printed as part of the main block of letterpress sheets, the use of lambda (or some symbol) to explain certain cancellations may be helpful, as in "B 4 (− B4 = λ1)." But simply attaching "λ1" or "λ 0 " to the end of a formula may not serve much purpose, since the record of completed volvelles (and their locations) makes clear that the book is one that incorporates cut-out pieces. Still, it takes up little space and is worth considering. A less successful way of dealing with volvelles is Mark Bland's proposal (in A Guide to Early Printed Books and Manuscripts , 2010 ) to use the Greek letter rho to indicate paper that is attached to a printed page and thus to create such an impossible expression as "P4 r + ρ1" (p. 64). He also misuses chi to refer to inserted engravings, even though the practice of treating engraved and letterpress material separately is by now well estab- lished (see above). A similarly unwise suggestion (again involving attach- ments) is Patrick Spedding's idea that a full-page paste-over cancel might be recorded in the formula with reference only to one side of the leaf, as in "(A1 v + χ1 v )", as if a leaf can be split between its recto and verso sides. But the size of a paste-over cancel is irrelevant: any patches (regardless of their size) affixed to leaves (or meant to be) should not be included in the collation formula but rather noted in a separate explanation. (See Spedding's "Cancelled Errata in John Buncle , Junior, Gentleman ," Script &amp; Print , 38 [ 2014 ] 115–121; and the responses to it by Carlo Dumontet , B. J. McMullin , John Lancaster , Richard Noble , and me on pp. 249–252.) An idiosyncratic collation system used by Robert Dawson in The French Booktrade and the "Permission Simple" of 1777 ( 1992 ) is effectively dismissed by B. J. McMullin in "Dawson Described" ( Script &amp; Print , 30 [ 2006 ], 174–180). Another proposal that is unhelpful—in this case because what it advocates is already standard—is in R. B. Williams's "Victorian Book Printing: A Rare Supernumerary Signature" ( Journal of the Printing His- torical Society , n.s., 18/19 [Summer/Winter 2012 ], 75–79). Williams notes that Charles Williams's Silver-Shell ( 1856 ) includes the signature "J" and then recommends interrupting the formula to indicate the presence of "J" ("B-I 8 J 8 K-L 8 "), since the normal practice in formulas is to assume the ab- sence of "J","U" (or "V"), and "W". This practice is obviously necessary and already well accepted. A brief discussion of some formulaic details occurs in Anthony James West's "A Model for Describing Shakespeare First Folios, with Descriptions of Selected Copies" ( The Library , 6th ser., 21 [ 1999 ], 1–49), where he reviews a few minor differences among the usages of Greg, Hinman , and Blayney (without saying what Bowers's recommendations are); the alternatives he notes are of little significance, but his preference for a colon rather than a period to signify conjugacy seems an unnecessary departure from standard practice. Although the word "collation" is generally used by descriptive bib- liographers to refer to a report of the structure of the gatherings, there are other kinds of collation (in the general sense of a verification of the order and completeness of a series of items) that enter into a description. For example, it is conventional, following the formulaic record of the gatherings, to state the number of leaves represented by the formula and then to provide a record (a collation) of pagination, showing unambigu- ously which pages have page numbers and what style of number is used (as in "pp. [i–iv] v [vi], [1] 2–4 [ 2 ] 5–11 [12]," where the bracketed italicized "2" indicates how many unnumbered pages whose pagination cannot be inferred are present at this point). For books that have inserted non-letterpress material, a separate collation of those insertions comes next (perhaps in its own "Collation" paragraph). The next paragraph in most descriptions is one headed "Contents," which indicates (preferably in quasi-facsimile quotation: see above) the intellectual content printed on every page (or group of pages), using signature notation and/or pagina- tion for reference. Because of the frequent irregularity of pagination in pre-nineteenth-century books, one should follow Bowers's advice to use signature notation instead of pagination for this period. An added benefit (pointed out by Bowers ) is that studying the relationship between produc- tion and content is thereby facilitated. (A good recent example of such a study is John Barnard's " Dryden's Virgil ( 1697 ): Gatherings and Poli- tics," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 109 [ 2015 ], 131–139.) As a result of this advantage offered by signature references, I would recommend using them for books of all periods, perhaps accompanied by page numbers. Thus the "Collation" and "Contents" paragraphs are complementary, the first collating physical makeup and the second col- lating intellectual content; when used together they help to indicate how manufacturing and meaning interact. Because I commented briefly in my 1985 essay on the relation of the gathering-collation formula to format (since both relate to structure, and a format designation often precedes the formula), I should mention that later (in 2000 ) I discussed the concept of format at length (see "Format" below). The most important post- 1985 discussion of the collation for- mula itself is in the appendix to Paul Needham's Hanes lecture, The Brad- shaw Method ( 1988 ), pp. 24–33. Although he does not propose alterations- to the presently accepted style of the collation formula, his account of its history and the principles behind it will enrich any bibliographer's understanding. FORMAT "The Concept of Format" was published in Studies in Bibliography , 53 ( 2000 ), 67–115. In it I offered a new definition of format based on the number of page-units selected to fill each side of a piece of paper or parchment of a given size; this formulation makes the concept applicable to manuscripts as well as printed matter of all kinds and periods. A few years after my essay appeared, B. J. McMullin provided what he called "an extended, if somewhat discursive, footnote" to it: "Some Notes on Paper and Format," Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 28.4 ( 2004 ), 92–104. He summarizes my arguments and gives several illustrative examples, and I appreciate his careful consideration of the points I made. I especially like his observation that, in cases where the format is uncertain and requires explication, "we should not agonise over ascribing a particular notation to the volume." His discussion does not require any modification in my essay, but readers will benefit from following his line of thinking about specific books. I do wish, however, to comment on his final paragraph. Since there are cases where the designation of format varies according to the bibliog- rapher's way of approaching it (as when double-size paper is cut before printing), he asks, "If format is an intrinsic characteristic should it ever be subject to variant designations, dependent on how it is defined?" He raises here a basic philosophical point, which relates to all description. If we grant that objects do have intrinsic qualities (as opposed to what we project onto them), those qualities can only be apprehended and reported as filtered through our individual perceptions and judgments. Every part of a bibliographical description necessarily involves analysis and interpre- tation, and the format statement is no exception. Nor is there reason to believe that, by devising a comprehensive concept of format, we might be "trying to force discrepant items into a uniform mould." The fact that we may not be able (or at least so far have not been able) to determine with certainty the format of many nineteenth- and twentieth-century books does not mean that the concept has failed. Indeed, a single concept is necessary to make clear how situations differ. The difficulty of determining the format of books printed on unwater- marked wove paper (which became increasingly common during the sec- ond half of the eighteenth century) has long been recognized, and recent research on the transitional period before and after 1800 provides the major analytical techniques to be added to those mentioned in my es- say. McMullin , in another article ("Watermarks and the Determination of Format in British Paper, 1794 – circa 1830 ," Studies in Bibliography , 56 [ 2003–04 ], 295–315), shows that format can be established for hand- made wove paper manufactured after early 1794 because it does contain a watermark as a result of a legal requirement. A refund of part of the paper tax for exported books was available if a date-watermark were eas- ily visible; thus moulds were constructed with such marks along edges, usually one or both of the longer edges, sometimes in opposite corners and sometimes in all four corners, and often with the maker's name as well. McMullin provides diagrams showing the positions of these marks in various formats, and by reference to these diagrams (which form a use- ful supplement to Gaskell's diagrams in A New Introduction to Bibliography [ 1972 , 1974 ]) one can determine the format of books printed on such paper. (A further diagram, showing edgemarks along the shorter sides of the mould, is given by Carlo Dumontet in "An Unrecorded Position of Watermarks in Early Nineteenth-Century English Paper," Script &amp; Print , 35 [ 2011 ], 111–113.) That the dates in these watermarks must be used with caution was made clear in an earlier article by Hilton Kelliher ("Early Dated Watermarks in English Paper: A Cautionary Note," in Essays in Pa- per Analysis , ed. Stephen Spector [ 1987 ], pp. 61–68): some papermakers did not change the " 1794 " watermark in later years, and it could happen that a mark would be postdated. McMullin also discusses another development of the same period: the growing use of machine-made paper. Although he indicates some ways of distinguishing machine-made from handmade paper, along with the possibility in some instances of identifying format by examining the pat- tern of original edges in uncut copies, he notes that the cutting of paper in edition-binding eliminates that possibility for most books beginning in the 1820 s. One clue that remains, however, is the seam marks (that is, the imprint left in the paper by the seams joining the ends of the wire-mesh conveyor belt that replaced the hand-held mould); and Catherine M. Ro- driguez has explained how the pattern of occurrences of these seam marks can sometimes enable one to learn the format (see "The Use of Web Seam Evidence to Determine Format," Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 28.3 [ 2004 ], 122–124). A few years later, McMullin pursued this point in an impressive article that should be read by every bibliographer dealing with pre- 1850 books printed on machine-made paper ("Machine-Made Paper, Seam Marks, and Bibliographical Analysis," The Library , 7th ser., 9 [ 2008 ], 62–88). He gives a clear description of the process of producing paper by machine and the resulting characteristics of the paper (not only seam marks and evidence of wire-belt repairs but also a thinning along the original edges as a result of slippage of the pulp under the deckle straps). Seam marks may be either vertical or horizontal in the leaves of books, or approxi- mately so—but sometimes at angles that cause them not to run through contiguous leaves in an unfolded sheet (as McMullin shows in three dia- grams). The pattern of occurrences of seam marks in a book, when stud- ied with the help of these diagrams and the standard imposition diagrams, can occasionally enable the bibliographer to determine the format—but, as McMullin cautions, additional evidence is usually needed to make a conclusive determination (except when a seam mark spans two or three gatherings). One must remember, in dealing with seam marks, that they may be present in some, but not all, copies of a gathering and thus that their pattern of occurrence will vary among the copies of an edition. ( McMullin also discusses a few other analytical uses of seam marks: see below, under "Paper.") Another difficulty related to format in books from the later eigh- teenth and the early nineteenth century is posed by the increasing use of eighteenmo (see above, under "Collation"), which raises the question of how to tell whether a book gathered in sixes is duodecimo or eigh- teenmo. Pamela E. Pryde has answered it by summarizing three imposi- tion schemes for duodecimo in sixes and two for eighteenmo in sixes, established by drawing information from eight printers' manuals (plus Gaskell); and she adds two more for eighteenmo in sixes, with diagrams ("Determining the Format of British Books of the Second-Half of the Eighteenth Century Gathered in Sixes," Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 23 [ 1999 ], 67–77 [cited for a different purpose in note 42 of my essay]). All the imposition diagrams mentioned above supplement those re- ferred to in note 82 of my essay. The relevant lists in my Introduction to Bibliography ( 2002 revision) are sections 9D6, 9F3–4, 9G6, and 9H5 (pp. 267–268, 291–293, 309–310, and 315, respectively). My Bibliographi- cal Analysis ( 2009 ) briefly summarizes the primary means for determin- ing format on pp. 38–39, 47, 53, 57–58, and 100–101 (note 12). Since format is a basic fact about every book, bibliographers should employ all available techniques for trying to discover it; thus the progress that is being made in learning how to use the evidence in machine-made paper is particularly welcome. PAPER My essay on "The Bibliographical Description of Paper" was pub- lished in Studies in Bibliography , 24 ( 1971 ), 27–67, and reprinted in Readings in Descriptive Bibliography , ed. John Bush Jones ( 1974 ), pp. 71–115, and in my Selected Studies in Bibliography ( 1979 ), pp. 203–243. I was pleased that my approach was approved by the great scholar of paper, Allan Steven- son , whom I had consulted shortly before the end of his life, when we were both doing research at the Newberry Library. Since that time four schol- ars have made the most significant advances in the study of paper from a bibliographical point of view: David L. Vander Meulen , Paul Needham , B. J. McMullin , and John Bidwell . Of their publications, the one with the widest applicability to biblio- graphical description, and a fundamental essay for the analysis of paper, is Vander Meulen's "The Identification of Paper without Watermarks: The Example of Pope's Dunciad ," in Studies in Bibliography , 37 ( 1984 ), 58–81. (Three years earlier he had discussed and illustrated the various tech- niques taken up here in his pioneering 1981 dissertation, a descriptive bibliography of Pope's Dunciad; see pp. 47–58 for his general account and pp. 72–77 for one outstanding example.) Most previous bibliographi- cal work on paper (including mine) had emphasized watermarks and the chainline spaces close to them and had either stated or implied that all the other chain spaces were equal to each other. But Vander Meulen points out that the spaces between chains in handmade paper vary within a given mould (and from one mould to another) and that the sequence of the distances between chainlines can identify the sheets produced in a single mould. Although for various reasons a given space may not be consistent in all those sheets, the variation is slight and the overall pattern is not affected. In describing books printed on handmade paper, therefore, it is not sufficient simply to say, for example, "chainlines 23 mm. apart." Instead, the whole sequence across a sheet ought to be recorded, and Vander Meulen has supplied a system that bibliographers should adopt. He uses vertical lines to separate chain-space measurements (extending the prac- tice Stevenson follows near watermarks), with three further conventions: parentheses indicate an estimated or incomplete measurement (at a gut- ter or when a sheet was cut between chainlines); ellipsis dots signify an incomplete sequence (for a partial sheet); and the percentage sign stands for a deckle edge (in parentheses when the deckle is inferred). A record (with measurements to the nearest half-millimeter, taken at the middle of the sheet) might look like this: (9) | 19 | 29.5 | 27.5 | 31 | (29) | 29.5 | 30 | 28.5 | 20 | (13) (One desirable modification suggested by John A. Lane is to use a verti- cal wavy line instead of the percentage sign: see " Arthur Nicholls and His Greek Type for the King's Printing House," The Library , 6th ser., 13 [ 1991 ], 297–322 [p. 318].) When there is a watermark, its position in the sequence should be shown, using Stevenson's system (explained in my essay); and the sequence should reflect the sheet as viewed from the mould side with the watermark right side up (the standard orientation for bibliographical use: see below for Needham's use of it). Obviously one could also view the paper from the felt side, but it usually seems easier to work with the side showing the obverse of the image. When a water- mark is not present, the orientation is not significant, since the sequence serves its purpose whether read forward or backward. The great value of giving all the chain-space measurements is that all handmade papers can thereby be identified, even when they have no watermarks or when only an unwatermarked part-sheet is present (as in some half-sheet gather- ings). In the first of the two sample descriptions near the end of my es- say, the identification of the watermark and countermark should include only the height and width measurements and should be followed (after a semicolon) by the chain-space sequence, incorporating a notation of the water mark position. The most extensive use, thus far, of Vander Meulen's observations has been made by David L. Gants and R. Carter Hailey . Although their methods of collecting data differ (Gants's is high-tech and Hailey's low- tech), they both make chain-space sequences the center of their paper descriptions—accompanied by indications of wireline density (see below) and measurements of watermarks, with digital photographs (Gants) or freehand drawings (Hailey) of the watermarks. Both follow Vander Meu- len's plan of using vertical lines to separate chain-space measurements, but each makes some modifications. Gants, when explaining his approach to building a database, says that he records the sequence for every sheet (not a representative one for any sheet from the same mould) and that he takes his measurements from either side of the watermark (not the center of the sheet), as a location accessible in a variety of formats. See "Identi- fying and Tracking Paper Stocks in Early Modern London ," in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 94 ( 2000 ), 531–540. However, in his online "A Digital Catalogue of Watermarks and Type Ornaments Used by William Stansby [ 1614–1618 ]" ( 2005 ), he does not report the sequence for each sheet individually, and he gives two chain-space sequences per mould, from the "top" and "bottom" of the sheet (that is, near the two longer edges, when the watermark is viewed in upright position). He also uses different symbols from Vander Meulen's : parentheses for chainlines that intersect watermarks, braces for deckle edges, double slashes for gaps in measurement, and square brackets for trimmed edges. Hailey makes fewer alterations to Vander Meulen's form of report, the chief one being to print in bold-face italics the figures for the space(s) where a watermark is located; and each of his chain-space measurements is an average of the measurements from several sheets, the result being a "composite chain- space model." (In using this approach, one must be careful not to obscure differences between paper stocks.) His method is set forth in detail on pp. 156–165 of "The Shakespearian Pavier Quartos Revisited" ( Stud- ies in Bibliography , 57 [for 2005–06 ; 2008 ], 151–195); he had previously described his approach less fully in "The Bibliographical Analysis of An- tique Laid Paper: A Method" (in Teaching Bibliography, Textual Criticism, and Book History , ed. Ann R. Hawkins [ 2006 ], pp. 149–154) and in "The Dating Game: New Evidence for the Dates of Q4 Romeo and Juliet and Q4 Hamlet " ( Shakespeare Quarterly , 58 [ 2007 ], 367–387 [see pp. 372–373, 376–377]). Vander Meulen's 1984 essay also discusses several other ways to iden- tify paper, none of which is covered in my essay. Their inclusion in a bibliographical description, however, is not necessarily required. The one most likely to qualify is a measurement of wireline density—expressed (as Vander Meulen suggests) in the number of wires per three centimeters. (A recent use of the three-centimeter measurement, reported to me by Vander Meulen , occurs in Agnieszka Helman-Ważny's The Archaeology of Tibetan Books [ 2014 ], as on pp. 35, 177, and 231–248.) Since paper can be identified by the chainline sequences alone, the addition of wireline density may not be of further help, though it can sometimes be useful in making tentative discriminations among paper varieties and in deter- mining which varieties come from the same pair of moulds. In any case, a thorough description is of course not limited to details necessary for identification, and the inclusion of wireline density obviously adds to the completeness of the description. Another identifying characteristic is the precise location of any tranchefiles (a tranchefile is an extra chain that sometimes occurs, at one or both ends of the mould, between the last regular chain and the frame of the mould); but since these lines would be part of the records of chain-space sequences (and recognized by the smaller intervals they usually create), they do not normally need separate attention. Still another feature of laid paper is the "shadow" centered on many chainlines, caused by the supporting wooden ribs under the chains (ex- cept for most tranchefiles). Sometimes, apparently when chains are not directly aligned over the ribs (as they normally are), there is an effect of double chainlines, one of which in each pair is less distinct than the other. Vander Meulen does not include these secondary chainlines in his chain- space sequences, nor does he report the location of shadows in relation to the secondary chainlines. Although the presence of these features should perhaps be mentioned in general terms in a bibliographical description, they do not usually call for detailed reporting. A further article of Vander Meulen's , published four years after this major one, should be mentioned here as a footnote to it: "The Low-Tech Analysis of Early Paper" ( Literary Research , 13 [ 1988 ], 89–94), which conveniently sums up the techniques for analyzing paper and the literary and historical uses to which such analysis can be put. Paul Needham has published an important series of essays on the history of paper and the analytical uses of paper evidence. Of these, the two that are perhaps most directly relevant to bibliographical descrip- tion are "The Paper Supply of the Gutenberg Bible" ( Papers of the Biblio- graphical Society of America , 79 [ 1985 ], 303–374) and " Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper" ( Studies in Bibliography , 47 [ 1994 ], 23—64). The former includes the following example of a form for record- ing a paper stock (p. 317), which is repeated with further explanation and commentary in the latter (pp. 32—33, and with the addition of the "a" and "b"): Royal: Bull's Head a. mR4 | 19 | 14 chains (ave. 42.1 mm) | 18 | (6+) b. mL4 (3+) | 21 | 14 chains (ave. 42.3 mm) | 18 | (1+) The heading shows the common name for the size of the sheet (Royal), along with a descriptive term for the type of watermark (Bull's Head), without further specification of the dimensions of either one. Needham feels that precise leaf measurements of handmade paper are not useful even for an example with surviving deckle edges, given the variations that would exist between measurements taken at different points and the dif- ficulty of estimating how much is inaccessible in the fold. As long as the approximate nature of such measurements is clear, however, there is no harm in providing them as evidence for the extrapolation to the named size. The "a" and "b" lines in the description refer to the twin moulds of the particular paper stock; and "mR" and "mL" give the location of the watermark as being in the right or left half of each mould, with the at- tached number indicating which chain-space it is in (here, the fourth from the nearest short edge). For "right" and "left" to be meaningful, of course, the paper must be consistently viewed from the same side and with the watermark image upright. Needham recommends looking at the mould side; and if in certain instances the felt side seems more appropriate, the designation "(f.s.)" can be added. When a watermark design has no obvi- ous top or bottom, the position of some arbitrary feature can sometimes be used and noted (though totally symmetrical abstract designs defeat the system altogether). The remainder of each "a" and "b" line gives, at each end in paren- theses, the distance from the deckle edge to the tranchefile; then, moving in from each end, the number between the vertical rules is the measure- ment from the tranchefile to the nearest regular chain; and finally, in the center, is the number of chainlines with the average distance be- tween them. (One possible ambiguity—whether or not the stated num-ber of chains includes the two apparently represented by the second and third vertical lines—could be avoided if reference were made to "chain spaces" and not to "chains.") Needham acknowledges that this statement of chainline numbers is "a very crude 'measurement,'" but he believes it is usually sufficient for paper-stock identification when used in conjunc- tion with the other details. He recognizes, however, that noting the size of every chainline interval, as suggested by Vander Meulen (see above), may sometimes be needed, especially in connection with unwatermarked paper. The tabular form of Needham's presentation is obviously not es- sential: his notation can be made to fit within the general scheme I sug- gested at the end of my essay. One notices that Needham's description does not include an indi- cation (using Stevenson's system or any other) of the exact position of a watermark in relation to the adjacent chainlines. The reason is that Needham feels the information conveyed by such measurements is "so inferior to that supplied by actual-size reproductions" that he can- not regard them as "a fundamental element of paperstock description" (p. 34)—though he notes that they can indeed be helpful, as Vander Meulen has shown. In any case, reproductions cannot always be sup- plied; and, even when they are, some bibliographers will feel that they should be supplemented by measurements. But it is true, of course, that reproductions will always provide details not covered by verbal accounts. Needham's essay on Stevenson includes other criticisms, but they are subordinate to the admiration expressed for Stevenson's overall achieve- ment. Reading Needham's assessment of Stevenson should be an impor- tant part of any bibliographer's preparation for thinking about paper. Several other essays of his also make basic contributions to this process: "Res papirea: Sizes and Formats of the Late Medieval Book," in Ration- alisierung der Buchherstellung im Mittelalter und in der frühen Neuzeit , ed. Pe- ter Rück and Martin Boghardt ( 1994 ), pp. 123–145; "Concepts of Paper Study," in Puzzles in Paper: Concepts in Historical Watermarks , ed. Daniel W. Mosser , Michael Saffle , and Ernest W. Sullivan II ( 2000 ), pp. 1–36; and his superb survey "The Paper of English Incunabula," in Catalogue of Books Printed in the XVth Century Now in the British Library , ed. Lotte Hel- linga ( 2007 ), pp. 311–334. B. J. McMullin's articles of 2003–04 , 2004, and 2008 (cited above, under "Format") are basic for the study of handmade wove paper in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and machine-made paper in the first half of the nineteenth century. They provide historical background and explain some analytical techniques applicable to those papers. In addition to outlining clues regarding format (see "Format" above), he shows (in the 2008 paper) how seam marks in machine-made paper can be used for dating (paper with seam marks is probably between 1810 and 1850 ) and for identifying cancels and other irregularities in the makeup of a gathering (signaled by any breaking of a seam-mark pat- tern). An unanswered historical question that hampers some analysis is whether the printer gathered and collated sheets before sending them to the binder or whether, in the era of publishers' bindings, the binder took on this job; if the latter, random combinations of part-sheets in finished books might be more likely, thus rendering more doubtful the determina- tion of the particular imposition used. The point most relevant to writing a bibliographical description is his suggestion of two alternative plans for recording seam marks (pp. 78–79): seam marks horizontal: B1 2 7 8 F3 4 5 6 H3 4 5 6 M1 2 7 8 seam marks vertical: C5 8 G6 7 K6 7 N5 8 R1 4 U2 3 Z2 3 seam marks horizontal: $1 2 7 8 BM, $3 4 5 6 FH seam marks vertical: $1 4 R, $2 3 UZ, $5 8 CN, $6 7 GK As he points out, however, the pattern will not necessarily be the same in every copy of the edition; and if one therefore inserts library sigla (or copy numbers) in parentheses to identify individual copies, he feels that the first system would probably be clearer—though I believe that the preferable one might vary in different situations, since each has a different focus. In any case, they are both usable; and, though other schemes could be devised (especially to give more information about the exact positioning of the seam marks), there would seem to be no reason in most instances to do so. I do, however, think there is reason to question the point McMullin makes next: that "one might well allow the record to stand unqualified [with copy sigla], to be understood as indicating that a seam mark of a particular orientation is to be found in the specified gathering in at least one copy from within the edition." One could, of course, adopt an ab- breviated form of paper description and omit the locations of seam marks entirely (saying simply "machine-made paper with seam marks"); but if one is going to specify a sample location, the copy (or copies) used to obtain that information should be specified. The situation is analogous to the recording of locations of other features that vary from copy to copy. In the case of handmade paper, for example, all the sheets of a book may have the same watermark and countermark, but those marks may not appear on the same leaves in every copy, depending on how the paper was turned before printing and how the printing and handling of half- sheet gatherings were carried out; furthermore, the small variations in the papers coming from twin moulds (variation in watermark placement and in chainline and tranchefile spacing) may not be identically distributed in every copy. In all such cases, therefore, one ought to cite not only signa- ture locations but also the specific copies used—and normally to do so in the basic description, rather than including the information in the list of copies examined (see "Arrangement" below), since what is being recorded is a feature of the edition as published, not a post-publication alteration. A justifiable exception to this last recommendation, however, can be illus- trated by Stanley Boorman's bibliography of Ottaviano Petrucci ( 2006 ), where he (remarkably) records the locations of watermarks throughout each copy examined (that is, not simply sample locations); this information (along with his thorough notes on other variable features, such as in-house corrections) is much more efficiently placed in the accounts of examined copies, which thus form the largest element in his descriptions. One other matter that McMullin has written about is the paper-quality mark—the symbol that may appear in the direction line on the first page of a gathering to identify the paper when two issues on different papers are produced. The presence of such marks should obviously be noted in the paragraph on paper in a description. An example of these marks is illustrated by McMullin in What Readers Should Ignore on the Printed Page ( 2014 ), p. 7; see also his "Paper-Quality Marks and the Oxford Bible Press, 1682–1717 ," The Library , 6th ser., 6 ( 1984 ), 39–49, and " Cowper's Complete Poetical Works , 1837 (Russell, 166)," Script &amp; Print , 40 ( 2016 ), 45–54 (esp. pp. 51–53). John Bidwell's contributions deal primarily with the history of pa- permaking and thus provide useful background for descriptive bibliogra- phers, even if they are not always relevant to the practice of description. (For an excellent overview, see especially his "The Study of Paper as Evidence, Artefact, and Commodity," in The Book Encompassed , ed. Peter Davison [ 1992 ], pp. 69–82.) But descriptive bibliographers will be glad to find in his extraordinary American Paper Mills, 1690–1832 : A Directory of the Paper Trade, with Notes on Products, Watermarks, Distribution Methods, and Manufacturing Techniques (2013) a list of watermark attributions, citing each watermark and naming the mill that used it (pp. lxx–lxxiii). They will also be happy to find in "The Size of the Sheet in America : Paper Moulds Manufactured by N. &amp; D. Sellers of Philadelphia" ( Proceedings of the Ameri- can Antiquarian Society , 87 [ 1977 ], 299–342) a table headed "Some Names for Anglo-American Paper Sizes and Their Measurements." What makes this table more useful than others of its kind is that, for each of fifteen named sizes, the dimensions reported at nine specified times (from 1713 to 1952 ) are given. Bidwell's principal exercise in actual description of paper occurs in his Fine Papers at the Oxford University Press ( 1999 ), where (after an excel- lent historical account of the manufacture and sale of handmade paper) he provides fascinating commentaries on the forty specimens that are included in the book. Besides identifying these papers, he gives a concise description of each one, citing primarily the characteristics that the Press would have recorded in its ledgers (but recognizing that such descriptions did not have to be self-sufficient because papermakers would have been shown samples of what was desired). Each of his descriptions consists of seven elements: weight (per ream of 480 sheets), texture (laid or wove), dimensions, substance (grams per square meter), thickness (caliper mea- surements in thousandths of an inch), color, and watermark. Here is an example: "28–pound hand-made antique laid, 16¼ × 22½ ins: 106 gsm, caliper .005 in., cream, watermarked near each of the four corners: W [flower] M (felt side)" (p. 46). Clearly two of these features, weight and substance, could not be reported from direct observation in descriptions of books since they require loose sheets (though they might be provisionally noted from external sources); but the other five are part of the standard I sug- gested in 1971 , though presented differently. Bidwell recognizes that the thickness of a sheet of handmade paper is likely to vary from one part of the sheet to another, and thus the significance of the thickness figures he gives is not clear (a point made by David L. Vander Meulen in his review of this book in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 97 [ 2003 ], 589–595). In my 1971 essay I suggested that such figures should be expressed either as a range or as an average; I would now add that, in the latter case, the word "average" or the abbreviation "avg." should be appended to emphasize the status of the figure. (An article that may be regarded as a supplement to Bidwell , though published earlier, is John Purcell's "The Availability of Hand-Made, Mould-Made and Fine Ma- chine-Made Papers," Matrix , 3 [ 1983 ], 67–75, which includes a three- page table giving specifications for twenty-nine papers that were available at that time.) One of Bidwell's services to descriptive bibliographers is to have writ- ten a thorough review of Peter F. Tschudin's Grundzüge der Papiergeschichte ( 2002 ) for Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America (98 [ 2004 ], 105– 109). Because Tschudin recommends describing paper and watermarks in terms of the International Standard for the Registration of Paper with or without Watermarks (first proposed by the International Association of Pa- per Historians [IPH] in 1992 and last revised in 2013 [text available on the IPH website]), Bidwell had occasion to assess that system—a task that most bibliographers have not undertaken. The system is designed to produce machine-readable records, each of which has potentially a hun- dred fields, sometimes involving intricate coding. As an example, Bidwell notes that a watermark consisting of a crown over CLK in script would be reported as "R3/1—{b:(i:X"CLK")}"—and this is far from being one of the more complex possibilities. Although a large database constructed in this way could indeed be searched productively, the effort involved in writing such descriptions is a deterrent to their widespread use. Bidwell comes to the sensible conclusion that descriptive bibliographers may justi- fiably feel that their purposes are adequately served by readily understood verbal watermark descriptions (including, as Stevenson suggested, quasi- facsimile transcriptions). A more detailed criticism of the IPH system (referred to by Bidwell ) has been provided on the website produced at Bates College by Robert W. Allison and James A. Hart , "The WWW Watermark Archive Initiative," which is aimed at developing guidelines for online databases: see the sec- tion entitled "Commentary and Interpretation of the IPH Standard." In their comments on watermarks, they say, "Our objective is to use straight- forward standardized language and eliminate the codes." This website also contains links to several online databases of watermark images, such as the University of Delaware's " Thomas Gravell Watermark Collection," containing some 8500 records as of early 2015 ; and the IPH website lists more than a dozen such links. (See below for some further references to discussions of online databases.) The next year after my essay, Philip Gaskell (whose important earlier studies of paper are mentioned there) published A New Introduction to Bib- liography ( 1972 , 1974 ), which discusses the history and analysis of paper in two chapters. The one on paper in the hand-press period (pp. 57–77) has a page on description (pp. 76–77), and that on the machine-press period (pp. 214–230) has two pages (pp. 226–228). The former chapter includes the point, which cannot be stated too often, that handmade paper varies from sheet to sheet and that any edition may have been printed on two or more paper stocks, which may not be consistently represented in a given copy (emphasizing once again the necessity for examining a large number of copies). But the main contribution to paper description that Gaskell makes in this book has to do with machine-made paper. He enumerates five simple tests for distinguishing the characteristics of different stocks: (1) assess the feel (surface texture) and color in a good light; (2) identify, with a raking light, the belt side and notice the wove pattern; (3) measure the pattern (in wires per centimeter) and, if it is oblong or diamond-shaped (rather than square), notice whether its longer dimension is parallel to the grain (which is also the machine direction); (4) measure the thickness with a micrometer; and (5) establish the relative densities of papers in two books by weighing them (though it should be added that there are often too many variables here to make this test of much use). He then lists seven additional tests that, because they involve damaging the paper (by fold- ing or applying chemicals), would not normally be of use to descriptive bibliographers. Tables of standard paper sizes are given for the hand-press period (pp. 73–75; provided in my essay as well) and the machine-press period (p. 224). (A short list of handmade paper sizes also appears in J. D. Fleeman's bibliography of Samuel Johnson [ 2000 ], p. xxxvii.) Besides Gaskell , another summation of basic information about pa- per (far more extensive than Gaskell's ), incorporating original research and with fresh observations, is Neil Harris's Paper and Watermarks as Bib- liographical Evidence ( 2010 , 2017 , on the website of the Institut d'Histoire du Livre in Lyon ; a pdf of the second edition can be printed out as a document of 155 very full pages). It is a learned treatise on many aspects of paper study, presented in a "snappy" and "punchy" way (his words), with frequent jocular asides. (This style is not to everyone's taste, but the work does contain some memorable sentences.) The most relevant parts for descriptive bibliographers are embedded in the fourth and fifth chapters: "The Shape of Paper" (pdf pp. 32–44), which deals with size and format; and "Dillying and Dallying with Watermarks" (pp. 45–59), which includes comments on describing, reproducing, and classifying watermarks. Bibliographers who have occasion to consult published col- lections of watermark designs will benefit from the fascinating chapter on Briquet (pp. 60–75), which takes up his life, methods, and followers, as well as how to employ his great work. In using any of Harris's discussions, one would be well advised to read, at the same time, the corresponding sections of his impressive seventy-page analytical record of the interna- tional literature, full of references not easily found elsewhere and advice not available anywhere else—see especially sections 7–23 (pp. 112–131, on size, format, and watermark description and reproduction), 30–31 (pp. 136–144, on analytical bibliography and watermark collections), and 35 (pp. 150–152, on websites). What may be regarded as a supplement to Gaskell's and McMul- lin's work on nineteenth-century paper is Chris Elmore's "Describing Nineteenth-Century Papers" ( Script &amp; Print , 40 [ 2016 ], 5–28), though its emphasis is on writing papers rather than printing papers (it should certainly be consulted by those dealing with handwritten letters and journals). Of the points relevant to bibliographers of printed books, two are worth repeating here, even though they are obvious to anyone who understands that paper made with the Fourdrinier machine has a wove pattern, imparted by the moving woven-wire belt on which the pulp is placed, and that any chainlines or watermarks result from the action of a dandy roll pressing into the other side of the pulp. Knowing this process, one can tell whether paper with a laid pattern is machine-made by noting whether it has a wove pattern as well as a laid pattern—the former of course indented into one side of the paper, and the latter indented into the other. (The indentations from the wove belt were deeper and closer together than those resulting from hand-held moulds, but this point, being comparative, is difficult to make use of.) Second, machine-made watermarked paper (even without laid lines) can naturally be detected by the presence of the watermark indentations on the opposite side from the wove-pattern indentations; but one can also note that the indenta- tions of the lines of the watermark design (and lettering, if any) are inter- sected by the indentations of the wove pattern from the belt—whereas in handmade wove paper the watermark, being on top of the wire mesh, covers the mesh pattern at the points of contact. (One must recognize that these facts about paper made with the Fourdrinier machine do not apply to so-called mechanical mould-made paper, in which a rotating cylinder mould deposits each sheet on a moving woolen felt, and in which all patterns and watermarks are therefore indented from the same side; another difference between such paper and Fourdrinier paper is that its fibers are distributed randomly in the sheet rather than solely in the belt direction.) Employing contemporary paper-trade sources, Elmore says that "laid" and "wove" were the standard nineteenth-century terms for printing papers. As for dimensions, he gives tables of writing-paper sizes (and size names), but he does not add anything to Gaskell's table of ma- chine-made paper sizes. Although he suggests that bibliographers might use some of the trade terms for other characteristics (such as finish, bulk, and opacity), he also indicates that they were somewhat impressionistic, reflecting the judgment of professionals who handled paper every day, and that they should therefore be used with caution—or, I would add, probably not be used at all (or only as ordinary adjectives, not as techni- cal terms). Among the many other post- 1971 publications on the history and analysis of paper, several may be mentioned as particularly useful for descriptive bibliographers (and see the references in "Format" above). Published collections of watermark reproductions have improved since 1971 as a result of the use of beta-radiography and several photographic and digital processes. ( See David E. Schoonover , "Techniques of Repro- ducing Watermarks: A Practical Introduction," in Essays in Paper Analysis , ed. Stephen Spector [ 1987 ], pp. 154–167; A. de la Chapelle, C. Monbeig- Goguelle , and A. Prat , "Les filigranes des dessins anciens et les relèves betaradiographiques," Annals of Radiology , 37 [ 1994 ], 249–258; David L. Gants , "The Application of Digital Image Processing to the Analysis of Watermarked Paper and Printers' Ornament Usage in Early Printed Books," in New Ways of Looking at Old Texts, II , ed. W. Speed Hill [ 1998 ], pp. 133–147; and Neil Harris , Paper and Watermarks as Bibliographical Evi- dence [ 2017 ], pp. 54–57, 128–131.) For example, there are Thomas L. Gravell and George Miller's two volumes ( A Catalogue of American Water- marks , 1690–1835 [ 1979 ; rev. with Elizabeth Walsh, 2002 ] and A Catalogue of Foreign Watermarks Found on Paper Used in America , 1700–1835 [ 1983 ]); see the related article by Daniel W. Mosser and Ernest Sullivan II, "The Thomas L. Gravell Watermark Archive on the Internet," in Puzzles in Paper: Concepts in Historical Watermarks , ed. Mosser, Sullivan , and Michael Saffle ( 2000 ), pp. 211–228. A notable publication by a great cartographic scholar, David Woodward , is his Catalogue of Watermarks in Italian Printed Maps ca. 1540–1600 ( 1996 ). A number of collections of watermarks are now available online, and two websites that conveniently provide links to many of them are those of the International Association of Paper Histo- rians and of the "Bernstein: The Memory of Paper" consortium; see also Harris (cited three sentences earlier), pp. 150–152. The two anthologies just cited, Spector ( 1987 ) and Mosser ( 2000 ), in- clude a number of other pieces relevant to the description and recording of watermarks. The Spector contains Phillip Pulsiano's extremely use- ful list, "A Checklist of Books and Articles Containing Reproductions of Watermarks" (pp. 115–153). The Mosser presents three articles on watermark reproduction: Carol Ann Small's "Phosphorescence Water- mark Imaging" (pp. 169–181), Rolf Dessauer's "DYLUX, Thomas L. Gravell , and Watermarks of Stamps and Papers" (pp. 183–185), and Dan- iela Moschini's "La Marca d'Acqua: A System for the Digital Recording of Watermarks" (trans. Conor Fahy ; pp. 187–192). Also in the Mosser is Robert W. Allison's "An Automated World Wide Web Search Tool for Papers and Watermarks: The Archive of Papers and Watermarks in Greek Manuscripts" (pp. 201–210), which describes the Bates College archive mentioned above; and Ted-Larry Pebworth's "Towards a Tax- onomy of Watermarks" (pp. 239–242), which offers a computer-oriented system based on a "flexible grid pattern" for describing locations of parts of watermarks. A third anthology, Looking at Paper: Evidence &amp; Interpretation , ed. John Slavin et al. ( 2001 ), emphasizes paper in prints, drawings, and manuscripts and has less of relevance for descriptive bibliography; but it does include Ruby Reid Thompson's "Historical and Literary Papers and the Applica- tion of Watermark Descriptions" (pp. 142–153), which makes use of the Nottingham University Library Watermark Database, and Ian Christie- Miller's "Digital Imaging" (pp. 139–141), on the "Bookmark" reflected- light system. A later article on Christie-Miller's approach is his "New Tools for Old Paper" ( The Book Collector , 58 [ 2009 ], 383–389), which describes his Advanced Paper Imaging System, using both frontlighting and backlighting and showing conjugate leaves together. The equipment that Christie-Miller has devised is illustrated on his website (www.early-paper.com); the battery-powered one-millimeter-thick electroluminescent source for viewing paper structure and watermarks, which is a part of his system, has been marketed as "Pocket Viewlight" by Howard Eaton Lighting Ltd. The series of articles reporting on the use of the Davis (California ) cyclotron to analyze the makeup of paper and ink is most conveniently represented by Richard N. Schwab, Thomas A. Cahill, Bruce H. Kusko , and Daniel L. Wick's "Cyclotron Analysis of the Ink [and paper] in the 42–Line Bible," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 77 ( 1983 ), 285–315. Two good general articles on the usefulness of water- mark evidence, both published in 1978 , are Bruno Scarfe's "A Role for Watermarks in Bibliographical Description, with Special Reference to a Collection of Spanish Dramatic Items," Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 12: 85–101; and Stephen Spector's "Symmetry in Watermark Sequences," Studies in Bibliography , 31: 162–178. Further references can be found in my Introduction to Bibliography ( 2002 revision), part 5, pp. 181–193, and sections 9D5, 9F2, 9G5, and 9H4 (pp. 205–207, 290–291, 307–309, and 314). To summarize: the main points to be added to my 1971 recommenda- tions are that one would be well advised to record the sequence of chain- line intervals in a stock of paper; that any indication of the location of a watermark should specify which half of the sheet it is in; that any citation of a given leaf as a source of evidence should indicate the particular copy of the book used; and that specifications of thickness of handmade paper should note that the figure is an average. These additions will make the treatment of paper both more comprehensive and more precise. TYPOGRAPHY AND LAYOUT I published "The Identification of Type Faces in Bibliographical Description" in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 60 ( 1966 ), 185–202, and reprinted it (with a "Postscript") in Journal of Typographic Research , 1 ( 1967 ), 427–447; it was reprinted in a French translation in Arts et techniques graphiques , 86 (septembre-octobre 1972 ), 41–55. My sug- gestions for classifying or naming a type design (on various levels of speci- ficity) and for measuring type faces (not type bodies) were followed by an example of how one might report features of layout such as the size of the type-page and the typography of running titles and headings. The idea of measuring faces rather than bodies has been advocated even in a professional printing journal: Eugene M. Ettenberg , writing in Inland Printer/American Lithographer for January 1969 (162.4) on the possibility of switching to metric measurements, said, "it is to be hoped that a newer method for designating type size, should it come, would not repeat the mistake with which we have lived so long, that of making the type size the size of body. Type should truly be graded by its optical size rather than by its metal size" (p. 48). In supplementing my essay half a century later, I wish to call attention first to Harry Carter's A View of Early Typography up to about 1600 ( 1969 ; reprinted in 2002 with an introduction by James Mosley )-not only be- cause Carter is always worth reading but also because he takes Bowers as a starting point. His aim is to show how, given present knowledge of typographic history, one can respond to Bowers's doubts about how far a bibliographer can go in identifying a type face. At the outset, he says that a face is "sufficiently identified" by the name of the punch-cutter (that is, the design), the body size, and the "style" as described by standard adjectives. The second chapter opens with this passage (which includes a comment on measuring faces that could be extended to later periods): Why should it be so difficult to do what Professor Professor Bowers thought would be de- sirable, if it were possible: to particularize the type used in a book? If you measure it, and find that 20 lines set in it take up, say, 85 mm., you restrict it to a class of a particular body—a property of a type-founder's mould. It remains to describe the face, which might be cast on a variety of bodies. I had rather name typefaces for size by the conventional body that would best fit them, Pica, Long Primer, Minion, and such, than by numbers, qualifying these terms if necessary by adding "large" or "small". Some time in the early part or the middle of the sixteenth century these names acquired fixed meanings. Until it becomes appropriate to use them it is safest to measure the face of a fount, which you can do if you have a powerful magnifying- glass and a fine scale and measure from the top of b to the bottom of p or the extent of an Italic f . This, called the gauge of the face, cannot vary. (p. 23) Carter proceeds to discuss the value of naming the designer-cutter (which sums up "all manner of information as to place and time, circumstances and relationships"), and he notes the inadequacy of the usual terms of classification. "It is evident," he says (and bibliographers should take note), "that in considering the face of a fount of type we are in a world of art, styles, difficulty of saying what styles, inherited forms, human hands" (p. 24). But although he concludes that this "humble art" is not "suscep- tible of scientific treatment," he clearly believes that rigorous historical description is possible. The next book that should be mentioned, because of its prominence, is Philip Gaskell's A New Introduction to Bibliography ( 1972 , 1974 ), though unfortunately its section called "Type Sizes; and Description" (pp. 12- 16) makes recommendations that raise some questions. To begin with, Gaskell says that a twenty-line measurement (from the top of an ascender in one line to the same point in the twenty-first line below) gives one (after division by twenty) the "apparent body-size," though he adds, "It is important to make sure that the lines measured are set solid." He says that if the vertical gap between the bottom of a descender in one line and the top of an ascender in the next line is half a millimeter or less, the lines are "probably" set solid; but if the space is greater, the lines are "either leaded or printed from a fount cast on an oversize body." How, then, has the body size been made "apparent"? This is precisely the dif- ficulty that caused me to recommend not referring to the body size but focusing instead on what is actually visible, and I continue to believe that my suggestion is sound (giving the vertical size and the x-height of the face combined with a multiple-line measurement). The specific number of lines to be measured is a less important matter, and Gaskell's choice of twenty is traditional; but he should at least have indicated that a twenty— line measurement is not the only responsible possibility, since the greater convenience of ten (which I pointed out) was recognized as long ago as McKerrow's time (p. 306 of his 1927 Introduction ), and later by Allan Stevenson in his 1961 volume of the Hunt catalogue (p. clxxxii). Another problem with Gaskell's discussion is the form of report he stipulates. Af- ter the vertical dimension of the face is measured, he says, "the x-height and the capital height are measured in millimetres and the result is pre— sented in the form: '[face height X 20] X [x-height] : [capital height]'"; his example is "Body 82. Face 80 X 1.7 : 2.5." Although this system is "adapted" from one "introduced" by H. D. L. Vervliet in The Type Speci- men of the Vatican Press 1628 ( 1967 ), it is not in any sense an established standard. He should have made clear that he is simply recommending this form but that other plans are plausible; it is regrettable that his prescrip— tive assertion ("the result is presented in the form …") will mislead the very people that such an introduction is meant to instruct. Gaskell's treatment does, however, make two points that usefully sup- plement my discussion. First, he notes how measurements are complicated by paper shrinkage and ink seepage. His guideline is that shrinkage (as the dampened paper dried after printing) reduced the type-face dimensions "by about 1 per cent, and occasionally by as much as 2½ percent." One must certainly keep this point in mind; all one can do is to take multiple measurements in different copies and caution the reader about the prob- lem in an introduction. As for the ink spread that occurs when the type sinks into the paper, one must be sure to measure (using magnification) only the indented impression, not the total ink smear. This point was ef- fectively made in 1988 by Adrian Weiss in explaining why photographic reproductions are not useful for making type measurements ("Reproduc- tions of Early Dramatic Texts as a Source of Bibliographical Evidence," Text , 4: 237–268). (Cf. Joseph A. Dane's discussion of reproductions and shrinkage in relation to type measurement in The Myth of Print Culture [ 2003 ], pp. 75–82.) The other helpful point in Gaskell's discussion is that the height of a capital should be given as well as the total height (ascender to descender) and the x-height. David L. Vander Meulen , in his Dunciad bibliography ( 1981 dissertation), explains the value of all three measure- ments for revealing the proportions of a design, and he suggests simply giving the three figures (measured to the nearest third of a millimeter) with virgules separating them (e.g., "face 4.0/2.7/1.7"). There are two other matters that I wish to add to what I wrote in 1966 . First, the indication of the number of lines on a typical page is meaningful only for books of prose or long narrative poems. For books of short poems, where few (if any) pages have text extending down to the point where the last line would occur—and where even those pages may have stanza breaks of more than a single line space—the bibliographer will have to depart from the formulaic statement I suggested and explain precisely what the situation is (indicating, for example, the amount of space between stanzas, altering the multi-line measurement to something smaller than ten lines if all the stanzas in the book are shorter than that, and noting whether each poem begins on a new page). The second matter is that there may be times, especially in the hand- press period, when it would not be objectionable to give the type-body size as well as the type-face size. When the multi-line measurement comes close to what it would be at a specific time for a particular standard type (pica, long primer, etc.) if set solid (always allowing for paper shrinkage), one may be justified in concluding that this type was the one used. Gaskell provides a table (p. 15) giving the names of the nine most common body sizes in the hand-press period and the twenty-line measurements of each at varying times. (Carter gives a similar list of twelve sizes on p. 127; and J. D. Fleeman gives a list of thirteen sizes, important for not being based on multi-line measurements but rather on such combinations as "ly", in his Samuel Johnson bibliography [ 2000 ], p. xxxvii.) A much more com- prehensive table was published by John Richardson , Jr., in "Correlated Type Sizes and Names for the Fifteenth through Twentieth Century" ( Studies in Bibliography , 43 [ 1990 ], 251–272). This fourteen-page table re- cords twenty-line measurements in millimeters, inches, and points (pica, fournier, and didot), along with the type names in seven countries. Al- though he is careful to measure the type impressions under magnification and recognizes the problem of paper shrinkage, one may still feel that some of his measurements are unrealistically precise. Indeed, this table has been severely criticized by James Mosley (in "Type Bodies Compared," Journal of the Printing Historical Society , n.s., 23 [ 2015 ], 49–58) for "indiscriminately" bringing together measurements from "sources that are unevenly reliable" (p. 56); he regards it as a "useful reminder of the problems involved"—problems that to some extent affect the other published tables as well. Mosley's main point is that size names varied in the sizes they signified in different geographical locations and at different times. He provides a pioneering table (pp. 50–51) indicating the various sizes (measured to hundredths of a millimeter) that certain names could refer to in ten specimens from about 1585 to 1768 . Although one can use the earlier tables for giving a general sense of relative sizes, Mosley has made it clear that one must be aware of local traditions at different times. Furthermore, anyone concerned with measuring type and naming the body sizes in pre-eighteenth-century books should read two detailed reviews of W. Craig Ferguson's Pica Roman Type in Elizabethan England ( 1989 ): one by Adrian Weiss in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 83 ( 1989 ), 539–546; the other by John A. Lane in The Library , 6th ser., 14 ( 1992 ), 357–365. Ferguson's book, which is intended to help date books and identify their printers, uses a brief checklist of features for identifying types, but they are not adequate for determining the specific type stock owned by a given printer (see the comments on font analysis below). In my account of levels of specificity for identifying type faces, the highest one involves recourse to specimen books, and there is one bibli- ography that can be singled out for its excellence in performing this task for post-Renaissance books. David Gilson's Jane Austen ( 1982 ) includes type descriptions supplied by Nicolas Barker in the following form (this one for Northanger Abbey and Persuasion , 1818 ): Printing: type: Vols.1 and 2 were printed by Roworth, Vols.3 and 4 by Davison. In Vol.1 the 'Biographical notice' is set in Caslon Small Pica, the 'Small Pica No.2' from the Caslon and Catherwood specimen in Stower's Printer's grammar 1808 , with figures from 'Small Pica No.1'; the 'Advertisement' is in a Caslon Pica roman, identical with the 'Pica No.1' in Caslon and Catherwood's 1819 Specimen , apart from some letters which are of a different cut, perhaps slightly earlier. The text of Vols.1 and 2 is set in Caslon Pica roman, the first in the Stower Caslon and Catherwood specimen. The text of Vols.3 and 4 is set in a Caslon Pica roman, between the second pica roman shown in the Stower Caslon and Catherwood specimen, and 'Pica No.4' in Caslon and Catherwood's 1821 Specimen. … (p. 81) Barker also contributed "A Note on the Typographical Identifications" (pp. xi-xiv), which is worth reading for its comments on the difficulties of using typefounders' specimens and the particular problems associated with the 1780–1830 period. He notes that the work requires "an eye ac- customed to the minute details that distinguish the cut of one letter from its equivalent in another fount." This point illustrates why Gilson was wise to turn to a specialist—and suggests that other bibliographers might do the same. For classifying type faces into broad categories, my suggestion of the DIN system (the initials standing for Deutsches Institut für Normung since 1975 ), as presented by James Mosley in 1960 , remains appropriate in my view—especially the terms "Renaissance," "Baroque," and "Neo- Classic," which also appear in Gaskell's adaptation of the DIN plan in his New Introduction (p. 16). Robert Bringhurst, known for his thoughtful discussion of typographic matters, has provided one of the best statements of the reasons to use such historically allusive terms. In his often reprinted The Elements of Typographic Style ( 1992 ), after mentioning research on "sci- entific descriptions," he says: But letterforms are not only objects of science. They also belong to the realm of art, and they participate in its history. They have changed over time just as music, painting and architecture have changed, and the same historical terms—Renais- sance, Baroque, Neoclassical, Romantic, and so on—are useful in each of these fields. … Typography never occurs in isolation. Good typography demands not only a knowledge of type itself, but an understanding of the relationship between letterforms and the other things that humans make and do. (p. 111) He then presents a historical classification using these headings: Re- naissance, Mannerist, Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassical, Romantic, Real- ist, Geometrical modernism, Lyrical modernism, and Postmodern (pp. 111–123). There will never be an end, however, to the construction of clas- sification systems, and many other discussions of the subject have been published since 1966. Most of Alexander Lawson's Printing Types: An Intro- duction ( 1971 , 1990 ), for example, is devoted to classification. After a brief summary of four systems (Vox, Association Typographique Internation- ale, British Standards Institution [BSI], and DIN), he offers "An Attempt to Formulate a Rational System" (pp. 45–119); although it is useful for its numerous examples of designs and its historical discussion of each, the system itself uses the traditional "old style," "transitional," and "modern," which are widely thought to be inadequate. Bringhurst himself offered a "scientific" approach in "On the Classification of Letterforms" ( Serif , 1 [Fall 1994 ], 30–39); it amounts to an extensive analogy with biological classification (using such terms as phylum, class, order, family, genus , and species ) and seems unlikely to become widely employed. (His discussions of some individual period styles followed in the next several issues of Serif .) Lesser examples are J. Ben Lieberman's Types of Typefaces and How to Recognize Them [ 1967 ] and Gordon Atkins's The Classification of Printing Types [ 1975 ]. Among the helpful treatments of earlier systems are Walter Tracy's "Type Design Classification," Visible Language , 5 ( 1971 ), 59–66 (on Vox, BSI, and DIN); John Dreyfus's "The Typographical Importance of Maximilien Vox ," Matrix , 17 ( 1997 ), 1–11; and Craig Eliason's "A His- tory of the 'Humanist' Type Classification," Printing History , n.s., 18 (July 2015 ), 3–26. A criticism of the DIN system is Gerrit Noordzij's "Broken Scripts and the Classification of Typefaces," Journal of Typographic Re- search , 4 ( 1970 ), 213–240. In connection with naming specific type designs, my 1966 essay noted several listings of specimen books and several anthologies of type faces; some of the most important works in both categories have been published since that time. As for lists of specimens, there are Maurice Annenberg's Type Foundries of America and Their Catalogs ( 1975 , 1994 ) and James Mos- ley's British Type Specimens before 1831 : A Handlist ( 1984 ). Mosley also edited facsimiles of the 1766 Caslon specimen ( 1983 ) and the 1796 Stephenson specimen ( 1990 ), and John A. Lane edited facsimiles of the 1768 and 1773 Enschedé specimens ( 1993 ). In the category of anthologies of faces, the two outstanding ones are Rookledge's International Type-Finder by Christo- pher Perfect and Gordon Rookledge ( 1983 ) and A Manual of Comparative Typography: The PANOSE System by Benjamin Bauermeister ( 1988 ). Both are very helpful, with their cross-reference charts and "earmark" tables, but the PANOSE system is more complicated to use and the book displays many fewer faces. Another worthy work is Albert Kapr's The Art of Lette- ring (trans. 1983 ), which shows a large number of "typefaces of the present" (and includes a brief comparative discussion of classification schemes). A few other examples are James Sutton and Alan Bartram's An Atlas of Type- forms ( 1968 , 1988 ) and Typefaces for Books ( 1990 ), Mac McGrew's American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century ( 1986 , 1993 ), Centennial's Typeidenti- fier ( 1986 , with its "Typographical Sleuthing" sections), Lawrence W. Wal- lis's Modern Encyclopedia of Typefaces, 1960–1990 ( 1990 ), Michael Mitchell and Susan Wightman's Book Typography: A Designer's Manual ( 2005 ), and Alan Bartram's Typeforms: A History ( 2007 ). Descriptive bibliographers need a vocabulary for talking about type designs (in addition to classifying and naming them), and my 1966 com- ments (which deal primarily with weight and width) should now be supplemented with Philip Gaskell's excellent "A Nomenclature for the Letter-Forms of Roman Type" (The Library , 5th ser., 29 [ 1974 ], 42–51). Other glossaries are Type Evidence: A Thesaurus for Use in Rare Book and Special Collections Cataloging (Association of College and Research Librar- ies, 1990 ); Robert Bringhurst's "Sorts &amp; Characters" and "Glossary of Terms" in his The Elements of Typographic Style ( 1992 ), pp. 214–240; and Theodore Rosendorf's The Typographic Desk Reference ( 2009 , 2016 ). (See also S. J. M. Watson , "Three Notes on Nomenclature," Printing Historical Society Bulletin , 46 [Winter 1998–99 ], 9–10.) The nomenclature and clas- sification of printers' ornaments are taken up by Roger Burford Mason in "A Note on Type Ornaments, Borders and Flowers" ( Albion , 20 [Sum- mer 1983 ], 5–9), and by Jim Mitchell in "The Taxonomy of Printers' Ornaments" ( Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 9 [ 1985 ], 45–60). Near the end of my essay, I mentioned the possibility of identifying the individual font owned by a particular printer—that is, the specific col- lection of types in a given printer's set of cases, recognizable through its idiosyncrasies, such as damaged and wrong-font types. Although Charl- ton Hinman in 1963 did some work of this kind (in The Printing and Proof- Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare ), it was Adrian Weiss who showed in detail how to pursue such analysis and use it to identify printers— in several brilliant articles: "Font Analysis as a Bibliographical Method: The Elizabethan Play-Quarto Printers and Compositors," Studies in Bib- liography , 43 ( 1990 ), 95–164; "Bibliographical Methods for Identifying Unknown Printers in Elizabethan/Jacobean Books," Studies in Bibliogra- phy , 44 ( 1991 ), 183–228; and "Shared Printing, Printer's Copy, and the Text(s) of Gascoigne's A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres," Studies in Bibliography , 45 ( 1992 ), 71–104. Another sophisticated approach to type analysis, not mentioned in my 1966 essay (because it had not yet been undertaken), involves computer assistance. Nicolas Barker , in his chapter of The Book Encompassed ("Typo- graphic Studies"), ed. Peter Davison ( 1992 ), quotes from two 1982 articles by the digital-type designer Charles A. Bigelow as a basis for suggesting the adaptation of computer type-designing techniques to the historical analysis of type faces (pp. 96–98). In 2003 , two projects employing digital enlargements of type faces were the subjects of published reports. Kay Amert explained a system for superimposing two images, one made up of horizontal and the other of vertical screened lines (or of two tints) in order to reveal minute differences in type-face shapes ("Digital Com- parison of Letterforms," Printing History , 46: 21–35). The other report, by Blaise Agüera y Arcos, described the work he and Paul Needham had done with computer enlargements of Gutenberg's type faces, reveal- ing that variations were present among the types for any given letter and suggesting that Gutenberg's early types were made in nonreusable moulds ("Temporary Matrices and Elemental Punches in Gutenberg's DK Type," in Incunabula and Their Readers: Printing, Selling and Using Books in the Fifteenth Century , ed. Kristian Jensen [ 2003 ], pp. 1–12). There are also digital atlases of type faces in progress (see, for example, Heiner Klocke , "The Software Architecture of the Hebrew Type Digital Image Atlas," in Hebrew Typography in German-Speaking Regions: An Interim Report , ed. Klocke and Itari Joseph Tamari [ 2001 ], pp. 63–70). But at present most collections of type designs on the internet are commercially oriented and require searching by the name of the design, though "Identifont" and "Fonts.com" do allow for identifying certain digital fonts by answering several questions about their appearance. Although the analysis of ink, beyond naming its color, is not likely to be undertaken for most descriptive bibliographies, the composition of ink can be revealed by cyclotron analysis in the same operation that discloses the makeup of paper (as mentioned above under "Paper"). An extensive checklist of material on "Typography, Ink, and Book Design" appears in my Introduction to Bibliography ( 2002 revision), part 6, pp. 195–224—which includes, in sections A-E (pp. 195–204), additional publications related to the identification and classification of type faces. See also the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature ( 1969–74 ), in which the relevant sections are by Nicolas Barker , Terry Belanger , Graham Pollard , James Mosley , and Peter Davison . In preparing oneself to describe type designs and layout, one must always keep in mind that these are art forms. TYPESETTING AND PRESSWORK In "The Treatment of Typesetting and Presswork in Bibliographical Description," Studies in Bibliography , 52 (for 1999 ; 2000 ), 1–57, I discussed how some of the results of bibliographical analysis might be incorporated into a descriptive bibliography. Analysis, of course, underlies all aspects of a description, but I was dealing here only with the kinds of analysis that would be reported in a paragraph on typesetting and presswork. I have nothing to add to my proposals there, but I do wish to emphasize again the importance of including this kind of information in a descrip- tive bibliography, as demonstrated long ago in David L. Vander Meulen's bibliography of Pope's Dunciad ( 1981 dissertation). (A few examples of analysis that might appear in paragraphs other than the one on typeset- ting and presswork: the analysis of format is generally reported in the col- lation line; the identification of printers in the many instances of false or incomplete imprints, based on the analysis of type-case contents or print- ers' ornaments, could well be mentioned in connection with title-page transcription; and the distinguishing of impressions, which may require a number of analytical techniques, obviously affects the whole structure of a description.) The most comprehensive discussion of bibliographical analysis since my 1999 essay is my Bibliographical Analysis: A Historical Introduction ( 2009 ), based on my Sandars Lectures (mentioned as unpublished in note 3 of that essay). The second chapter, "Analysis of Manufacturing Clues" (pp. 31– 60, with notes on pp. 97–108), does not deal with the formal presenta- tion of bibliographical evidence but in other respects covers much the same ground as the 1999 essay, summarizing the uses of each technique of analysis (it also supplements the earlier piece with references to later work). (For the analysis of paper, discussed in the book but not in the 1999 essay, see "Paper" above.) The book includes in its "Subject Guide" a listing of the main writings on each analytical technique, useful for its selectivity; many additional writings, but only through 2002 , are recorded in my Introduction to Bibliography ( 2002 revision), part 9, pp. 255–365. I wish to call particular attention to three other post- 1999 publica- tions. They are outstanding examples of the application of analytical tech- niques to particular editions; and although they were not intended to be general introductions to the subject, they serve that purpose admirably (at least for the pre- 1700 period): Randall McLeod , "Chronicling Holin- shed's Chronicles: Textual Commentary," in The Peaceable and Prosperous Regiment of Blessed Queene Elizabeth: A Facsimile from Holinshed's "Chronicles" ( 1587 ) , ed. Cyndia Susan Clegg ( 2005 ), pp. 19–76; Adrian Weiss , "Casting Compositors, Foul Cases, and Skeletons: Printing in Middleton's Age," in Thomas Middleton and Early Modern Textual Culture: A Companion to the Col- lected Works , ed. Gary Taylor and John Lavagnino ( 2007 ), pp. 195–225 (cf. "Running-Title Movements and Printing Method," pp. 484–485); and Paul Needham , Galileo Makes a Book ( 2011 ). All three are notable for their use of running-title evidence for identification of skeleton-formes, but their handling of all techniques is exemplary. In connection with run- ning titles, it is worth noting that Needham's chapter "Parallel Printing and Running Titles" (pp. 155–165), written with David L. Vander Meu- len , sets out the running-title evidence in three tables with grid lines: the first lists the different settings of the running titles and shows (with vertical columns for each sheet) where each one appears; the second is organized by forme and indicates which setting is on each page of each forme; and the third, arranged by sheet, shows (with vertical columns for each setting) all the settings that appear in each sheet. These tables illustrate one way in which the more compressed presentation I suggested can be modified to produce still greater clarity in some instances. A fourth work, though it does not as readily serve the function of an introduction, offers a com- prehensive (if flawed) example of how to investigate printing practices: Claire M. Bolton's The Fifteenth-Century Printing Practices of Johann Zainer , Ulm, 1473–1478 ( 2016 ), which pays attention to tolerances in measure- ments (pp. 28–29, 54–56) and includes chapters on printers' measures (pp. 81–118), on point-holes (pp. 192–219), and on blind impressions from bearer type (pp. 119–158) and from the cloth used to dampen the paper (pp. 159–191); cautions about using this work are expressed by B. J. Mc- Mullin in Script &amp; Print , 41 ( 2017 ), 58–62. Beyond these works, many analyses of more limited scope have ap- peared since 1999 , and I shall list some of them as useful examples of a variety of techniques (arranged here in the order followed in the 1999 essay): IDENTIFIABLE TYPES AND ORNAMENTS.

The matter of "localization" (detecting features that are characteristic of printing practices in different geographical areas) was taken up briefly in note 16 of my essay; the references there can now be supplemented with Carlo Dumontet's "Compositorial Practices in Seventeenth-Century Naples" (Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 98 [ 2004 ], 149–161) and with Robert Dawson's article listed just above. It was only in connection with localization of compositorial practices that I mentioned the placement of printed signatures. But the role of signature positions in distinguishing editions, an old (and continuingly useful) technique that has also been a part of some "fingerprinting" sys- tems for shorthand identification of editions (see "Relation to Library Cataloguing" above), is discussed in my Bibliographical Analysis , p. 103. Also in that book I commented (pp. 58–59) on the situation (not un- common in nineteenth-century books printed from plates, especially American ones) where printed signatures do not correspond to the actual gatherings. Analysis of such signatures can sometimes reveal structural decisions made during the production of a book. For example, Melville's Clarel (as I pointed out in the Northwestern-Newberry Edition [ 1991 ], pp. 678–679) was published in two volumes gathered in eights, but its occasional printed signatures do not match that structure. An analysis of the occurrence of those signatures suggests that the original plan was for a one-volume publication gathered in twelves (and that signatures for the earlier plan were incompletely removed). B. J. McMullin has recently analyzed a number of examples of conflicting signatures, in "Gather- ings and Signatures in Conflict" ( Script &amp; Print , 39 [ 2015 ], 241–247). He groups them into two categories: those where the discrepancy between signatures and gatherings was unintended, resulting from an unforeseen event or decision at a time when it would have been inconvenient to make alterations; and those where two or more sets of signatures are present, resulting from a plan to accommodate different impositions. Both situa- tions normally imply printing from plates, since the removal or insertion of signatures after plating would be especially time-consuming. (See also McMullin's "Cowper's Complete Poetical Works , 1837 ( Russell , 166)," Script &amp; Print, 40 [ 2016 ], 45–54.) The line in which signatures are printed, just below the text of a page (the "direction line"), sometimes contains symbols or numbers that are not regular signatures, as may happen in the direction lines on other pages as well. In a footnote (note 58) to my discussion of press figures, I mentioned several other kinds of notation that may occur in direction lines. In his Foxcroft Lecture for 2012 , B. J. McMullin provided a much expanded discussion of these matters (What Readers Should Ignore on the Printed Page: Communication within the Book Trade , 2014 ). Besides giving a basic introduction to press figures (pp. 7, 8–10), he comments on sev- eral types of "communication between printer and binder": paper-quality marks (pp. 7–8; see under "Paper" above), sheet numbers (p. 11), part numbers in works published serially (pp. 11–12), and modified signatures to handle "disturbances in the printing house" (such as added material, errors in casting off, and cancels, pp. 12–17). He concludes with a very different form of binders' instructions: actual statements printed vertically along left edges or on leaves containing text for binding labels (pp. 17–19, supplementing his 2010 article on binders' instructions: see "Ideal Copy" above). All his discussions are accompanied by reproductions of examples, and his lecture as a whole is a convenient summary of one class of biblio- graphical evidence that should be analyzed and recorded by descriptive bibliographers (as should discrepancies in catchwords, which are another feature of direction lines). A technique not mentioned in my 1999 essay is the use of variations in leading (the spacing between lines of type) to identify different printings of the same edition; for an explanation, see Gillian G. M. Kyles , "Alteration of Leading within Editions," in Studies in Bibliography , 52 ( 1999 ), 187–191. My 1999 essay (followed by my 2009 book) does touch on the means for distinguishing whether type or plates were used to print particular pages or books, but it does not raise the question of distinguishing Monotype from Linotype. I wish to pass along here a detail communicated to me by David L. Vander Meulen: he was told by the printer of Studies in Bib- liography (in the days when that journal was printed from Linotype) that occasionally an individual Linotype matrix might not be seated properly before the slug was poured. Thus a slug might contain a type-high space that would print (as happened in Studies in Bibliography , 35 [ 1982 ], 275); and what one might ordinarily think would be a sign of printing from separate types cannot be assumed to be so. This situation is analogous to that in which a shifting type is caught in one of its misaligned positions when a stereotype plate was made. Comparison of multiple copies will of course show no further shifting in either the stereotype or Linotype instances. We are now surely beyond the point where the logical validity and scholarly value of analytical bibliography can be questioned. D. F. Mc- Kenzie's "Printers of the Mind" in the 1969 Studies in Bibliography was the culmination of a tradition of doing so. But I hope that my repeated comments on it—in my 1999 essay, in the earlier pieces cited in its note 6, in my 2004 overview of McKenzie's work ( Papers of the Biblio- graphical Society of America , 98 [ 2004 ], 511–521; reprinted in my Portraits and Reviews [ 2015 ], pp. 405–415), and in my 2009 book (pp. 26–29)— have sufficiently summarized the reasons for continuing the attempt to uncover, from the physical evidence in individual books, the printing- shop activities that produced those books. Recently a new assessment of McKenzie's essay was put forward by Joseph A. Dane in Blind Impres- sions: Methods and Mythologies in Book History ( 2013 ), in a chapter called "Bibliographers of the Mind" (pp. 58–72). Although he does not cite my comments, he makes some of the same points, especially noting the problems entailed by McKenzie's elevation of printers' records over the books themselves as primary evidence—and as unfailingly accurate docu- ments at that. Even if what Dane says is not new, the central five pages of his chapter (pp. 63–68) are worth reading for his striking way of stat- ing the defects of McKenzie's piece. For example, he rightly says that if primary evidence is limited to external evidence (printers' records), then McKenzie's "criticisms of analytical bibliography are little better than tautologies" (p. 68). Given this sound evaluation, it seems contradictory that Dane calls McKenzie's piece "the article that should have sounded the death knell on compositorial study" (p. 60). The attempt to define individual composi- tors' habits is only one kind of analysis, and Dane's focus wavers between analytical bibliography in general and compositor study in particular. He seems to have an irrational dislike for the latter, saying "I have never be- lieved in the virtues of compositorial analysis" (p. 59) and "The habits of a compositor … are not interesting to me" (p. 70). He adds, irrelevantly, "I cannot think of a single case where a significant Shakespeare word or phrase is better documented because we have determined compositorial stints." This statement, even if true, is irrelevant because (1) there is al- ways the possibility that such analysis might be productive in the hands of future scholars, and (2) the value of an analytical technique does not turn on its usefulness for establishing texts. Whatever can be learned about the production of a book is a contribution to history, whether or not it helps editors. A far more consequential criticism of compositor study (at least when dependent on variant spellings) has been offered by Pervez Rizvi in "The Use of Spellings for Compositor Attribution in the First Folio" (Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 110 [ 2016 ], 1–53). After an amazingly thorough and fascinating analysis (based on many more spellings than have conventionally been used), Rizvi concludes that compositors' spell- ings were so variable as to "support or rebut almost any attribution" and thus to "call into question the point of doing this work at all" (p. 43). The idea that individual compositors might have had no fixed spelling prefer- ences (and might have been influenced in their choices by a great many factors, or simply the whim of the moment) should not be surprising, for it accords with human nature. But human beings have varying dispositions, and some compositors may actually have had firm spelling habits; investi- gating other editions in the way Rizvi has examined the First Folio would not necessarily prove inconclusive in every case. After all, even within the Folio, the division of Macbeth between two compositors, first proposed in 1920 , "remains unchallenged and still appears very convincing," accord- ing to Rizvi (p. 18). This degree of success may be rare, but it is possible. Whether or not the tabulation of spellings (and abbreviations, punctua- tion, and spacing) results in a convincing determination of compositorial divisions, it gives one information, for the pervasive variation that defies interpretation is itself a fact about the typesetting of a particular edition (and about the historical development of written language). Rizvi has provided bibliographers with a more comprehensive set of cautions for pursuing this kind of work than they have had before. (The sensible re- quirements suggested by Mark Bland in A Guide to Early Printed Books and Manuscripts [ 2010 ], pp. 139–140, are commendable, but they should now be supplemented by an awareness of Rizvi's observations.) Compositor analysis of all kinds has long been recognized as some- what more speculative than presswork analysis (though the latter is not without its problems); but ruling out any potentially helpful approach is unwise. A great deal of historical research in all fields leads to results that are less than certain, but that is no reason to abandon it, when conducted responsibly with awareness of the pitfalls. Books are full of traces of their own production, and (as I have said many times) scholars must persist in making every effort to tap this great body of evidence. The point has been especially well argued by David L. Vander Meulen in "Thoughts on the Future of Bibliographical Analysis" (Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada , 46 [ 2008 ], 17–34); he concludes that it is "important to proceed with an understanding of the role of the physical in human activity and the role of physical evidence in revealing the past and understanding the present." This is ultimately the reason that we must follow the clues we find in books, using all the tools at our disposal. NON-LETTERPRESS MATERIAL The treatment of illustrative materials in books (such as pictures and maps), especially those—like engravings and lithographs—produced by non-relief processes, is taken up in my "The Description of Non-Letterpress Material in Books," Studies in Bibliography , 35 ( 1982 ), 1–42. Since that time the most important relevant book for descriptive bibliographers, at least from a practical point of view, is Bamber Gascoigne's How to Identify Prints: A Complete Guide to Manual and Mechanical Processes from Woodcut to Ink Jet ( 1986 ). After explaining the different kinds of prints (sections 1–46), it provides "Keys to Identification" (47–79) and suggests how to proceed ("The Sherlock Holmes Approach," 82–106). It is full of enlarged photo- graphs of details; there is no better source of help for bibliographers who wish to identify the process used to produce a given print. Another important book, which bibliographers should not overlook, is Joseph Viscomi's Blake and the Idea of the Book ( 1993 ). Although his book deals with only one process, relief etching, its first 150 pages describe that process with a well-illustrated account that is perhaps the most thorough exposition of a graphic process ever written. The broader significance of the book for bibliographers, however, is its thoughtful discussion of vari- ants among copies printed from the same plate. In the case of Blake's il- lustrated books, prints were produced in batches at discrete periods; each batch has certain stylistic features (especially in coloring) that distinguish it, and each subsumes various lesser variations. Although Viscomi calls these batches "editions" (since "impressions" in graphic-art terminology refers to each "copy"), they clearly are analogous to what bibliographers of printed books call "impressions" or "printings." The example of Blake is of course unique in some ways, but Viscomi's approach to it provides a model for thinking about variants in non-letterpress material in general. As I noted in my 1982 essay, bibliographers often need to relate a given illustration (and different states of it that may appear in different copies of an edition) to its history as an independent entity (offered for sale on its own); and reading Viscomi can help a bibliographer to approach this problem. (He also deals with the editorial implications of his analysis: see my review in Nineteenth-Century Literature , 49 [1994–95], 534–537, reprinted in Portraits and Reviews [ 2015 ], pp. 334–337.) One more basic and distinctive publication is Roger Gaskell's "Print- ing House and Engraving Shop: A Mysterious Collaboration" (The Book Collector , 53 [ 2004 ], 213–251). He begins by pointing out, quite rightly, that bibliography has been verbal-text-oriented and that "a bibliography of images" is needed, one that deals not only with inserted illustrations but also those (even when produced on different presses) that appear on the same pages as verbal text. His approach thus moves a step beyond my essay, which was largely concerned with inserted plates. After an account of the history and process of copperplate printing (drawing on the early rolling-press manuals), Gaskell makes a number of observations based on an examination of some seventeenth-century books with engravings. He notes, for example, that plates were usually printed on the mould side of the paper, with chainlines parallel to the shorter sides of the image. The paper was usually different from that used for the letterpress because the plates were normally printed by a different printer at a different location, and often two or more images (sometimes intended for different books) were printed on the same sheet; the plates for a given book appear on mixed paper stocks somewhat more often than the letterpress text does. Descriptive bibliographers will be particularly interested in knowing (whether or not the intended placement of plates was specified in print) that printers occasionally put the plates in their proper positions before sending the folded and gathered sheets to the binder (who, in first-class work, may have removed them before beating the sheets and then re- placed them). Sometimes engravings were printed on the same sheets as letterpress text, and in those instances the letterpress was printed first, with spaces left for the engravings, before the sheets were sent to the rolling-press printer (with faulty register a not uncommon result). It is worth remembering, as Gaskell notes, that engravings would have been added to the letterpress in a single press run for the whole edition and are thus less likely to display variations than inserted plates, which could have been printed before or after the letterpress and possibly in distinct batches. Gaskell concludes with advice for descriptive bibliographers: that they should record "the spatial relationship of graphics and verbal text, the internal reference systems in use, [and] the placing and folding of the plates" (p. 233), all of which help to reveal author' and publishers' inten tions. Although Gaskell focuses on engravings, he includes a discussion of woodcuts (pp. 232–233) and believes that his approach is applicable to lithography. His article should be required reading for all descriptive bibliographers who deal with illustrated books. A good analysis of an instance of adding an engraving to letterpress is offered by Randall McLeod ("Orlando F. Booke") in "IMAGIC: a long discourse" (Studies in the Literary Imagination , 32.1 [Spring 1999 ], 190–215). See also Karen Bowen, "Illustrating Books with Engravings: Plantin's Working Practices Revealed" (Print Quarterly , 20 [ 2003 ], 3–34). The pres- ence of engravings on integral letterpress leaves poses no problem for the letterpress collation formula, since those leaves can simply be regarded as letterpress leaves. But sometimes inserted leaves contain both letter- press and non-letterpress, and the question of whether to report them in the letterpress collation or the non-letterpress collation was not taken up in my 1982 essay. Therefore I will add here a generally applicable rule of thumb: when the letterpress part consists of words that connect with the verbal text on the adjacent pages, the insertion belongs in the let- terpress formula; but when the letterpress part is directly related to the non-letterpress image (as with a caption) rather than to the surrounding verbal text, the insertion belongs in the non-letterpress formula. It should also be noted that sometimes a wholly letterpress insertion calls for the same treatment as a non-letterpress one—when, for example, it contains only a chart or a table, without verbal text connecting it to the adjacent pages. (See also my comments, under "Collation" above, regarding the role of textual content in structural formulas.) More information on the rolling press can be found in Anthony Dy- son , "The Rolling-Press: Some Aspects of Its Development from the Seventeenth Century to the Nineteenth Century" (Journal of the Printing Historical Society , 17 [ 1982–83 ], 1–30), and in his Pictures to Print: The Nineteenth-Century Engraving Trade ( 1984 ). Gascoigne can be supplemented on photography by Richard Benson's The Physical Print: A Brief Survey of the Photographic Process ( 2005 ). And for lithography there are the books by the great scholar of the subject, Michael Twyman , including Early Lithographed Books: A Study of the Design and Production of Improper Books in the Age of the Handpress ( 1990 ), which deals with verbal-text books printed entirely by lithography, and A History of Chromolithography ( 2013 ), which includes color plates of sequential color proofs with magnified images. Also useful for bibliographers are Geoffrey Wakeman , Graphic Methods in Book Illustration ( 1981 ); Gavin D. R. Bridson and Donald E. Wendel , Print- making in the Service of Botany ( 1986 ); Lois Olcott Price, "The Development of Photomechanical Book Illustration," in The American Illustrated Book in the Nineteenth Century , ed. Gerald W. R. Ward ( 1987 ), pp. 233–256; Carol Wax, The Mezzotint: History and Technique ( 1990 ); and Bamber Gascoigne, Milestones in Colour Printing, 1457–1859 ( 1997 ). The matter of terminology—that is, the relation of the classificatory terms used by letterpress bibliographers to those used by scholars treat- ing non-letterpress processes—is the main concern of Sarah Tyacke's "Describing Maps," in The Book Encompassed , ed. Peter Davison ( 1992 ), pp. 130–141. Her survey of cartobibliographical approaches to early maps shows that the emphasis has often been on the production of indi- vidual plates (and their states) rather than on the published combinations of images printed from the plates; but she recognizes that cartobibliog- raphy must combine these approaches, and she makes particularly clear the difficulties of accounting for atlas editions made up of widely varying combinations of states of plates. These difficulties have caused some car- tobibliographers to reject the term "edition"; but she believes that "the word 'edition', if sensibly applied, is still useful." She does not, however, formulate her own definition of this or other terms, though she adds, "The balance [in current usage] seems to be coming down in favour of defining the word 'plate' as the equivalent of a book 'edition'" (p. 138). But such a definition applies only to plates as independent entities, not to the collections that form "books" (such as atlases). The random nature of the contents of many (or perhaps most) pre-nineteenth-century atlases causes her to say that "often only the title and text are the identifiers of some new stage in their [the plates'] history"—but that in itself points to a distinct publishing effort that can define an edition of a book as a whole, regardless of how many variants exist within it. As I pointed out in 1982 , a basic complication of dealing with all non-letterpress contribu- tions to books, not just maps, is that they often have separate histories outside the books; but that complication does not prevent the application of standard bibliographical classification both to the printed plates and to the books. Bibliographers who wish to gain additional background for thinking about these questions may find Tyacke's essay useful. An excellent example of a descriptive bibliography concerned with books consisting entirely of engravings is David Hunter's Opera and Song Books Published in England , 1703–1726 ( 1997 ). His approach is notable for his recognition that "the standard techniques of bibliographical descrip- tion and the concepts of analytical bibliography … are applicable to non-letterpress material" (p. xxiv). They "have all been tested," he says (in his thorough discussion of "Bibliographical Description" in his introduc- tion, pp. xxiv-xxxvi), "and have been found to apply"—with only a few adjustments needed. One of them is that for these books an impression (in the bibliographer's sense of the copies printed at one time) is often distinguished by whether one or both sides of each leaf were printed, or else by the use of modified "passe-partout" title pages (in which the plate has a blank space to be filled in, usually with text from an extra small plate). These books represent the earliest extensive use of passe-partout title pages, which are the most distinctive feature that Hunter had to deal with. To accommodate them, he created two new symbols for use in title-page transcriptions to mark the beginnings and ends of the blank spaces. Other small modifications arise from the fact that these books are made up primarily of disjunct leaves printed one at a time, and often on only one side. Bibliographers dealing with the same kind of books will be helped by examining Hunter's thoughtful practice, whether or not they decide to follow it in every respect. An article expressing the same conclusion as Hunter's—that "the standard methods of descriptive bibliography" can be used in dealing with engraved matter—is Ronald K. Smeltzer's "Typographic Books from Intaglio Printing Plates" (Caxtonian [Caxton Club], 24.5 [May 2016 ], 1–5). The difference here is that Smeltzer focuses on verbal-text books printed entirely from intaglio plates, with each plate being made up of multiple text-pages arranged for folding into gatherings (and even bearing signatures). Obviously the structure of such books can be represented by the usual style of formula that is regularly employed for letterpress books. Smeltzer's only innovation arises from the fact that the book he chooses to describe has three inserted letterpress leaves of verbal text, and he proposes noting them within the formula in bold-face type, to distinguish them from the intaglio-printed leaves. This suggestion seems appropri- ate in such an instance, for nothing would be gained (and indeed some clarity lost) by creating a second formula for the few letterpress leaves of verbal text. Thus there can be occasions on which it is not objection- able to report the products of two different printing processes in a single formula, as long as the two are clearly distinguished. The nature of the content of the inserted leaves is likely to play a role, as I suggested above in connection with leaves that combine letterpress with intaglio. The book Smeltzer describes also has nine engraved folding illustrations inserted, but he sensibly does not include them in the formula for the gathered sheets and letterpress inserts, even though they were printed by the same method as the gathered sheets. An example of an unusually detailed description of a plate book is Lord Wardington's "Sir Robert Dudley and the Arcano del Mare . 1646–8 and 1661 " ( The Book Collector , 52 [ 2003 ], 317–355). Other good, but less elaborate, descriptions of plates are in Paul W. Nash's "Pinxit, Sculpsit, Excudit, Etcetera: Some Notes on the Lettering Which Appears on Prints" (The Private Library , 5th ser., 4 [ 2001 ], 148–187); but the most useful part of his article, as the title suggests, is its glossary of terms and abbreviations used in prints, which serves as a supplement to Gascoigne's section 48 ("Words below the Image"). One bibliography that focuses exclusively on the illustrations in the books it records is the second volume of Nigel Tattersfield's monumental Thomas Bewick ( 2011 ). A helpful discursive and evaluative guide to the literature is Gwyn Walters's "Developments in the Study of Book Illustration" (covering primarily post- 1945 work, includ- ing the history of science), in The Book Encompassed , pp. 142–150. Fuller listings are Gavin D. R. Bridson and Geoffrey Wakeman's Printmaking &amp; Picture Printing ( 1984 ); Bridson and James J. White's Plant, Animal &amp; Ana- tomical Illustration in Art &amp; Science ( 1990 ); and my Introduction to Bibliography ( 2002 revision), part 7, pp. 225–236, which includes references both to art-historical works and to technical treatises and cites additional check- lists. The literature is large, but bibliographers cannot avoid exploring some of it if they are to treat the non-letterpress parts of books as carefully as they do the letterpress parts. PUBLISHERS' BINDINGS, ENDPAPERS , AND JACKETS When descriptive bibliographies are conceived as records of books as published, and thus as contributions to publishing history, the only bind- ings that are relevant to the basic descriptions are those commissioned by publishers as the outward form in which their books were to be offered to the public. In practice, therefore, most descriptive bibliographies of authors, printers, publishers, and subjects (as opposed to catalogues of specific collections) provide binding descriptions only for books published in edition-bindings, which became common in the 1820 s. Before that time, however, booksellers (or others fulfilling the publishing function) did apparently often place portions of some editions on sale in a form of temporary or unfinished binding; and when such bindings can be identi- fied (as with the boards-and-label style of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries), they would properly be included in basic descrip- tions. (See the comments on the recent work of Nicholas Pickwoad and Aaron T. Pratt under "Ideal Copy" above.) Some account of the craft or custom (that is, non-publishers') bind- ings that are found on most books from before the 1820 s may be given in descriptive bibliographies in the paragraph on the copies examined, where any post-publication features of individual copies can be recorded (see "Arrangement" below). Such accounts, when they exist, are usually very brief; the place where more detailed descriptions of custom bindings occur is in catalogues of collections, where the focus is on the particular copies that happen to have been brought together in those collections. The historical study of the structure and decorative styles of custom book- bindings is a distinct field, with its own terminology and an extensive and distinguished literature. The best sources to turn to for basic guid- ance are relatively recent ones: David Pearson , English Bookbinding Styles 1450–1850 : A Handbook ( 2005 , 2014 ); the chapter on "Armorials, Other Binding Stamps &amp; External Features" in his Provenance Research in Book History ( 1994 ), pp. 97–131; Mirjam M. Foot , "Bookbinding and the His- tory of Books," in A Potencie of Life: Books in Society , ed. Nicolas Barker ( 1993 ), pp. 113–126; Nicholas Pickwoad , "The Interpretation of Book- binding Structure: An Examination of Sixteenth-Century Bindings in the Ramey Collection in the Pierpont Morgan Library," The Library , 6th ser., 17 ( 1995 ), 209–249; and Philipp. J. M. Marks , The British Library Guide to Bookbinding: History and Techniques ( 1998 ). A recent example of a great descriptive catalogue with detailed accounts of bindings is Giles Barber's The James A. De Rothschild Bequest ( 2013 ). Other outstanding work of recent years can be found in any book by A. R. A. Hobson , H. M. Nixon , or Mirjam M. Foot . (A long list of the literature of custom binding appears in my Introduction to Bibliography [ 2002 revision], section 8D, pp. 239–248; for publishers' bindings, see section 8E, pp. 248–251.) In the strictest sense, publishers' "bindings" are not bindings but rather casings, since the cloth-covered boards and spine constitute a case that is manufactured separately and into which the sheets are fastened. But the term "publisher's binding" (or "edition-binding") is widely used and understood, and there is no need to insist on replacing it with "casing" or "case." The description of publishers' bindings requires a means for citing colors and cloth grains; describing endpapers also entails noting colors and sometimes (in the case of marbled papers) the various patterns that marblers have traditionally used; and accounting for jackets obviously in- cludes the identification of colors. I took these matters up in three essays, on color ( 1967 ), patterns ( 1970 ), and jackets ( 1971 , supplemented in 2011 ), including in them some suggested wordings for the relevant paragraphs in descriptive bibliographies. Color "A System of Color Identification for Bibliographical Description" was published in Studies in Bibliography , 20 ( 1967 ), 203–234, and reprinted in my Selected Studies in Bibliography ( 1979 ), pp. 139–170. My recommen- dation of the ISCC-NBS Centroid Color Charts , emerging from an extensive survey of possibilities, was clearly the correct one, and those charts have gained fairly wide acceptance among bibliographers since then. Their use was endorsed in Philip Gaskell's A New Introduction to Bibliography [ 1972 , 1974 ], pp. 238–239, and, for the book-conservation community, in Abbey Newsletter for December 1980 . A list of eighteen bibliographies using the charts was published in 1990 by Craig S. Abbott in "Designating Color in Descriptive Bibliography: The ISCC-NBS Method in Practice" ( Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 84: 119–129). Abbott also explained some of the mistakes made in those bibliog- raphies in the use of the charts, the most basic one being a failure to understand that each chip represents the center of the color-name block designated by the accompanying number and abbreviated name. Thus bibliographers who say their matches are inexact do not recognize that their choice of the closest match in each case does in fact provide an exact match to the area surrounding the centroid chip. I made this point in 1967 , but it cannot be stated too often, considering how frequently bibliographers have misunderstood it. (Although Abbott objects to the phrase "centroid number"—and the citation of a specific number in the form "Centroid 191"—as indicative of this confusion, I think the usage can be condoned as a shorthand version of "the number associated with a chip in the ISCC-NBS Centroid Color Charts .") Abbott further notes that bibliographers have sometimes misinterpreted the abbreviations assigned to the color-name blocks and expanded them improperly—not realizing, for instance, that lower-case letters indicate the "-ish" form of a color name (so that "yG," yellowish green, is a different color from "YG," yel- low green). As Abbott observes, many bibliographers have seemingly used the charts without consulting the related ISCC-NBS dictionary, where the system used in the color-name abbreviations is explained. His article provides some useful cautions for bibliographers wishing to employ the Centroid Charts . One of the requirements I formulated for an appropriate color- matching system was that there should be "strong assurance of continued availability in the future." Because the Centroid Color Charts were published by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), I believed that they met this requirement. Unfortunately, however, in 1983 the NBS discontinued their sale, pending the results of a test of the stability of the color chips by the color consultant H. Hemmendinger; and in February 1984 the NBS dis- covered that twenty-seven of the chips (out of 251) had shifted enough to move from one color-name block to another. Although the charts were included in the NBS's 1984–85 catalogue of Standard Reference Materials and in the March 1984 price list, they did not appear in the October 1984 price list and have not been available from the NBS since then. On 6 April 1984 I wrote a long letter to Richard W. Seward of the Standard Reference Materials section, explaining why the charts were essential for bibliographical work and (recognizing that bibliographers formed a small constituency) making the obvious point that a color standard was needed in many areas of endeavor. It seemed to me, I said, that a "national bureau of standards" could be expected to provide a standard for color designations. I received no reply, and three months later (on 9 July 1984 ) I telephoned Stanley D. Rasberry , chief of the Office of Standard Refer- ence Materials, with whom I had a cordial but unencouraging conversa- tion. He confirmed that distribution of the charts had stopped, and he said that the only hope for any resumed production (since the NBS did not have its own color laboratory) was the receipt of private funding. There the matter has rested, except that over the years several persons associated with the development of the charts have privately sold copies from the small stock that remained (after the distribution of many cop- ies by the NBS), out of an original edition of 20,000. The most recent of those persons has been Nick Hale , who had been technical director of the Munsell Color Company at the time it oversaw the production of the charts (by the Tobey Color Card Company) and who had alerted the NBS to the problem of shifting in 1983 . Hale's possession of the stock was publicized to the bibliographical world on 19 July 1996 by Sandra Alston (of the Fisher Library at the University of Toronto) through the email list of the Bibliographical Society of Canada. When Hale (then of Hale Color Consultants, Inc., which is now in Naples , Florida ) sent out copies, he included with each set a statement about the color shifts, along with a thorough report of the results of the 1984 measurements; and as of June 2003 , at which time about 150 sets were left, he also enclosed a brief ac- count of the history of the Centroid Charts . The significant color-chip shifts discovered in 1984 —that is, the twenty-seven that shifted from one color-name block to another—are as follows: the chip for block 24 shifted to block 235; 56 to 59; 59 to 62; 75 to 78; 108 to 110; 118 to 125; 126 to 138; 129 to 131; 139 to 141; 147 to 166; 194 to 197; 195 to 199; 196 to 200; 197 to 201; 198 to 202; 200 to 204; 206 to 210; 208 to 212; 213 to 202; 215 to 229; 218 to 223; 220 to 225; 221 to 226; 225 to 243; 239 to 259; 247 to 250; and 257 to 260. Persons who consult descriptive bibliographies that cite centroid numbers (and the corresponding color names) should be aware that these twenty-seven numbers may not be accurate (depending on the date of the bibliogra- pher's work). But given the approximate nature of such citations in the first place, along with the fact that the only major chip shifts are to closely related color blocks, the shifting is not likely to render any previously written description seriously defective. The copies of the charts that are used in connection with reading these bibliographies may not of course precisely match those that were used by the bibliographers, but this situ- ation is not a serious problem. In 2003 , Hale expressed the belief, based on his long experience, that the chips had probably changed very little since 1984 and thus were still usable. Whether new descriptions, however, should be based on the Centroid Charts is a question that one might at first think ought to be answered in the negative. After all, they are not readily available, and at least twenty- seven of the samples in them are not accurate. But it may be that there is no satisfactory alternative from a practical point of view. The two main contenders are the charts produced by the Munsell Color Company and by Pantone, Inc. Munsell has tradition behind it, since the Munsell system is the fundamental one of the twentieth century (see my discussion of it in the 1967 essay) and is in fact the system on which the centroid sampling of the color solid is based. And the Munsell Book of Color is published in two editions, one with glossy and the other with matte samples (over 1600 of them). The fact that matte samples are available and that the samples are removable makes the Munsell Book especially appropriate for bibliographi- cal use (and it is indeed widely employed for scientific as well as industrial purposes). It is unwieldy, however, and at present each edition costs about $1000. It is not suitable for bibliographers to carry easily with them, and most will not wish to spend the money on a copy. Libraries could of course be encouraged to purchase copies for their special-collections reading rooms, but inevitably bibliographers will still find many places without a copy. Pantone is more commercially oriented than Munsell, but bibliogra- phers will be interested in the fact that the Pantone system is frequently used in the graphic-design and printing industries. There is a wide variety of Pantone Matching System Color Guides for different purposes; most take the form of fans (some with over 1700 colors), provide either coated or uncoated samples, identify each one with a Pantone number and name, and cost in the $100–$500 range. A loose-leaf book is also available, as well as apps for mobile devices. And there are several websites (such as www.pantone-colours.com) that offer comprehensive showings of Pan- tone colors, each labeled only with a Pantone number; but matching to a computer screen is not recommended, since colors can vary from one screen to another. (Pantone is a subsidiary of X-Rite, which offers spec- trophotometers, but besides their costliness they go beyond the specificity required for bibliography.) A compact and convenient book does exist, called The Pantone Book of Color ( 1990 ), by Leatrice Eiseman and Lawrence Herbert , who provide an informative introduction. It displays 1024 col- ors labeled with Pantone numbers and with names; the Pantone names, however, are often fanciful—such as "dusty jade green" or "moonlite mauve" or "apricot wash"—and are not appropriate for bibliographical citation. The matter of naming is vitally important, since a description must enable one to visualize a color without recourse to a chart (though a chip number is there for times when greater precision is needed). The merit of the ISCC-NBS naming system (used in the Centroid Charts ) is that only commonly understood adjectives are used. The ISCC-NBS dictionary (discussed in my essay) enables one to convert Munsell notations as well as centroid numbers to the standard color names; but the use of Pantone numbers (though it would allow easy access to an approximation of the colors on the internet) would not accommodate the use of those names. Taking all these considerations into account, bibliographers would be well advised to follow one of two courses. (1) Continue to use the Centroid Charts , since 89.2% of the chips are probably still accurate (in that any shifting has not moved them out of their color-name blocks) and since the other 10.8% can be assumed to have shifted to such closely related color- name blocks as not to invalidate a description (which in any case refers to a segment of the color solid, not a single point). (2) Use the Munsell Book of Color when convenient to do so, supplementing it at other times with the Centroid Charts; combining the two in a single bibliography poses no problem as long as all the names are expressed in the ISCC-NBS standard forms. Besides the ISCC-NBS dictionary, another source for the equiva- lences is a website provided by the Texas Precancel Club, which lists the centroid numbers and names along with the equivalent Munsell nota- tions and small color samples: search the internet for "NBS/ISCC Color System - Tx4.us", or use "tx4.us/nbs-iscc.htm". An example of a bibliog- raphy that uses the centroid system and also supplies the corresponding Munsell notation in each instance (as "perhaps more accessible") is David Alan Richards's Kipling ( 2010 ), which thus sets a valuable precedent. Patterns The essay I wrote on "The Bibliographical Description of Patterns" (covering cloth grains and marbled papers, as well as the stamping applied to the cloth for particular editions) appeared in Studies in Bibliography , 23 ( 1970 ), 71–102, and was reprinted in my Selected Studies in Bibliography ( 1979 ), pp. 171–202. Since that time there has been a great deal of interest in the description of nineteenth-century publishers' bindings; but there is one publication that stands out as a promising guide for future use. It is Andrea Krupp's Bookcloth in England and America, 1823–50 ( 2008 ), a slightly revised version of an article in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 100 ( 2006 ), 25–87. This work emerged from an ongoing project by two conservators ( Krupp and Jennifer Woods Rosner ) at the Library Company of Philadelphia called "The Database of Nineteenth-Century Cloth Bindings (available online via the Library Company's website, under "Collections," then "Conservation Department Research on Bindings"). Based on the Library Company's holdings, each entry in this excellently designed database includes more than sixty fields of data on binding cloth and design, binding structure, sewing patterns, and endpapers, providing a wealth of information that is beginning to make possible a more detailed understanding of the history of publishers' bindings and a more exact determination of the dates of undated books or successive bindings-up. The heart of the publication (in both 2006 and 2008 ) is a "Catalogue of Nineteenth-Century Bookcloth Grains" containing actual-size color photographs of 125 grain patterns (plus six variants)—far more than have been published in previous sets of photographs for bibliographical use. Krupp thinks of her book as a "'field guide' for identifying and dating nineteenth-century bookcloth." Each photograph is labeled with a reference code and a descriptive name. The basic names are the ones previously used by Carter , Sadleir , Gaskell , Ball , and me, though some of the modifying adjectives are new, and "moiré" is taken as a family name, not a modifier. ( Krupp claims that I use "a different approach"—different from supplying names—by as- signing "letter and number codes"; but I emphasized in my essay, as I do again now, the importance of a standard terminology consisting of com- monly understood words.) The codes consist of three-letter abbreviations of the grain families, with attached numbers reflecting the arbitrary order of the photographs within each family. Thus "Ban8: Fine dotted ribbon" is the eighth photograph in the section devoted to the "Bands" family, and "Wav3: Diagonal wave" is the third in the "Waves" section. The twelve families are Bands; Beads; Diapers and Diamonds; Hexagonal; Leather Textures; Moiré; Nets and Meshes; Ribs; Ripples; Sand, Pebble, Bubble; Waves; and Weaves and Checkerboards—supplemented with a "Miscel- laneous" section and one called "Winterbottom," which shows sixteen grains from the Winterbottom Book Cloth Company's swatchbooks that have appeared in reference works and thatrepresent versions of patterns used in the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. This "Catalogue" is accompanied by a "Table of Nineteenth-Century Bookcloth Grains," which for each grain states thenumber of examples thus far entered in the database and their date range (extremely useful information) and then, for any grain illustrated in one of seven previously published sets of photo- graphs (Carter, Sadleir, BAL , Tanselle, Gaskell, Ball, and Winterbottom), gives the corresponding notations. There is also a separate set of color photographs called "Catalogue of Nineteenth-Century Ribbon-Embossed Bookcloth," consisting of 122 examples (plus six variants) of abstract, flo- ral, and geometric patterns that are "larger than 6 mm. per repeat." The result is a reference work that surpasses in various respects any- thing available before—though any of the earlier reference works can still be used, preferably with Krupp numbers also cited (and her "Ta- ble" makes it relatively easy to give such correspondences). But inevi- tably questions may be raised. Although Krupp has not tried to create a logically comprehensive system of classification (simply listing families of patterns in alphabetical order), one may still question the inclusion of a "Miscellaneous" section. And the "Winterbottom" section results from her belief that merging Winterbottom's late nineteenth-and early twentieth-century versions of patterns into the sections displaying earlier versions would be misleading. But its presence shows that the "Catalogue of Nineteenth-Century Bookcloth Grains"is not meant to be limited to the 1823–50 period (the dates in the title of the book), even though the bulk of the examples in the "Catalogue" (and "Database") are from be- fore 1869 , reflecting thework thus far done with the holdings of the Li- brary Company. The insertion of the Winterbottom examples in their proper places, however, would not mislead anyone since their dates (like the dates of all the other examples) are included in the "Table"—and perhaps all the dates should be given in the captions to the photographs as well. Taking this step would make clearer the way in which Krupp's "Catalogue" can gradually be expanded in the future. The same thoughts are raised by Krupp's segregation of ribbon- embossed patterns into a separate catalogue, using a different style of codes for patterns (and for variants) and providing no names. She rec- ognizes that "another option would be to give each pattern a name (or a code) and integrate them fully into one large table…. There is certainly much more work to be done in that area than the amount of attention I have given them here" (p. 16). It is worth noting that when she generalizes about the number of patterns, she does include ribbon-embossed exam- ples in the totals. (One could argue, as I did in note 16 of my 1970 essay, that ribbon-embossed patterns might more feasibly be described individu- ally for each book; yet ribbon-embossed patterns, being a characteristic of cloths prior to their use on individual books,can logically be distinguished from the frames and lettering stamped into the cloth for those books. I will add here that the basic cloth weave can be a distinguishing feature even for embossed cloth and should not be overlooked when examining the embossed pattern.) Incorporating the "Miscellaneous," "Winterbottom," and ribbon-embossed examples into the main body of the "Catalogue" would be a first step toward making Krupp's system (however arbitrary) a more welcoming and appropriate framework for future expansion. The most important discussion of Krupp's work is B. J. McMullin's "Patterned Book Cloth: A Review Essay," in Script &amp; Print , 32 (2008), 163–175. After a historical sketch of the development of bibliographical thinking on the subject (containing some trenchant observations), McMul- lin brings up the basic problem raised by the proliferation of examples shown by Krupp : should the set of photographs be indefinitely expanded as additional grains and variants are noted that do not precisely match any of those already illustrated? The fact that some patterns are provided with an additional photograph or two labeled "var1" or "var2" implies that such expansion is expected. It is not clear, however, why additional photographs would necessarily be preferable to added words for this pur- pose. As McMullin notes, the situation is epitomized in the "diaper" cat- egory, where the illustrations are for ultra-fine diaper (defined as 20–22 units percentimeter), fine (10–15/cm.), medium (8–9/cm.), coarse and smooth (4/cm. each), and (anomalously)"5.5 diaper." The precedent set here would require more photographs for diapers that fall between 15 and 20 units per centimeter, or between 4 and 8 (except for 5.5). But a series of illustrations accomplishes nothing more than is achieved by simply using the word "diaper" followed by the measurement. A photograph of diaper would still be needed, but additional photographs serve no purpose (and indeed can be a complication, since the closest match at one time might no longer be the closest match after the insertion of morephotographs). The "Beads," "Nets," and "Ribs" categories offer exactly the same situ- ation, but in all categories the adjectives of degree ("coarse," "fine," etc.) do not cover all the possibilities. Such omissions occur, of course, because the photographs represent the books thus far examined for the "Database"; but a comprehensive "field guide" to a class of artifacts cannot be constructed in that way because, even at the price of continued revisions, it will always be unsat- isfying in certain situations. The "Database" itself is a great accomplish- ment; and as it grows—incorporating, one hopes, records from many collections other than the Library Company's—it will become even more comprehensive as a record from which historical accounts of publishers' bindings can be drawn. And it is appropriate that a field guide should be a by-product of such a database. But the relation between the two needs to be further thought through. In one respect the field guide is bound to grow as the database does, because a field guide should illustrate all distinct patterns, however rarely used some of them are. But in another respect it should not grow, for if it attempts to register variations of dis- tinctpatterns it will become more bewildering than helpful. Deciding which patterns are "distinct" may to some extent be debatable, but it is not nearly as intractable a problem as defining variations within them, since the latter are nearly infinite in number. A classification scheme, by definition, should deal with diversity not by reproducing it but by pro- viding a path through it. Contrasting the classification of bookcloth with that of color helps to illustrate the problem. As I pointed out in my 1970 essay, color is anatural phenomenon with definite limits and a continuum within those limits; one can thus scientifically sample that continuum at spatial intervals. Cloth patterns do not offer this opportunity, for it is not possible to determine "centroids" within their variations. One can of course subdivide patterns according to measurements of their repeated units, as Krupp has done in a few instances (though her measurements are not based on regular intervals); but, given the essential difference between patterns and color, the result would not provide a necessary visual aid, as centroid colors do. Since the large number of photographs in Krupp's "Catalogue" is not entirely an advantage, bibliographers may well find it preferable to limit themselves primarily to her examples inwhich the name of the grain has no adjective or measurement attached and then to add whatever modifiers seem necessary on a given occasion—as in "coarse (8/cm.) Rib (cf. Krupp Rib3)." The fact that Krupp's photographs are actual size al- lows one to know(through direct measurement of unit-repeats in cases where a measurement is not stated) the norm fromwhich "coarse" and "fine" variants depart. (The use of "cf." in my example seems desirable, though it differs slightly from my 1970 suggestion. Even when the specific variant is pictured in Krupp . it might be better to cite only the Krupp photograph of the basic pattern, both for uniformity and to allow for possible future revisions in Krupp's "Catalogue.") Bibliographers could also do their matching against the photographs I have published or those provided by Gaskell (see below), since the smaller number of examples in those sets (36 and 29 respectively) do after all include the great majority of patterns found on nineteenth-century books and since the basic names given in them are the same as those used by Krupp . This last point is not crucial, however, because Krupp's "Table" al- lows one, when consulting (or writing) a bibliography employing any of seven sets of photographs other than hers, to find a picture of the cited grain in the "Catalogue"—and to find it online. Indeed, it is the presence online of the "Catalogue" (along with the associated "Database") that makes Krupp seem the most convenient reference for bibliographers to cite, despite its limitations. One hopes that the "Table" will be added to the online resources, since without it one still has to turn to the printed book (or article) to make conversions between Krupp's code and earlier ones and to learn the date range of each grain; and the measurement of repeated units in every grain should be stated, since the pictures on the website are no longer actual size.Presumably the online version will be continuously revised to incorporate new grains (as the database grows) and perhaps to rectify some of the flaws in the printed versions. Most bibliographers and users of bibliographies are likely to have a portable electronic device at hand as they examine books, or will not find it incon- venient to make sure that they do. Bibliographers should be aware of two other very large databases of bindings that allow for searching by a particular cloth grain; although they give one access to many images of bindings, neither is as appropriate as the Library Company's for bibliographers to use as a basic reference in identifying the cloth on a book in hand. One is "Publishers' Bindings Online 1815–1930 : The Art of Books" (on the website of theUniversity of Alabama Library and the University of Wisconsin—Madison Library, the partners in this project). It does provide (under "Research Tools") a "Gallery of Book-Cloth Grain Patterns" showing fifteen basic grains la- beled with standard names; each image can be enlarged and offers a link for searching the database for examples of books bound in that cloth. The notes on each book include the color and grain of the binding but do not come close to providing the amount of technical detail about binding and endpaper structure that the Library Company database does. Its emphasis is not primarily on bibliographical research (there are artistic, historical, and literary "galleries," each with essays and teaching tools), but it does offer a "gallery" of bindings by decade, accompanied by commentary. The other database is the British Library's "Database of Bookbindings" (on the Library's website, under "Catalogues," then "Bookbindings"), which has excellent technical notes, including the identification of cloth grains bystandard names. But since it covers the whole history of book- binding as represented in the Library's collections, it contains a relatively small selection of publishers' cloth bindings, and it provides only a verbal (not a pictorial) guide to cloth-grain names for purposes of searching. In addition to Krupp . there are three other significant post-1970 treat- ments of cloth grains. Two years after my essay, Philip Gaskell's A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972, 1974) appeared, containing a section on "Publisher's Cloth in Britain and America" (pp. 238–247). Besides giving a compact history of the development of cloth bindings (and summarizing the ISCC-NBS color system), Gaskell provides a classification of grains and a set of photographs. He follows ingeneral my system of classifi- cation and the naming of individual grains, though he leaves out one ("weave"), adds four ("beaded-line," "crocodile," "crackle," and "frond"), and moves two to a different family ("bubble" becomes one of the "sand- texture" grains, and "cord" becomes "ribbed-morocco" under "leather- texture"). As for associated codes, Gaskell simply assigns each photograph a number according to its place in the sequence of illustrations in his book as a whole (beginning with "Fig. 84"). Thus his codes (unlike mine) do not reflect a classification scheme; butthat fact is of little significance since the order of the photographs (unlike Krupp's arbitrary order) does follow his classification and brings related families together. Sensibly he provides only a single photograph for each basic pattern— that is, only for grains whose names do not have adjectives of degree at- tached to them. He understands that grains "notably fine or coarse ," for example, can be specified in words, without the presence of photographs (even though, as in all systems, the norm represented by each photograph hasnot been precisely determined). My 1970 set of photographs does include a few fine, coarse, diagonal, and moiré examples for illustrative purposes but without suggesting that such photographs are necessary: I made clear that adjectives should be attached (as needed by the level of precision required) even when there is no matching photograph—and that, when still greater precision is desirable, a bibliographer may have to supply one or more additional photographs. The only thing I would now add—whether one is using my system or Gaskell 's or Krupp's —is that the greater precision sometimes needed to distinguish, for example, separate bindings-up (or secondary bindings) can often best be achieved by providing a measurement. On the subject of measurement, I should perhaps say that when a published photograph is intended only for gen- eral matching of a type of design (as opposed to serving as a record of the binding of a specific book), one does not need to know whether the photograph is actual size or not; but a measurement scale attached to a photograph (as in Krupp's basic catalogue but not her catalogue of ribbon-embossed patterns) is nevertheless helpful in determining when a match has been made. Thirteen years after Gaskell 's book, Douglas Ball published Victorian Publishers' Bindings (1985), a thoughtful and well-documented study that includes a chapter entitled "The Decoration and Graining of Cloth and ItsBibliographical Importance" (pp. 24–31). In that chapter, Ball points out the potential (but not always conclusive) role of precise grain identifi- cations in the process of distinguishing and dating separate bindings-up; and he assesses previous bibliographers' presentations of photographs and names of grains. But the most useful parts of his book for descriptive bibliographers are two of the appendixes. The first, "Identification of Cloth Grains" (pp. 123–129), besides pursuing in more detail the limita- tions of some ofthe previously published photographs and the variations in assigned names, offers descriptive comments on the basic families of patterns. One of the emphases throughout—and properly so—is on the importance of measuring the frequency of repeated elements in designs in order to give precision to any modifying adjectives and the norms they relate to. He suggests approximate norms for rib grain (11 repeats per centimeter), ripple (25+/cm.), dot-and-line (perhaps 2.5–3.5/cm.), checkerboard (perhaps 4/cm.), diaper (6/cm.), and bead (5.5/cm.). Then he offers a particularly helpful discussion of the morocco family (pp. 126– 128), dividing those with "linearly directional" ribs into ribbed morocco (with basically continuous ribs and converging channels, 8–9/cm.), cord (with ribs separated by cross-creases, 8–9/cm.), and parallel cord (with channels that generally do not converge). These measurements may be of use to bibliographers in deciding when to add such adjectives as "fine"; but those adjectives can merely be suggestive, and precision can come only with appended measurements. The second appendix, "Further Data on Grains" (pp. 130–142), consists of two parts, the first being a table of "Dates and Frequency of Use" (pp. 132–136), which assembles informa- tion drawn from some 2600 entries in the first volume of Sadleir's XIX Century Fiction . The data given here, when combined with those in Krupp's "Table," form essential context for discussions of dating. The other part of the appendix, "Some Additional Grains" (pp. 137–141), describes and illustrates seven grains not dealt with in previous sources—but now incor- porated into Krupp's guide. (Bibliographers will also wish to know of the remarkable amount of detail in another appendix, "Nineteenth-Century Edition Binders' Signatures," pp. 168–192). The other of the significant post-1970 books is William Tomlinson and Richard Masters's Bookcloth 1823–1980 (1996). Primarily a detailed and illustrated history of the bookcloth industry, it contains much information not otherwise available, drawing on the knowledge and materials that Tomlinson acquired in a sixty-year career in the field, part of the time with the Winterbottom Book Cloth Company of Manchester, a promi- nent supplier of bookcloth after 1853 and the dominant one from 1891 to 1980. There are two chapters of particular interest for bibliographers, "Description of Bookcloth Qualities: (pp. 86–107) and "Identification of Designs (Grains)" (pp. 108–123), the first supplemented with thirty-six tipped-in cloth swatches and the second with thirty, dating from after 1891 . The first group is instructive in allowing one to feel some of the grades that were being offered at that time; but knowing that a great variety was available (some fifty qualities are described) cannot be put to direct use by bibliographers, who deal with cloth attached to covers. The second group, showing patterns ("designs"), turns out not to be more useful for identification than good photographs. In any case, the late date of all the samples means that this book cannot offer an appropriate gen- eral standard for bibliographers—along with the fact that only arbitrary letter codes are used (though they were employed, with some variation, in the Bibliography of American Literature ). What the book does accomplish is to make clear to bibliographers how inexact all their descriptions are when compared to what was necessary in the cloth trade: in 1948, for example, Winterbottom's advertised "41 Qualities, 71 Designs and 688 Colours, equal to almost 50,000 different Effects." (Despite this profu- sion, twentieth-century books in general use rather plain cloth and do not display the variety of patterns found on nineteenth-century books.) The authors recognize that bibliographical description does not normally require the same precision as that employed by a cloth supplier,but they add that using cloth as evidence for dating may well require something closer to it. In my 1998 review of this book ( Printing History , 19.1: 39; reprinted in my Portraits and Reviews [2015], pp. 345–347), I cited an example of the kind of information it supplies that is especially valuable for bibliog- raphers: sometimes it was more economical to cut the cloth in a "two- way" fashion rather than "one-way," with the result that the cloth pattern might run vertically on some copies of an edition and horizontally on others (and thus the two directions may not signify separate bindings- up). A footnote to the Tomlinson-Masters bookappeared in 2002 in the form of an article by Willman Spawn and Thomas E. Kinsella ("The Description of Bookcloth: Making a Case for More Precision," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 96: 341–349), which describes the William Tomlinson Bookcloth Collection at Bryn Mawr College and lists the forty-three pattern books it contains (dating from the mid-1920s to the 1980s), plus Winterbottom's 1958 code book. The authors make the point (previously observed by Tomlinson and Masters ) that "established bibliographical conventions do not account for the known complexities of bookcloth"; they grant that descriptive bibliographers may not usually need to go beyond those conventions, but they state (what is clearly true) that book history in general would benefit from research in such archives as exist, for the purpose of discovering the manufacturer, date, and trade specifications for the cloth found on particular books. An additional work displaying cloth grains, but obviously not a can- didate for a bibliographical standard, is Geoffrey Wakeman's Nineteenth Century Trade Binding (1983). Its second volume is a folder containing a sheet with seven leather specimens and another with nine cloth speci- mens, plus four pages showing seventy-one rubbings of Winterbottom designs. Support for Krupp's system comes from another publication: Carlo Dumontet's "Nineteenth-Century Bookcloth Grain Classification and the Special Collections Cataloguer" ( Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 104 [2010], 105–112), which recommends the insertion of her system of naming into the thesaurus of controlled vocabularies for cata- loguers, especially the "Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Online" (on the Getty Research Institute's website) and the Rare Book and Manuscript Section's "Binding Terms" (on its website). The latter is perhaps now superseded by the online "Language of Bindings" thesaurus (established through Nicholas Pickwoad's Ligatus project at the University of the Arts, London ). Some of the problems Dumontet outlines might be alleviated by the adoption of my suggestion (above) of making the unmodified terms the standard, with adjectives and measurements added in specific instances; thus a full verbal description, with as much modifying detail as necessary and with a Krupp reference (including "cf."), could appear in MARC field 563, and the unmodified form (with the possible local addition of a Krupp code) in field 655. Besides describing cloth grains, the bibliographer must also record the designs (abstract and pictorial), frames, and lettering that are stamped (in blind or gold) into the cloth for individual editions. My suggestions in 1970 are probably sufficient for most occasions; but a proposal for greater detail has been offered by Gene G. Freeman in "Descriptive Standards for Publisher's Bindings: Preliminary Notes" ( Trade Bindings Research Newslet- ter , 5 [June 1992], 3–10). Freeman recommends dividing each cover into twenty-four "cells" (six rows of four) and each spine into twelve (six rows of two) and then estimating the percentage of the area in each cell filled withdecoration or lettering. An example is "1ABCD—Author's name, centered, 1A and 1D &lt; 10%." But surely, if "centered" is not enough, it would be far more accurate simply to measure the distance fromeach end of the name to the edge of the cover. He also thinks that a diagram showing the "estimated fillfactor" of each cell "should be included in a descriptive bibliography" because the "distribution of decoration over the book's surface" can help to attribute unsigned bindings to particular designers. Few people, I imagine, will agree with this point, and I see no reason for bibliographers to adopt either of his recommendations. The same issue of this newsletter contains another short article with a promis- ing title, David B. Ogle's "Uniform Notation for Describing Decorative Trade Bindings" (pp. 13–15); but the proposal (assigning a five-letter code to each book, the first two letters abbreviating the color and the last three the type of design) is only intended as a means for collectors to locate their books—though presumably such a code, if searchable in a library's database, could have some usefulness. Charles S. Kamen , in the next two issues of the newsletter ("Further Binding Description Comments," 6 [September 1992], 4; 7 [December 1992], 6) responds to Freeman's and Ogle's articles by arguing for "a simple account, specifying cloth texture and color, and describing the design [in words]." Bibliographers who wish to place individual designs in a broader his- torical context have a number of well-illustrated sources to turn to. Al- though the leading American historian of publishers' bindings, Sue Allen , did not live to produce the comprehensive work she had planned, her publications are always worth seeking out (some are not easy to locate). Especially helpful are her Victorian Bookbindings: A Pictorial Survey (1972, 1976), with its succinct history and 241 illustrations on microfiche,and American Book Covers 1830–1900 (1998), an accordion-folded brochure that includes a time-line and twelve photographs of grains. (She also wrote an essential article, "Machine-Stamped Bookbindings, 1834–1860," which includes a list of American binders' signatures, for the March 1979 issue of Antiques ,pp. 564–572.) The equivalent of a time-line is provided by the "Keys to Identifying Covers" ofeach decade from the 1830 s to the 1890 s in Calvin P. Otto's Onlyin Cloth (1998). Other books with many excellent illustrations are Eleanore Jamieson , English Embossed Bindings, 1825–1850 (1972); Ruari McLean , Victorian Publishers' Book-Bindings in Cloth and Leather (1973); Ellen K. Morris and Edward S. Levin , The Art of Publishers' Bookbindings, 1815–1915 (2000); and Edmund M. B. King , Victorian Decorated Trade Bindings, 1830–1880 : A Descriptive Bibliography (2003). One other work that should be men- tioned, even though it contains few illustrations, is Robert Lee Wolff's five-volume Nineteenth-Century Fiction: A Bibliographical Catalogue (1981–86), simply because it provides such a large sampling of books with binding descriptions (nearly eight thousand entries). Wolff says he was "guided by Sadleir's practices," and he generally does use Sadleir's names for grains. Illustrated studies of individual designers also exist: on Margaret Armstrong (by Charles Gullans and John Espey , 1991), for example, or on John Feely (by Sue Allen in a 1994 Clark Library pamphlet, Decorated Cloth in America ), on Frank Hazenplug and Sarah Whitman (by Gullans in the same pamphlet), and on Alice C. Morse (by Mindell Dubansky , 2008). Samples of the work of nineteen designers are listed (but not illustrated) in an exhibition catalogue from California State University at Fullerton, Decorative Approach to Trade Cloth Book Binding (1979). When describing the ornamental designs stamped on grained cloth for individual editions, bibliographers should be aware of a small number of bindings, used for only about a decade after 1835, in which the cover and spine designs were embossed on the cloth before it was fastened to the boards and spine strip rather than (as was usual) being stamped on the cloth after it was attached. (Embossed designs rise in relief from the surface, whereas stamped designs are pressed below the surface.) Because the embossed designs were placed on the cloth in advance, the positioning of the cover and spine elements obviously determined the size of book- block that could be accommodated; sometimes when the match was not exact, the designs are off-center on the finished book. These bindings are discussed, and thirteen designs illustrated, by Andrea Krupp and Jennifer Woods Rosner in "Pre-Ornamented Bookcloth on Nineteenth-Century Cloth Case Bindings" ( Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 94 [2000], 176–196). When one encounters a binding of this kind, one should compare it with the Krupp-Rosner illustrations; and if it is different, one should report it, in order to increase the inventory of the relatively small number of such designs. (Occasionally an embossed designwas applied to the cloth on an assembled binding case, but those instances can be identified by the factthat the intaglio plate flattens the cloth grain and thus leaves an edge mark.) My 1970 essay also covered the patterns of marbled papers, used both for covering binding boards and for endpapers. Because every piece of hand-marbled paper is unique, any matching that a bibliographer does can only be approximate (no matter how large the sample), and the twelve illustrations I provided, divided into two classes and given their tradi- tional names, are perhaps sufficient (along with my suggestions for addi- tional verbal modifiers). But if one wishes to make comparisons against a larger selection, one should turn to Richard J. Wolfe's great book, Marbled Paper: Its History, Techniques, and Patterns (1990), which contains (following p. 186) one hundred ninety-two excellent color illustrations, each assigned a number and (in a supplementary list) a name (the same traditional name I had used, with many alternatives and with useful historical notes). In- stead of attempting a classification of patterns, Wolfe arranges the samples according to "their development and manufacture in various geographi- cal locations," and thus types of patterns are not kept together. But the advantage is that the bibliographer who uses these samples in conjunc- tion with Wolfe's discussion of them (in "The Evolution of Marbled Pat- terns," pp. 179–192) has a basis in some instances for the approximate dating of papers. Although that possibility is obviously most useful in connection with pre-1820 books (before the period of publishers' bind- ings), nineteenth-century publishers did often make editions available si- multaneously in cloth and in "half-calf" with marbled covers, which can be difficult to identify. In any case, the wide availability of the Wolfe book (along with its unquestionable authority) makes it an appropriate refer- ence for bibliographers to cite when describing marbled paper. Other sets of color illustrations of marbled patterns have been pub- lished (usually in conjunction with marbling instructions), but none comes close to Wolfe as a source. For instance, there are forty-six pages of marbled specimens in Anne Chambers , The Principal Antique Patterns of Marbled Papers (1984); fourteen good color photographs of "very basic patterns" in Iris Nevins , Traditional Marbling (1985, 1988), photographs that are also included in her catalogues of papers available for sale; ninety-three pages of illustrations in Barry McKay , Patterns and Pigments in English Marbled Paper (1988); and sixty-seven large color illustrations in Einen Miura , The Art of Marbled Paper (1988; trans. 1991). Attempts at classification are less common. Phoebe Jane Easton has a chapter on "Nomenclature of Marbled Patterns" in Marbling: A History and a Bibli- ography (1983)—reprinted in Ink &amp; Gall , 7.2 (Winter 1993), 7–9—which summarizes my system. The same issue of Ink &amp; Gall also includes Carina Greven's "The Development of a Standard Nomenclature for Marbled Paper" (pp. 10–13), which includes a classification based on the "evolv- ing nomenclature" developed by the Belgian-Dutch Bookbinding Society. This system, however, simply enumerates seven types of patterns, in over- lapping categories: (1) pebble or stone; (2) drawn (using a tool), subdivided into ten patterns, such as curl, feather, and peacock; (3) combed (actually a type of "drawn"); (4) shadow (or "Spanish"), usually made on pebble (and when not, they fall into the sixth group); (5) fantasy (either abstract or pictorial); (6) combination (of two or more patterns); and (7) overmarble (marbled more than once). The object here is not primarily to provide a classification scheme (and this is not a satisfactory one) but rather to establish an international terminology (with equivalents in several lan- guages listed). This project is now fully reported in Elly Cockx-Indestege, Sierpapier &amp; Marmering: Ein Terminologie voor het beschrijven van Sierpapir en Marmering als boekbandversiering (1994). In addition to marbled paper, nineteenth-century publishers often used floral-patternedpapers for endpapers, and the basic article on this subject is Sue Allen's "Floral-Patterned Endpapers in Nineteenth-Century American Books" ( Winterthur Portfolio , 12 [1979], 183–224). Allen divides the patterns into eighteen categories (which go beyond the strictly floral): (1) seaweeds; (2) maidenhair fern and related designs; (3) sprigs and tiny bouquets; (4) small flowers and leaves connected by stems; (5) tightly fitted flowers and leaves; (6) large, realistically drawn flowers; (7) large, real- istically drawn flowers showing depth and volume; (8) "Eastlake" style (rigidly stylized) flowers; (9) small geometrics; (10) mechanical and imita- tive; (11)designs on two axes; (12) Renaissance style (scrolled or curling leaves, sometimes with flowerheads or coiling tendrils); (13) publishers' initials and trademarks and similarly organized units; (14) oriental mo- tifs and arrangements; (15) fairy-tale patterns; (16) butterflies and birds; (17) typefounders' combination borders; and (18) "modern" explosive de- signs. (The two most commonly used styles werenumbers 4 and 8.) She then provides seventy-seven illustrations (including examples of all eigh- teen categories) and a "Catalog of Selected Nineteenth-Century Ameri- can Endpapers," which contains comments on each of the illustrations (plus a list of the binders represented). Bibliographers would do well to key their endpaper descriptions to her illustrations, as a way of indicating the general style of pattern and placing it in a larger context. But they may also wish to supply their own illustrations. An example of a bibliography that provides illustrations of decorated papers—in this case twenty-two of those used by Knopf on covers—is Richard J. Schrader's bibliogra- phy of Mencken (1998). Books that display decorated papers—such as Annette Hollander's Decorative Papers and Fabrics (1971), Henry Morris's Roller-Printed Paste Papers for Bookbinding (1975), and Decorated Paper Designs … from the Koops-Marcus Collection (which includes some wonderful full- page illustrations of marbled patterns; 1997, in the Pepin Press's delightful "Design Series")—are not of particular use to descriptive bibliographers unless they show close relatives of the papers being described. The whole range of decorated paper (however produced) is concisely classified by Henk J. Porck in "Characterization of Western Handmade Decorated Papers: Development of a Standard Terminology" (in Looking at Paper: Evidence &amp; Interpretation , ed. John Slavin et al. [2001], pp. 196– 201), where six categories are outlined: monochrome (dyed in the pulp or painted), metal (gold or silver), marbled, paste, block-printed, and relief- printed (embossed). Because my 1970 essay, besides dealing with patterns, includes (near the end of the first section) asample of a complete binding description, I wish to call attention to a feature of the binding process not mentioned there: the pencil marks that frequently appear near the beginning and/ or end of the printed gatherings. Collectors and bibliographers have of- ten noticed them, but they have rarely been commented on—though Roger E. Stoddard included an illustration of one in Marks in Books, Il- lustrated and Explained (1995). His item 10 (p. 9) shows what he calls a "binder's mark"—in this case a "4" penciled in the gutter at the foot of the last page of the penultimate gathering. The first person to investigate such pencil marks in detail is Robert J. Milevski , who reported on them (with illustrations) in "Marks in Nineteenth-Century Trade Bindings" ( The Book Collector , 60 [2011], 41–56). He identified two categories: "sew- er's marks," which usually appear in the bottom margin of the last page of the last gathering (or the last page of an inserted publisher's catalogue); and "production marks," which usually appear in the lower margin (or sometimes one of the side margins) of the first page of the second, third, and/or fourth gatherings. In both cases, they take the form of a letter, a number, or a squiggle. Their exactfunction is not clear, but Milevski offers some possibilities: those at the end could identify the person who did the sewing and/or indicate that the job was satisfactorily completed; those at the beginning could identify the collator and/or signify that all gatherings were in order and any insertions were in place. More will be learned about them as more are reported and examined; and bibliogra- phers should note them in their binding descriptions, just as they would naturally mention that better known kind of evidence of the binding op- eration, the binder's ticket (with specific copies indicated as sources in both cases). Milevski observes that the pencil marks are "direct evidence of the human hand in the mass production of books in this era" (p. 47); as such, they deserve to be recorded for further study. Jackets My comments on the rationale and procedure for including dust- jacket descriptions in a descriptive bibliography were first published as the third section (pp. 109–115) of "Book-Jackets, Blurbs, and Bibliogra- phers" in The Library , 5th ser., 26 (1971), 91–134; they were supplemented on pp. 58–60 of "Dust-Jackets, Dealers, and Documentation" in Studies in Bibliography , 56 (for 2003–04 [2006]), 45–140. These discussions were reprinted, with slight revisions, in my Book-Jackets: Their History, Forms, andUse (2011), pp. 24–30 and 43–46. Two recent descriptive bibliogra- phies that can be singled out for their careful descriptions (and photo- graphs) of jackets are David Supino's Henry James (2006, 2014) and David Alan Richards's Kipling (2010). For others, see "Introduction to the Field" above, showing that jackets are now receiving much more attention than they once did. Another indication is Paola Puglisi's Sopraccoperta (2003); and in 2016 Mark R. Godburn published Nineteenth-Century Dust-Jackets , a narrative history that contains many more illustrations of nineteenth- century jackets than I provided and deals more fully than I did with con- tinental Europe and with unprinted jackets. Among the kinds of boxes in which books have been published are those that take shapes related to the subject matter of the books. Eugene Umberger has recently studied this phenomenon by writing about books on tobacco housed in such forms as cigar or cigarette boxes (see "Detachable Book Coverings (That Aren't Dust-Jackets)," The Book Collector , 65 [2016], 91–98). My 2011 book includes a list of almost 2000 examples of pre-1901 Brit- ish and American publishers' book-jackets, boxes (slip-cases, boxes with lids, etc.), and other detachable coverings for books (such as envelopes or overall wrappings). It is limited to items that have printed text or deco- ration on them, and the bulk of the entries give some indication of the extent and nature ofthe printed matter. My list was not intended to be a census but simply to report the examples I had learned about during the previous four decades. It is extensive enough, however, to give an idea of the growth in the use of book-jackets during the nineteenth century. And it has a practical usefulness for descriptive bibliographers: they can consult it as an initial indication of which publishers were using jackets at a given time, and for what kind of books, as a way of gauging whether the particular books they are describing were likely to have been published in jackets or boxes. If any of those books themselves happen to be pres- ent in my list, the bibliographer will thenknow where to find a copy in a jacket or box (when my source was an institutional library) or at least can be sure that a jacket or box once existed (when my source was a dealer's catalogue or private collection). Since the publication of my book, a large number of additional ex- amples have been reported tome (and some further ones are listed in the appendixes to Godburn's book); I hope that they will eventually form a supplementary list posted on the website of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, thus increasing the body of evidence on which bibliographers can draw. The University of Virginia Library itself now holds by far the largest collection of pre-1901 jackets: in 2014 it pur- chased the collection of the dealer Tom Congalton (the largest collection reported in my book), and two years later it bought the second collection that Congalton formed, bringing the total of its holdings to well overa thousand volumes. Every bibliographer who is describing a book from the 1830s onward (or indeed one ofthe annuals or children's books from the preceding decades) should make an effort to find out whether it originally appeared in a jacket or box and, if so, to locate such a copy. ARRANGEMENT I discussed the considerations underlying the overall arrangement of a descriptive bibliography and the numbering of its entries in "The Arrangement of Descriptive Bibliographies" in Studies in Bibliography , 37 (1984), 1–38. The approach outlined there is displayed in practice in my "A Sample Bibliographical Description with Commentary," Studies in Bibliography , 40 (1987), 1–30. I wish to call particular attention here to my discussion of subedition in part I of the 1984 essay, for that concept is one of Bowers's most important contributions to descriptive bibliography and has not received the recognition it deserves. (I should add,however, that my ensuing comments on the role of geography in the organization of printing-publishing history does not conform with Bowers's view, a point I discussed in my 1975 essay on issue and state [see above].) The most significant post-1984 articles relevant to the subject of ar- rangement are two careful and thorough ones by Maura Ives . The first is "Descriptive Bibliography and the Victorian Periodical" ( Studies in Bibli- ography , 49 [1996], 61–94). My 1984 essay points out the illogic of giving full descriptions of an author's books and then simply listing that author's contributions to periodicals, since the latter may have been an equally important (or even more important) part of the author's career and since, in any case, periodicals are printed matter exhibiting the same character- istics and problems common to books. Ives discusses these points in detail and then goes over the few differences she sees between the description of a periodical and that of a book (such as the periodical's "dual existence": a self-contained individual number that is part of a larger unit). At the end she provides a sample description (of a single number of a periodical), which occupies slightly more than four pages of small type and includes a historical introduction, a title-page transcription, listings of contents, illustrations, and plates (with quasi-facsimile transcriptions), descriptions of paper, typography, and publisher's binding, and a record of copies examined. All this is handled in exemplary fashion, but it raises a serious practical question: is it realistic to expect such treatment of every number of a periodical in which an author appeared, unless the author contrib- uted to periodicals only a few times? However desirable such treatment would ideally be, it would normally increase bibliographers' work beyond what most bibliographers would regard as feasible, and it would lengthen the resultingbibliographies beyond what most publishers would be willing to consider. From a realistic point of view, an abbreviated form needs to be found—one that recognizes the importance of describing periodicals but does not require a full description of every relevant issue. One bibliography that takes a step in this direction is George Miller and Hugoe Matthews's Richard Jefferies (1993), in which periodical con- tributions are placed first, as the "A" section. The authors "believe this to be a more logical arrangement in a work of this kind, and one that is particularly appropriate in Jefferies' case," since Jefferies was "a literary journalist," half of whose lifetime book publications "were serialized in or collected from periodicals" (p. xviii). For a great many other writers, as Miller and Matthews suggest, periodical contributions precede book publications, and one could argue that placing them first in a bibliogra- phy would frequently be appropriate. In any case, Miller and Matthews have clearly taken periodicals seriously, and they describe their plan for recording periodical contributions as follows: The entries are listed chronologically under the periodical titles which are in al- phabetical order. Information about the journal itself, the type of publication, fre- quency of issue, subject matter and editorial policy, proprietor, publisher and printer, editor(s) while Jefferies contributed to it, format, price, etc. is given first. In the entries that follow as full a reference aspossible is given, including issue number and month or day of issue—points often obscured by rebinding. The text of all items is compared with that of their subsequent printing in book form, and any changes incontent or the extent of any revisions are noted. The contents of all items not subsequently printed in book form are summarized. Any information from documentary or other sources relating to specific items is given under them, while at the end of each title there are notes on the background to Jefferies' association with the journal and on any possible untraced or unconfirmed contributions toit. (p. xix) One might object that the only element of physical description here is "format," which turns out to be simply the leaf dimensions. Neverthe- less, these bibliographers have shown admirable independence of mind and have demonstrated one reasonable scheme for handling periodicals: providing a general account ofa periodical first, followed by abbreviated entries for the subject's contributions to it. The number of details in the general account and in the entries could be increased or lessened depend- ing on the situation and the bibliographer's inclination. Thus the opening account could include notes on typography and paper and a collation for- mula in cases where most numbers of a journal follow the same pattern, and variations in the cited issues could be briefly noted. Ives does not mention the Jefferies bibliography, but perhaps she had it in mind when she said that describing a single number of a periodical is not sufficient. The Miller-Matthews plan, however, does offer a respon- sible, and easily adjustable, approach. In my 1984 essay, I expressed the hope that full-length descriptive bibliographies of individual periodicals might eventually be published, with the result that bibliographers of au- thors would only need to cite thosedescriptions. But such bibliographies are not likely to be produced soon, or in quantity, and author bibliogra- phers will have to find realistic solutions. The important thing is for bibli- ographers of authors to recognize in the first place that a problem indeed exists and that they must think creatively about the best way to deal with it in each particular situation. (The so-called degressive principle, which is what is involved here, is discussed in the last part of section II of my essay and more recently—but only in connection with enumerative bib- liographies—in D.W. Krummel's Bibliographies: Their Aims and Methods [1984] pp. 46–47, 63–64.) Ives's second article is "The Place of Musical Settings in Author Bib- liographies, with Examples from Christina Rossetti " ( Papers of the Biblio- graphicalSociety of America , 108 [2014], 5–39). Its most helpful parts are its commentary on constructingentries for musical settings (pp. 27–31) and its listing of relevant scholarship (pp. 33–39). The former calls at- tention to features that could be recorded in addition to the standard factsof printing and publishing history—features such as vocal range, instrumentation, initial key signatures and tempo notations, and plate numbers. (She also mentions reviews of performances, but these would be within scope only if secondary critical writings, such as reviews of the author's books, were included elsewhere in the bibliography.) The record of scholarship includes bibliographies that report musical settings, indexes to songs in collections, sources for music-publishing history (especially two admirable works, D. W. Krummel and Stanley Sadie's Music Printing and Publishing [1990] and Krummel's The Literature of Music Bibliography [1992]), and significant library collections. The rest of the article, for the most part, states the obvious. Ives feels that unless an author bibliography gives an explanation for the presence of music entries, it will usually be "impossible for users of these bibliographies to understand why musicis included" (p. 20). But appearances of poems in sheet music, hymnals, mu- sic collections, and so on are simply instances of the printing or reprinting of particular poems, and entries for them would be expected in an author bibliography as part of an author's publication history. Such entries help to document a work's textual history and its reputation and influence, as Ives notes, but they do not differ in that respect from all other entries. Whether musical settings should be recorded in a separate section is dis- cussed in some detail; and although Ives believes that such segregation is "almost always preferable" (sometimes with subdivisions), she recognizes that situations must be evaluated individually. If many bibliographers will not need a large part of the instructions offered here, Ives's discussions are nevertheless sensible, and some of them provide suggestive reading for anyone engaged in defining the content and placement of entries for music in an author bibliography. The last paragraph of a description, the record of copies examined, is discussed briefly in my essay (in the fifth paragraph from the end), in order to emphasize the distinction between the numbering of specific copies for reference within a description and the numbering of the entries themselves, which of course does not refer to individual copies. The post- publication features of books that can be reported under"Copies Exam- ined" include inscriptions, annotations, bookplates, and custom bindings. For help in pursuing clues regarding provenance, the best guide is David Pearson's Provenance Research in Book History (1994); for the identification and description of custom bindings, see the references mentioned under "Publishers' Bindings" above. Extensive provenance notes are illustrated in Anthony James West's "A Model for Describing Shakespeare First Folios, with Descriptions of Selected Copies" ( The Library , 6th ser., 21 [1999], 1–49); and a large collection of such notes (from the same proj- ect) can be found in Eric Rasmussen et al., The Shakespeare First Folios: A Descriptive Catalogue (2012). One post-publication feature that is not often thought about is dis- cussed by Jeffrey Todd Knight in "Invisible Ink: A Note on Ghost Im- ages in Early Printed Books"( Textual Cultures , 5.2 [2010], 53–62). Knight is speaking of offsets from adjacent items bound together (not from the printing process, which would be reported elsewhere in the description); such offsets provide useful evidence for the history of collecting and read- ing (as do many other post-publication additions to books). The impor- tance of the "Copies Examined" paragraph cannotbe exaggerated, not only because it records the sources for the description (enough reason in itself) but also because it fittingly completes the account by reflecting the post-publication life of those artifacts. ERRORS IN THE MALORY ARCHETYPE: THE CASE OF VINAVER'S WIGHT AND BALAN'S CURIOUS REMARK by RALPH NORRIS THE text of Sir Thomas Malory's Morte Darthur is based upon two authoritative witnesses: the Winchester Manuscript and the incunable printed by Wil- liam Caxton in 1485. 1 Scholarship, primarily by Eugène Vinaver , has established beyond reasonable doubt that the two versions descend from a common arche- type rather than one from the other and that the arche- type was not Malory's own autograph. 2 This situationallows textual scholars to reconstruct more of Malory's exact words from the errors and interference that are an inescapable part of the transmission of medieval romance than would otherwisebe possible. 3 Not only does each witness allow for a check upon the other, but in conjunction with Malory's sources they can at times allow scholars to correct the archetype and glimpse the exemplar that must lie beyond it. 1. The manuscript is now British Library MS Additional 59678; the British Library refers to it as the Malory Manuscript. It lacks its first and last gatherings and three other leaves. Caxton's first edition survives in two copies: a perfect copy owned by the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York and one wanting eleven leaves in the John Rylands University Library in Manchester, England .

Press, 1947, rev. 1948; 2nd ed. 1967, rev. 1973; 3rd ed. rev. P. J. C. Field 1990), c-cxxxi. For a discussion of subsequent chal- lenges to Vinaver's conclusion, see P. J. C. Field, "The Earliest Texts of Malory's Morte Darthur ," Poetica 37 (1993): 18-31, reprinted in Malory: Texts and Sources (Cambridge: D. S. Brewer , 1998), 1-13; further citations to this article will be to the reprinted version. 3. Although this is no longer seen as the only priority of the editor of medieval texts, it remains a legitimate goal: see Nicolas Jacobs , "Kindly Light or Foxfire? The Authorial Text Reconsidered," A Guide to Editing Middle English , ed. Vincent P. McCarren and Douglas Moffat (Ann Arbor: Univ. of Michigan Press, 1998), 3-14, on 12-13. The cases discussed below show that the scribe of the archetype occasionally misread his exemplar. One has long been familiar to Malory scholars from the introduction to Vinaver's magisterial editions; the other is a more recent contri- bution to Malory studies.However, neither scholar seems to have come as close as possible to the reading of the exemplar of the archetype, and the new critical edition by P. J. C. Field retains Vinaver's readings atthese points. 4 Although no such textual problem can ever be solved with certainty, probable solutions can be found that create clauses much more characteristic of Malory's usual style and that, therefore, are more likely to take us a little closer to the ideal of recovering Malory's exact words. I In addition to being Malory's most important twentieth-century editor, Eu- gène Vinaver was a significant exponent of the theory of editing medieval lit- erature that is associated with his mentor, Joseph Bédier . This theory calls for an editor to choose a single manuscript, the best manuscript so far as it can be determined, and only to emend manifest errors and readings that could not possibly be correct. 5 Because ofthis, Vinaver's three-volume edition The Works of Sir Thomas Malory took a conservative approach towards emendation of the text. This edition is based upon the Winchester Manuscript but also uses the Caxton to fill Winchester's lacunae and to shed light on various textual cruces. Furthermore, despite his allegiance to Bédier's motto , conserver le plus possible, réparer le moins possible , 6 Vinaver was, to his credit, willing to recognize a number of occasions that seemed to demand conjectural emendations, that is to say, emendations to the text that produce readings that are not found in either me- dieval witness. 7 One of the more notable examples of this kind of emendation occurs in the "Book of Sir Tristram " section. Because this error is the basis for Vinaver's argu- ment that the archetype of Winchester and the Caxton was not Malory's origi- nal autograph, he discusses it at length in the introduction to his edition: "The following sentence in Caxton, totally unintelligible as it stands, but reproduced without comment by all modern editors, should suffice to prove this." 8 4.

And the meane whyle word came vnto sir Launcelot and to sir Trystram that sire Carados the myghty kynge that was made lyke a gyaunt / that fought with sir Gawayn and gaf hym suche strokes that he swouned in his sadel / and after that he took hym by the coller / and pulled hym oute of his sadel / and fast bounde hym to the sadelbowe / and so rode his wey with hym toward his castell / 9 Vinaver asserts: This reading is the result of two mistranscriptions: the words made lyke a gyaunt that are clearly a corruption of some such phrase as made lyke a gyaunt whyght (or whycht ); some early scribe, mistaking the final t for e , made whyght (or whycht ) into whyche , and a later redactor, probably Caxton himself, changed whyche to that . The first of these two errors is found in the Winchester MS.; hence it must have occurred in the common source of our texts, and this source (X) could not, therefore, have been Malory's own manuscript. 10 The reading of Vinaver's edition is, therefore, And meanewhyle worde com to sir Launcelot and to sir Trystramys that kynge Carados , the myghty kynge that was made lyke a gyaunte which&lt;t&gt;, fought wyth sir Gawayne and gaff hym suche strokys that he sowned in his sadyll. 11 Vinaver makes fought into the verb of the main clause ratherthan of a subordinate clause, thus producing a complete sentence, and this resolves one of the three differences in wording between the two versions. Field endorses this reading with a small change in the spelling of wyght and a further emendation that will be discussed below. However, brilliant as this proposed solution is, it is unlikely to be correct. In the first place, Malory is not likely to have used the word giant as an adjective, as Vinaver's emendation would require. Nowhere else in the Morte Darthur does Malory use giant in this way. 12 Nor is it probable that Malory used the word wight to refer to Carados . Malory certainly knew this word in its noun form, referring to a person or being; however, it is not an active part of his vocabulary. Infact, it appears only once elsewhere in the Morte Darthur , in the Roman War section, in which the narrator describes the giant of Mont Saint Michel as "the foulyst wyghte that ever man sye" (157.9). 13 In this instance, Malory was probably in- fluenced by his source, which for the Roman War section is the alliterative Morte Arthure . Although the sole surviving manuscript of this poem does not contain this word at the corresponding place, it appears at a slightly earlier point: an old lady whom Arthur encounters curses the giant saying "Weryd worthe þe wyghte." 14 Defenders of Vinaver might concede the influence of the poem in this case but argue that this use of wight supports the idea that Malory used it to describe 9.

Another nuance of English seems to have escaped the multilingual Vinaver in a similar way: see Terence McCarthy , "Did Morgan le Fay Have a Lover?" Medium Ævum 60.2 (1991): 284-289. 13.

Carados , who was made like a giant. However, despite the fairly large number of giants and huge knights in the Morte Darthur , Malory never selects this word elsewhere. Nor does his source for the section containing the passage in question, the prose Tristan , seem to contain anything that would suggest this reading. Although no form of wight could be expected in an Old French text,one of the interesting aspects of Malory's adaptation of his sources is his tendency to choose English words that sound like words of different meanings in his source. 15 Vinaver's argument would be much stronger, therefore, if Malory's source con- tained a word with a similar sound that might have brought this rarely-used word to Malory's mind. The editio princeps of the prose Tristan is based upon a manuscript that is very close to Malory's source, 16 and at the equivalent point in the story, it calls Carados , "vng geant que on appelloit karadoes le sire de la douloureuse tour." 17 The semantic range of wight could include geant , but Malory always uses the English derivative for this word, as he does here as well. There- fore, because neither Malory's normal usage nor the source suggest it, the odds seem to be against Malory's actually using the word wight in this passage. If Vinaver's emendation is therefore rejected, we return to the question of what Malory actually wrote. Since Vinaver first proposed this idea, several other editions of the Morte Darthur in addition to Field's have appeared that contain the passage in question, yet, despite their many differences, these editions, by Janet Cowen , James Spisak , Helen Cooper , and Stephen Shepherd , all agree in their solution to this problem. Their texts each read, "Carados …that was made like a giant fought with Sir Gawain ," 18 thus removing the relative pronoun that Vinaver believed had originally been wight . This is a sensible solution. It produces a clear, intelligible reading at the priceof removing a single word, and the reading thus created could not differ greatly from the meaning that Malory had intended. 19 This solution seems to imply that arrhythmia had caused the scribe of the archetype to intrude an unwanted word into his copy. Arrhythmia, however, is generally a hypothesis of last resort, so we should try to exhaust all other possibilities before reaching this conclusion. In fact, looking at the context suggests something besides an isolated error. Vinaver's solution was characteristically ingenious, and the way he presented it makes it seem even more so. In his introduction he creates the impression, though without doubt inadvertently, that the two witnesses have only one sig- 15. This is amply attested in the apparatus to both Vinaver's and Field's editions. 16.

Cowen notes Vinaver's emendation but without offering an opinion as to its cogency, 1: xxxviii. nificant difference, that and which , and that he has explained that difference and solved the unintelligibility of the passage at a stroke. However, comparison of the passage in the two versions shows that they have three differences of equal magnitude to the that / which discrepancy. In the Winchester, the passage reads: And [___] meane whyle worde com to sir launcelot &amp; to Sir Trystramys that kynge Ca- rados the myghty kynge that was made lyke a gyaunte whyche fought wyth Sir Gawayne and gaff hym suche strokys þ t he sowned in his sadyll &amp; aft er þ t he toke hym by þ e coler &amp; pulled hym oute of his sadyll &amp; bounde hym faste to the sadyll bowȝe &amp; so rode his way w t hym towarde his castell. 20 Again, the Caxton version: And the meane whyle word came vnto sir Launcelot and to sir Trystram that sire Carados the myghty kynge that was made lyke a gyaunt / that fought with sir Gawayn and gaf hym suche strokes that he swouned in his sadel / and after that he took hym by the coller / and pulled hym oute of his sadel / and fast bounde hym to the sadel bowe / and so rode his wey with hym toward his castell / 21 These discrepancies seem to show that the process that created them was more complex than any single mistake. If we take these discrepancies one at a time, the following suggests itself. Malory probably wrote "And the meane whyle" rather than "And meane whyle." In the 67 instances of his use of meanwhyle , Malory always precedes it with the , or, in thirteen cases, this , except for the possibility of this disputed case. The next discrepancy involves whether he wrote "Sir Carados " or " King Carados ." The fact that the phrase "the mighty king" follows in both versions argues in favor of sir , since it is unlikely that Malory would feel the need to qualify "King Carados" by explaining that he was a mighty king. 22 Probably, therefore, Malory wrote Sir Carados as he sometimes did, and the Winchester scribe, who was more accus- tomed to seeing this name preceded bythe royal title and whose eye may have caught the word king in close proximity, made a mistake. This mistake would be the easier for a scribe to make because in the Morte Darthur there are three characters with this name. 23 The Carados of this scene, brother of Sir Tarquin and lord of the Dolorous Tower, is not said to be a king except in this episode, and in this episode, according to the Winchester, Carados is called "King Carados" twice and "Sir Carados" four times. 24 In the Caxton, he is referred to only as "Sir Carados." 25 Again excluding this disputed instance, Malory refers to a characterby this name 36 times, 12 as "Sir Carados " and 24 times as "King Carados ," and before this instance, the statistics are 12 and six respectively. This fact shows that the scribe would be twice as likely to have 20. The Winchester Malory , f. 173 r . Underlined passages stand for discrepancies between Winchester and the Caxton. 21.

Although Malory does once introduce "Kyng Anguyshaunce, the kynge of Irelonde" (274.17), defining a king's domain is not the same as merely reiterating a king's royalstatus, even with the added information that he was a great king. 23.

There is some evidence that both may have happened. In 1498 Caxton's successor, Wynkynde Worde , printed a new edition of the Morte Darthur , and recently de Worde has been shown to have occasionally used Caxton's exemplar to supplement Caxton's copy. 27 Surprisingly, this may, in fact, be the case for this page as well: de Worde's edition deviates from the Caxton in eight instances on this page, and of those instances Winchester agrees with de Worde fourtimes and with the Caxton three. 28 None of the variations is very great, and all of them together might be coincidence. If so they are de Worde's personal variation and have no bearing on the issue, yet if they are not, then de Worde's edition gives our conclusions some support. One of the correlations between Winchester and the de Worde involves Ca- rados. In the passage under discussion, de Worde agrees with the Caxton against Winchester in calling Carados Sir Carados the mighty king ; however, the de Worde and Winchester both call this character King Carados against the Caxton's Sir Carados when they refer to him next. If de Worde were following Caxton's copy text for this page rather than the Caxton itself, it would confirm the conclusions reached above. 29 Now we must account for the grammatical mistake that led Vinaver to draw attention to this passage in the first place and answer the question of the relative pronoun. Both versions agree that there is a relative pronoun, and, therefore, either "which fought with Sir Gawain ," "that fought with Sir Gawain " or a phrase with a word that a scribe could mistake for one of the two must have been in the exemplar of the archetype. That appears far more often in the Morte Darthur than which , at 8,426 occurrences to only 158 respectively. 30 In both previous instances, we have seen that if the argument is sound the advantage goes to the Caxtonver- sion, suggesting perhaps some problem with the exemplar of the Winchester or with the attention of the scribe. 31 Together these facts argue in favor of that; how- ever, Vinaver was probably right to say that Malory did not write either one. 26.

See Vinaver , Introduction, Works , c-cvi. Vinaver's hypothesis of intermediate copies has been challenged, but his idea receives support from Takako Kato , "Corrected Mistakes in the Winchester Manuscript," Re-viewing "Le Morte Darthur," ed. K. S. Whetter and Raluca L. Ra- dulescu (Cambridge: D. S. Brewer , 2005), 9-25. Now see the introduction to Field's edition. The construction of the passage in question as preserved by its two witnesses contains multiple subordinate clauses, one embedded into another, and this is very unusual for Malory. Although one could not say that Malory never uses subordinate clauses, paratactic constructions of simple clauses joined by coor- dinating conjunctions, usually and or but , are much more common. 32 Of course, this very fact might account for Malory occasionally losing his way when creating a clause with a complex construction, yet any rational solution that removed a double subordination would have some inherent plausibility. The alternatives suggested by textual criticism are misreading and internal contamination, that is reminiscence of words already written or anticipation of those later on the page. Vinaver's attempt to restore the passage posits misread- ing, and in this respect Vinaver is clearly correct. Internal contamination occurs when, after looking away from the exemplar, the scribe resumes at the wrong point and introduces words from elsewhere on the page into his copy. Although it appears from the above that Vinaver failedto determine the exact misreading, there is no reason to suspect that the that (or possibly the which ) could have come from any other place on the page nearby. 33 The most likely solution is that the misread word was had . The exemplar of the archetype probably read, that Sir Carados the myghty kynge that was made lyke a gyaunte had fought wyth Sir Gawayne and gaff hym suche strokes that he sowned in his sadyll. The scribe of the ar- chetype would have misread had for þat . The scribe of the archetype would have taken the descender and front loop of the h for a þ , correctly read the a and then,perhaps already having the word that in mind, mistook the stroke of the d for that of a t . 34 There is evidence that the exemplar of the Caxton was irregular and hard to read, 35 and perhaps the exemplarof the archetype was as well. The Winchester scribe would then have altered that to which , and the Caxton compositor would have reproduced faithfully from his exemplar, which is in keeping with the accumulating evidence that the Caxton is the more accurate witness for this passage. This explanation is no more radical than the one Vinaver proposed. Al- though misreading þ for h is not a commonly recognized scribal error, neither is Vinaver's suggestion of misreading t for e . Moreover, this emendation is more plausible because it creates a clause more typical of Malory. The reading thus 32. Field, Romance and Chronicle 31-5, 38-46.

Brewer , 1993) 109-132. 33. See Morte Darthur , ed. Field, 333. 34. Another example of a d/t error may be found in Morte Darthur 15.9n: "he putteth these two kynges moost part to the werse," where the Caxton has " do the werse" (my emphasis). This error occurs during an lacuna in Winchester, so there is no way to know if this error derives from the archetype, but it demonstrates thatsuch errors did occur. 35.

This conjectural emendation also has some support from Malory's source. The relationship of Malory's writing to its sources can vary from almost literal translation to very free retelling within the same tale, butin this case, Malory seems to be working somewhere between these two extremes. The prose Tristan reads here, il [i.e. Gallehaut] estoit alle eu royaume de logres ou le roy artus auoit tenu court a londres a vne penthecouste et y auoit este vng geant que on appelloit karadoes le sire de la douloureuse tour / et celui par sa force auoit prins mo n seigneur gauuain et lauoit emporte. 36 Although Malory's version is clearly not anything like a direct translation, he is describing the same action. Therefore the French par sa force auoit prins could have led Malory to write had fought . One last point to consider before reaching our final conclusions about this passage is the emendation of "word com to sir Launcelot" to "word come to sir Galahalt" that P. J. C. Field introduced in his revision of Works . 37 Although Winchester and the Caxton agree on reading Launcelot , Field is almost certainly correct to emendas he does. If the reading of Launcelot were correct, the result would be a sequence of events conspicuous for being both oddly-narrated and implausible. Launcelotwould reenter the story for the first time since the end of "The Tale of Sir Gareth" to hear these tidings, apparently apart from Tristram, and then happen upon Carados and Gawain "by fortune" (333.15) before Cara- dos could bring Gawain to his castle. In a tale of wonder, plausibility can stretch far, and it istrue that we do not know what distance Carados had to travel with his captive, but the story gives us no reason to think that rumor is running faster than the hooves of Carados's horse. In this instance, Malory's sources are no help. The story is related very dif- ferently in the prose Tristan and in its own source, the prose Lancelot . In these versions, the action is narrated directly to the reader rather than through the intermediary of uninvolved characters hearing the news. Lancelot is present dur- ing the abduction and pursues Carados, but he is not able to free Gawain until after Carados has taken him to this dungeon. 38 Malory's story itself, however, shows that Field must be correct. The story of Gawain's abduction and rescue is told to Tristram and Galahalt at Galahalt's court before Tristram's departure. The story is framed on one side with the words quoted above and on the other with, "So this same tale was tolde to Sir Gala- halte and to Syr Trystrames, and Sir Galahalte sayde, 'Now may ye hyre the nobles that folowyth Sir Launcelot.'" 39 The episode, therefore, ends as it must 36.

The second Sir Galahalte itself is an emendation; see note. have begun, with Sir Galahalte and Sir Tristram hearing one of the innumerable stories of the nobility of Sir Launcelot, not with Launcelot and Tristram hearing the story of Gawain's abduction. Just how the error of Launcelot for Galahalt occured takes us to the limits of what scholarship can discover. Perhaps, as Field suggests, the mistake is a "men- tal echo caused by the preceding alternation of Sir Trystram and Sir Launcelot ," 40 or, to paraphrase Field in another connection, because authors do not always write what they intend, there must be a real possibility that Malory himself in- advertently wrote Launcelot . If so, the reading that Malory intended will have ex- isted only in Malory's mind until Field put it into print. 41 Or, finally, perhaps the scribe of the archetype was confused by seeing Tristram and Galahalt together immediately after Tristram was said to have taken his leave, 42 and if so, perhaps he made the change to try to restore sense. In any case, if the above arguments are sound then Malory's original should be, And [the] meanewhyle worde com to Sir Galahalt and to Sir Trystramys that [Sir] Carados the myghty kynge that was made lyke a gyaunte had fought wyth Sir Gawayne and gaff hym suche strokys that he sowned in his sadyll, and after that he toke hym by the coler and pulled hym oute of his sadyll and bounde hym faste to the sadyll bowȜe, and so rode his way with hym towarde his castell. 43 The possibility that the scribe of the archetype could misread one small word for another, and in particular misread the stroke of a d for a t may shed light on another small mystery of the archetype of Winchester and the Caxton. II In a study of corrected mistakes in Winchester, Takako Kato demonstrated that, contrary to the impressionone might get from the apparatus of Vinaver's edition, the Winchester scribes were not human automata , only reproducing their text accurately or making only unconscious errors. 44 They also sometimes noticed mistakes in their copy and tried to correct them. One of her examples comes from the story of Balin. Balin has recently been released from King Arthur's prison when he encounters his brother, Balan. The Winchester version records Balan'swords as follows: "I am ryȝt glad of your delyu er aunce and of youre dolerous p re sonment." 45 Kato rightly observes that the inclusion of the and makes nonsense of the passage, which certainly is why the scribe deleted it, 46 but that the same word appears without the correction in the Caxton: "I am ryght glad of your delyueraunce and of youre dolorous 40. .

However, as above, something must have led the scribe of the archetype to make this mistake. Here internal contamination can be ruled out, if not as swiftly as in the case above. It is true that the scribe of the archetype could possibly have been misled to write delyveraunce and by the words delyverde and which appear in the line below in Winchester and two lines below in the Caxton. 48 Yet if that were so he must have paused after delyveraunce , returned to his exemplar and found delyverde and resumed his copying but realized his mistake after writing the single word and . Then he must have returned to the correct place and continued without either adapting the wording to tidy up the mistake or even, like his successor of the Winchester manuscript, deleting the word. Such a situation would be most un- likely in a case of internal contamination. By way of comparison, to illustrate a more probable instance of internal contamination, consider thissimilarly illogical sentence from "The Tale of Sir Launcelot:" "Than Sir Launcelot made his complaynte unto the kynge, how he was betrayed, and how he was brother unto Sir Lyonell, whyche was departed frome hym he wyste not where" (197.34 – 198.1). This reading has been retained by every edition based upon the Winchester, nor has any editor commented on what appears to be an example of unintended humor: Launcelot complain- ing that he has recently been betrayed and also complaining that Lyonell is his brother. A look at the Caxton text illuminates how the Winchester scribe came most probably to produce this reading. The Caxton reads, "Anone syre launcelot made his complaynte vnto the kynge how he was bytrayed And how his broder syre lyonel was departed from hym / ne nyst not where /" 49 The Winchester scribe apparently committed an error of saut du même au même and returned to the first how in the phrase in the line above the one that he intended and recopied "he was," only realizing his mistake as he reached the word "betrayed." The scribe then altered the rest of the sentence to compensate, an example of what Field has called invisible mending. 50 The textual situation is different in the example from the story of Balin. Field believes that this is a case of an intruded and , which "W often and C and the archetype sometimes use … to cure textual difficulties, real and imaginary." 51 Given that the scribe ofthe archetype shared this tendency with his successor of the Winchester Manuscript, this is a neat solution to this mystery. However, it begs the question of what textual difficulty, an imagined one presumably, the scribe of the archetype might have thought he was solving by adding a word that destroys the sense of what he was copying. 47.

For a discussion of this phenomenon in Malory, see Field, Introduction, Morte Darthur , 1: xxxvi. 51. Field, ed. Morte Darthur , 2: 17, 18.30n. This note also includes a list of such intruded and s. A better solution is that the scribe of the archetype misread a word in his exemplar without realizing it, and the misread word would almost certainly be out . One can see easily how such a misreading could take place. Mistaking the loop of the o for an a , the scribe would naturally interpret the double minims of the u as an n , and finally mistake the stroke of the t for a d , the same error, in the opposite direction, as above. This hypothesis would produce as the reading of the archetype's exemplar, "I am ryght glad of youre delyveraunce out of youre doler- ous presonment." This reading is idiomatic, makes very good sense, and is typical of Malory's style. Malory never uses the word presonment other than this once, but he refers to knights' release (or otherwise) from prison fourteen times and always uses the construction oute of preson , never, say, merely delyverde of preson 52 The similarity of this misreading on the part of the scribe of the archetype to the misreading of had for þat is remarkable. In both cases short functional words, an auxiliary verb and a preposition, have been mistaken for another word, and both contain a similar d/t confusion. Each of the two cases provides supporting evidence for the validity of the other. III The effect of considering these cases together is to affirm both the importance and the dangers of conjectural emendation in editing Malory's text. Kato's article provides outstanding examples of how this principle can solve textual mysteries, and even Vinaver, a textual conservative, recognized its usefulness. Vinaver's intelligence and industry stand as an inspiration to all later Malory scholars. His grand editions remain monuments of twentieth-century scholar- ship and will doubtless continue to be the standard by which new editions of Malory's work will be measured. And as this article shows, his conclusionsabout the existence and nature of the archetype from which Winchester and the Caxton independently derive remain solid. However, in the cases discussed above, Vinaver appears to have been misled. In the instance from "The Book of Balin," Vinaver's theory of editing prevented him from considering the implications of the corrected mistake in his copy text: because the corrected reading was not impossible, he apparently did not give much thought to the fact that the Caxton contains the same mistake. 53 On the otherhand, his emendation to wight in "The Book of Tristram" section actually demonstratesa danger of conjectural emendation that Bédier and Vinaver sought to avoid with their best text system of editing. Perhaps swayed by the excitement brought about by examining the then newly-discovered Winchester manuscript with its promise of solutions to mysteries, Vinaver introduced into the standard edition of a major author an erroneous reading of his own creation. 54 52. Concordance , s. v. preson, presonment. 53. Vinaver notes the Caxton reading in his apparatus at the foot of the page, and he marks it with † to indicate that it is an inferior reading. 54. Walter Oakeshott , then a junior master, later Headmaster ofWinchester College, who discovered the Winchester manuscript was once similarly tempted to accept a Winchester reading when the Caxton was correct. Walter Oakeshott , "The Text of Malory," Times Literary Supplement , 27 September 1934; cf. Vinaver, Introduction, Works , cxv-cxvi. Of these two pitfalls, however, the narrowness of Vinaver's theory is the more harmful because it focusesattention away from the analysis of textual variants, which is indispensable to textual criticism. Vinaver'scaret brackets alert the reader to the hand of the editor. In all such cases the scholarly reader must judge the validity of the emendation, which will lead to progress either as confirma- tion or refutation. Yet the missing word in the story of Balin threated to vanish from all consideration into the tiny type at the bottom of the page until rescued by Kato's study, a small loss perhaps, but a distortion of a great author's syntax, nevertheless. Applying a less narrow theory of editing and possessing a greater appreciation of the critical importance of both major witnesses, we are in a posi- tion to continue to recover more of Malory's exact words than ever before. Field's new edition is a great step forward in this endeavor; it improves on Vinaver's text in a multitude of closely-reasoned variants. This paper argues for afew more in the ongoing effort to safeguard Malory's work from, as has been memorably put, time's wallet of oblivion. JAMES SHIRLEY'S TRIUMPH OF PEACE: ANALYZING GREG'S NIGHTMARE by STEPHEN TABOR THE surviving exemplars of James Shirley's Triumph of Peace ( London , 1633/4 ) have defeated the attempts of generations of bibliographers to classify them. Any two copies are likely to show some pages with identical typesettings, some with partly different settings, and some entirely different. The title page comes in four variants of authorship and edition statements (fig. 1): By James Shirley , of Grayes Inne, Gent. By James Shirley , Gent. By James Shirley , of Grayes-Inne, The third Impression. By James Shirley , of Grayes-Inne, Gent. The third Impression. These states have an obscure connection with the text pages that follow, whose dozens of permutations require one to specify the state of each page in or- der to fully characterize a copy. The normal hand-press taxonomy of edition, impression, issue, and state is inadequate to sort the copies into well-behaved families. As convoluted as The Triumph of Peace (henceforth "ToP ") may be, part of the reason for bibliographers' difficulty in coming to grips with it was the unavail- ability, until the 1960 s, of a technology that could supply quick and cheap repro- ductions of complete copies for thorough comparison. W. W. Greg, who came closer than anyone to understanding the book, died in 1959 , the year the Xerox machine was introduced. (He would have had to wait another half-century for the silent invasion of library reading rooms by digital cameras and smartphones.) In 1946 , he published a paper entitled "The Triumph of Peace: A Bibliographer's Nightmare". 1 His chief purpose there was to point out inconsistencies in the account of the work by William Jackson and Emma Unger in the Pforzheimer catalogue published several years earlier. 2 However, he concluded that "a final solution will have to wait till a bibliographer equipped with the necessary skill and patience finds the leisure and the opportunity to make a thorough scrutiny of all available copies." 3 The descriptions of ToP that Greg published five years later in his Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration showed no further 1.

The Triumph of Peace was a masque produced by the Inns of Court for the court of Charles I. It was conceived, fittingly, as a peace offering. In 1633 , William Prynne , a member of Lincoln's Inn, had published Histrio-mastix , a puritanical indictment of the theatre that, among a multitude of objections, criticized women for appearing on stage. Archbishop William Laud, looking for an excuse to si- lence Prynne, contrived to frame this as a personal attack on the Queen Consort Henrietta Maria , who was known occasionally to breach this barrier in private performances. Prynne was famously hauled into Star Chamber for sedition and sentenced to have his ears cropped, among other penalties. But he had dedicated his book to the Inns of Court, thus implicating his own professional organization in an act of lése majesté that, as both sides realized, called for a display of contrition. The barristers loosened their purse-strings, and the masque they offered is chiefly famous today—its bibliographical complexities apart—for being the most lavish production staged in England at least until the Restoration. Performed on 3 Fe- bruary 1634 , 7 it commenced with a very public torchlight procession from the Inns of Court down Chancery Lane and the Strand to Whitehall. The Venetian ambas- sador reported home, "Their display at the palace with a numerous, stately and 4.

Bentley repeats Unger and Jackson's assertion that two editions were worked off simultaneously in expectation of high sales, and cites a total press run of three thousand copies from Greg's article, where Greg had merely pulled that figure out of the air to illustrate a point. These conclusions were further embellished by Lawrence Venuti in Our Halcyon Dayes (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989 , p. 211): "even before it was performed, several thousand copies had been printed, and it went through several editions." 7. The book was dated according to the convention of the law courts, in which the year changed on Lady Day (25 March). glittering cavalcade, by their dresses, liveries and devices, attracted a great crowd, exciting the curiosity and applause of all the people ...". 8 The whole spectacle was funneled into the Banqueting House for the private performance featuring sets by Inigo Jones and music by William Lawes and Simon Ives . The result so pleased the Queen that Charles requested a second performance, at further expense to the lawyers (or perhaps this was his real motive), ten days later at Merchant Taylors' Hall. 9 This shift of venue entailed some hasty demolition and construction to clear an approach for the royal couple, and residents along the parade route were re- quired to mount torches on the front of their houses and provide security for the whole night. The combined cost of the two performances came to very roughly £20,000–at least $4 million today, by a conservative estimate. 10 Whatever the literary merits of Shirley's text, the extravagance and unusually public aspect of the productions created a heavy demand for the printed record, both within and without the court. 11 The book of the masque bears witness to this demand; the bibliographical evidence I present here will reveal a printing house running at full tilt, distracted by other jobs and grasping for short-cuts. The surviving financial accounts for the production of the masque record payments to a "Mr. Wakelye" (variously spelled), whom they call "the printer". 12 This was the publisher Thomas Walkley, who until at least 1632 had a shop in Britain's Burse , quite close to the Inns of Court. By early 1634 he had moved nearer to Whitehall, but he seems to have retained his connections to the legal community. Walkley sub-contracted the actual printing of ToP to John Norton , who had printed works by Jonson and Massinger for Walkley in the previous few years. And he entrusted the distribution of copies to William Cooke, who pub- lished all six of James Shirley's plays issued in 1632–35 and many more besides. 13 Cooke's shop at Furnival's Inn Gate was a nexus of literary activity associated with the Inns. Shirley himself lived near Gray's Inn, and on 17 January 1634– no doubt as part of his compensation for writing The Triumph of Peace —he was ad- mitted to honorary membership in the Inn as "one of the valets of the chamber of Queen Henrietta Maria , 'absque fine' ". 14 Three of the four title-page states of 8.

So, the production and distribution of the printed book was very much an inside job, carried out by men with close ties to the Inns of Court and their associated literary coteries.

Quire A describes the procession before the per- formance, and the decoration of the Banqueting Hall; quires B-D, with their own pagination sequence, contain the text of the masque. Four surviving cop- ies contain an additional singleton leaf of verse headed "A speech to the King and Queenes Maiesties, when they were pleased to honour the City with their presence, and gave a gracious command, the former tryumph should attend them." Its eighteen lines, delivered by a character called "Gen[ius].", allude to the masque's second performance on 13 February. THREE PUZZLES §1. Main Settings Table 1 shows, in shades of gray, the distribution in surviving copies of the completely different settings of each page. The rows of the table correspond to the copies or reproductions I have examined, grouped by the four title-page vari- ants which are separated by the horizontal white bands. The columns represent the pages of each copy grouped by quire and forme. One can immediately see what perplexed the earlier bibliographers. Some settings persist throughout the print history: the outer formes of quires A and C, for instance, and even the title page (a1r), remain substantially the same with relatively minor variants. Other pages go through as many as three settings. Most of the new settings do not line up with changes on the title page. The concept of "edition" as applied to the whole book, and the normal role of the title page as the primary taxo- nomic organizer, go out the window here. So does any hope of dealing with the book quirewise, or even formewise. Only a page-by-page analysis will allow us to specify the relationships among copies. As it happens, this patchwork of settings (taken in conjunction with the vari- ants they contain) works in our favor when we set out to put all the states, from major to minor, into chronological order. Let us take the example of quire A inner forme, where page A2r goes through two partial resettings, A1v gets one complete resetting, and the other two pages exhibit only stop-press corrections. In table 2, the heavy horizontal line separates the completely different settings of A1v, while the lighter lines separate partial resettings or more minor altera- tions. The relative positions of the lines between columns show the points of introduction of new states, either simultaneously with changes on other pages or independently from them. We have no immediate basis for deciding the order in which some of these occurred. However, since the forme is the basic unit of printing, these four pages must all live their lives in the same direction: a prov- able sequence of variants on one page imposes an obligation on the sequences of the others. A4r, in its single setting, shows progressive improvement in spelling and punctuation. In the first wave of correction, "sharpe sited" becomes "sharpe sighted" and "Caduseus" becomes "Caduceus". In the next wave, the addition of commas to a listing of architectural features helps to improve the sense. On A3v, the correction of "Arber-worke" to "Arbor-worke", occurring part-way through the second state of A4r, follows the same order. If we accept this sequence of states for these two pages, the other two (A1v and A2r) must follow suit. There- fore, setting 1 of both A1v and 2r does indeed come first, a fact that we would otherwise have difficulty proving. Setting 2 of A1v then goes through two waves of correction that lock partial resettings 2 and 3 of A2r into order. When, some twenty-five years ago, I began to sort through all of the states of ToP , I was pleas- antly surprised to find most of them clicking into place pretty readily in this same way. I have recorded the rationales for the order of states in appendix 1, though I would not encourage the reader to venture into that thicket quite yet. The important thing to note in table 1 (the table of editions of the whole book) is that there appears to be an orderly progression of settings of the constitu- ent sheets. The various settings of one quire do not mix randomly with settings of other quires. As the quire-breaks always fall at the same points in the text in all the states, copies could in theory have been assembled from sheets of what- ever combinations of settings were available at the gathering stage. The lack of random mixing implies discrete stages of production and collation, and provides one argument against the theory of simultaneous setting that has prevailed until now. Only the late states of quire D show a more promiscuous behavior; I will explain this in §8B. The title-page variants, though seeming to dance to their own drummer, at least dance in the same direction as the variants in quires A-D. In the earliest copies of the title (fig. 1[A]), the "O" in "OF" in line 3 is sound. A small accident soon dents the top of the O, and this damaged type persists through all of the subsequent states. Reassuringly, the "third impression" title pages are found only in copies having the latest states of the text, and we can see that the unique copy of title 3, with its dangling comma after "Grayes-Inne", is just an uncorrected version of title 4. Quire "a", therefore, shows a rational order of variants that also tracks the evolution of the other quires, even if the title-page changes are out of phase with those of the text pages. Although, after we become familiar with table 1, we discern some comforting regularities, we are left with the question of why some pages were reset and others were not. The mystery deepens when we look more closely at the pages which retain at least 50% of their original settings. TOP shows the normal pattern of stop-press corrections found in most books of the hand-press period. But we also encounter two phenomena which are unusual: (1) pages on which only the page number is reset, where no correction was required, and (2) pages on which blocks of text in a particular type style (usually italic) are reset—again with no substan- tive changes to the reading—while the other portions remain untouched. The seemingly capricious page-number resettings turn out to be a powerful tool for reconstructing the sequence of events in John Norton's shop during the printing of ToP. Once we understand what motivated them, we will be in a better TABLE 1. Distribution of completely different settings The three shades of gray indicate, from light to dark, one to three settings. Clear cells indicate missing leaves. No attempt is made here to show partial resettings. TABLE 2. Complete and partial resettings in forme A(i) position to interpret the equally puzzling replacement of blocks of text on some pages. §2. Headlines ToP contains no running titles. Except for the words "The Epistle" on a2v, the headlines consist of simple page numbers within parentheses—three or four types plus spacers. Figure 2 shows two states of a page (C1r) in which the headline has been reset. This is not just a spacing shift—all three printing characters are different types. But the setting below is unchanged, and even the direction lines are unaltered (both contain the catchword "An_" with a dropped hyphen). On some other pages, both the numbers and the direction lines show resetting— for example B3r in Houghton STC 22459 as compared with the same page in Houghton STC 22459a.5. Still others have page-number resettings in conjunc- tion with stop-press corrections. On A1v, Bodleian Mal. 160(3) has three errors that are corrected in National Art Library 25.c.79. 15 The priority seems clear. However, along with the corrections comes a reset page number: originally well printed, the "2" in the apparently later state is badly damaged and the left pa- renthesis prints much thinner than the right. The nature of the damage to the numeral makes it unlikely that we are looking at the same unhappy type, and the parentheses are also clear substitutions. In the act of improving the text, the printer seems for no discernible reason to have swapped out a good page number and substituted a bad one. Finally, a new headline always appears in those cases (mentioned in the pre- vious section and discussed more fully in the next) where selected blocks of text are reset seemingly without need. Headlines are reset even when they are not adjacent to the reset text. Huntington copies 69434 and 69428, for instance, show this phenomenon on C2v. Most of these headline replacements also entail a reset direction line, though the latter can be difficult to detect. Of the two features, I have found the page numbers to be a clearer first indicator that something unusual is going on, for 15. L. 11, colous/colours; ll. 20–21, Doubled/Doublet; l. 27, blcke/blacke. FIGURE 2. Headlines on page C1r of Huntington RB 69428 (top) and Huntington RB 69432. three reasons: unlike the catchwords, they are letter-spaced, and seldom the same way twice; their horizontal alignment with the first line of text is variable; and the numbers and parentheses in Norton's type-cases contain a variety of forms and damaged sorts that make substitution easy to detect. The page-number changes in ToP are so clearly without purpose that they must have been unintended consequences of other operations. We can explore their patterns by modifying table 1 to show where the substitutions occur. In table 3, the double horizontal lines indicate page-number changes. 16 These obviously occur also at the points where whole pages are reset (still shown by changing shades of gray), but others divide the main settings into smaller groups. A reset number on one page usually accompanies a similar operation on its forme-mates, and the table shows corresponding fault-lines that often break out of individual formes into whole quires and even to the other sheets. The initial impression of chaos in table 1 begins to yield to a pattern that is more complex, but also more orderly. The page numbers in ToP belong to an element common to most books of the hand-press period called the skeleton forme. This consisted of non-printing material such as the furniture that held the pages in a set layout on the press bed, but it also included the headlines and direction lines. The latter contained 16. I have ignored some anomalies in forme B(i) that will be discussed in §6C. In late copies of quire D, two settings occur interchangeably; therefore it is not possible to diagram a clear transition from one to the other. TABLE 3. Correlation of page number resettings with text resettings Heavy horizontal lines show points of text resetting; horizontal double lines show points of page number resetting. Blank cells signify missing leaves. type-matter that did not vary much from forme to forme; most of it was spacers. So, the skeletons tended to get re-used, with changes to the visible type as needed, in successive formes as an edition went through the press. When a forme was finished printing, the units of the skeleton were normally separated from the type- pages and used in another forme, while the stripped pages went back to the type cases for distribution. 17 After the edition was finished, the type of the skeletons would go down the same path. It was entirely possible to do multiple printings of a short book using the same setting of type. In such a scenario, the type-pages, after their first printing, would be tied up with string, with or without their skeletons, for an arbitrary period, then reimposed and reprinted. This cycle could repeat itself as many times as needed. Printers commonly stripped the headlines and direction lines when pages were finished printing, but if the skeletons happened to remain with their pages, a reprint could easily escape detection even by a modern bibliographer. Numerous examples of reprinting from standing type, at least for stretches of a few pages, are documented from the early seventeenth century and before, 18 and the prac- tice became rather common by the late eighteenth century. The reasons it was not more widespread in the 1630 s were both practical and regulatory. Between 1587 and 1637 , an order of the Stationers' Company set a limit of 1500 copies on print runs from a single setting. 19 If more copies were wanted, a scrupulous printer would have distributed the type and reset a new edition from scratch. This rule was intended to provide sufficient work for journeyman compositors, but it also made economic sense. Because hand-cast type was expensive, a printer would keep only limited amounts and would not want large chunks of it tied up and unusable for other jobs. Nevertheless, printers interpreted the regulation flexibly, and when faced with a sudden high demand for a particular title they were understandably tempted to exceed the limit. 20 If we encounter a book whose copies show only minor changes to the text but two entirely different settings of the running titles, we have a strong case that the edition went through two impressions. In the interval between them, the skeletons got distributed and had to be reset for the second run. This is what I believe happened repeatedly with The Triumph of Peace. I would contend 17. Curiously, Joseph Moxon does not discuss this practice ( Mechanick Exercises on the Whole Art of Printing , ed. Herbert Davis and Harry Carter . 2nd ed. London : Oxford University Press, 1962 ); but the books themselves give frequent evidence of it. 18. A search in ESTC for note-word "reimposed" will turn up some of these (e.g., S92876 ( 1583 ) and S125309 ( 1572 ?). See also Greg, English Printed Drama , entries 28(b) ( 1559 ), 75(b) (l578), 202(b) (l604), 203(b) ( 1604 ), 204(b,c) ( 1604–05 ), 217(b) (l605), 230(b) (l606), 295(b) ( 1611 ), 296(d) ( 1635 ), 412(b) ( 1625 ), and L18(AII) ( 1641 ?). Another probable example is Greg 466, explored by J. Caitlin Finlayson &gt; in " Thomas Heywood's Londini Artium &amp; Scientiarum Sca- turigo ( 1632 ): The Huntington and Worcester Copies—Two Issues or Variant States?"

Greg, op. cit. , pp. 94–95. that nearly every instance of arbitrary page-number substitution resulted from an interruption of work during which the whole forme was removed from the press. The type-pages were set aside for a time and then received at least reset page numbers, and usually new direction lines as well, in preparation for re- impression. Some pages underwent a complete resetting during the interval, of course including the skeleton. This is the explanation of the horizontal fractures in table 3. It is even possible that some pages were stored with their skeletons intact and went undetectably into later impressions. This could have occurred with formes D(o) and A(i) at certain points in the printing history; it is tempting to posit "silent" reimpositions that would bridge the discontinuous fault-lines in table 3. We will explore this possibility when we go into the life-histories of the individual quires. §3. Italic Raids Figure 3 shows a sort of mutation frequently found in ToP: the entire song (composed in italic type) has been reset, but not the passages in roman above. Note that short stretches of italic embedded in roman text remain unchanged. Eleven pages in ToP show this localized resetting of italic at some point in the printing history, and one of them (D2r) has part of the italic reset yet again. Two pages (including one that previously had the italic changed) also show an arbi- trary change-out of some of the roman type. Table 4 shows where these resettings occur. (Solid arrows indicate replace- ment of italic type, dashed arrows the replacement of roman.) All of them, except for the roman replacement on C1r, occur at points in the production cycle where the numbers in the headlines were also reset—in other words, during the pauses between impressions that we have already identified. Table 5 presents the history in another way. (It contains codes for production phases and variant states which I will discuss later.) This table shows all the pages of ToP that contain concentra- tions of italic. A great deal of that type is used for the songs that cluster toward the end of the masque. The local resettings do not always draw on the same font. In the earliest states of ToP , all the text—both roman and italic—is set in "english" size (20 lines = 96 mm). In the first wave of changes, the italic Song 5 on C4V reappears in pica size (82 mm). During the same transition, four lines of italic stage direction on A2v-3r switch to a 120 mm great primer. Pages C3v and D3r are a more subtle case: the reset songs are still in 96 mm italic, but the font is of a different design, which I will call i-2 as opposed to the more prevalent i-1. The differences are hard to describe, but we can compare the two in figure 3. The page on the left features Norton's regular english italic i-1, while that on the right shows the song reset in i-2—a less attractive face, smaller on the body and also (in its ToP out- ing) badly worn. The most diagnostic feature of i-2 is the h , whose legs nearly close at the bottom, so that the letter resembles a b. In its i-1 cutting, the right leg only begins to close. None of these partial resettings result in substantive textual changes. Like the page-number resettings, they bear the marks not of perfectionism but rather of FIGURE 3. Block of italic text reset: page D3r in Huntington RB 69428 (left) and Huntington RB 69432. accidental contingencies of unrelated operations. Their timing, arbitrary nature, and recourse to alternative, wrongly-sized, and sometimes inferior fonts strongly suggest that they were a response to a shortage of type, that Norton was juggling other jobs, and that ToP had to stand aside—even sacrifice some of its stand- ing type—to let those jobs "play through". I therefore refer to these incidents of localized distribution as "raids", which created holes in the composition that Norton refilled once the more pressing need was past. In §9, I will show that some of the italic distributed in the first raid ended up in ToP itself, in the two pages of dedication (leaf a2). As part of the preliminaries, these pages would have been printed after the main text if Norton was following the usual practice. Once the dedication was set, on the other hand, it remained substantially unchanged through the remainder of ToP s printing history. Norton was able to muster enough italic to restore the raided pages, though he some- times patched the holes with a mis-matched font. The first wave of raids liberated about 2130 ens of italic, but the preliminary quire of ToP contains only 42% of that, about 900 ens. Distributing more than twice the amount of needed type might have been a prudent action to ensure an adequate supply of all the sorts. If there was another job or jobs that prompted the italic raids, I have not been able to identify them. The candidates would obviously contain large amounts of Norton's english italic (96 mm). This was a slightly unusual size for standard text; the smaller pica served as the workhorse. In his books dated 1633–34 , Norton used english-sized italic mostly for matter subsidiary to the main texts—prelim- inaries and indexes. The most extended stretch of it comes in the twelve-page index of Richard Verstegan's Restitution of Decayed Intelligence (STC 21363), dated 1634 . It contains double columns of short lines of italic with a heavy admixture of roman. Its requirements hardly seem enough to stretch the resources of a print- ing house responsible for nearly thirty known jobs, or parts thereof, during the two-year span with ToP at its center. It may be safest to hypothesize that Norton was doing some job work now vanished, maybe longer than a single sheet, greedy for a larger size of italic than usual, and urgent. The fact that the raids took place at more than one point in the ToP production suggests either several ephemeral jobs, or one larger project which for some reason has not survived. In this section I have focused on localized resettings of italic passages in re- sponse to a need for type, but we need to bear in mind that any distribution of type served to make it available for other jobs. We will see instances throughout the printing history of ToP in which entire pages or formes were reset, with no discernible pattern in which pages were chosen. At the end of each printing phase, Norton had three choices of what to do with each type-page: (a) distribute it, (b) keep the text standing and strip the skeleton, or (c) keep the text stand- ing with the skeleton intact. It is quite possible that many of the resettings were motivated by a need for more roman type, and that the selection of pages was driven by which type-pages were accessible when the need arose. It is now time to look at the variants in The Triumph of Peace in detail . The following sections, §4–8, are the densest portion of this article and some readers may find in them too much of a good thing. Once we have dealt with the book at the level of quire, forme, and individual page, we will pull back to see how all TABLE 4 .

In §9–10, I will demonstrate how recurring types give evidence of the order of printing the formes; in §11–14, I will show how copies were assembled from the stock of printed sheets on hand. Section 15 presents the entire workflow as a series of specific actions, and §16 addresses basic issues like edition size and the time required to print all the copies. The metamorphosis of the printed pages entails a textual evolution in which deliberate revisions (mostly to the stage directions) appear amid a chatter of accidentals generated by the resettings. I have reserved a detailed account of these for the textual introduction to ToP in the upcoming Oxford University Press edition of Shirley's works. My method of organizing the variants is, I hope, as simple as the situa- tion allows, but it still needs a bit of explanation. The comprehensive catalogue of manifestations of all the pages, from complete resettings down to stop- press variants and even the occasional random shift, will be found as appendix 1. It is modeled on a biologist's taxonomic key, and as with all such keys the identi- fication marks are the minimum required to distinguish the states; seldom are all the variants on a page mentioned. During the first stages of organizing this list, I saw the need for some kind of shorthand to refer to each state of a page. Ideally the structure of this shorthand should express the hierarchical relation- ships of the states of each page, with the main settings at the top level followed by impositions at the next and stop-press variants at the bottom. However, as the families of variants continued to ramify—sometimes manifesting states that would not fit neatly into any hierarchy—practice sometimes overruled theory, and the codes ceased to reflect any rigid correspondence with production phases or the relative importance of the changes they denote. Attempting at this point to revise the codes to make them more consistent—to the extent that that would even be possible—would render precarious their connection with notes taken over two decades, which embody the current system in a well-documented pro- cess of evolution. For specification of the exact relationships between the states, the reader should refer to appendix 1. DEVELOPMENT BY QUIRES §4. Quire "a" A. a1R (TITLE PAGE) The four main states of the title page are shown in figure 1. A quick compari- son reveals that these states are largely in the same setting. Note, for instance, the damaged "M" in "Majesties", line 9, and the wrong-font final "3" in the imprint date, which is common to all states. It is relatively easy to demonstrate, with a purely typographic proof, that the order of states shown in figure 1 is also the order of printing. As mentioned in §1, the "O" in line 3 is sound (as illustrated) in some copies of state 1, but shows damage in others. Therefore, state 1 must be the earliest. State 3 (a unique survival at the Folger), with its dangling comma after "Grayes-Inne", must precede state 4. One would assume that the "third impression" copies came last, and this is borne out by the association of this state with later states of quires A-D, as we shall see. If we play devil's advocate and posit an order of 1,3,4,2—moving the "third impression" forwards—we would not be able to explain why line 11 of the title ("February the third, 1633 .") starts in one setting in state 1, changes to another for states 3 and 4, then reverts to the original one in state 2. (The presence of a comma or a period after "third" is the most obvious marker.) So, we can safely accept the order as illustrated. State 1 is further complicated by a deliberate realignment (state 1a2, not illustrated). Figure 1(A) shows the first word of the title sitting too far left with respect to the following line. During the printing of state 1, but after the damage to the "O" in line 3, the alignment was altered by shifting "THE" rightwards so that the "T" lay closer to the "V" below than to the "I". As a result, the word came to sit too far right on the page considered as a whole, but with respect to the following line, it is an improvement. No version of the title ever gets each line quite centered. Table 6 shows the hierarchy of changes that we have just worked out. The numbering of the states refers to appendix 1. For the title, I have called the four states 1a (with three sub-variants), 1b, 1c1, and 1c2. The notation "1" recognizes that all are in the same basic setting and that the fourth is a stop-press variant of the third. The taxonomic key ignores other adjustments, even the resetting of line 11, that accompany the revisions signaled by the chosen markers. (A full account of the evolution of the ToP title page would provide enough material for a separate article.) TABLE 6. Evolution of the title page The reason for the deletion of "of Grayes Inne" in state 1b, and its restoration in 1c, is unclear. Shirley was admitted to honorary membership in the Inn on 17Janu- ary 1634 . This was a common enough practice for individuals who had rendered a significant service, and it should not have been controversial. Quite probably, Shirley was led to expect it as part of his compensation for writing the masque. He may have allowed the words to creep into the printer's copy in advance of the actual bestowal. When someone called attention to the error, the words were deleted, only to be re- stored (in a new setting, of course) in state 1c, which was evidently printed after the honor was official. Since there is no evidence that anyone tried to suppress them in earlier copies, the deletion could represent a minor adjustment for a minor embar- rassment. It could even have happened as a stop-press correction. This theory would have a corollary that the printing of at least state 1a was well underway or completed by the middle of January, and this would support Greg's assumption that the pub- lisher aimed to have copies ready for sale by the first performance of the masque on 3 February. 21 However, the archival evidence and other facts I will adduce in §16 argue against the book's having been on sale that early. The disappearance and reappearance of "of Grayes Inne" is the first of many mysteries surrounding ToP that I will have to leave without a complete solution. B. a2R As with a1r, there was only one setting of this page. The following table shows its states along with those of the title page. 21. "Nightmare", p. 114. TABLE 7. States of the title page and a2r At the head of a2r is a decorative band composed of pairs of acorn orna- ments. The early state has 28 pairs of acorns, the later two have 27. It is nearly impossible to find individuality in acorn ornaments, but tiny differences show that the change results from resetting, not a loss of one pair on the end. The reduction happens simultaneously with a clear resetting of the direction line— signature mark "a2" and the catchword—without a change of reading. There being no reason to reset the acorns and direction line in mid-run, it appears that the printing of a2r underwent a pause at this point during which the skeleton (including the acorns in this case) was replaced. Another arbitrary change oc- curred later, when the equal leading above and below line 5 of the heading (the single word "THE") was disturbed and that line drew closer to the one below. The same operation apparently dislodged a space two lines above, following the words "Equall and", so that copies printed thereafter show a gradual rightward drift of those two words. C.a2v Like the others in quire "a", this page has only one major setting (see table 8). The first change to a2v is the stop-press correction of "ond" to "and". (The error was a simple one for either the typesetter or the previous distributor to make—the "o" box in the typecase lay just above the "a".) All copies of the un- corrected state also have the undamaged "O" on the title page (a1r:1a1a). After the correction to "and", further copies were printed before the "O" on the title became damaged (initiating state a1r:1a1b). The addition of the comma after "Honourers" on a2v occurs at the same point as the re-alignment of the first line of the title page (producing a1r:1a2). The copies with the "Third impression" title page (starting at a1r:1c) also show a resetting of the closing two lines of the dedication on a2v, with no difference in reading. This sort of arbitrary change should remind us of the headline resettings that, as I have argued, signal pauses TABLE 8. States of the title page, a2r, and a2v TABLE 9. States of quire "a" in the printing. The loss of the rule below the dedication's signature is another such indicator; it coincides with the disappearance of "of Grayes Inne" on the title (a1r:1b). Shirley's signature to the dedication and the rule below it seem to operate as part of a quasi-skeleton that is less stable than the text on which it borders. D. QUIRE "a" ENCOMPASSED Let us now combine in one sweep of the eye the states of the three type-pages comprising quire "a". Table 9 is a "plain English" version; table 10 shows the variants using the shorthand keyed to appendix 1. In both tables I have provi- sionally placed double lines at the points of possible reimposition that I have discussed above, which seem to indicate breaks in the printing. TABLE 10. States of quire "a" Note that the changes on all three pages tend to occur in lockstep. Quire "a" is a half-sheet, which would most economically be produced by half-sheet imposition run off by work-and-turn. 22 In this method, all the pages of the quire are printed at once, and the sheets are flipped end-to-end and perfected with the same pages on the back. When cut in half, each sheet yields two copies of the quire. If this were the case with ToP , and if one examined the type impression in many copies, about half will show that a2 recto was printed before the verso, while the other half will show the opposite sequence. I have attempted this exami- nation on 23 copies of ToP —a difficult process because the outer leaves normally show most of the soiling and were usually washed and pressed at some point. Only leaf a2 can be analyzed in this way because the title leaf verso is blank. But the test did show a mixture of sequences of printing, so we can be confident that quire "a" was printed by work-and-turn. Because Norton used half-sheet imposition, all three type-pages of quire "a" were accessible to alteration at the same time. So, it is not remarkable to see changes taking place across all three pages simultaneously. The thing to note at these transitional points is the mixture of arbitrary revisions with apparently rational ones. When the number of acorn pairs drops from 28 to 27, the title page gets a small realignment and the comma is added on a2v. Later, when "of Grayes-Inne" is removed from the title (state a1r:1b), the rule disappears from under the dedication on a2v and the line spacing changes on a2r; the latter is an apparently random disturbance that entails the accidental loosening of a line. The addition of "The third impression" to the title (state 1c) brings with it some 22. See Philip Gaskell , A New Introduction to Bibliography. 1972 . Reprinted with corrections. London : Oxford University Press, 1974 , p. 83 and fig. 49. needless resetting on a2v. These bursts of purposeless activity strengthen our ear- lier suspicion that the printing of the preliminaries proceeded in several discrete spurts of work, of which the double-rule boundaries I drew in the tables above mark only the most obvious transitions. I believe we have good evidence of four printings, and that the double-rule segments in tables 9–10, indicating pauses in the work, should run straight across both formes. I will refer to these printings, or discrete periods of work on the formes, as "phases", and table 11 incorporates them into a comprehensive scheme for quire "a": TABLE 11. Production phases of quire "a" and their variants My accounts of quires A-D will be less detailed than the foregoing and will ask the reader to refer to the taxonomic key of appendix 1. §5. Quire A Table 12 results from mentally removing quire A from every copy of ToP and arranging its pages in order from early to late states. Heavy horizontal cell borders indicate complete resettings; double-rule borders show reset headlines indicating reimpositions of standing type. Again the printing seems to divide into several phases. The table shows that the formes evolve in the same direction, which indicates that the printer was executing an orderly flip of the stack after printing the first forme: the first-printed sheets of one forme became the first- printed of the other. This pattern generally holds throughout ToP , though we will find some aberrations in the other quires. The table reveals that, as with the preliminary quire, Norton turned out sheet A in several discrete phases of work. The most common marker of a shift to a new phase is the resetting of the skeleton, or extensive text, of multiple pages at the same points in the production history, though quire A does not show this consistently. As mentioned in the previous section, it is often impossible to say what motivated Norton to distribute some pages and not others. In the case of quire A, all but one of the pages (A1v) retain at least half of their original settings throughout the printing history. A1v was reset after Phase I, and the bottom half of A2r was reset twice. Work on Phase II of quire A—the most clear-cut transi- tion point in the quire's evolution—began by reimposing all of the outer-forme type-pages set for the first phase. (Analysis of the type bite shows that quires A–D﻿ TABLE 12. Production phases of quire A and their variants of ToP always went through the press outer-forme first.) For the perfecting run, Norton reimposed the inner forme using two pages with minor changes from Phase I (A3v and A4r, which lay head-to-head), but the other two pages of the forme were either completely or partly reset (A1v and A2r respectively). Other phase shifts were more subtle, and the transition from IIb to III was barely a whisper: only two pages got stripped and a couple of raised quads were pushed down on a third. The backing forme shows no sign of a corresponding interruption. This lack of correlation requires some fancy explaining. My feeling is that the reimpositions on A1r and 2v, though they affect only two pages out of eight in the quire, were still associated with a work stoppage. The lowering of the quads on A4v, which happens at the same time, was probably an unintentional result of removing the type-page at the end of Phase IIb and replacing it for Phase III. Furthermore, on the evidence of the surviving copies of ToP , the number of quire-A sheets in Phases IIa and IIb combined (11) is approximately equal to the number of sheets of the other text quires in their own undivided Phase II (quire B, 10; C, 10; D, 11). Copies of the book that contain Phase III of sheets B-D also contain Phase III of sheet A. (One exceptional copy from Phase III (Folger STC 22459.2) has an A-sheet from IIb, which indicates a possible slight overrun of the A sheets that found their way into the following phase. I discuss the overrun in more detail in §13.) These are the reasons I have designated the two sub-phases within the second impression of quire A. It is likely that Norton's original intent was to print Phase II as a continuous job, but that something interrupted the machining of the outer forme and the type was removed from the press. This marked the end of Phase IIa. When he was able to resume work, he had two options. The simpler was to put the outer forme back on the press, complete the intended second impression of that, then perfect the sheets from Phases IIa-b of the outer forme together. However, a skeleton resetting on A1v and a page-number shift on A3v in the inner forme suggests that the perfecting of IIa-b also proceeded in two phases of work. Norton perfected all the IIa sheets before doing another printing of both formes to complete Phase II. Although it required more shifting of formes, this tactic would prioritize the completion of some number of finished A-sheets. This would allow a more speedy assembly of at least some copies of the whole book. The inner forme of Phase IIb is indistinguishable from that of Phase III except for a stop-press correction which appears part-way through the latter phase (A1v:2b2). On the evidence of table 12, Norton could even have printed the inner forme of Phase IIb and continued straight on to print the inner forme of Phase III in the same run, perfecting the sheets of the latter phase with the outer forme. But the type-impressions show that Norton always printed his outer formes first. So, we have to conclude that Norton began Phase III of quire A with only minor changes to the outer forme (new skeletons for A1r and A2v) and none at all to the inner. The boundary line between Phases IIb and III continues invisibly right across the inner forme. We will later see similar arbitrary patterns in the production of the other sheets. A few other observations on quire A are worth making: In the outer forme, the four pairs of variants A1r:2c1–2, A2v:2a1–2, A3r:2b1–2, and A4v:2b1–2 all involve printing accidents. The last two pairs result from specific, one-time events. On A3r, the "3" in the signature mark drops out in the second state. (This may have occurred during the act of repairing some type damage and mis-alignment at the upper left, shown uniquely in copy bL 644.0.44. 23 ) A4v:2b1 has the quads printing between the two paragraphs, as mentioned above; these rose during the reimposition preceding Phase IIb and disappeared again at the inception of Phase III. (The rule below the text shows various bends during these changes.) In contrast, the "variant" on A2v involves a progressive downward creep of the last letter of the catchword, so these are not two distinct states. Similarly, the A1r variants involve a page number that prints more or less faintly—evidently a function of variable depths of impression—and there is no clear progression one way or the other over the course of printing. All these changes present a random picture in appendix 2, but if one plucks out only Phases II and III of quire A and puts the rows in order by state, the progression becomes clear. In A1v:2b1, the jockey in the torchlight parade holds a "bride" in his hand; state 2b2 corrects this to "bridle". Previous attempts at ordering ToP (most recently in the STC) have tried to use this difference to characterize major groupings of whole copies, but we see here that it is simply a stop-press variant within Phase III. Copies of the book with sheets from Phase IV of quire A come only with a "third impression" title page, and vice versa. In this final phase, a paragraph of description added to A2r affects the page breaks for the rest of the quire. Sometimes 23. To complicate the situation further, that leaf was removed from the British Library copy by Thomas Wise and used to make up the Wrenn copy, now at the University of Texas. the transferred text was moved in type, sometimes it was reset. The method used depended largely on whether the lines travelled to a facing page (i.e. in the same forme) or to the verso (printed in the next forme, in which case the transferred text was usually reset). Section 15A gives the specifics of this process. Between Phases I and IIa, the four lines of italic split between A2v-3r were raided and reset in great primer size (120 mm). In Phase IIb, the catchword on A2v, which heretofore correctly read "The" , changes incorrectly to "All". This marries with the first word in roman type on the next page, but ignores the two lines of italic that precede it. We would expect this sort of error to arise during the italic raid after Phase I, but that had already occurred. Instead, it appears that the workman doing the reimposition for Phase IIb did not notice the italic lines and took his cue from the first paragraph in roman. The error persists through Phase III. §6. Quire B A. PHASE I The early phase of quire B presents one significant difficulty: TABLE 13. Variants in quire B, Phase I Only three pages show variant states in this phase. Those on B1r are: 1a1 heading wholly in italic 1a2 heading reset with characters' names in roman type relatively undamaged first letters of ll. 7 up and 9 up are damaged We can be reasonably certain that this is the correct order because the type damage does not occur during state 1a1, and the reset heading follows the normal convention by giving proper names in a contrasting type style. The variants in B3v-4r, in the backing forme, involve commas. 24 Neither state is obviously the earlier, but the direction of the change is less interesting at this point than its confused relationship with the outer forme: the early and late 24. What I have called state 1a1 of B3v has "off throw" in l. 10; B4r ll. 16–17 read "This [man] with a face Philosophicall and beard / Hath with the study of twenty yeares found out / A lampe ...". State 1a2 of both pages respectively have "off, throw" and "This with a face Philosophicall and beard, / Hath with the study of twenty yeares, found out / A lampe ..." states of the outer forme each occur with both states of the inner forme. The distribution of surviving copies is as shown below: TABLE 14. Distribution of selected variants of quire B in Phase I If, after printing the outer forme, the printer followed a normal turn of the heap of sheets that contained B1r, we would expect the changes on B3v-4r, in the backing forme, also to follow an orderly progression from early to late. We saw this pattern in quire A. In contrast, the distribution of states in Phase I of quire B shows a sort of "countercurrent eddy", indicated by the shaded cells above. It appears that a disorderly stack-turn took place. To understand this concept, first recall that a normal print run of a forme might produce several hundred sheets, yielding a thick pile of damp paper with the last-printed sheets on top. To preserve the same order and orientation of sheets going through the press on the perfecting run, the pile had to be inverted end-to-end. Since the pile was too bulky to turn as a unit, the workman had to transfer it in several handfuls, inverting each one onto the new stack. Suppose instead that the workman carelessly transferred one handful of sheets straight across without turning it. This would produce a stratum of sheets with the printing facing the wrong way. We would expect the pressman, when working down the pile and finding this mistake, to utter a curse, turn the affected sheets to align with the others, and go on working. But he might also utter a curse and start picking up the sheets from the opposite end, using a slightly different motion to place them on the tympan. The pinholes—normally positioned slightly asymmetrically—would help prevent mishaps in perfecting, and the pressman might enjoy the little bit of variety until reaching the underlying layer of correctly oriented sheets. This seems to be what happened in Phase I of quire B. Let us use our sample of the nineteen copies of that phase to stand for the entire first printing of this gathering. The machining of the outer forme (containing B1r) produced a heap like the one on the left below, with the later states on top. If we now back up these partially garbled sheets with the inner forme containing B3v-4r, which begins with state 1a1 and switches to state 1a2 about half-way through, we get the observed distribution of variants (table 15). A stack turn with handful B transferred without flipping is the only scenario that yields the observed results if we assume the printer started the perfecting run at the top of the stack and worked his way straight through. Our thought experiment also shows that state iai of B3v-4r most likely came first. If state 1a2 had been earlier, we would have to hypothesize a second turning of the garbled stack—this time correctly done—yielding the inverse of the first column above. The reader may verify that this does not yield the observed distribution of states. We cannot change the boundaries of group B without creating a conflict with the observed combinations, so that cohort must represent the survivors of a manageable number of sheets that the worker was comfortable picking up with two hands. It is tempting to extrapolate from our nineteen-copy sample to estimate the total number that were printed in Phase I. If group B represents one "grab", the total first printing of the quire might have contained four roughly equal handfuls of damp sheets, each of which in ToP measured about 41 by 31 cm. 25 A practical trial might provide an estimation of the edition size. However, it proves difficult to locate a source of poor-quality, lightweight, handmade paper with 25. Based on the Huntington Library's uncut copy (RB 69433) TABLE 15. Distribution of copies resulting from anomalous transfer of handful B similar characteristics to that used in ToP; and I have been no more successful in getting usable data from present-day fine printers regarding their paper-turning habits. It turns out that there are a host of variables that make it impossible even to approximate an upper limit on the edition size by this means. It should make us slightly uncomfortable that B1r state 1a2b is absolutely coextensive with group A. The last handful (or more likely two) appears to have contained only that state, which occurs nowhere else; and state 1a2a is found only in handful B. If my analysis above is correct, and if further copies of ToP were to come to light, one of them might contain B1r:1a2a combined with a later state of B3v-4r. B. QUIRE B, PHASES II-IV, OUTER FORME The next phases of quire B are so complex that it is necessary to analyze the two formes separately. After Phase I, three of the pages of B(o) were reset and one (B3r) was reprinted with a new skeleton. Phase II's only variants occur on B4v (in states 2a1 –3) in the passage "ayre, ... with an artificiall bellowes coold". The last word also appears TABLE 16. Variants in quire B outer forme, Phases II-IV as "cool" and "coo". Neither reading makes as much sense as "coold" (2a1), and the variants probably result from a two-stage accidental loss of letters from the end of the line. Frisket slip is not a suspect here because there are no intermediate states—the letters are either completely present or completely lacking. For Phase IIIa, all of the pages have new skeletons. Page B4v state 2b2, found uniquely in a copy at St. Catharine's College, Cambridge (Z.59), presents a problem because the page number has shifted horizontally. However, the type appears to be the same and the page is unchanged in other respects, so reimposition is not likely to be the cause. If looseness in the line caused the shift, we would also expect slightly different spacing among the three characters of the page number, but we do not see this either. It remains an unexplained problem, but a minor one. In the discussion of quire A, I identified a point within Phase I at which press- work was interrupted, but the other formes of the book from that phase did not show a similar hiatus. Sub-Phases IIa and IIb were in effect separate printings of quire A, with both formes showing changes. Quire B is a slightly different case. Again, it appears that a more urgent job interrupted the printing, this time during Phase III of the outer forme. The delay was long enough that the type-pages were stripped and probably tied up. After the other job played through, printing of B(o) resumed with a new skeleton, including a new arrangement of acorns on B1r. (I have not been able to determine whether the direction lines were reset as well—they are closely similar.) These re-imposed copies constitute Phase IIIb. However, both of these impositions of the outer forme occur with identical states of the inner forme. The two sub-phases of the outer forme seem to have gone through a single perfecting run. 26 Apart from this one forme—and a couple of other small variants which I will discuss in §11–14—these five copies resemble the twelve others from Phase III. 26. The five witnesses to quire B's Phase IIIb are at the Newberry, Bristol Central Library, the Elizabeth Club (Yale), the Bodleian (Mal. 160(3)), and Dartmouth College. The following corrections demonstrate that Phase IIIb indeed followed Phase IIIa: TABLE 17. Variants in quire B, Phases IIIa,b In Phase IV of this forme, a few things are of interest: On B1r, the page number wanders a bit horizontally over the 15th pair of acorns. Likewise, on B2v, the stem of page number "4" can point to the first letter of "the" below, to the "o" in the preceding word, or anywhere in-between. In this phase, B3r picks up the first three lines of text (in a new setting) from the following page, relieving some crowding on the latter. On B4V, the four flush-right italic lines have been raided and are reset in smaller (pica) size. The two centered italic lines on the same page are unaffected, perhaps because it was not worth the trouble to get at them. On this page also the page number is horizontally unstable. This example of wandering, along with items 1 and 2 above, are among many in ToP that demonstrate that lockups on the press bed must have been much less rigid than Joseph Moxon's descriptions would lead us to expect. C. QUIRE B, PHASES II-III, INNER FORME TABLE 18. Variants in forme B(i), Phases II-III The inner forme of quire B is even more perplexing than the outer one. Phase II begins with a complete resetting of all four pages. Shortly afterward, B4r alone acquires a reset skeleton (state 2b), which persists into Phase III. The direction of the change from 2a to 2b is confirmed by a textual correction and progressive damage to line 7 during state 2b. For only one page of a forme to change its skeleton is puzzling enough. But it also occurs against a background of changes to its forme-mates B1v-2r which do not develop in consistent directions. These variants are: B1v: The "V" beginning line 10 is more or less displaced downward, or is entirely absent. Where it is absent, the "D" from two lines down drifts up into the vacant space. B2r: 1. St. Catharine's College ( Cambridge ) Z.55 shows a unique setting of the page number. The number "3" comes from a different font than that found elsewhere in the book, being rounded and with the upper loop noticeably smaller than the lower. It is evenly spaced between undamaged parentheses. All the other copies have the usual narrow "3" with loops about the same size, and one or both of the page-number parentheses are either damaged or fouled with ink. This number was apparently not locked up tight, and it can fall anywhere from close to the left parenthesis to centered between the two. The direction line appears to contain the same type as does the St. Catharine's copy. In some exemplars, the right ends of lines 1 and/or 4 creep upwards by varying degrees. The comma ending line 6 prints either normally or as a blob. A stray bit of metal resembling a hyphen may show in the empty space between lines 6 and 7 and below the "na" of "nature" in line 4. A tabulation of these features shows some correlation among certain manifestations of variant 1 above (a bit of dirt on the right parenthesis at about 2 o'clock), variant 2 (both lines displaced), and the blobby comma in variant 3. But other characteristics do not line up, either with each other or with the amount of type damage on B4r. Most of the features are of a transient nature and could be reversible: for instance, the wayward "V" on B1v could drift, fall out, and be replaced, so late copies might look like early ones. The loose page number with its parentheses could have fallen apart near the end of the run, and all three types could have been reset to produce the unique manifestation in the St. Catharine's copy. The stray metal in variant 5 could have been slightly raised in the forme throughout this phase, but would print only when sufficient pressure Excessive attention to these details might not be either productive or healthy, but it is not so easy to dismiss the skeleton change on B4r early in Phase II (the transition from state 2a to 2b), mentioned above. Because there is no evidence of changes on the other three pages of the forme at that point, it presents a challenge to my theory that arbitrary page-number changes are signs of work stop- pages. It is another occurrence I will have to leave unexplained. D. QUIRE B, PHASE IV, INNER FORME; QUIRE B RECAPITULATION The final phase (IV) of forme B(i) shows a resetting of all the pages. For no obvious reason, the four-line roman-face stage direction on B3v beginning "The Gentleman ..." is now set in pica, one step smaller than the surrounding text. TABLE 19. Forme B(i), Phase IV Combining all that we have discussed about both formes of quire B generates table 20, which is puzzling in its fragmentation and necessarily evasive about correlations among certain states below a certain level of detail. TABLE 20. Synopsis of variants in quire B Nevertheless, it is possible to discern two events, initiating Phases II and IV, that clearly interrupted work on the entire quire. These resulted in the resetting or reimposition of almost all the pages. The outer forme underwent two more skeleton changes on its own, introducing Phases IIIa and IIIb. §7. Quire C Table 21 shows four relatively clear-cut phases of production for all of quire C. Phases II and III are signalled by reimpositions or resettings that run straight across both formes. Phase IV is more subtle, having only two pages reimposed. But the remaining pages (except for C3r, which comes over completely unchanged from Phase III) all show revisions, some of them major, at the inception TABLE 21. Variants in quire C of Phase IV, and the timing of these coincides with the major discontinuities that we have already shown initiating the final printing phase of the preceding quires. (Appendix 3 shows this correlation most clearly.) Phase IV of this quire is found only with the "third impression" title pages and vice versa. So, despite the lack of extensive resetting at this point, we can still assert the likelihood that the alterations to both formes preceding this final phase took place during a significant pause in the press run. On C2v, the action of the masque enters its final phase, which features numerous songs set in italic. These provide the main source for the italic raids discussed in §3. The production of the quire went as follows: A. PHASE I C outer forme shows a normal pattern of variants whose sequence is all but certain. The inner forme, however, presents an insoluble problem in the sorting of the two variants of C1v, which at line 23 has either (1a1) "We change the Seene" or (1a2) "We change the Scene". These are found in the combinations shown in table 22. (The remaining three pages of C(i) are invariant, so are not shown.) About half the sheets (the eight copies shown in the last row of the table) have the latest states of both the outer and inner formes, as we would expect, but the other ten sort illogically. Unlike the retrograde pattern of quire B Phase I (§6A), the existence of all these permutations cannot be explained by any plausible irregularity in turning the stack. Only dropping some portion of the sheets on the floor and picking them up more or less at random would cause the first state of the inner forme to be printed on the back of three of the four variants of the outer forme. "Accidents at the press" is the last resort of the baffled bibliographer, and I will not waste space here in trying to develop such an explanation. TABLE 22. Distribution of C1v variants in Phase I On C4V the bottom lines of text are bent upwards at the right. The greatest amount of deflection is a bit more than 2 mm—so, rather less than half the height of one line—but bad register with the text on the back of the leaf makes it quite noticeable. This much distortion would be impossible if the non-printing space on the page were packed solid; there must have been a gap in the lockup, and I would guess that one of the lines of Song 5 somehow got into the forme without being justified. Such an oversight would also explain the slight misalignment in lines 7–9 on the same page. This precarious situation might have made it impossible for a workman to pick up and transport the locked-up forme in the manner described by Moxon, 27 but the interaction of pressures along both dimensions of the page was apparently sufficient to keep types from being pulled during presswork. This is the most graphic demonstration in ToP that printing could proceed with adequate stability even if regions of the forme lacked support on all four sides. We have already seen instances in §6B of wandering alignment between adjacent lines that probably arose from similar causes. 27a B. PHASE II Phase II shows raiding of italic on pages C2v, C3r, and C4v. These pages contained all of the main caches of italic in the outer forme. C4v was particularly heavy-hit, being totally reset except for the roman lines 7–9 and the last line. After the raid, the italic Song 5 and its roman title on that page reappeared in pica size. The inner forme of quire C offered an even richer source of italic than the outer, but it was never raided at this point, or ever during the history of ToP. The reason is probably that C(i) was on the press and inaccessible while C(o) was being raided. C1v does show resetting of the italic in lines 8–10 and 25–27, but this page was not a plentiful source for the font, and the resettings could have arisen from some other cause. (For instance, the earlier state showed a comma 27. Pp. 232–233, 238–239, 310. 27a. Peter Blayney's recent work on quotation quadrats ("Quadrat Demonstrandum," PBSA , 111.1 (March 2017, pp. 61–101) gives a probable mechanism for some of these displacements. out of place in line 7, and it is possible that lines 8–10 were pied in the act of repositioning it.) C1r in this phase shows some horizontal instability in the page-number position. C. PHASE III In this phase, pp. C2r and C3v—which lie side by side in the forme—undergo the only complete resettings in the history of quire C. Head to head with these, but later in the phase, C1v and C4r both show page-number shifts. These are probably simultaneous but random drifts, as the types in the page numbers appear to be the same before and after. However, the five copies which show this deviation happen to be the same ones which contain quire B from Phase IIIb. I will discuss this uncomfortable coincidence in §13. Also in this phase, the text of C1v shows further instability around the same points which changed in Phase II: the italic in lines 1 –10 and the last four lines is reset, the fourth line up ("A Landschape the Scene.") going missing in the first of two steps to a smooth transition between antimasques. When lines 8–10 were changed in the previous phase, the period after "carryed off" in line 9 ended up below the line (which shows another unstable lockup). In Phase III, it is properly aligned, and the resetting of the nearby italic may have had some connection with that repair-work. D. PHASE IV Phase IV, as mentioned above, is found only in "third impression" copies of ToP , and, like the final phase of quire A, it introduces important textual revisions that alter the page breaks within the quire. Edits on C1v and 2r shorten the word count significantly, causing two-line chunks of the text to move backwards until the original breaks resume at the end of C2v. This phase gives us further examples of text that is reset either larger or smaller than the prevailing 96 mm "english" size: C1r: At the top of the page, a brace separates the list of three characters from their stage directions on the right. In the original setting, the directions crowd right up to the brace. In Phase IV, the direction is reset in 82 mm pica; the line breaks are the same, but the page gains some needed white space. C2r: The antimasque of the "phantastique Adventurer" has the same layout as the previous example, with a brace separating the names of the characters from their stage directions. In this last phase, the directions are rewritten and lengthened, so the compositor reset them in pica type apparently to maintain visual balance. §8. Quire D and "A Speech" Readers who have followed me to this point will, I trust, agree that the thirty-six pages of The Triumph of Peace comprise a Wunderkammer of bibliographical problems, any one of which could support a separate study. The last quire will not disappoint. A. QUIRE D PHASES I-II Quire D begins life with an outer forme showing an orderly progression of variants: TABLE 23. Variants in forme D(o), Phases I-II The second state of D1r supplies a missing word; at the same time the first three lines lose their horizontal alignment. This state gives way to a third one in which the same three lines of type are damaged. D4v shows a more subtle change, in which the right parenthesis of the page number suffers damage near the bottom; this occurs while D1r is in its second state. The inner forme on this set of sheets also shows a regular progression, but with a clear work stoppage indicating two phases: TABLE 24. Variants in forme D(i), Phases I-II The variants are D1v: State 1a1 has a comma that has slipped into the line below, and a damaged parentheses to the right of the page number. In state 1a2, the comma is correctly positioned and the parenthesis is sound. This sequence, which could have gone in the opposite direction, is confirmed by D2r: The second state (1a2) corrects a typo, improves sense by adding a comma, and pushes down one of two quads that were printing inappropriately in the first state. The conspicuously damaged parenthesis in D1v:1a1 is the same one found on C2v, also in Phase I, in the same position to the right of the page number and in the same quarter of the forme. This recurrence gives us a clue about the order of printing these quires in Phase I. There are two possibilities: Quire D came first. The damaged parenthesis was removed part-way through Phase I as one of five stop-press improvements to the inner forme, but instead of being discarded it was put back in the type-case and later set—coincidentally in the same position—in the headline of C2v. Quire C came first. After Phase I of that quire the damaged parenthesis either persisted on D(i) as part of the skeleton, or returned to the type-case to be set—coincidentally in the same position—on D1v. In either case, part way through Phase I of quire D, its damaged state caught the eye of the corrector and it was discarded. The second possibility—that the parenthesis remained as part of the skeleton and was later replaced by a sound type—is much more likely; and indeed this damaged parenthesis never reappears in later states of ToP. The independent typographic evidence that Phase II of the inner forme followed Phase I is rather slight: the correction of one error in line 8 of D3v, which kept the same setting of the first twenty-one lines from Phase I. However, as most copies of ToP containing Phase II also contain later states of quires A-C, we can be confident of this direction of change. When we put together Phases I and II of the two formes of D, their relationship becomes complicated: TABLE 25. Variants in quire D, Phases I-II This table shows two oddities beyond the fault-lines indicating the pauses in production, which by now we have become accustomed to: There were two production phases of the inner forme, marked by skeleton changes on three pages (D1v, D2r, and D3v) and a complete resetting of D4r. However, the outer forme of the same sheets appears to be the product of one continuous printing, with states 1a2 and 1a3 each appearing within Phases I or II, not during a pause between them. Phase I of this quire shows an illogical mixing of states between the two formes. If we consider only the states in this phase and ignore the invariant pages, the scheme looks like this: TABLE 26. Distribution of states of quire D, Phase I This is very nearly a random shuffling; like the permutations of quire C in Phase I, it cannot be attributed to any plausible method of flipping a single stack. The three combinations that do not occur are early/early, middle/middle, and late/middle; but there is no guarantee that these would not emerge if new copies of the book were to come to light. As with quire C, I am unable to explain the distribution of variants here. Point 1 above—the fact that the inner forme goes through two production phases while the outer forme appears to have only one—is easier to explain if we suppose that the outer forme went through two printings with no alteration during the pause between them. Phase II of D(i) associates mostly with the third state of the outer forme (D1r:1a3), in which the first three lines of type on D1r show damage. The accident that caused this may in fact have come in the transition to Phase II. The distribution of surviving copies is as follows: TABLE 27. Correlation of D1r variants with phases of D(i) Only two copies (McMaster University, and British Library Ashley 1697 , shaded above) show sheet D with its inner forme from Phase II but the outer forme in the undamaged state typical of Phase I. 28 If we take the hypothesis that 28. These copies contain quires A-C from Phase II. the outer forme had two separate printings corresponding to Phases I and II of the inner forme, there are at least two possible explanations for the observed distribution: The damage occurred early in the second printing of D(o), or McMaster and Ashley 1697 represents a small residue of sheets which for some reason were not perfected during Phase I. The damage occurred during the replacement of the outer forme in preparation for Phase II. The Phase II sheets with the damaged type were combined with the Phase I leftovers and perfected with Phase II of the inner forme. It is more likely for damage to occur at points of transition than during periods of repetitive work, so I lean toward the second explanation. Either one requires some special pleading to fit the hybrid copies into a plausible narrative. There is no doubt, though, that they are closely associated with the skeleton change in D(i), which marks the end of Phase I of that forme, and the same phase also produced about equal numbers of quires A-C. Before Phase II came the pause during which italic was raided in quires A and C. Norton raided quire D as well, but only the inner forme. Three of its constituent pages show the italic in a new setting in Phase II, while the fourth page—consisting almost entirely of italic—was entirely reset. D3r, in the outer forme, could have supplied a good amount of the font but was not touched. For Phase II of quire D, Norton printed the outer forme, as I have argued, unchanged from its Phase I state except for the damage to D1r (which could also have happened early in Phase II). Following Phase II, another small italic raid occurred on both formes, carrying off the songs on D2r and D3r. The former leaf had already been raided, even more extensively, following Phase I. The second raid shows a continuing need for the font beyond its earlier use to set the dedication for ToP; some other job was interrupting at this point. Concurrently with these replacements, and quite bafflingly, the roman portion of D3v—about two thirds of the page—was reset. I cannot begin to suggest a reason for this. B. QUIRE D PHASES III-IV Uniquely for ToP , Phases III and IV of quire D contain two different settings that mix randomly in copies containing Phases III and IV of the other quires. I will call these settings A and B: TABLE 28. Quire D settings, Phases III-IV Setting A, in six out of the eight pages of the quire, is simply a reimposition of the standing type from Phase II; the first two pages are reset. Setting B contains typographic features not found elsewhere in ToP , nor in any of Norton's printing from the years 1633–34 that I have seen. The characteristics are: Quire D, setting B Rest of ToP (Norton) k The diagonal arms are stunted, the upper-right serif failing to reach the x-height and sometimes tilted upward. k The upper diagonal arm consistently reaches the x-height. w In some examples, the left V meets the right one a bit downward from the middle serif; the bottom of the left V falls below the baseline of the right one, so that the letter usually appears to tilt to the left. W The left and right V's meet the middle serif at the same height, and the letter does not tilt. h The curvature of the legs is midway between that of Norton's i-1 and i-2; the right leg ends pointing left. h In i-1 the legs curve slightly toward each other but do not approach closure; the right leg ends pointing 45 degrees below horizontal. In i-2, they close almost completely; the right leg ends pointing straight left. 3 Full-bodied. 3 Abnormally narrow. o Ranges with the other lowercase letters. o Usually too large. Setting B, showing stunted "k" (Houghton STC 22459a.5) Setting A (Norton), showing oversized "o" (Huntington 69432) These are strong tendencies, not invariable markers, but the differences are pronounced enough to indicate that a second printer's type was used in setting B. The immediate suspicion falls on Nicholas Okes, with whom Norton at this time had an informal and increasingly fractious partnership. 29 Okes had already 29. Alan B.

The factotum on a2r came from his 1609 stock as catalogued by Peter Blayney 30 —Norton is known to have filched other woodcut material during their association. To confirm my hunch about Okes, I surveyed English books printed in 1633–34 , searching for the odd "k" and "W" in particular. Unsurprisingly, this did not yield an unequivocal answer. Early-modern printers' typographic stocks were not proprietary, homogeneous, or static, and there are no woodcut elements in quire D to help finger the collaborator. I found versions of the stunted "k" in the repertoire of numerous printers, including at the university towns, and "W" showed great variability in most samples. Many texts I looked at did not even contain english-size type— the smaller pica is much more common—and a good proportion were Latin, in which letters "W" and "k" are rare. My search for definite fingerprints became an exercise in probabilities, trying to estimate frequencies of the characteristic sorts in scattered pools of the target font. In the end, though, my survey supported Nicholas Okes as the most likely owner of the type used in quire D setting B. 31 A hardier investigator than I might be able to clinch the identity with a survey of broken types in Okes' other productions, but for narrative simplicity in this account I will treat it as a certainty. Though Okes' type may appear in setting B, we cannot assume that he had personal responsibility for the printing. A series of undated petitions beginning in late 1635 shows a deteriorating relationship with his partner. Okes' most interesting complaint is that Norton, "wanting Capacitie himself for the Government of a presse hath enterteined ayded &amp; assisted a Company of disorderlie &amp; factious persons for the erecting of an unlawfull presse in a secrett place, and hath without [my] knowledge &amp; Consent ... secretly conveyed out of [my] house [my] formes and lettres which afterwardes were discovered and seized by the master &amp; wardens of the Company of Stacioners &amp; at their hall melted and defaced to [my] great disgrace and losse." 32 The chronology of these events is vague, but another document, dated January 1635 , reinforces the impression that both men were accustomed to playing fast and loose in their business. This list, endorsed by Sir John Lambe of the High Commission, claims that the two printers jointly employed, in addition to five authorized apprentices, six individuals "brought upp to Printing against order". 33 The latter group, which included a butcher, a gingerbread maker, and a garbler, may have constituted the "disorderly and factious" team that Norton recruited to run his clandestine press. There is no evidence that the "Okes" ToP quire D was printed off-site, or even that Norton 30. Blayney , op. cit. , p. 445, factotum 1 (rotated 180°).

Greg, Companion , p. 331. had such an operation while TOP was being printed. But the partnership clearly operated in the shadows, and we cannot take for granted the ostensible paternity of any of their productions. Okes' setting of quire D occurs in seven of the seventeen surviving copies of Phase III and in four of the nine copies of Phase IV Possibly Norton and Okes each printed about equal numbers of sheets to supply the last two phases, or Okes printed rather fewer. I have not found any variants in Okes' sheets. Although the typesetting is not error-free, one gets the impression of a more assured compositorial hand than Norton's crew could muster. It is not clear why Norton brought in a second printer at this late stage to run off a "duplicate" setting of the quire. In §16, I will show that the time gained by running the same eight pages of text on two presses was nearly offset by the time taken in setting them anew. The complications of using a clandestine off-site press would further reduce or even negate the advantage. This consideration, along with the greater professionalism of Okes' quire D setting, argues against Norton's direct agency in its production. We know that Phases III and IV of sheets A-C contain multiple impressions, so we would expect sheet D to show evidence of this as well during Okes' involvement. However, as mentioned, Okes' sheets contain no variants that I have identified. Norton's sheets for Phases III-IV are also virtually identical, but D1r shows some interesting small changes: 2a1: l. 10 has "Masqncrs"; signature mark under the "hi" of "white," 2a2: l. 10 has "Masquers"; signature mark under the comma of "white," 2a3: l. 10 has "Masquers"; signature mark under the "w" of "white," From the spelling correction it appears that states 2a2 and 2a3 follow 2a1. The shifts in the direction line raise the spectre of reimposition. However, the signature mark—anomalously, an italic "D"—appears to be the same type in all three states. (Transient bits of foreign matter appear either as specks within the letter [mostly in 2a2] or falling across one or the other serif.) The page number also appears invariant in composition and position. It would be tempting to attribute the states of the direction line to random shifts due to loose lockup, except that there are n ointermediate states, and the variants tend to sort in a complex but fairly orderly fashion with sheets of the other quires. Norton's states of sheet D show the following distribution: TABLE 29. Correlation of Norton's D1r states with B(o) and C(i) in Phases III-IV The table shows that state D1r:2a1 is found only with Phase-III copies of the other quires, while 2a3 associates (with a single exception) with Phase-IV copies. State 2a2 (shaded) is transitional between 2a1 and 2a3, and it occurs in copies having B(o) from Phase IIIb. Those same copies have unique states of pages in the inner forme of sheet C. In §11–14, I will return to these links among the three quires. For now, it appears that the D sheets containing Norton's D1r:2a3 could represent a discrete Phase IV, his final one for that quire. The "leakage" of 2a3 into Phase III, represented by the Newberry copy, could have resulted from Norton's having printed sheet D a bit short in phase III. Thus, a small group of Phase-III copies of the book may have been made up with Phase-IV sheets of quire D. Those hybrids probably went to the warehouse along with the purebred Phase-IV copies. If we accept that Norton printed Phases III and IV of quire D as distinct impressions, what about Okes? Might he have printed all his sheets for both phases in one go? If we allow this possibility, we have to explain the fact that, in the surviving copies, Okes' contribution makes up about an equal proportion in each phase: respectively 41 and 44%. When, after Phase III, a workman began collating complete copies, he would probably start picking D-sheets from a homogeneous batch of one or the other man's production, whichever came to hand first. This process would almost certainly produce different Norton/Okes ratios in Phases III and IV So, either the D sheets after Phase III already contained about 40% of Okes' work, or Norton deliberately manipulated the ratio to equal that in the upcoming Phase IV. Such an intervention supposes obscure motives and more fastidiousness than I can credit Norton with. The same objection applies to a hypothesis that both men printed their sheets for Phases III and IV in a continuous run. The more plausible explanation is that Norton brought in Okes to print a half-share of Phase III sheets, but asked him to keep the eight pages in type, skeletons intact, against a probable fourth printing. When that need came about, Okes was able quickly to reimpose the pages without alteration for the new run. This scenario asks a high degree of precision from Okes, and requires that he tie up eight pages of type without knowing for certain whether they would be needed—otherwise, why not go ahead and print Phases III and IV together? I cannot give a detailed and definitive account of Okes' work cycle. It is intertwined with the mystery of why he got involved at all; if we knew the answer to one, the other would probably follow. However, I favor the theory that Norton's and Okes' teams worked in tandem on Phase III of quire D, and that—on the slim evidence of surviving copies—each produced an approximately equal number of sheets, of which Norton's contained states D1r:2a1 and the much less common 2a2. Once they reached the end of Phase III, the pages of type from both printers' pairs of formes were tied up and there was a pause, during which completed copies from Phase III were assembled and dispatched. After an indeterminate time came Phase IV, for which both printers again machined approximately equal runs of their respective settings of quire D. Norton's sheets of these final copies differ from those of Phase III only in the position of the signature mark on D1r, which moved about three millimeters, probably during the reimposition process, producing state 2a3 of that page. TABLE 30. Phases in the printing Norton and Okes seemed to feel that a further impression would be called for after Phase III, but something prevented them from going on to print a double run of quire D. The publisher Cooke may have been uncertain about demand. But Phase IV also ushers in the bulk of the substantive textual variants in ToP These occur in the description of the procession on A2r and A3r, in the tavern direction on B3r, and in antimasques on C1v and C2r. None of the variants are stylistic; they seem rather to document actual changes in the performance. By the end of Phase III, Norton and Okes may have known that revisions were coming. Although, in the event, none of these fell in quire D, the printers may not have known this, and therefore put the type-pages for the last quire aside until the matter was settled. The singleton epilogue leaf "A speech to the King and Queenes Maiesties", found in only four copies (and Greg's own copy, now untraced), 34 exists in a single state, printed by Norton using mostly his workhorse italic i-1. The page is headed by the now-familiar motif of a double row of acorns (28 pairs in this case). I will consider the history and status of this addendum in succeeding sections. §9. Order of Printing the Quires In the preceding sections, we have been exploring ToP "vertically", as it were —working out the histories of individual pages, studying their chemistry as they combine into formes and quires, and watching each quire evolve in isolation from the others. It is now time for a "horizontal" approach as we begin to reconstruct the progress of printing the whole text, phase by phase. Table 30, a modified version of appendix 3, shows how these phases align across the quires of the surviving copies. It shows a fairly orderly stratification: for a given copy of the book, the phase of any one of quires A-C serves as a good predictor of the phases of the others. The few exceptions to this among the survivors result, I believe, from the occasional necessity of making up copies with sheets from neighboring phases. (I will discuss this further in §11–14.) But the phases do not leapfrog one another: II and IV never mix in a copy, nor III and I or IV and I. If sheets from more than one phase were available simultaneously for gathering complete copies, there was nothing to stop Norton from mixing them indiscriminately, because the text-breaks across quires never change. Except for the "third impression" copies he would have no motivation for keeping the products of one phase segregated from another. Therefore, I think we can safely hold to the theory of four discrete printings of the book as a whole. The recurrence of types can give us clues about the order of printing the quires. (Lacking evidence to the contrary, I will assume for the ensuing discussion that the order of printing in ToP is the same as the order of composition.) We would expect Norton to work through quires A-D in sequence. But here, as so often, ToP hands us a surprise. The recurring types in the first phase of printing that I could confidently identify are distributed as follows: 34. Illustrated in Greg, "Nightmare" (footnote 1). A. PHASE I TABLE 31. Recurring type material in Phase I On first glance, the table appears to show nothing out the ordinary. Quire B inner forme could have been set with type distributed from the outer forme of A; Norton could even have begun at the title page and proceeded straight through the book. But we need to take into account what happened to the individual pages at the end of Phase I. In fact, the outer forme of quire A remained in substantially the same setting through the printing history of ToP , whereas quire B was distributed after Phase I. So, types from A(o) were not available to set B(i)— rather the opposite. Therefore, A(o) was set after B(i) went through the press and got broken down. Similarly, quire "a" continued to hang onto most of its type (predominantly 96 mm italic) while D2r was raided for its italic after Phase I. (I have indicated the point of the raid with a wavy border in table 31, distinguishing the fate of that page from that of D4r, which was entirely distributed.) The preliminaries could not have been set until printing was finished on quire D inner forme. Furthermore, two letters on D2v show that that page could not have been set until after the distribution of at least part of each forme of quire B; and a distinctive bracket on C2r shows that C(i) cannot have been set before B(i) was off the press. So, quires C and D both followed B. In §8A, I showed, on the evidence of one broken parenthesis in the headline, that quire D was probably printed after quire C. No other types from C show up elsewhere; it was probably set while quire B was still being worked off, after which it held onto most of its roman type through the succeeding phases. Italic raids on C after Phase I must have supplied some other printing job than ToP. If, then, we may consider entire quires as production units, it appears that the printing of Phase I followed the sequence B-C-D-A-a. Nothing in the data shows that the preliminary quire "a" had to come last, as long as it followed D from which it drew some of its type. But preliminaries were normally printed at the end of the job, and if "a" followed D directly, there would have had to be a pause for D(i) to be at least partly distributed. (Remember that in ToP the inner formes were printed after the outer ones, and it is only D(i) that provided types for quire "a".) Something caused Norton to place quire A late in the schedule. A probable reason emerges when we recall that quires B-D contain the text of the masque, while quire A sets the stage, as it were, with a description of the costumes, scenery, and the public procession that opened the performance. Most of this is written in the past tense, as if reporting the finished event, while the stage directions for the masque itself are mostly (though not exclusively) in the conventional present tense. This division between reportage and direction again raises the question of whether copies of the book were in fact available on the day of the first performance—a matter which I will explore further in §16. The important point here is that the details of the procession were more likely to be in flux until the last minute, whereas a relatively stable text of the masque would have been needed earlier so the performers could learn their parts. Though both sections show light revision through the printing history, it would have made sense to start work on the part least likely to change. Quite possibly, Norton began typesetting the main text before Shirley had even finished writing the description of the procession. If typesetting and printing began with quire B, as the evidence above indicates, this may explain why this quire alone was mostly distributed after Phase I— seven of its eight pages broken up, as opposed to only one page each in quires A and D, and none in C. I have already mentioned the often arbitrary pattern of which pages got distributed and which survived into later impressions. However, this first quire printed could represent an initial intent to play by the rules and distribute type after running an impression—a routine that Norton could discard if he learned that he would have to achieve faster production than planned. Two other observations are worth mentioning here: Quires A, C, and D have a type-page width of 89–91 mm, but quires "a" and B measure 97 mm—three ens of english type wider. 35 These different widths imply at least two differently adjusted composing sticks, suggesting more than one compositor. 2.The last page of quire B has some overly generous leading, indicating some distress in copy-fitting. This could reflect a compensation for the unexpected use of the wider measure just mentioned. 35. From CSmH 69422, I measured the line lengths in quires A and C as 90 or 91 mm, and in quire D as 89–90; but the difference is probably not significant. B. PHASE II TABLE 32. Recurring type material in Phase II After Phase II, only four pages were distributed, plus italic portions of D2r and D3r; recurring types therefore provide less evidence for the order of printing in this phase than for Phase I. (The wavy border below D2r in this table shows that only the italic portion was reset; one of its types turns up on B4v.) Here again, it appears that quire A was printed after quire D: D1v was distributed at the end of this phase and two of its types show up on A2r. On the other hand, quire A held onto most of its type from this phase onward and could not have supplied it to D or any other quire. It also looks (on the evidence of only two types, but both are quite distinctive) as if quires D and C were finished print- ing before quire B could be set—again, because quire B carries its types largely unaltered into the next phase, while the donor pages in quires C and D give up type after Phase II. These observations show that quires C and D were printed before quires A and B. The fact that Phase II of quire A actually consisted of two separate printings complicates the picture. In §5, I suggested that, after an inter- ruption in the Phase-II printing of A(o), Norton chose to perfect the sheets he had already printed rather than resuming the planned run of the outer forme and then perfecting both sub-impressions in a single operation. The motive would be to prioritize the completion of at least part of the planned impression of sheet A in order to get some complete sets of sheets to the publisher for sale. This strat- egy would make more sense if quire A came later, even last, in the sequence of quires as printed. However, if quire A came last and if therefore B followed D directly, the composition of B's outer forme (the first one printed in B) would have had to wait for the italic from D2r (in the second forme printed in D) to become available. This would leave the press idle, at least for purposes of machining ToP . If, instead, A followed D directly, its outer forme would still be standing from Phase I and printing could have proceeded on that while D was broken down and the types incorporated into A(i). So, the slightly more likely sequence for this second phase of printing was C-D-A(Phase IIa)-B. Probably Phase IIb of quire A came last, but it cannot have been delayed long because two of the three surviv- ing books that contain it also have Phase II of sheets B-D. The textual changes in quire A are minor for Phase II and would have had no bearing on a decision to leave the production of that quire for later. Possibly it came later in the sequence because that was the order followed in Phase I. Quire B, on the other hand, came into this phase with only one type-page intact; all the others had to be reset. So, it would have made sense to commence printing with quires C, D, and A, leaving time for the resetting of B. I have left quire "a" out of the discussion for this phase because it holds onto most of its original types throughout the production. We would normally expect it to come late in the series, probably after quires B and/or A(Phase IIa). C. PHASE III TABLE 33. Recurring type material in Phase III This phase began with the resetting of four pages, italic raids on two others, and some localized resettings. Only the inner forme of quire B was distributed before the next phase. Its donation of a distinctive bracket to C1v shows that C(i) was composed after B(i) had finished printing. This is the only evidence for work sequence that recurring type-matter affords in Phase III. (Of course Norton's and Okes' typesettings of quire D did not share any material.) Italic raids before this phase point to a continuing need for english italic for another job; the distributed material does not reappear in reset portions of ToP. D. PHASE IV TABLE 34. Recurring type material in Phase IV Both Norton's and Okes' quires D continue intact from the preceding phase, and most of sheets A-C also enter Phase IV unchanged except for localized reset- tings to accommodate revisions and resulting page-break changes. The exception is quire B inner forme, which was entirely reset. As usual, there is no obvious reason why Norton reset this forme and not others. But table 34 shows that some of the types from the first page of text (A1r) turn up again in the two last pages— B3V and 4r—of the newly set B(i). So, A(o) was already printed and being dis- tributed before B(i) was ready for the press. A single letter " a " shows that Norton printed sheet D and distributed some of its type before resetting three lines on B3r. Therefore—if we again take sheets to be the units of production—both A and D preceded B through the press. Quire C contains no distinctive types that allow us to place it in a sequence, and again the few changes to quire "a" are insufficient to establish links with any other. The sequence, then, was A-D-B, with the positions of C and "a" unknown, though as usual we would expect the preliminaries to come last. Though the evidence of recurring types is very incomplete, it shows that Nor- ton distributed at least portions of quires A and D while other quires remained to be composed. It looks as if Norton knew that he had reached the end of the pro- gram and there was no point in leaving type standing against further reprints. Some type-matter distributed from Phase III found its way into reset passages in Phase IV: TABLE 35. Recurring type material between Phase III and IV It appears that the types freed up by the distribution of B(i) after Phase III still lay near the top of their boxes, available for picking up for Phase IV alterations in quire A. This implies a rather short delay, or none at all, between Phases III and IV. A different case is the singleton leaf bearing "A speech to the King and Queenes Maiesties", surviving in four copies of the final phase. It is set mostly in Norton's italic i-1. I could identify none of its types with those used in the rest of the book in any phase. This lack of recurrence is not too surprising, given the small sample size, but it would also be consistent with a significant passage of time between the distribution of ToP 's main text and the setting of "A Speech". During this period, the ToP types might get deployed on other jobs or covered in the boxes by other types more recently distributed, making them less likely to be picked for setting the new epilogue. §10. Skeleton Formes The patterns of transfer of the visible parts of the skeleton can sometimes yield information about the progress of formes through the press. In ToP , the only identifiable recurring components of the headlines are the page numbers and their surrounding parentheses. The pagination of the book is [i-iv], 1–8, 2 i -24; as quires A and B have duplicate pagination, whole headlines could potentially have been transferred between them without change. The digits themselves provide scanty evidence for the re-use of skeletons: though the workman imposing the forme might have recycled digits from previous pages, the types would have tended to shuffle positions randomly, and it is often difficult to tell whether one of them is damaged or is just another design variation in Norton's heterogeneous stock. Pairs of parentheses, on the other hand, occur on every page and could very easily be re-used along with the surrounding spacing material that held the number more or less centered. Being long, thin lines, parentheses are prone to damage, and particularly in the case of a battered stock like Norton's, they ac- quire an individuality that bibliographers can take advantage of. In my catalogu- ing of those in ToP , I relied on visibly injured individuals, but made no attempt to classify the infinite variations among the sound examples that could result from different cuttings, variations in inking and impression, or even inversions. A. PHASE I In §9A, I showed that the sheets in Phase I were probably printed in the order B-C-D-A-a. The preliminaries do not participate in the sharing of visible skeleton formes, and in the following table I have arranged the other formes in my proposed order of printing. In this and the subsequent tables, the codes fol- lowing the page references stand for pieces of type. The abbreviations L, R, and # indicate left and right parentheses and the digit(s) they enclose. A code "L#R" signifies that the headline was transferred unaltered from a page earlier in the printing. An "x" indicates an individual type that is undoubtedly different from the one in the previous appearance of the headline; a question mark means that the type is not distinctive enough to tell whether it is the same or different. For example, in the table below, the left parenthesis from B1v recurs on C1v; the page number changes from 2 to 10, so neither of the two digits can be the same types; and the right parenthesis might be the same one from B1v, but I could not verify this. The same left parenthesis then migrates to D2v, where again the the following digit of the page number changes from 1 to 2 (hence "x"), and the next zero and right parenthesis could be the same types from C1v but are not distinctive enough to tell. So, all we can say definitely about these two transfers is that the left parenthesis is conserved. We cannot say even that the transfer was direct from one forme to the other; the headline could have been distributed and the type coincidentally picked off the top of the pile in the case for setting the new headline. In the first scenario, the action is deliberate and systematic, in the second it is unconscious and random. There is perhaps a tendency for types to remain in the same position in the new forme; codes printed in boldface in the following tables signify pages on which the type material recurs in the same quarter as in its immediately previous use. TABLE 36. Recurrence of headline types in Phase Ia—b The appearance of Phase I is not one of particular regularity. Every identifi- able parenthesis switches at least once between outer and inner formes during the printing history. A slightly puzzling feature is the rapid re-use of certain types, at the transitions marked by the dashed vertical lines. For instance, the left parenthesis on C1v (inner forme) recurs immediately in D2v (outer). Since outer formes of ToP sheets were always printed before the inner ones, this proximal re-use means that the imposition of D(o) had to wait for the machining and strip- ping of C(i) to receive some of the latter's headline. If presswork were proceeding smoothly, it would have avoided a bit of delay to take D outer's skeletons from C(o), or from somewhere else further back in the production. The same sharing occurs with two types between D(i) and the next following forme, A(o). These "pinch points" suggest small delays in the workflow after quires C and D, pos- sibly to accommodate other jobs or even some of the composition of ToP itself. We can eliminate some of these points if we drop the assumption that the order of printing is the same as the order of composition and rearrange the quires in the table above; but no arrangement gets rid of them entirely. The parentheses that start their journey on B4v travel through all four quires of the main text, remarkably ending up on A4v with the same damaged "8". (My notation system cannot show that particular coincidence.) Because quires C and D intervened, this distinctive type could not have travelled with the parentheses, but was evidently put aside, or back into the case, after B(o) was printed, and randomly retrieved for use in A(o). B. PHASE II TABLE 37. Recurrence of headline types in Phase II Type-recurrence analysis (§9B) shows that the order of printing the quires in this phase was probably C-D-A(Phase IIa)-B-A(Phase IIb). Table 37 follows this order. In comparison with Phase I, Phase II seems to have proceeded in a much more orderly fashion. Recurring characters leapfrog adjacent formes, so that any one piece of type will appear only in the outer or the inner, and always in the same quarter of the chase (as shown by the bold typeface in the table). All three characters of the A2v headline, including the page number, recur on B2v. It is odd not to find any headline material from quire C participating in a transfer, as all of its pages were either reimposed or completely reset after it was printed. Quire A was printed in two distinct stretches of work, Phases IIa and IIb. After the first of these, the skeletons were stripped from five of its eight pages. Table 37 shows that A(o) in Phase IIa shares much of its headline material with the corresponding pages of B(o). When A(o) went back on the press for Phase IIb, all of its headline material was new. By the time I realized this, the three copies of A(IIb) were not easily accessible and I was unwilling to exasperate my colleagues with yet more requests for images. Therefore, I have no specific information on the headlines of A(IIb). C. PHASE III In §9C, I was unable to find evidence for the sequence of printing the quires in this phase, so I tabulate them here in alphabetical order: TABLE 38. Recurrence of headline types in Phase III This phase shows regular patterns of movement of headline material between quires A and C, and B and D. Once again the printer either did not have or did not take the opportunity to transfer the page numbers intact between sheets A and B. The re-use of material between B(i) and C(o) would create a "pinch point" if Norton followed the order shown, because the imposing of C(o) would have had to wait until B(i) was off the press, cleaned, and stripped. There are several ways of reordering the quire sequence to place comfortable intervals between the re-uses shown in the table: repeating Phase II's order of C-D-A-B would be one of them. But as we lack evidence of recurring types in the text, the most we can say is that it is slightly more likely that Norton printed the quires out of sequential order, but we do not know what that order might have been. The five surviving copies from Phase IIIb are characterized by unique page- number settings in the outer forme of quire B. Their typographic material shows no distinctive forms that occur elsewhere in Phase III. Okes could conceivably have transferred some headine material between the two formes of his quire D. Visual inspection shows no evidence of this, partly because because his type was more uniform and in much better condition than Norton's and the parentheses are too regular to show useful differences. D. PHASE IV From the evidence presented in §9D we know that the printing of sheet A in Phase IV preceded that of quire B. This phase is unique in having all the headlines from A(i) transferred intact to the same-numbered pages in B(i). We would expect a similar transfer between the outer formes, but this did not oc- TABLE 39. Recurrence of headline types in Phase IV cur. Norton's printing of quire D carries over its headlines from Phase III, and quire C has only two new headlines in eight pages, with none of their material used elsewhere. Okes' headlines remain with their type-pages, unchanged from Phase III. In conclusion, the patterns of headline re-use during the ToP printing history show that Norton's men took only partial advantage of this potentially labor-saving practice. This lack of regularity might be interpreted as evidence of a chaotic work-flow, but in fact, it is not that common to find any book of the period to be completely regular in this respect, and many show no headline re-use at all. The limited evidence of the practice in ToP gives the appearance that Norton settled into a slightly more systematic routine as he worked through the impressions. GATHERING THE SHEETS Now that we have laid out the evolution of each page of ToP and considered how the pages shared typographic material in their progress through the several phases of printing, we will examine how the various states group themselves together in formes and sheets, and how the finished sheets were gathered into copies ready for folding and binding. Earlier investigators (notably Unger, Jack-son , and Greg ) were perplexed by the range of permutations of states in copies of ToP that they examined. They attempted to explain some of the complexity as resulting from duplicate settings run off concurrently to satisfy the expected high demand for the text. While this was true diachronically—Norton did, in fact, set many of the pages more than once through the various phases—it is not true synchronically: different settings were not in production simultaneously except for Norton's and Okes' quire D. Instead, surviving copies show a degree of ho- mogeneity consistent with separate phases of printing the whole book, each phase yielding a discrete batch of complete copies that left the establishment before the products of the next phase could mix with them. The uncommon exemplars that show mixing between phases can be attributed to slightly unequal supplies of in- dividual sheets at the time of collation, requiring some copies of a given phase to be completed with products of the previous or following one. 36 The ensuing dis- cussion will refer to appendix 3, and it assumes that the proportions of surviving 36. Any number of accidents—spoilage at the press, damage or loss before gathering, miscounting, etc.—would make it unlikely for a given job to end up with exactly the same number of sheets of each signature. copies of the various states shown in the table bear some statistical relationship to the numbers that were originally printed. I have found no evidence that Norton treated the products of any one phase with particular favor, nor do I have any reason to suppose that different versions had different rates of survival. §11. Phase I Appendix 3 shows that eighteen of the nineteen copies surviving from Phase I (about 95%) are homogeneous throughout (ignoring stop-press corrections). In other words, they contain the earliest settings or impositions of all the sheets including the preliminaries. The one exception is Huntington 69434, in which quire D comes from the next printing. This is an example of the situation just described in which one quire was evidently printed a bit short in one phase and had to be completed from the next. There is nothing special about quire D that might have led to a short printing; recall from our type analysis that it was prob- ably printed third of the five quires in Phase I. If quire D was printed short, it seems that quire "a" was printed long. In addition to the nineteen complete copies from Phase I, four copies from the second printing have Phase I preliminaries. This extrapolates to a 21% surplus of first-printing quire "a"—an odd amount, being too little to represent an in- tended second impression but too large to have resulted from a trifling accidental overrun. The discrepancy persists in Phase II, in which each quire survives in approximately equal numbers, but a residue of preliminaries is pushed over into Phase III copies. In Phase III, Norton apparently shorted the run of quire "a" by a number about equal to the initial overrun, so Phase IV copies are finally homogeneous (if we disregard Okes' contribution)–all "third impression" title pages come with text sheets from the last printing. The phase relationship of quire "a" with the main text looks like this: TABLE 40. Staggered distribution of production phases of quire "a" The first two impressions of the preliminaries may occur with either of two impressions of quires A-D, and the second and third printings of the main text can each come with two possible variants of the title page. It was this ladder-like asynchrony that led earlier bibliographers to believe that Norton had printed simultaneous duplicate settings of the text. In a given copy, we should not necessarily expect early stop-press variants of any one sheet to sort with early states of the others, or later with later, though there may be a tendency for this to happen. 37 Appendix 3 indeed shows an es- sentially random pattern in this regard. §12. Phase II Phase II represents a print run that was probably smaller than the first; there are ten survivors, as opposed to nineteen for the first printing. The phase is com- plicated by the two sub-phases of sheet A, the products of which consort with the other sheets of the book in contrasting ways. Sub-phase IIa is found only with Phase II of sheets B-D, and it sometimes occurs with the residue of Phase I prelimi- naries. Sub-phase IIb, on the other hand, comes only with Phase II prelimi- naries, and one copy (Folger STC 22459.2) even has quires B-D from the third phase. These groupings support my earlier assertion that Phase II consists of two batches of copies that left the shop at different times, or were at least sequestered so they could not intermix. The A sheets may have been a bit over-printed, as evidenced by the Folger copy that is hybridized with Phase III. TABLE 41. Schematic contents of copies with quire A from Phase II 37. Joseph Dane , "Perfect Order and Perfected Order". Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 90.3 (Sept. 1996 ), 272–320. §13. Phase III This is the phase where the quire D sheets printed by Nicholas Okes first make their appearance, in 41% of the surviving copies from that phase. Most, though not all, copies come with the title page omitting the words "of Grayes Inne". During the course of Phase III we see the skeleton changes to the outer forme of quire B that define Phase IIIb of that sheet, as discussed in §6. The following table shows the composition of Phase-III copies. The patterns of association, based on a very small sample size, are at particular hazard of be- ing broken by new copies of ToP that may happen to emerge, and the following discussion need to be read with that caveat in mind. TABLE 42. Schematic contents of copies with quires B—D from Phase III Three copies with quires C and D from Phase III (shaded above) contain quire "a" from the previous phase, and one of these also has quire A from the previous phase. Because of their residual Phase-II content, they are likely to have been among the first exemplars from Phase III to be gathered into complete cop- ies. Two of these three copies contain Norton's quire D and one has Okes'. This statistically equal representation is consistent with my earlier conclusion that the two men's sheets were effectively printed "simultaneously", so were about equally available to use in any copy of Phase III. In §6B, I discussed an imposition of B(o) that I called Phase IIIb. The five copies containing it show some puzzling patterns in their makeup. In most re- spects they behave like normal copies from Phase III. However, none of them has quire "a" from the earlier phase, and all five have quire D in Norton's printing. The first point is not especially surprising, given the rarity of Phase III copies with quire "a" from Phase II. On the other hand, if Norton's and Okes' printings of quire D were equally available to make up those five copies, the probability of their ending up only with Norton's is 1/32, or about 3%; so perhaps this does call for some explanation. In §6B, I argued that Phases IIIa and IIIb of B(o) were perfected in one run with the same inner forme. In the resulting stack(s) of sheets, the two sub-phases would probably have remained separate strata. Hanging the sheets up to dry could have led to some intermixing of the two states, but by the time Phase III copies were assembled, the two sub-phases of sheet B might still have had enough spatial segregation to create dissimilar patterns of association. If, for example, the IIIb's ended up in a remote stack and were retrieved late in the collation process, and if the supply of Okes' quire D had arrived somewhat before Norton's and was exhausted first, there could be a tendency for Phase IIIb of sheet B to end up with the remainders of Norton's quire D. But we cannot draw any conclusions about what happened, and with the discovery of more copies the pattern shown in table 42 could easily fall apart and we would have something different to explain. Phase IIIb of forme B(o) also associates with unique states of forme C(i) and page D1r: C1v has the page number and parentheses displaced about 2 mm to the right with respect to other copies of Phase III. On C4r, in the same forme, the page-number types have moved 4 mm to the right. In both these cases the page-number materials are unchanged except in position, and there is nothing to indicate whether the states are earlier or later than their Phase III cohorts. On D1r, the italic signature mark " D " shows three possible positions in the Phase IIIb copies: 2a1: Under the "hi" of "white," in the last line. This is the normal position in Norton's Phase IIIa copies, but it is also found in the Phase IIIb copy at the Bristol Central Library. Line 10 has the misprint "Masqncrs". 2a2: Under the comma. "Masquers" is now correctly printed, so this state is later than the preceding, and the handling required to make the correction may be sufficient to explain the signature-mark shift. The state is uniquely associated with Phase IIIb of B(o), occurring in three of the five copies. 2a3: Under the "w". Line 10 also has "Masquers". This state is found in the Newberry copy of Phase IIIb, but also in all of Norton's Phase IV sheets, so it is evidently the latest of the three. Its presence in the Newberry copy prob- ably results from a slightly short run of quire D which had to be made up from Phase IV. The materials and alignments of the headlines are invariant in all of these states. The five copies containing Phase IIIb of quire B are already unusual in their B(o) skeleton, but the association of that skeleton with unique states in two other quires is unsettling. I cannot imagine an event happening during the printing of one sheet that would manifest itself at about the same point during the printing of another. The arbitrary realignments in quires C and D are reminiscent of St. Catharine's College Z59, with its unique page-number placement on B4v (§6B); but here they coincide with the unique skeleton settings of B(o). Three of the seven states that appear during this sub-phase improve the readings found in their Phase III cohorts, 38 though another (B2v:2c2) actually introduces a textual corruption that persists through Phase IV. One is tempted to suggest that the copies containing Phase IIIb of quire B are witnesses to a separate production phase of the entire book, with no changes except the reset skeleton of forme B(o), corrections to D1r, and incidental shifts on C(i). (There were later deliberate changes and attendant shifts on B2v, B4r, and D1r.) How the five IIIb copies 38. These are B4v:2c2 and D1r:2a2 and -3. came to combine all these unusual features is, to my mind, ToP 's greatest remain- ing mystery. §14. Phase IV The latest copies of ToP —those which the title page calls "the third impres- sion"—comprise the most homogeneous group in the whole publication history. Of the 27 pages in quires "a" and A-C, 24 have settings, impositions, or vari-ant states that are unique to this printing. 39 The sheets of quire D printed by Norton for this phase are characterized by state D1r:2a3, whereas his output for Phase III contains D1r:2a1–2. (The latest state of that page also occurs in the Newberry copy, one of the five from Phase IIIb discussed in the preceding section; but we can probably regard this as another instance of an earlier-phase copy that had to be completed with a quire from the next phase.) No unsophisti- cated copy of Phase IV contains sheets from earlier printings, if we except Okes' quire D, which I have argued was likely the product of two separate print runs that are now indistinguishable. The single-leaf "Speech to the King and Queenes Maiesties," alluding to the second performance of 13 February, is bound into four of the nine traceable copies of Phase IV. Its placement among the sheets would probably have been at individual binders' discretion. As a sort of dedication, it could logically belong at the end of the preliminaries after Shirley's original dedication; or, as it referred to an event later than the first performance documented by the book, it could come last. The copies I have seen show two in the first location and two in the other (and Greg reported that his copy had it bound after quire a.) Being a singleton, it would have been prone to loss, and one does not know whether it was originally included with the sheets of all Phase-IV copies or whether it was available only for those sold later. I could not find any of its damaged types elsewhere in the book, so there is no obvious evidence that it was set soon after the last phase of printing. In §16, I will give archival evidence that might have a bearing on the addendum, but from the physical evidence it is not possible to say anything with greater certainty. §15. A Digest of the Workflow In this section I attempt a narrative of the entire production cycle of ToP . It follows the order of printing the quires in each phase as far as I have been able to determine. "Distributed" means the entire page was broken down and the type put back in the cases. "Stripped" means that the skeleton (always the headlines, and generally the direction lines as far as I can tell) was removed—either for distribution or for transfer to another forme—leaving the bare type-pages to be tied up for later impression. "Replaced" means that the tied-up pages, complete with their previous skeletons, were newly imposed for reimpression. When all the pages of a forme were replaced unaltered, I would not rule out the possibility that they were still locked in their chase when set aside. 39. The three exceptions are B2v:2c2 (which had made its first appearance in Phase IIIb, as just mentioned), a2r:1b2, and C3r:2b. As it is difficult to assign a significance to transfers of individual types in skel- etons, I have mentioned only cases where two or more types in a cluster seem to have been moved together. A. PHASE I As I demonstrated in §9A, the quires were likely printed in the order B-C- D-A-a. Quires B and C have different measures and could have been composed simultaneously. Quire "a" has the same measure as quire B and was possibly composed with the same stick. English-sized type (20 lines = 96 mm) is used for the text throughout. B outer forme Pauses for correction: one, affecting B1r only: heading reset with characters' names in roman. The same page later incurs damage to ll.7 up and 9 up. After printing: the stack of sheets is flipped in a non-standard but explainable way (§6A), scrambling the states during the perfecting run. All pages are distrib- uted except B3r, which is stripped and kept standing. One piece of type from B4V reappears in D(o), and parentheses from the B4V headline are transferred to the headline of C4r. B inner forme Pauses for correction: one: one comma added to B3v, two to B4r. After printing: all pages distributed. One identified type reappears in D(o). C outer forme C4v has an egregiously cock-eyed lockup, the last lines of text bending up- ward into a hole left by the omission of some spacers; page number 16 is mis- printed "61". Pauses for correction: three, eventually affecting all of the pages; one change deletes a stage direction on C3r After printing: all pages stripped. The italic songs on C2v, C3r, and C4v are removed and distributed, presumably for use in another job but certainly not for ToP; the remainder of the text is kept standing. The fact that C(i), an even richer source of italic, remains untouched in this wave of raids shows that the songs in C(o) may have been taken while C(i) was on the press and inaccessible. The unperfected sheets are shuffled in an unexplained manner that results in an anomalous distribution of the two states of the inner forme. C inner forme C4r headline gets its parentheses from B4V Pauses for correction: one, correcting a spelling on C1v. After printing: distributed: C3v, and C2r except most of ll.5–9. Other two pages stripped and kept standing. At least one type from the C1v headline is transferred to D2v in that quire's outer forme. That is the next one on the press, so printing on D(o) probably follows a short delay. Headline parentheses are also transferred from C4r to D3v (both on inner formes). Some time before the next phase, C4r l.10 and C1v italic and brackets in ll.8–10 and last three lines are removed and distributed. D outer forme Pauses for correction: one: a word added to D1r, making better sense but dis- turbing the first three lines in the process. A bit of type damage takes place later on D4V, and still later on the previously disturbed lines of D1r. After printing: all pages kept standing with their skeletons. The unperfected sheets are shuffled in an unexplained manner that results in an anomalous distribution of the three states of the inner forme. This quire is printed a little short. D inner forme D3v gets its parentheses from C4r. Pauses for correction: one, fixing a typo and a misalignment. It is possible that a small number of sheets printed with D(o) are not perfected in this phase, but are perfected with the inner forme characteristic of Phase II. (See the discussion of B.L. Ashley 1697 in §8A.) After printing: D4r distributed, the rest stripped. Some headline material is transferred to A(o). That is the next forme of ToP to go onto the press, so the transfer probably causes at least a short delay in presswork. Some time before the next phase, sections of italic are removed from D1v, D2r, and D3v, to be used at least partly for setting quire "a". Remainder of text kept standing. A outer forme A4v gets its parentheses from D3v (same position in forme). Pauses for correction: none. After printing: distributed: A1r ll.1–9 and the last; A4v ll. 1–2. Remainder of text stripped and kept standing. Some time before the next phase, four lines of italic on A2v-3r are also distributed. A inner forme Pauses for correction: three, affecting spelling and commas. After printing: A1v and bottom half of A2r distributed (from "These moving forward ..." to end); other pages stripped and kept standing. "a" The dedication (pages a2r-v) contains italic raided from D2r and 4r. All three pages of preliminaries are imposed together and printed by work-and-turn. There is no evidence of the use of bearer types on blank a1v. Most likely, each sheet is perfected immediately. Pauses for correction: one, correcting a typo on a2v. Part-way through the cor- rected state, the "O" in l.3 of the title page suffers damage. After printing: acorns and direction line stripped on a2r, otherwise all type- pages kept standing. The number of sheets printed, on the evidence of surviving copies, is about 20% greater than those of the other quires. At this point, the products of Phase I either leave Norton's shop or are pack-aged and remain unmixed with later printings. A few sets of sheets apparently linger without quire D, which was printed a bit short. Meanwhile, composition is proceeding on another unidentified job or jobs which cause italic passages to be removed from the standing type in quires A, C, and D. B. PHASE II The sequence of quires in this phase is less certain than for Phase I (see §9B). The history is complicated by the two sub-phases of quire A, and there is no evidence for the position of quire "a" in the sequence because after Phase I it has no typographic interaction with the other quires. I have placed it last below, as it was normal to print the preliminaries after finishing the text. C outer forme Preparation for printing: italic songs on C2v, 3r, 4v reset. On the latter page, Song 5 and its title are set in pica (20 lines = 82 mm, with the title in roman; the title "Song 3" on C3r is also in pica). All new skeletons. The distortion of the last line on C4v is remedied. The use of pica type on C4v probably indicates a shortage of the english size, which is the default for ToP. The use of pica roman for the title "Song 5." may be deliberate, to match the type of the song itself; but it also creeps into the title on C3r, where the song itself is reset in english. Pauses for correction: none. The page number on C1r shows some looseness. After printing: all pages stripped and kept standing. None of the headline mate- rial shows up in the other quires. C inner forme Preparation for printing: C1v (italic and brackets, ll. 8–10, and last three lines) and C4r l.10 reset. Other minor adjustments to 3v and 4r. All pages reimposed with new skeletons. Pauses for correction: none. After printing: C1v: italic and brackets in ll. 1–10 and last four lines distrib- uted. Otherwise, all pages stripped and kept standing. None of the headline material shows up in the other quires. D outer forme Preparation for printing: pages replaced along with their original skeletons. The damage to the first three lines of type on D1r, already disturbed, probably occurs at this point, producing state 1a3. If not, the damage happens early in the print- ing (§8A). Pauses for correction: none. After printing: D1r distributed; all other pages stripped and kept standing. Some headline material from D1r, 2v, and 4v is transferred to the same posi- tions in A(o). Some time before the next phase, two stretches of type are distributed: D2v ll.18 through the end of the page, and the italic song on D3r. D inner forme Preparation for printing: D4r reset; five-line stage direction at the top of D1v reset in roman; raided italic portions of D2r and 3v reset in the same italic font. All new skeletons. Pauses for correction: none. It appears that a residuum of sheets printed with the outer forme from Phase I are perfected with this batch. After printing: all pages stripped and kept standing except for the following, distributed: D1v (all); D2r italic song ll. 1–8 only; D3V roman section. Headline parentheses from D4r are transferred to A4r (inner forme). A outer forme Phase IIa Preparation for printing: the following are reset: A1r ll. 1–9 and last; A2v-3r, four lines of italic (set in great primer size, 20 lines = 120 mm.); A4v ll. 1–2. Textual revision to A3r. All new skeletons, including the rule on A4v, but omitting its catchword; the lines of acorns on A1r may be new. A2v headline gets its parentheses from D2v. Pauses for correction: none. The catchword on A2v goes gradually out of align- ment. Printing is halted before all sheets of this forme are machined. After printing: all pages stripped and kept standing. Some headline material from A1r, 2v, and 4v is transferred to the same positions in B(o). After a delay, apparently to allow other work to play through, it appears that Norton decides to perfect this partial run of sheet A rather than complete the Phase-II impression of outer-forme sheets. A inner forme Phase Ila Preparation for printing: A1v, and bottom half of A2r (from "These moving forward ...") reset. Commas added on A4r. All new skeletons, including the row of ornaments on A3v. A4r headline gets its parentheses from D4r. Pauses for correction: none. A4r shows looseness in l. 7. After printing: all pages kept standing: A1v stripped, the others with their skeletons. If Norton's strategy at this point is to rush out as many copies as he can with the partial run of sheet A, the logical next step is to machine the two remaining quires before returning to complete the impression of A: B outer forme Preparation for printing: B1r, 2v, 4V reset; B1r has 28 pairs of acorns, with two inverted. On B3r (reimposed), rewriting of the tavern direction from one to three lines forces the last four lines of type on this page onto the verso. B2V gets its entire headline from A2v. Pauses for correction: none. On B4v l. 2, the last two letters of "coold" are lost in two stages. After printing: all pages stripped and kept standing. B1r loses its acorns along with the page number. The four overflow lines of type from B3r are respaced to three lines and transferred to B3v, which is therefore probably being reset at this point. B inner forme Preparation for printing: all pages reset. B3v starts with the three overflow lines of type from B3r, but the page break at the bottom is kept unaltered by reducing leading and running a stage direction into a dialogue line. Pauses for correction: one: page number on B4r is reset part-way through. There is a confused series of seemingly accidental variants (§6C). One copy also has page number on B2r set in a font not seen elsewhere. After printing: all pages kept standing with their skeletons. At this point Norton would be able to assemble a certain number of Phase-II copies using the remainder of quire "a" from Phase I. He might now return to print further copies of the preliminaries with some revisions: "a" Preparation for printing: title page realigned; direction line and acorn pairs (27) on a2r newly set; comma added on a2v. The forme is printed by work-and- turn. Pauses for correction: none. After printing: all pages kept standing. At this point Norton can assemble further complete copies, exhausting the supply of sheet A from Phase IIa. Unlike the previous batch, these copies all contain sheet "a" from Phase II. Now Norton returns to complete the Phase-II impression of sheet A: A outer forme Phase Ilb Preparation for printing: all new skeletons. A2v catchword marries with first line of roman on next page. (That is the third line of text, so the workman evidently overlooked the two short lines of italic that begin the page). Some quads left up on A4v. Pauses for correction: none. After printing: all pages kept standing: A3r and 4v with their skeletons, A1r and 2v without. A inner forme Phase IIb Preparation for printing: A1v gets new skeleton; other pages replaced with their skeletons, but A3v page number shifts. Pauses for correction: none. After printing: all pages kept standing with their skeletons. This brings the print run of quire A equal to those of the other text quires, and the last copies from Phase II can be sent to the warehouse, uniquely contain- ing quire A from Phase IIb. There may actually be a few copies of sheet A left over: one surviving copy from Phase III contains quire A from IIb. C. PHASE III The sequence of printing the quires in this phase is indeterminate, though rather more likely to have been in scrambled order. I give it here in the order A-B-C-D-a. A outer forme Preparation for printing: A1r and 2v get new headlines; A3r and 4v are replaced unaltered, but in the process the quads on A4V get lowered. Pauses for correction: one? On A3r, one copy shows displacement and damage at upper left, and slight displacement of the skeleton elements. Possibly during the act of repairing the damage, the "3" goes missing from the signature mark. The page number on A1r prints indistinctly or not at all. After printing: all pages kept standing: A4V probably keeps its headline but loses the rule; the others are stripped. A inner forme Preparation for printing: all pages replaced unaltered. Pauses for correction: one: the famous "bride/bridle" correction on A1v. After printing: all pages stripped and kept standing. Some headline material appears in the same positions on C(i). B outer forme Phase IIIa Preparation for printing: all pages get new skeletons; B1r receiVes 25 pairs of acorns, with endpieces. Headline parentheses on B4V are the same as on D4v. In the process of reimposition, some disturbance and damage occur on B1r and 2v, and the catchword is left off of 4v. Pauses for correction: none. One copy shows a page-number shift on B4V. After printing: all pages stripped and kept standing. B1r loses its acorns along with the page number. This printing of B(o) is somewhat short with respect to the other text quires in Phase III—something prevents Norton from machining the full white-paper stack. He will complete it when he has dealt with whatever has caused the inter- ruption. Meanwhile, he strips the outer forme of B and puts it aside. The situ- ation is similar to the interruption in the run of quire A in Phase IIa, but here only the outer forme is affected and both sub-phases are backed up with the same state of the inner forme. Once again it is illogical for Norton to strip the skeletons if he expects to resume presswork soon. Nevertheless, after a presumably short delay, it appears that B(o) gets reimposed and put back on the press for a short completing run, which constitutes Phase IIIb of the outer forme: B outer forme Phase IIIb Preparation for printing: all pages get new skeletons; B1r gets 28 pairs of acorns, all properly oriented. Typo on B1r gets corrected. The tavern direction on B3r is rewritten from three lines to one again and positioned flush right. Pauses for correction: one: on B4V the word "stndy" in l.13 is corrected, after a fashion, by turning the "n" upside-down. Perhaps as an accident during this operation, the comma after " Laughter ' on B2V, l.23, goes missing. After printing: all pages kept standing; B2v keeps its skeleton, the others are stripped. B1r loses its acorns along with the page number. Phases IIIa and IIIb of B(o) are now perfected together: B inner forme Preparation for printing: all pages reimposed along with their skeletons. Pauses for correction: none. After printing: all pages distributed. Headline parentheses on B3V are the same as on C2v, which indicates that either C(o) does not follow B(i) directly, or there is a short delay between the stripping of B(i) and the imposition of C(o). The five surviving copies containing B(o) from Phase IIIb all contain Norton's printing of quire D, and most show displacements of skeleton types on C(i) and D(o). I am not able to explain the coincidence of these particular variants in this cohort. C outer forme Preparation for printing: all pages reimposed with new skeletons. C2v shares some headline material with B3v. Pauses for correction: none. After printing: all pages kept standing with their skeletons. C inner forme Preparation for printing: C1v: italic and brackets in ll. 1–10 and last four lines reset, dropping the third line from the bottom; the italic is face i-i; first letter of "Invention" lowercased, l.6 up. C2r reset except for most of ll. 5–9. C3V reset, with italic sections in alternative face i-2. Some respacing on C4r. Pauses for correction: none. For reasons still unclear, the copies bound with B(o) in Phase IIIb show page-number shifts on C1v and C4r (side-by-side in the forme), and the comma at the end of C4r l.6 shifts right. After printing: all pages kept standing, C1v and 4r with their skeletons, C2r and 3v without. By this point in the production, Norton eVidently has made an arrangement with his partner Nicholas Okes to divide the job of printing quire D. (For the possibility that Okes was an unwitting collaborator, see §8B.) Okes composes his own setting of those eight pages using his own type. Each man then prints roughly equal numbers of the quire for Phase III. Some of each man's sheets are gathered with Phase II of the preliminary quire, in which "of Grayes Inne " still appears on the title page after Shirley's name; one of these copies, with Okes ' quire D, also contains Phase IIb of quire A. From these groupings, it appears that each man's production was equally available for assembling the first copies from Phase III, so their work on this quire was effectively simultaneous. D outer forme (Norton) Preparation for printing: D1r reset. D2v ll. 6–7 respaced to one line, and bot- tom half of page reset beginning with l.17. Italic portion of D3r reset in alterna- tive italic i-2. On D4v, l.4 respaced. New skeletons all around; D4v shares some headline material with B4v. Pauses for correction: one, correcting spelling and punctuation on D1r and ap parently causing a signature-mark shift. After printing: all pages kept standing with their skeletons. This printing of quire D is probably a bit short, as one surviving copy from Phase III was apparently completed with quire D from Norton's final state (D1r:2a3). D inner forme (Norton) Preparation for printing: D1v reset. D2r ll. 1–8 reset in the default italic (i-1). D3v roman section reset, and the word " Proclayming ", l. 4 up, gets a lowercase first letter (incorrectly, as it follows a period). D2r, 3v, and 4r are reimposed with headlines set in pica size; D4r lacks catchword, and word-spacing of l. 3 and last three lines shifts a bit. Because the headline on D1v is a different size from those of the other three pages, it was evidently set in a different operation, probably during the resetting of the text. The use of pica for the other headlines could indicate a shortage of english-sized numerals and parentheses, but more likely the workman simply dipped into the wrong case. The direction lines of all four pages are set in the correct size. Pauses for correction: none. After printing: all pages kept standing with their skeletons. Quire D (Okes) Preparation for printing: all pages newly set. Pauses for correction: none. After printing: all pages kept standing with their skeletons. Some complete copies of the book are probably made up at this point, using up the leftover preliminaries from Phase II and containing Okes ' and Norton's quire D indiscriminately. "a" Preparation for printing: "of Grayes Inne ," is removed from the title; motto re- spaced to two lines to compensate; spacing of imprint slightly disturbed. a2v loses the rule below the signature, which may therefore have been treated as part of the skeleton. The headline, however, is unchanged. On a2r, leading is adjusted around l.5 of the heading, moving the line closer to the succeeding one. In the process, the loss of a spacer after "and" in l.3 causes a gradual rightward drift of the first two words in the line. The forme is printed off by work-and-turn. Pauses for correction: none. After printing: on a2v, "The humblest ... Shirley." stripped; all pages otherwise kept standing unaltered. On the evidence of surviving copies, quire "a" has a print run sufficient to supply all copies from Phase III. The remainder of the third printing of ToP can now be collated and shipped. D. PHASE IV Products of this last phase of work are the most uniform. All copies have "The third impression" on the title page. Although most of the formes underwent ex- tensive alteration, or even resetting, before printing began on each, there were no stop-press alterations thereafter. The only complication is the existence, carried over from Phase III, of the two settings of quire D printed by Norton and Okes . These occur in eight and six surviving copies respectively. In light of the evidence that there were four main work phases, and B(o) and all of quire A seem to have had five printings each, we need to take Norton's final claim of three "impressions" with a grain of salt. We cannot know whether Nor- ton actually believed this, whether the various starts and stops in the work cycle caused him to lose count, or even what he understood as an "impression". In the period 1600–40 , the word was used on title pages essentially synonymously with "edition", but only one-fifth as often. One finds it most commonly on title pages of devotional works that went into many settings, like Arthur Dent's Plaine Mans Path-Way to Heaven; but the title pages of Shakespeare's second and third folios also identify them as later "impressions". Norton himself used the term in 1624 (STC 25090a, in a collaboration with Augustine Mathewes ), 1633 (23503), 1634 (twice, 3129a and 22459b [ ToP ]), and 1637 (20274); all of these except Triumph of Peace were completely new settings. It is likely that, in the case of ToP , Norton was basing his count of impressions on the changes of title-page wordings which would have been noticeable to contemporary readers: states 1a1 and 2, which contained "of Grayes Inne "; 1b, lacking those words; and ici and 2, the avowed third impression. Phase IV seems to have followed Phase III rather closely, as some types from distributed portions of III turn up in IV. These types evidently remained near the top of their compartments in the type case without moving off to other jobs. The recurring types within this phase (see §9D) show that quire B inner forme (which had been distributed after Phase III) was reset after the last copies of quire A outer forme came off the press; and D(o) contributed one type to B(o). For the account below I have followed the order A-C-D-B-a. In this phase, a new paragraph added to A2r causes a change of page breaks through the rest of the quire. A outer forme Preparation for printing: all pages reimposed; A4V probably retains its headline but gets a new rule and regains its missing catchword. A1r: heading slightly re- spaced and the leading removed between it and the text. A2V receives the last three lines of text from the preceding page, reset; its last two lines of type are moved to the top of A3r. A3r: one textual correction; last three lines removed and transferred, probably immediately, to A3v in the inner forme. A4v: last four lines from previous page reset and added at top; l.2 up, "variety" changed to "uariety". Pauses for correction: none. The text of ToP , especially in the later phases, shows struggles with the letters u and v. These resulted from orthographic changes taking place in the printing trade around 1630–35 . Prior to this, the two graphics were variants of the same letter, which was used to denote the sounds u and v indiscriminately. The letter took the v-form at the beginning of words and the u-form elsewhere. Hence the words "beauty" and "variety" used the graphics as we do today, while "every" and "unless" were rendered as "euery" and "vnlesse". Within the space of a few years, the English printing trade converted nearly universally to the modern us- age, but for some compositors this must have been a period of confusion. Thus on A4v of ToP in Phase IV we find, in the same line, the aberrant spellings "beavty" and "uariety". A inner forme Preparation for printing: on A2r, the addition of a new paragraph of three lines after the first one leads to the following dislocations: A2r: last three lines of text removed and distributed. (The text has already been incorporated, reset, on A2v in the outer forme.) For no apparent reason, the bottom half of this page is again reset from the line beginning "These mov- ing forward". (This same portion of text received an arbitrary resetting between Phases I and II.) A3v: receives the last three lines of type from A3r in the outer forme. These force the last four lines of type to the top of A4r. A4r: receives the four lines of type from A3v. These force out its last four lines, which have already been incorporated, reset, in A4v in the outer forme. There is one spelling change on A3v. New skeletons all around. Pauses for correction: none. After printing: headlines removed and transferred to B(i); the rest distributed. C outer forme Rewriting of the text on C1v and 2r leads to some altered page breaks. Preparation for printing: all pages restored with their skeletons from Phase III. C1r: four lines of roman at top reset in pica, perhaps to relieve crowding. C2v: first two lines removed and probably distributed; blank line added above direc- tion line to compensate. C4v: spelling correction. Pauses for correction: none. C inner forme Preparation for printing: text revised and shortened on C1v; to compensate, the setting of the first two lines on the next page is transferred in type to the bottom of this one. More revision to C2r, and two lines of text brought over from the verso in the outer forme (probably reset). C3v: improvements to spelling and leading. C4r: spelling correction. C1v and 4r retain their previous skeletons, though 4r shows a slight page-number shift; new skeletons for C2r and 3v. Pauses for correction: none. As in Phase III, both Norton and Okes contribute sheets of quire D to this final printing. The sequence below assumes that Okes machines his Phase-IV sheets in a separate printing, though his two impressions are indistinguishable. D (Norton) Preparation for printing: all pages replaced with their skeletons, but the signa- ture mark on D1r shifts about 5 mm to the left. This is the only feature distin- guishing this phase of Norton's quire D. Pauses for correction: none. D (Okes) Preparation for printing: all pages replaced with their skeletons. Pauses for correction: none. Apparently, some D sheets from this impression are used to complete copies from Phase III. B outer forme Preparation for printing: B2v replaced unaltered from the previous phase; the others get new skeletons. B1r gets a heading of 26 pairs of acorns with an end- piece on the right only. The bottom of B3r receives the first three lines of text from B3v, reset, apparently to relieve an imbalance; the tavern direction revised. B4v: last two lines of italic reset in pica. Pauses for correction: none. At various points during printing, the page numbers shift on B1r, B2v, and B4v. B inner forme Preparation for printing: all pages reset, with pica roman used for the directions for gentleman and beggars on B3v. Headlines transferred from A(i) with numbers unchanged. Pauses for correction: none. "a" Preparation for printing: title page: "The third impression." added above motto; probably as a consequence, leading adjusted elsewhere, and ll. 1, 4, and 7 re- spaced; the line "February the third, 1633 ." reset, with a period in place of the comma; "Gent." in authorship statement replaced with "of Grayes-Inne," , with accidental omission of the "Gent.". On a2v: "The humblest ... Shirley ." newly set. The forme is printed by work-and-turn. Pauses for correction: one, restoring "Gent." to the end of the authorship statement. "A Speech to the King and Queenes Maiesties" Printed an undetermined period after the main book, with no variant states found in five examples. It is not found in surviving copies from before Phase IV; I cannot say whether all copies from the last impression originally contained it. Phase IV of The Triumph of Peace brings us to the end of a process that left behind artifacts of a bibliographical complexity unsurpassed, in my experience, for a book of its modest length. Once the last copies were sold, the masque stayed out of print for the next two centuries. 40 §16. When, How Many, and How Fast? I have argued that the complexity of ToP shows the printer's response to a high but short-lived demand for a text, so it behooves us to ask: were they first put on sale, how many copies were printed, and how long did it take to print them? Although ToP is the most thoroughly documented stage production before 1640 , the archival record fails to give straightforward answers to these questions. The relevant documents are as follows: 41 17 October 1633 : a letter from Thomas Coke to his father Sir John mentions that the King had requested the masque "about a fortnight agoe". "Who is the poet or who makes the maske dance I doe not yet understand." 42 We do not know whether Thomas was simply not privy to the decision process, or whether the organizers had not yet picked their poet. But if his chronology can be trusted, the members of the Inns had only four months to find a writer, commission music, construct sets and costumes, learn the parts, and pull it all together. No wonder that Coke, in the same letter, reports "no law studied in the Ins of Court now all turnd dancing scools". Bulstrode Whitelocke , in his Memorials of the English Affairs , gives an even shorter timeline, dating the original idea ofthe masque to "about Allholantide"— so, around the beginning of November, with three months to prepare. 43 17 January 1634 : Shirley is admitted to membership in Gray's Inn . This honor is recorded on the earliest states of the title page of ToP , so it would seem to provide a terminus post quem for the first printing. However, I have suggested in my discussion of the title-page variants in §4A that Shirley's claim to the honor might have anticipated its actual granting, which created an embarrassment that led to the subsequent deletion of "of Grayes Inne " from the title pages of Phase II of the preliminaries. So, this timepoint could be less significant than it seems. It is possible, however, that his actual admittance was contingent on delivery of the completed manuscript. 24 January: the publisher William Cooke brings a copy of ToP to Stationers Hall for license and registry. The entry, signed by Cooke , reads "Entred for his copy under the hands of Master Attorney Sir John ffinch and Master weaver warden The maske of the four Inns of Court with the Sceane as it is to be presented before his Maiesty at Whitehall the third of ffebruary next ." (Finch was one of the eight members of the main committee overseeing the masque, and one of two from Gray's Inn . Edmund Weaver was the Stationers' Company official who recorded the entry.) The wording of the entry shows that the clerk, as we would expect, was looking at a manuscript rather than the printed book. It is entirely possible that Norton was already hard at work on ToP , but a scrupulous printer (which Norton was not) would have waited until entry was completed. 3 February (first performance): a warrant is issued for payment of £15 to " m r Sherley poett for the Masque in full of his gratuity". 44 Fifteen pounds re- presents the Middle Temple's quarter-share of the total amount: expenses for the masque were borne equally by the four Inns of Court. So, on the day of first performance, Shirley is authorized to be paid £60 in full for the text. However, a further warrant of 21 November 1634 requests £5 for Shirley on behalf of the Middle Temple, its share of a total additional payment of £20. 45 No reason is given for this warrant; either the the Inns decided on a bonus to the handsome original fee, or it involves compensation for writing the epilogue "A Speech to the King and Queenes Maiesties", which was added to copies of the last printing of ToP. In either case, we are still lacking pieces of the puzzle, for Shirley's eighteen- line addendum was certainly not worth one-third of the whole masque text. A general accounting of all expenses for the masque complicates matters further by recording a total of £100 paid to Shirley . 46 The accounts often present this sort of confusion. Even the second warrant's November date offers no evidence bearing on the printing of the epilogue, for the warrant belongs to a group of late settle- ments for services that were mostly rendered in February 1634 or earlier. John Finet , in his undated memoirs, 47 describes both performances of ToP and mentions "the description of the Maske since being printed". This seems to mean that the book was not finished even by the time of the second performance on 13 February. But drawing a definite conclusion from Finet's wording runs the risk of being over-literal. Between 3 and 13 February: Justinian Pagitt writes to his cousin Tremyll, 48 "I have sent you a booke of our Masque which was p re sented on munday last." So, the second performance had apparently not yet taken place. At the time of writ- ing, Pagitt was a member of the Middle Temple in his early twenties, and he rode in the procession introducing the first performance. We cannot say for certain that the "booke" he sent was a printed copy, but it would seem extravagant to prepare a 7500–word manuscript to send away to a cousin. All of the surviving eyewitness accounts focus on the visual and social aspects of the performance; none mentions the qualities of Shirley's text. 19 February: William Gawdy writes to his father Framlingham , sending him a copy of "the booke". 49 William , aged about 22, had used family connections to get a ticket to the second performance. Again it is not certain that he was sending a printed copy, but the combination with Pagitt's letter adds to the evi- dence that the book had come out at least by mid-February. If manuscripts were circulating, Pagitt and Gawdy would more likely refer to them as "copies" than as "books". 50 Furthermore, neither man is known to have had direct access to Shirley , and it was only from Shirley or the very few organizers of the event that complete transcriptions of the masque could legitimately have been had. (Even the actors would have received copies only of their own parts, with cues.) The circumstances of the masque made it ideal for publication, and it was in nobody's interest to cut into potential profit by encouraging scribal circulation. 21 November 1634 : John Herne, disburser of funds for the masque, issues a warrant for 25s. payable to " m r Wakelye —printer". 51 This figure represents the Middle Temple's quarter-share of a £5 payment to the book wholesaler (not printer) Thomas Walkley, who was evidently acting as middleman between the Inns and the publisher William Cooke . As with Shirley's fees, we do not know precisely what this payment was meant to cover, and the date of the warrant probably has little relation to the dates of services rendered. From a marketing standpoint, it would have been ideal to have the printed book available the day of the first performance, if not a few days before. Milit- ating against that were the short timeline from the conception of the masque to its performance and the inevitability of many last-minute changes, particularly in the procession. Whitelocke's memoirs tell of adjustments made to head off squabbles over matters like precedence and color schemes. 52 Such frictions must have been constant, especially in the staging of a masque that dealt so overtly with class conflict. 53 In §9A, I showed that the first impression of quire A, which 40. Note should be made, however, of an anonymous 1643 parody, The Tragedy of the Cruell Warre ( Wing 2011 ), which directly quotes some of the songs. The next printing of the full work was in William Gifford's collected Shirley of 1833 . A note by Alexander Dyce in this edition is worth citing as the first record of bibliographical engagement with the printed copies: "Three editions of this piece are now before me, all in 4to. and printed by John Norton for William Cooke in 1633 : the two earliest (their title pages leave us ignorant which of them issued first from the press) differ but very slightly from each other; ' The third impression' varies from them considerably in some passages" ( The Dramatic Works and Poems of James Shirley [ed. William Gif- ford ]. London : John Murray , 1833 , 6: [254]). 41.

This sequence probably reflects the order in which the sections arrived at Norton's shop. A professional like Shirley would first compose the more laborious liter- ary portion of his commission, then turn to the reportage. Small changes to the latter could be incorporated up to, and even during, the printing of the quire containing it. 54 Printed masques conventionally preface the main text with a description of the set design in the past tense, and the title page almost always gives an exact date of performance. These features create a framing device that presents the performance—usually the only one—as a fait accompli. This convention might have no more value in dating the publications than a condemned criminal's "last words", which might be already printed and available at the public execution. 55 But there is no more reason to suppose that masques were printed in advance of their performance than there is for any other type of dramatic text. Specifically, we have no evidence that the first printed ToP was available before or at the first performance, but we have good reason to believe that it came out shortly after- wards, even before the second performance. As to how many were printed, there is no archival record. In fact, we have almost no figures for the edition size of any early Stuart dramatic text. The only report for a play that I am aware of is 1500 copies for the second edition of Beau- mont's Philaster ( 1622 , STC 1682 ), but Peter Blayney cited this as an optimistic response to an unusually successful first edition, and therefore atypical. 56 David Bergeron found that the print runs for the Lord Mayors' shows in the 1630 s gen- erally ran 300–500, 57 but neither the genre nor the intended readership of these brief accounts compare closely with those of a play or masque. Edition sizes of non-dramatic works that emerge in archival sources vary widely, and since the 54. This occurs in ToP's quire A at four points in the printing history. In the early print- ings the procession contains a crowd of gentlemen on horseback each with two pages (A2r:30), and groups of four musicians between the chariots (A3r:25). The final printing expands this to "many" pages and groups of six musicians, as well as augmenting the Marshall's retinue by ten horsemen (A2r:24) and adding a group of beggars pursued by mastiffs. 55. For caveats on the use of this line of evidence see Lauren Shohet , Reading Masques (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 89, n. 28). Tracey Hill , in Pageantry and Power (Man- chester: Manchester University Press, 2010) discusses the same issues at length with regard to the Lord Mayors' shows—comparable in some ways to court masques—concluding, "It seems [...] that practice simply varied: in some years the books were distributed on the day and in others not" (p. 233). But there is no suggestion that they were made available beforehand; and indeed that would spoil the surprise. 56. "The Publication of Playbooks" in A New History of Early English Drama (ed. John D. Cox and David Scott Kastan ), p. 412 and n. 62. In this article he constructs a scenario involv- ing a play publisher, using a hypothetical print run of 800 copies. Blayney estimated the first edition of King Lear ( 1609 ) at 750 copies (more likely lower than higher) in The Texts of King Lear and their Origins ( Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1982 , p. 148, n.1), but this was only a very educated guess. 57. Thomas Heywood's Pageants ( New York : Garland, 1986 , p. 28). The specific print runs he cites, from the guild records, are 300 (for 1631 ), 300 ( 1632 ), 500 ( 1635 ), 500 ( 1638 ), and "three hundred bookes for ye Companie over and above ye number they were to have" (i639). motive for recording the numbers is often a disciplinary action for irregular print- ing, we need to exercise caution in treating the figures as normative. In the absence of relevant archival records we can draw our evidence only from the number of surviving exemplars. I have been able to locate 55 reason- ably complete copies of ToP (which I define as lacking no more than one quire). This represents an average of 13.75 copies per printing. I performed a survey of 39 editions of other individually printed masques catalogued in ESTC. These show an average survival rate of 10.64 copies per edition (σ = 5.84; in contrast to ToP, none of them shows evidence of reprinting from standing type). One is tempted, then, to suppose that ToP 's average print run was somewhat higher than average for a masque. It was also unique in running to four impressions; only Chapman's Memorable Maske , Campion's Discription of a Maske , Heywood's Loves Maistresse , and Daniel's True Discription of a Royal Masque went into a second edition before 1640 . We could extrapolate from our reasonably hefty sample to conjecture that the four printings of ToP yielded a total of about 1.3 ˙ 4 n copies, where n is the average print run for a masque and 1.3 is the factor by which the average print run of ToP appears to exceed that of an average masque. However, these figures rest on shaky foundations. For several reasons, ESTC often fails to list all known copies of an edition. This incomplete reporting could magnify the apparent disparity between ToP 's numbers and those of other masques which have not attracted as much scru- tiny. Even if the factor 1.3 is valid, the higher-than-average survival of ToP could be partly the result of higher retention rates due to the masque's contemporary fame. And because we have no good evidence for the normal print run of a masque, as- signing a value to n in the equation above is a very subjective process. The relative sizes of ToP 's four printings are also hard to fix. If we use quire C as the most stable marker of which phase a particular copy of ToP comes from, the numbers of survivors are 19, 10, 17, and 9 respectively. By the time I was reaching the 50-copy mark, I assumed that the relative distributions had stabi- lized. But I was surprised when, late in my investigations, several more copies of ToP emerged and most of them clustered in Phase III. This skewing of the data scuttled my preliminary conclusion that a large first printing was followed by three approximately equal but smaller ones. Is the spread in the survival rates of the four printings of ToP statistically significant? Suppose we assume that each production phase yielded the same number of copies. A random sample from the entire printing history should yield approximately equal numbers from each printing—again, 13.75 in our case. Out of a sample of 55, the chances of drawing 19, 10, 17, or 9 copies of any one print- ing would only be about 3, 6.6, 7.1, and 4% respectively. 58 So, the dispersion ap- 58. If we take the survivors of ToP as a random sample from the entire output of the four printings, and hypothesize that the printings were done in equal numbers and had equal chances of survival, the probability of the sample containing a given number of copies from any one phase is approximated by where n is the size of the sample (55), r is the number of copies from a given phase in the sample, p is the hypothetical frequency of that printing in the whole population (1/4), and q = 1–p (i.e., 3/4). pears significant, and we have reason to believe that the first and third printings were larger than the second and fourth, perhaps by a factor of 11/2 to 2. The temptation to estimate the print runs from these admittedly wobbly figures is a powerful one, as some of my respected predecessors have demon- strated with recourse to even skimpier data. I hope that the disclaimers above will safeguard any speculations I make from hardening into claims if they are quoted later. I will guess that the anticipation generated by the run-up to ToP 's performance led Walkley or Cooke to set the initial print order optimistically at 1200 copies. Perhaps they would have gone higher had it not been for the Stationers' Company restriction. The three remaining printings might have con- tained 750, 1000, and 750 copies respectively, yielding a total of 3700 copies, or 16,650 sheets. 59 The printed masque, to my thinking, was a nine-days' wonder that the text alone could not sustain once the impact of the public spectacle faded. How long did the interest last, and how long did it take Norton to produce the four printings? We can start by estimating the time required for the first printing. The initial setting contained about 24,800 ens of visible text type, not including skeletons and display text. Donald McKenzie , in his The Cambridge University Press 1696–1712 ( Cambridge : University Press, 1966 ), cites an exceptional typesetter who averaged about 10,600 ens per day over a five-week period in 1702, but a more normal rate was 6,300 ens for that compositor, and usually lower for other individuals. 60 In January 1634 , John Norton had two apprentices, the senior one having close to seven years' experience. 61 We have no evidence that he also employed a journeyman, but recall from �8B that a document dated one year later charged Norton and Okes with hiring illegal workmen unaffiliated with the Stationers' Company. This allegation makes it impossible to estimate the number and skills of workers that Norton could potentially put onto a job. But let us as- sume that either Norton or his senior apprentice, working flat-out, were capable of setting 10,000 ens per day. Based on this rate, the undistracted composing of ToP should have occupied two and a half man-days. So, typesetting should not have been a bottleneck in getting ToP onto the market. Presswork went slower than composing, for a comparable amount of text. In the case of the Cambridge Press, McKenzie found that "an output of well over 1000 perfected sheets a day from a full-press [employing two men] was quite regularly achieved and sustained for lengthy periods." 62 ToP comprised four and 59. This is not vastly higher than the number Greg used to illustrate a hypothetical case in his "Nightmare" article (p. 116) which Bentley would later seize on as the actual print run (see footnote 6). Greg derived his figure arbitrarily by doubling the maximum allowed edition size of 1500 copies. 60. 1: 120–121. 61. D. F. McKenzie , Stationers' Company Apprentices , 1605–1640 . They were Thomas Creake (bound 24 June 1627 , freed 3 Sept. 1638 ) and Henry Luther (bound 6 Sept. 1629 for seven years, freedom not recorded). Richard Phillips was bound by Joyce Lawe on 7 June 1630 and freed by Norton on 3 Feb. 1640 , but the date of his transfer is not known. A document of 1635 , listing apprentices beyond the legal limit shared by Norton and Okes, does not mention him ( W. W. Greg , A Companion to Arber , Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1967 , p. 328). 62. Cambridge , 1: 134. a half sheets. If we apply McKenzie's finding to my hypothetical figure of 1200 copies for the first printing of ToP , a full-press dedicated to the one job should have taken about five and a half days—just short of a regular work-week—to machine the nine formes of ToP , not counting the time to change the formes. If Norton delegated two men to the press and one man to composing (and distrib- uting, for the first italic raid), he should have been able to complete Phase I with a hard six-day week's work plus an extra day or so. Of course, preparing for the job—making design decisions, casting off copy, readying the paper, cutting frisket sheets, and the like—would have taken some additional time. But one can imagine Norton receiving copy as late as the day of registry—24 January—and, if necessary, having finished books from Phase I available very shortly after the first performance nine days later. The later printings, since they re-used standing type to varying degrees, de- manded much less composition time. Norton's shop set 24,800 ens for Phase I; Phase II involved the resetting of about 9680 ens, Phase III (including its sub- phases) 3960, and Phase IV 4110. Nicholas Okes had to set 6220 ens for his Phase III quire D; then his Phase IV was either an unaltered reimpression or was printed as part of Phase III. I have figured his total press time as the same either way. Using my thoroughly unreliable edition sizes, and the rates of work given above—setting 10,000 ens a day and printing 1000 sheets a day—and rounding up to the half-day, we arrive at the following approximate figures: TABLE 43. Estimate of minimum production time for all copies So, the entire production cycle of ToP required a little less than one man- week of composing, and somewhat less than three weeks at full-press. Of course these calculations cannot give an actual total. We assume, for instance, that com- posing and presswork often went on simultaneously—a sensible apportionment of labor in Norton's small shop would be two men printing and one composing. His partner Okes could have been working concurrently on his share, so his hours (though only less than two days) should not figure in the total time. And my estimates of the print runs could be too high. All of these factors would com- press the computed time required to print all the copies. It is worth noting that the imprint date remains 1633 in all four impressions. For this publication Nor- ton was using the legal calendar, in which the year date changed on Lady Day (25 March). If the fourth printing of the ToP preliminaries began after this day, he would have had some motivation for advancing the year date to emphasize the book's currency. But this would have been a small improvement, and we have seen that Norton's attention to detail was fitful at best. Still, we can say with some confidence that Norton could not have turned out all four impressions of ToP in less than three or four weeks. This is a best-case estimate, and I have not factored in some contingencies that must have dilated the history. For instance, besides the preliminary jobs al- ready mentioned (design, frisket cutting, etc.), I have omitted the time required to compose the title page, other display lines, and skeletons. Every setting or resetting implies a distribution; because that job can be put off indefinitely, or run concurrently with printing, I have ignored it in my calculations. Most impor- tantly, the later italic raids show that Norton had one or more other jobs in train along with ToP , as was normal in printing shops. Since I have not been able to identify these jobs, I cannot gauge their impact on the ToP history. The paper evidence, on the other hand, serves to constrain the timeline. I have assembled watermark information, in more or less detail, for three-fifths of the copies of ToP as well as (mostly single copies of) fourteen of the twenty-seven publications Norton put his name to in 1633 and 1634 . Among this group, ToP is almost unique in having one type of mark that I have not found named or described anywhere. In one version, it is a fat spindle with pointed or slightly rounded terminations; in the other, one end of the spindle is either a full semi- circle or softly flattened into a broad but still curved base, the other end being pointed. (Figure 4 gives slightly idealized renderings.) All varieties have a sinuous line inside, running roughly down the long axis, usually connected to the spindle at the sharper end and sometimes terminating in a loop inside. Most of the forms have an additional short line coming out of each end, often with its own termi- nating loop. I have found eight spindle variations in ToP , and in Phases I-III of quires A-D it is the dominant type of mark. Second most common is a hand, usu- ally containing the initials "PD" (four varieties). Another has initials "GM", and in a sixth variety the initials are lacking or illegible. The hands all have a flower or a grape cluster at the fingertips. The third type of mark includes six varieties of pot, two containing the initials RP or RF. One of these may have a handle and might therefore be called a jug. Finally, there is one example of a broad mark (over four centimeters) of uncertain form, but apparently bracketed by two short convex columns. I have called this "posts". In all the copies examined, only one sheet (quire C of B.L. Ashley 1696 ) seemed to lack a mark. The frequencies of the marks in quires A-D are as follows: 63 63. I have omitted quire "a", which, being a half-sheet, will fail to show a mark in about half the copies. However, the marks I did find (with no trend discernible in this small sample) were eight spindles, one hand, and one pot. FIGURE 4. Spindle watermarks in Triumph of Peace. TABLE 44. Distribution of watermarks by phases Phase Spindle Hand Pot Posts No mark I 29 (71%) 9 (22%) 2 (5%) 0 1 (2%) II 22 (92%) 1 (4%) 0 1 (4%) 0 III 18 (90%) 2 (10%) 0 0 0 IV 9 (36%) 12 (48%) 4 (16%) 0 0 The spindles, I believe, are significant for two reasons. First, their frequency drops at Phase IV, with hands coming into the majority and pots making a surge. Although the sample size is small, these shifts could indicate a transition into a different mixture of paper stocks and hence a rather longer pause after Phase III than after I or II. Secondly, of the other books printed by Norton in 1633–34 that I was able to examine, only one contains a spindle: that is the Huntington copy of the seventh quarto of Richard II , dated 1634 . It has two specific versions found in ToP , as well as two ToP hands, along with two marks which I found in Richard II only. The received wisdom about printers' paper stocks is that they bought only what they needed for specific jobs, and this makes economic sense. Indeed, the stock found in ToP Phases I-III is consistent with a single batch of paper assembled by a vendor from the products of two or more makers. The odd post or pot could either be odds slipped into the ream by the vendor or leftovers from a previous lot remaining in Norton's shop. In practice, the end of a job never precisely coincides with the end of the paper supply, and Norton was a busy man, printing about 250 edition-sheets that we know of in 1633 (though that number drops to around 150 the next year). A more sensible response to a continuous need for the middling-quality pot-sized paper found in virtually all of Norton's books of the period would be to periodically estimate the projected demand for incoming work and top off an in-shop supply that all the jobs could draw upon. Thus, we would expect frequently to find the same marks (by which I mean paper from the same specific moulds) in publications printed around the same time. This is the sort of evidence we find in ToP and Richard II , 64 and I pre- dict that if more copies of the latter are examined, they will contain a proportion of spindles to hands comparable to that of Phase IV of ToP. A finding of similar paper stocks would indicate that the two books were printed in quick succession, ToP first, or even with some overlap. The distinctive mixture of marks in the four phases of ToP tightens their temporal bond. It reinforces the evidence that Norton produced the first three impressions in as short a time as he could. It also shows that there is little chance that he paused for long between Phases III and IV. Standing paper, like stand- ing type, is vulnerable to appropriation by more urgent projects. The fact that the paper in Phase IV shows significant overlap with the distinctive paper stock used in the previous printings is consistent with my finding of broken types from Phase III recurring in Phase IV (�9D). Both support a conclusion that Norton did not wait long before embarking on the last impression. I would guess that the four print runs were all over within two months. CONCLUSIONS AND APPLICATIONS I have presented evidence showing that John Norton printed The Triumph of Peace in four impressions, with hiatuses within the second and third of these. Varying amounts of text—but always much less than half of the book—were distributed and reset before each of the later impressions, at least partly to sup- ply other jobs running concurrently. The preliminaries, including the title page, also went through four impressions, but in different quantities from the text quires, so that the first two states of the title may each occur with two possible impressions of the text. Other, smaller disparities in print runs among the text quires produced occasional copies containing quires from adjacent impressions, further complicating the problems of identification. However, in general the four printings of the text come together in a few consistent combinations with little intermixing. The state of quire C is the clearest indicator of which impression a copy belongs to, but fully characterizing exemplars of the first three printings still requires the specification of many variables. About half of the copies of the third and fourth impressions contain type-material from Norton's partner Nicholas Okes and are presumed to have been printed by him. The difficulties that earlier bibliographers had with ToP arose largely from their point of view. Like astronomers of the Ptolemaic paradigm, they put the most familiar element—the title page, in this case—at the center and saw the rest of the system behaving with a bewildering complexity. Moving the main part of the book—the text—to the center and relegating the title page to its own odd but explainable orbit eliminates much of the need to invoke mysterious causes. Even so, the book offers seemingly unlimited surprises—even unto the fifty-fifth copy—and mysteries whose unravelling I will now leave, as did Greg, to those 64. I also noted a mark shared by STC 13584 and 21176, allied if not identical to the posts in the B.L. ToP Ashley 1697 . I was not able to investigate further correspondences among Norton's other non- ToP productions. with more "leisure and opportunity". Those happy investigators might be able to explain the unique variant in St. Catharine's (Cambridge) Z59; the garbling of states in some phases of quires B and C; the weird quire interactions in the Phase IIIb copies; the rationale of enlisting a second printer for help on quire D; and the identity and dynamics of the competing jobs in Norton's shop. Mechani- cal collation (a luxury that I did not allow myself) might uncover tiny differences in the pairs of "identical" reprints that I have hypothesized above. The complexities of ToP may tempt us to put it in a class by itself, 65 but it contains lessons that might point the way to a fresh approach to certain diffi- cult cases. For example, both Greg and STC treat Philip Massinger's The Picture ( 1630 ) as one edition with a confusing array of variants. 66 A brief comparison of copies, with attention to the skeletons, reveals a similar situation to that of ToP: there were at least two impressions, though in this case the copies contain sheets drawn indiscriminately from both. Perhaps not coincidentally, the printer was again John Norton , and one immediately recognizes the characteristic slovenli- ness that he inflicted on his lower-end work. Looking at The Picture in this light may ease the work of the next editor, but it also at least doubles our estimate of the play's sales during the author's lifetime. I cannot believe that The Triumph of Peace and The Picture form the tip of a particularly large iceberg, but they do underline the need to pay close attention to skeletons, especially when the headlines contain nothing more than page numbers. We are still exploring the range of ingenious—if not devious—shifts that early modern printers could use to make their lives easier. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study had its origin in a cataloguing impasse at the Huntington Library, to which I had been posted by the American office of the recently renamed En- glish Short-Title Catalogue under the inspired directorship of Henry Snyder . It is to Dr. Snyder and the Huntington that I owe the initial opportunity to be baffled by ToP . Randall McLeod spent entirely too much of his busy retirement in re- peated reading and marking up of the manuscript, and Joseph Gwara also made invaluable suggestions. The project could not have been completed without the aid of staff at the libraries holding copies of the book.

Oh!'", Studies in Bibliography , 12 [ 1959 ], 204–213) turns up many similar practices. That case has additional complications of variant formats and paper stocks, but also the rare boon of surviving printer's records. 66. Greg, Bibliography , 436; STC 17640, 17640.5, and addendum.

APPENDIX 1 KEY TO VARIANTS The leftmost numbers indicate major break-points in the production cycle. Suc- cessive indentions show increasingly minor variants. The variants are identified by combining the sigla at the successive indentions. For example: on page a2v, variant 1b1 has a comma after "Honourers" in the dedication's closing; the clos- est distance between "S" in "IAMES" and "S" in "SHIRLEY" is 3 mm; and there is a rule at the bottom.

APPENDIX 3 Master Table of Printing Variants The table on the following pages appears in color on the website of the Biblio- graphical Society of the University of Virginia : http//www.bsuva.org. APPENDIX 3: Master Table of Printing Variants THE MANUSCRIPTS OF SIR HENRY MAINWARING'S SEA-MANS DICTIONARY by AMY BOWLES IN the early 1620 s, the naval commander and newly appointed Lieutenant of DoverCastle Sir Henry Mainwaring (or Manwayring, 1586/7–1653 ) compiled a detailed dictionary of nautical terms titled A Brief Abstract, Exposition and Demonstra- tion of all Parts &amp; Thingsbelonging to a Ship, and the Practique of Nauigation. He presented several manuscript copies to his personal patrons and to high-ranking naval officials; the dictionary only found its way into print in 1644 , as The Sea-mans Dictionary: or, an Exposition and Demonstration of all the Parts and Things belonging to a Shippe ( London , G. M. for John Bellamy ). In his preface, Mainwaring expressed his concern that 'very few Gentlemen (though they be called Sea-men) doe fully and wholy understand what belongs to their Profession: having onely some Scrambling Termes &amp; Names belonging to some parts of a Ship' 1 The rise in 'gentleman commanders' - men appointed to naval positions due to their influence at court rather than any practi- cal experience of seamanship - had long been an irritation to professional seamen 2 The Sea-mans Dictionary provided novices with definitions for around six hundred naval words and phrases, listed alphabetically, with an index of terms. The scribe employed by Mainwaring to copy his dictionary was Ralph (or Raph) Crane (fl. 1589–1632 ) 3 Eight surviving manuscripts of the Parts andThings belonging to a Ship , including five produced as presentation copies, were transcribed by Crane 4 A further twelve copies are extant, attesting to the dictionary's wide 1.

Lambeth Palace MS 91; Lambeth Palace Sion College MS L.40.2/E48; National Maritime Museum Caird Library MS LEC/9; Devonshire Collection, Chatsworth House; Sutherland Collection, Mertoun House, Roxburghshire; University of Illinois MS 0211; copy dedicated to Edward , Baron Zouche , LordWarden of the Cinque Ports, sold at Sotheby's, 3 December 2015 (Lot 534) current location unknown, microfilm in the British Library (MS RP 5197); copy dedicated to the Marquess of Buckingham, Lord High Admiral, sold at Christie's, 5 December 1974 (Lot 302), current location unknown. manuscript circulation during the twenty years before its print publication 5. The survival of a considerable number of manuscript copies, many of which have been reproduced or paraphrased from others, suggests that the dictionary was a popular work and that its exposition ofnaval terms was of widespread value. This article will examine these twenty surviving manuscripts, indicatetheir relationships, and comment on the scribal circulation of the dictionary. I Mainwaring dedicated and presented manuscripts to at least five people: his employer, Edward , Baron Zouche , Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports (manu- script sold at Sotheby's, 2015, current location unknown); to the Lord High Admiral, the Marquess of Buckingham (manuscript sold at Christie's, 1974 , cur- rent location unknown, MS 9 in the Navy Records Society edition); to the Sec- retary of State, Sir Robert Naunton (Lambeth Palace Sion College MS L.40.2/ E48); to the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Abbot (Lambeth Palace MS 91, MS 6 in the Navy Records Society edition); and to Sir John Egerton , first Earl of Bridgewater (Sutherland Collection, Mertoun House, Roxburghshire). These copies, all transcribed by Crane, share the same type of watermark, have similar luxury presentation bindings with silk ties, and all but one have the same title- page border with illustrations of navigational instruments 6 Crane also made three further copies, which were not explicitly produced on Mainwaring's be- half. One of these, National Maritime Museum CairdLibrary MS LEC/9 (MS 8 in the Navy Records Society edition), which is likely to have belonged to Henry Percy , ninth Earl of Northumberland, conforms to the uniform style of Mainwaring's presentation manuscripts, with the same fleur-de-lis watermark and lavish title-pageborder 7 By contrast, the other two undedicated Crane copies - one now in the Devonshire Collection at Chatsworth House, prob- ably originally owned by Sir William Cavendish , second Earl of Devonshire ( 1590–1628 ), and one now held by the University of Illinois andonce owned by the diplomat William Trumbull ( 1576/80–1635 ) - containa different, pillar 5. Mainwaring's 1921 Navy Records Society editors listed eleven manuscripts of the dictionary in total. Nine additional manuscripts are considered here: BL Add. MS 76660; National Library of Wales Herbert of Cherbury MS E4/2; National Archives SP 16/127; National Maritime Museum Caird Library MSS SMP/3 and AND/25; Lambeth Palace Sion College MS L.40.2/E48; Devonshire Collection, Chatsworth House; Sutherland Collection, Mertoun House, Roxburghshire. The Navy Records Society editors were not aware of the manuscript which is now University of Illinois MS 0211, but which has since been described by T. H. Howard-Hill and H. R. Woudhuysen; see Howard-Hill , Ralph Crane , pp. 174–175, and Woudhuysen , Circulation of Manuscripts , pp. 194–195. 6. The watermark is Heawood 1721–1721a (Schieland 1609 ; Schieland 1614 ). Egerton's copy contains a plainer style of title page. The manuscripts given to Naunton and Abbot have identical bindings, suggesting that they were bound before being presented. 7. This manuscript's binding style differs from that of the presentation copies. It has been bound by the 'Squirrel Binder', using the same style of central tool as the Folger Shakespeare Library's copy of STC 7758.3. For this binder see H. M. Nixon , 'English Bookbindings 62: A London Binding by the Squirrel Binder, c. 1620 ', The Book Collector , 19 (Spring 1970 ): 66, and Mirjam Foot , 'Lord Herbert and the Squirrel Binder' , in The Henry Davis Gift , vol. 1 (London: British Library, 1978 ): 50–58. watermark, and a variant style of title-page decoration which is more charac- teristic of Crane. The title pages of both manuscripts explicitly identify Crane as the scribe 8. Five manuscripts of the dictionary survive which are not associated with Mainwaring or Crane's initial circulation of the text, but which retain the dic- tionary's original title. BL Sloane MS 207 (MS 2 in the Navy Records Soci- ety edition) is a transcription of the copy presented to Zouche, and reproduces Mainwaring's dedication to him 9 This manuscript was owned by Henry Mervyn ( 1583–1646 ), Admiral of the Narrow Seas. BL Harley MS 6268 (MS 4 in the Navy Records Society edition) is titled An Abstract and exposition of all things per- taininge to the practique of Navigation , bears Sir Robert Harley's ( 1579–1656 ) arms, and was written by at least three scribes. Another undated copy of the dictionary, in a single hand, survives in the State Papers (MS 5 inthe Navy Records Soci- ety edition), while a further copy in at least two hands is now a loose bundle of folios held in the National Library of Wales. 10 Owned by Edward Herbert ,first Baron Herbert of Cherbury, it may have formed part of his collection of material associated with the Duke of Buckingham's 1627 siege of Rhé. 11 Lastly, BL Add. MS 48165 (Yelverton MS 177, MS 11 in the Navy Records Society edition) is the first of two manuscripts of the dictionary that once belonged to Henry Yelverton ( 1566–1630 ). Though it shares a binding style and watermark with the other Yelverton manuscript, Add. MS 48157 (Yelverton MS 169, MS 10 in the Navy Records Society edition), the copies are written in different hands. 12 A separate group of manuscripts gives the dictionary a different title. Lambeth Palace MS 268 (MS 7 in the Navy Records Society edition) is headed Nomenclator Navalis or an exact Collecion and exposition of all words and tearmes of Arte belonginge to the Partes, quallities, Condicions, proportions, Rigging, ffittinge, manageinge, and saileinge of Shipps with other Necessaries to be knowne in the Practique of Navigation; Alsoe inclu- deinge soe much of the Arte of Gunnery as Concernes the use of Ordenance at Sea. It is in a single professional hand and contains neither a dedication nor a title page. This manuscript belonged to George Carew ( 1555–1629 ), earl of Totnes, whose arms it sports, and survives in its original binding. Four more copies also use the Latinate title. BL Add. MS 21571 (MS 3 in the Navy Records Society edition) is elaborately written in a distinctive rounded hand, in black, red, and gold ink. It is the only copy produced in a pocket-friendly octavo format, and retains significantwater dam- age, possibly acquired during its direct consultation at sea. One of the few dated versions, its index concludes with a paraph containing a note of the year, 1625 . It has no dedication, but its binding is stamped with the Earl of Denbigh's arms. BL Harley MS 2301 (MS 1 in the Navy Records Society edition) is in the hands of 8. The watermark, two pillarswith grapes, is not in Heawood or Briquet. It is similar to Gravell No. FOL 0416 ( 1620 ). The title-page decoration of these manuscripts is characterized by double rulings and large, space-filling, curlicues.Crane employs this style of decoration very often, for example on the title pages o f Bodleian MS Rawl. D. 301, BL Lansdowne MS 690, and National Library of Wales Brogyntyn MS 2/42. 9. See Woudhuysen , Circulation of Manuscripts , p. 194, note 31. 10.

The watermark is Heawood 2096 (Leiden, 1620 ). two scribes, one of whom also appears to have copied Add. MS 21571. They swap stints between the dictionaryentries for J and K, halfway through L, and during P, but the watermark remains the same throughout the manuscript. The second Yelverton manuscript, BL Add MS 48157, is written in a single, unique hand, contains no dedication, is dated 3 September 1633 , and retains its contemporary vellum binding and blue silk ties. The latest of the Nomenclator Navalis versions, BL Add. MS 76660 is an 1820 s copy in a single hand. Though its paper, script, and dedication to William Fielding , Earl of Denbigh ( 1796–1865 ) from an unknown 'HN' are all of the nineteenth century, it is interesting that the manuscript is bound in a seventeenth-century style, with panelled calf and gold tooling. Finally, two more manuscripts of the dictionary, now both in the Caird Li brary of the National Maritime Museum, contain significantly altered versions of the dictionary. An undated copy written in two hands,MS SMP/3 reproduces selected rearranged entries, while a greatly abbreviated 4-page version of the dictionary survives as part of MS AND/25. The index of MS SMP/3 is laid out in the same style as in Crane's manuscripts, with central headings and ruled-off sections. The scribes responsible for the copy did not attempt to reproduce one another's handwriting; rather, one scribe repeatedly identifies his own dictionary entries with a trefoil paraph. MS AND/25 is bound with two unattributed hand- coloured prints of ships, sections of which have been labelled alphabetically. The labels correspond to the brief index of the abbreviated dictionary, suggesting that the roughly copied manuscript was once used for the personal study of ships' terms and parts, rather than for presentation or a gift. 13 II By recovering these witnesses of the Parts and Things belonging to a Ship and placing them alongside one another, their textual and material affinities emerge. Some scribal similaritieshighlight links between otherwise diverse copies: the copyist of BL Add. MS 21571 took care to produce a highly decorative portable copy, but at another time wrote more workmanlike portions of BL Harley MS 2301, a larger, plainer version, as one of a group of hands. The manicules pres- ent in BL Harley MS 6268 and BL Sloane MS 207 appear in identical locations. The textual content of these two manuscripts is also very similar, suggesting that despite their different owners, scribes, and bindings one was produced using the other, or both were copied from the same source. Figure 1 indicates the textual relationships among the surviving manuscripts. Dashed lines denote a slight, but noteworthy, degree of influence or similarity 13. At least three further copies of the dictionary were once in existence. William Freke ( 1605–1656 ), Robert Devereux ( 1591–1646 ), and Erasmus Norwich ( 1668–1720 ) all owned manuscripts of the work: For Freke, who paid 1 s.10d. for the book's 'binding up (in leather)', see G. W. Prothero , 'An English Account Book', English Historical Review , 7, no. 25 ( 1892 ): 88–102 (p. 97) and H. V F. Somerset , 'An Account Book of an Oxford Undergraduate in the years 1619–1622 ', Oxoniensia , 22 ( 1957 ): 85–92. I am grateful to H. R. Woudhuysen for this reference. For Devereux see Vernon F. Snow , 'An Inventory of the Lord General's Library, 1646 ', The Library , 5th ser., 21 ( 1966 ): 115–123 (p. 120); for Norwich see Manwaringand Per- rin, eds., Life and Works , 1: 82. FIGURE I. Textual relationships among the surviving manuscripts of Mainwaring's Parts and Things Belonging to a Ship. between witnesses that appear otherwise unrelated. This data has been gathered through a textual comparisonof the witnesses, in combination with a consid- eration of material similarities and factors such as dating and provenance. All the manuscripts' dictionary entries were collated, including their order. 14 The comparison does not include the lost copy dedicated to Buckingham,but it does include the copy dedicated to Zouche, using the microfilm reproduction in the British Library. 15 It also includes the 1644 printed edition, which follows a similar textual pattern to Crane's manuscripts. The results provide an account of the transmission and alteration of the Parts and Things belonging to a Ship fol- lowingits initial presentation, based on the textual and material nature of its surviving witnesses. Two textual traditions emerge: the early Parts and Things belonging to a Ship text (labelled in roman type), and the modified Nomenclator Navalis text (labelled in italics). The Parts and Things belonging to a Ship tradition derives from Crane's early cluster of similar copies which share textual characteristics common to all other copies, suggesting that at least some of these were repeatedly recopied texts. These manuscripts are the Sutherland Collectioncopy, National Maritime Museum Caird Library MS LEC/9, the Devonshire Collection copy, National Library of Wales Herbert of Cherbury MS E4/2, and SP 16/127. The three Crane copies (the Sutherland Collection copy, Caird MS LEC/9, and the De vonshire Collection copy) are textually identical, except that Caird MS LEC/9 lacks the entry 'wast' ('betweene the maine-mast and the fore-castle'), and the Devonshire collection copy enters 'harpings' ('the breadth of [the ship] at the bowe') in a different location. Similarly, SP 16/127 introduces the new entry 'girdling' ('to double plancke [...]aboue the water lyne'), and National Library of Wales Herbert of Cherbury MS E4/2 relocates 'the runner' ('a roape which [...] doth belong to the Garnet'). Because of these variations, it cannot be assumed that these copies were directly copied from one another, but it is clear that they formed, or are related to copies that formed, an early group of witnesses. None of these manuscripts containsa date, but several can be estimated: Herbert of Cherbury's interest in Buckingham's naval expeditions appears to have begun in the late 1620 s and early 1630 s, and the State Papers copy isdocketed as enter- ing the Office in 1628 . Caird MS LEC/9 in particular contains a text found in a number of other copies. 14. Although the abbreviated version found in Caird MS AND/25 was collated with the other manuscripts, its abridged nature means that its textual origins are still uncertain. It could have feasibly been copied fromnine of the other manuscripts considered (any of the Caird MS LEC/9 group; BL Add. MS 48165; University of Illinois MS 0211; Lambeth Palace MS 91; Lambeth Palace Sion College MS L.40.2/E48; BL Harley MS 2301). Similarly, the Caird Li- brary copy MS SMP/3 contains so few entries, and in such an exceptional order, that its textual relations could not be identified beyond the fact that it derived from a Parts and Things belonging to a Ship version rather than a Nomenclator Navalis copy. Both manuscripts have therefore not been included in the diagram. 15. Manwaring and Perrin's edition notes several entries which were omitted in the Buck- ingham copy (which was then available to them). It is interesting that the notes suggest that this copy was distinctly different to the Crane versions now extant. See Life and Works , 2: 83–260. Crane's Lambeth Palace MS 91 (MS 6 in the Navy Records Society edition) and Lambeth Palace Sion College MS L.40.2/E48 share all the dictionary en tries found in Caird MS LEC/9, of which four have been relocated (sprit-sail- top-mast; shore; halliards; quarter-deck). It is probable that Crane produced Lambeth Palace MS 91 and Lambeth Palace Sion College MS L.40.2/E48 to- gether. Although the manuscripts are not dated, Robert Naunton , described in the Lambeth Palace Sion College MS L.40.2/E48 dedication as 'one of his Majesties most honorable priuy Coun- sell', was suspended from the Privy Council from January 1621 until January 1625 , so the manuscript's production must have pre-dated his disgrace or post-dated his return. 16 Caird MS LEC/9 is also very similar to the transcription of Mainwaring's dedicated copy to Zouche , BL Sloane MS 207. BL Sloane MS 207 shares all of Caird MS LEC/9's entries, but relocates eight of them ('shore'; 'former'; 'further'; 'furthering lines'; 'hale or over-hale'; 'sheer hookes'; 'taught'; 'chase'). Most similar to the lost Zouche copy and BL Sloane MS 207, however, is BL Harley MS 6268. Only one entry becomes displaced during the copying of BL Harley MS 6268 ('passarado' - 'any roape where with we hale-downe the sheate-blocks'), and the presence of shared manicules indicates that BL Harley MS 6268 could feasibly have been copied directly from the lost Zouche copy or from BL Sloane MS 207. Again undated, this chain of manuscripts is likely to have been produced in the late 1620 s. The early presentation manuscripts are equally similar to BL Add. MS 48165 as they are to to BL Sloane MS 207, with BL Add. MS 48165 also relocating eight entries ('standing ropes'; 'holesome'; 'way of the ship'; 'draught'; 'dregg'; 'drift- sail'; 'keenke'; 'sprit-sail-top-mast'). Lastly, also resembling Caird MS LEC/9, the 1644 printed Seamans Dictionary moves four of Caird MS LEC /9's dictionary entries ('cocks'; 'sheere-hookes'; 'fish'; 'sheevers'), divides 'calm and be-calming' into two entries, and omits 'boate' (used 'to carry-forth and waigh the sheate- anchor'). The printed text continued to provide a basis for the later editions of 1666 , 1667 , and 1670 . 17 That a copy so like the early dedicated manuscripts was available in 1644 is a testamentto the persistence of this version of the Parts and Things belonging to a Ship , which appears to have generated copies for over twenty years, including more than half of the surviving manuscripts of the work. Within the Parts and Things belonging to a Ship title tradition, variations be- tween witnesses primarily arose from the relocation of entries, rather than from the introduction of new definitions or the omission of previous ones. By contrast, textual variations in the Nomenclator Navalis manuscripts are characterised by the adaptation of text through the addition or exclusion of content, rather than its re- ordering or retitling. The Nomenclator Navalis tradition emerged when a Parts and Things belonging to a Ship text, which was similar to Caird MS LEC /9, was copied with a new title and a number of new entries. BL Harley MS 2301 is an early version of the resulting manuscript tradition, recognisable by the changed title, and a greater variation of entries. BL Harley MS 2301 contains four terms absent from the Parts and Things belonging to a Ship group ('dredge'; 'cunting'; 'garland'; 16. Lambeth Palace Sion College MS L.40.2/E48, fol. 3 r. 17. See Manwaring and Perrin, eds., Life and Works , 2: 75–77. 'running-rope'), omits Caird MS LEC/g's 'sillender' (the 'hollow concaueof a peece of ordnans'), relocates'breaming' ('when a boate [...] is brought a-ground to be trimed'), and separates 'buoy' ('a peece of wood [...] which floates right over the anchor') from 'buoyant' ('when any thing is apt to ffloate'). Although BL Harley MS 2301 is undated, further Nomenclator Navalis copies derived from this version were produced at relatively early dates, suggesting an immediate contemporary desire to augment or alter the dictionary for further use. 18 The greatest number of seventeenth-century additions to the text occurred between the Caird MS LEC/g group and BL Harley MS 2301, but small varia- tions also arose between other Nomenclator Navalis copies. Lambeth Palace MS 268 alters the text of BL Harley MS 2301 by exchanging 'hale or overhale' ('pull- ing a roape')for 'hale or hailing' ('calling to [a ship]'), while BL Add. MS 48157 adheres to BL Harley MS 2301's text, only omitting 'floane' ('when any of the sheates are not haled-home') fromthe list of terms. This unique omission, as well as BL Add. MS 48157's 1633 dating, suggests that it was produced separately, and at a later time than the chain of Nomenclator Navalis texts represented by the manuscripts BL Harley MS 2301, Lambeth Palace MS 268 and BL Add. MS 21571, a manuscript which contains all the alterations of BL Harley MS 2301 and Lambeth Palace MS 268, but also adds the term 'bay' ('when two pointes or head lands lie soe farr of [...] that there ys made [...] a hollownesse'). The final manuscript in this chain of texts is the nineteenth-century copy BL Add MS 76660. This version embodies all the alterations of BL Harley MS 2301, Lambeth Palace MS 268 and BL Add. MS 21571, but omits many entries ('wast'; 'carvel work'; 'case'; 'caskets'; 'crow trees'; 'lee'; 'skegge'; 'stern sheets'; 'the strap'; 'wash a ship') and shortens 'entring ropes' ('the roapes which hang by the side of the ship') to 'entring'. It is notable that this final Nomenclator Navalis copy in the chain, despite being produced around two centuries later, omits obsolete terms, but does not noticeably update or contribute to the remaininginformation. One remaining manuscript occupies an unusual position with respect to this model of transmission. Crane's 1626 undedicated manuscript University of Il- linois MS 0211 resembles an adapted version of BL Add. MS48165, sharing the earlier manuscript's unique locations of 'keenke' ('a litle turne [...] in a cabell') and 'sprit-sail-top-mast' ('vide top-mast') and adding the new entry 'jocant' ('vide buoyant'). However, its first 38 folios, constituting the majority of A to C, do not follow BL Add. MS 48165, and instead resemble BL Harley MS 2301, Lambeth Palace MS 268 and BL Add. MS 21571 of the Nomenclator Navalis tradition. III Several conclusions can be drawn from the model of transmission offered here. Most of the surviving manuscripts were produced during the 1620 s and early 1630 s. The appearance of these copies was rapid; all but one of the con- temporary Nomenclator Navalis manuscripts were produced within two years of 18. . George Carew , the owner of Lambeth Palace MS 268, died in 1629 ; BL Add. MS 21571 is dated 1625 (fol. gr). Mainwaring's first presentation copies. The key versions of the text are found in two manuscripts: CairdMS LEC/9 and BL Harley MS 2301. Caird MS LEC/9 represents the text of an early, similar cluster of manuscripts which became a source for twelve further manuscripts and the 1644 printed text. The text found in one of these manuscripts, BL Harley MS 2301 went on to influence the entire Nomenclator Navalis tradition. There are several points at which surviving manu- scripts could feasibly have been copied from one another: BL Harley MS 6268 copies the manicule locations of BL Sloane MS 207, while Crane's Lambeth Pal- ace MS 91 and Lambeth Palace Sion College MS L.40.2/E48 are indistinguish- able, both textually and in their presentation. BL Sloane MS 207 was copied from the manuscript of the text given to Zouche,since it retains the presentation copy's dedicatory address. University of Illinois MS 0211 resembles both the BL Harley MS 2301 Nomenclator Navalis tradition and the BL Add. MS 48165 Parts and Things belonging to a Ship text, while the Lambeth Palace Sion College MS L.40.2/E48-Lambeth Palace MS 91 and BL Sloane MS 207- BL Harley MS 6268 pairs share an otherwise unique relocation of 'shore'. Despite their variant producers, owners, and physical properties, the texts contained in the extant manuscripts are strikingly interlinked, often drawing upon one or more other copies of the dictionary. Most notably, the reproduction of this text almost always involved the re- location of dictionary entries and often included the addition or omission of content. Although the popularity of the dictionary testifies to the need for a book explaining nautical terms to 'gentlemen commanders', its ownership amongst already experienced naval figures indicates that it also represented the combined knowledge of the naval and military figures among whom it circulated, including Mervyn, Carew, Denbigh, and Northumberland. The manuscript circulation of the text helped to produce a living collection of nautical definitions which re- flected and informed current usage.

Lemley IN his 2002 book An Annotated Census of Copernicus' DE REVOLUTIONIBUS (Nuremberg, 1543 and Basel, 1566 ) , Owen Gingerich concludes that the prov- enance of the University of Virginia's copy-the second edition, printed in Ba- sel in 1566 -is indeterminate. Gingerich suggests that the volume "might be a replacement" for the original copy ordered by Thomas Jefferson , presumed lost in a fire that destroyed much of the university's library in the Rotunda on October 27, 1895 (351). In a subsequent account, The Book Nobody Read: Chasing the Revolutions of Nicolaus Copernicus (2004), Gingerich revisits the provenance of the Virginia Copernicus and reaches a similar verdict: "Because many of the volumes of the library were destroyed by fire in 1895 , it is now impossible to knowwhether the copy is the original one or a replacement" (247). My ongo- ing investigation into historical shelf marks and original bindings extant in the University of Virginia library reveals that the recovery of theprovenance of the Virginia Copernicus is far from impossible; in fact, Gingerich's Census records some of the evidence useful in establishing its Jeffersonian origin. Jefferson's manuscript desiderata for the university library confirm that a copy of Copernicus's De Revolutionibus was on order in 1825 . 1 This list also reveals that Jefferson did not specify an edition of the work, leaving the date and place of publication blank. We know, however, that a copy of the second edition of De Revolutionibus was added to the collection between 1825 and 1827 , because it appears in the earliest printed catalogue of the library ( 1828 ) 2 Presumably, this is the same copy recorded in a later manuscript catalogue, begun in 1857 and in use until about 1905 3 These three early lists and catalogues-Jefferson's of 1825 , the printed catalogue of 1828 , and the manuscript catalogue of circa 1857 —at- test to the presence of a copy of Copernicus's De Revolutionibus in the university library from its founding; the question is, was it the same copy held currently in the University of Virginia's Special Collections Library? 1.

Curtis reveals that many of the first books shipped to the university were uniformly bound and that some of these original bindings retain the shelf marks usedin the University of Virginia's Rotunda library before the fire. 4 Unfortunately, the Virginia Copernicus was rebound sometime after Gingerich described it in his census, and any physical evidence unique to the binding has been lost. 5 Demonstrating the importance ofrecording bibliographi- cal evidence in detail, however, Gingerich's description allows us to reconstruct the salient characteristics of this lost binding: "Half calf with yellow-brown paper, boards loose, red gold-stamped label, red edges." 6 This is a style of binding that appears with some regularity on volumes with a clear Jeffersonian and Rotunda library provenance. Four clues illuminate the provenance of the Virginia Copernicus and dem- onstrate that it is the same copy ordered by Thomas Jefferson in 1825 . These are best enumerated, as follows. Astronomy books were removed from the university library by order of the university's Board of Visitors in June 1885 and shelved in the Leander McCor- mick Observatory. 7 Unfortunately, the "receipt" of transfer cited in the Board of Visitors' minutes does not survive. However, the observatory's director, Or- mond Stone, reported to the board in the following year, "in accordance with a resolution passed by you, 165 books and pamphlets have been transferred to the observatory from the general library of the university. Many of the additions thus made are exceedingly valuable." 8 Evidently during the transfer of astronomy books to the observatory, shelf marks were added to the free front endpapers of transferred books. The Virginia Copernicus bears the shelf mark "A787" on the recto of its free front endpaper in the upper right-hand corner-a point Gingerich assiduously records. The prefix "A" presumably identifies books shelved in the "Astronomy" library in the observatory. This type of shelf mark does not match the series marking books shelved in the general collection. In an extensive review of original astronomical 4. Neal D. Curtis and Samuel V.

The Virginia Copernicus was rebound in uniform leather in 2002 at a conservation lab unaffiliated with the University of Virginia. Arepresentative of the company responsible for the rebinding informed me by e-mail that records of conservation treatments are recycled every ten years. The company therefore does not retain a record-photographic or otherwise-of the Virginia Copernicus's original binding. 6. Annotated Census , 351. 7.

For example, the university's copy of Pierre Gassendi's Institutio Astronomica ( 1680 ), also listed in Jefferson's 1825 desiderata, bears the shelf mark "A777" beside an apparently contemporary inscription (in the same hand?) on the free front endpaper, "Leander McCormick Observatory" (QB41 .G2 1680 ). The university's three volumes of Flamsteed's Historiae Coelestis Britannicae (1725) bear the shelf marks "a799-a801" in the same place (QB42 .F5 1725). No non- astronomical books with an early or Jeffersonian provenance were found to con- tain shelf marks from this series, prefaced "A". A small marginal symbol and note in the 1857 manuscript catalog indicates that the Virginia Copernicus was in fact "saved from the fire." 9 Another marginal note next to this symbol observes that the Virginia Copernicus was shelved in the observatory at the time, corroborating the accounts of its removal found in the Board of Visitor's minutes for 1885 and 1886 . The red-painted edges of the Virginia Copernicus and staining from its now-absent leather turn-in corners match those in many volumes with a clear Jeffersonian or pre-fire provenance, particularly those bound uniformly in the style Gingerich describes. Although most of the university's original bindings in this style have decayed considerably, intact examples are found on the univer- sity's copies of Gassendi's Institutio Astronomica (cited above), Alciphron's Rhetoris Epistolae (PA3862 .A3 1798), Adelung's Mithridates (P201 .A3 1806 v. 1–5), and Xenophon's Opera (PA4494 .A2 1801 , v. 1–4)-all are bound in a style matching Gingerich's description: half calf with yellow-brown paper, red gold- label, red edges. Intriguingly, this style of binding seems unique to titles with a German provenance (either imprint or sale). Pairing the surviving archival and shelf mark evidence detailed here with Gingerich's description of the Virginia Copernicus's original binding provides near proof of its Jeffersonian origin. Besides establishing the provenance of one of the University of Virginia's bibliographic treasures, I hope to have demonstrated the potential in pursuing provenance research both in and around books. While archives, bibliographies, and institutional records—that is, peripheral sources—are recognized tools in determining the individual pasts of books, the books themselves offer physical evidence to which bibliographers are uniquely attuned. It follows, then, that this evidence must be retained and protected, even (and perhaps especially) when deemed insignificant. As shown here, historical bindings convey clues that might only become legible in the future and after renewed scrutiny. In this, Owen Gingerich's Census provides a helpful model: details, however inscrutable or 9.

A note on the first page of the second volume explains that marginal marks were added to identify books saved, replaced, or lost in the fire, with distinctive sigla indicating these respectively. The Virginia Copernicus is recorded in the first volume of the catalog and is marked with a red slash or checkmark, indicating it survived the fire. Above this mark , the word "observatory" was added in pencil. seemingly inconsequential, should be fully described and noted. My addendum to Gingerich meanwhile reaffirms theprotracted and sometimes inadvertently collaborative aspect of any large-scale bibliographical project. Gingerich's monu- mental Census , as with any comparably ambitious survey, offers traces to follow and claims to confirm. JOYCE'S ULYSSES LIBRARY by TRISTAN POWER THERE is a great amount of evidence for the books read by Joyce from 1914 to 1922 while he was writing Ulysses , but it has not been given the full attention that it deserves. 1 Six hundred items survive in the Nelly Joyce collec- tion, almost all of which are genuine works belonging to Joyce from his Trieste library. 2 Besides these, ninety further titles have been obtained from the external evidence of Joyce's shelf inventory and bookstore bills duringthis period, but esti- mates of the library suggest that it contained at least another five hundred books, which have left few if any documentary traces that are external to the novel itself. 3 Book lists in his Ulysses notebooks have also thrown light on his reading, particularly for his years in Zurich, when he read books from the public library, 4 as well as for the composition of the work's final episodes in Paris. However, the current transcriptions of all this evidence remain either incomplete or filled with errors. By emending these lists with different conjectures that solvea number of textual cruxes, several new works not previously known to have influenced Joyce may be discovered. This essay corrects mistaken readings of the surviving docu- ments related to Joyce's library during the composition of Ulysses. I use the word "library" in thesame wider sense as Ellmann, who included not only books that 1. Most of the known library is gathered by Richard Ellmann, "Joyce's Library in 1920 ," in The Consciousness of Joyce ( New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1977 ), 97–134, but merely through the spring of 1920 up to Joyce's move to Paris, when he had only reached as far as the very early draft stage of the "Circe" episode. Other discussions include Richard Brown, "Addenda and Corrigenda to Ellmann's The Consciousness of Joyce," James Joyce Quarterly 17 ( 1980 ), 313–317 and Michael Patrick Gillespie, "A Critique of Ellmann's List of Joyce's Trieste Library," James Joyce Quarterly 19 ( 1981 ), 27–36.

Joyce owned on his shelves, but also any works for which there is evidence of "his reading or having read" at that time. 5 The record of his library is important to interpretations of the novel, establishing his knowledge of particular authors' works and providing support for arguments in favor of allusions or sources for the book. As I will show, many of the errors were introduced by transcribers, while other titles have simply been misidentified. I Let us begin with the bill dated 23 May 1914 from the Libreria F. H. Schimpff in Trieste, recording fifty crownsowed for twenty books that had been purchased by Joyce over the previous seven months. 6 Three of the titles on this bill are inaccurately transcribed by Ellmann, who was the first to deal with this document: 7 Berlitz, I Sauer, Englische Grammatik Schlüssel, Englische Grammatik Based on inspection of the bill itself (fig. 1), the first entry is more precisely "Berlitz, I livre," making itidentifiable with M. D. Berlitz's Premier livre pour l'enseignement des langues modernes . 8 It was therefore a French textbook, and may even have been for Joyce himself, who knew the language but was continuing to study it at this time. 9 The initial parts of Ellmann's other two entries are misguided. These are not authors' names at all: the first is the title of the series, "Methode Gaspey- Otto-Sauer," in which the language book Englische Konversations-Grammatik was published; 10 while the word Schlüssel means "Keys" in German, and Ellmann has evidently also missed the abbreviation "z." for the preposition "zur." As the bill shows, the actual line is "Schlussel z — — [i.e., Engl. Grammatik]"; in 5. Ellmann, "Joyce's Library in 1920 ," p. 97. On this subject, see Dirk Van Hulle, "Digi- tal Library History: The Virtual Bookcases of James Joyce and Samuel Beckett ," Quaerendo 46 ( 2016 ), 192–204. 6. F. H. Schimpff, "Bill Sent to James Joyce, " James Joyce Collection, #4609, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library, Series II, Box 3, Folder 26, MS 1401. This bill did not appear in the The James Joyce Archive (hereafter JJA), ed. Michael Groden et al., 63 vols. (New York, 1977–1979 ), but is reproduced here as figure 1. It is suggested by Gillespie, "A Critique of Ellmann's List," p. 33 that since the bill was not fully paid, Joyce may not have owned all of these books. However, it is more likely that he bought them all on credit, as he usually did, which often led to threats of being sued; see Gordon Bowker, James Joyce: A Biography (London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2011 ), 159, 173–174, 186, 207. 7.

It emerges finally as the answer book to the previous title on the list, 11 which stands to reason, since both texts were purchased onthe same day. Joyce no doubt purchased both books to teach English to his Triestine students, some of whom were German. II On the fifth page of Joyce's 1917 subject notebook, we find a list of authors and titles from English literature that has not been completely transcribed. 12 Once fully understood, the list is discovered to be a chronologically backwards selection (from the nineteenth to the fourteenth century) of authors and titles from Edmund Gosse's A Short History of Modern English Literature . 13 This work also proved useful for the linguistic evolution of the "Oxen of the Sun" episode, as is clear from a letter by Joyce on that episode, in which he refers to "a choppy Latin-gossipy bit, style of Burton-Browne." 14 He gets this verdict from Gosse, who likens Thomas Browne to Robert Burton, referring to the former's "abrupt transitions," and claiming that there is "muchmore that is his own, in relation to parts adapted from the ancients, than in Burton." 15 Let us examine Joyce's list of notes from this book exactly as it is written: Peacock (Thomas Love): Headlong Hall , Nightmare Abbey Galt (John) : Annals of the Parish Shelley (Mrs): Frankenstein Ferrier (Miss): Marriage Brunton (Mary) : Selfcontrol, Discipline Hallam (Henry) : View of Middle Ages Crabbe (Geo): Borough (Thos) : Fudge Family in Paris Burney (Frances): Evelina, Cecilia Edgeworth (Maria): Castle Rackrent Burke : Letter to a Noble Lord Sterne: Tristram Shandy 11. Thomas Gaspey, Englische Konversations-Grammatik zum Schul- und Privatunterricht: Schlüs- sel, 2nd ed., ed. H. Runge (Heidelberg: J. Groos, 1897 ). The most recent edition of this book was the fourth edition, which had been published in 1906 . 12. James Joyce, "II.i.1. Notebook," Joyce Papers 2002 , Department of Manuscripts, National Library of Ireland, MS 36,639/3, p. 5. This book list was mostly transcribed by Wim Van Mierlo, "The Subject Notebook: A Nexus in the Composition History of Ulysses —A Pre- liminary Analysis," Genetic Joyce Studies 7 ( 2007 ), 9; Danis Rose (ed.), James Joyce : The Dublin Ulysses Papers, 6 vols., rev. ed. (East Lansing: House of Breathings, 2012 ), 3: 23–26. As Rose demonstrates (3: 25), Van Mierlo's "Up Tails All" for line 37 should instead be "Tallis." Neither identifies "Vaughan" (line 32), "Browne: Burton" (line 33), which Van Mierlo finds "illegible" (9), or "Uplands Mouse &amp; Burgess Mouse" (line 40). 13. Edmund Gosse, A Short History of Modern English Literature (London: W.

The reverse order of the list may be explained by the book having been marked as Joyce read, and then the notes recorded as he flipped backwards through his markings. 14.

Dunbar : Ballad to Our Lady, Uplands Mouse &amp; Burgess Mouse James I: The King's Quair Langland: Harrowing of Hell, Piers Plowman With only one exception (see below), all of the information on this list appears in Gosse's book. That the work by Gosse is Joyce's source, and not George Saints- bury's A Short History of English Literature , which also appears to have been among the sources for "Oxen of the Sun," 16 is confirmed by the shared misspellings of the two Scottish poems cited in the third-to-last line: Robert Henryson's "Tale of the Upland Mouse and the Burgess Mouse" and William Dunbar's "A Ballad of Our Lady." 17 Joyce did not catch the errors, and alsointroduced an interpolation of his own, "Giles Farnaby," of whom he must have been remindedby Gosse's mention of Farnaby's predecessor, the composer Thomas Tallis. 18 Further sup- port for the source is found in Joyce's uniquenotes "Fuller (Holy War) wit/Carew (Thos) coarse," which are taken straight from Gosse: Carew invented a species of love-poetry which exactly suited the temper of the time. It was a continuation of the old Elizabethan pastoral, but more personal, more ar- dent, more coarse, and more virile ... [Fuller's] activitybetween 1639 , when he pub- lished the Holy War, and 1661 , when he died, was prodigious … Without endorsing the extravagant praise of Coleridge, we must acknowledge that the wit of Fuller was amazing, if he produced too many examples of it in forms a little too desultory for modern tastes. 19 These unique errors and details confirm that Joyce's source for this genealogy of English literature was indeed Gosse, who had been reluctantly persuaded by Yeats to help Joyce receive a grant in 1915 , although he later became more critical, denouncing the author of Ulysses as "a sort of Marquis de Sade." 20 It is rather ironic, then, that Gosse's book was used in its composition, when he was still considered an ally by Joyce. Some of the titles on this list may have been 16.

III The next important documentation of Joyce's reading during this period is found in his 1918 Zurich notebook, which is composed of notes on books that he consulted in the Zentralbibliothek. Among these works is long assumed to have been the English prose translation of the Odyssey by S. H. Butcher and A. Lang, based on references to Homer's poem in this notebook. 23 However, in his notes to Book 11 of the Odyssey, Joyce refers to Zeus by his Roman name Jove, and to Oedipus' mother as "Jokaste" (Ἰοκάστη), 24 rather than Epicaste as she is called in this particular book of Homer (Od. 11.271). The gloss suggests that Joyce was here instead following the translation by William Cowper, the only one to use Roman names (including "Ulysses") and to specify Jocasta in a footnote. 25 Her- ring's conjecture of "?didipur" 26 for the word under "Jokaste" should obviously be emended to "Oidipus," which is likewise a transliteration of the Greek spell- ing (Οἰδίπους). Atsome point Joyce also obtained his own contemporary copy of this translation that survives from his Trieste library, and it is a version of the tale that he favored more than has been realized, despite his dislike of Cowper's own poetry. 27 Butcher and Lang were certainly read by Joyce too, but there is no evidence that he did so at the Zentralbibliothek. They are not the only old- 21. See e.g. Frank Callanan, "James Joyce and the United Irishman, Paris 1902–3 ," Dublin James Joyce Journal 3 ( 2010 ), 88–89. 22. James Joyce, "I.ii.

IV Another bill dated 20 April 1920 from the bookseller Simmel &amp; Co. in Leipzig contains the name "Joyce" (fig. 2),which Brown has argued denotes a German translation of Joyce's own play Exiles. 29 Brown also reads the previous entry on this bill as "Seawards," suggesting that it refers to Jane Porter's Sir Edward Se- award's Narrative of His Shipwreck . 30 But the actual 1910 catalog from which the five works on this list were ordered (Catalog 229) concerns exclusively philological matters, as announced by its theme: Germanische und Keltische Sprach-und Altertum- skunde. It offered a total of 4,114 items for sale, all of them relating to Germanic and Celtic languages, especially English. These were obviously stylistic sources for "Oxen of the Sun," which Joyce was writing at the time, using Latin and early forms of English and Irish. Had Brown actually found this catalog and looked up no. 346, he would have discovered that "Joyce" is in fact P. W. Joyce's Irish Local Names Explained . 31 This work, it seems, was the realsource of the Gaelic word "Deshil" (Deisiol) at the beginning of that episode (U 14.1), 32 and not the same author's A Social History of Ancient Ireland, as has long been thought. 33 Brown's transcription "Seawards" from the bill turns out simply to be a misreading of "Sea words." The catalog entry for this item (no. 1982 ) reveals the actual Edward not to be Edward Seaward, but Edward FitzGerald, " author of Sea Words and Phrases along the Suffolk Coast , which Joyce is already known to have used for a passage in "Oxen of the Sun" (U 14.1440–1550). 34 28.

V The front and back of the single extant page from Joyce's inventory of his library shelves in Trieste, which he himself took before moving to France in the summer of 1920 , are unquestionably our most important evidence for his back- ground reading at the time. 35 What is nowhere mentioned by Ellmann, or Scholes in his cataloging of this list, 36 is that on the verso of this page, which pertains to "Shelf 3: Back," Joyce significantly writes the words "from Miscellany" in the bottom-right corner (fig. 4), indicating the rather general nature of this second set of books on the inventory. A Norwegian play by Hamsun entitled Ved rigets port that survives from Joyce's Paris library may also be found on the Trieste inventory, 37 suggesting that this was originally a full list, and not merely of the books Joyce left behind that could be sent for later. Several still mysterious items remain on the inventory. None of the entries is as puzzling as the second of the first two titles by Tolstoy (fig. 3): Tolstoi: Saggi Tolstoi: Scritti No one has commented on the contents of the second book, but the first title Saggi ("Essays") appears among Joyce's surviving Trieste books on the cover of a rebound volume that consists of four paperbacks from the "Biblioteca universale" series: Agli uomini politici; La guerra russo-giapponese ( 1911 ), Piaceri crudeli ( 1910 ), Ai soldati, agli operai ( 1912 ), and Ai governanti, ai preti ( 1910 ). 38 Only the first of these four titles is given by Ellmann. 39 Two individual Italian translations of works 35.

This title was first correctly transcribed from the inventory (fig. 3) by Ellmann ( "Joyce's Library in 1920 ," p. 111), but later misrepresented by him in his biography of Joyce ( James Joyce, p. 786) as Ved rikets port, which is the alternative spelling found in an anachronistic edition of the work (Oslo: Gyldendal, 1921 ). The error is unfortunately reproduced by both Gillespie, "A Critique of Ellmann's List of Joyce's Trieste Library," p. 34 and Connolly, "The Personal Library of James Joyce," p. 27. 38.

Ellmann, "Joyce's Library in 1920 ," p. 130; id., James Joyce, p. 785. Contrast Gillespie, James Joyce's Trieste Library, p. 238. by Tolstoy, the play La potenza delle tenebre and his tale Usseri, also survive from Joyce's library. 40 The fact that the first two titles on the inventory were paired on the shelf, and no Italian work by Tolstoy with the title Scritti was published in this era either, suggests that the lost volume was not a novel, but instead like- wise a rebound hardcover made up of another four of Tolstoy's remaining five works in this series: Le imitazioni ( 1901 ), Dal dubbio alla fede ( 1902 ), Katia; Di che vivono gli uomini ( 1902 ), Le confessioni ( 1879–1881 ) ( 1913 ), and Le novelle della morte ( 1919 ). 41 This conjecture may explain the more general title Scritti ("Writings"), rather than Racconti ("Stories"), if this book included the non-fictional work Le confessioni . One entry was misidentified by Ellmann with an extant title from the Trieste library: "21–22. Moliére: Works (2 vols)" (fig. 3). He associated this item with a set of two volumes by Moliére that survives among Joyce's books: Théâtre comp- let illustre ( 1909 ). 42 Ellmann's conjecture was accepted by Gillespie in his com- ments on this work: "This title appears on Joyce's library inventory." 43 However, "Théâtre complet illustré" is by no means written on the inventory, but rather the title "Works," which almost certainly denotes a publication in English. Al- though the French title has the benefit of being a two-volume edition, this cor- respondence is probably coincidental. Joyce may well have read the French texts of Molière's plays as well as English translations. Since Joyce's other citations on the inventory are all precise recordings of titles taken from the books themselves, which generally indicate their language, we should not assume, as Ellmann ap- pears to do, that "Works" is an arbitrary or casual designation. Two English editions of Molière with the title The Works may be suggested, to which these vo- lumes plausibly belonged: Baker and Miller's ten-volume edition of 1748 , which contained both French and English, or Van Laun's twelve-volume edition of 1890 , which was only in English. 44 The latter is preferable by far, due to its more recent publication date and also the fact that Joyce owned a separate French edition, which the former would render unnecessary. If we are to determine the exact two volumes from the translation by Van Laun that were in Joyce's library, the second and eighth volumes in particular are strong possibilities, containing translations of the plays Sganarelle, ou Le cocu imaginaire and George Dandin, ou Le 40.

Tolstoi: Ehe." 46 Gillespie has since similarly connected this transcription with the surviving copy of that work from Joyce's Trieste library, which had not been noticed by Ellmann, but supports his case. 47 While the abbreviation of this title as "Ehe" would cer- tainly have been possible, when we inspect the actual line itself, we see that Joyce instead wrote "Ehre" (fig. 3), as Brown has already noted, despite his acceptance of Ellmann's conjecture: "Ellmann is to be thanked for identifying '32. Tolstoi: Ehre' as Der Roman der Ehe ." 48 On the contrary, I should argue that this work is rather the play Die Ehre ( 1889 ) by Hermann Sudermann, whose later dramatic work Heimat ( 1893 ) was attended by Joyce in its English production Magda during his youth, and he purchased two other plays by this author a couple of years later in Italian translations. 49 The error on the inventory no doubt originated with Joyce himself. It is easy to see how he could have mistakenly written "Tolstoi" for the author of this work, since Sudermann's drama was greatly influenced by Tolstoy, and the two writers are often compared. Even Joyce could have recalled the wrong author for a book with the Tolstoyan title Die Ehre . It would not be the only mistake on the extant page of the inventory: Joyce not only misspells Hueffer's The Troubadours as "Trobadours" (fig. 4), which Ellmann did correct, but also misnumbers as "21–22" what should have been "22–23" on the front, and as "26" what should have been "25" on the back. 50 Ellmann errs in his transcription of a language book on Joyce's inventory, just as he did with his linguistic textbooks in French and German. This time, it is an Italian course book for learning English. At the back of Joyce's third shelf, he records a further four books that are carelessly transcribed by Ellmann: 51 1. Ferdinando Bracciforti, Grammatica della lingua inglese 2. Bracciforti, Chiave dei temi sceneggiati 7–8. Melani, Lettera italiana (2 vols.) 12. History of Excess 45.

As Brown, "Addenda and Corrigenda," p. 317 n. 11 observes, Ellmann ( James Joyce, p. 786) only takes note of the second of these misnumberings with "[sic]." For another typo by Joyce on the inventory, see the discussion of the entry "14. Mercredy: Map of Ireland" below. 51. These transcriptions are again from Ellmann, "Joyce's Library in 1920 ," pp. 102, 112, 119. Compare also id., James Joyce , p. 786. The second entry is based on the line "2. Bracciforti: Temi Sceneggiati" from Joyce's inventory (fig. 4), but the title supplied by Ellmann is that of a different work, the fifth and final part of the English language textbook Corso graduato e completo di lingua inglese, which was revised by Ferdinando Bracciforti . 52 Once again, we must differentiate between an original text and its answer book. As with Schlüssel, Ellmann does not recognize that Chiave is Italian for "Key." Joyce must instead have had the fourth volume of this course, entitled simply Temi sceneggiati, to which the work identified by Ellmann merely provides the solutions. 53 These books do not so much inform Ulysses as the daily life of a professor of languages that surrounded its composition. This last book, however, does have bearing on the early material for Ulysses in Giacomo Joyce, since it is for the private lessons of the Italian student behind it that the textbook was almost certainly used by Joyce. The third and fourth entries above require closer examination of the inven- tory's manuscript, for they were not misidentified, but rather misread in the first place, which has hindered their identification. Let us take "7–8. Melani, Lettera italiana (2 vols.)." 54 As comparison with Joyce's handwritten entry itself proves (fig. 4), this title is actually to be identified with Alfredo Melani's Pittura italiana ( 1885–1886 ), a discovery which is particularly interesting in light of the fact that Joyce's knowledge of the history of painting has formerly been questioned. 55 As the presence of this book in his library demonstrates, his interest in the subject was greater than has been thought. In fact, he may have appreciated one of this book's illustrations in particular, a Vatican fresco depicting the visit to Hades in Homer's Odyssey. 56 The third entry, given by Ellmann as "12. History of Excess," has also been misread in the most tantalizingly scandalous way. Although Joyce had read several pornographic works, this was not one of them, despite the general acceptance of Ellmann's false interpretation in later discussions, which describe the work as "erotic," "prurient," and "unrecoverable." 57 If we are fa- miliar with Joyce's hand, we know that he usually begins his uppercase "G" with 52.

Hodgson: Errors in Use of English" and "9. Eliot: Mill on the Floss" from the preceding lines. 58 This detail discounts any possibility that the last word of the second title is "Excess," since it does indeed have an initial loop (fig. 4). The next thing to notice is the second letter of this word, which Ellmann takes for an "x," but which could only be one if it was left uncrossed. This seems un- likely, and the alternative proposition that it should instead be an "r," which fits Joyce's handwriting perfectly, must therefore be preferred. We might compare the "Gr" in "Grammatica Inglese" at the top of the same page, denoting the second part of the Italian course discussed above. 59 A much better conjecture now presents itself: the word is not "Excess," but "Greece." a Comparison with the word "Greece" in a handwritten letter by Joyce from 1905 confirms the reading. 60 What could be a more fitting title in the library of the man writing Ulysses than History of Greece? This title also suits the themes of other miscellaneous works at the back of this shelf, such as John Lingard's A History of England, Thomas and Katharine Macquoid's Pictures &amp; Legends from Normandy &amp; Brittany, 61 and Gu- glielmo Ferrero's L'Europa giovane. Because Joyce gives no author, it is uncertain which exact work is meant, as there are a few single-volume books with the title History of Greece that were avail- able in Joyce's day. 62 However, we have seen that he was particularly interested in historical accounts by Irish scholars such as P. W. Joyce, and the History of Greece in question is therefore probably the student's book by W. F. Collier, 63 whose History of Ireland for Schools was certainly used by Joyce for Ulysses. 64 It makes sense that he would also have used an Irish history of Greece for his own Irish version 58. The latter entry was first correctly identified with Joyce's surviving edition of George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss by Ellmann (" Joyce's Library in 1920 ," p. 107), but subsequently mistranscribed by him as " The Mill on the Foss" James Joyce, p. 786). For the extant copy of this book, see Gillespie, James Joyce's Trieste Library, p. 89. 59. John Millhouse, Grammatica analitica (Turin: Presso l'autore, 1842 ). The most recent publication of this volume was the sixteenth edition by Ferdinando Bracciforti ( Milan: G. Ber- nardoni, 1896 ). Ellmann's conjecture Grammatica della lingua inglese should more precisely be emended to Corso graduate e completo di lingua inglese, parte II: grammatica analitica. 60.

Thomas and Katharine Macquoid, Pictures &amp; Legends from Normandy &amp; Brittany ( Lon- don: Chatto and Windus, 1879 ). This work corresponds to the entry "11. Macquoid: Legends of Normandy &amp; Brittany" (fig. 4). Only one of its authors is cited by Ellmann, "Joyce's Library in 1920 ," p. 118; cf. id., James Joyce, p. 786. A second edition of this work was also published in 1881 . 62. See e.g. J. R. and Catharine Morell, History of Greece ( London: T. J. Allman, 1873 ); C.A. Fyffe, History of Greece ( London: Macmillan and Co., 1875 ). 63. W. F. Collier, History of Greece ( London: T. Nelson and Sons, 1866 ). 64. Id., History of Ireland for Schools, 4th ed. ( London: Marcus Ward &amp; Co., c. 1888 ). See Gillespie, James Joyce's Trieste Library, pp. 74–75; Tymoczko, The Irish Ulysses, pp. 27–28, 119, 224–225; Andrew Gibson, Joyce's Revenge: History, Politics, and Aesthetics in Ulysses (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 2002 ), 85, 92–93. of Homer. Four allusions in the novel corroborate Collier as the most likely source for Joyce's references to Greek history. The first is at the very beginning of Ulysses, when Buck Mulligan says to Stephen: "Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them in the original. Thalatta! Thalatta! She is our great sweet mother" ( U 1.79–80). Molly repeats this phrase in English at the end of her soliloquy: "the sea the sea" ( U 18. 1598 ). These allusions are to the shout of Cyrus the Younger's army, the Ten Thousand, towards the end of Xenophon's Anabasis, when they reach the mountains (Xen. An. 4.7.24). But Joyce need not have read an edition of this ancient work itself. He could instead have drawn the phrase from Collier, who not only preserves the same Greek transliteration "Thalatta, Thallata" as a subheading to his chapter "The Ten Thousand," but also narrates the historical moment itself: After forcing their way through hosts of barbarians, the vanguard reached the summit of the ridge Theches (now Kóp Tagh), and with tear-dimmed eyes saw the waters of the Euxine heaving against the northern horizon. From rank to rank, in the var- ious dialects of the Grecian tongue, a joyous cry spread: The Sea! the Sea! and weather-worn warriors fell sobbing on their comrades' necks, as they thought of their escape. 65 Joyce's next reference occurs in the "Nestor" episode. Stephen asks the students in his class, "What was the end of Pyrrhus?" ( U 2.18), and then recalls how the great Greek general had ironically "fallen by a beldam's hand in Argos" ( U 2.48). This was by no means the only version of the tale, but it is the exact same variant accepted and told by Collier: "Pyrrhus then turned away to Argos … a tile, flung from a housetop by a woman, stunned Pyrrhus, and an enemy cut off his head." 66 Joyce again appears to follow Collier for the battle of Aegospotami, 65. Collier, History of Greece, p. 78. It is thought by R. J. Schork, Greek and Hellenic Culture in Joyce (Gainesville: Univ. Press of Florida, 1998 ), 29 that Joyce himself must have read this passage directly in school, but there is no evidence for his acquaintance with Xenophon's origi- nal text. We might compare Kerouac's later knowledge of the phrase indirectly from Joyce; see Christopher Gair, "'Thalatta! Thalatta!' Xenophon, Joyce, and Kerouac," in Hip Sublime: Beat Writers and the Classical Tradition, ed. Sheila Murnaghan and Ralph M. Rosen (Columbus: Ohio State Univ. Press, 2018 ), 38–54. The Xenophonic phrase "Thence they advanced five parasangs" ( U 15. 1450 ), which Schork considers an "extraordinarily cryptic" allusion to the Anabasis, is simply clichéd, much like the proverbial expression to "appeal from Philip drunk to Philip sober," on which Joyce similarly plays ( U 15.2512). Both references had in fact become removed from their original contexts, being widely used in popular culture, and therefore re- quired no first-hand reading of classical literature; see Gifford and Seidman, Ulysses Annotated, pp. 442, 496 respectively. As Schork himself concedes (p. 29), Joyce's knowledge of Greek his- tory was "largely mediated" by modern sources. It may also be worth noting that this formula imitated by Joyce is also frequently found in the Jewish writer Benjamin of Tudela's account of his march to Jerusalem; see e.g. The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, ed. Marcus Nathan Adler ( London: H. Frowde, 1907 ), 43: "Thence it is five parasangs to Hillah, where there are 10,000 Israelites and four Synagogues." 66. Collier, History of Greece, pp. 117–118. For the different reports of Pyrrhus' death, see Petros Garoufalias, Pyrrhus, King of Epirus ( London: Stacey International, 1979 ), 140–141. However, the "gorescarred book" ( U 2.12–13) with which Stephen teaches the class is more likely based on Collier's companion volume on Roman history, where the names of the places "Tarentum" ( U 2.2) and "Asculum" ( U 2.12) may be found in a fuller account of Pyrrhus, as well as this same story of his death; see W. F. Collier, History of Rome ( London: T. Nelson and Sons, 1867 ), 35–37. when Professor MacHugh mentions the "chivalry of Europe … that went under with the Athenian fleets of Aegospotami" ( U 7.566–568). This closely accords with the vivid description of this event's outcome in Collier, especially his refer- ence to "the Athenian fleet": Retribution, swift and complete, came next year at Aegospotami in the strait of the Hellespont, wither the Athenian fleet had followed Lysander and his ships … On the fifth day Lysander's spy-galleys hoisted a shield, when they saw the Athenians out of their ships—and then down, like a cloud of sharp-beaked falcons, darted the waiting squadrons of the Spartans. 67 Joyce's reference to "Pisistratus" in the "Oxen of the Sun" episode ( U 14.1112) seems no less owed to Collier, who devotes a chapter to the tyrant in his book. 68 These four rather specific details from Greek history, although hardly recondite, establish the source with great certainty when taken together, especially the view that Pyrrhus was killed by a roof tile in Argos, rather than by Antigonus' troops, since all of them are contained in Collier's work. History of Greece provided material for the Hellenism of Joyce's characters, in keeping with his generally Homeric theme. With regard to the ancient past, Joyce relied not only on biographical sources such as Plutarch and Suetonius, 69 but also read the more current histories by Collier. In one case, it is certainly Joyce who nodded, and Ellmann who did not discover the typo on the inventory. Two entries after History of Greece (fig. 4), we find what Ellmann transcribes as "14. Mercredy, Map of Ireland." 70 This work has never been discovered, and for good reason: Joyce miswrites the name of "R. J. Mecredy," whose road and neighborhood maps of Ireland were very popular at the time, especially those for cyclists and tourists. Mecredy himself was a famous Irish cyclist and writer who had published a full Road Map of Ireland, 71 which is probably the title on the inventory, but also sold five smaller sections separately for Kerry, Donegal, Connemara, Down, and East Central Ireland, as well as various maps of Dublin. Joyce's error may be understood as a common example of metathesis, where the letters "cr" became rearranged as "rc" in his original transcription. Four other titles on Joyce's 1920 inventory have indeed been properly tran- scribed, but never correctly located. The first was identified by Ellmann as the same work as the German volume Katharina II that survives from Trieste, since 67. Collier, History of Greece, pp. 72–73. 68. Ibid., pp. 27–31. 69. Joyce owned an English copy of Plutarch's biography of Alcibiades, in which there is also an account of the battle of Aegospotami ( Alc. 36–37): J. and W. Langhorne, Plutarch's Lives of Alcibiades &amp; Coriolanus, Aristides &amp; Cato the Censor (New York: Cassell &amp; Co., 1886 ), 55–56. See Gillespie, James Joyce's Trieste Library, pp. 185–186. On Joyce's use of Suetonius, see Tristan Power, "Bloom and Caligula," Notes and Queries 63 ( 2016 ), 288–291. 70. Ellmann, "Joyce's Library in 1920 ," p. 119; id., James Joyce, p. 786. This inaccurate transcription is repeated by Robert Scholes, Protocols of Reading (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1989 )&gt; 32. 71. R. J. Mecredy, Road Map of Ireland (Dublin: R. J. Mecredy &amp; Co., 1900 ). This is not to be confused with the same author's Road Book of Ireland, which had been published in 1892 . he cites the inventory parenthetically. 72 However, as with Molière's Théâtre com- plet illustré, the existence of Katharina II does not preclude Joyce from having also acquired translations of Sacher-Masochian stories about Catherine the Great. If we look at the inventory (fig. 3), the spelling of the title is in fact slightly different: "41. Masoch: Catherine II." This spelling suggests that Joyce refers instead to an English collection. Either of the following therefore fits better: Tales of the Court of Catherine II, and Other Stories ( 1896 ), or Venus and Adonis, and Other Tales of the Court of Catherine II ( 1896 ). 73 As the latter contains translations of several of the tales already collected in Katharina II, including "Disgrace at Any Price," to which Joyce alludes in Ulysses 74 the former seems the more likely, especially because the abbreviated title on the cover of this book of entirely different stories reads "Tales of Catherine II," which Joyce could have simply recorded as "Catherine II." It may be relevant to Joyce's Exiles that Tales of the Court of Catherine II, and Other Stories contains a translation of Guy de Maupassant's brief story "L'épingle" about a man who wishes to be sexually betrayed by his beloved, which is falsely attributed to Sacher-Masoch and significantly entitled "The Exile." 75 The second title on Joyce's inventory that has not been precisely pinpointed is recorded two entries later in the same part of the inventory: "43–46. Masoch: Grausame Frauen (4 vols)." Brown connects it with a 1905 book by Sacher- Masoch published under this title, 76 but despite the fact that this book has been mistaken for a third volume of the first edition of Grausame Frauen, it is merely a reprint of the second volume of that edition, which contained only two volumes in total. 77 Since Joyce owned at least four unspecified volumes of this title, which were presumably all from the same edition, they probably belonged to the expanded six-volume edition published in 1907 . 78 A passage from one story in 72. Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, Katharina II: russische Hofgeschichten (Berlin: Schreiter, 1898 ). See Ellmann, "Joyce's Library in 1920 ," p. 126, equating this work with the inventory entry "Catherine II" that is transcribed in his biography of Joyce James Joyce, p. 786). 73. Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, Tales of the Court of Catherine II, and Other Stories ( London: Ma- thieson, 1896 ); id., Venus and Adonis, and Other Tales of the Court of Catherine II ( London: Mathieson, 1896 ). Joyce knew at least one Mathieson edition of Paul de Kock's novel The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays ( U 15.1023–1024); see Weldon Thornton, Allusions in Ulysses: An Annotated List (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1968 ), p. 74. 74. See Power, "Married His Cook to Massach," pp. 146–147. 75. "The Exile," in Sacher-Masoch, Tales of the Court of Catherine II, and Other Stories, pp. 115–122. 76. Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, Grausame Frauen (Leipzig: Leipziger Verlag, 1905 ). See Richard Brown, James Joyce and Sexuality (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1985 ), 182 n. 93. 77. Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, Hinterlassene Novellen: Grausame Frauen, 2 vols. (Dresden: H. R. Dohrn, 1901 ). Michael Farin, "Sacher-Masoch-Bibliographie 1856–2003 ," in Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, ed. Ingrid Spörk and Alexandra Strohmaier (Graz: Droschl, 2002 ), 319 incorrectly lists the 1905 Grausame Frauen as a third edition. Farin (p. 318) also omits the story "Bovo" from the 1898 Schreiter edition of Sacher-Masoch's Liebesgeschichten (pp. 245–284) that was owned by Joyce; contrast Gillespie, James Joyce's Trieste Library, p. 198. 78. Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, Grausame Frauen, 2nd ed., 6 vols. (Leipzig: Leipziger Verlag, 1907 ). It seems unlikely, based on Joyce's recording of his four books under this single title, that he had a mixture of volumes from this edition and the later three-volume edition in the "Galante Bibliothek" series, which contains two reprinted volumes of the 1907 edition in each book: Dämonen und Sirenen (Leipzig: G. H. Wigand, 1920 ), Grausame Frauen (Leipzig: G. H. Wigand, 1920 ), Das Rätsel Weib (Leipzig: G. H. Wigand, 1920 ). Joyce may simply have kept the remaining two volumes of the 1907 edition on a different shelf, or have had them out to read, since he was just beginning "Circe". the sixth volume, "The Red Manor-House," has been compared to the "Circe" episode, but without reference to Joyce's inventory. 79 Since no strong allusion to that tale in Ulysses has been established to support Joyce's knowledge of this volume, it need not have been among the four that he owned. The third entry that has never been found is "30. Ohnet: La Via della Gloria" (fig. 4), an Ital- ian translation of Georges Ohnet's novel Le chemin de la gloire. 80 There were two editions by this title: a 1904 complete translation, and a 1910 abridged version. 81 Which text Joyce owned is revealed only once we identify the fourth unknown title, Ohnet's Eva, which immediately precedes it on the inventory, and is a dif- ferent 1910 abridged version of the same novel, taking its name instead from the story's heroine ève Brillant. 82 Joyce's La via della gloria was therefore more likely the unabridged version, since he already had at least one abridged copy. This love-triangle novel concerns a female soprano caught between two musical art- ists, a plot which may have given Joyce the idea of making Molly a singer who is having an affair with her musical colleague Boylan. 83 It was clearly of enough interest to Joyce that he tracked down two Italian copies, including probably a full edition of the work. VI Lastly, two other literary histories that were used by Joyce can be discovered from another set of notes that he compiled at a late stage in the composition of Ulysses. At the end of one of his four extant Ulysses notebooks, there is a list of fourteen titles relating to French and Italian drama: 84 Bataille – Le Scandale Wolff – L'Amour Défendu Guitry – Le Veilleur de Nuit Guinon – Le Bonheur 79. Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, "Der rote Edelhof," in Grausame Frauen ( 1907 ), 6: 94–96. See David Cotter , James Joyce and the Perverse Ideal ( London : Routledge, 2003 ), 215–218, following a late twentieth-century translation of the story. 80.

Giuseppe Dominione (Naples: Società editrice Parteno- pea, 1910 ). Ellmann, " Joyce's Library in 1920 ," p. 121 does not identify this work, and even mistakenly attributes it to the Schimpff bill by stating "Purchased Trieste, 1913–14 ," possibly confusing "Ohnet" with "Oriani" in that bill's entry "Oriani, Gelosia" (fig. 1). 83.

Notebook," Joyce Papers 2002 , Department of Manuscripts, National Library of Ireland , MS 36,639/5/A, p. 60. The list is mostly transcribed by Rose, The Dublin Ulysses Papers 4: 438–439, who does not identify two of the works: Abel Hermant, Monsieur de Courpière ( Paris : L'illustration, 1907 ); Margherita Emplosi Gherardi, Il nudo nelleèanime: impressioni sceniche ( Rome : P. Maglione and C. Strini , 1919 ). Bernard – L'Accord Parfait Guitry – Mari, Femme et Amant Farjolle – Qui Perd Gagne – Monsieur de Courpière Soffici – La Giostra dei Sensi Gherardi – Il Nudo nelle Anime Savinio – Ermafrodito Venditti – Quells che t'assomiglia – Uccello del Paradiso Maugham – Moon and Sixpence Rose claims that this list is "not in Joyce's handwriting," 85 but the writing in fact bears all the hallmarks of his script. The first eight titles are from Paul Abram's Notes de critique littéraire et dramatique, with the exception of Guitry's Le mari, la femme et l'amant, of which Joyce may have been reminded by the above note on they same author's Le veilleur de nuit . 86 The source Notes de critique littéraire et dramatique is especially noteworthy, because the chapter from it that Joyce utilized on these French plays specifically addresses the character of "the ridiculous husband": cette fois les hommes prirent leur revanche. Ils créèrent le mari-héros. Des courants d'opinion y avaient préparé … Ce sont là des notions dont ont profité les dramaturges modernes. Ils ont ainsi montré que, parce qu'un homme devenait un mari, il n'en demeurait pas moins un homme. Ils ont su lui conserver un cœur et le faire souffrir, tout comme un amant malheureux ou révolté. This time the men have taken their revenge. They have created the husband-hero. Currents of opinion had laid the groundwork … These notions have profited mod- ern playwrights. They have shown that, even though a man may be a husband, he remains nonetheless a man. They have preserved his heart and made him suffer, like an unhappy lover or rebel. 87 Abram's discussion was published in 1913 , the same year that Joyce wrote the surviving notes to his own dramatic work Exiles, which, as the following passage shows, are concerned with the very same literary theme: Since the publication of the lost pages of Madame Bovary the centre of sympathy ap- pears to have been esthetically shifted from the lover or fancyman to the husband or cuckold. This displacement is also rendered more stable by the gradual growth of a collective practical realism … Praga in La Crisi and Giacosa in Tristi Amori have understood and profited by this change ... 88 85.

Although these antecedents are more wide-ranging authors and works than those that appear in Abram, Joyce's notes bear signs of influence by Abram's discus- sion of French plays in their rather similar contextualization and phrasing. The overlapping date of this book's publication with the early stage of Exiles can also hardly be a coincidence. Besides these points, the confirmation of Joyce's acquaintance with the work in his Ulysses notebook now establishes it as the most likely direct inspiration for his examples of the adultery theme in the notes to his own play, and for his perception of an overall trend in literature towards the popular figure of the cuckold. The other book that Joyce uses here is Idling in Italy by Joseph Collins, with whom he was personally acquainted. 89 Collins' book is the Italian source for the last six items on the same list from one of Joyce's Ulysses notebooks, including his puzzling last entry The Moon and Sixpence, which is the only English novel. 90 These notes suggest that he did not read either source carefully, mistaking the character of René Farjolle in Pierre Veber's Qui perd gagne for the play's author, based on his misunderstanding of a line in Abram : "l'impudent Farjolle de Qui perd gagne ou le cynique Monsieur de Courpières." 91 Joyce also misattributes to Mario Venditti the plays Quella che t'assomiglia and L'uccello del paradise, which were in fact written by Enrico Cavacchioli . The confusion is explained by the fact that the two authors are discussed one after the other in Collins' book. 92 This list of books relating to drama appears on the very last page of the notebook, and does not match the rest of it, which is organized according to headings and written with a different pen. Nonetheless, it indicates that Joyce returned at the end of writing Ulysses to an interest in the same kind of love-triangle plays that he had read for Exiles, as well as to the sort of literary histories that he had used in his early subject note- book for the novel. Both general works by Abram and Collins should therefore be included in Joyce's library, together with his other survey books on English literature, Italian painting, Greek history, and Irish geography. The existing evidence for the books that Joyce owned or had read when he was writing Ulysses is greater than has been realized, and it has been generally undervalued by critics, who have not been sufficiently diligent in their assessment of the surviving documents relating to his library. Too often they have relied on the faulty transcriptions by Ellmann , or have not thoroughly pursued the identifications of unknown titles, considering them impossible to discover. There has also been a tendency to connect items on Joyce's inventory with his library's remains, and an undue willingness to make the two fit neatly. However, Joyce was a multilingual writer who sometimes consulted various editions of the same work in more than one language. The wide attention to his more recently uncovered drafts and notebooks has distracted from older manuscripts that have 89. See David Hayman , " Dr J.

By giving greater attention to the subtleties of Joyce's handwriting, and to his citations of the works that he owned, entirely new sources for Ulysses have been found that may now be compared with the novel, improving our knowledge about the origin of much of its material. L'ARCHITECTURE VIVANTE AND ITS EXTRAITS by Daniel Lawler * JEAN Badovici, a Romanian by birth, studied architecture in Paris at the École des Beaux Arts and the École Spéciale d'Architecture, where he earned his degree in 1919 . His subsequent architectural practice consisted largely in his participation in the post-WWII reconstruction of several towns innortheast France , and a minor role in his earlier collaboration on his own houses in Vézelay and Cap-Martin with his then-lover, the Irish designer Eileen Gray. But it was as an editor and author, in books and periodicals throughout the 1920 s and 30s, that he played a pivotal role in the documentation and dissemination of the international architectural avant-garde. And the informal architectural education he provided Gray, along with the publication of its most prominent result – the house at Cap-Martin known as E.1027 – both gave birth to and preserved one of the era's residential masterpieces. Badovici published his first book, Maisons de rapport de Charles Plumet , for Éditions Albert Morancé in early 1923 . 1 On the strengthof this one book, Morancé's friendly rival, Albert Levy, recruited Badovici to edit a revival of the review l'Architecte , which had ceased publication at the start of the first World War. Badovici signed a contract on May 30th, promising the first monthly issue for February 1924 , as well as two books each year similar to the one on Plumet; suggested subjects included Plumet (again), Sauvage, Perret,Süe et Mare, and Dervaux. The contract, however, was voided the same day, as Levy balked at the cost of supporting both Badovici and Christian Zervos – Badovici's friend, roommate, and fellow Morancé editor – as co-editors. It is unclear whether this dual editorship was planned from the start (it is not mentioned in Badovici's * My research for this essay was aided by a number of people and institutions. A grant from the Professional Staff Congress – City University of New York allowed me to examine the Jean Badovici papers at the Getty Research Library in Los Angeles. The staff at that librarywas enormously helpful, as were the staffs at the other libraries I visited: Avery Library at Columbia University, The New York Public Library, The Architecture Library at City College of New York , Beinecke Rare Book Library at Yale University, Frances Loeb Library at Harvard University, Marquand Library at Princeton University, and the Library at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The Fondation Le Corbusier and the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation Archives sent copies of relevant correspondence, and numerous other librarians, booksellers, and collectors answered detailed questions and provided valuable information. Mary McLeod provided encouragement and contacts; Traugott Lawler proof-read drafts and fixed my grammatical errors; Aine Zimmerman and Sylvaine Frances translated German and French; Caroline Constant and Jean-Louis Cohen shared their enormous knowledge; Malte Knigge contributed several crucial discoveries; and Sally Gilliland made all of it possible. 1. Jean Badovici , ed., Maisons de rapport de Charles Plumet ( Paris: éditions Albert Morancé , 1923 ). contract), or was a last-minute demand, perhaps even a deliberate scuttling of the deal, by Badovici. Within six months of these negotiations, however, Badovici and Éditions Albert Morancé had produced the first installment of their own review, l'Architecture Vivante. It is hard to imagine that Badovici would consider Levy's offer had work on l'Architecture Vivante already begun; rather, it is likely that this episode instigated the founding of l'Architecture Vivante and its related publications. 2 Badovici continued to produce books for Éditions Albert Morancé: four new titles in the next two years and one in 1927 , all under the heading "Documents d''Architecture " and outside his efforts at l''Architecture Vivante. 3 By this time, though, V.'Architecture Vivante was changing. Not only did its editorial outlook move away from Perret's rappel a l'ordre toward Le Corbusier's machine aesthetic, but the contents of each issue abandoned the review's earlier survey approach and became decidedly monographic in nature. This ultimately led to the republishing of most issues as stand-alone titles: twenty-four of the final twenty-six fascicules (out of forty-two total) were reissued in this way, including all of the final twenty- one. These reissued titles were designated "Extraits de l'Architecture Vivante," and kept the review's name on their covers, although with altered typography. Their content remained virtually unchanged from the original review issues, but their new titles and format elevated their status from ephemeral review to iconic book. The series also extended the l'Architecture Vivante franchise, adding several new titles after the review itself ceased publication. Despite their importance as primary documents of the European avant garde of the 1920 s and 1930 s, the twenty-eight books ultimately included in this series are relatively unknown, and their relationship to the review that spawned them confusing, at best. They are often dated incorrectly, or catalogued misleadingly: the primary bibliography on Le Corbusier, for instance, could not even state conclusively the number of volumes in the series dedicated to him, and the bibliographer appears to have actually seen only three volumes. 4 It is the goal of 2. The contract between Badovici and Albert Levy (torn neatly into nine pieces and placed in an envelope), Levy's letter of retraction to Badovici and Zervos, and Zervos's reply (also torn) are part of the Jean Badovici Papers held at the Getty Research Institute Library, Santa Monica , California.

As no archive survives for Éditions Albert Morancé , the information available is greatly limited. I have relied on the Catalogue Valdras , issued each January from 1930 to 1936 , and "Biblio" , which began publication in 1935 , for most of the publication dates proposed here; both provided comprehensive lists of all books published in France the previous year. 5 Catalogs printed by Morancé in 1932 and 1938 provided further material. 6 Other details surfaced in the Jean Badovici Papers at the Getty Research Institute, the Fondation Le Corbusier, and the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, but most are from direct observation of the books themselves. Images of the covers of each item below, along with bibliographical details of the copies I examined, appear on the website of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia (www.bsuva.org).

The article concludes with a list of the images on the website. 1. L'ARCHITECTURE VIVANTE A description of any of these volumes necessarily entails an understanding of the physical makeup of the underlying review. L'Architecture Vivante was published quarterly, from Autumn 1923 to Winter 1933 , in forty two fascicules in portfolio form. Each began with a series of half or full sheets (45 cm × 54cm for the full sheets), folded once or twice respectively, to form loose signatures of fouror eight pages. These were left uncut by the publisher, and often by the purchasers as well. These pages, typically numbering sixteen per fascicule, contained commentary by Badovici , texts by featured architects, and a wealth of documentary drawings showing plans, elevations, sections, and detailsof the works illustrated in the photographic plates that followed. The plates themselves, typically numbering twenty-five per fascicule, were luxuriously printed 5. Catalogue Valdras: Livres publiés en France en 1929 ( Paris: Vald. Rasmussen, 1930 ). Subsequent titles cover the years 1930 through 1935 . "Biblio" 1934 : Catalogue français ( Paris: Service Bibliographique des Messageries Hachette, 1935 ). Subsequent titles through 1939 were also consulted. 6. Librairie Française d'art et d'architecture ( Paris , Librairie Frangaise, 1932 ). Éditions Albert Morancé ( Paris , Éditions Albert Morancé , 1938 ). The Librairie Française was the bookselling arm of Éditions Albert Morancé , located at the same address, 30–32 Rue de Fleurus. Although they sold books from other publishers, the 1932 catalog listed only those by Éditions Albert Morancé. The bound-in price list, dated 1 January 1932 , includes a supplement of seven volumes not found in the main text of the catalog, where the listing for l'Architecture Vivante refers to both 1931 volumes as being in preparation; the catalog itself must have been typeset in the Summer of 1931 . The later catalog is undated, but internal evidence strongly suggests a 1938 printing. on heavy bristol board – single sided, and usually just one image per sheet – using heliography, an expensive and lustrous process revived from the late 19th century. Drawings were sometimes included among the plates, and were occasionally colored using the pochoir stencil process. Each fascicule, or issue, came in a paper portfolio cover, dated according to the season (printemps , été, automne, hiver); these dates were repeated on each individual plate of that issue as well (fig. 1.1, plate 1). But each pair of fascicules ( printemps/été, automne/hiver) was intended to be joined together to make a single volume, with numbering in both the text section and plate section continuous across each pair. A subscriber to the review had an option to purchase, at a cost of 10 francs per year (above the yearly rate, which grew from 100 francs to 150 francs across the lifespan of the review), a cardboard portfolio cover showing the combined dates, and issued with the second fascicule of each pair (fig. 1.2). 7 To take an example: in the Autumn of 1924 , after taking a subscription, your first issue of the review arrives. It is in a paper cover, which is dated automne mcm xxiv. Inside, the first four-page signature contains a one-page sommaire, listing the contents of the present fascicule, followed by three pages of advertisements. Another four-page signature contains the unpaginated front matter: half-title, publisher's page, title, and a final blank page – but here the title page is dated automne – hiver mcm xxiv. The following signatures, of eight and four pages, are numbered from 5 to 16, and contain the issue's three texts, plus six pages of documentary drawings. Next are the plates, numbered 1–25, and all dated automne mcm xxiv. Three months later the next issue arrives, also in a paper cover, this one dated hiver mcm xxiv. Inside, again, is a loose signature containing this issue's sommaire and advertisements. It is followed by two eight- page signatures numbered 17–32, with texts and drawings, and including a table of contents covering the texts, drawings, and plates of both fascicules. The plates that follow are numbered 26–50, and are dated hiver mcm xxiv. The paper- covered cardboard portfolio cover for the combined volume, which you have purchased, matches the fascicule covers typographically, but is dated automne – hiver mcm xxiv. With this in hand, you now discard the two paper covers along with the sommaires and their associated advertising pages. The sixteen pages of text from the first fascicule are joined with those of the second to make a continuously numbered run of thirty-two pages, with a combined title page at the front and a combined table of contents at the rear. The fifty plates are then inserted consecutively, and the volume is complete. The reassembly of the fascicules into volumes creates a problem for designating the location of any particular text or plate, especially since the fascicules often remained unintegrated. Badovici's own numbering system didn't help: each fascicule was given a sequential number, from 1–42, as well as the ordinal year of the review, from first to eleventh (the Spring 1925 issue, for example, was 7. The additional charge for the volume portfolio covers is described in a note to subscribers, loosely inserted into the Summer 1925 fascicule of the review. See both copies of this fascicule in the Eisenman Collection, Beinecke Rare Book Library, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. numbered "troisième année, numéro 7"). But this appeared only on themasthead of the sommaire; when this was discarded to create full volumes, the numbering system disappeared. The volume spines gave the sequence in a new manner: the calendar year followed by I or II, to designate the first (printemps/été) or second (automne/hiver) volume of that year. To further complicate matters, the numbering of the fascicules didn't begin until the third year, with number 7; the four fascicules of 1928 are incorrectly designated "cinquième année," repeating that of 1927 ; and the first three fascicules of 1931 are numbered 35–37, instead of 31–33 as they should have been. There are other anomalies. The Spring and Summer issues of 1929 were issued together, in a single paper portfolio cover bearingboth dates; no sommaires were necessary, as the table of contents at the end of the text was sufficient, which also meant that these issues were unnumbered, although the numbering of the following issues took them into account. The same is also true of the Spring and Summer issues of 1932 . The Autumn 1930 issue contained the entire text of the completed volume, again leaving no reason for the sommaires and their numbers; the Winter 1930 issue consisted solely of its 25 plates. The numbering of the individual fascicules was certainly an afterthought by Badovici , perhaps in recognition that many of the issues sold were not being collated into volumes, as intended. And considering that almost half of them were either unnumbered or misnumbered, it seems prudent to locate an article in, say, volume II of 1929 , rather than number 26. In the 1976 Da Capo reprint of the review, this is the method taken in compiling a new comprehensive index, even though the twenty-one original volumes have been condensed to five. 8 This method makes most sense with the earlier volumes, where the variety of projects shown makes their incorporation into a larger volume more natural. It also works in certain later volumes, where both fascicules followed the same theme. But in many cases the numbering of individual issues makes a clearer distinction of how the review was received. Number 26, mentioned above, was dedicated entirely to Eileen Gray and Jean Badovici's house, E.1027; all subscribers and bookstore purchasers received a publication single-mindedly devoted to this narrow topic, 8. L'Architecture Vivante ( New York: Da Capo Press, 1975 ). Five volumes. The organization of the reprint, for the most part, follows Badovici's intentions of combining each pair of fascicules into volumes, but there are some odd exceptions. Most glaringly, the 1930 I volume has not been integrated into a continuously paginated entity, instead retaining the arrangement of the separate fascicules: the front matter for the combined issue is followed by pages 5–48 and plates 1–25, all from the Spring fascicule; then follows the sommaire for the Summer 1930 fascicule, plus one advertising page; then pages 49–76, which include the table of contents for both issues, and plates 26–50; finally the two remaining pages of ads from the Summer 1930 sommaire signature. The separation of the advertisements suggests that their four-page sommaire signature was originally placed to envelop the remaining signatures, rather than preceding them – an arrangement I have seen several times in extant fascicules. At the conclusion of the 1925 I volume, Da Capo again prints two advertising pages from the sommaire signature. In the 1933 II volume, the final one of the review, Da Capo prints the editor's note, which had originally appeared in the sommaire signature, as the fourth page of the front matter, which otherwise would have been blank; this is then followed by the one-page sommaires of both the Fall and Winter fascicules, before resuming with the complete, integrated volume. and many kept it as such. Those who placed it into the 1929 II portfolio created a different publication, half of which was now devoted to a survey of new German buildings. There is one last characteristic of the quarterly fascicules to mention, as it bears some importance in sorting out the dates of some of the extraits. Placed in the center of the back cover of each paper portfolio is the emblem for Éditions Albert MorancÉ. From the first issue until the end of 1931 , this consisted of an Egyptian lotus blossom and volute, arranged within a circle, and intertwined with serifed letters forming the monogram eam. At the start of 1932 , the emblem changed to a more abstract design: a black bull's-eye encircled the words Éditions albert morancÉ , with the monogram eam superimposed in crosshatched, blocky, sansserif letters. This device is an adaptation of the one used in 1930 for the back cover of the E.1027 extrait , which will be discussed later on. 2. WEISSENHOF From its earliest years, L'Architecture Vivante published the work of German architects, an inclusiveness not always shared by other French publications between the wars. Besides occasional buildings shown early on, six entire issues of the review were dedicated to German work, beginning with the Spring and Summer 1928 issues, both of which covered the 1927 Weissenhof Siedlung exposition in Stuttgart . They included articles by Jean Badovici , Sigfried Giedion , and two by Le Corbusier, as well as fifty plates illustrating houses by all sixteen participating architects, with the exception of Victor Bourgeois. In addition to combining the two issues into the first volume for 1928 , Badovici and Morancé also published an identical work outside of the review: La cité-jardin du Weissenhof à Stuttgart , which beneath its title is designated an "extrait de l'.Architecture Vivante." It cost 80 francs , while the combined volume sold for 75 francs . 9 Its portfolio cover follows the look of the review, using the same Didot typeface and symmetrical typographic layout, and the same tan paper covering the boards (fig. 2.1, plate 2). Inside, each page appears exactly as it would for a combined volume, with a l''Architecture Vivante title page showing the printemps/été 1928 date, as does the table of contents. 10 While thematic issues of the review had appeared as early as 1925 , this was the first to be sold outside of its run.

One, in a private collection, is missing the first 32 pages of text, so that it cannot be verified that the title page has remained unchanged from the review. The other, at the Université Laval, in Montreal, is complete inside, but is missing its portfolio cover. While this means that it might not be an extrait , but an ordinary volume of the review, the online catalog entry stated that its title, La Cité-Jardin du Weissenhof à Stuttgart , was taken from its cover. Following my query, this note has been removed and replaced by one concerning the absence of the portfolio cover. Nonetheless, I believe that the earlier note came from the original card catalog, and is accurate. continued to sell this volume until early 1932 , when it was repackaged as the first volume of the series l'Architecture Vivante en Allemagne , to which we will return. 11 3. LE CORBUSIER ET P. J EANNERET In the Winter of 1928 , Badovici announced the next l'Architecture Vivante publication outside of the review, to be dedicated to the " oeuvres récentes" of Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret . 12 It was promised to be of the same "luxurious form dear to our review," and cost 100 francs , although there would be no additional cost to the subscriber (who would have paid 135 francs for both 1929 volumes). The book was issued in the Summer of 1929 , 13 and its contents exactly reproduced that of the printemps – ÉtÉ double issue of that year. It did not replace this issue – subscribers still received the double fascicule with its paper cover, and a separate standard cardboard cover if one had been ordered – but merely reproduced it as a stand-alone work for non-subscribers, housed in a new portfolio cover designed by Le Corbusier (fig. 3.3, plate 3). On November 8, 1928 , Le Corbusier had written to Badovici describing the layout of the cover, proposing that it be printed on gray paper glued to a cardboard cover, with a site plan of the Mundaneum project in white. 14 Printed across it would be "Le Corbusier et P. Jeanneret' in red, and "oeuvres récentes de," "L'Architecture Vivante ," and "MorancéÉditeur ' in black. Eventually the color changed to blue, the Morancé name was eliminated, and the " oeuvres récentes" " dropped from the title altogether. 15 This design forms the model for the next four covers in this series. On the spine, in white, serifed lettering, read le corbusier et p. Jeanneret. The only change from the review within the publication was a recasting of the first signature: the title page no longer read "L'Architecture Vivante," but now "Le Corbusier et P Jeanneret," and the publisher's page included the notation "extrait de l'Architecture Vivante," indicating its source, but no mention of the date of publication. Since the new book comprised two consecutively numbered fascicules, no change was necessary for the pagination or the table of contents. 11.

Fondation Le Corbusier: C3–12–2. 15. The title was in flux right up to the publication date: on 30 May 1929 , an announcement for the book ran in Bibliographie de la France with the subtitle: Oeuvres nouvelles. Fondation le Corbusier X1–08–122. Morancé must have considered this portfolio a success, for the following year they issued two more in what was now a series, ultimately to be advertised by them as the architects' "oeuvre complète." The first of these two volumes jumped back in time, as l:'Architecture Vivante had also dedicated the Fall 1927 fascicule to Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret. This issue now became Le Corbusier et P Jeanneret: Première série (fig. 3.1). 16 Once again, the first loose signature was reset with the new title, and the publisher's page read "extrait de L'Architecture Vivante;" the remainder of the text, pages 5–40, remained unchanged. But since the table of contents of the original review was issued as part of the Winter 1927 fascicule, and included contents for both the Fall and Winter, it needed to be replaced as well. The new table of contents occupies pages 41 and 42, with the remaining two pages of the added signature blank. The plates retain the original dates from the review, automne mcm xxvii , despite the actual 1930 publication year of the new volume. This volume was apparently also reissued at a later date, as copies exist with both the lotus emblem and the bull's-eye emblem on the rear cover (fig. 3.2). 17 With more publications in the works, the original Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret volume also made a transformation in 1930 . To keep the chronology correct, it now had its cover and title page reset to include the subtitle " deuxième série," and a new spine reading le corbusier et p. jeanneret – ii (fig. 3.4). The third volume of the series, also published in 1930 , 18 reproduced the Spring fascicule of that year (fig. 3.5). Like the "première série" volume, its only internal changes from the quarterly fascicule to autonomous volume were the first and last signatures: the front matter and the table of contents. The new table of contents, incidentally, extends an error originating in the Spring 1930 sommaire and repeated in the Summer 1930 table of contents by leaving out reference to the drawings printed on pages 40 to 48. In the Summer of 1931 , Badovici published his next installment of Le Corbusier's work in l'Architecture Vivante , which was issued simultaneously as the "quatrième séri" of the complete works (fig. 3.6). 19 Since the original formed the second fascicule of the combined volume of the review, the entire page-numbering system needed to be revised, so that the text could begin on page 5, rather than page 17, and the plates could run from 1 to 25, rather than 26–50. Like the "première série," the original copies of this title have a lotus emblem on the rear cover, while others have the bull's-eye emblem, suggesting a later reprinting. 16.

Both copies that I have seen with the bull's-eye emblem on the rear cover have an additional anomaly: the half-title includes the description "première série," which had appeared only on the full title page of the initial publication, 18. See note 16 above. 19. Catalogue Valdras: Livres publiés en France en 1931 ( Paris: Vald. Rasmussen, 1932 ), 274. The fifth volume of the series was published in late 1932 , and reproduces the contents of the Autumn fascicule of that year (fig. 3.7). The publication date is confirmed not only by Valdras, but by an inscription from Le Corbusier to the mayor of Algiers in one of the two copies in the Eisenman Collection at the Beinecke Library, dated December of that year. 20 The rear cover now shows the bull's-eye emblem adopted at the beginning of that year for the review fas- cicules. The replacement of the front matter is the only internal change, as the original review included a table of contents (in addition to the sommaire) for this fascicule only, despite the fact that the same information would be repeated in the combined table of contents issued in the Winter fascicule. Badovici may have included this redundancy in the review in anticipation of its necessity in the extrait. 21 In the sixth volume, we see the first alteration, although minor, to a text as it was transformed from a single issue of the review to an autonomous publica- tion (fig. 3.8). The original fascicule dated from the Winter of 1933 (although it was not issued until early 1934 ), and was the final issue of the review. 22 In the four-page signature that included the sommaire , and which was intended to be discarded, was a note from the editor concerning the closing of l'Architecture Vi- vante. Complementing this was the opening pageof the regular text, an article by Le Corbusier entitled Au revoir à "l'Architecture Vivante." In preparing the extrait, Badovici replaced this page with rendered plans and a photograph of a model of Le Corbusier's project for the headquarters of a Zurich life insurance company. Its publication date is 1934 . 23 The table of contents in the Winter 1933 issue of L'Architecture Vivante had an anomalous numbering system, from page 1 to page 4, rather than the usual custom of continuing the numbers of the text pages. It may have been intended to be placed at the front of the combined text pages, although thiswould have left the four pages of front matter out; in every other volume these were un- numbered, but counted in the overall numbering system. In the extrait , the new table of contents (covering only the one fascicule, and renumbered) is also placed, atypically, at the front. In order to make room for it in the first signature, there is no half-title, and the fourth page is not its usualblank. The reason for this format change is unclear, as two pages remain blank at the end of the final signature 20. Catalogue Valdras: Livres publiés en France en 1932 ( Paris : Vald.

In a copy of the fascicule in my possession, stamped "specimen" throughout, this page remains blank. The copy at the New York Public Library, which has been rebound, leaves the page out entirely, probably because it was blank. 22.

The text pages arerenumbered from 5 to 42, and the plates from 1 to 24 (this issue is one of three that do not have 25 plates). The cover, in brown on a yellow background, seems enough different in layout and typography from the first five that I suspect it was not designed by Le Corbusier . I have seen one copy of this sixth volume with an alternative construction: the portfolio cover is exactly the same, but the contents are exactly as they ap- peared in the Winter 1933 issue of the review (fig. 3.9). There is a sommaire with the l'Architecture Vivante masthead, the editor's note, and an advertisement; Le Corbusier's farewell to the review appears on the first text page, numbered 33; and the table of contents, numbered 1–4, lists items from the Fall 1933 issue as well, although they are not present here. This may have been a transitional state, with a new portfolio cover printed but the contents not yet rearranged to their new state. But, as we will see further on, this kind of mashup occurs with a number of the extraits , and seems to point to a later date. During the late 1930 s, and especially during the Occupation, shortages of paper and other supplies may have led to some creative packaging: surplus copies of the review were out of date as periodicals, but could substitute for the contents of the extraits. Either new covers were printed to enclose the old contents, or the covers themselves were overstock as well. The seventh and final volume of the Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret oeuvre complète did not originate in l'Architecture Vivante. Starting in early 1927 , Morancé began publication of l'Encyclopédie de l'Architecture Moderne , which they typically advertised alongside l'Architecture Vivante , and which was conceived as its comple- ment. Where l'Architecture Vivante was avant-garde, l'Encyclopédie was mainstream; and while l'Architecture Vivante published commentary about and essays by its fea- tured architects, l'Encyclopédie remained strictly documentary, with photographs or renderings on the front side of each loose plate, and line drawings showing plans or elevations on the rear, alongside descriptive text. Like l'Architecture Vi- vante , l'Encyclopédie was published four times a year in paper folders containing twenty-five plates, but all four were intended to be reunited in a single yearly volume, rather than two. 24 When l'Architecture Vivante published its final fascicule in early 1934 , the editor's note directed its readers to its sister publication for continued coverage of modern architecture; this now included the work of a number of architects, Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret among them, whose work had previously not appeared in l'Encyclopédie . The work shown in l'Encyclopédie was not organized in any thematic way; like the early issues of l'Architecture Vivante , each fascicule showed work from a wide variety of architects, with anywhere from a single plate to a series of four or five representing each featured building. From the first fascicule of Tome 24. See advertisement for l'Encyclopédie de l'Architecture Moderne in l'Architecture Vivante no. 14, automne 1926 (in the sommaire signature). The early issues of l'Encyclopédie included a note at the bottom of their sommaires explaining the issuing of the cardboard portfolio cover. VII, published in 1934 , until the second fascicule of Tome X, published in 1937 , l'Encyclopédie de l'Architecture Moderne included twenty-seven plates (out of 350 to- tal) showing buildings and projects by Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret . These plates then formed the basis for the seventh volume of the oeuvre compléte , which we can date to 1937 . 25 The cover design of the seventh volume again breaks from the format of the earlier Le Corbusier titles, and follows instead a layout first used in 1933 for the third volume of Russian work, and again in 1934 for the volume dedicated to hospitals (fig. 3.10, plate 4). In each of these, a photographic image is placed diagonally, at 60°, on the left side of the cover, and wrapping around to the rear (interrupted by the spine). The title, Le Corbusier et P. Jeanneret , is arranged on the same diagonal, while 7 E SÉRUIE remains orthogonally in the lower right. This dynamic arrangement was not unusual among French art publications of the 1920 s and 1930 s, 26 and was probably designed in-house at Éditions Albert Mo- rancé . The background for the cover is red, although I have seen a photograph of a version in green; 27 I have no evidence that the green version was published at another date, or that its contents differ in any way. The first page inside the portfolio, forgoing the usual half-title, is the title page, which follows the format of the series exactly. On its verso is the pub- lisher's page, which here states that the volume is an " extrait de 'l'Encyclopédie de l''Architecture'." The following twelve pages are unique in all of the true extraits , in that they publish a text not found in the original publication from which it is drawn: Les tendances de l'architecture rationaliste en rapport avec la collaboration de la peinture et de la sculpture , a paper Le Corbusier had presented at a conference in Rome in October of 1936 . It had appeared in print, translated into Italian, in the November 1936 issue of Domus , and in French in 1937 in a booklet issued by the Reale Accademia d'Italia. 28 The final two text pages con- tain the table of contents, and are followed by the plates of photographs and drawings, renumbered on the recto from one to twenty-seven, and each with its original documentary text and drawings on the verso. 4. E.1027. MAISON en bord de mer The extrait dedicated to Eileen Gray and Jean Badovici's house E.1027 seems to have caused the greatest confusion regarding its relationship to l'Architecture Vivante. Its full title is E.1027. Maison en bord de mer; it republishes the contents of the Winter 1929 issue of the review, renumbered, and with new front matter and 25.

The new cover, the most sophisticated of all the extrait covers, was probably designed by Eileen Gray . It is based on a rug she designed for the house: the blue band in the center resembles the overall shape of the rug, as well as its color, and the black bull's-eye motif in the upper right hand corner also derives from it. 29 The lettering varies from the blocky, hand-lettered MAISON EN BORD DE MER, to the ALBERT MORANCÉ in the contemporary typeface "Egyptian," and finally the names of the two architects in an elegant, hand-drawn, abstracted italic. On the rear cover is the first appearance of the new EAM emblem, based on the bull's-eye of the front cover (fig. 4.1, plate 5). This extrait was published in 1930 , the year after its original, but it is often not recognized as a separate publication. 30 Both Peter Adam and Caroline Constant, in their excellent studies of Eileen Gray , call this publication a "special issue" of l'Architecture Vivante , with the implication that this was the only format in which t appeared, and that it belonged as such to the regular run of the review; they are perhaps following the lead of Susan Strauss in her entry on Badovici in the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects , who also singles it out as "a special issue," the only one she mentions in her text. 31 Similarly, the Beinecke Library at Yal University, in their recent purchase of Peter Eisenman's collection of avant-garde architectural books and periodicals, did not give his copy of Maison en bord de mer a separate call number and catalog entry, but included it within his mostly com- plete run of l'Architecture Vivante. But the original form exists: it has a l'Architecture Vivante paper cover dated HIVER MCM XXIX; a l'Architecture Vivante title page and table of contents for both the Autumn and Winter issues; and a sommaire for the Winter issue only, declaring it to be the 7 th year, number 26. 32 The phrase "Maison en bord de mer" exists in only one place in the review: as a heading for the list of plates in the table of contents (it also appears in a similar place in the disposable sommaire). That the extrait followed, and was based on, the publication in the review is confirmed by several errors it contains. On two of the text pages, both in the text itself and in its accompanying drawings, there are references to page or plate numbers that have not been corrected, as they have elsewhere, to correspond to the new numbering systems. In another case, a reference to a page number has been changed, but incorrectly identified as a plate number. 33 There is also a curious discrepancy between this extrait , as published, and its appearance in Éditions Albert Morancé advertising for the series. Their 1932 catalog refers to it as Maison en bord de mer: Aménagement rationnel d'un intérieur mod- 29. I would like to thank Caroline Constant for pointing out to me the similarities between the portfolio cover and the rug. 30. Catalogue Valdras: Livres publiés en France en 1930 ( Paris : Vald.

On page 16, a reference was revised to read "pl. 17," but should have read "p. 17." erne, par Eileen Gray et Jean Badovici . 34 The subtitle has been fabricated, appearing nowhere in the extrait itself, and no mention is made of the cryptic name E.1027. Then, in alladvertising from 1932 until 1937 , the extrait was offered under the title Aménagement rationnel d'un intérieur moderne: Villa en bord de mer, par Jean Badovici et Eileen Gray . 35 Three things have changed: the exchange of the title and phan- tom subtitle, the substitution of "villa" for "maison"; and the order of authorship. It is not until the Morancé catalog of 1938 that these are rectified, returning to the description presented in the 1932 catalog. 36 The extrait certainly existed prior to 1932 . This is confirmed by Valdras, but also by the introduction of the bull's-eye EAM device, derived from the E.1027 cover, in the Spring 1932 issue of l'Architecture Vivante. By this date, however, Gray had ended her relationship with Badovici and moved to Castellar, although the two remained friends. Perhaps Badovici hadbowed to Gray's wishes concerning the title and authorship of the extrait , and was later trying to make his preferences known, or even to assert his then sole proprietorship of the house. He might also have foreseen a second printing with his version of the title, butthese changes were never made. A second, later version does exist, with the contents from the original l'Architecture Vivante fascicule, including the sommaire , but with the cover from the extrait (fig. 4.2). I first considered that this might be a later marriage, but I have located six copies with this arrangement, 37 confirming that they were combined by the publisher and not a subsequent owner. The covers of these copies also differ from the 1930 extrait , in that the lettering on the spine is in a sans-serif type- face, which was also used for the spine of the seventh volume of the Le Corbusier and P. Jeanneret series. 38 One of the copies also includes an advertisement for the extraits pasted to the inside cover; it includes a listing for the seventh Le Corbusier volume (but not the later Œuvre plastique) , dating it to 1937 or early 1938 . 39 34.

These appear to have been added as they left the publisher, rather than when they were printed, as they sometimes advertise volumes actually printed at a later datethan the volume in which they appear. 36.

Copies in the Eisenman Collection at the Beinecke Library and the Frances Loeb Library at Harvard University follow this pattern, as does a copy in my own possession. I have verbal confirmation of three other similar copies in private hands as well. The sommaire is absent in half of these copies, which I surmise is the state in which those copies were issued. 38. On the copy at the Frances Loeb Library, the authors' names are omitted from the spine, and the sans-serif typeface is shorter and broader. One other copy has serifed lettering on the spine. 39. One additional arrangement is found in the copy from Eileen Gray's own collection, donated by her biographer, Peter Adam , to the National Museum of Ireland. Here, the bulk of the material is from the original l'Architecture Vivante fascicule: the paper portfolio cover, the som- maire and its ads, most of the text (including the table of contents covering two fascicules), and the plates-but the first twelve pages of text, numbered5–16 instead of 17–28, are from the extrait. The first signature, withthe title page, is missing altogether. Since this originated from Gray herself, I suspect that this was cobbled together for her, and not issued to the public in this form. This copy is not the one shown by Adam in his book with Gray's typewritten annotations; that copy is the fully emended extrait , and is, as far as I can tell, still in Adam's possession. 5. L'ARCHITECTURE RUSSE EN U.R.S.S. The summer 1930 issue of l'Architecture Vivante included an announcement stating that the Fall and Winter fascicules would contain "the most complete record available of contemporary Russian architecture." Both issues would be available in December, and would include articles by Badovici and Le Cor- busier. Like the double issue of Spring/Summer 1929 devoted to Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret , this special issue would not carry any additional cost to subscribers, despite its higher price when offered as a separate publication. 40 Although produced simultaneously, in this instance the two fascicules were not combined in a single cover, but as separate AUTOMNE and HIVER issues. The for- mer included the complete front matter, all text and documentary drawings, a table of contents covering bothissues, plus twenty-five plates; the latter contained plates 26–50 and nothing else. The essay by Le Corbusier never materialized. The special Russian-themed issue parallels the earlier Le Corbusier issue in another aspect aswell: it too had been preceded by earlier fascicules on the same subject-in this case the first halfof the Spring 1926 issue and the entirety of the Winter 1928 issue. In repackaging the 1930 fascicules to join the growing collection of extraits , Morancé avoided the out-of-sequence publication that had occurred in the Corbusier series by publishing two volumes together, withthe 1926 and 1928 material together forming the first volume. Publication was in early 1931 , and the two volumes were initially offered only as a set. 41 The individual portfolio covers, possibly designed by Badovici, inaugurate the design that would formthe basis of ten of the twenty-one extrait titles. A large, hand-drawn, white L'AV fills the width of the yellow cover. Overlapping this, in a curveless lettering reminiscent of De Stijl, in black and running vertically, is the title: L'ARCHITECTURE RUSSE ENURSS. A black square in the lower right hand cor- ner carries the publisher's name; below it a black rectangle and triangle form a large arrow pointing back to the title. Below the arrow isthe volume number: IE SÉRIE or 2 E SÉRIE. The overall effect is that of a handmade version of Bauhaus typography, the arrow particularly reminiscent of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's work of the 1920 s. The rear cover is blank, except for the EAM lotus device. The first of the two volumes is one of the few extraits that do not match the contents of a single parent fascicule, and so constitutes a more original publication than most (fig. 5.1, plate 6). The title page, as is typical, has been changed, and reads L'ARCHITECTURE RUSSE EN U.R.S.S. , and on the publisher's page opposite, EXTRAIT DE L'ARCHITECTURE VIVANTE. There follow ten pages of text and draw- ings, renumbered from the originals. The sole article, Le mouvement constructif russe, 40. L'Architecture Vivante no. 28, été 1930 .

The five original pages of drawings which illustrate the Russian work of both issues are carried over to the extrait , while drawings of an office building by Erich Mendelsohn and illustrations for Badovici's article on the flat roof are removed. The final two pages of the signature comprise the table of contents, which includes a note explaining the sources of the plates to follow, which would otherwise seem incomplete: plates 1–13 are from the Spring 1926 issue, followed by plates 26–50 from the Winter 1928 issue. The second volume, already set up as a complete double issue, needed only a substitution of the front matter, with the new title, in order to make the transition from quarterly review to stand-alone book (fig. 5.3). In the Summer of 1933 , another fascicule of the review was dedicated to Rus- sian work, bringing the total to four and a half. This issue, with forty pages of text and drawings, but only twenty plates, focuses on theaters, in particular the 1930 competition for a new Ukranian State Theater, won by the Vesnin brothers. This issue, too, was republished in the same year, as the third volume of the l'Architecture russe en URSS series. 42 It gained a new title, Salles et spectacles , but otherwise re- mained unchanged in content. New front matter was printed, and the text and plates were all renumbered to begin at one (fig. 5.6, plate 7). The cover for this volume, as mentioned earlier, takes on a new form, with a diagonally placed pho- tograph wrapping around to the rear cover, where the publisher's emblem has now changed to the bull's-eye design, all on the same yellow background as the first two. The lettering for both the series title and the title of this volume appear orthogonally, justified right, in contrast to the dynamic form of the photograph. The first two volumes of the series were reissued, either simultaneously or within the next three years, with new covers matching the layout of the third volume. 43 On the covers of these, with no individual title, the series title regains prominence: I'ARCHITECTURE RUSSE follows the diagonal of the photograph, while URSS is enlarged and given more weight, balancing the bull's-eye emblem when the two covers are seen as a single composition; the interior remains unchanged (figs. 5.2, 5.4). The second volume was also issued in a green cover (fig. 5.5). There is a final variation with the third volume, where again the cover alone changes: the back- ground is now blue, and the typographical elements are rearranged, with SALLES ET SPECTACLES following the angle of the photograph, along with a new subtitle: PROGRAMMES ET SOLUTIONS TECHNIQUES (fig. 5.7, plate 7). 44 42.

These include the sixth volume of the Le Corbusier series, but not the seventh, dating them from 1934 to 1936 . 44. The copy held at the Marquand Library at Princeton University, with the variant blue cover, includes an advertisement for the l'Architecture Vivante series of extraits on the inside cover of the portfolio. It includes all of the titles published, including the seventh Le Corbusier volume, dating it to 1937 or later. 6. F REYSSINET The spring 1931 issue of l'Architecture Vivante was dedicated to the concrete structures of Eugene Freyssinet, with articles by Badovici and Freyssinet, seven pages of drawings, and twenty-five plates. The associated extrait was issued that same year under thetitle Grandes constructions réalisées par E. Freyssinet . 45 The title makes an oblique reference to Badovici's 1927 portfolio, Grandes constructions: Bé- ton armé-acier-verre , issued as part of Morancé's Documents d'Architecture series, and its half-title page even identifies it as " deuxième série." This remains an obscure reference, though, as the earlier publication is never directly mentioned. In Oc- tober of 1931 , the two were advertised together in l'Encyclopédie de l'Architecture, but even there they are not presented as a pair, and the differences in the titles emphasized as much as their similarities. 46 In later advertisements for the extraits, Badovici and Morancé actually include Grandes constructions: Béton armé-acier-verre as part of the l'Architecture Vivante series, but it is listed under a separate heading as the Freyssinet title, with no attempt to link them thematically. 47 The cover follows the original layout of the l'Architecture russe en URSS series, with rust-colored type superimposed on a gray and white background, and a blank rear cover. Inside, the first signature is replaced to reflect the new title, and an additional signature is added to the end to include a new table of contents; otherwise the contents remain unchanged from the original (fig. 6.1, plate 8). Two auction records I have seen list twenty-seven and twenty-eight plates respec- tively, instead of the twenty-five listed in the table of contents and in Morancé's advertising for the portfolio (and the one copy of the volume that I have seen in person); I have been unable to verify the accuracy of these listings. 48 The portfolio was reissued some time later, with the contents more closely following the state of the original review than the extrait of 1931 . In the copy from the Eisenman Collection held at the Beinecke Library, the original som- maire is retained, although the signature with the l'Architecture Vivante title page with its HIVER MCM XXXI date has been removed. The portfolio covers have been reprinted as well in a more sober manner. The typography is in brown on a gray background, in a matter-of-fact layout and a vernacular, sans-serif type- face, giving it a decidedly undesigned look. The paper covering the cardboard covers also appears to be recycled from earlier publications: the clue here is the continued use of the lotus emblem on the rear cover, but we will see later that similar portfolio covers are printed on the backs of undistributed l'Architecture Vivante fascicule covers (fig. 6.2, plate 9). The reuse of materials, both in the contents and for the reprinted covers, and the simplified cover design bothsug- 45. Catalogue Valdras: Livres publiés en France en 1931 ( Paris : Vald.

This is reinforced by the several copies I have seenof these redesigned portfolios with ownership dates, all of which are from the early 1940 s. 7. FRANK LOYD WRIGHT Frank Lloyd Wright: Architecte américain is the only volume of the extraits not listed in Valdras , despite the certainty that it was published within the time period it covers; its dating is therefore the most speculativeof the collection. The work was originally published in the Summer 1930 fascicule of l'Architecture Vivante, three copies of which were sent to Wright on November 17 of that year. 49 On January 9, Wright telegrammed Badovici requesting twenty additional copies, and again eleven days later requesting another thirty. The fifty copies were sent to Wright, along with an invoice, and for the remainder of 1931 Wright and Morancé haggled over the cost, with Wright's office arguing that the use of his drawings and photographs "for free" should entitle him to some type of discount. Morancé and Badovici, with Wright's drawings in hostage, threatened to send a collection agency. That the yearlong discussion concerned individual fascicules of l'Architecture Vivante , and not the extrait , is clear from both the prices quoted by Morancé, and Wright's office referring to them as "magazines." The earli- est references I have found for Frank Lloyd Wright: Architecte américain appear in 1932 , in the bibliography of The Museum of Modern Art's Modern Architecture: International Exhibition , and in Édition Albert Morancé's own catalog of that year, neither of them providing a date other than that of their own publication; the former waspublished in February of 1932 , the latter printed sometime in 1931 . 50 Henry Russell Hitchcock, Jr. , who wrote the nine-page essay on Wright for the MoMA publication, himself owned a copy of the extrait , now in Avery Library at Columbia University. I am placing the publication of the extrait in 1931 : any earlier, and Badovici would have been negotiating with Wright over copies of the extrait rather than the l'Architecture Vivante fascicule; any later and it would not appear in these publications. The design of the cover follows the Russian prototype, with FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT hand-lettered in black and superimposed on a white L'AV and a yellow background. The rear cover has the lotus version of the EAM emblem, further reinforcing the 1931 publication date. Inside, the front matter has been recast to include thenew title, page and plate numbering has been revised, and a new table of contents has been composed to reflect these changes (fig. 7.1, plate 10). 49.

A second, later version exists, with a revised cover design that borrows from various extrait designs. The L'ARCHITECTURE VIVANTE placed vertically in a black band on the right edge originates from the fourth volume of the Le Corbusier and P. Jeanneret series; this device also appears in two titles by Paul Nelson , to be discussed later, from the late 1930 s, and possibly concurrent with this version. A large black rectangle at the bottom is all that remains of the arrow on the original cover (fig. 7.2). The title and publisher's name have been redrawn in a less dynamic arrangement, as with the later cover from the Freyssinet title. The interior, as is the case with other reissues, appears to be made up of overstock of the originating l'Architecture Vivante issue: the page numbers begin at 49 and the plates at 26, and the table of contents is for the Spring/Summer 1930 volume, and so refers to articles, drawings, and plates not included in the book at hand. 51 The first signaturesomewhat corrects this last anomaly by eliminating the half- title, making room for a sommaire , like the one issued with the original fascicule covering only the items to follow. Whether Wright ever obtained a copy of the extrait is not clear. He inscribed a copy of the original version for his friend Walter Agard , but it may have been brought to Taliesin by Agard himself. 52 On 27 September 1946 , Wright wrote to Éditions Albert Morancé asking if they had any copies for sale; the response from Albert Morancé was that they had not had any for several years. 53 8. ALLEMAGNE Walter Gropius and Jean Badovici met during the first half of 1931 , putting together material for an issue of l'Architecture Vivante , which was published in the Autumn of that year. They also discussed an extrait based on this issue, to be titled L'Oeuvre de Walter Gropius. On July 1, Gropius sent Badovici a mockup of the cover, designed by Gropius and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. Its colors were brown, yellow, black, and white, with a photograph of the Bauhaus Dessau building; the typeface was Futura Bold, the same type Moholy-Nagy used for the cover of Gropius's Bauhausbauten Dessau ( bauhausbücher 12) of the previous year. 54 The cover and the title were never used, as Badovici followed the Fall 1931 issue with another on German architects, and combined the two to create his extrait . Now 51. The Canadian Center for Architecture holds copies of both the original and this later version of the extrait. Their copy of the latter follows my description, except that the original table of contents has been removed. It is unclear as to whether this was done by Morancé prior to distribution, or by a subsequent owner. 52. As of April 2015, this copy was offered for sale by Sims Reed Ltd., London. The inscription reads: "To Walter Agard - | from Frank Lloyd Wright | Taliesin -Aug - 193 ?". The last number of the date may be a 5, but is difficult to decipher. Correspondence between Agard and Wright show that Agard was at Taliesin in September 1930 (Wright was not there, however), October 1932 , and April 1933 , none of which appear to correspond to the signing of the book. 53.

Letter from Walter Gropius to Jean Badovici , oijuly 1931 , private collection. The col- ors and typography were discussed in the letter, but the mockup itself, as far as I know, is lost. titled l'Architecture Vivante en Allemagne: troisiéme série , it appeared inearly 1932 ; at the same time, the Stuttgart extrait was repackaged as the first volume of the series, and the Autumn 1929 issue as the second. 55 The covers of these three extraits follow the now standard model, with the iden- tical titles in blue on a beige and white background, the only difference between them being the volume number in the lower right hand corner. The rear covers are blank, with no EAM emblem evident as the publications make the transition be- tween the lotus design and the bull's-eye design. The contents of the first volume again reproduce the Spring and Summer 1928 issues, with no changes necessary in page numbering (fig. 8.1, plate 11). Only the initial signature is replaced to reflect its independence from the review; the new title page now includes La cité- jardin duWeissenhof à Stuttgart as a subtitle. The second volume, from Autumn of 1929 , besides replacingthe first signature, also adds a signature at the end of the text in order to include a table of contents (fig. 8.3). The new title page does not have a subtitle other than the designation deuximé série , although later advertise- ments subtitle it Les maisons metalliques en Allemagne , repeating the title of the sole article in the publication, despite its inaccurate description of the works included. The third volume again reproduces two consecutive issues of the review, Autumn and Winter of 1931 , although these were not as coherently joined in a double issue as the first volume (fig. 8.5). The new front matter again forgoes a subtitle, but the volume was later advertised as Walter Gropius et le jeune école allemande. The first fascicule included here is devoted entirely to Gropius, and he is included in the second as well; the "Young German School" that fills out the second fascicule consists of Robert Vorhoelzer , Karl Otto and Jan Ruhtenberg , Lily Reich , Lud- wig Mies van der Rohe , Hans and Wassili Luckhardt , and Marcel Breuer. In the winter of 1932 , after the first three extraits were published, the final German-themed fascicule of l'Architecture Vivante was issued, with its attendant extrait following in early 1933 . 56 A new portfolio cover was not printed for the extrait. Instead, a small label reading 4 E SERIE was placed over the volume num- ber of earlier covers still in stock. (fig. 8.7). 57 Inside, a new first signature was added, with the title reading l'Architecture Vivante en Allemagne , and as a subtitle: Erich Mendelsohn. The text, which ran from page 33 to 48 in the review, did not get renumbered, as was the usual practice for the extraits made from Summer or Winter issues, despite the fact that the table of contents on the final two pages were entirely recast to remove references to the contents of the Autumn fascicule. The plates, as well, remained numbered from 26 to 50. This anomaly presents the appearance of an incomplete publication, and it is not clear if this was an oversight or a deliberate cost-saving expedient. 58 55.

The copy held at the Architecture Library at City College of New York retains just a remnant of the label, with 3 E SERIÈ clearly visible below. 58. The original catalog entry (now emended) for the copy in the Eisenman Collection at the Beinecke Library, for instance, listed thecontents as "imperfect: p. 5–33 wanting." The copy is, in fact, complete as issued. All four volumes of l'Architecture Vivante en Allemagne were reissued at a later date, with new portfolio covers in the straightforward style of the reissued Freys- sinet extrait. The materials used for the covers are the undistributed ['Architecture Vivante volume covers from 1932 and 1933 , turned over and printed on the re- verse, the impression of the letterpress printing creating a raised ghost of the original title. The rear covers typically have the bull's -eye emblem, although some have the lotus design printed on paper mismatched from the cover - in other words, recycled as well (figs. 8.2, 8.4, 8.6, 8.8; plate 12). In a copy held by the Getty Research Institute Library, blank pages on the inside faces of the cardboard covers (where ads for otherMorancé titles are typically found) turn out to be advertisement sheets for Schindler elevators, pasted face down. Once again the poverty of materials points to publication during the Occupation, with additional corroboration from ownership signatures: Gordon Bunshaft bought all four volumes, now at Avery Library, on 20 February 1945 . In the first three volumes of this reissue, the contents are unchanged from the earlier extraits , with their revised title pages and, in the case of the second volume, table of contents. For the fourth volume, I have seen two copies where this is also true. 59 Two others I have seen have no front matter present at all, and include the original table of contents for both the Autumn and Winter issues of the review; another has this table of contents excised as well. 9. HOLLANDE Following the initial three volumes of German work, Badovici and Morancé again returned to back issues of the review to assemble an extrait dedicated to Dutch architecture. Like the first Russian volume, it drew on two separate fasci- cules for its contents, combining them neatly into a new entity, ['Architecture Vivante en Hollande: Legroup "De Stijl" et l'École d'Amsterdam , published in early 1932 . 60 The cover matches the design for the Russian and German extraits , with green lettering on a gray and white background; the rear has no publisher's emblem. When the second volume of the series was issued the following year, a paper slip reading IE serie was pasted onto the upper right hand corner of the unsold copies (fig. 9.1, plate 13). Inside, a new signature at the front indicates the new title in full, followed by the three articlesfrom the Autumn 1925 fascicule, running twenty pages. Two articles from the Summer 1926 fascicule follow, and since the Spring issue of that year had run twenty pages, there was no need for renumbering. The second article from the Summer issue, an abridged version of Adolf Loos's Ornamente et crime , is kept despite its tangential subject matter, perhaps only to save the effort of reprinting its signature. The final two pages of this signature, which 59. At the Getty Research Library and the Frances Loeb Library. 60. Catalogue Valdras: Livres publiés en France en 1932 ( Paris: Vald.

A new fourépage signature, unpaginated, with a revised table of contents, is added in its place. In the copy held at the Museum of Modern Art Library, the original l'Architecture Vivante front matter, and the sommaire and its advertisements as well, are also present. The plates are numbered 1–50, and dated with their respective fascicules, with no need for revision. In the Spring of 1933 , a full issue of the review was dedicated to Dutch ar- chitecture, and it appeared as an extrait the same year. 61 The cover is identical to the first volume, with a paper slip reading 2 E SéRIE pasted to the lower right corner (fig. 9.3). The new front matter also identifies this as the deuxième série (the first volume does not state première série) on the title page. No other subtitle exists, although in later advertisements it appears as Les architectes formalistes. The text and plates follow the original numbering sequence, and, at least in the sole copy I was able to see, no table of contents was supplied. 62 A later version of the series exists, with covers matching the typography of the later Allemagne series, this time printed in green, but similarly printed on the reverse sides of unused l'Architecture Vivante portfolio covers. Both copies I have located of the first volume are comprised solely of material from the Summer 1926 review, including its sommaire; it appears tohave been sold this way, lacking the Autumn 1925 material (fig. 9.2). A copy of the second volume is at Avery Li- brary: the contents match the original review, with the l'Architecture Vivante front matter, and no table of contents (fig. 9.4). 10. TONY GARNIER Although most bibliographies date the publication of l'Oeuvre de Tony Garnier as 1938 , Valdras confirms that the correct date is 1932 . 63 The 1938 date seems to originate with Giulia Veronesi's small monograph on Garnier produced shortly after the architect's death in 1948 - a book plagued with errors of identity and dating - and is then repeated in almost all subsequent works on Garnier. 64 The material was first published in the Spring/Summer 1932 issue of l'Architecture Vivante , a double issue with the combined dates on the fascicule cover.

Other errors in this pub- lication include the misidentification of two photographs as belonging to Garnier's first villa at St. Rambert. tents derive largely from two sources: Une cité industrielle , from 1917 , and Les grands travaux de la ville de Lyon , from the early 1920 s. The reproduction of im- ages from the first edition of Une cité industrielle suggests that its second edition, also published in 1932 , was not yet in production. For the latter publication, the images were reproduced again from the original drawings, often cropped to include a slightly larger area of the originals than in the first edition. This is most noticeable in plate 32, an interior perspective of La grand piscine , where a significant expansion of the view occurs in the second edition; the image shown by Morancé (on plate 14) is clearly from the earlier printing. It is possible that Badovici's renewed interest in Garnier led the publisher Charles Massin to bring out the second edition. As a double issue of the review, very little work was required to prepare the extrait: a new signature at the front replacing the l'Architecture Vivante title with that of the extrait , and a new portfolio cover. The latter was based graphically on the fourth volume of the Le Corbusier and P. Jeanneret series. Although volume five of that series, with a different cover layout, had appeared in 1931 , the back- ground urban plan of the earlier cover must have seemed a more appropriate model for the Garnier cover. It shows the Quartier des écoles , based on plate 34 of Une cité industrielle and reproduced by Badovici on page 16 (fig. 10.1, plate 14). The rear cover includes the EAM bull's-eye emblem, as does the original fascicule cover, the first time this device appears in its final form on both the review and its extrait . 11. HÔPITAUX The penultimate fascicule of l'Architecture Vivante , from Autumn of 1933 , was the only single-theme issue that studied a building type rather than a single architect or country. While its theme of hospitals, sanatoria, clinics, and health resorts is perhaps stretched by the inclusion of Richard Neutra's Health House, it allowed Badovici to once again extend hisreach around the globe, while main- taining a cohesion that would allow for reproduction as a separate book.Now copiously titled HÔpitaux: Sanitoria, cliniques, maisons de santé, maisons de retraite: Programmes &amp; solutions techniques de le construction hospitaliére , the extrait , published in 1934 , replaced the initial four page signature, in this case omittingthe half-title but including a two page table of contents. 65 The text, starting on page 5, and the plates, numbered from 1 to 25, remain as originally published. The cover follows the layout of the third Russian volume, with its diagonally placed photograph wrapping around to the rear cover, the rear bull'séeye device balancing the front text in the overall composition. The background is green, matching the variant color of the seventh LeCorbusier volume (fig. 11.1, plate 15). 65. Catalogue Valdras: Livres publiés en France en 1934 ( Paris: Vald.

PERRET In its 1932 catalog, Éditions Albert Morancé announced two new extraits un- der the heading l'Architecture Vivante en France. 66 The first was l'Oeuvre de Tony Gar nier , and the second, the unpublished l'Oeuvre Architecturale d' A. et G. Perret. To my knowledge, this is the only mention anywhere in print of the latter publication. It was to have twenty pages of text and fiftyésix plates, probably drawn from the five issues of the review featuring the Perrets' work: Autumn 1923 , Spring 1924 , Autumn 1924 , Summer 1925 , and Autumn 1926 , as these provide the correct number of plates. The only other Ferret plate published in the review was of the Pavillon de la "Samaritaine" at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs in the Winter 1925 issue. The twenty pages of text corresponds roughly with the nineteen pages devoted to drawings of the Perret projects in the five issues above and to Badovici's article A. et G. Perret from Summer 1925 . As this would leave no room for the typical four-page front matter, perhaps some pages of drawings were to be omitted. BEYOND THE REVIEW Although the review folded at the end of 1933 , Badovici and Morancé were able to keep its legacy alive through the publication of a number of books worthy, in their eyes, of the l'Architecture Vivante name. We have already seen how the seventh volume of the Le Corbusier and P. Jeanneret series entered the series, despite its origins in a related, but separate review. In 1938 , Morancé published Le Corbusier: Œuvre plastique: Peintures et dessins, architecture , edited by Badovici. 67 While the bookis dedicated primarily to painting and graphic art, a few draw- ings and photographs of the Pavillon des Temps Nouveaux are included, and L'ARCHITECTURE VIVANTE appears on the publisher's page, where EXTRAIT DE L'ARCHITECTURE VIVANTE appeared in previous publications. An outer card- board portfolio cover held two inner paper ones; the first contained a text by Badovici as well as drawings, while the second contained thirty-six heliotype plates and four lithographs. Both the cover and the layout were designed by Le Corbusier (fig. 13.1). 68 While Le Corbusier himself included this volume among the "oeuvre complète ' issued by Morancé, 69 the publisher consideredit separate from that series, although still within the l'Architecture Vivante family: both were listed in catalogs and advertisements under the heading l'Architecture Vivante en France. In 1953 , Morancé's son Gaston, now managing the publishing house, suggested to Le Corbusier that a second edition be published, substituting some 66.

Le Corbusier subsequently considered republishing it himself, but no second edition ever emerged. 70 In the late 1930 s, Badovici edited two slight books by the American architect Paul Nelson , who had been living in Paris since attending the École des Beaux Arts in the 1920 s. The first, Deux études de Paul Nelson: Maison de santé et pavillon de chirurgie , presented his unbuilt projects for a small-scale hospital and a surgery pa- vilion in Ismailia, the research for which ultimately led to his major built works: hospitals in Saint-Lô, Dinan, Neuilly, and Arles. The second, La maison suspendue, is dedicated to his extraordinary project for a new type of house. Both books are spiral bound, with orange cardstock covers printed in black with undistinguished typography for the titles and publisher's name, but with L'ARCHITECTURE VI- VANTE printed vertically ina stripe up the right side, exactly as it was placed on the fourth Le Corbusier volume and the Garnier volume (figs. 13.3, 13.4; plate 16). "Biblio" records the dates of the two books as 1938 and 1939 respectively, 71 and these are likely correct. Notices for Deux études appeared in both l'architecture d'aujourd'hui and the Italian magazine Emporium in 1938 , and Nelson sent a copy as a gift to the Museum of Modern Art, where it was received on 10 November 1938 . 72 La maison suspendue includes, on its final page of text, a postscript dated 12 January 1939 , which appears to be conclusive for that book. But earlier dates have also been proposed: Nelson himself, in his 1959 article Design for Tomorrow gives a 1937 publication date for La maison suspendue , and in his entry to the Ameri- can Architects Directory of 1970 liststhe two publications as 1934 and 1937 . 73 In the bibliography of his 1971 interview with Judith Applegate in Perspecta 13/14 , they are listed, presumably by him, as 1936 (a more plausible date for Deux études) and 1937 ; these dates are repeated in most subsequent literature. 74 While Nelson's dates may simply be incorrect, either by error or design, there does remain the possibility of two separate printings of both books. Some copies of Deux études have a variant cover with white printing on blue cardstock; Nelson's own copy was the blue version, suggesting that it might have been the earlier one, but then so was the copy he sent to MoMA (fig. 13.2). 75 The supplemental nature of the dated section of La maison suspendue also suggests an earlier version without it, but I have been unable to locate a copy. 70.

Following the Second World War, Badovici worked as an architect on the reconstruction of several towns near Maubeuge in northeast France. It was there that he met the Greek architect Panos Dzelepy, who had also joined the re- construction, perhaps through the agency of Christian Zervos. Before the war, Dzelepy had been the architect for two complexes designed specifically for the convalescence of children, Voula and Péndély ; these became the subject of Ba- dovici's final book, Villages d'enfants. It was published in late 1948 , in a similar format to the two Nelson titles. 76 It is spiral bound, with black typography on brown cardstock for the covers; the blackstripe proclaiming the L'ARCHITECTURE VIVANTE affiliation runs across the bottom. Inside are 18 pages of text, followed by 66 pages (although numbered to 64) of photographic plates, drawings, and charts (fig. 13.5). In advertising for the extraits throughout the 1930 s, several of Badovici's early Morancé publications were included in the l'Architecture Vivante series. Thosewor- thy of this title were Maisons de rapport de Charles Plumet, La maison d'aujourd'hui: Maisons individuelles , and Grandes constructions: Béton armé-acier-verre; left out, pre- sumably for not being sufficiently avant-garde, were Les intérieurs de Sue et Mare, "Harmonies": Intérieurs de Ruhlmann , and Intérieurs Français 77 No change was made to any of these publications, and their publisher's pages still identifiedthem as part of the Documents d'Architecture series. Albert Morancé died in 1951 , 78 Jean Badovici in 1956 . Two later Morancé titles, Urbanisme and Belgique , now edited by Gaston Morancé , were published in 1956 and 1958 respectively under the l'Architecture Vivante banner, but cannot be considered part of the same series. 79 Badovici also had one additional edito- rial effort with Morancé outside of the l'Architecture Vivante series which bears mentioning. In 1937 , he was a guest editor of the first fascicule of l'Encyclopédie de l'Architecture Moderne , devoted to the Paris Exposition of that year, eventu- ally to be subsumed into Tome XI of that publication. Morancé's extraits from l'Encyclopédie were arranged by building type, which typically meant that they drew from a number of volumes. In this case, though, the complete fascicule was reissued the following year in book form under the title: Architecture de fêtes: Arts et techniques . 80 76.

In Badovici's obituary, the claim is made for 70 l''Architecture Vivante publica- tions under his direction. 81 This is not explained, but can be interpreted as fol lows: 42 fascicules of the review, 21 extraits (including the Le Corbusier volume reprinted from I'Encyclopédie) , 4 new titles following theend of the review (Le Corbusier, Nelson , and Dzelepy) , and 3 titles from the 1920 s appropriated into the series. There are many pieces still missing from the puzzle, most important to me the number of copies printed (and sold) of both the review and the extraits. The extent of their reach, both within and outside of the European architecture community, could then be analyzed: for instance, the relative importance of Badovici's presentation of Le Corbusier's work compared to Willi Boesiger's con- current publications for Verlag Girsberger; 82 or the extent to which Badovici and Gray's E.1027 was known, and whether its relative obscurity in the early histories was partially due to the inaccessibility of its documentation.

While the nature of the sections is self-evident, the essays that accompany the original listing provide useful context for understanding the undertakings and accom- plishments identified here. The first four essays in the book were also published in SB 50 ( 1997 ), 1–212. PUBLICATIONS STUDIES IN BIBLIOGRAPHY ( 1998 ). David L. Vander Meulen , Editor; Elizabeth K.
