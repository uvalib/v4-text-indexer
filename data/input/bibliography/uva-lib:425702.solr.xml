      <field name="heading_text">The Little Gest of Robin Hood : A Note on the Pynson and Lettersnijder Editions by J. C. T. Oates</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pynson's edition of The Little Gest of Robin Hood ( STC 13688), a quarto with 31 lines to the page, survives only in the following fragments: (1) a leaf signed cii, in the University Library, Cambridge (Oates, Catalogue of the Fifteenth-Century Printed Books , &amp;c., no. 4206); (2) 1½ leaves formerly in the possession of Mr. Boies Penrose ( A Selection of Rare Books . . . from the Library of Boies Penrose , &amp;c., p. 29) but now by his gift in the Folger Library ( The Folger Library: A Decade of Growth, 1950-1960 , p. 25); (3) a leaf in the Bodleian Library, Douce fragments f. 51 (3). I shall call these leaves ULC, BPF1, BPF2, and BLO. 1 ULC has been recovered from a binding. It was acquired in September 1888 by Francis Jenkinson (Cambridge University Librarian, 1889-1923) and was presented to the University Library by him on 20th August 1917. It is the fragment registered by Duff, Fifteenth Century English Books , No. 362 ('Private Library') and STC. BPF1,2 have also been taken from a binding. They are doubtless the fragments offered for sale in 1927 by Myers &amp; Co. of London, catalogue 257, item 270. BPF2 is the upper half of the leaf only, containing the first fourteen lines. BLO is very defective. This leaf was known to F. J. Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads , No. 117. He cites it as e but does not attempt to give it a printer or date. Since there are 31 lines to the page, the deficiencies of BPF2 and BLO are easily supplied from Child's text, if allowance is made for a cross-heading, perhaps with a white line above and below it, at the beginning of each 'Fytte'. I give the first and last lines of each page and identify them in Child, using his system of reference (stanza-number with a superior number denoting the line within the stanza). The 'Fyttes' run thus: I, 1-81; II, 82-143; III, 144-204; IV, 205-280; V, 281-316; VI, 317-353; VII, 354-417; VIII, 418-456. ULC recto And euill thyrfte on thy hede . . .} 220 1 -227 3 No force therof saide robyn} verso Agaynst the lawes and ryght} 319 4 -327 2 And went hym on his way} BPF1 recto And Robyn hode wente to grene wode} 327 3 -335 1 Whan she cam in the forest} verso The truthe than tell thou me} 243 2 -250 4 A moche better borowe} BPF2 recto Under the grenewode tree} 312 4 -319 3 [Thou kepest here the kynges enemys]} verso For curtesy can he none} 227 4 -235 2 [Of all this longe day]} BLO recto [With hym] all for to gone} 435 4 -443 2 [It may no better be]} verso [Seuen nyght I gyve] the leve} 443 3 -451 1 [Yet he was begyled, i-wys] It is apparent that BLO is the only leaf on which the verso text follows on correctly from the recto. The text printed on the other leaves extends from 220 1 to 335 1 — a total of 461 lines, to which must be added the headings &amp;c. at the beginning of Fyttes V and VI, making material for 15 pages in all. The contents of these pages may with reasonable certainty be reconstructed thus: 1. 220 1 -227 3 ULC recto 2. 227 4 -235 2 BPF2 verso 3. 235 3 -243 1 4. 243 2 -250 4 BPF1 verso 5. 251 1 -258 3 6. 258 4 -266 2 7. 266 3 -274 1 8. 274 2 -281 3 9. 281 4 -289 2 10. 289 3 -297 1 11. 297 2 -304 4 12. 305 1 -312 3 13. 312 4 -319 3 BPF2 recto 14. 319 4 -327 2 ULC verso 15. 327 3 -335 1 BPF1 recto Since ULC recto is signed c2, it follows that BPF2 verso is c2 verso, and that BPF1 verso is c3 verso. If the book were a quarto in fours, BPF1 recto would be e1, or d1 if it were a quarto in eights, but in fact BPF1 is unsigned. It follows that the book must be a quarto in sixes. Thus BPF2 recto (of which the lower half is missing) is d2 recto, ULC verso is d2 verso, and BPF1 recto is d3 recto: or, to state the facts another way: ULC contains c2 recto backed with d2 verso BPF2 " d2 recto " " c2 verso BPF1 " d3 recto " " c3 verso At this point readers of Studies in Bibliography will not find it necessary (as I did) to fiddle about with folded pieces of paper in order to conclude that, all the formes of c and d being in type at the same time, c (i) has been perfected with d(o) both in the outer sheet of the quire (leaves 1, 2, 5, 6) and in the inner half-sheet (leaves 3, 4). A simple interchange of the heaps before the sheets were perfected accounts for the mistake in the outer sheet. As regards the inner halfsheet the problem is a little more complicated, there being two different ways in which the mistake might have been made: (1) The paper may have been cut before printing began and the half-sheets c3.4 and d3.4 each worked from two two-pages formes. The mistake would then have been caused, as with the outer sheet, by an interchange of the heaps before perfecting. (2) The half-sheets may have been printed by half-sheet imposition ('work and turn'). The mistake would then have arisen by an interchange of the heaps after the sheets had been turned end-to-end before perfecting. Of these two methods of working the half-sheet the first, since it doubles the labour involved, cannot be regarded as anything more than a theoretical possibility. The second is therefore the more likely. Since we know that sigs. c and d each had six leaves, and since c2 recto begins at 220 1 while d3 recto ends at 335 1 , we can now attempt to reconstruct the collation of the whole book. There are 402 lines of text and two cross-headings (for Fyttes VII and VIII) between the beginning of d3 verso (335 2 ) and the beginning of BLO recto (435 4 ). This is material for the thirteen pages d3 verso-e3 verso. BLO therefore becomes e4. The last line of its verso is 451 1 , and only 23 lines of text remain before the poem ends at 456 4 . The last quire therefore seems to have been e 6 , with text ending on e5 recto; we may presume a device on e5 verso, and that e6 was blank. In reconstructing the first two quires it will be necessary to take into account certain features of the other early editions which are extant. There are two editions by De Worde, both in quarto, of which the earlier ( STC 13687, Child's text c ), dated [1500] by Duff, op. cit. , No. 361, survives in two leaves at the Bodleian Library. His later edition ( STC 13689, Child's text b ), which Dr. F. S. Ferguson dates [1506?], survives in the unique copy at the University Library, Cambridge. Its collation is A-D 6 E 8 . It has a short title and a wood-cut, composed of three factotums, on A1 recto and De Worde's device McKerrow No. 19 on E8 verso. The text begins on A1 verso beneath a drop-title which, with the white lines above and below it, occupies the equivalent of nine lines of text. The third extant edition (not in STC , Child's text a ) survives in the unique but imperfect copy in the National Library of Scotland, being the eleventh and last item in the celebrated volume which contains nine unique tracts by Scotland's first printers Walter Chepman and Androw Myllar. Robert Proctor ( Jan van Doesborgh , Bibliographical Society, 1894, p. 24) attributed it to the press of Jan van Doesborch at Antwerp and dated it [1510-1515?]. Nijhoff-Kronenberg ( Nederlandsche Bibliographie , &amp;c., No. 3080) admits the probability of this attribution but points out that there can be no certainty since the Lettersnijder type in which it is printed was used by many Dutch printers. This edition (which I shall call the Lettersnijder edition) is most easily available in Dr. William Beattie's facsimile edition ( The Chepman and Myllar Prints , &amp;c., Edinburgh Bibliographical Society, 1950). I shall try to show at the end of this article that it is a reprint of Pynson's text. For the moment it is only necessary to note that the text begins on the first recto beneath a two-line short title and a reduced copy of the woodcut of the Yeoman which Pynson used in his Canterbury Tales of [1492?] and 1526 (Hodnett No. 1643). We can now return to Pynson's edition. The text preceding c2 recto (stanzas 1-219) with cross-headings for Fyttes II, III, and IV must have occupied about 880 lines, of which 62 are required for c1. The remaining 818 lines are too much for 26 pages (806 lines), unless we suppose that some early pages had more than 31 lines. It seems more likely that they occupied 27 pages (837 lines) and that the gap of some 19 lines was filled either by a lengthy drop-title ornamentally set out, as in De Worde's later edition, or, more probably, by the woodcut of the Yeoman, as in the Lettersnijder edition. These hypothetical calculations cannot, of course, claim to be more than approximately accurate: but 19 lines of Pynson's text measures 90 mm., and the Yeoman cut is 85 mm. in height. In either event we have fourteen leaves (a 8 b 6 , or, less probably, a 6 b 8 ), with the text beginning on the first verso, as in De Worde's later edition; and we may visualize the first recto as carrying a short title and either Pynson's device or the Yeoman woodcut, whether the latter appeared on the verso or not. The complete collation, as here reconstructed, is therefore: a 8 b-e 6 , 32 leaves; a1 recto, title with device or woodcut; a1 verso, text begins beneath woodcut; e5 recto, text ends; e5 verso, device; e6, blank. R. Dickson and J. P. Edmond ( Annals of Scottish Printing , p. 68) thought that the Lettersnijder edition had been printed in Scotland. 'The text of the piece', they wrote, 'is, with trivial variations, the same as that of the 'Lytell Geste of Robyn Hode', printed by Wynkyn de Worde, without date.' They then draw attention to certain features, to which I shall return, of the Lettersnijder edition, but do not comment upon them. That the Lettersnijder woodcut was copied from Pynson's Yeoman was first noticed by Frank Isaac ( English &amp; Scottish Printing Types, 1501-35, 1508-41 , in his discussion of his figs. 92-3). Isaac knew that an edition of the Gest of Robin Hood printed by Pynson survived in the leaf recorded by Duff. 'We must infer,' he continued, 'that whoever printed the present edition had before him this fifteenth-century one or some other from Pynson's press in which the woodcut of the yeoman . . . was made to serve for Robin Hood, while the text, as it easily might, agreed fairly closely with De Worde's.' The lines of text common to both the Lettersnijder edition and Pynson's as they survive, the one imperfect and the other in fragments only, are 314 2 -316 1 and 319 4 -335 1 . A collation of the two editions within these 70 lines shows only three variants of any significance: 319 4 , L lawe / P (and De Worde) lawes ; 327 3 , L (and De Worde) to / P wente to ; 331 1 , L the / P this (De Worde that ). On the other hand L agrees with P on 22 occasions where P differs from De Worde, the most important of them (I give the LP readings first) being: 315 3 , xl.dayes / twelue dayes ; 316 1 , clothes were spredde / clothes spred ; 323 4 , were so (o) noble and gode / noble were and good ; 326 1 , Go nowe home shyref sayde our kynge / Go home thou proud sheryf ; 332 3 , led hym to / lad hym home to ; 332 4 , Bounde bothe fote and hande / I bonde both honde and fote ; 333 2 , rode / a tre ; 333 3 , C.li / hondred pounde ; 334 1 , harde (herde) / lady . Similarly, L differs from P in spelling and capitalisation much less frequently than L and P agree against De Worde. Isaac's inference is thus completely supported by an examination of the two texts. A printer reprinting another man's edition of a popular text may be expected to do so as economically as possible. We have seen that Pynson's edition probably contained 64 pages, including a title-page, a page with his device, and a blank leaf at the end. The collation of the Lettersnijder edition has been reconstructed with, I think, complete certainty (though Dr. Beattie cautiously queries the number of leaves in the last signature) as A 6 b 6 c 4 d 6 e 4 , 26 leaves, of which the surviving copy lacks leaves 6, 7, part of 8, 13-18 and all after 20. It has no titlepage, and the last page must have been fairly full. Its only concession to commercial embellishment is the woodcut which precedes the beginning of the text. It has no white lines above or below the cross-headings for the Fyttes, and the cross-heading for Fytte VI is printed on the same line as the last line of Fytte V. From A5 recto onwards the surviving leaves have 33 lines of type to the page, but by printing two lines of text, with a paragraph-mark between them, in one line of type the printer has got two or three additional lines of text into every page except b4 recto, into which he contrived to get no fewer than eleven additional lines. All these peculiarities are characteristic of a cheap reprint in which economy of paper is more important than appearance. The book's most curious feature, however, is that stanzas 1-12 (with 1½ lines omitted from stanza 2) are printed as prose, beginning beneath the woodcut on the first recto and ending half-way down the first verso. The desire to save paper might reduce a compositor to so desperate a device as he approached the end of his copy, but hardly at its beginning; nor is it likely that at stanza 13 the Lettersnijder compositor received a sudden revelation that what he was setting was verse, not prose. The explanation of this curiosity must surely rather be that in setting the early pages the compositor failed to leave space for the initial woodcut, whether negligently or ignorantly or because the decision to insert it was not taken until after work had begun. The opening stanzas were therefore reset as prose in order to create the necessary space; and there was some consequent adjustment of the succeeding pages. A2 recto has 33 lines of type and 35 lines of text; but A2 verso is unnaturally short, having only 28 lines of type (and 28 lines of text), while the pages of A3, 4 show an unusual regularity in that each of them has 32 lines of type and 32 lines of text. It seems probable that the compositor by his resetting made a little more space than he actually needed; but he could not adjust his type-pages beyond A2 verso since A3, 4 (the inner half-sheet of the quire), being ready for the press before the outer sheet, had already been partly or wholly printed off. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I learn from Mr. J. M. Edelstein of the Library of Congress that Mr. Boies Penrose presented photographs of his fragments to that Library (and also to the British Museum) in 1929. These photographs are ambiguously recorded in Bishop's Checklist as 'photographs, 4ff.' 2 I must add a note of explanation and apology. When I applied for further information about the Folger fragments to Dr. James G. McManaway, he courteously refrained from pointing out in his reply that he had himself (as I afterwards found) published in The Times Literary Supplement of 15th May 1953 a letter asking where the 'Private Library' fragment recorded by Duff might be since 'certain puzzling features of this rare book need to be studied more closely'; and he also refrained, even more courteously, from rebuking me for having thus failed to send him the information which he required in order to pursue his own researches. It seems therefore that I have now, with Dr. McManaway's help, followed a trail which I myself unwittingly compelled him to abandon eight years ago.

      <field name="fulltext">For many years critics of Much Ado spoke highly of Benedick and Beatrice, but found little else to praise. Particularly, many of them complained of disunity in the play. In the nineteenth century, theories of stratification began to be advanced in explanation of the supposed defects. 1 In 1923 J. Dover Wilson refined upon these theories and gave them apparent respectability by an elaborate analysis which concluded that the "old play" which was imperfectly blended into the new was "an early play by Shakespeare himself." He concentrated on the bibliographical problems in the quarto, finding in them evidence that the copy had been a theatre prompt copy in which Shakespeare had marked revisions so unclearly that the compositor had frequently become confused. For example, he pointed to sig. G1, which has a narrower tail margin than other pages and contains thirty-nine lines of text instead of the normal thirty-seven; in addition, a total of seven verses are compressed into five lines of prose. Obviously, the compositor was forced by some factor to make unexpected adjustments in the page. 2 Only very recently have critics found a unified theme in Much Ado , 3 and as late as 1948 G. B. Harrison spoke favorably of the stratification theory in an edition which has been used by thousands of undergraduates. 4 Similarly, though Wilson's position has been convincingly disputed by Sir Walter Greg, Sir Edmund Chambers, and others, 5 they have not offered positive refutation of all his bibliographical arguments. Only limited scientific work has been done on the quarto. Greg proved that the copy for the play had been Shakespeare's foul papers, not a theatre prompt copy ( loc. cit. ). And W. Craig Ferguson, arguing from the absence of stops after speech prefixes and from other typographical practices, has disproved an old theory of multiple compositors. 6 I have applied to this quarto the scientific bibliographical methods illustrated by the work of Charlton Hinman on the Shakespeare First Folio and of George W. Williams and Robert K. Turner, Jr., on other Renaissance quartos. 7 These scholars have repeatedly disproved the old belief that Renaissance compositors invariably set the pages of their copy seriatim. Using their methods I intend to prove that the Much Ado quarto must be added to the growing list of quartos known to have been cast off and composed by formes. This knowledge will let us answer with relative certainty a number of the bibliographical questions raised by Wilson and not specifically answered by others. Thus may we finally lay to rest the theory of stratification. 8 The quarto of Much Ado was printed in 1600 by V. S. (probably Valentine Sims) as part of the same job with 2 Henry IV . 9 It collates A-I 4 [A1] is the title-page, and [A1 v ] is blank. Through sheet G two skeletons were used: Skeleton I imposed A(i), B(i), C(o), D(o), E(o), F(o), G(i); Skeleton II imposed A(o), B(o), C(i), D(i), E(i), F(i), G(o). The precedence of A(i) is proved by three italic types ( B 1 , B 2 , d 1 ) from that forme, which are then divided between the formes of B. 10 The running-titles would suggest that B (i) was also precedent; but two italic types ( B 1 , B 2 ) from B (o) which are divided between the formes of C prove the precedence of B (o). Though there is no indication of the cause for delay, or explanation of what the press was doing during the delay, there seems to be no alternative but to assume that the compositor stopped working after A long enough for both skeletons to be available when B (o) was imposed. By chance the skeleton which had imposed A (i) was used for B (o). Such evidence as there is substantiates the running-title evidence for the precedence of formes in sheets C through G. In these sheets the following formes were precedent: C(i), D(i), E(i), F(i), and G(o). No type evidence (save the doubtful e 6 ) confirms the order for C, but almost certain proof of the precedence of C(i) lies in the fact that a word is divided between C4 and C4 v (aſſu-/rance). If the copy was cast off, it is inconceivable that allowance for a divided word would have been made, especially in a prose passage. Thus, the division of a word between formes is proof either that the pages were composed seriatim or that the forme containing the first part of the divided word was composed first, with the compositor re-marking his copy for the other forme. That Much Ado was composed by formes will be abundantly clear later. It is already indicated by the types ( B 1 , B 2 , d 1 ) which appear in two adjacent sheets: under seriatim composition it would be very rare to find, as we find several times in this quarto, on the first or second page of a second sheet a type from either forme of a first sheet. Hence, the word divided between C4 and C4 v proves that C(i) was precedent. Another word divided between D2 and D2 v ( Bene-/dicke ) confirms the precedence of D(i). A type ( B 3 ) used in both C(o) and D(o) further substantiates this order: since C(i) was precedent, a type from C(o) would not have been available for the precedent forme of D. By the same token, a type ( B 3 ) which is used in both D(o) and E(o) confirms the running-title evidence for the precedence of E(i). For F I have found no confirming type evidence. But if F(i) was precedent, as the running-titles suggest, then there is confirming type evidence for the precedence of G(o): namely, a type ( B 2 ) used in both F(o) and G(i). After G there was another delay in the pressroom, as shown by the running-titles of H and I. For those two sheets new running-titles were composed: Skeleton III imposed H(i), I(i); Skeleton IV imposed H(o), I(o). Some of the types in these two skeletons came from the old skeletons: SKELETON III SKELETON IV H1 v used the running-title from G4 v ; H1 used the running-title from G2; H2 used the running-title from G4; H2 v apparently used all new types; H3 v used at least some types from G1 v ; H3 apparently used all new types (though the N may be that from G1); H4 used types from both G3 and G1 (some are questionable, but some types from both pages are clear). H4 v used some types from G4 v ( M, h ); some others seem to be new. Thus, each of the new skeletons used running-title types from both of the old skeletons. Both formes of G must have been wrought off before either forme of H was imposed. Type evidence shows that both formes of G were wrought off before either forme of H was composed: H(i) was composed before H(o), for types (I 3 , m 1 , n 1 ) from H(i) are divided between the formes of I. But a type ( B 2 ) from the non-precedent G(i) appears in H(i), on sig. H2, and this could not have happened if G(i) were in type when the compositor was working on H(i). The delay after G was evidently not the fault of the pressmen. While they were working on G(o), the compositor was certainly setting G(i), but what he was doing after that can only be conjectured. The breakdown of the skeletons which necessitated the resetting of the running-titles indicates that the letterpress was removed from the loosened formes and that the running-titles then lay unused for a time. Removal of the letterpress implies distribution of the type, but I have found no types from G(o) in H(i). Distribution of the type implies an expected continuation of composition, but as we have seen the composition of H did not proceed. I strongly suspect that while the pressmen were working on G(i) the compositor was working on some extra job—probably a small, one-sheet job which was wanted quickly—on which he used the type which he had distributed from G(o). In anticipation of his return to the Much Ado quarto, he laid Skeleton II aside for re-use, but during the ensuing interval it got jostled about and some of its type misplaced. If the extra job required two formes, perhaps the process was repeated with Skeleton I and the type from G(i). In any case, he sooner or later returned to H(i) of the Much Ado quarto, presumably while the pressmen were working on the (conjectured) extra job. After it was composed, he salvaged what he could from the intact running-titles of both of the old skeletons: Notice that he tended to transfer to Skeleton III, which imposed H(i), pairs of running-titles from the old skeletons (those from G1 v -G4 going to H2-H3 v , and those from G3-G4 v going to H1 v -H4), though one running-title in each pair had to be patched up with some new type. Notice also that it is only in the skeleton for the non-precedent H(o) that we get some running-titles which required all new types: the compositor had apparently salvaged all he could in the earlier forme and in the first page of H(o). Some of this is conjectural, but there is a certain amount of circumstantial evidence to give it credence. If there was an emergency extra job, one wonders what it was. The answer may lie in the 2 Henry IV quarto. Briefly to review the well-known facts, this quarto survives in two issues of which the first (Q a ) lacks a scene (III.1). At some time after the entire first issue had been printed off, the same compositor who had set it added the missing scene as part of a six-leaf gathering (E) in the second issue (Q b ): cancelling E3-4 of Q a , he substituted four leaves, E3-6, newly composed, in several ways stretching his copy to fill the four leaves. The reason for the omission from Q a and the length of time between the completion of Q a and the composition of E3-6 (Q b ) have been subjects of much controversy, and a thorough exploration of these questions is beyond the scope of the present study. 11 But it is quite possible that the omission of the scene was discovered while Sims' workers were still printing Much Ado ; and the discovery might be just the sort of emergency which would cause them to stop work on what they were doing. According to the theory as described above, the types from G(o) of Much Ado were distributed after G(i) was composed. I have found one of these G(o) types in the added pages of 2 Henry IV Q b : I 1 on E5 v , l. 28 (Iohn). Presumably the types from G(i) were distributed when they became available. I have found two types from G(i) of Much Ado in Henry Q b : m 2 on E4 v , l. 4 (mountaines), and T1 on E3, l. 15 (The). 12 I have found many other types which appear in both quartos, but it is very interesting that I would find in this one added forme three types from sheet G of Much Ado —and that none of the three reappear in the precedent forme of H: I 1 reappears in H(o), T 1 in I(i), and m 2 in I(o). All these reappearances are possible if we assume that the types from 2 Henry IV Q b were distributed immediately after impression, as they probably would be, for use in Much Ado . Of additional interest is the fact that when the compositor came to reconstruct some of the running-titles for the Much Ado quarto, he used at least one of the types which had printed the running-titles in Henry Q b : u in Henry Q b E4, and Much Ado H4 v . This conjectured sequence of events is based on the assumption that 2 Henry IV Q a was printed before Much Ado , and that is the order which Greg assumed from the appearance of the two title-pages ( Bibliography, loc. cit. ). Now, the fact that the two issues of the Henry quarto survive in approximately equal numbers made Shaaber (and others) assume logically that about half of the run was issued as Q a , the other half as Q b : one might ask, then, why so many copies of an imperfect book would have been distributed if the imperfection was discovered even before its companion volume was completed. Several answers are possible. Though these two quartos are companion volumes, it is very likely that the sheets of the earlier volume were delivered to the publishers (Wise and Aspley) as soon as it was completed: after all, there might be some buyers for that first volume. If it took Sims' workmen a week or more to print the first seven sheets of Much Ado , the copies of the Henry quarto could have been in the booksellers' stalls for at least a few days (depending on how long was required for its sheets to be made into books), and quite a number of copies could have been sold. These could hardly be recalled when the error was discovered—even if the publishers wanted to recall them. An alternative answer implies some cynicism in the publishers (or in Sims, depending on who was responsible for the original omission), who could save the cost of several hundred sheets of paper by not making perfect the whole run of the first issue, but perhaps rectifying only those copies not yet stabbed, where cancellation would be the easier. At least the question does not present an insurmountable hurdle to the theory. Theory it remains, however, and I do not insist on it. But I do insist—to return to the analysis of the Much Ado quarto—that a delay after G has been proved and, more important for our purposes, that the order of composition through H is as I have outlined. Finally, if H(i) was precedent, the running-titles indicate the precedence of I(i), and I have no type evidence to confirm or dispute the indication. Two factors make very difficult the determination of the precise times of distribution. Although I have identified almost half a hundred types used almost 140 times in this book, and although several italic types occur in adjacent sheets, through sheet G I have found no roman type which reappears earlier than two sheets after a given use. There is one exception: e 6 occurs in B(i), C(o), and D(o), but the identification is questionable. Apparently the compositor held more roman types relative to need than italics: no roman type occurs more than four times in the quarto, and most occur less often; on the other hand, two italic B 's occur in six of the nine sheets and another in five. Even so, if the roman letter were distributed at the same time as the italic, we could expect at least several times to find a roman letter used in two adjacent sheets. That we do not suggests that the formes (through G) were at least sometimes distributed in two stages: the italic letter as soon as they became available, the roman later. Perhaps another eye might identify more roman types than I have found. But in any case the following patterns of reappearances of roman types (excluding e 6 ) demonstrate the difficulty of using them to determine times of distribution: A types are not found in B, but both A(i) and A(o) types are found in the precedent C(i): e 3 , h 1 , I 2 , ſh 1 , ſt 1 (see the type chart); B types are not found in C, but both B(i) and B(o) types are found in both formes of D: e 1 , e 4 , m 2 , n 2 , q 1 , ſh 2 ; C types are not found in D, but both C(i) and C(o) types are found in both formes of E: b 1 , e 3 , h 2 , I 2 , n 1 , s 1 . D(o) types are not found in E, but are found in both formes of F: e 4 , n 2 , ſh 2 , w 2 . But I have no D(i) types before G: e 1 , f 1 , m 2 , ſ 1 ; E types are not found in F. E(o) types are found in G(o) but not in G(i): I 1 , ſſ 1 . E(i) type is found in G(i) but not in G(o): T 1 . I omit mention of the later sheets because the delay after G renders conclusions about the distribution of F and G roman types uncertain; and we have already seen that H(i) was distributed before composition of the next sheet. The other factor which complicates our problem is the pattern of substitution of one kind of type for another. One of these involved the use of VV in place of W. 13 The following chart shows the number of W's (to the left of the slash) and the number of substituted VV's (to the right of the slash) in the text on each page in G: G1 G2 v G3 G4 v Total G1 v G2 G3 v G4 Total 8/0 2/0 3/2 1/1 14/3 3/0 5/0 1/0 3/3 12/3. VV's do not occur in the other formes, which use W's in the following numbers: A(i) 4, A(o) 3; B(o) 14, B(i) 12; C(i) 6, C(o) 3; D(i) 6, D(o) 8; E(i) 10, E(o) 11; F(i) 10, F(o) 10; H(i) 8, H(o) 11; I(i) 10, I(o) 9. Thus, the VV's are used where the demand for "W's" is greatest, no doubt where the W's ran low. Yet the substituted types do not occur in a group unmixed with normal ones. The last two "W's" on G3 are VV's, as is the first on G4 v ; from somewhere the compositor got another W for the last page of G(o). He could, of course, have found it lying on the floor. He could have got it by distributing an earlier forme: clearly the supply was replenished before G(i) was composed. (The only type evidence of distribution of the roman letter is that E[o] was distributed before G1 was composed [see I 1 and ſſ 1 in the type chart] and E[i] was distributed before G2 was composed [see T 1 ].) But I suspect that the distribution occurred between formes and that the mixed pattern of W's and VV's is due to a curious practice of the compositor. Note that on G4 the first, second, and fourth "W's" are W's; the third, fifth, and sixth VV's. Apparently the compositor did not wait until complete exhaustion of his supply of a letter to begin using substitutes. This is a curious kind of aesthetics, but no other explanation suffices for the pattern of the far more extensive substitutions of roman B's in speech prefixes and stage directions, which were normally set in italic. The play has an exceptionally large number of characters whose speechprefix and stage-direction identifications begin with B: Beatrice, Benedick, Balthaser, Bastard (John), Brother (Antonio), Boy , and Borachio —and of course Benedick and Beatrice are identified often. In view of the previously demonstrated shortage of italic B' s, it is not surprising that we find frequent substitutions of roman B's in speech prefixes and stage directions. They occur in five of the nine sheets, on seventeen of seventy pages. Fourteen pages contain both roman and italic "B's"; on nine of them one or more italic B 's appear after the first roman B. Foul cases cannot explain the mixtures, for the roman letter appear with too much system to be explained thus. G3 is an extreme example of the interspersing: on that page, which contains more "B's" altogether and more substituted roman B's than any other page, twenty-three "B's" are arranged two roman, three italic, four roman, two italic, six roman, six italic. Although intra-page distribution might explain the last six B 's (see below), it does not explain the earlier mixture. While extreme, this page differs from several others only in degree: for example, C1 v has five italic B 's, one roman B, then two more italic; C2 continues with three italic, but then there are two roman; the only roman B out of six "B's" on I3 v is the second one; etc. I think the compositor's desire (however half-hearted) for a balanced use of the substitute fount whenever he saw that substitution would be necessary has been demonstrated. The first roman substitutions occur in B(o). Twenty-one italic B 's were used in A(i), twenty more in A(o). We know that the compositor replenished his supply of italic letter from A(i) before composing B1 (see B 1 in the type chart). Even so, he ran short. The italic and roman "B's" in speech prefixes and stage directions of B(o) occur in the following pattern: 14 B1 B2 v B3 B4 v Total 6/0 6/0 6/1 10/6 28/7. The sixteen italic B 's on B3 and B4 v are consecutive, and the lone roman B on B3 cannot be certainly explained. Perhaps the compositor had distributed only part of the italic types from A(i) before composing B1 (when he knew that he would need some B 's for the new forme); then, after running out of B 's on B3 he finished the distribution. At least we know that a distribution had occurred before B4 v was composed (see B 2 ): thus, we know that the substitutions were not dictated by composition in the order B4 v , B3, followed by distribution. In any case, I infer from these figures that the compositor began the quarto with something like fifty B 's in his tray. 15 Whenever in succeeding formes we find nearly fifty B 's in type, we can expect to find roman B's in numbers roughly sufficient to fulfill requirements in those formes. Before composing B(i), the compositor must have distributed the twenty B 's from A(o), though I have no type evidence of such distribution. In B(i) he used twelve italic B 's. In C(i) he again substituted roman B's. If he had distributed the twenty-eight B 's from B(o) before beginning C(i), he would have had no need to substitute; and yet he did distribute B(o) before finishing C(i): see B 1 in the type chart. Thus, he must have distributed the italic letter from B(o) after composing C3 v ; hence, we find the following pattern of substitution in C(i): C1 v C2 C3 v Distribute C4 Total 7/1 3/2 0/2 B(o) italic 6/0 16/5. Even with this fresh supply of italic B 's, the previous record of substitution indicates that the compositor would not have had enough to carry him through C(o), which required twenty-nine B 's. He must have obtained some additional B 's during the composition of C(o), probably from B(i). The only type evidence of such distribution is the questionable e 6 ; otherwise I have found no B(i) types before D(i): see e 2 and m 2 . The issue here is confused by the additional substitution of two roman B's in D(i): D1 v D2 D3 v D4 Total 5/0 1/0 6/1 0/1 12/2. The roman B on D3 v is followed by six italic B 's. According to my calculations, the compositor should have had some half-dozen italic B 's left after composing C(o)—assuming that B(i) was distributed during that forme. This is precisely the number of italic B 's which he used in D(i) before having to use the roman B on D3 v . Immediately after using that roman B, he must have distributed some italic letter, probably that from C(i), enabling him to finish the page with italic B 's. Again there is no type evidence of such distribution: I have found no re-use of C(i) types before E2 v . And even this sequence does not explain the lone roman type on D4. It could have been caused by an accident or been part of some press correction. But this single anomalous type does not disturb the findings thus far for the book as a whole. After D(i) the compositor ran into no more difficulty until G(o). C(o) was distributed before the composition of D(o): see B 3 in the type chart. Those twenty-nine italic B 's were more than enough, with further distributions, for the next few formes. D(o) required only six B 's, E(i) sixteen, E(o) twenty, F(i) seventeen (including one for a Latin word in the text), and F(o) ten. Distributions of italic type had occurred as follows: D(i) before or during E(i) (probably, though there is no type evidence of it); D(o) before or during E(o) (see B 3 ); E(i) and E(o) before or during the corresponding formes of F (probably, though I have found no types from these formes before G). F(i) was distributed before or during the composition of G(o): see d 2 . Despite this distribution, the compositor had to use many roman B's in G(o): G1 G2 v G3 G4 v Total 3/1 9/3 11/12 0/1 23/17. I suppose the distribution occurred during composition of G3, after all the roman B's and just before the concluding six italic B 's (see p. oo). The roman B on G4 v is, under this circumstance, as mysterious as that on D4. No roman substitutions were made in G(i), which required seventeen B 's. F(o) was distributed either before composition of G1 v or, more likely, before composition of G3 v : see B 2 . In H(i) I have found a type ( B 2 ) from G(i) but none from G(o); in H(o) I have found types ( B 1 , I 1 , W 2 ) from G(o) but none from G(i). 16 If my conclusion is correct that 2 Henry IV E3-6 (Q b ) or some other extra job was composed after G, and if it was in two formes, then types from G(o) went into the precedent forme of the extra job. After that forme was composed, the types from G(i) presumably were distributed and used in the other forme of the extra job: they certainly were if the extra job was Henry Q b . The compositor then returned to Much Ado H(i), but he apparently made no distribution before composing it; else we would expect to find in that forme types from the (original) G(o). The G(i) type which appears in H(i) is no doubt one that was not used on the extra job. Before composing H(o), he distributed the precedent forme of the extra job and used several of the types from the original G(o): see B 1 , I 1 , W 2 in the type chart. Notice that both roman and italic types were distributed. There was no shortage of B 's in H: H(i) required eleven, H(o) thirteen. (Notice that Henry Q b requires only a few B 's.) The non-precedent forme of the (conjectured) extra job must have been distributed by the time the compositor worked on I(i), and H(i) was distributed by the time he set I3 v (see I 3 ). Yet there were not enough B 's for either forme of I: I1 v I2 I3 v I4 Total I1 I2 v I3 I4 v Total 1/9 14/0 6/1 1/10 22/20 1/5 1/0 4/1 1/2 7/8. If the compositor composed the pages in this order and if he still had his full complement of B 's, then I do not know why the substitutions occur in such numbers or in such a pattern. It would seem that he ran low on B 's on I1 v , replenished his supply (from H[i]?) for I2, but ran low again for the last two pages of I(i). He was still short of B 's in I(o), but may have got some from somewhere before composing I3. I have no evidence that H(o) was ever distributed before the quarto was completed. An alternate explanation is that the compositor set the pages in a different order, perhaps I2 I3 v I4 I1 v I2 v I3 I1 I4 v 14/0 6/1 1/10 1/9 1/0 4/1 1/5 1/2. Such an order makes sense for I(o), but I do not know why it would have been adopted for I(i). If there is some doubt about some of the details of distribution and substitution, there is no doubt whatever that the copy was cast off and the quarto composed by formes. As we have seen, this fact is established by the overwhelming evidence of the types which occur in adjacent sheets and of the many substituted roman B's which, except for sheet I, occur in only one forme per sheet. Seriatim composition cannot explain these phenomena so well as the sequence of composition by formes which I have described—minor discrepancies notwithstanding. The application of this result to the critical problem of whether Much Ado is a stratified play is simply that the bibliographical problem on G1 now seems likely to have been caused immediately by composition-room practices and ultimately by the foul papers which were the copy. Some miscalculations in casting-off are to be expected. All the more is this true of Much Ado , which contains a high percentage of prose: verse is simple to cast off, but accurate estimation of the space which manuscript prose will occupy in print is not so simple, especially if the manuscript has revisions. It has escaped notice, apparently, that G1 is not the only page in the quarto which has more or fewer than the normal thirty-seven lines. A3, B3, C4 v , and E3 contain each only thirty-six lines (not counting, for these or any other pages, the lines which contain non-textual matter: running-titles, signatures, and catchwords): in each case the blank line occurs before a stage direction, whereas stage directions are not normally separated from the context by blank lines. A3 v , B4 v , C2 v , F4, and I2 v have each thirty-eight lines of text, the last one sharing a line with the catchword. 17 Half of the anomalous pages occur in non-precedent formes and suggest that the compositor was adjusting for miscalculations. It might be argued that the compositor did not care whether his pages came out to a consistent length; but the many adjustments in apparently normal pages which I shall discuss below reveal that he went to great pains to make his pages consistent. Aesthetic considerations may at times have dictated a too-long page: the thirty-eighth line on half of the too-long pages is of one word, and nowhere in the quarto did the compositor carry a single-word line onto a new page. But he often carried a single line of a speech onto a new page, and a few of these overruns have only two or three words. In any case, there is little question about three of the long pages with thirty-eight lines: the last line of each is full and argues for a motivation out of necessity rather than aesthetics. Finally, some of the anomalies could have been accidental; but the number of adjustments discussed in succeeding paragraphs argues for deliberation by the compositor. The compositor saved one line each on A4, C1, F3, and I2 v by crowding an overrun into the margin above or below the end of a line; scores of other overruns (including several short ones on C1) were printed as separate lines of type. The crowded overrun on C1 involves an entrance; by contrast, many other entrances were printed on separate lines even when there was room for them at the ends of verses. (Some other possibly crowded entrances occur on F2, l. 35, and H2 v , ll. 1-2, both discussed below; and on I2, l. 29.) The crowded overrun on F3 involves an exit. Exits were usually printed in the margins at the ends of lines, but in at least one instance where the exit was too long for the space (C3, l. 29) the entire exit was printed on a separate line. Either C3 was being stretched to fill the page 18 or F3 was being compressed, or both. The crowded overruns on A4 and I2 v involve the text. The crowding on the former page (ll. 4-5) may have been necessary because of a misjudgment in the handling of the stage direction at l. 3: here " Exeunt. Manent Benedicke &amp; Claudio " occupies one line; by contrast, on C1, l. 24 (a crowded page), " exeunt: manet Clau. " is placed in the margin after a line of text. Whatever the case, the different handling of the similar directions on two pages is probably significant. The crowded overrun on I2 v is unquestionably significant, for the page is crowded in other ways: It contains thirty-eight lines. The identifications " Epitaph " (l. 3) and " Song " (l. 13) do not occupy separate lines as the identification " The Song " does on D1. And the epitaph and song are not spaced stanzaically as the earlier song is on D1 v . Compression of other sorts occurs on other pages. On A2 v , the final speech-prefix is not indented as most are; moroever, in the final speech the spacing between words and especially after commas is very tight, and there are almost no final -e 's. On G4 v , l. 6, two brief speeches are set up on the same line, for the only time in Much Ado ; contrast, for example, C2 v , ll. 20-22, and C4 v , ll. 9-10. H2 v , ll. 1-2, presents a striking handling of stage directions. An entrance is marked in the margin rather than in a separate line; the compositor's method elsewhere indicates that the motive was to save space. As it happened, however, an exit was to be marked at the same place, and the marginal entrance occupied the space normally assigned to exits. Faced with this dilemma, the compositor used Dogberry's rule ("an two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind") and placed the exit above the entrance. This order was normal: in every other place in the quarto, exits appear before entrances, whether on the same line or not (e.g., A4, l. 3; B2, ll. 4-5, 27-28). In the present instance, the placing of the exit was unfortunate, for it left Antonio with one line to speak after he had exited. There is no reason to suppose, however, that the compositor shared our concern for precision in such matters: his concern was simply to get his material onto the page, and his material was apparently longer than he had anticipated. Possibly he did not notice that " Bro ." (Antonio), identified in the speech prefix, was one of the unnamed persons who were leaving (" Exeunt amb. "), or he deliberately decided that proper placement was more important for an entrance than for an exit. 19 Several pages show evidence of the stretching of copy to fill a page. B3 v C3 (already discussed in another context), and E1 v run over onto their last lines two to four letters plus a point which would not have needed to be run over. Especially on E1 v there seems to have been deliberate stretching. Spaces between the words of l. 36 are slightly wider than in most similar prose passages (e.g., E3, ll. 28-30); the tightening of these spaces and the elimination of two final - e 's (in "foole" and "appeare") and of one of the p 's in "appeare" would have left room for "is." on l. 36. On C3 the one-word last line ("sute.") could easily have been fitted onto l. 36 by the abbreviation of the speech prefix and the elimination of two superfluous - e 's; the same speech prefix was abbreviated in a speech just above. On the same page l. 26 is spaced out (by an exceptionally unabbreviated speech prefix) so that the speech would run over onto l. 27. On B1 v , l. 1 was spaced out so that "good." would have to go onto l. 2: the speech prefix was not abbreviated as it was elsewhere on the page; four words in l. 1 have unnecessary final - e 's; and the spacing of l. 1 is very wide. D2, ll. 17-18; F1 v ll. 13-14; F2, ll. 10-11; D2 v , ll. 33-34; and E2, ll. 12-13, show similar wide spacing and long spellings apparently designed to allow the overrun of a single word onto a separate line. 20 The fact of compositor adjustment beyond the normal needs of "justification" of lines seems irrefutable, and at different times the adjustments reflect a varying need, either to stretch or to compress the copy. The likeliest explanation is that the compositor wanted to make each page end at a predetermined point and that he could not rely on succeeding pages to compensate for miscalculations. If, say, I (i) was already in type when a miscalculation was discovered on I2 v , the compositor had to adjust for the miscalculation by the end of I3. To be sure, only about half of the adjusted pages are in non-precedent formes; moreover, the adjustments on sig. 4 v of several sheets seem surprising, for presumably there the compositor would have some room for error. In either case, however, it was probably easier to adjust for miscalculations immediately than to face the distasteful alternative of re-marking (or allowing for the mis-marking on) whatever succeeding pages had already been cast off. Some of the adjustments within the same formes seem to offset each other: for example, the shortage on A3 may have been a compensation for (accidental?) compression on A2 v . But even this compensation is a significant adjustment showing carefulness about the amount of copy to go on each page. Thus, the pages of anomalous length and those showing significant adjustments amount to more than a third of the total pages of the quarto. And most of the adjustments were no doubt caused by miscalculations in the casting off of the copy. The causes of the miscalculations were the high percentage of prose and also, no doubt, partly the nature of the copy. Greg's proof that the copy for Much Ado was the author's foul papers makes very likely the conclusion that, if revisions in the copy caused the compositor to miscalculate, they were currente calamo revisions. I would, then, answer Wilson's question "how can the compositor have miscalculated, if the 'copy' was in order?" (p. 98) by saying that the copy was not in perfect order, but for reasons other than Wilson thought. This applies to the most drastic miscalculation on G1 as well as to the others. The bibliographical problems in Much Ado are just that—problems for the bibliographer, not for the critic of Shakespeare's art.

Blakemore Evans, Fredson Bowers, and Robert K. Turner, Jr. Naturally, these scholars must not be held accountable for my conclusions. I am grateful to the University of Illinois Library for permitting me to use its Hinman collating machine. 9 Proved by the types on the title-pages: "Except for the first two lines and different leads, the [title-pages of these two plays were] printed from the same setting of type" (Sir Walter Greg, A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration [1939], no. 168, I, 274). 10 The list of identified types is given at the end of this paper. 11 The above summary is based on James G. McManaway, "The Cancel in the Quarto of 2 Henry IV ," in Studies in Honor of A. H. R. Fairchild , Univ. of Missouri Studies XXI (1946), 69-80. See M. A. Shaaber, New Variorum ed., The Second Part of Henry the Fourth (1940), pp. 464, 472 ff. 12 Because E3-6 were imposed in two formes, the equivalent of one standard gathering, the outer forme includes E3, 4 v , 5, 6 v ; the inner E3 v , 4, 5 v , 6. Thus I 1 was used in MA G(i), Hen. E(i), MA H(o); T 1 in MA G(i), Hen. E(o), MA I(i); m 2 in MA G(i), Hen. E(o), MA I(o). The running-title u discussed below was used in Hen. E(i), MA H(o). If Hen. E3-6 were printed after MA G, and if as seems likely they were cast off and composed by formes, the inner forme may have been precedent; but the evidence is too sketchy for certainty. 13 The relative shortage of W in Sims' cases is indicated by the substitution of 28 VV's for W's in 2 Henry IV Qa, which made heavier demands on the compositor's W's. It should be added that several roman and italic types occur in adjacent sheets of the Henry Q: e.g., b on Cl v , l. 29 (bid), and D4 v , l. 18 (Canibals); B on A2 v , l. 21 ( Bard. ), and B4 v , l. 28 ( Bard. ); e on El v , l. 29 (wh e ele), and F4, l. 17 (Then); and h on B1 v , l.7 (then to), C4, l. 8 (there), and D4 v , l. 35 (what). 14 In all the following charts the figure to the left of the slash represents the normal italic B 's; that to the right represents the substituted roman B's. The figures do not include a few lower-case b 's used for common nouns ( brother, bastard ) where we might expect capitals. Two of these occur in the speech prefix brother on B3, another on B3 v . On I3 v a stage direction spells brother with a lower-case b . When bastard is preceded by the words Iohn the , it has a lower-case b in stage directions on A4 v and B2, a capital B on E2. Some or all of the lower-case b 's may have been substitutions (three of the four b 's used in brother occur in formes having roman substitutions), but I suspect that they were caused by lack of clarify or actual inconsistency in the foul papers which were the copy. That the copy was unclear or inconsistent is indicated by some lower-case p 's in stage-directions marking the entrance of prince (on B4 and D1): there was no shortage of P 's in Sims' cases. 2 Henry IV Q also contains a number of mixtures of lower-case and capital s/S and w/W; but this evidence is ambiguous, for both S and W were inadequate for the needs in that quarto. 15 He had both plain and swash italic B 's. Apparently they were in the same compartment, for they occur in no regular pattern. There must have been about the same number of each kind, for of 300 italic B 's in the quarto, 148 are plain, 152 swash. In the following charts and in the type-chart at the end of the paper I have not distinguished the plain and swash italic B 's. Incidentally, the failure to intermingle the two founts of "B's" in B(o), except for the one B on B3, may have been caused by a failure of the compositor to realize that he would not be able to make it through with his supply of italic B 's; in later formes he was forewarned by his experience in B(o). 16 Although the ſ on H4, l. 3 (ſeale), is very similar to ſ 1 (found on G1), careful comparison under magnification indicates that they are probably slightly different. 17 In addition, D1 v has thirty-five lines of text plus two blank spaces separating the stanzas of Balthaser's song, II.3.73-74, and separating the song from the following speech. The beginning of the song, on D1, has no blank lines before it and no stanzaic separation. (The designation " The Song " might be thought of as occupying the blank line, but cf. I2 v .) The shortage on D1 v may be normal, but evidence presented in n. 18 indicates that the copy was being stretched; at least the spaces show that on D1 v there was no need to compress the copy. I have ignored the shortages on A2 and I4 v , the first and last pages of text. 18 That this was probably the case is indicated by evidence discussed below. I might note here the significance of the wording of the exit on C3: " exit Beatrice ." Since it immediately follows a speech by Beatrice, " exit " alone would have identified her sufficiently, and " exit " alone might have been squeezed into the space following the last line of her speech. But the compositor, having too little copy for his page, placed the exit on a separate line and then, for the sake of appearance, added the name. Compare Dl v , l. 19, and Ilv, l. 10: In both cases a proper name unnecessary for identification was added to fill a long blank space, presumably for the sake of appearance. The former exit is on a separate line, whereas " Exit " alone could have been fitted into the space at the end of Balthaser's speech. (See n. 17.) The latter exit is in the blank space following Margaret's speech, but the last line of that speech is a short overrun and the blank space exceptionally long. 19 My explanation seems much more reasonable (and in keeping with the compositor's methods elsewhere) than Wilson's explanation of these directions (p. 99): that in the postulated older version the quarrel continued, "that Shakespeare in revising made an end of it here in order to shorten the scene, by scribbling 'come brother away' above the line and 'exeunt amb.' in the margin, and that he omitted to erase 'I will be heard' and ' Bro . And shal, or some of vs wil smart for it.'" Perhaps this crowding will also explain the absence of punctuation after "No" in V.1.108. (Folios after the First have an exclamation, and all editions since Capell's have a query.) The required query would have taken up one space and would have called for a space-consuming capital C on the following word—spaces which the compositor could not afford. Notice the additional space-saving in the abbreviated speech prefix (" Leo ."); on the page preceding this one, the whole name was used in speech prefixes. 20 It should be noted, however, that F2 also has an entrance in the margin following a speech (l. 35). Perhaps the compositor stretched ll. 10-11 on this page because he forgot that he had already achieved an extra line on Fl v he then had to re-adjust F2 by crowding the stage direction. 21 I have identified the types from collotype facsmiles of the Huntington Library copy: No. 791 in H. C. Bartlett and A. W. Pollard, Census of Shakespeare's Plays in Quarto 1594-1790 (1939). In the earlier comparison with types used in 2 Henry IV Q b , I used a microfilm of a Huntington Library copy (No. 341 in Bartlett and Pollard's Index ). Because I have not had access to the original quartos, I have eliminated from the listing (and from my deliberations of the bibliographical problems) apparent identities about which I have had reasonable doubt.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">George Wither's Quarrel with the Stationers: An Anonymous Reply to The Schollers Purgatory by Allan Pritchard</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his Transcript of the Registers of the Company of Stationers (IV, 14-20) Arber reprinted substantial extracts from George Wither's attack on the stationers, The Schollers Purgatory (ca. 1624), to illustrate conditions of publishing and bookselling in the earlier seventeenth century, and subsequently other bibliographers, including A. W. Pollard and W. W. Greg, 1 have made use of the pamphlet, although their opinion of its author's reliability has varied. The existence in a manuscript copy, however, of an anonymous contemporary "Letter" in reply to The Schollers Purgatory appears to have been overlooked, and it is here printed for the first time. Its author is evidently not himself one of the stationers, but he claims close familiarity with them, and he undertakes to express their viewpoint. Although he nowhere mentions The Schollers Purgatory by title, his allusion is clearly to that work, or, more accurately, to those limited parts of it which he has seen at the time of writing: "some fewe imperfect sheetes, vizt A. D. E." (fol. 17 r ). The "Letter" must be viewed in the context of the quarrel between Wither and the Company of Stationers, which had been under way for at least a year and a half when it was written. The origin of the dispute was the patent granted the poet, perhaps through the influence of the Earl of Pembroke, by James I, on February 17, 1623. 2 It not only gave Wither the copyright for fifty-one years of his newly completed The Hymnes and Songs of the Church , but it also required the stationers to insert the work henceforth in all bound copies of the Psalms in meter. The Company, which held the profitable monopoly of the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter, showed immediate concern about the second clause. On March 10, it appointed five members to meet Wither. 3 Failing evidently to reach an agreement with the poet satisfactory to themselves, the stationers seem thereafter to have employed every means within their power to oppose the patent. Sometime before November 3, they petitioned the King, 4 with a result of which the "Letter" itself gives the clearest account: the matter was referred to four clergymen "eminent, both in authoritie and for Iudgment" (fol. 18 v ). They had not delivered their verdict at the time the "Letter" was written; nor is there any record that they ever pronounced it. Meanwhile, the stationers turned from King to Parliament, opportunely raising against Wither's patent the cry "monopoly" in a House of Commons engaged in legislating against monopolies. According to the poet, they maintained daily during the session (in 1624): "three or foure of their Instruments, to clamor against me at the Parliament house dore, in so rude a fashion as vvas neuer exampled in any Cause," and "compelled a fevv of the Bookebynders (whose estates much depend on their fauors) to present the high Court of Parliament with diuers vntrue suggestions in the name of fourescore; when as all except 4. or 5. of them, did (as I haue heard) reiect the said information as faulse &amp; rediculous." 5 A copy of this petition which survives 6 leaves little doubt that the bookbinders in fact had genuine enough grievances against the patent, but it also reveals that the booksellers had put some pressure upon them, and had even adopted the practice of sending books "in quiers" to the country for binding, in order to evade attempts at enforcement of the offensive clause. Whether or not as a result of this petition, on May 15, 1624, the House of Commons ordered Wither's patent, with others, to be "brought in." 7 The writer of the "Letter" states that Wither hid to escape a personal summons by Parliament, but, on May 22, the Sergeant's man sent to bring the poet testified to the Commons that while he had been "withstood, and abused by one, at whose House Withers lay: That Withers assisted him, and kept him from Wrong." 8 Parliament does not appear to have taken any further action, and the patent continued to stand. If the stationers succeeded neither in persuading the King to revoke the patent nor in having Parliament condemn it as beyond the just power of the royal prerogative, their control of the book trade gave them a means of resistance which Wither, even with the support of the Privy Council, was unable to fight effectively. In practice, as he complains in The Schollers Purgatory , the booksellers not only declined to bind his Hymnes and Songs with the metrical psalter (a charge which the bookbinders' petition confirms), but they boycotted the work altogether, refusing to supply copies even to those who repeatedly requested them, and they mounted a war of propaganda against it, questioning his qualifications in divinity, attacking his rendering of the Song of Solomon as obscene, and declaring his hymns for Anglican saints' days to be popish (pp. 17-32, 39 ff.). 9 For his part, as a whole series of incidents in his life shows, Wither was not a man to bear grievances quietly. In addition to counter-attacking in The Schollers Purgatory , which is addressed to the Archbishop of Canterbury and Convocation but is clearly intended also for a larger audience, he exercised the right which his patent gave him to search out and confiscate bound copies of the metrical psalter offered for sale contrary to its terms, 10 and on July 12, 1624, he made complaint to the Privy Council against the Company of Stationers. The latter was ordered to conform to the patent, but the fact that the complaint and the order were repeated on January 21, 1627, indicates that it did not do so effectively, although on February 21, 1627, it made a motion of obedience, and in March, 1633, it engaged in some negotiation with Wither. 11 The poet or his assigns continued the fight until 1635, 12 but thereafter he seems to have conceded victory to the stationers, whose strength and solidarity are impressively demonstrated during the whole course of the conflict, despite the relative failure of some of their tactics. Wither not only lost, as he complained, large sums of money which he had expended in printing copies of Hymnes and Songs on the strength of the patent, but he was unable to have any of his works printed in England in a normal fashion for a decade. 13 Belonging to the most heated period of the conflict, The Schollers Purgatory was in part surreptitiously printed by George Wood in 1624. As the writer of the "Letter" suggests, Wither's reasons for employing the "Printer G. W." are easily discovered, for Wood's relations with the Company of Stationers were as strained as the poet's own. Apparently admitted to the Company as a freeman in 1613, Wood was not a master printer, but secretly he persisted in operating presses. 14 Wither had made him one of his assigns for the printing of Hymnes and Songs , 15 and he may be that "Printer in disguise" whom Ben Jonson describes in his satire upon Wither in Time Vindicated (1623) as keeping His presse in a hollow tree, where to conceale him, He workes by glow-worme light, the Moone's too open. 16 Although his hidden presses had already been confiscated several times by officials of the Stationers' Company, Wood was discovered on September 9, 1624, printing The Schollers Purgatory , which was unlicensed, at an unauthorized press near Holborn Bridge. 17 Once more his press was seized; and Wither was summoned by the Court of High Commission to answer a series of charges. The sworn statement which the poet made to this court sheds some light upon the printing of his pamphlet. 18 In it he disclaimed all responsibility for the operation of the press, but declared that he employed Wood to print The Schollers Purgatory "at a certayne price by the sheete," argued that by the regulating decree "the Printer of a booke is . . . excused though he begin to imprint the same before it be authorized soe it be afterwardes allowed . . . before the full imprinteing thereof," and expressed his belief that Wood could make adequate defence of his own activity, "considering that irregularity lately Comon amonge Printers and withall seeing the booke w ch should haue been imprinted tended to the reformacon of such abuses and disorders." In the final part of his statement may be found some clues, perhaps, as to the reason why the writer of the "Letter" had seen only certain sheets of The Schollers Purgatory : As for the number of the bookes he [Wither] sayth that he determined to ymprint 3000 of them but affirmeth that there are none of the sayde bookes divulged nor as yet perfectly or fully ymprinted, but some fewe sheetes only parte of w ch are at this p r sent in this exāīāts [i.e. examinant's] power; the residue he sayth were by his p er mission taken away and layed he knoweth not where to be kept by he knowes not whome untill the rest of the booke shalbe finished w ch wilbe he knowes not when, and then this exāīāt (as he saith) is verily p er suaded they wilbe brought forth to be added together. The sheets signed A, D, and E may have fallen into the hands of the stationers when they confiscated Wood's press, or they may have been among those whose whereabouts Wither did not know at the time he testified to the High Commission. 19 When and by whom the printing of The Schollers Purgatory was completed is unknown: the title page of the pamphlet bears the phrase, "IMPRINTED / For the Honest Stationers," without date or printer's name. In The Schollers Purgatory Wither stated his expectation that upon publication the stationers would employ "some of those hyreling Authors of theirs" in order to make "some foolish libell against me; or to publish an impudent reply to my Apology" (p. 115), but one can only speculate concerning the identity of the writer of the "Letter." The subscription, "ffrom the Goose Nest in / S t Nicholas Shambles," is no doubt ironic in intention, and derives from a passage of The Schollers Purgatory in which Wither declares of his enemies among the stationers: "yf any should happen to ouer-heare them at their Goosenest behind Saint Nicholas Shambles; Or vvhen a knot of them hath gotten a Cuntrey-Chapman, Citty-Customer, or nevv flovvne Academick, to some Drincking-schoole, vvithin the compasse of their verge; yt vvould deceaue a common iudgement to obserue vvhat grauitey, zeale, and learning, some of them vvill consume in rayling vpon my Hymnes" (p. 75). In a note on St. Nicholas Shambles in his Survey of London , Stow informs us: "behind the butchers shops be now diuers slaughter houses inward, and Tippling houses outward. This is called Mountgodard streete of the Tippling houses there . . . ." 20 Mountgodard Street seems a likely enough location, if one be sought, for the "Goose Nest." On the southern edge of the Shambles, it was close to the booksellers' shops of St. Paul's churchyard, and no doubt some of the stationers gave its tippling houses their patronage. The author of the "Letter" replies to the arguments, accusations and invective of The Schollers Purgatory point by point, following the order of the A, D, and E sheets almost exactly, but he gives more attention to those matters which directly affect the stationers than to the poet's defence of Hymnes and Songs against the charges of popishness and obscenity. He has no difficulty in bringing forth reasonable objections to the controversial clause in the patent, although he does not explain how he arrives at the figure of £300 as the annual profit expected from it by Wither. But larger issues, not to be dealt with so easily, are also involved, for in his pamphlet Wither had attacked the whole current system of publication and charged that many of the stationers showed no concern for the rights and interests of authors. It is upon this subject that The Schollers Purgatory and the "Letter" are most interesting. Although Wither is proud of his claims to the status of gentleman, and insistent that in his writings he intends good to church and state more than private profit, he displays in The Schollers Purgatory much of the viewpoint of the professional man of letters who attempts to earn his living by his pen. Thus, he complains that his opponents do not consider what an author "might haue gained, if he had bestowed the same tyme, charge, &amp; industry in other professions" as in letters (p. 93). He protests, indeed, that he sought the copyright of his Hymnes and Songs as the only means left him by the iniquitous practices of the stationers to "enioy the benifit of some part of myne owne labours" (while the other clause of the patent was an unsought for addition of the royal favor) (p. 5). The writer of the "Letter" had not, of course, seen all of the charges against the "meere Stationers" (whom the poet makes some attempt to distinguish from the apparently smaller number of "honest Stationers"), but even in the A sheets he had seen enough to make the substance of the attack clear. He had read Wither's general charge: "by an vniust custome . . . the Stationers haue so vsurped vpon the labours of all writers, that when they haue consumed their youth and fortunes in perfiting some laborious worke, those cruell Bee-masters burne the poore Athenian bees for their hony, or else driue them from the best part thereof by their long practiced cunninge" (p. 5); and, there can be little doubt, he had also seen the accusation that the stationers ". . . take vppon them to publish bookes contriued, altered, and mangled at their owne pleasurs, without consent of the writers: nay and to change the name some[t]yms, both of booke and Author (after they haue been ymprinted) and all for their owne priuate lucre" (pp. 10-11). 21 Upon the second charge the author of the "Letter" remains silent, but he replies to the first, in part by questioning the profitableness to the stationers of the poet's own writings, particularly Wither's Motto (1621). He is certainly right in stating that this work brought trouble to stationers as well as to its author. While Wither was imprisoned by the Privy Council for its satirical matter, John Marriot, John Grismond, Augustine Mathewes, and Nicholas Okes were fined, on June 4, 1621, by the Court of the Stationers' Company for printing and dispersing it without licence or entrance; and Marriot was charged at the same time with bringing out a second impression of 1,500 copies in defiance of the Court, which on May 14 had explicitly forbidden publication until further authority had been obtained. 22 As the "Letter" itself informs us, however, Wither had sold the copy for five pieces 23 to a stationer (presumably either Weaver, who possessed it on May 14, or Marriot and Grismond, who entered a version "corrected" by the licenser on June 16). It seems doubtful that the poet can be justly held responsible for the difficulties which befell Marriot and the others, for, as their own Company maintained, it was for them to look to the licensing of the work. Although the author of the "Letter" suggests that Motto became popular only because it was called in question, it might well be argued that Marriot must have considered the poem potentially profitable, since he was willing to take the risk of publishing its satirical passages without licence. Even more clearly Okes considered it a valuable commodity: possessing no right to the copy, he took the trouble to counterfeit one of Marriot's editions. 24 The bookseller John Grismond stated on July 10 that Marriot and Okes between them had produced 6,000 copies since their fining on June 4, and he also gave the rather amusing testimony that "Londs" (i.e. Matthew Lownes), Warden of the Company, had daily purchased copies since fining him and Marriot for publishing them. 25 If some stationers did not profit in this, the fault would hardly seem to be the poet's. Like his earlier satire, Abuses Stript and Whipt (1613), which also caused his imprisonment, and also received the distinction of piracy, 26 Motto was evidently a considerable popular success. The extent of the vulgar popularity of Wither's writings in 1623 is one of the subjects of Jonson's satirical comment in Time Vindicated . Wither's grievances and his concern to defend his patent undoubtedly make him, as A. W. Pollard held, a "bad witness" on the question of the Jacobean stationers' attitude towards authors' rights, 27 but the fact that he was in truth the writer of several commercially valuable works gives some weight to his charges in The Schollers Purgatory ; and a number of statements and silences in the "Letter" may well be taken to confirm W. W. Greg's judgment that, even when allowance is made for prejudice and exaggeration, Wither's "general statement of the case must be accepted." 28 Although the anonymous writer, like the poet himself, declares that the first consideration should be the public good, and postulates the ideal of a mutually satisfactory agreement between publisher and author, he clearly believes that the former's rights, to financial gain, at least, are superior to the latter's. On the one hand, "The profession of a Stacōner is to buy and sell, and to gaine by it if hee can"; on the other, "They are too Mercenary that write bookes for Money" (fol. 18 r ). Occupying eleven pages (fols. 17 r -22 r ), 8 by 12 inches, the "Letter" is the last of four items 29 which comprise British Museum MS. Add. 18,648. All are transcribed, presumably from manuscript sources, in the same clear seventeenth-century mixed hand. Unfortunately, the paper has entirely disintegrated in an area, which becomes progressively larger, near the top of every folio of the "Letter." In the transcript which follows, the resulting gaps in the text have been indicated by pointed brackets, within which conjectural readings or reconstructions have been supplied when the context or the relevant passage of The Schollers Purgatory provides sufficient guidance. A few insignificant deletions and interlineations occur in the manuscript: the former have not been recorded; the latter have been silently incorporated in the proper places. The spelling and punctuation of the original have been retained, but certain contractions have been expanded in italic type, the final "es" sign has been printed as "es", and the long "s" has been modernized. [Fol. 17 r ] A Coppie &lt;o&gt;f a Letter to George Wither in answere &lt;t&gt;o a late Pamphlet partly Imp&lt;rin&gt;ted by George Wood./ Good M r Wither: I haue seene some fewe imperfect sheetes, vizt A. D. E. of a booke that yo u haue lately caused to bee printed, dedicated to the Reverend Bishopps, and the Convocation house; and it seemes vnto mee to bee an Apologie for the Hymnes, and songs, you haue lately published: which when I had perused; I thought it the part of a ffreind, out of the respect I beare vnto you, to deliuer myselfe freely, what successe I thincke it is likely to haue./ My intent is spetially to deale in those things, that concerne the Stacōners, whom spightfully in your whole Booke you vniustly traduce, and most vncivilly abuse: and I feare it will soe disparage your discretion, that all your laboures will growe distastfull, and not regarded, because soe intemperate a Man as you are is theire author; and therfore they which haue made some stay therof, and supprest the Presse, are more your ffreindes (though perhapps against theire Wills) then you are aware off; that the world may not take notice of your spleene and follie. Before I come to answere for the Stacōners, I haue somewhat to say with your very preamble, where you begine to bragg of the testimonies you haue giuen, of your assertion to the peace, and prosperitie of the Church and comon wealth. Some of the testimonies you haue giuen are in scribling forth a fewe railing verses, that haue giuen occasion to idle people, to descant vpon them at theire pleasures, and interpret them to your discreditt; ffor writing wherof you were deseruedly laied by the heeles, and howsoeuer you mince the matter, and excuse yourselfe; [Fol. 17 v ] your offence was such, as was not to bee indured. Next you take vpon yo u , to teach the Convocation house, what should become th&lt;em&gt; in Charritie to doe towardes you, soe impudently and sawcily th&lt;at no&gt;e Man that Reades it will thincke it any Mans doing that had witt or discretion, but rather of some Schoole-Boy, that would bee whip't for his vnmanerlines. Then speaking of your troubles, you bring in two or three threadbare proverbs as Camomil must bee trodden on Plate hamer'd, grapes crush't, and I knowe not what, soe sencelesly and impertinently, that you had need begg for patience, as very well you doe of those that shall read it; to which Proverbs the Stacōners will add another, Bray a foole in a Morter, and hee will neuer learne wisdome, and soe you are answered in your owne kind. You come then to Iustifie yourselfe in your former writings, and in trueth therin you accuse the state of some iniustice, in shutting you up soe closely, where yo u could not haue the vse of your Pen, and were compelled to feed on course bread, and because afterwardes the State (in respect of your Youth, and that you wrote things at a venture, not vnderstanding what you did) were content to passe by your follies, you would make us beleeue yo u were vtterly blamelesse, and suffered all for nothing. Nowe having made this Preamble, and sharpened the dulnes of your Oratory, you fall terribly vpon the Stationers; and because they will not bee your Slaues, that you may liue by the sweate of theire Browes, and haue 300 li a yeare for a song, you raile outright and say they vsurpe on the labours of writers; and are like Bee-Masters, that burne the Bees for theire hony. Surely they neuer vsurped vpon yo u , and they hope there is noe good author, that hath cause to complaine: There be some like yourselfe, that thincke they haue neuer enough [Fol. 18 r ] when they deserue nothing at all, when their workes are burthensome bo&lt;th to &gt;Studies, and Shopps; and note this alwaies, that &lt;those who &gt;deserue least, thincke best of themselues&lt;, for &gt;noe Author (saies one) is soe bad, but hee thinckes himselfe euery Waie excellent. The profession of a Stacōner is to buy and sell, and to gaine by it if hee can, as all other Trades doe; They labour to deale in such comodities, as are most vendible; that will turne money readily, wherby they may liue; But theire case is worse then other Trades, for if sometimes they light vpon a vendible Booke, theire gaine is counted, talk't off, and envied. But theire Charge, theire huge piles of waist paper, and theire losses, are neuer once thought vpon or considered; and oftentimes they are enioyned to printe bookes, that lie on their handes, and are a greate hinderance vnto them. If any Author himselfe would for the generall good, or for his owne proffitt, haue the printing of his owne labours, and procure his ffreindes to disburse the charge, they were euer ready to further them in it. And most of the best Authors are not soe penurious that they looke soe much to theire gaine, as to the good they intend to Religion or State. They are too Mercenary that write bookes for Money, and theire couetuousnes makes theire labours fruitles, and disesteemed. The right course is in theis things, that the generall and publique good bee first and principally to bee respected, and then both the Author and Stacōner soe accomodated that each might haue what were fitting, in regard of theire places, paines, and charge; and thus euery good Author will deale with the Stacōner, and euery honest Stationer will thus vse his Author. And if the Bee (to whom you seeme to compare yourselfe, as properly you may; for you sting terribly, [Fol. 18 v ] though p er happs you bee a Drone euer after) will not part with some of the hony hee gathe&lt;rs &gt;what good does hee? it were better hee were burnt, o&lt;r dri&gt;ven &lt;fr&gt;om his hiue, then hee should consume it all himselfe. You proceed and say the Corporācon is inriched by your laboures; to which I answere that the Corporācon hath not got a groate, but spent many, in serching for, and suppressing some of your workes, and otherwise by your occasion. If any p ar ticular Man hath gott by you, they are the more behoulding to you for it; This I knowe some of your workes weere sold to any purpose, and for the best, you haue bene gratified in a sufficient proportion, as the poore Men that dealt with you well knowe; and the world knowes that you are not soe much aforehand, that you can weare Clothes soe handsomly, and spend your time for nothing, except you haue some other vaine, that but fewe Men are acquainted withall. Concerning your Motto, of my knowledge you had fiue peeces of the Stacōner before it came forth, w ch was more, then euer would haue bene gotten, if it had come forth orderly; But it had noe license, and was afterwardes forbidden, which put some life into it; you were in some trouble and soe was the Stationer, and lost his Bookes, But you were on the surer side, for you had your Money before hand. Well, then you come to say, amongst other idle things (for if I should stand vpon euery Bravado you make, I should neuer haue done) That his Ma tie favours your worthy Worke, and those that are esteemed amongst the most devoute, and learned of the Clergie: His Ma tie hath referred the whole Matter to foure of the most eminent, both in authoritie and for Iudgment, if they shall thincke it fitting that your Booke shall passe, and bee ioyned with the Psalme Booke, the Stacōners must conforme [Fol. 19 r ] themselues to th&lt;eire&gt; Censure, and dare not resist what they shall order&lt; &gt; Stationers haue laboured to obtaine a hearing, and&lt; &gt;en&lt; &gt; often to ioyne with them for the obtaynin&lt;g ther&gt;of, but (brag and prate as much as you will) you haue euer declined that course, and soe you did the Parliament house, when you absented and obscured yourselfe, for many daies together, and were sent for by a Messenger, and yet you vaunted before in diuers places, that if it were not Parliament proofe, you would cast all the Bookes, and Patent into the ffire. It is a poore Waye to leaue the course, that is directed by his Ma tes referrence, wherby you might bring this matter to some head, and fall to abusing better Men, and honester then yourselfe, and because you cannot haue your owne desires, thincke to get it by scoulding and calling them Pedlers, indeed if they had nothing to deale in but such trashe as yours, you might truly stile them as you doe. The language you vse would haue shewed best in a Riming Satyr, wherin you haue a facultie aboue other Men, for your Oratory indeed is somewhat dull, if you had versed them forth, it would haue made some sport, though there bee noe reason for it, yet wee should haue some Rhime for our Money. The whole Scripture is most sacred euery where, and noe part of it ought to bee handled but with greate Reuerence, and iudgement; You are a young fellowe, and some thincke it is greate pittie, that such an one, should bee suffered to thrust in his sickle, further then for his owne vse, and direction. But for you to take vpon you to teach, and reprooue others, whose Bookes you are not worthy to carry after them, is intollerable in a state, where there are soe many Reuerend and learned Men, that haue desired to doe the same thing that you doe; but out of respect they had to authoritie would not proceed, except they had bene imployed by publique Comaund. But whoe is soe bold as blind blink-eyed Bayard, [Fol. 19 v ] that dares in foule termes abuse hi&lt;s &gt;betters, and will take any thing in hand, that hee &lt; &gt; to doe withall, and when hee hath done the wh&lt;ole&gt; com&lt;on&gt; wealth, and all good Men must suffer to stopp his M&lt; &gt;and maintaine his Vanitiees. Yet you, will you not saie disparage the whole profession, The Printers, Bookbinders, and Claspe makers are beholding to you; for some of them (saie you) are honest Men, and they are greived at the oppression of the rest. What are they I pray you, that are soe greived? is not your Printer G. W. one of them? like enough for hee is one of your consort, and birdes of a feather will flocke together, a fit Copesmate to deale in a broken buisnes, whoe for his refractorines wilbe euer branded; hee came in by intrusion noe man knowes howe; hee hath bene in most Prisons most part of his time, and is neuer out of one Micheife or other; if there were nothing els to hinder yo r buisnes, the very ioyning with him would make it odious, and this is one of your honest Men. But nowe (if euer) the furie is rais'd, when yo u terme them excrementes, vermine, Wormes, and fleas, and all this proceedes not from Mallice or Envie, and your conscience doth witnes theis termes to bee charritable, and necessarie, for soe you say a little before. Does any Body beleeue you? if this bee conscionable dealing, you haue a very large conscience, and revengfull, to abuse a profession that neuer did you wrong, but more Credit then you deserue. But this is like a blind gal'd-bark't Iade, that laies aboute him at hee knowes not what, when he feeles any smart. I could speake p ar ticularly of the titles you afford them, and turne them home vpon you with a vengeance, But all that heare and Read them say, truly they proceed from some distemper of the braine; and I am too blame to spend time with a Man, whom the opinion of himselfe hath made starke Mad; yet you say something when you confesse [Fol. 20 r ] that your first P&lt;oem&gt;s discouer your Childishnes, &amp; indiscretion and wee see th&lt; &gt; discouers your Pride, insolencie, and madnes, &lt; &gt; forward (with this) that the Bookseller&lt;s shall c&gt;ontinue, and bee well accompted off, necessarie&lt;an&gt;d vsefull, when such a fellowe as yourselfe shall die in an hospitall. You haue then a fling at the old Psalme booke, to w ch I say noe more but this: The expressions of the holy Ghost in those Nombers, which you call Rude and Barbarous, haue bene soe well accepted off, that euen vse hath made them holy, and doe comfort and encourage Gods people soe, that your newe affected devises, shall neuer bee able to disparage them, much lesse to thrust them out of doores, and put in your owne at your desire. But still you pretend greate good to the Church, and take vpon you to instruct and direct, not only the simple &amp; ordinary sort, but divines and teachers, and the whole Church, howe they will take it at your handes I knowe not, but if you had the 300 li a yeare that you ayme at, whatsoeuer the Church should get by your labours, I am sure you should bee well paied for your paines; and to that end you would haue them pack't into our Liturgie, that Men might be compelled to buy them with the old Psalme booke, that soe, whether they proue vsefull or noe, you shall bee sure to haue them taken of your handes. Besides your former sufferings in Prison, you talke of sufferings in this very buisnes. You haue lost nothing but that you neuer had; you haue bene something too forward to print soe many, before you knewe howe to vent them. If this bee your suffering, you may thancke yourselfe or your Printer G: W. that being a beggar and a foole, wilbee forward enough to doe any Mischeife. Nowe by the waie let mee say one thing vnto you, which Methinckes is vnanswerable (that is) That if your Booke bee soe excellently well Composed, as you make accompt it is, [Fol. 20 v ] howe can the Stacōners disparage i&lt;t (&gt;being as you say, but ignorant Men) for those wh&lt;oe be lear&gt;ned and Iudicious, would by it the rather be&lt; &gt;Men doe condemne it. Nay farther (to vse your owne&lt; &gt;) That those yo r hymnes being warrantable in themselues, Noe mans authority shalbee able to dishonor them. Nay if my Lord of Canterbury (whose grace you mention not with that respect becomes you, and accuse you knowe not whom for abusing his name) in disparagement of your aforesaid Booke, and therin (as in other passages) you are exceeding sawcy. If his eminency (as you say) cannot excuse them, if they bee not Iustifiable in theire owne Nature, howe can the Stacōners make you or them acceptable or odious. I must say this for the Stacōners; though I bee noe Bookseller, yet I am very conversant, and often amongst them, and I neuer heard any Man in all my life, speake any word against your booke or Patent, more then this, that they hoped and desired, to bee left at libertie to bind them w th the Psalmes, only for those that would haue them together, and not to bee Compelled to put them into all theire Bookes for euery Customer; and they yeilded theise reasons, that it would bee more importable, and not bee euery Mans money, for he that hath viij d hath not xij d , and soe it would hinder the sale of Bibles, and other Bookes, that the Psalmes are vsually put vnto. Therefore it is likely that the exceptions you make against your owne Booke, which you lay vpon the Stacōners and scould with them for, are altogether of your owne making, out of a guiltines in yourselfe, or are taken up in Tipling houses, and brought vnto you by Companions of your owne, and not from Men of worth or Creditt. God forbid that any but Atheistes or Drunckardes, should terme the scriptures in any place obscene; but if you render them not vnto us, in that grauitie, as they [Fol. 21 r ] are deliuered in s&lt;crip&gt;ture, you may giue occasion of greate offence. My inten&lt;t is not to medd&gt;le, in a matter of soe high a Nature. I &lt; on&gt;ly m&lt;e&gt;ddle with soe much of your Booke as concern&lt;es&gt; the Stacōners; And whether the Apologie you make &lt;w&gt;ill Redeeme you from blame, or the answeres you make to your owne obiections, wilbee admitted to further your Designes; I leaue them to bee censured by such as can Iudge, and haue power to reforme if they bee amisse. And soe I passe ouer all your obiections, and meete with you againe, where you meete with the Stacōners. But say you, Scriueners, and Costermongers, Porters, and Tripewiues, Chaundlers, and ffidlers; and I knowe not whoe, haue scoffed at you, in Taphouses and Tavernes: Then (say I) I could wishe you to come noe more among them, for they will scoffe at better Men then you; and hee that toucheth pitch shalbee defiled. But all this say you must bee long of the Stacōners. If some Idle headed ffellowe hath blurted out some wordes of your Bookes, is it faire dealing to cast your aspertions vpon them in generall? you should haue set downe whoe they are, and then you might haue receiued a reasonable answere. To bring your ambitious designes the better forward, you would faine interest the King himselfe, and the whole Church, and therfore yo u accuse you knowe not whom; but they must needes bee Stacōners for opposing authoritie, and seeking to ouerthrowe the discipline of the Church; and when you haue writt it, you thincke you haue done brauely. But howe doe they oppose authoritie? haue they not peticōned his Ma tie in this cause, and hath not his Ma tie graceously referred it to most Reverend Men? and hath not his Ma tie expressed himselfe, that hee intended noe restraint, or burthen on the subiect, nor breach of order to the preiudice of others? and haue not the Stationers (as I said before) much desired the matter might bee [Fol. 21 v ] determined; and submitted themsel&lt;ues t&gt;o his Ma tes order. But such trickes as theis &lt; &gt;e you good, but Returne back vpon yo u to &lt; &gt; Then to helpe the matter yo&lt;u &gt;t forth; and brag that you might haue bene hired, and had g&lt;oo&gt;d entertainment to imploy yourselfe, in se&lt;t&gt;ting forth here&lt;tica&gt;ll fancies, and that you haue bene woed by Sectaries. I must needes saie you would haue done them very good seruice, for by this booke you showe, that you haue an excellent facultie to abuse your betters, and to forge vntrueths, but when you come to proue any thing, you would haue left that to themselues. I passe ouer much good matter, because I begine to bee wearie, But at the Goose-Nest I will meete you againe, you knowe the place I perceiue well; and sure you were there sucking a Goose egge, in some Corner of the house, when the Stacōners mett, or howe could you knowe howe they vse theire Customers, or what they talke of when they are together; It was noe good manners to eausdropp your ffreindes. But in good earnest doe you thincke it possible for any Stacōner to talke soe sencelesly as you would make them? It will rather bee thought by them that read this straine, that you being a fine Poet, to make some sport withall, would heere trie howe you could act the fooles part, in a Play of your owne making, and thats all breifly I will say of the Goose Nest. The reasons you alledge for your Hymne of S t George I like reasonable well; But you might haue added that for the names sake it was fitting you should doe something, the Inne, or Alehouse where you lye, being the Signe of S t George on horsbacke might moue to yo u a little therto, and if you haue a Lady or Mistris there, or els where, you are euery way a Compleate Champion; for though you neuer Rescued Lady, [Fol. 22 r ] Yet by the he&lt; &gt;aken out of the Staconers Goose Nest, &lt; &gt; a Booke (it may come forth) will make &lt; &gt;osterities. Thus&lt; &gt; written in the Stacōners behalfe, that you &lt; &gt;wh&lt;at &gt;it is to abuse a Societie, and if in &lt;s&gt;ome place I bee ouersharpe, you may thancke yourselfe that gaue the occasion, by putting your handes into a Waspes Nest, for if you had taken a quiet course, you should haue bene sure of a ffreindly end. ffarewell./ ffrom the Goose Nest in S t Nicholas Shambles./</field>

See also Leo Kirschbaum, Shakespeare and the Stationers (1955), pp. 57, 131. 2 The most important sections of the patent are given by Arber, who misdates it January 17 (IV, 13-14). It is printed in full in Rymer's Foedera , XVII (1727), 454-455. In his Collection of Emblemes (1635) Wither states that the late William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, restored him to the royal favor at a time when James I was offended by his "Free Lines ," and that the King subsequently bestowed upon him a gift which would have enriched him if others had not thwarted its intention (sig. (*), following p. 196). I take this to be an allusion to Wither's imprisonment for the satire of Motto (1621) and to the patent which was afterwards granted him, although it has been otherwise interpreted by J. Milton French in PMLA , XLV (1930), 960. No doubt James' well known interest in sacred verse was a factor: as historians of hymnology have recognized, Hymnes and Songs has good claims to be considered the first comprehensive English hymn book. 3 Records of the Court of the Stationers' Company 1602 to 1640 , ed. W. A. Jackson (1957) (hereafter cited as Jackson), p. 156. 4 Jackson, p. 162. 5 The Schollers Purgatory , pp. 95-96. Wither points out the weakness of the stationers' position in attacking his monopoly in order to defend their own (p. 28). 6 In the form of a printed broadside (undated), purporting to represent the views of bookbinders "to the number of fourescore and upward," in the possession of the Society of Antiquaries, London (No. 225 in R.

It was no doubt printed for purposes of propaganda, but it reveals the evasive practices of the stationers too fully to have been inspired by the Company to the degree that Wither suggests. 7 Journals of the House of Commons , I, 789. 8 Ibid. , I, 792. 9 The author of the "Letter" suggests that Wither himself invented some of the objections to his work (fol. 20 v ); probably, indeed, the poet does exaggerate the extent of this attack, since of the "multytude of papers in print" against his hymns and patent, to which he refers in The Schollers Purgatory (p. 28), only the bookbinders' broadside petition appears to survive. 10 In their petition the bookbinders complain that Wither seized copies from them, rather than from the owners directly. In The Schollers Purgatory (p. 103), Wither claims that he used his power reluctantly, and afterwards voluntarily returned the volumes which he had confiscated to the booksellers. 11 Acts of the Privy Council, 1623-25 , pp. 274-275; 1627 , pp. 29-30; Jackson, pp. 192, 247. 12 See Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series (hereafter cited as S.P.D. ), 1633-34 , p. 533; 1635 , p. 118; 1635-36, p. 80. According to a letter of Edward Rossingham to Sir Thomas Puckering, dated January 23, 1633, the "Board" (i.e. Privy Council?) refused at this time to uphold a patent requiring the stationers to bind Wither's metrical Psalms with all Bibles (British Museum MS. Add. 4,178, first cited by R. A. Willmott, Lives of Sacred Poets [1834], pp. 127-128). No other record appears to exist, however, that Wither ever gained such a patent, and possibly there is confusion here with the privilege for Hymnes and Songs . In their petition the bookbinders had complained that this work was too lengthy to be added to the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter when the latter was bound with the Testament and Communion Book, in accordance with the common practice. Cf. the anonymous "Letter," fol. 20 v . 13 His first new work to be regularly printed in England after 1622 was the Emblemes in 1634-35. He claims to have printed the whole of Britain's Remembrancer (1628) with his own hands (sig. B3 v ), and he published his Psalmes of David (1632) in the Netherlands. 14 See Jackson, pp. xiv-xvi. Like Wither, Wood had secured a patent (for printing linen cloth); and he used it to cover some of his illegal activities. 15 So Wither reveals in the testimony to the Court of High Commission which is referred to below. 16 Ben Jonson , ed C. H. Herford, P. and E. Simpson (1925-52), VII, 661. The editors note that in some respects this allusion suits Wood (X, 653), but are unaware of any connection between him and Wither before The Schollers Purgatory . The possibility of the identification is strengthened by the discovery of the earlier association, although Jonson's masque, which was performed on January 23, 1623, slightly antedates the patent. 17 Jackson, pp. 169-170. 18 "The p er sonall Annsweares of George Wither of Lincolnes Inn gent made by vertue of his Corporall oath to the articles objected against him by his Ma ties Comissioners for causes Eccl esiast icall," Public Record Office MS., S.P. 14, vol. CLVII, no. 59. The document bears the poet's signature but is undated. An abstract in S.P.D., 1623-25 (p. 143) lacks many of the details of the original. 19 The pamphlet collates ( : ) 4 A-H 8 I 2 . Jackson suggests that ( : ) A-B were printed at one press, presumably Wood's, and C-I at another, but does not give evidence (p. 17o n ). The title, of which the author of the "Letter" is ignorant (although it was known to officials of the Stationers' Company after their confiscation of Wood's press), appears nowhere but on the first of the preliminary sheets. 20 Ed. C. L. Kingsford (1908), I, 343. 21 Here Wither may well have in mind Thomas Walkley's publication in 1620 of the "foolishly intituled" Workes , to which he evidently objected on several grounds. See "The Stationer's Postscript," Faire Virtue (1622), sig. P8; and see also Leo Kirschbaum in The Library , 4th. Ser., XIX (1938-39), 339-346. 22 Jackson, pp. 135, 175, 466-468; Arber, IV, 53, 56. Marriot, who states that the Company brought him before the Archbishop of Canterbury, afterwards denied any deliberate defiance of the order ( S.P.D., 1619-23 , p. 274). 23 Wither mentions the same amount, stating that, after failing to obtain a licence for Motto himself, he sold the work to others who offered to print it ( S.P.D., 1619-23 , p. 268). 24 See S.P.D., 1619-23 , p. 275. 25 Ibid. , p. 274-275.

      <field name="heading_text">An Editorial Experiment: Suckling's A Sessions of the Poets by L. A. Beaurline *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The usual method of editing seventeenth-century poems has been to choose the earliest printed edition as a copy-text and to depart from it only when that printed text is manifestly corrupt. Variant manuscripts are relegated to the notes or, if too radically variant, to the appendix. Thus Grierson put his faith in the 1633 edition of Donne's poems; Rhodes Dunlap virtually reprinted Carew's 1640 edition; F. E. Hutchinson based his text on Herbert's 1633 edition, even though he had access to a manuscript fair copy containing the licence to print and another manuscript seen and corrected by the author; L. C. Martin used Herrick's Hesperides (1648); and G. Moore Smith followed Lord Herbert's Occasional Poems (1665) in preference to a manuscript corrected by the author. Such reverence for printed texts is hardly justified by the circumstances, for in most instances the authors were dead before publication, and the character of copy that lay behind the book is obscure. We know little about how or where the publisher got his poems and less about the textual history of the extant manuscripts. Only Helen Gardner has seriously questioned the relative value of various witnesses for a poetical text of the period. In her edition of Donne's The Divine Poems (1952), after an elaborate analysis and construction of manuscript trees, she found reason to base her text on the 1633 edition, although she did not follow it slavishly. It is only sensible that, when a number of independent manuscripts survive alongside a printed edition, an editor ought to take them all seriously until he has reason to value them otherwise, and when analysis suggests that one witness stands closest to an author's original, whether it be print or manuscript, that witness should be the basis of the edition. Such a procedure has difficulties when applied to poems. For a single poem is usually too short to yield a sizeable number of variants for analysis, publishers want a uniform texture of accidentals for all poems, and editors do not have confidence in the old method of recension. The doubts about traditional textual analysis reached a climax when George Kane roundly challenged the method of recension, in his edition of the A version of Piers Plowman (1960), and there is a good deal of skepticism about Vinton Dearing's large claims in his Manual of Textual Analysis (1959). Nevertheless the outlines of a more reliable procedure are visible in W. W. Greg's A Calculus of Variants (1927), combined with Dearing's early chapters, especially his remarks on the ambiguity of distributional formulas. As an example of what can be done with multiple texts of poems, I shall suggest that at least two manuscripts of "The Witts," better known under the title "A Sessions of the Poets," probably stand closer to the author's papers than any of the printed editions, and consequently that a critical editor should base his text of this poem on a manuscript and treat the printed versions in the same way he would the other less authoritative manuscripts. If my reasoning is correct, it has serious consequences for the editorial method applied to Donne, Herbert, Carew, Suckling, Lord Herbert, and perhaps other poets of the time. Need scholars use such ingenuity to defend readings in printed texts against a number of independent manuscripts? Should an editor base his text on the printed version "for the sake of uniformity" rather than depart to a manuscript for this or that poem? "A sessions was held the other day" exists in seven manuscripts and eight printed editions which appeared before 1700. The analysis of them is in five steps: 1) brief description of each witness with relevant bibliographical evidence, 2) the elimination of the obviously derivative states, on textual and bibliographical evidence, 3) a distributional study of the type two variants, 4) a directional study of the type one and type two variants, 5) construction of a genealogical tree. The reason for such a rigorous, step by step method, first brought forward by Archibald Hill in "Postulates for the Distributional Study of Texts," Studies in Bibliography , III (1950), 63-96, is partly to avoid confusion but more to avoid bringing literary assumptions into the study before bibliographical, statistical and other forms of objective evidence have been exhausted. Otherwise we may beg the question by assuming that we know what the corruptions are before we have established the lines of transmission. 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I A Description of the Witnesses Bodleian MS Malone 13 (M) A small poetical miscellany of the late 1630's, pp. 1-91, 253-258, 291-311 written in a large Italian hand, mixed with a few secretary forms. The left margin is ruled with pencil, and the general appearance is neat and professional. It contains verses by Sidney Godolphin, Davenant, Carew, William Murray, Waller, and Faulkland, all of whom are mentioned in Suckling's poem, pp. 31-35. Dates in the MS. are of the 1620's and 1630's, the latest of which is May 10, 1638. Harvard MS Eng. 703 (Ha) A small miscellany, 81 leaves in several hands, containing poems by Jonson, Godolphin, Waller, Edward Herbert, and Carew. The dates begin at 1624 (f. 1) and proceed in approximate order, 1625 (f. 27 v ), 1629 (f. 40), 1639 (f. 66 v ), 1641 (f. 75 v ), 1638 (f. 75 v ), and 1641 (f. 76 v ). Suckling's poem appears among the later group, ff. 70-72, in the same hand as ff. 43-49, 51-55, and 73-75. Huntington Library MS HM 198 (Hn) A large collection of early seventeenth-century poems and letters. Part I contains 207 numbered pages, all written in the same small, mixed hand, except for some Elizabethan poems attached to blank and unnumbered pages at the beginning. Most of the authors were active before 1630, and most of the allusions are to the 1620's or before. The thirties are alluded to in the satire on Suckling's hundred horse. The poem falls on pp. 201-203 of part I. It has been previously noted by P. H. Gray in "Suckling's A Sessions of the Poets as a Ballad: Boccalini's 'Influence' Examined," SP , VI (1939), 60-69, and Herbert Berry, Sir John Suckling's Poems and Letters from Manuscript , "University of Western Ontario Studies in the Humanities," No. 1 (1960), pp. 33-47. Bodleian MS Eng. Poet. c. 53 (E) A poetical miscellany, 23 leaves in various hands, with poems concerning the late 1630's. There are several satires on Suckling's Aglaura (printed 1638) and on his hundred horse. Leaves 18-19, where "A Sessions" is found, were once separate from the collection, as witnessed by the paper and its creases. The hand is very small, a mixture of Italian and secretary forms. 2 Sackville (Knole) MS U 269 F 36 (S) A single sheet folded once to provide two leaves. The poem is on ff. 1-2. On f. 2 v is an inscription in the hand of Lionel Cranfield, Earl of Middlesex (1575-1645), the uncle of the poet: "Rymes / Of som Poetts / Of som Wittes / About London / Septemb r 1637." The document shows that it once was folded into a small square suitable for enclosing with a letter. The handwriting of the poem has been identified as probably that of John Langley, Middlesex's estate agent at Melcot. 3 Cornell University Library MS E 7003 (C) A pretty piece of 17th-century handwriting in mixed forms, on one sheet folded once. The poem is on ff. 1-2. New York Public Library MS "Suckling Collection" (N) Three leaves, once a part of a larger volume, watermarked "Smith &amp; Alnutt 1822," in an 18th or early 19th-century hand. 4 This manuscript is clearly a copy of the Huntington MS, which it follows closely; where Hn has corrected its errors, N gives the corrected reading; where Hn makes errors, N follows, as at line 37 Hn misreads modest he for modestly . At the end of N is the note: "The above is transcribed from an old M.S. probably contemporary with the first circulation of the poem" and a reference to line 69-72, which the copyist found omitted from "Chalmer's edition of the English poets," subscribed "JH", which may be James Halliwell-Phillipps (1820-1889). Fragmenta Aurea, 1646 (46) The first collection of Suckling's work, printed for Humphrey Moseley and "published by a Friend to perpetuate his memory," printed "by his owne Copies." (See Greg's Bibliography of the English Printed Drama , III, 1130-1131.) Although Moseley claims that the printer's copy was holograph, there was a tradition reported by Elijah Fenton in The Works of Edmund Waller Esq r (1729), p. xix, that "A small number of Suckling's Plays were printed for himself, to present to the Quality when they were Acted at Court; but, his Poems and Letters were published by his friend the Earl of Denbigh , after his death; from such imperfect copies as his Lordship could hastily collect: therefore it is not strange if many of them still retain their original corruption." 5 Another kind of evidence weakens Moseley's claim for authorial copy. The compositor of the section containing the poems was apparently the same workman in Ruth Raworth's printing house who set type for parts of Davila's History of the Civill Wars in France (1647), section VI of the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio (1647), and all of the Poems of Mr. John Milton (1645). Although I shall describe his work more fully at another time, I can report that he appears to have been a careful and accurate compositor, who changed his copy very little except to add commas and alter spelling. He left behind evidence of his work by a tendency to alter the suffixes -all, ell, -ill, and -ull to -al, -el, -il, and -ul ; to change only to onely, -nesse to -nes ; wee , yee , and hee to we , ye , and he ; -ie to -y ; doe , goe , and soe to do , go , and so ; and find , mind , and kind to finde , minde , and kinde . Otherwise he drops all terminal e 's, changes -es 's to -s 's, and in Milton's Poems especially, he will even drop the e from come and some . He follows copy for either agen/again Ile/I'll , and occasionally he allows his copy to influence him to deviate from his distinctive habits. Consequently it is possible to discern that certain spellings were derived from his copy when the compositor deviates from his normal practice. For instance, if -all, only, -nesse , or goe appear in his portion of a text, unless he seems to be justifying a line of prose, those spellings came from his copy. Such evidence is important for "A Sessions" because a number of spellings in it are not normal for the compositor: bigge , easie , publiquely , mind , and than (for then in more then any man ). Once he uses agen and three times again . All of these were apparently in the copy from which he set type. However, in his extant letters, 6 Suckling did not spell bigge , agen or than in that fashion. Therefore the copy must not have been holograph. Fragmenta Aurea, 1648 (48) A reprint of 1646 with twenty alterations in "A Sessions" that could not have been made without reference to a manuscript. Fragmenta Aurea 1658 reprinted 1646; 1672 (?) reprinted 1648; 1694-96 reprinted 1658. Merry Drollery, [1661?], ( 61 ) A large collection of ballads, catches, and epigrams that often had been separately in print before, reprinted in 1670, 1691 (and in 1875 by J. W. Ebsworth). On pages 72-77 is "A Sessions of wit," whose spellings, punctuation, and substantive readings are virtually identical with the text of 48, except for the title, the lack of indentations of transitional words between stanzas, and a few compositorial errors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II A Distributional Study of the Variants Texts N and 61 can be eliminated from the analysis immediately as derivative versions which reproduce readings that are peculiar to their extant ancestors, Hn and 48 respectively. In the same fashion we can ignore all the other descendants of 46 and 48, as mere reprints, each of which successively introduces more corruption. And 48 itself is a derivative of 46 even though 48 contains certain new readings which cannot be the work of a mere compositor. The corrections and alterations in 48 have come from some other manuscript traditions, separate from the MS. behind 46. Consequently 48 must be treated as a contaminated or mixed text, part derivative and part substantive. Since it is not strictly a collateral text, descending from an ancestor common to the other witnesses, we must for the moment set it aside. This leaves M, Ha, S, C, Hn, E, and 46 for distributional study. Below is a table of substantive variants. The terms type 1 and type 2 have come from Greg: type 1 is the occurrence of a reading in one text against all the others; type 2 is the agreement of at least two texts against at least two of the others. Among the type 2 variants I have not tabulated elisions, minor omissions, expansions, punctuation, or spellings of proper names, because they could easily have arisen independently.

For instance, the first column of the chart shows that all the texts are terminal, as we should expect, since the derivative ones have been eliminated. The Sackville MS. has an unusual number of type 1 variants, so many as to suggest that it is another version (i.e. an early draft or later revision) or a very corrupt transcription. But an inspection of S's type 2 variants immediately cancels out the former hypothesis, because S is not likely to be another version in another manuscript tradition and at the same time to have type 2 variants that distribute along with the other six texts. How could it be closely associated with C, apparently not another version, and still be a revision or early draft, unless we suppose that the author wrote his revisions on an already derivative manuscript and S is a descendant of it? Therefore, I assume that S is collateral or virtually so with the other texts; and if that is true, S is very corrupt. A number of individual readings in S confirm this hypothesis (if I may depart from a rigidly statistical analysis for this point), because they are regularly "improvements" of an especially obvious sort: smoothing out the verse, simplifying the grammar, and trivializing the thought. Each man had a mind to gratifie the queene Σ 7 That all Men desired to please the queene S (line 70) And haveing spied him, called him out of the thronge Σ And calling him presently out of the thronge S (91) Was now to be given to him best deserved Σ Was now to be given to him that deserved S (4) For his were caled workes, where others were but plaies Σ For his things were workes, the others but plaies S (20) Of errors that had lasted many an age Σ Of errors continued for many an age S (22) in theire judgments they went lesse That concluded of merit uppon a successe. Σ they did much digress From truth, that judg'd things by the success. S (51-52) Must carie it: at which Ben turned aboute Σ Must carie the Bayes: At which Ben turn'd about S (27) Modestly hop't the handsomnes of's muse Σ Modestly hop't that his handsome muse S (42) Consider'd he was well hee had a Cupbearers place Σ Consider'd he was well hee had a Sewers place S (40) The last example is indicative of S's literal adherence to historical fact. Technically Thomas Carew was indeed Sewer to the King and not Cupbearer, but in the court of Apollo where a god is deciding who should wear the crown of laurel, cup-bearer is more appropriate, for we hear of a cup-bearer to the gods, but not a Sewer. Nor would a scribe reading Sewers be likely to change it to Cup-bearers . On the other hand such a change could have been made by the author, but since the other readings in S appear to be sophistications rather than "original" states, this one instance is not enough to establish S as an early version. The type 2 variants in the chart imply that certain manuscripts are probably related more closely than others: SC against the others, EHn against the others, and 46EHn against the others. Neither M nor Ha is closely identified with any single manuscript or group of manuscripts, if we assume that four or more exclusive readings suggest a close relationship. If this seems like a small number, we must remember that only twenty-three type 2 variants are suitable for the analysis. The only variants considered in this class are those that could not have easily arisen independently. Of course some anomailes exist, readings that are common to SHn, or HaE in one instance alone. These are to be expected, particularly with poems which were memorized, set to music, and passed around in London society. Consequently the lines of descent of a given manuscript may be considerably more tangled than we suppose; however there simply is not enough statistical evidence for a hundred line poem such as this on which to construct a more complicated hypothesis. Therefore a critic must make whatever distributional hypothesis is warranted by the majority of the evidence. The formula SC: M: Ha[46(HnE)] best expresses the groupings of type 2 variants. Diagramatically, the formula looks like this: Several of the complex variants confirm this formula. For instance, these patterns occur: SC:MHa:46Hn:E (grouping of stanzas and location of transitions) SCM:Ha46E:Hn (placing lines 93-94) C:SMHa:Hn46E (line 53) These suggest that Hn46E are separate from HaM and SC, and yet Ha, when it is separate from M, is associated with HnE46. Neither Hn nor E ever appears alone with 46 against the other; HnE appear alone four times and HnE46 five times. But the formula is ambiguous, for if the texts are truly collateral the diagrams could be any of the following: And if the witnesses are not collateral, we can have combinations such as:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III A Directional Study of the Variants To resolve these ambiguities, we must use other kinds of evidence. The dates on the manuscripts put all of them before 1646, and S is the only one with a definite date, September 1637, one month after the poem was written. But even there Cranfield's note indicates that manuscripts were circulating "about London" in September of that year. Furthermore S itself has the signs of a corrupt version; thus an early date means little. As is commonly known in manuscript study, a late manuscript can easily have been copied from an authoritative early one, whereas an early manuscript can be very corrupt, with many intermediaries between it and the archetype. A similar difficulty comes with study of the accidentals of the witnesses. We can seldom be sure that a scribe did or did not use a holograph manuscript as his copy, for scribes stamp a manuscript with their own habits of spelling and punctuation even more distinctly than compositors of printed books. And again, we can not be sure that another manuscript did not intervene between the scribal copy and the archetype. For simplicity we assume that one has not. Although Suckling's habits of spelling are known from his autograph letters, distinctive authorial spellings do not bleed through the work of these scribes. In the case of the printed edition of 1646, a kind of negative proof has been made, above, to show that authorial papers were not used as copy for the poem. One other kind of evidence remains: the inherent nature of the variants themselves, the directional variants. We are looking for signs of originality and derivation so as to decide which witnesses stand closer to the archetype than the others. If original readings occur in more than one manuscript, they must descend independently from the archetype, but if original readings appear in only one witness, the descent of the manuscripts is radically altered (as in diagrams D, E, and F). The signs of an original reading or directional change, listed by Dearing, vary considerably in their reliability. In the discussion above, S has been shown to be more sophisticated, simplified, and smoothed out than the others: this is one of the best kinds of proof of a derivative text. A misreading that can go only one way is another strong proof. Also the reading that makes sense rather than nonsense is likely to be more original, but this kind is often reversible, for a scribe may make sense out of a corruption in his archetype. On the other hand, a more difficult reading is not necessarily the more original; nor is the "better" reading or more poetic reading necessarily more original. A number of directional variants establish M and Ha as most probably closer to the archetype than any of the other witnesses. The strongest case can be made for the format of the stanzas, in conjunction with significant omissions that would not have arisen unless the archetype were arranged in the pattern of the Malone and the Harvard manuscripts. These manuscripts separate the four-line stanzas by spaces, and they link pairs of stanzas by a system of monosyllabic words suspended between them. S and C group the stanzas in eight lines, C indenting the last four lines of each octave, while neither uses the suspended words between. At the other extreme, E uses four-line stanzas without suspended words, and does not pair any of the stanzas. In placing the monosyllables, Hn and 46 seven times agree with MHa and the other eight times with E; but 46 and Hn do not always suspend the monosyllable between the same pairs of stanzas. In other words, 46 suspends in the middle of octaves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 13, while Ha suspends in octaves 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The sense of the poem clearly falls into eight-line units, so that either SC or MHa is likely to have been in the author's manuscript. If we assume that Suckling was careless with such details and wrote his original as we see E, it does not seem probable that a scribe would invent such an unusual scheme as in MHa, and we cannot easily explain the regular presence of the linking words at the beginning of the fifth line of each octave. Next assume that Suckling started to write the verses with the suspended words but he dropped the habit about halfway through where Hn or 46 leave off. It is possible that a scribe who liked consistency would have finished out the scheme, to produce the format of M and Ha. This possibility is demonstrated by the mistaken addition of a transitional word between lines 56 and 57 in Ha. However the facts contradict such an hypothesis, for at line 53 and 107 all the texts except 46 retain the transitional word, in either the suspended position or as the first word of a line. Why should such omissions occur in 46 at these points, unless an ancestor of 46 had the words in their suspended positions and they were overlooked by the copyist? A similar omission arose independently in 46, M, and Hn at line 93, where only two lines of a stanza survive. C and E read Then as the first word of the line, S reads Next , and Ha suspends Then between the stanzas. The distributional study showed that M is not closely related to 46Hn, nor are C and E and Ha closely related. Therefore the archetype must have read Then and the word must have been suspended between the stanzas, or else it could not have been so easily overlooked by M, Hn, and 46. The assumption that SC have the original format is destroyed by the same kind of evidence, for both of them omit And at line 21, and C omits But at line 29. By elimination, the only hypothesis which fits the evidence is that M and Ha have the original format. Therefore, we must conclude that the repeated copying of the poem caused the gradual omission or rearrangement of the suspended words, a theory which is nicely confirmed by the way the compositor of Merry Drollery , 1661, dropped out or realigned suspensions which he found in his copy of 1648, making the format of the stanzas like that in E. The title contains another directional variant, for "The Witts" is probably the original title of the poem that was sung before the King in New Forest, in August 1637. George Garrard, in a letter to Thomas Wentworth, called it "a Ballad made of the Wits," 8 and Lionel Cranfield wrote on the back of his copy (S), "Of som Poetts / Of som Wittes." Only 46 has "A Sessions of the Poets"; ESC have no title; and M, Ha, and Hn have "The Witts." The word sessions probably crept into 46's title from the first line, "A Sessions was held the other day," although it does seem peculiar that 46, along with S, reads Session in the first line and Sessions in the title. Other directional changes depend upon the plain sense of some readings over others. Thus 46 appears to be corrupt in For had not her care furnished you out instead of the majority reading For had not her Character furnished you out (61) Hn, E, and 46 are probably corrupt at line 53, Suddenly takeing his place againe HnE46 Sullenly takeing his place againe Σ (original) because "Sullenly" is a mood appropriate to the disappointed poet, and "Suddenly" was probably introduced because the scribe saw that Will Barkeley had smiled a few lines before. C changed Sullenly to Silently , possibly for the same reason. A peculiar substantive change at line 88 may have occurred because of a misreading. But Monsceure was modest, and silent confest HaSC But Monsceure was modest, and silence confest 46HnE M follows neither, with the word silene . Silent may be the original reading because it involves more complicated grammar; but did M mean to put a t instead of an e or did his copy read silence and he left out the c ? It cannot be determined either way. The probabilities favor silent as the harder reading. A similar puzzle is at line 29. (a) But those that were there thought it not soe fitt MHn (b) But those that were there thought it not fitt Ha46E (c) But those that were there did not think it fitt SC 9 Reading (a) is most likely original because M and Hn have been shown to be independent witnesses (in the distributional study above), and it seems unlikely that two scribes would have added the same word soe at the same point, but it is possible for Ha46E to have independently dropped the word in order to improve the meter. And (c) is derivative because it appears to be another attempt to make iambic meter of the basically anapestic rhythm. 10 A few errors can be explained as transpositions or slips of the eye over similar words in nearby text. But wiser Appollo bid him draw nigher Σ But wise Appollo bid him draw nigher M (105) (original) Appollo stopt him there, and bade him not go on 46HnCE Appollo stopt him here, and bid him not goe on HaMS (25) (original) The second of the readings at line 25 may be original because the word there can be seen in exactly the same place in the line beginning the following stanza. Suckling next was called but did not appeare But straight one whispered 46 (line 73) Here But has been retained in the eye of the compositor of 46, substituted for and in the second line, as it reads in Σ. At line 42, the scribe of Ha wrote "in travelling France" rather than "travelling in France" (Σ). Similar errors are: Surely the Companie could have beene content If they could but have found any president M Surely the Companie would have beene content If they could but have found any president Σ (45) (original) (a) Jack Vaughan and Porter and divers others 46 (b) Jack Vaughan with Porter and divers others HnE (c) Jack Vaughan and Porter with divers others Σ (16) (original) In the last example, (a) is probably derivative because one and attracted the other. It is probable that (c) is more original than (b) because of its occurrence in independent witnesses MHaSC. Thus (b) is a transposition. However, this argument hangs on the assumption that MHaSC do not derive from the same faulty ancestor. Considering this variant in isolation. we could just as reasonably conclude that the ancestor of HnE46 read as in (b) and had the original reading. But in the light of all the previous evidence, (c) is more probably original. In the examples of directional variation, M and Ha most frequently have original readings, and neither SC alone nor 46HnE alone have original readings; only when they agree with M or Ha do they contain such variants. An editor puts special weight on the variants of format of the poem, because there the argument for original readings is irreversible. Therefore M and Ha stand closer to the archetype, and we can resolve some of the ambiguities of the distributional formula. Trees (D), (E), and (F) are out of the question, for no manuscript has a significant number of original readings among its type 1 variants. Trees (B) and (C) are not likely to be right because M and Ha do not have a prominent enough position in them, and CS, which have no original readings alone, are given undue weight. Therefore tree (A) is the best. Such a tree surely relegates the printed text (46) to an inferior position; but that does not solve all the preliminary problems of an editor, because it is still uncertain which manuscript, M or Ha, has the shorter line of transmission. In other words, which manuscript should be the copy-text for a critical edition? This is a difficult choice, for both seem equally distant from the archetype. Greg has shown that the copy-text is most important for the texture of its accidentals, and an editor should choose the one that offers the best chance of bearing some of the details of the author's manuscript. In our case, neither M nor Ha shows any significant signs of authorial copy immediately behind the scribal transcription. The scribe of M is amazingly uniform in details of spelling and punctuation whether he is copying Suckling or Waller or Godolphin's poems, and the text of "The Witts" shows no deviation from his established patterns. Ha is a little more flexible in his practice, but when he does deviate from his habits while transcribing "The Witts," he moves farther than ever from Suckling's spelling. Suckling writes doe , goe , so , no ; whereas the scribe of Ha writes doe , goe , soe and noe more frequently in this poem than elsewhere. M seems to have more examples of Suckling's favorite past participate ending -nd , -vd , -rd , -md , -sd , and more examples of parenthesis in exclamations, direct address, and asides; however the scribe does the same thing in the rest of M. Both M and Ha have a small number of type 1 variants and both appear many times among the "shared" readings on the distributional chart. Thus it seems like a toss-up between the two. The only substantial difference between them is that M appears to be more of a professional job, neater, less prone to literal errors, more regularly punctuated, and generally cleaned up; while Ha is more naive, prone to simple omissions and misreadings, messy, and unprofessional. An editor of a critical text would surely want to favor readings from Ha, if for no other reason than the obviousness of its errors. As it has been often observed, all other things being equal, a messy and careless copy is less likely to have deliberate improvements by a scribe than a highly professional transcript. But the final decision rests with the accidentals: which of the two agrees more with Suckling's known habits? Again Ha has an advantage, by a ratio of forty-eight to twenty-one; therefore Ha is the most suitable basis for an edition. Before the final editing, we must ask about the mixed text of the poem in Fragmenta Aurea 1648. Whence did its twenty-two corrections come? None of the six type 1 variants appear to be original, and some are clearly corrupt; for instance, hyde bound for hard bound (35) and what made for how came (57). Once it agrees with Ha alone: betwixt for ' twixt (72), an insignificant expansion. Once it agrees with HnE alone, cheared for cleared (115); and twice with S, himself scarce for himself hardly (56) and to any for any (118). The other twelve variants correct type 1 readings in 46, including the stanza omitted in 46, and they bring the text into general agreement with the manuscripts. Consequently the corrections may have come from a comparison of 46 with a manuscript closely related to S, itself possibly conflated with HnE. Another possibility is that 46 was compared against two manuscripts, one similar to S and one to HnE. There is not enough evidence for either case. At any rate, the text of 48 is considerably better than 46, but one of the ironies of textual transmission is that 48 was reprinted only in the surreptitious edition of 1672(?) and in Merry Drollery 1661. Whereas the corruptions of 46 were perpetuated in Suckling's works of 1658, 1694-96, 1709, 1766, 1770, and 1836. Nor were the mistakes rectified by W. C. Hazlitt's editions of 1874 and 1892, nor in A. H. Thompson's "standard" edition of 1910, which whimsically followed 1646 for a while, then 1648, and once picked up the erroneous reading hide bound (35) from 1648. Hazlitt and Thompson did not even notice that 48 supplied the missing stanza. The only modern edition which contains a substantial number of the corrections of 48 is that by R. G. Howarth in Minor Poets of the Seventeenth Century (1931). But since Professor Howarth was unfamiliar with the manuscripts, he could not know the importance of seven variants in 48, nor could he know of the twenty-six corruptions in both 46 and 48. In the little edition below, I have followed Ha except where a possibly better reading could be found in other witnesses (if I could explain how Ha fell in error). I have silently modernized u, v, i, j, and long s; expanded abbreviations, italicized proper names, and supplied capital letters at the beginning of lines. In the notes I have recorded only the substantive and semi-substantive variants from sources that could descend directly from the archetype, readings in Ha, M, the ancestor of CS, and the ancestor of 46EHn. 11 Clearly derivative readings from witnesses placed lower on the tree are omitted; thus the reader will not find type 1 variants from C, S, 46, 48, Hn, and E, because such a reading was apparently introduced by a copyist. And although I have altered the accidentals at several points, I have left a complete record of these changes for a full-dress critical edition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE WITTS 1. A Sessions was held the other day, And Appollo himselfe was at it (they say); The Lawrell that had been soe long reserved Was now to be given to him best deserved. And Therefore the witts of the towne came thither, Twas strange to see how they flockt together, Each strongly confident of his owne way Thought to carie the Lawrell away that day. 2. There was Selden and he sate hard by the chaire, Wainman not farre off, which was very faire, Sands with Townsend , for they kept noe order, Digbye and Chillingworth a little further, And There was Lucans translater too, and hee That makes god speake soe bigg in's poetree, Selwin and Waller , and Berkeleys both the brothers, Jacke Vaughan and Porter with divers others. 3. The first that brake silence was good old Ben , Prepared before with Cannarie wine, And he told them plainly he deserved the bayes For his were caled workes where others were but plaies, And Bid them remember how hee had purged the Stage Of errors that had lasted many an age, And he hop't they did thinke the Silent-woman , The Fox and the Alchymist out done by noe man. 4. Appollo stopt him here, and bid him not goe on, 'Twas merit he said and not presumption Must carie it: at which Ben turned aboute And in great Choler offered to goe out, But Those that were there thought it not soe fitt To discontent soe ancient A witt, And therefore Appollo called him back againe And made him mine host of his owne new inne. 5. Tom Cary was next but he had a fault That would not well stand with a Laureate, His Muse was harde bound and the issue of's braine, Was seldome brought forth but with trouble and paine. And All that were present there did agree A Lawreats muse should be easie and free; Yet sure twas not that, but twas thought that his grace Considered he was well hee had a Cupbearers place. 6. Will . Davenant ashamed of a foolishe mischance That he had got latly travelling in France Modestlie hop't the hansomnes of's muse Might any deformitie aboute him excuse; And Surely the Companie would have beene content If they could but have found any president, But in all theire records either verse or prose There was not one Laureate with out a nose. 7. To Will Berkeley sure all the witts ment well But first they would see how his snow would sell; Will smiled and swore in theire judgments they went lesse That concluded of merit uppon successe. Soe Sullenly takeing his place againe, Hee gave way to Sellwin that straight stept in, But (alas) he had beene soe lately a witt That Appollo himself hardly knew him yet. 8. Toby Mathew (pox ont, how came he there) Was busilie whispering sombody i'th eare, When he had the honnour to be named i'the Court, But Sir you may thanke my Lady Carlile for't, For Had not her Charecter furnished you out With something of handsome with out all doubt, You and your sorrey Lady Muse had beene In the number of those that were not to come in. 9. In hast two or three from the Court came in, And they brought letters (forsooth) from the queene, 'Twas discreetly done too for if they had come With out them th'ad scarce beene let into the roome. This Made a dispute for 'twas plaine to be seene Each man had a mind to gratifie the queene, But Appollo himself could not thinke it fitt, There was difference he said twixt fooling and witt. 10. Suckling next was called but did not appeare, And straight one whispered Appollo in's eare That of all men liveing he cared not for't; He loved not the Muses soe much as his sport, And Prized black eyes or a luckie hitt At bouls above all the trophies of witt, But Appollo was angrie and publikely said Twere fit that a fine were set on his head. 11. Wat Mountague now stood forth to his triall And did not soe much as suspect a deniall; Wise Appollo then askt him first of all If he understood his owne Pastorall, For If hee could doe it, 'twould plainly appeare He understood more then any man there And did merit the bayes above all the rest, But the Monsceure was modest, and silent confest. 12. Dureing these troubles in the Croude was hid One that Appollo soone mist, little Sid ; And haveing spied him, called him out of the thronge And advised him in his eare not to write soe stronge. Then Murry was summond but 'twas urged that he Was cheif allredie of Another Companie. 13. Hales set by himself most gravely did smile To see them about nothing keep such a coyle; Appollo had spied him but knowing his mind Past by and called Faulkland , that sat just behind; But Hee was of late soe gone with divinitie That he had all most forgot his poetree, Though to say the truth (and Appollo did know it) He might have beene both his preist and his poet. 14. At length whoe but an Alderman did appeare, (At which Will Davenant begann to sweare) But wise Appollo bid him draw nigher, And when he was mounted a little higher, Hee Openly declared that 'twas the best signe Of good store of witt to have good store of coyne, And without a sillable more or lesse said He put the Laurell on the Aldermans head. 15. At this all the witts were in such a mase That for a good while they did nothing but gaze One upon another, not a man in the place But had discontent writen great in his face. Only The small poets cleared up againe Out of hope (as 'twas thought) of borrowinge, But sure they were out for he forfetts his Crowne When hee lends any poet about the towne. Copy text Ha.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes I wish to express my appreciation to the Research Committee of the University of Virginia for aid in the publication of this essay. 1 I have not followed the theories of Paul Mass in Textual Criticism (1958) or J. Burke Severs' "Quentin's Theory of Text Criticism," English Institute Annual 1941 (1942), pp. 65-93, especially their assumption that they know from the beginning which are the erroneous readings; nor have I used the metacritical principles of Edwin Wolf II in "'If shadows be a picture's excellence': An Experiment in Critical Bibliography," PMLA , LXIII (1948), 831-857, or J. B. Leishman in "You Meaner Beauties of the Night," The Library , 4th ser., XXVI (1945), 99-121, or Roger Bennett in The Complete Poems of John Donne (1942). Mr. Leishman explicitly denies that any "mechanical or scientific method will enable an editor to decide which readings are corrupt and which are authentic" when he finds variants in manuscript miscellanies. In his unpublished Oxford dissertation, Mr. T. S. Clayton undertook an analysis of the texts of each of Suckling's poems, but he based his test on the first printed edition. 2 I am indebted to Mr. T. S. Clayton for calling this manuscript and Harvard 703 to my attention. Mr. Clayton also allowed me to examine his unpublished dissertation submitted to Wadham College, Oxford, in which he came to different conclusions about the relationships of the witnesses. Mr. W. H. Bond kindly checked readings in the Harvard manuscript. 3 T. S. Clayton, "Sir John Suckling and the Cranfields," TLS , (Jan. 29, 1960), p. 68. 4 Mr. R. W. Hill, Keeper of Manuscripts, New York Public Library, generously supplied the above information, but he thinks that, although the handwriting has some similarities with that of Halliwell-Phillipps, the manuscript is probably older, early rather than mid-nineteenth century. 5 For further evidence of corruption in Fragmenta , see my article, "The Canon of Sir John Suckling's Poems," SP , LVII (1960), 492-518. Thorn-Drury first noticed Fenton's remark; see T. S. Clayton, "Thorn-Drury's Marginalia on Sir John Suckling," N&amp;Q , n.s., VI (1959), 148-150. 6 Transcripts of the letters are in Berry, op. cit. and an additional letter in Clayton's "Sir John Suckling and the Cranfields." 7 The symbol Σ, invented by Greg, refers to the rest of the manuscripts other than the ones specified. 8 Letters and Dispatches of Thomas Earl of Strafforde , II (1740), 114, in a letter dated October 9, 1637. P. H. Gray, op. cit. , argues convincingly that Garrard is talking about Suckling's poem. 9 C omits there . 10 Perhaps the term "old native meter" describes the rhythm more accurately: two strong beats on either side of a caesura, with a varying number of unstressed syllables. The most frequent foot in the meter is anapestic. 11 The original idea for an apparatus which distinguished variants from texts near the top of the tree from those at the bottom of the tree was suggested by Mr. Clayton, who will explain his valuable new ideas on apparatus criticus in a future article.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">John Partridge and the Company of Stationers by Richmond P. Bond</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Partridge, the successful London astrologer and almanac maker who entered his fame during the latter years of the seventeenth century, was in 1709 brought before the Lord High Chancellor by the Worshipful Company of Stationers in a significant suit which concerned monopoly in publishing. Early in the reign of the first James the Stationers had obtained royal grants for the virtually exclusive rights of publishing almanacs, if allowed by the Church authorities, and by the end of the century these annuals were established as a kind of publication so popular that the profits therefrom were central to the business life of the Company. 1 This cheap booklet apparently offered the right mixture of instruction and innocent merriment to attract regular purchase by any man of city, town, or farm; here he might find such diverse matter as a Calendar, reference tables, entertaining prose and verse, forecasts, astrological lore, a budget of advertisements, and (if interleaved) space for scribbled memoranda. The seventeenth century produced two thousand titles and issues of almanacs by three hundred writers, and the total figures for distribution are estimated at three to four million copies. 2 Among Partridge's predecessors or rivals as astrological compilers were Andrews, Booker, Coley, Dove, Gadbury, Lilly, Pond, "Poor Robin," Rider, Saunders, Swallow, Tycho and Vincent Wing, and many another astrologer with a public devoted to his special kind of almanac, full of husbandry or commercial aids or facetious matter, or offering the standard wares fashioned in his individual mode. Not infrequently an almanac was so well esteemed that its author's name continued to appear on its title page long after his death. These ephemerides had a place, positive and negative, in the history of the Enlightenment, 3 and the charlatan as astrologer naturally found his way into the works of the satirists in several genres of the period. By the time Anne ascended the throne almanacs had taken sure rank in the progress of the printed word as one of the most profitable, influential, indicative, and interesting types of profane publication, and John Partridge had become the leading almanac maker. 4 The industrious Partridge published miscellaneous readings of the stars, engaged in public quarrels with other pseudo-scientists, claimed to have a medical degree, sold purging pills, and cast nativities for private patients. In his almanac, Merlinus Liberatus , his prognostications courted the obvious and equivocal, all in solemn phrase, so it was natural that the master of precise imprecision should be chosen for the principal role in one of the truly distinguished hoaxes in the history of satire. Setting out to expose the mischief of astrology, Jonathan Swift made the prominent astrologer-quack the butt of his irony. Under the putative authorship of Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq. he published the Predictions for the Year 1708 , in which he specifically foretold the death of John Partridge, and on the appointed day Swift brought forth a paper stating the fulfillment of this special prediction, which Partridge answered in his next almanac with a serious protest that he was still alive and had been alive all the time. Town wits joined in the flimflam by replying to Bickerstaff or by venturing further predictions in his name, and in April of 1709 Richard Steele adopted the popular nom de guerre for the editor of the Tatler , enlisting Partridge as a gambit and Bickerstaff as a periodical eidolon. This was all very tiresome for Partridge especially since his ill fortune had not been completely of his own making. In the summer of 1709, however, the astrologer found himself in further trouble—this this time with the powerful Company of Stationers and this time a difficulty which he had clearly brought on himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Court of Chancery Year after year Partridge's work as a maker of almanacs had been following the pattern usual among his kind. The astrologer prepared an annual pamphlet for the Company of Stationers, receiving a flat fee for his copy, and after the material had been allowed by the representatives of the Church the Company proceeded under royal prerogative to arrange for printing and distribution at a profit. The sales of almanacs and certain kinds of books accounted for most of the Company's revenue, which was used for the expenses of the corporation, charities, and excellent dividends. 5 In 1709 Partridge attempted to negotiate with the Stationers for an increase in his fee but received no satisfaction from that shrewd organization. He then withheld the Merlinus Liberatus from its normal and legal publication and sold the text of his 1710 compilation to John Darby, a member of the Company who had printed some of his early almanacs. No doubt under this arrangement Partridge received a sum greater than the amount expected from the Stationers. When Partridge and Darby decided to become independent of the authority of the Company, it quickly sought justice for its special privileges and initiated a suit in the Court of Chancery. 6 At a private meeting on 7 July 1709 the Court of Assistants of the Stationers' Company, the governing body of the corporation, considered "some matters in Difference between the Company and D r . Partridge Concerning his Almanack for the Year Ensueing," and a committee was ordered to meet with Partridge as soon as possible "to Accomodate and end the said matter in Dispute." On Saturday the 24th a letter from Partridge (presumably a statement of hopes and plans) to Mr. Churchill, a member of the committee, was read by the Court, and a larger committee was appointed to meet on the following Tuesday at two o'clock to examine the question. About this time the Company apparently made its decision to prosecute Partridge and Darby, and to act speedily. On 30 July upon petition of the Stationers as plaintiffs to the Master of the Rolls the two defendants were ordered to appear and answer the bill of complaint. Two days later the Court of the Company "Ordered that the Master and Wardens and whom else they shall think fitt do goe into such printing houses as they have reason to Suspect are printing any of the Companyes Coppyes or Almanacks to See whether they are printing any of the Companys Coppy's." Meanwhile the bill had been prepared in the customary repetitive detail. 7 This important document cited first the privilege granted by the Crown in letters patent, notwithstanding which "within these Two Months last past He the s d . John Partridge hath fframed &amp; Compiled &amp; the s d . John Darby . . . hath Printed or Caused to be Printed or they or one of them are now Printing or Causeing to be Printed w th .in the Realme of Great Brittaine &amp; diverse Parts beyond the Seas upon their or one of their Account" great quantities of an almanac for 1710 by Partridge and other almanacs by Fowle and Turner. Such a printing at home or abroad by individual members of the Company on their own account and without the authority of the Company was against the letters patent; authorized printing should be carried out by printers appointed or approved by officers of the Company, "managed &amp; Carryed on by a Comon Stock deposited by the s d . memb rs . who were to have answerable propor&amp;c.ilde;ons of Advantage over &amp; besides w t . was so as afores d . limitted for the poor of y e . s d . Company." The plaintiffs offer "not to take the Advantage of any Penalty whatsoever" but desire complete information on all the transactions of the confederates concerning their fraudulent almanacs. They say that unless the complainants are supported the privilege and interests granted by the Crown "must otherwise be Defeated &amp; not only the s d . poor Widows &amp; Orphans must perish but others." They ask that the defendants and their "Confederates their Jorneymen Workemen Serv ts . &amp; Agents may be Injoyned . . . from Printing Importing binding Selling Publishing Vending uttering &amp; Bartering away all such Books Almanacks Sheet Almanacks &amp; all other Bookes Sheets or Papers wherein shalbe Inserted or Contained the Callend r . of &amp; belonging to your Orat rs . granted to them &amp; their P re decessors" by the letters patent. On the 5th of August counsel for the Company repeated the substance of the bill, gave in evidence the letter Partridge had written to Churchill, and prayed that an injunction be issued to prevent the publication of Partridge's almanac until he should answer the bill and the court make other order to the contrary, and the court agreed (P.R.O., C. 33/312/363). In the record of Company disbursements an entry of 8 August states that the Master and Warden (or Wardens) went to search Darby's house at the Oxford Arms, spending three shillings on the expedition, and that eight shillings threepence were consumed at the Queen's Head "on Patridges Affair." In the next two months no orders or decrees were issued save those to force the defendants to answer the bill of complaint (P.R.O., C. 33/ 312/ 469, 438-438v; 25 August, 10 September 1709). But with the approach of the season for the sale of almanacs the Company thought fit to publish an advertisement concerning the injunction, and on 3 October 1709 a notice was approved for printing in the newspapers. It appeared in the Post Boy , stating the fact of the prohibition by the Lord Chancellor and warning that the Company was "resolv'd to prosecute all such Persons that shall do any Act in Contempt thereof." 8 The advertisement ended with a notice of the days of publication for the forthcoming authorized almanacs. By this time the quarrel had got into the public domain. A minor periodical called the Whisperer , conceived in imitation of the Tatler and written by Bickerstaff's sister Jenny Distaff, took note of the affair. At the end of the first and probably only essay an incident is recorded of a man who escaped from his own wedding; the disappointed bride comes to Jenny for advice, and Jenny asks her what person can give a solution. Jenny goes on — She told me, she had some Thoughts of my Brother. I assur'd her, he car'd the least for Astrology, ever since Partridge had the Confidence to appear in Contradiction to his Art; and, animated by some malicious Fiend, imposes still on the Vulgar, notwithstanding the plain Proof of the Stationers Company, who are fully satisfied of the diabolical Illusion, by his unreasonable Demands for the next Year's Almanack; But they resolve to stand by their Patent, and make this Familiar submit, or hang him up in Chancery. 9 After some delay the Court of Chancery received the answer of Partridge and Darby (P.R.O., C. 33/ 312/ 448, 458; 13, 22 October 1709. C. 7/ 299/ 3; 27 October 1709), wherein it was admitted that before the exhibiting of the bill of the complainants Partridge had sold the copy of his 1710 Merlinus Liberatus to Darby and had granted him the right of printing the same for his own advantage, and that Darby had printed part of this almanac but not yet the whole of it. The defendants objected that the letters patent, so important to the plaintiffs' case, were not "sufficient in Law" to give the Company the right to exclude from the defendants their own publishing rights. They further claimed that their almanac had not been allowed by the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Bishop of London and therefore that the authority of the Stationers, by their own showing, to publish such almanacs as had been allowed by the church officials did not apply to the pamphlet in question. Partridge and Darby then humbly prayed "to be hence dismis't with their reasonable Costs and charges in this behalf wrongfully sustained." The case appeared in the Court of Chancery twice in the month of November (P.R.O., C. 33/ 314/ 9v, 30; 5, 28 November 1709). The defendants asked that they be permitted to print and sell the offending almanac under proper accounting during the period of legal delay, but it was ordered instead that the case be argued more promptly. The great hearing took place on 6 December 1709 before the Right Honorable the Lord High Chancellor, William Lord Cowper. 10 The arguments repeated much that had already been said and written. The validity of the letters patent was the principal point at issue, and it had great force and convenience. In the end his Lordship held with the accepted doctrine and ordered that the demurrer of the defendants be overruled. The decision for the Company of Stationers received immediate but brief and matter-of-fact reporting in the Supplement, Post Boy , and British Apollo , and was entered by Narcissus Luttrell in his private Relation . 11 But the most detailed account, and the only one with a turn of wit the time could relish, was that of Abel Boyer in his own Post Boy , which read in part as follows: The Council for the Company alledg'd, That they have a PATENT for Printing all Almanacks and Calendars, the same being first revised by his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury's Chaplains; to which Revisal, Mr. Partridge refusing to submit, the Company would not print his Almanack. On the other hand, the Council for Mr. Partridge insisted on his Natural Right, to have the disposal of his own Labours and Lucubrations: But my Lord Chancellor gave it for the COMPANY; who, by their Patent, have the sole Property of Printing all Calendars. Thus the Prophecy, of Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq; is, at last, accomplish'd: For, altho' Mr. Partridge may still be alive, as to his Animal Functions, yet he is, at present, Dead, quatenùs an Astrologer and Almanack-Writer ( Post Boy , by Abel Boyer, No. 2275, 8 December 1709). Partridge made public his own views in A Letter to a Member of Parliament from Mr. John Partridge, touching his Almanack for the Year 1710. and the Injunction, whereby the Publishing of it is staid for the present , a four-page, folio pamphlet dated 10 December 1709. This polemical epistle begins with a reassurance that the writer is not dead, "as you have been told in Print by a merry witty Gentleman under a feign'd Name," and that the "Injunction was not granted upon the Suggestion of my being dead, as some have foolishly imagin'd." The writer proceeds to give the historical background of the dispute and to reproduce and answer various arguments of the Company: the way people could be misinformed in almanacs written by ignorant men, the use of the Church Calendar, and the "mischievous consequence to the State" of prognostications by ill-affected astrologers. Partridge more than once makes plain his adherence to the principles of the Glorious Revolution and contends with much logic "That the Legislative Power of this Kingdom is not in the Crown ( alone ) but in the Crown, Lords and Commons" and that printers should not be restrained by a royal prerogative. All of this is clearly an appeal to Parliamentary authority against monopolistic privileges granted at the time of James I, "when Patents were growing in, and Parliaments growing out of fashion." The whole presentation is carefully reasoned, strongly and succinctly stated, and entirely different from the astrological works of Dr. John Partridge. Perhaps counsel wrote the pamphlet for him, but it appeared as if prepared by the defendant in the current suit and so must be associated with his name as a worthy document in the history of the liberty of the press. 12 With the new calendar year of 1710 Partridge and Darby submitted a further answer to the charges, repeating some of the points in the Letter and claiming that any pretended right of the plaintiffs was "a Matter cognizable and determinable at the Common Law." They denied that they had imported any almanacs, admitted they had had no license from the Company to print or sell almanacs, and protested that they were being prohibited "from the exercise of their lawfull Employm ts . for the maintenance and support of themselves &amp; their familys and for the enabling them to pay what is and shall be assessed and laid on them for and towards the publick taxes" (P.R.O., C. 7/ 299/ 3; 23 January 1710). The case reappeared in Chancery for several legalistic maneuvers, but the injunction remained operative (P.R.O., C. 33/ 314/ 213, 145v, 176, 295v; 23 January, 1, 9, February, 27 May 1710). On 22 February 1711 the whole business was thoroughly reviewed before the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, whereupon he ordered that a case be made upon the letters patent and two questions be stated — whether the grant given to the plaintiffs be general or restrained as to which almanacs must be allowed by the Church, and whether the Crown has the prerogative to grant exclusive power. The case would be referred to the Queen's Bench for opinions, which would be considered by the Lord Chancellor, who then would "proceed to give his finall Judgm t . in this Case" (P.R.O., C. 33/ 316/ 525-525v. Cf. C. 33/ 318/ 129v; 7 January 1712). And there the matter rested for more than sixty years — a period of delay beyond what might reasonably be expected of Chancery proceedings. In 1769 the great Lord Mansfield after a full study of the case commented as follows: Lord Harcourt afterwards heard the cause. He did not choose, in a case about almanacs, to decide upon prerogative. He therefore made a case of it, for the opinion of this Court; Lord Parker being then Chief Justice. This Court, so far as it went, inclined against the right of the Crown in almanacs. But, to this hour, it has never been determined: and the injunction granted by Lord Cowper still continues. 13 The rights and liberty of the British subject were not truly vindicated in the publication of almanacs until Thomas Carnan in 1775 won from the Court of Common Pleas the answers to the two questions propounded in 1711 — that the royal grant applied only to ecclesiastically approved almanacs and that the Crown had no power to grant exclusive rights. 14 In such a manner did a quack astrologer who wanted more money for his famous-infamous almanac pose the problem of an author's choice to publish his work wherever he pleased and not of necessity through the Stationers' Company, which had long been enjoying the profits of a monopoly awarded by a monarch with no concurrence by his legislature. Whatever the intention or status of Partridge he served as unwilling victim of an old inequity, and the suit against him has an interesting place in the history of legal challenge to official privilege. Though this suit was never determined and the liberty which Partridge claimed was not sustained until three score years after his actual death, it raised a pertinent issue and stated distinctly its central questions. By not being allowed to publish an almanac Partridge helped in a small way to create a better position for his successors. This official circumstance in Partridge's career has never received comprehensive study. A persistent and dogmatic error has prevailed that the Stationers struck the name of Partridge from their rolls, with perhaps the implication that the poor fellow was thereby forced out of employment. The Stationers have furthermore been credited with assuming Partridge to be dead or acting on that assumption by others. The more fanciful interpreters have maintained a kind of competition in artlessness, so that it becomes almost a sport to discover the best misunderstanding. For example, "The Stationers' Company gravely walked into the trap, and officially forbade the publication of further Almanacks bearing Partridge's name, because no one had a right to misuse the name of a dead writer." Or another: "In October 1708, the Stationers' Company published Partridge's almanack for 1709, in which also appeared a denial, but after this actually refused to issue any more of his almanacs on the ground that he was dead!" 15 This of course is nonsense. The Stationers had a patent to publish almanacs, which it was their wish, need, and habit to protect. When one of their most popular writers decided to withhold his work from their authority, they sought to prohibit him; if he successfully defied the organization, the Stationers would lose the profits of his annual publication and might lose also their power over other almanac makers. The Company did not strike Partridge from its roll of members — he was not a member and so could not be expelled; and the Stationers certainly were not striking him from their roll of astrologers but rather were trying to retain his almanac over their own imprimatur. The Stationers were not primarily interested in a hoax by a pseudonymous prankster or in a continuance of the joke by the town jesters, and they did not for a moment "assume" him dead. The Stationers were hardheaded men of business concerned with their own monetary matters, and they would hardly request an injunction against a ghost. A few people who were naïve or somber or ready to believe anything they read or heard doubtless accepted Partridge's "death" no matter what the source of the news. But in actuality the Bickerstaff predictions and the prominence Partridge received therefrom had no necessary connection with the legal action of the Company, unless we may suppose that Partridge thought the publicity he had been getting made his services more valuable. The groundless affirmations about Partridge and the Stationers in sober works by prominent scholars present a better than normal example of adherence to received legend and reluctance to consult solid sources. The story of Partridge in Chancery and his relation to the Stationers is interesting enough without recourse to scholarly romancing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harris the Pirate Related to the dispute between Partridge and the Stationers was Benjamin Harris, a prime rascal who spread his deeds over the several careers of author, printer, bookseller, journalist, pirate, and salesman. He spent a term of years in New England and by issuing in Boston the sole number of Publick Occurrences became in 1690 the "first American journalist." 16 Harris returned to London, where he acquired a very poor reputation in the trade as well as a degree of shrewd effectiveness. In the Merlinus Liberatus for 1706 Partridge warned the reader against "a Supplement added to my Almanack, forged and contriv'd by Benj. Harris and his Son, and Printed as mine, tho' I knew nothing of it till it was printed"; the next year he repeated his warnings against additions made by Harris to his almanac "either in the Middle or End of it." In February of 1708 the Company of Stationers filed a bill in Chancery against Harris and his sons Benjamin and Vavasour, all freemen of the Company, accusing them of subverting the letters patent "lately within these ffour Years last past" and particularly of printing the almanacs of Partridge and others for 1708, and prayed for an injunction restraining the Harrises from any unauthorized use of the Calendar (P.R.O., C. 5/ 270/ 20; 9 February 1708). In their joint answers the father admitted that he "did in his own Right &amp; sayd way of Trade print or cause to be printed in London some Thousands a Sheet Almanacks goeing under the borrowed Name of one Vincent Wing." 17 On 4 October 1708 the Court of the Company ordered its committee to advise with counsel and move the court for an injunction; the officers spent considerable time away from the Hall in conferences about Harris, with at least three on the 19th; and on the 21st the Lord Chancellor awarded an injunction against the unauthorized publication and sale by Harris of any more almanacs until the hearing (P.R.O., C. 33/ 310/ 490). On 18 November the Courant carried an advertisement announcing that Harris the bookseller had at his shop, the Golden Boar's Head in Grace Church Street, all kinds of almanacs for 1709 "Bound or Stitcht, Wholesale or Retale" and that annexed to the Partridge almanac there would be a printed list of the current members of Parliament at no extra cost. 18 After this, Harris apparently rested dormant for a year as an open enemy of the Stationers, or else crafty without record. 19 However, on 15 November of 1709, when the suit against Partridge was in full stride and the injunction in operation, the Courant had an advertisement of a Merlinus Liberatus for 1710 by J. Patridge, "Printed for the Author, and Sold by most Booksellers," etc. with no reference to Harris at all. Shortly a notice was published in the Post-Man that the Merlinus Liberatus by Patridge (again so spelled) had been published on the 24th "with an ALMANACK for the said Year, Printed by Allowance, and Conformable to an Injunction in Chancery," price bound 6 d. 20 On the 5th of December at a Court of the Company "A ffalse Almanack of Partridges was produced wherein is a Kallend r . and suspected to be Printed and Published by Benj a . Harris." The Stationers apparently knew Harris well, so the Master and Wardens were directed to investigate. Three days later the Court ordered that an advertisement concerning this publication by Harris of Partridge's almanac with the Company's Calendar "be put into the Gazett and several other publick News Papers," and also that advice be taken as to whether this action by Harris constituted a breach of the injunction against him. The proposed advertisement appeared in the Courant the next day to say that the Merlinus Liberatus was "pretended to be made by J. Partridge, but in Truth was patched together by Benjamin Harris (famous for Practices of this Nature)" and that there would be no almanac for 1710 by Partridge because of the injunction by the Lord Chancellor. This notice got wide distribution. 21 Later in the same month of December Robert Mawson, codefendant with Partridge and Darby in the Stationers' suit of 1709, bought copies of a sheet almanac from the Company's warehouse keeper and of the 1710 Merlinus Liberatus from Harris; he said in his formal answer to the charges of the Company that he had never to his knowledge disposed of any almanac "which had not been printed according to the said priviledge and having only bought a different Title containing noe part of a Calendar and therefore noe essentiall part of an Almanack, and for which hee humbly hopes if any person is Answerable it ought to be the said Benjamin Harris." 22 The method used by Harris is best described in a Chancery record of 28 November 1710. The counsel for the Stationers alleged: That the Def ts the Harris's the last year as alsoe this p res ent yeare have bought of the p ls . severall quantityes of their single Sheet Almanacks &amp; haveing putt them into four parts have paisted the said four parts being the whole Callendar with other Sheets p re sumed to be printed by them in a booke or Almanack intitled Merlinus Liberatus with an Almanack printed by allowance for the year 1711 under the name &amp; by (J Patridge) &amp; not Partridge the letter R being left out thinking thereby to evade &amp; elude the breach of the s d . Injun&amp;c.ilde;on. 23 At this time in 1710 the Stationers prayed that the injunction formerly granted be extended to enjoin Harris from publishing the Merlinus Liberatus by J. Patridge, and the Court of Chancery so ordered. 24 The clerk of the Stationers refused to register in the Hall Book the copy of the 1711 Merlinus Liberatus by Harris, and this refusal was publicly recorded. 25 The Company promptly disclaimed in print the new Merlinus Liberatus as published by Harris " with an Almanack printed by Allowance " and pretended to be written by Partridge; the Company further denied that Harris's almanac had been registered at Stationers' Hall, announced that the High Court of Chancery had granted an injunction prohibiting the printing and sale of the said book, and stated that there would be no almanac by Partridge for 1711. 26 A year later the Company again requested an extension of the injunction against Harris, this time to prohibit his printing three certain almanacs for 1712, and again Chancery so ordered (P.R.O., C. 33/ 318/ 49-49v; 10 December 1711). And when Partridge prepared a 1714 almanac for the Stationers entitled Merlinus Redivivus , he said he could not doubt "that those beggarly Villains that have scarce Bread to eat without being Rogues, two or three poor Printers and a Bookbinder, with honest Ben , will be at their old Trade again, of Prophesying in my name," and gave a similar warning in his almanac for 1715 without naming the offender. Such is the incomplete and varied evidence about Harris from the documents of Chancery, the records of the Stationers, and the advertisements in the periodic press. An additional archive of his piratical activity is the almanac itself that he succeeded in publishing, the Merlinus Liberatus for 1710 and 1711, copies of which have quite recently become known and now confirm what may be surmised from the official records. The title page of each of these two almanacs is a close imitation of that of the legitimate Merlinus , but the subtitle has been altered from "Being an ALMANACK" to "(With an ALMANACK Printed by Allowance.)" The compiler's name is spelled Patridge. Each almanac was "Printed for the Author," not for the Company of Stationers, and the 1711 pamphlet contradicted the statement of the Stationers about registry at the Hall with the claim that it had been "Register'd in the HALL-BOOK of the Company of Stationers, pursuant to Act of Parliament." The first three leaves and the last five contain matter, in verse and prose, of a sort common to almanacs of the time or to Partridge's anti-French diatribes. Between the miscellaneous features are six leaves in which one page is devoted to each month and filled with a few lines of verse, some "Monthly Observations," and for 1710 "Remarkable Occurrences this Month" chosen from previous years and for 1711 "An Astrological Judgment." The distinctive component is the Calendar. The year's quarters were cut from a folio sheet almanac, verso blank, of the kind that bore the name of Vincent Wing, and each section, measuring about 5 by 6½ inches, was folded down the middle and pasted at the folded edge to the inner margin of one of the three appropriate pages, i.e. in these copies the pages for the months of March, June, September, and November. The scissors and paste were clumsily applied, and the tipped-in portions are smaller than the book, so these factitious enterprises have a rather shoddy appearance. Obviously, Harris argued that by using a Calendar actually printed by allowance he might evade the injunction against his publication of the almanac. At the end of the 1710 Merlinus there appears this particularly interesting sentence, signed J. P.: "Whereas it has been industriously given out by Bickerstaff Esq. and others, to prevent the Sale of this Years Almanac that John Partridge is Dead: This may inform all his Loving Countrymen that (blessed be God) he is still Living, in Health and they are Knaves that Reported otherwise." Such an advice in this place provides of course no sign of participation by Partridge himself. Harris permitted only one use of his own name in the two pamphlets — in the 1711 almanac advertisements were entered for four items sold by him, one devotional publication and three nostrums. The manifest conclusion from these almanacs and from the official records is that Harris was certainly a nuisance to the Stationers. It is possible that his unauthorized work in 1708 or earlier somehow gave Partridge and Darby the idea, or strengthened the notion, of establishing the Merlinus Liberatus as their own property despite the Stationers' monopoly, but it is not likely that his work in 1709 came in time to influence such a decision. During the closing months of 1709, when Partridge was restrained by Chancery and the conditions in the almanac business were somewhat confused, Harris, who was already an experienced pirate, captured this special opportunity to use Partridge's name and the title of his almanac, and he repeated the performance the following year. Under legal restriction himself, he bought legally published sheet almanacs, from which he extracted the essential Calendar and attached it to other pertinent matter, gave the almanac the popular title of Merlinus Liberatus , and signed it with the name of J. Patridge, a name close enough to that of the eminent astrologer to cheat the careless or unlettered eye. Thus honest Ben employed a real title and a near-name to escape the court and turn a bad penny. We may be reasonably certain that no almanac prepared by Partridge and sponsored by the Company was issued for 1710 or 1711, and without further testimony we must suppose that Partridge had no hand in the juggleries of Benjamin Harris, a knave of all trades.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Partridge Redivivus During the months when the Chancery suit against Partridge was most active, when Mr. Bickerstaff was thriving as an editorial astrologer in the Tatler with Partridge still serving as an occasional target, and when Harris was contriving an illegal substitute for the proscribed ephemeris, the Stationers themselves elected to sponsor a new almanac which would perhaps take the place of the one stopped by the action of their suit. On 15 August 1709 the Warden spent several shillings "at y e Queens head with the Master &amp;c about y e Tatlers Almanack." Quite probably the high officers realized that the profit from Partridge's almanac was lost to them indefinitely and an anti-Partridge almanac might subtract from that loss. The plan was to produce not a tract mocking the almanac maker but an almanac itself, written under the name of Bickerstaff and continuing to ridicule the astrologer. This plot, or at least the title of the prospective pamphlet, 27 came to the notice of the Tatler's alert distaff rival, the Female Tatler , written by "Mrs. Crackenthorp, a Lady that knows every thing," who thus began her fiftieth issue on the last day of October 1709: From the Advantages I have over other People of knowing every Thing , I have this Opportunity put into my Hand of obliging the Publick with the Preface Mr. Bickerstaff has made to his Almanack for the succeeding Year; wherein you will find plain, that Mr. Partridge is dead, notwithstanding all the Noise made about him, so that the Company of Stationers might have spar'd the Charge of obtaining an Injunction against him, and prohibiting every body from Printing the said Partridges Almanack. Besides, it was easie for the said Mr. Bickerstaff from his Knowledge of Futurity, to foresee no body wou'd attempt to Print or Reprint his Predictions, because whoever shou'd must expect to incur the Penalty of the Company's Injunction. The all-knowledgeable lady then offers a preface she has somehow acquired; here Bickerstaff gives his reasons for considering Partridge dead and advances his own claims to see into all secret follies. A mediocre piece not worthy the signature of the male Tatler, or the female. A good fortnight later the proper Mr. Bickerstaff announced at the end of Tatler No. 94 that his almanac would appear on the 22nd of November and "from that Instant, all Lovers, in Raptures or Epistles, are to forbear the Comparison of their Mistresses eyes to Stars, I having made Use of that Simile in my Dedication for the last Time it shall ever pass." 28 After such an announcement, specific in date and content, we are prepared for the publication of Bickerstaff's Almanack . It did appear — and on schedule, we may presume, with the other seasonal booklets — and Steele's own prediction was fulfilled in its dedication to Urania, which obviously held no resemblance to the preface devised by Mrs. Crackenthorpe. The Situation of the Earth, the Force of Cælestial Bodies which move around it, as well as the different Stations they possess, and their various Influences on the inferiour Part of the Universe, are admirably well described in the Book which I herewith send you; wherein the Doctrine of the Plurality of Worlds is delivered in a plain but courtly Manner, at once to entertain the Imagination, and inform the Judgment, of an Intelligent Woman, with whom he feigns a Conversation. I urge his Authority for addressing an Almanack , as he does a System of Philosophy; and I acknowledge as great a Disproportion between the Merit of the Authors, as there is between the Value of their Works. These, Madam, are the Stars so often mentioned in my Epistles to you: and you will now see how justly your Eyes have been call'd such, by the Effect they have had on the Behaviour of their Beholders. When you consider the mighty Orbs and Worlds around you, it will encrease your Contempt of this little Life; but at the same Time, I hope it will add to the Enjoyment of it. . . . Have we here a new bit of frolicsome prose by Richard Steele? The allusion in the Wardens' Accounts to the "Tatlers Almanack," the warning in the Tatler against the forthcoming conceit of a mistress's eyes, and the style itself are consistent with an attribution of this dedication to the editor of the Tatler papers. This almanac was so unPartridgean that it had no prognostications at all but monthly observations of a horticultural character. It purported to be a vindication of the stars against the false assertions of the late Partridge and other mistaken astrologers, and it contained a sizable, sensible essay on almanacs proving "That the Art of Telling Fortunes, is an Imposture upon Innocent Persons by Mock-Astrologers and Gypsies " and twice naming Partridge. In a letter of testimonial about Partridge's death a Jeremy Wagstaff accused the astrologer (wrongly) of making a mistake in his prediction of a certain phase of the moon and then resorted to Swift's quibble that " No Man alive " could commit such an error. 29 The quality of the wit in the body of Bickerstaff's Almanack scarcely competes with that of the essays by the reigning Bickerstaff. 30 But this diversion in the controversy between Partridge and the Stationers raises questions. Did the Company design the almanac merely as a financial venture or as an experimental publication or only as a gesture against their forbidden writer? Did the Company contract with Steele to introduce and puff an almanac compiled by some hack astrologer? And who wrote the rational essay on prognostications? Among the early and inevitable imitations of the Tatler there appeared Titt for Tatt in March 1710, closely imitative in format, devices, and contents. Its writer was "Jo. Patridge, Esq.," who had not died after all but instead had "only made a Tour for Conversation amongst the Stars." His heavenly connections enabled him to find "a dreadful Fate hang over the Principal of the Family of the Staffs ." Report discovers Bickerstaff in a vault in Lincoln's Inn, and on a visit to the tomb 'Squire Patridge is told: For when Men of Parts have got their Ends, they naturally Lapse into the State of the Dead , and being pamper'd with Plenty, their briskness and vivacity of Ingenuity, from too great Indulgence of Luxury, suddenly Decays, and brings on 'em a fatal Stupidity, or Morosis , as the Physicians call it, so that in few Months they sleep Life away. Titt for Tatt was an amiable and able follower of the Tatler , here worth remark as making a neat turn of the tables by a fictive Partridge against his "Ingenious Brother Bickerstaff ." Meanwhile Partridge's name had also appeared over several pamphlets. In 1709 there was Mr. Patridge's Judgment and Opinion of this Frost , comparing the current visitation with the great frost of 1683. And during his rustication two twelve-page tracts for the times also exploited the fame of this prophetical Doctor with the syncopated name. The Right and True Predictions of Dr. Patridge's Prophecy For the Year 1712 gave monthly observations on affairs in general, heavenly data, and forecasts of weather, as well as facts on the quarters, eclipses, and terms, and contained two handy lists: a "Speculum" by Mrs. Dorothy Patridge "foretelling the Good and Bad Days" for love or marriage or travel or removing or business by assigning a single descriptive phrase, as "indifferent good" or "very good" or "lucky" or "dangerous," and so on, and a final section setting down the rates for hackney coaches and chairs to all parts of London. For the next year D r . Patridge's Most Strange and Wonderful Prophecy provided similar astrological judgments, but concluded with a list of the market towns in England and the day of the week "on which each of them are kept." The shade of Partridge was becoming a help to history. No almanac by Partridge appeared for the years 1710 to 1713, but late in 1712 the officials of the Stationers began holding conferences about him and early in 1713 about the peril of counterfeit almanacs. 31 In May the Court of the Company ordered a committee to meet with Partridge and Darby "in order to accomodate the matters in Difference." The astrologer, through a representative, insisted on £150 for a licensed almanac that year, with the allowance in succeeding years to be negotiated. The Stationers agreed to give £100 "for this yeare for his Almanack in Expectacon there will be a Considerable Sale thereof," and thereafter to consent to a reasonable settlement, with an umpire if necessary. Partridge accepted this compromise and thus quite probably got a larger sum than he had ever obtained before (Stationers' Court Book G: 14 May, 1 June, 7 September 1713). In the regular announcement by the Stationers of the publication of all the almanacs for 1714, Partridge's work received special note, "not having been printed these four Years last past" ( Post Boy , No. 2873, 8 October 1713). The injunction was of course still in force, but if the Stationers were ready to exploit their victory and found Partridge willing to reenter the ranks of their almanac makers, no one had cause to complain or demur. For his resumed work Partridge revived one of his old titles, Merlinus Redivivus , and again called himself "A Lover of Truth." The portion worthy of remark is a letter to Bickerstaff on the verso of the title page. This was the injured astrologer's first chance in five years to answer his adversary in an almanac, and it must be said that he responded with temperance. Perhaps his sobriety here came from a sincere forgiveness or the weakness of age, perhaps from a desire to squeeze the last bit out of popular remembrance of the affair. In his final words on the matter, nearly three years after the end of Steele's Tatler , Partridge addresses Steele through Bickerstaff and condemns Swift by name. There seems to be a kind of fantastical Propriety, in a Dead Man's Addressing himself to a Person not in Being. Isaac Bickerstaffe is no more; and I have nothing now to dispute with, on the Subject of his Fictions concerning me, sed magni nominis umbra , a Shadow only , and a mighty Name . . . . Now, Sir, my Intention in this Epistle, is to let you know, that I shall behave my self in my new Being with as much Moderation as possible, and that I have no longer any Quarrel with you, for the Accounts you inserted in your Writings concerning my Death, being sensible that you were no less abused in that Particular, than my self. The Person from whom you took up that Report, I know, was your Name-sake, the Author of Bickerstaffe's Predictions , a notorious Cheat. * And if you had been indeed as much an Astrologer, as you pretended, you might have known that his Word was no more to be taken, than that of an Irish Evidence, that not being the only Tale of a Tub he had vented. . . . For the next two years Partridge's ephemeris was called merely an Almanack with no distinguishing title, and bore the motto "Melius semel quam semper." Partridge died in 1715, but his almanacs for 1716 and 1717 carried the assurance that they had been "written with the Doctor's own hand." All of these almanacs were printed for the Stationers. The 1717 almanac took its title from Partridge's greatest success — the Merlinus Liberatus , now a completely appropriate phrase — and it held the perfect motto, "Etiam mortuus loquitur." This actually dead Partridge continued to speak for more than a century and a half, with timely alterations of method as well as material, and thus became the nearest rival to Old Moore in posthumous longevity. 32 For frequency of publication Partridge had outlived many of his more worthy critics, at least in the use of a name. 33</field>

References will be made by date to the minutes of the meetings of the Court of the Stationers in Court Book G, 1697-1717, and to the record of disbursements in the Warden's Accounts, 1663-1727.

M. Stationery Office. Of course, there had been earlier suits by the Stationers for their almanac patents, e.g. those against Lee and Marlowe in the reign of Charles II. Perhaps the most significant case was that of John Seymour; see particularly Blagden, Stationers' Company , pp. 193-195. 7 Public Record Office, C. 7/ 299/ 3; 2 August 1709. On 8 December 1709 the Stationers decided that Robert Mawson, book-binder, should be made a party to the action, and his name was by order of the court inserted in the original bill: C. 33/ 314/ 81v; 9 December 1709. Mawson appeared twice in later orders (C. 33/ 314/ 167v, 257; 18 February, 21 April 1710) and his answer was dated 29 April 1710 (C. 7/ 299/ 3). He was never a major figure in the case. 8 Post Boy, No. 2246 (6 October 1709).

Herbert Davis (1940), pp. 229, 231. 30 In Tatler No. 96 (19 November 1709) Bickerstaff ended his statement about true and worthy existence with an alleged note by Partridge once more informing the world he was alive, and introduced this repetition of the wellworn joke by calling these words by Partridge the conclusion to the "Advertisement of his next Year's Almanack." Steele or Addison could have known from the Courant of 15 November that the Merlinus Liberatus by J. Patridge was imminent. This reference in the Tatler may be only a part of the jest or an effort at ridiculing a potential rival of Bickerstaff's Almanack . Bickerstaff's name appeared also on numerous New England almanacs in the late eighteenth century, especially those by Benjamin West. 31 Wardens' Accounts, 1663-1727: 29 December 1712, 15 January, 4, 7 February 1713; 12, 13, 20, 24 January 1713 and later. Vide Dr. Sw — 32 The Merlinus Liberatus was, it seems, discontinued in 1871; the name of Francis Moore is still in vogue. 33 The undated Dr. Flamstead's and Mr. Partridge's New Fortune Book contained a method of telling fortunes by cards with answers in fifty-two poems and also treatises on palmistry, physiognomy, dreams, and moles. It is pleasant to record that the philomath was briefly returned to his career by George Beaton in Doctor Partridge's Almanack for 1935 . If this Partridge's purpose was denigration, "often of a rather uncertain and ill-directed kind, such as one would expect from a person who had spent so many years in retirement," we should recall that times have changed and Partridge was a lover of truth.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Fielding's Revisions of Joseph Andrews by Martin C. Battestin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Five editions of Joseph Andrews , Henry Fielding's first novel, were published by Andrew Millar during the novelist's lifetime. Although it could not match the extraordinary popularity of its rival, Pamela , the book was nonetheless an immediate success: the first three editions, together amounting to 6500 sets, were published in little more than a year, a supply sufficient to meet the demands of the public for five years before a fourth of 2000 copies, and, later, a fifth, again of 2000 copies, were required. 1 As nearly as can be determined, the dates of publication of these editions are as follows: (1) 22 February 1742; (2) 10 June 1742; (3) 21-28 March 1743; (4) 29 October 1748 [the title-page reads 1749]; and (5) 19 December 1751. 2 For the editor, or for any serious reader interested in establishing the definitive version of Joseph Andrews , the evolution of the text has special significance. An exacting critic and a responsible craftsman, Fielding was seldom satisfied with his own performance: he returned to his work with the artist's proud eye to polish and perfect. Each of the second and subsequent editions was revised and corrected. The title-page of the second edition only, however, which was enlarged and extensively reworked, bears the further legend, "with Alterations and Additions by the Author"; with the others, there is no such explicit assurance that Fielding authorized the changes that occur. The problem is complicated by the fact that even the sixth edition, appearing in the year of Arthur Murphy's edition of the Works (1762), was also announced as "Revised and Corrected," though it was published eight years after the novelist's death; and the same tag appears on the titlepages of the seventh and eighth editions. Which of these corrected texts is, then, authoritative? Previous editors who have bothered to ask this question have chosen the second edition as copy-text (though in practice they do not follow it very scrupulously), admitting later readings occasionally and with bewildering inconsistency. Aurélien Digeon's early essay on the text of Joseph Andrews , based on very careless collation, has been less than helpful: Digeon summarily disposed of the third and fourth editions, asserting that he had found only two slight corrections in each 3 —a hopelessly inaccurate count that might well discourage any editor from troubling himself with them. But, though there is little in them to compare with the major revisions of the second edition, these texts abound with minor alterations of phrasing and punctuation, some of which are quite significant. On the other hand, changes in the fifth edition are noticeably less frequent, and they are consistently, and suspiciously, less striking. My own count of separate instances of substantive changes in these editions — excluding alterations of punctuation and paragraphing, and all obvious printer's errors — is as follows: in B , 311; in C , 163; in D , 112; in E , 47. Because of qualitative differences — individual interpolations in the second edition amounting at times to passages from one to several pages in length — the discrepancy between B and the other editions is even more marked than these numbers would suggest. In order to facilitate analysis and to furnish a convenient record of the more significant revisions, a full sampling of the textual variants is appended to this essay. A glance at these will illustrate the differences more vividly than any abstract description; and, what is more, it should reveal that Fielding's own hand was at work in much, though certainly not in all, of the "revising and correcting" of the third and fourth, as well as of the second, editions. Important corroborative evidence to this effect is found in certain of the advertisements for these editions. Notices for the fourth edition which Millar ran in The General Advertiser include this helpful statement, prominently displayed: " The Fourth Edition. Revis'd and Corrected by the Author." 4 Just why that last crucial phrase should have been omitted from the title-page and from the advertisement carried in The Jacobite's Journal is puzzling, since it would doubtless have promoted the sale of the edition. Perhaps Fielding felt that the changes were inconsiderable (which, in comparison with those he made for the second edition, they certainly are), and did not therefore wish to mislead the public. In any case, the ascription of the revisions to him contained in The General Advertiser is quite explicit and deliberate. Clearly, Millar wished to have it known that the changes in the fourth edition had Fielding's authority; and his declaration is supported by the nature of several of the revisions, which, though brief, are too striking to be dismissed as the work of some careless compositor (see, for example, Textual Notes 2, 16, 21, 73, 86, 101, 104, 105, 111, 120, 123, 126, 127). 5 Similarly, although the original advertisements are silent regarding the authorship of the revisions in the third edition, notices carried more than two years later in Fielding's own True Patriot bear this significant description: "The Third Edition: Revised and Corrected with Alterations and Additions by the Author." 6 Even without this confirmation, substantive alterations in the edition would seem admissible, since many of them reveal an author's care (see, for instance, TN 10, 46, 66, 76, 83, 87, 88, 93, 96, 102, 103, 110, 117, 122, 128), and since they are incorporated into the authoritative fourth edition. With perhaps two curious exceptions (see TN 14, 100), 7 emendations in the fifth edition are very likely not to be trusted: they are too slight and insignificant, and suggest the work of a compositor, or some printing-house editor. In the case of a writer as conscious of his craft as Fielding, textual analysis has a special value: it affords one of the surest avenues to that final objective of criticism, the close and intimate knowledge of the work of art, its method and its meaning. Although, under the pressures of earning a living as lawyer and hackney author, Fielding seems to have composed hurriedly — a supposition that accounts for the several minor inconsistencies of detail that still survive in his novels — he nevertheless thought long and seriously about the art of fiction. Joseph Andrews, Tom Jones, Amelia , were carefully planned and constructed from the start, and no less carefully polished in revision. Notwithstanding their humbler mode and subjects, they were, after all, of the epic genre, and he gave them the attention due to the highest of the literary kinds. Though it is ultimately the shape and spirit of the finished work that matter, an examination of the novel in process can tell us much about Fielding's craftsmanship and his purpose. Analyzing the text at the point of revision, we come as close as possible to the writer at the moment of composition — smoothing or sharpening his style, breathing the breath of life into scene and character, whetting the edge of his satire. Of the more than six hundred substantive variants that occur through the fifth edition, a majority are of little interest to any but the most curious bibliographer. Many — and this is especially true of the fifth edition — may be confidently attributed to the compositor, and many more result from the effort to correct grammar and smooth syntax, the usual business of proof-reading. Of the extensive changes introduced into the second edition, and of the later, less substantial revisions, however, many are of a more general interest for the light they shed on Fielding's art and on his thematic intentions. There were the inevitable slips of the pen to set right, and a few colorless sentences to retouch in the interests of style. What is more important, missing from the novel as it first appeared were a number of its most humorous and skillful passages. Whole facets of the memorable figure of Parson Adams, Fielding's greatest achievement in characterization, and of Mrs. Tow-wouse, as well as lively strokes in the depiction of almost every other major character — and, indeed, at least one amusing portrait in its entirety — were lacking; long, dramatic passages at the beginning and end of the central narrative were as yet unwritten, leaving those crucial structural positions unrealized; and ridicule of the clergy, lawyers, and politicians was underdeveloped. At times as slight as a word or phrase, or as full as a page or more, these meaningful " Alterations and Additions " require separate classification and commentary. 8 Despite his revisions, Fielding caught only a handful of the errors which attended the rapid composition of Joseph Andrews . The "Erratum" prefixed to the first edition, for example, called attention to the "Mistake" made in Book III, Chapter 6, where Adams is said to have missed two nights' sleep, an error corrected in the second edition (TN 1, 95). Although one instance remains of the failure to remember that the Christian name of Lady Booby's husband was Thomas and not John (I, 11), Fielding duly rectified two others in revision (TN 11, 37). Similarly, in the second edition Fanny calls her rescuer and fellowservant by his proper name, this time John and not Thomas (TN 108). An alteration in the fourth edition corrects the misnaming of Le Sage's Dr. Sangrado, until then called Sanglardo (TN 73). Readers still uncertain about the number of volumes of Parson Adams' sermons will be relieved to learn that while the inconsistency remains (I, 15), a change in the fourth edition reveals Fielding's intention (TN 21). Another "error" was allowed to stand despite the carping of some very dull critics, Fielding adding a long and humorous footnote defending himself from a certain "Orator" and a faction who publicly misunderstood an amusing passage in which Adams praises Mr. Wilson for his learning (TN 81). These emendations, however, were not enough to eliminate all the errors and inconsistencies of that first hasty writing. 9 A number of minor, miscellaneous alterations may be considered together. Several name changes are curious: thus it appears that Leonora's friend was originally Howella rather than Florella (TN 41); that Justice Frolick first was Trolick (TN 117); and that before he was kidnapped from his rightful parents, Joseph Andrews' name was Jacky Wilson (TN 91). Other variations between the first and second edition assist the annotator. The addition of a footnote, for instance, enables us to infer that Leonora's letter to Horatio was the work not of Fielding, but (in all likelihood) of his sister Sarah, soon to publish an epistolary volume of her own (TN 40); and by the inclusion of an adjective, Fielding places his reader on surer ground in identifying another allusion as "long" Sir Thomas Robinson (TN 98). 10 Examination of the texts, however, seems to invalidate a previously accepted identification, assumed by both de Castro and Dudden: 11 It is unlikely that, in adding in May 1742 a long and important passage to the second edition (TN 57), Fielding would have intended his ignorant parson's recollection of "'a Nobleman who would give a great deal of Money'" for Adams' Æschylus as a reference to the antiquarian Edward Harley, second Earl of Oxford, whose death on 16 June 1741 would make such an allusion out of date by nearly a year. While too vague to justify a specific inference, other changes leave us with the suspicion that Fielding intended a particular reference: for example, the interpolation in the account of the unprincipled constable, Tom Suckbribe (TN 17). Incidental revisions calculated to inject a measure of humor and life into a passage are also frequent: typical are alterations as slight as that in the heated altercation between Betty and the truculent Mrs. Tow-wouse (TN 23), or as substantial as the inserted argument for divisions in authors (TN 27). A change may clarify motive, explaining the innkeeper's disdain of Adams (TN 49) or Fanny's willingness to accept the favor of Mrs. Wilson's bed (TN 80); or it may briefly sharpen and emphasize a statement essential to an important theme, for instance, the rare and exalted nature of true love (TN 39). Revisions such as these will suggest the kinds of information to be derived from even the most casual of the alterations. As one might expect, much of the incidental retouching was for the sake of style — for correctness, clarity, color of expression. As Hercules Vinegar, editor of The Champion , Fielding had hauled Colley Cibber before the bench of the Court of Censorial Inquiry on the charge of murdering the English language; and during the course of his satirical panegyric on the passion of Love in Joseph Andrews (I, 7), he had resumed the attack: not "the Great Cibber , who confounds all Number, Gender, and breaks through every Rule of Grammar at his Will, hath so distorted the English Language, as thou dost metamorphose and distort the human Senses." In revising his own work, he took pains not to be guilty of the same offence: we find him smoothing rough edges (TN 10, 59, 89, 102, 126, 127); clarifying vague expressions (TN 12, 19, 29, 42, 54, 90, 101, 124); improving transitions (TN 3, 16, 69, 70), or the precision of his words (TN 46, 76, 85, 87, 88, 94, 110, 120, 123, 128), or the logical order and emphasis of his constructions (TN 66, 93, 105, 119); avoiding clumsy repetitions (TN 18, 83); deleting unnecessary words (TN 96, 103, 111). It will appear that incidental emendations such as these are especially characteristic of the great majority of the revisions made for the third and fourth editions. Somewhat more interesting, improvements in paragraphing or clarity, say, at times provide further opportunities for the display of some of Fielding's favorite stylistic devices — the rhetorical question, or exclamation, or parenthesis — used for emphasis and to heighten the comedy (TN 74, 30, 26). 12 A change as slight as that in the account of the "Ladder of Dependence," gaining balance and antithesis of phrase as a means of stressing the relative nature of "greatness," illustrates Fielding's skill in the functional adjustment of sound to sense (TN 61). One of the surest signs of the master stylist, he chooses precisely the right verb to evoke a vivid image of Parson Trulliber's gait (TN 63), or to enliven the scene of Adams' "roasting," this time with a word more appropriate to the usual business of the pranksters (TN 99). Another stroke completes the almost symbolic association between the dogs that harass the parson and the human curs who accompany them (TN 97). But Fielding's good judgment in detecting and correcting weaknesses in his story is superbly manifest in the extensive recasting of the important transitional episodes (II, 2, and III, 12) that open and close his central narrative, relating the journey of his heroes from the Dragon Inn towards the parson's country parish. It was Fielding's keen sense of drama and proportion that dictated the interpolation of two new scenes to replace the perfunctory expository passages of the original version. In the first edition a few lines explained Adams' decision to return to his cure with Joseph: the sermons he hoped to publish in the Great City had been left behind (TN 31). For the second edition, Fielding took advantage of the comic potentialities of the situation by depicting at length Joseph's discovery that the manuscripts were missing and Adams' subsequent bewilderment and resolution (complete with scholarly quotation and Christian moralization) to abandon his journey to London. And we are shown as well an early instance of the friendship, founded on affection and respect, between parson and parishioner: Joseph offering to undertake the long journey home to fetch the sermons, and Adams as thoughtfully refusing to inconvenience his friend. The parson's motivation remains the same, but Fielding has enriched both the humor and the humanity of his story, dramatically heralding the adventures of his heroes on the road. Balancing this episode, the substantial four-page addition in III, 12, is even more striking (TN 113). With the central movement of his odyssey nearing a close, Fielding wisely set about the task of rewriting, both to achieve a certain symmetry in the architecture of the novel and to effect a gradual and dramatic, rather than abrupt, lowering of the curtain. With respect to the progress and structure of the narrative, in Book III, Chapter 12, the stage is being prepared for the successful termination of the quest, the joyful entrance of the principals into Adams' parish and the marriage of Joseph and Fanny to follow. The journey is virtually over. The forces opposing the arrival of the three pilgrims at their destination have been thwarted by the rescue of Fanny from her abductors and her reunion with Joseph and the parson; and with the appearance of Peter Pounce, Lady Booby's steward and representative, who heralds her own imminent arrival on the scene, the paths of the antithetical elements of the story — the lady and her worldly company and the trio of virtuous wayfarers — have crossed. Having here brought his antagonists face to face, in Book IV Fielding will happily resolve the symbolic conflict between them. The end of this chapter thus occupies a pivotal position in the organization of the plot; for the last chapter of Book III, the dialogue between Adams and Pounce (opposing types of good nature and greed) has as its chief purpose the final articulation of the major theme, the doctrine of charity, and only secondarily contributes to the linear progress of the story. As Fielding originally wrote it, the close of Chapter 12 was far too weak to satisfy the requirements of structure: his central narrative had to be concluded on a pitch in keeping with its importance, and preparations had to be made for the arrival of the company at Lady Booby's country seat. The first skeletal draft contained the essentials: the placing of the characters for the final stage of the journey — Pounce and Adams in the chariot and Joseph and Fanny on the parson's horse — is swiftly accomplished and, incidentally, becomes the occasion for a further instance of Adams' forgetfulness and Fanny's devotion. The revised version breathes the vitality of dramatic immediacy, of comic action and dialogue, into these dry bones, and its greater length functions, again dramatically, to heighten suspense by avoiding a too rapid transition, skillfully delaying the shift to Booby-Hall and the denouement. The uproarious confusion of the preparations for the trip is not simply reported as before, but represented as on a stage, visually and aurally. Occasioned by the good nature of Joseph and Adams, the impasse (newly added to the story) as to who will ride the parson's horse is interspersed with Adams' sesquipedalian speech and underscored by Fielding's amusing digression, contrasting the sham courtesy of polite society. Reasons for the resolution of the difficulty are given: Pounce's pride and the parson's natural complaisance. Added, too, is the comic incident of the further delay caused by Adams' half-starved horse balking under the double burden of Joseph and Fanny. Fielding's skillful craftsmanship, the sense of drama and construction learned through a decade of play-writing, could scarcely be better demonstrated than by a comparison of the original and revised versions of this episode. The effort to impart a fuller measure of life and humor to his characters further accounts for a number of changes. For the minor figures, an occasional stroke of the brush is usually sufficient. In the second edition, for example, Betty the chambermaid, offended and upset by Mrs. Tow-wouse's insults, stutters in self-defense (TN 24), a comic device previously used by Fielding in Shamela . In two other instances, Leonora betrays her vanity, the principal theme of her story (TN 43, 47), and the francophile Bellarmine reveals that he is a member of the turncoat Opposition (TN 44). Brief touches are added to the memorable portrait of Parson Trulliber: he "stalks" like a goose (TN 63); he drinks ale rather than cider (TN 64); his "extremely broad" accent, especially his difficulty with the word call , is spelled out (TN 65); and his hypocrisy in professing, but not practicing, the Christian virtues of piety and charity is made explicit (TN 67, 68). The ale-house keeper, formerly a seafaring man, adds a salty phrase of affection for his lost ship (TN 71). As for Pamela, the change of a word in the third edition — she speaks of herself as the "Lady" rather than the "Wife" of Squire Booby — further exposes her vanity (TN 122). Already remarked in the discussion of the major revision in III, 12, Peter Pounce's appetite for a pretty girl and his pride are now the reasons for his desiring first Fanny and then Adams to share his coach (TN 113); elsewhere in the same chapter, a word is enough to point up the pleasant mask he wears (TN 110), or that notoriety which he shared with his original, the miser Peter Walter of Stalbridge Park (TN 109). The second edition makes Mr. Wilson's appreciation of Adams' learning more apparent (TN 79), doubtless for the benefit of those obtuse critics who had earlier missed the fun as the parson, flattered by Wilson's compliments, praises him for his wide reading and good judgment (TN 81); and the fourth renders less severe Wilson's relief at the death of a jealous mistress (TN 86). A further touch in Wilson's biography aptly provides the elderly man of honor with a great hat and a long sword (TN 82); another makes the coquetry of Sapphira more sophisticated (TN 84). The popular rage for the Grand Tour, elsewhere satirized in Bellarmine and the "roasting" squire, is also ridiculed as Fielding retouched the portrait of the Italianate traveler, emphasizing his sham dignity (TN 52) and filling his speech with ill-digested scraps of his favorite language (TN 51, 53). Of the minor roles, only the formidable figure of Mrs. Tow-wouse was much altered in revision, but here the changes were substantial. Besides the usual slight strokes — the character of her chin (TN 14), her profanity (TN 23), or the "Serenity" of her temper (TN 25) — Fielding added whole passages in which her termagancy, hypocrisy, avarice, and ill-nature are heightened (TN 15, 33, 34, 35). One method he used was to transfer to Mrs. Tow-wouse several uncharitable remarks spoken by her husband in the first edition, thereby reinforcing the reader's sense of her inhumanity and her domination over her well-meaning but spiritless spouse, in whose mouth the words had been out of character. Similarly, the principal roles were filled out and brightened in revision. For example, the preposterous pedantry and malapropisms of Mrs. Slipslop were accented (TN 6, 62, 114, 121). With typical reluctance to own her affection for Joseph, Fanny now coyly misunderstands her abductor's gibes about her fondness for a footman; in the original version she had frankly confessed her love (TN 107). Although primarily intended as a criticism of predatory politicians, another lengthy interpolation depicts her fears as she stands in the darkness of the Downs alone with Adams, as yet unknown to her (TN 55; see also TN 56). Several revisions — the most important of which we have already noticed (TN 31, 113) — affect the characterization of Joseph: his morals, for instance, are sounder than those of the authors of "good Books" (TN 4); in apparent ridicule of Pamela , he resists his temptress "out of Tenderness for his Virtue" (TN 8); and later his bravery and selfless devotion to Fanny are briefly underscored (TN 77). With a further alteration, calling him Joseph rather than Joey (TN 9), Fielding keeps his promise to sustain the important thematic analogy between the situation of his hero — "whom for a good Reason we shall hereafter call Joseph" (I, 5) — and that of his biblical namesake, who also withstood the blandishments of an ardent mistress. Slight changes emphasize Lady Booby's affected indignation at some innocent liberties Joseph had taken with the servant girls (TN 7) and her more honest rage at his "Tenderness for his Virtue" (TN 8). Two more substantial revisions point up her imperiousness and vanity, piqued by Adams' declaration that Fanny was the "handsomest Woman" in the parish (TN 115, 116): the first interpolation provides a further instance of the lady's exasperated repetition of the word "Beauties," which runs through her speech as a kind of comic leitmotif; the latter, by adding the element of her displeasure with Lawyer Scout, whose legal gibberish is beyond her, prepares us as well for the fine comedy of her quick reversal in attitude once Scout has flattered her vanity by aspersing the character and beauty of her rival. Inevitably, the largest proportion of the revisions went toward the perfection of Parson Adams. Some of the most memorable features of this unforgettable portrait were blurred or missing when it first appeared. In two major interpolations already discussed (TN 31, 113), Fielding dramatized Adams' absentmindedness, his piety and good nature, his bookish speech and his preference for "'the Pedestrian even to the Vehicular Expedition.'" Many other alterations are minor — quick, vivid strokes of the brush: in the Wilson episode, the parson reveals himself as a connoisseur of good beers (TN 92); details such as the shortness of his great coat (TN 36) and the length of his beard (TN 112) or of his legs, so necessary to his horsemanship (TN 48), are brought out, as well as his poverty, obliging him to borrow a horse from his clerk (TN 32) and eliciting the scorn of an inn-keeper (TN 49); and his characteristic benevolence, "visible in his Countenance" (TN 55), will not let him expose the ignorance of the clergyman who had contemptuously abused him before the justice (TN 58). Conflicting revisions in the second and fourth editions have to do with Adams' ability to keep the secrets of his superiors, the lack of which virtue in Richardson's Pamela and Arthur Williams had annoyed Fielding: although he later corrected Adams' tendency to discuss publicly the ignorance of the squire (TN 2), at another time the parson's prolixity was made to get the better of his good intentions as he openly deplores Lady Booby's conduct with Joseph (TN 38). Elsewhere, Adams' innocence of the ways of this world leads him to suppose that he can strike a better bargain with the bookseller if he confesses the urgency of his needs (TN 22). Several new passages illustrate his impressive learning and scholarship: Latin and Greek, for example, roll readily from his tongue, and he quotes Theocritus to demonstrate the instability of earthly fortunes (TN 31); the shamelessness of a notorious Corinthian courtesan affords the aptest analogy to the self-assurance of Leonora (TN 45); together with its sheepskin binding, his Æschylus, we are told, was the affectionate work of his own hands (TN 57, 60); and his enthusiastic recital of the Iliad "almost frighten'd the Women" in Mr. Wilson's parlor (TN 79). In this regard, the most extensive interpolation augments the parson's impromptu criticism of the Iliad : to prove his claim that Homer's chief excellence is "'in the pathetic,'" he prefers Andromache to the Tecmessa of Sophocles, who is in turn placed above Euripides and Seneca as the best of the tragedians (TN 78). Finally, two considerable additions exemplify Adams' piety and his impractical Christian-Stoic idealism: occurring in the consolatio to Joseph, who is frantic with grief at the abduction of Fanny, the first sounds a conventional theme of Christian consolatory literature, the duty of submission to a benevolent Providence (TN 106); 13 the second (TN 125), in which the parson rather wilfully distorts a text from Matthew in order to admonish Joseph against the lust of the flesh (the verse pertains to adultery, not conjugal love!), is a further instance of Adams' theoretical contempt of the passions and a superb example of his author's comic irony. Indeed, there could scarcely be a better demonstration of Fielding's mastery of his craft, of his keen critical eye and creative powers, than his deft retouching of the portrait of Parson Adams, each new stroke bringing that remarkable figure closer to perfection, until he stands forth at last complete and alive, one of the supreme triumphs of art. No less interesting as indications of Fielding's thematic intent are several changes affecting the satire of the novel. Many of the revisions adduced in the discussion of characterization might, of course, equally apply here: Mrs. Tow-wouse or Trulliber or the Italian traveler fit neatly into the scheme of "the true Ridiculous" that Fielding set forth in his Preface. In a number of places, however, he gave himself to the castigation less of particular human failings than of folly and vice within the institutions and professions of society. Parenthetically, for example, he scoffed at those "very sagacious Critics" who spun out absurdly fanciful theories about the composition of Homer's epics (TN 28); or at greater length he ridiculed those politically biased historians (topographers he preferred to call them) who wilfully perverted their facts, producing romance rather than true history (TN 72). In several substantial passages he mocked with bitter irony at the law and its practitioners. In one, describing the ill-natured rector of Adams' parish and his ruinous litigation with the tenants of the manor (TN 5), Fielding sardonically compared the consequences of the states of Civil War and Civil Law, briefly raising an issue that would later occupy Dickens at length in Bleak House . Another, even more extensive interpolation — again combining satire of the law and clergy — exposes the ignorance of the country justice and his clerk, who darkly construe Adams' Æschylus as a ciphered document in a plot against the government (TN 57). Later, Fielding heightened the severity of his sketch of the pettifogger Scout by further revealing his fondness for legal jargon and his casuistry, circumventing the plain intent of the law (TN 116); and Scout next flatters his patroness by blackening the character of her rival (TN 118). Perhaps most significant, however, is Fielding's reinforcement of one of the novel's prominent themes: his fictional continuation of the campaign begun in The Champion to correct a prevalent contempt of the clergy. 14 In Abraham Adams, pilgrim, patriarch and priest, whose faith is forever proved through his charitable offices and works, Fielding gives us the good clergyman, heroically maintaining the true religion in a benighted world badly in need of him; in some half-dozen other clergymen — all of them worldly, incompetent, corrupt — he exposes for correction those really responsible for that contempt of their order which was undermining the cause of religion and morality. Returning to his novel, he intensified the satire of the clergy, adding, in fact, an entirely new portrait to the small gallery of false priests already exhibited. Brief changes, for example, point up the pride of Barnabas (TN 20) and, his mind crowded with thoughts of the punch bowl below stairs, his perfunctory ministrations to the soul of Joseph (TN 13). As we have seen earlier, other strokes clarified the hypocrisy of Parson Trulliber or sharpened the outlines of his characterization. A sizable addition to the account of Adams' rector, impoverishing his parishioners in a legal dispute over a modus, rendered more vivid his greed, ill-nature, and vindictiveness (TN 5). Finally, the important interpolation inserted into the trial scene in Book II, Chapter 11, brought to the novel still another ignorant and arrogant clergyman, who treats Adams with contempt while pronouncing his Æschylus "'A Manuscript of one of the Fathers. . . the Catechism in Greek '" (TN 57). Two other changes are most interesting, both as examples of Fielding's satire of unprincipled politicians and as part of the pattern of his own shifting political loyalties. In what stands as the most valuable contribution of his early essay on the text of Joseph Andrews , Digeon was the first to observe these implications in the revised opening to Book II, Chapter 10, where Fielding flicks his lash at the double-dealing, predatory members of the Patriot Opposition. 15 Elsewhere I have argued that Fielding's disillusionment with his former party was not the sudden result of the change of ministries in February 1742, but that it began much earlier, probably with his defection from The Champion in June 1741. 16 The new attitude is clearly evinced in his satirical allegory, The Opposition: A Vision (December 1741), and it is present as well in the first edition of Joseph Andrews , where Fielding's own unhappy experiences with the Opposition inform the political parable of Parson Adams' encounter with the cowardly patriot and are vicariously represented in the hypocrisy and ingratitude of those place-hunting members of the Country Party who used Adams for their own ends and then abandoned him (II, 7-9). As he revised the novel in the spring of 1742, Fielding sharpened this satire. In a passage that Digeon overlooked, the affected francophile Bellarmine, who despite the serious decline in the English woolen industry refuses to "'trust any thing more than a Great Coat to an Englishman ,'" now reveals himself as a member of the turncoat Patriot Party: "'before I had a Place, [he confesses to Leonora] I was in the Country Interest, he, he, he!'" (TN 44). Even more pointed is the major interpolation at the beginning of Book II, Chapter 10, where Fanny, in the dark not recognizing Adams, who has just rescued her from a rape, fears "as great an Enemy in her Deliverer, as he had delivered her from." Here Fielding draws an unmistakable analogy between the situation of his heroine and that of England in 1742, rid of the corruption of Walpole, but newly exposed to the ambition of Pulteney, Carteret, and the other self-seeking Patriots who had deposed him: "she suspected he had used her as some very honest Men have used their Country; and had rescued her out of the hands of one Rifler, in order to rifle her himself" (TN 55). Through at least four editions, then, though most notably in the second, Fielding worried over his first novel — shaping and polishing it with a craftsman's careful hand, bringing his story and his people even more brilliantly to life. Style, scene, structure, characterization, satire — there is scarcely an aspect of the book that did not receive his attention in revision. Offering much useful information about Fielding's habits of composition, his techniques and intentions as a writer, the textual analysis of Joseph Andrews brings us unusually close to the novelist in the process of creation, an advantage that not even the most attentive reading of the finished work can afford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Textual Notes The following notes provide a full sample of the more than six hundred substantive variants that occur among the editions of Joseph Andrews published by Andrew Millar during Fielding's lifetime. All of the major revisions are recorded, but only a selection of the more significant minor changes could be adduced. In each case, only the first instance of a substantive revision is transcribed; variants in the "accidentals" and sometimes in phrasing may occur in later editions. A complete history of the text must await the publication of the projected Wesleyan edition. Included in each note are references (1) to the book and chapter of Joseph Andrews wherein the revision occurs, and (2) to the volume and page (or signature) of the edition in question. Chapter numbers are given according to the corrected third edition; minor typographical errors have been silently emended. The five editions are designated, respectively, by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. The following illustration will furnish a key: 113.

To mention therefore but one which is most obvious, it prevents spoiling the Beauty of a Book by turning down its Leaves, a Method otherwise necessary to those Readers, who, (tho' they read with great Improvement and Advantage) are apt, when they return to their Study, after half an Hour's Absence, to forget where they left off. These Divisions have the Sanction of great Antiquity. 28. II.1: A (I,135) but hawked them all separately, B (I,135) but, according to the Opinion of some very sagacious Critics, hawked them all separately, 29.

II.2: A (I,137) This Accident was no other than the forgetting to put up the Sermons, which were indeed left behind; B (I,137) This Accident was, that those Sermons, which the Parson was travelling to London to publish, were, O my good Reader, left behind; 31. II.2: A (I,137) who thought her Husband would want Shirts more than Sermons on his Journey, had carefully provided him. The Bill was now called for, and on Examination, amounted within a Shilling to the Sum which Mr. Adams had in his Pocket. B (I,137-9) who thought her Husband would want Shirts more than Sermons on his Journey, had carefully provided him. This Discovery was now luckily owing to the Presence of Joseph at the opening the Saddle-Bags; who having heard his Friend say, he carried with him 9 Volumes of Sermons, and not being of that Sect of Philosophers, who can reduce all the Matter of the World into a Nut-shell, seeing there was no room for them in the Bags, where the Parson had said they were deposited, had the Curiosity to cry out, "Bless me, Sir, where are your Sermons?" The Parson answer'd, "There, there, Child, there they are, under my Shirts." Now it happened that he had taken forth his last Shirt, and the Vehicle remained visibly empty. "Sure, Sir," says Joseph , "there is nothing in the Bags." Upon which Adams starting, and testifying some Surprize, cry'd, "Hey! fie, fie upon it; they are not here sure enough. Ay, they are certainly left behind." Joseph was greatly concerned at the Uneasiness which he apprehended his Friend must feel from this Disappointment: he begged him to pursue his Journey, and promised he would himself return with the Books to him, with the utmost Expedition. "No, thank you, Child," answered Adams , "it shall not be so. What would it avail me, to tarry in the Great City, unless I had my Discourses with me, which are, ut ita dicam , the sole Cause, the Aitia monotate of my Peregrination. No, Child, as this Accident hath happened, I am resolved to return back to my Cure, together with you; which indeed my Inclination sufficiently leads me to. This Disappointment may, perhaps, be intended for my Good." He concluded with a Verse out of Theocritus , which signifies no more than, that sometimes it rains and sometimes the Sun shines . Joseph bowed with Obedience, and Thankfulness for the Inclination which the Parson express'd of returning with him; and now the Bill was called for, which, on Examination, amounted within a Shilling to the Sum Mr. Adams had in his Pocket. 32.

This caused Mr. Tow-wouse 's Eyes to water, and he told Joseph , he did not conceive a Man could want Money whilst he had Gold in his Pocket. B (I,141-2) the less ready at an Expedient to extricate himself. Tow-wouse was willing to give him Credit 'till next time, to which Mrs. Tow-wouse would probably have consented (for such was Joseph 's Beauty, that it had made some Impression even on that Piece of Flint which that good Woman wore in her Bosom by way of heart.) Joseph would have found therefore, very likely, the Passage free, had he not, when he honestly discovered the Nakedness of his Pockets, pulled out that little Piece of Gold which we have mentioned before. This caused Mrs. Tow-wouse 's Eyes to water; she told Joseph , she did not conceive a Man could want Money whilst he had Gold in his Pocket. 34.

B (I,142) "nor to redeem it from a Robber, would I part with this dear Piece," answered Joseph . "What (says Mrs. Tow-wouse ) I suppose, it was given you by some vile Trollop, some Miss or other; if it had been the Present of a virtuous Woman, you would not have had such a Value for it.

II.5: A (I,186-7) the Parson, who was accustomed to it, and threw himself forward on such Occasions B (I,187) the Parson, who was accustomed to it, and as his Legs almost touched the Ground when he bestrode the Beast, had but a little way to fall, and threw himself forward on such Occasions 49. II.5: A (I,188) At which the Host scornfully repeating the word Betters , flew into a Rage, B (I,189) At which the Host, (having first strictly surveyed Adams ) scornfully repeating the word Betters , flew into a Rage, 50.

The Coachman began now to grow importunate 54. II.6: A (I,206) he made his Escape in a Minute, B (I,206) he made his Escape from that Subject in a Minute, 55. II.10: A (I,229) Whilst Adams was wisely weighing in his Mind the Objections which might be made to either of these two Methods of proceeding, his Judgment sometimes inclining to the one and sometimes to the other; B (I,229-30) The Silence of Adams , added to the Darkness of the Night, and Loneliness of the Place, struck dreadful Apprehensions into the poor Woman's Mind: She began to fear as great an Enemy in her Deliverer, as he had delivered her from; and as she had not Light enough to discover the Age of Adams , and the Benevolence visible in his Countenance, she suspected he had used her as some very honest Men have used their Country; and had rescued her out of the hands of one Rifler, in order to rifle her himself. Such were the Suspicions she drew from his Silence: but indeed they were ill-grounded. He stood over his vanquished Enemy, wisely weighing in his Mind the Objections which might be made to either of the two Methods of proceeding mentioned in the last Chapter, his Judgment sometimes inclining to the one, and sometimes to the other; 56. II.10: A (I,230) at which the Woman testified some Fear, but Adams said, "Be of good cheer, Damsel, B (I,230) at which the Woman testified some Fear, (for she had concealed her Suspicions of the Parson himself,) but Adams said, "Be of good cheer, Damsel, 57. II.11: A (I,243) "—So make haste with his Mittimus ." One of the Company having looked stedfastly at Adams , asked him, "if he did not know Lady Booby ?" B (I,243-5) "—So make haste with his Mittimus ." The Clerk now acquainted the Justice, that among other suspicious things, as a Penknife, &amp;c. found in Adams 's Pocket, they had discovered a Book written, as he apprehended, in Ciphers: for no one could read a Word in it. "Ay," says the Justice, "this Fellow may be more than a common Robber, he may be in a Plot against the Government. —Produce the Book." Upon which the poor Manuscript of Æschylus , which Adams had transcribed with his own Hand, was brought forth; and the Justice looking at it, shook his Head, and turning to the Prisoner, asked the Meaning of those Ciphers. "Ciphers!" answer'd Adams , "it is a Manuscript of Æschylus ." "Who? who?" said the Justice. Adams repeated, " Æschylus ." "That is an outlandish Name," cried the Clerk. "A fictitious Name rather, I believe," said the Justice. One of the Company declared it looked very much like Greek . " Greek !" said the Justice, "why 'tis all Writing." "Nay," says the other, "I don't positively say it is so: for it is a very long time since I have seen any Greek . There's one," says he, turning to the Parson of the Parish, who was present, "will tell us immediately." The Parson taking up the Book, putting on his Spectacles and Gravity together, muttered some Words to himself, and then pronounced aloud—"Ay indeed it is a Greek Manuscript, a very fine piece of Antiquity. I make no doubt but it was stolen from the same Clergyman from whom the Rogue took the Cassock." "What did the Rascal mean by his Æschylus? " says the Justice. "Pooh!" answered the Doctor with a contemptuous Grin, "do you think that Fellow knows any thing of this Book? Æschylus! ho! ho! ho! I see now what it is. —A Manuscript of one of the Fathers. I know a Nobleman who would give a great deal of Money for such a Piece of Antiquity. —Ay, ay, Question and Answer. The Beginning is the Catechism in Greek . —Ay, —Ay, — Pollaki toi —What's your Name?"—"Ay, what's your Name?" says the Justice to Adams , who answered, "It is Æschylus , and I will maintain it."—"O it is," says the Justice, "make Mr. Æschylus his Mittimus . I will teach you to banter me with a false Name." One of the Company having looked stedfastly at Adams , asked him, "if he did not know Lady Booby ?" 58. II.11: A (I,245) Mr. Adams should sit down and take a Glass with him. As for Fanny , B (I,246-7) Mr. Adams should sit down and take a Glass with him; and the Parson of the Parish delivered him back the Manuscript without saying a Word; nor would Adams , who plainly discerned his Ignorance, expose it. As for Fanny , 59. II.11: A (I,246) "each contending, they two only had been the Competitors on whom my Election would have fallen.

II.15: A (I,281) but was reputed a Man of great Charity.

III.1: A (II,2) every Reader believes as he pleases, but all agree in the Scene, where it is supposed to have happen'd. Now with us Biographers the Case is different, B (II,2-3) every Reader believes as he pleases, and indeed the more judicious and suspicious very justly esteem the whole as no other than a Romance, in which the Writer hath indulged a happy and fertile Invention. But tho' these widely differ in the Narrative of Facts; some ascribing Victory to the one, and others to the other Party: Some representing the same Man as a Rogue, while others give him a great and honest Character, yet all agree in the Scene where the Fact is supposed to have happened; and where the Person, who is both a Rogue, and an honest Man, lived. Now with us Biographers the Case is different, 73. III.1: A (II,3) the Country of Dr. Sanglardo , D (II,3) the Country of Dr. Sangrado , 74.

He ran into the most extravagant Encomiums on his Learning, and the Goodness of his Heart began to dilate to all the Strangers. He said he had 80.

I have however, notwithstanding this Criticism which I am told came from the Mouth of a great Orator, in a public Coffee-House, left this Blunder as it stood in the first Edition. I will not have the Vanity to apply to any thing in this Work, the Observation which M. Dacier makes in her Preface to her Aristophanes: Je tiens pour une Maxime constante qu'une Beautè mediocre plaire plus generalement qu'une Beautè sans défaut .

III.12: A (II,162) Mr. Pounce was desirous that Fanny should continue her Journey with him in the Chariot, and she absolutely refused, being determined to ride behind Joseph , on a Horse which one of Lady Booby 's Servants had equipped him with. (This was indeed the same which Adams had left behind him at the Inn, and was by these honest Men who knew him, redeemed:) if any means could be contrived of conveying Mr. Adams with them; whose Company Pounce , when he found he had no longer hopes of satisfying his old Appetite with Fanny , desired in his Vehicle. So that all matters being settled to the Content of every one, Adams and Pounce mounting the Chariot, and Fanny being placed on a Pillion, which Joseph borrowed of the Host, they all set forwards for Booby-Hall , B (II,160-3) Mr. Pounce was desirous that Fanny should continue her Journey with him in the Chariot, but she absolutely refused, saying she would ride behind Joseph , on a Horse which one of Lady Booby 's Servants had equipped him with. But alas! when the Horse appeared, it was found to be no other than that identical Beast which Mr. Adams had left behind him at the Inn, and which these honest Fellows who knew him had redeemed. Indeed whatever Horse they had provided for Joseph , they would have prevailed with him to mount none, no not even to ride before his beloved Fanny , till the Parson was supplied; much less would he deprive his Friend of the Beast which belonged to him, and which he knew the moment he saw, tho' Adams did not: however, when he was reminded of the Affair, and told that they had brought the Horse with them which he left behind, he answered — Bless me! and so I did . ADAMS was very desirous that Joseph and Fanny should mount this Horse, and declared he could very easily walk home. "If I walked alone," says he, "I would wage a Shilling, that the Pedestrian out-stripped the Equestrian Travellers: but as I intend to take the Company of a Pipe, peradventure I may be an Hour later." One of the Servants whispered Joseph to take him at his Word, and suffer the old Put to walk if he would: This Proposal was answered with an angry Look and a peremptory Refusal by Joseph , who catching Fanny up in his Arms, aver'd he would rather carry her home in that manner, than take away Mr. Adams 's Horse, and permit him to walk on foot. Perhaps, Reader, thou hast seen a Contest between two Gentlemen, or two Ladies quickly decided, tho' they have both asserted they would not eat such a nice Morsel, and each insisted on the other's accepting it; but in reality both were very desirous to swallow it themselves. Do not therefore conclude hence, that this Dispute would have come to a speedy Decision: for here both Parties were heartily in earnest, and it is very probable, they would have remained in the Inn-yard to this day, had not the good Peter Pounce put a stop to it; for finding he had no longer hopes of satisfying his old Appetite with Fanny , and being desirous of having some one to whom he might communicate his Grandeur, he told the Parson he would convey him home in his Chariot. The Favour was by Adams , with many Bows and Acknowledgments, accepted, tho' he afterwards said, "he ascended the Chariot rather that he might not offend, than from any Desire of riding in it, for that in his heart he preferred the Pedestrian even to the Vehicular Expedition." All matters being now settled, the Chariot in which rode Adams and Pounce moved forwards; and Joseph having borrowed a Pillion from the Host, Fanny had just seated herself thereon, and had laid hold on the Girdle which her Lover wore for that purpose, when the wise Beast, who concluded that one at a time was sufficient, that two to one were odds, &amp;c. discovered much Uneasiness at his double Load, and began to consider his hinder as his Fore-legs, moving the direct contrary way to that which is called forwards. Nor could Joseph with all his Horsemanship persuade him to advance: but without having any regard to the lovely Part of the lovely Girl which was on his Back, he used such Agitations, that had not one of the Men come immediately to her Assistance, she had in plain English tumbled backwards on the Ground. This Inconvenience was presently remedied by an Exchange of Horses, and then Fanny being again placed on her Pillion, on a better natured, and somewhat a better fed Beast, the Parson's Horse finding he had no longer Odds to contend with, agreed to march, and the whole Procession set forwards for Booby-Hall , 114.

IV.3: A (II,185-6) "we ought to have an Act to hang or transport half of them." "Truly," said the Lady, "they are a grievous Load, and unless we had an Employment for them, it would be Charity to send them where they might have something to do. At least, I am sure we ought to prevent the farther Growth of the Evil, and not let such Beauties as these produce Children for us to keep."—"Beauties indeed! your Ladyship is pleased to be merry," B (II,185-6) "we ought to have an Act to hang or transport half of them. If we can prove in Evidence, that he is not settled in Fact, it is another matter. What I said to Mr. Adams , was on a Supposition that he was settled in Fact; and indeed if that was the Case, I should doubt."—"Don't tell me your Facts and your ifs ," said the Lady, "I don't understand your Gibberish: You take too much upon you, and are very impertinent in pretending to direct in this Parish, and you shall be taught better, I assure you, you shall. But as to the Wench, I am resolved she shall not settle here; I will not suffer such Beauties as these to produce Children for us to keep."—"Beauties indeed! your Ladyship is pleased to be merry," 117.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The ledgers of Henry Woodfall and William Strahan, printers for Millar, furnish valuable information about the printing of Joseph Andrews . See P. T. P., "Woodfall's Ledger, 1734-1747," N&amp;Q , 1st S., XI (2 June 1855), 419; and J. Paul de Castro, "Fieldingiana," N&amp;Q , 12th S., III (November 1917), 465, together with the "Bibliographical Note" to de Castro's edition of Joseph Andrews (1929). De Castro, however, misread the date of Strahan's entry for the printing of the fifth edition, which was through the press in April 1751, not 1750. 2 The following is a correct account of the publishing history of the first five editions, which, as given in Cross, de Castro, and Dudden, is both incomplete and inaccurate: (1) Advertisements heralding the publication of the first edition on Monday, 22 February 1742, were carried in The Champion (Feb. 11, 13, 16, 18, 20) and in The Daily Post (Feb. 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17). The novel was duly announced in The Daily Post for February 22 as published that day; The Champion , which was not issued on Mondays, carried the notice on Tuesday the 23rd. (2) Although the second edition was not listed in The Gentleman's Magazine and The London Magazine until August 1742, it had been announced in The Daily Post for Thursday, June 10, and in The London Evening Post for June 12-15 as published on those days; since the edition was through Woodfall's presses by May 31, a date of publication in June is quite likely. (3) Fixing a precise date for the third edition is more difficult. During the week of Tuesday, March 15, to Saturday, March 19, 1743, The General Evening Post promised that the edition would be published " On Monday next " (i.e., on March 21); publication was accordingly announced in both The General Evening Post and The St. James Evening Post (not published on Mondays) for Tuesday, March 22-Thursday, March 24. But the same pattern of advertisements was followed in The London Daily Post, and General Advertiser exactly one week later: the numbers for Friday and Saturday, March 25 and 26, declare that the edition will be published "On Monday next" (i.e., on March 28), on which date publication is duly noticed. Since the third edition was through Strahan's presses by February 20, a date of publication on either March 21 or 28 could be correct. Given this inconsistency, it is impossible to fix the date any more narrowly; it is tempting, however, to follow The Daily Post , which began advertising publication on March 24 and carried daily announcements for a week thereafter. This date would agree, in part at least, with those of The General Evening Post and The St. James Evening Post . (4) After a week-long fanfare in the pages of The General Advertiser , the publication of the fourth edition was announced in that journal on Saturday, 29 October 1748. Curiously, Fielding's own Jacobite's Journal did not carry the advertisement until a week later, Saturday, November 5. (5) Timed to appear simultaneously with Amelia , the fifth edition reached the bookstalls on Thursday, 19 December 1751 (see The General Advertiser for that date). Notice began in The London Daily Advertiser a day later. 3 Digeon, Le texte des romans de Fielding (Paris, 1923), p. 60. 4 The General Advertiser carried notices of the edition both before and after, as well as on, the date of publication, 29 October 1748: see the numbers for October 22, 24—29, 31, November 1—5. 5 Hereafter, references to the Textual Notes will be indicated by the abbreviation "TN." Not all the readings of the fourth edition can be trusted, of course. An example is TN 75, in which the original phrasing more accurately echoes the translation of Voltaire's Letters Concerning the English Nation (1733) that Fielding apparently used. The translation reads: "But then it must be also confess'd, that the Stilts of the figurative Style on which the English Tongue is lifted up, raises the Genius at the same Time very far aloft, tho' with an irregular Pace" (Letter XVIII, p. 178). Usually, however, there is no such convenient method of testing the authenticity of a revision. And even here it is possible (though not very probable) that Fielding "corrupted" his own text, perhaps having forgotten his source, or believing that the shift of the negative (from the adjective within the phrase to the preposition governing the phrase itself) was better English, syntactically more direct and logical. 6 The True Patriot , 26 November 1745; see also the numbers for December 3, 10, 24. 7 One of these readings, and possibly the other, is clearly an improvement. One could, I suppose, defend "pecked" ( A ) or "picked" ( C ) as descriptions of Mrs. Tow-wouse's chin, but "peeked" (i.e., peaked) is both more likely and more usual. Consider, for example, the old usurer in Smollett's Roderick Random , Chapter XI, whose chin is "peaked and prominent." It would also seem more precise for Parson Adams, smarting from the rough jests of the company at the "roasting" squire's, to say that his Order was not a suitable "Subject" of scorn; his own experience, as well as that of many other clergymen in those rude days, is enough to show that the priesthood was the "Object" of contempt (see below, pp. 93-94.) 8 Besides Digeon (pp. 59-69), two other scholars have briefly treated Fielding's revisions of Joseph Andrews : Erich Bosdorf, Entstehungsgeschichte von Fieldings "Joseph Andrews" (Weimar, 1908), pp. 18-25; and Wilbur L. Cross, The History of Henry Fielding (1918), I, 352-354. Although Digeon's remarks are occasionally illuminating, these discussions do little more than notice a few of the more extensive variants. 9 A convenient catalogue of many of these oversights may be found in F. Homes Dudden, Henry Fielding: His Life, Works, and Times (1952), I, 352-353, n. 8. 10 Sir Thomas Robinson (1700?-1777) was commissioner of the excise under Walpole and appointed Governor of Barbados in 1741. He was "remarkably tall and lean," as Horace Walpole remarked, and the epithet "Long Sir Thomas" was a familiar one. 11 See de Castro's edition of Joseph Andrews , p. 369; and Dudden, I, 377. 12 For an excellent analysis of Fielding's rhetorical techniques, see Henry Knight Miller, Essays on Fielding's "Miscellanies" : A Commentary on Volume One (1961), pp. 150-163; also pp. 378-386). 13 Fielding added this passage to the second edition (through the press by 31 May 1742) at what must have been near the same time that he was composing his own consolatory essay, Of the Remedy of Affliction for the Loss of Our Friends , prompted by the death of his daughter, Charlotte, early in March 1742. In his admirable discussion of this essay and its place within the tradition of the consolatio , Henry K. Miller briefly examines Adams' impromptu sermon to Joseph ( Essays on Fielding's "Miscellanies ," pp. 228-271; especially, pp. 244-253). 14 For a discussion of this theme, see Battestin, The Moral Basis of Fielding's Art: A Study of "Joseph Andrews " (1959), Chapter VII. 15 Digeon, pp. 68-69. 16 See my article, "Fielding's Changing Politics and Joseph Andrews," PQ , XXXIX (1960), 39-55. 1 Altogether, this change occurs five times in Chapter 14.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">When Newman and his friends first became seriously alarmed in 1833 over what they felt to be attacks upon the traditional position of the Church of England, they decided that they were in duty bound to alert their fellow clergy and the interested public. One immediate result of this decision was, of course, the inauguration of the Tracts for the Times . Presently, early in 1836, another less well-known decision was taken: to give expression to their views in an old Church of England monthly, the British Critic . 1 In 1826 this magazine, which had been founded in 1793, was incorporated into the Quarterly Theological Review , and continued from 1827 as The British Critic , Quarterly Theological Review and Ecclesiastical Record , until its abrupt cessation in 1843. In February, 1836, Newman wrote to Keble, "I have bargained to supply Boone [the editor] with four sheets quarterly for the 'British Critic.'" 2 James Shergold Boone soon found his new colleagues too Catholic for his taste, and Newman's friends likewise were distrustful. By April 2nd, S. F. Wood, a former pupil and close friend, was writing, "I still find a feeling of uneasiness at your joining, as people call it, with Boone. . . . I do not say this at all as if I had changed my own mind about its being the best thing that could have been done to use that Review as an instrument , but merely to point out the desirableness of placing your own articles in contrast with theirs as soon as possible, instead of any attempt at harmonizing." 3 By December, Wood was warning Newman that "Boone is immensely disgusted with your Wiseman article, and declares that, if another of the same kind is sent, he will throw up the editorship (they say you make Wiseman a peg to hang your attacks on Protestantism on)" ( Letters , II, 218). In such an event, Wood continued, Newman might well feel compelled to take it on himself. This is what eventually happened. After Boone resigned in November, 1837, S. R. Maitland took over, but apparently he edited only the issue of January, 1838, for "his official relation to the Archbishop made a difficulty, and he resigned." 4 The British Critic then "practically passed into Mr. Newman's hands . . . and in July 1838 he became formally the Editor." 5 Among the Newman papers at the Oratory at Birmingham is a small collection of manuscripts which deal first of all with this gradual transfer to Newman, then with his own editorship, and finally with that of his successor down to the termination of the British Critic with the October issue in 1843. 6 While these papers have been labeled by Newman "British Critic—Letters to T. Mozley, as Editor, 1841-1843," they actually include a number of items that have to do directly with Newman's own editorship. These begin with some pages evidently torn from a journal, the earliest date being January 30, 1838, and the latest, May 7th, of the same year. Here in the form of brief notes is the record of his plans for the review. Following the pages from the journal is a sheet headed "Writers" on which various categories are specified, together with the names of the men Newman hoped would contribute to them. The next sheet contains an enumeration of subjects, again specifying in many cases the desired contributors, and in some cases marked "done." A third is entitled "Contents of Numbers, July, 1838," and shows that Newman's plans were taking definite shape, for it identifies the subject and author of each of the nine articles which appeared in the July issue, as well as six articles destined for later numbers. Apparently a good many years afterward, probably in the fall of 1875, Newman drew up a table of contents, first identifying the contributions of his group under the editorship of Boone, and then giving almost complete lists of articles and their authors during the period of his own editorship. The table of contents appears in two forms, one of which seems to me to have been a tentative or working list, which has been subject to correction and verification in the preparation of the other. 7 It is in Newman's own hand. The other might be described as a "fair copy," made, perhaps, as Father Dessain suggests, by Father William Neville, but in any event submitted to Newman's scrutiny and annotated by him. At Pusey House in Oxford is another listing of contents and contributors, tucked into the final volume of their set of the British Critic . It is closely related to those at the Oratory and bears the same superscription as the fair copy at the Oratory. This list, which appears to be in Newman's hand, has been corrected or queried occasionally, probably by the same person responsible for a series of markings in the Pusey House set. 8 Where there does not seem to be any significant difference in the three lists, I shall merely cite the Newman lists. Otherwise I shall refer to these manuscripts as the autograph list, the fair copy, and the Pusey House list. The fair copy is headed quite formally "British Critic" and is introduced by the comment, "Boone being the editor, we supplied four sheets, 64 pages, gratis." It starts with the issue of January, 1836, in which it identifies only one article, a review of Blanco White by Hurrell Froude. Up to the time when he took over himself, Newman lists some 21 articles which he considered contributions from his group. Beginning with the issue of April, 1838, and continuing through that of April, 1841, he attempts to make a complete set of identifications. There remain, however, some blanks and some question marks, which is hardly surprising when one considers the lapse of time and the tremendous preoccupations both of the period itself and of the intervening years. And yet, where the lists have been checked against reprints, contemporary letters of his own or of his friends, and the memoirs of other members of the Oxford Group, their accuracy has, in general, been sustained. The years 1838-1841 were busy and momentous ones for Newman and his fellow Anglicans. In addition to their regular professional duties, they were translating for The Library of the Fathers and writing Tracts for the Times as well as reviews for the British Critic ; and there is a general air of excitement and optimism in Newman's letters. Years afterward, he spoke of June, 1838, as "the zenith of the Tract movement," but added that by August there was "the beginning of a change of fortune." 9 Criticism was gathering force both among the bishops and among the Evangelicals, and Newman was tempted in November to give up the Tracts and the British Critic , to which he was pledged "only to the end of this year" ( Letters , II, 269, 273). The storm then seemed to pass off. "In the spring of 1839," he wrote later in the Apologia , "my position in the Anglican Church was at its height"; and he turned again with renewed energy and confidence to the Fathers, the Tracts , and to the British Critic . But by September a heavy blow had fallen, "the first real hit from Romanism which has happened to me." 10 This hit, it will be remembered, was delivered by Nicholas Wiseman in the Dublin Review for August, 1839. It was he who planted a suspicion in Newman's mind that the Anglican Church might be in schism. "This was such a shock to me that I at once made arrangements for giving up the editorship of the British Critic ." 11 And yet again he hesitated, bestirring himself to a new burst of activity, fighting desperately to stave off his doubts, and writing for the number of January, 1840, his article on "The Catholicity of the English Church." "It is written," he told his sister, "in answer to the article of Dr. Wiseman" ( Letters , II, 298). He also began the examination of the Thirty-nine Articles which was to culminate on February 27, 1841, in Tract 90 . But the plan to resign the editorship took definite form by November, 1840, when he told Bowden: "As to the 'British Critic,' I give it up to T. Mozley in the summer. This I have always wished to do. I shall have had it three years. I shall write for it, I suppose, as much as heretofore, and I hope our friends will not desert him" ( Letters , II, 314-315). Thomas Mozley had been a pupil of Newman's at Oriel, and was never quite able to throw off a faint feeling of inferiority in relation to his famous teacher, even after they became brothers-in-law; and, indeed, Newman seems to have had a way of imposing upon him with a slightly paternal condescension, which Mozley must have occasionally found annoying. On the transfer of the direction of the British Critic into his own hands, he remarks that Newman "then proposed to me to take the editorship, which, I need scarcely say, would in such a case be better described by sub-editorship, though I am sure this was not Newman's intention." 12 Mozley, who had for some time been regretting that the magazine was too limited in scope, and who complained that "when Newman took it up there seemed still more sameness and tediousness," soon found that "editing a Review is a very different thing from criticising it" ( Reminiscences , II, 207, 218). Very early did his troubles begin— first with Oakeley and Ward. Since it appeared to him "quite impossible either that any great number of English Churchmen would ever go so far, or that the persons possessing authority in the Church would fail to protest, not to say more," he tried to bring their articles within safer lines. But Ward, and perhaps Oakeley too, ran off "instantly to Newman to complain of my gratuitous impertinence" ( Reminiscences , II, 225). Very early, too, did Newman begin to have qualms about having confided the British Critic to his brother-in-law. With the appearance of Mozley's first number, containing as it did not only a slashing attack on Bishop Jewel and the Reformers by Oakeley but also an article by the editor himself ridiculing Dr. Faussett, the Margaret Professor of Divinity, in very personal terms, Newman scented danger. He wrote twice to Keble in the month of July, urging him to take a general control over the magazine privately, and admitting that "we were all rather hasty with T. M. . . . The question is whether it is not more possible to put T. M. under control than to extinguish the Review itself ." 13 In the event it was not so much a question of keeping Mozley under control as of Mozley being unable to keep his two most prolific and insistent contributors under control, Frederick Oakeley and W. G. Ward. (It is significant that by far the larger part of the "Letters to T. Mozley" included in these manuscripts is from these two, proffering articles, opposing editorial suggestions, or accepting them reluctantly and appealing to Newman.) In the end it was they more than anyone else who did extinguish the Review, bringing down upon their heads the devastating pamphlet by William Palmer of Worcester, A Narrative of Events Connected with the Publication of the Tracts for the Times . Palmer, one of the original group who had come together in 1833 "for the purpose of resisting Latitudinarian attempts against the established doctrine and discipline, and of defending the principles of the Church," 14 was now in 1843 very desirous indeed of avoiding any accusation of Roman sympathies by proclaiming himself a staunch and scandalized Anglican. He opened his prefatory remarks thus: "It is the design of the following pages to clear those who uphold Church principles from the imputation of approving certain recent tendencies to Romanism" (p. 87). Where those tendencies were to be found was made so abundantly clear that in spite of its title Palmer's pamphlet could scarcely be viewed as other than an attack upon the British Critic . "Under no conceivable circumstances . . . can the tone adopted by the British Critic ," wrote Palmer, "since it passed from the editorship of Mr. Newman in 1841, be excused" (p. 179). Its writers avowedly set aside the interests of the Church of England, and the Review "has for two years been under the influence of those who are uncertain in their allegiance " to the Church (pp. 155-156). Indeed, Palmer goes so far as to hint that these writers "are secretly convinced of the duty of uniting themselves to Rome, and . . . are waiting the moment to declare themselves, while in the mean time they are labouring to insinuate their own persuasion amongst the duped and blinded members of the English Church" (p. 179). The attack on Oakeley and Ward was too clear to be ignored, and the latter immediately replied in his Ideal of a Christian Church . . . A Defence of Certain Articles in the 'British Critic' . . . In Reply to . . . Mr. Palmer's 'Narrative' (1844). Again, as in 1833, Palmer banded together in conference with friends. They waited, he recollected in 1883, upon Mr. F. Rivington, who agreed "to suspend the publication of a periodical which had given such general offence." So the Church was delivered from the quarterly attacks of a magazine which had become "virtually a Roman Catholic organ under Church of England colours. The relief . . . at the termination of this unceasing sore was indescribable" (pp. 242-243). Thus was the British Critic extinguished, partly because of the excesses and indiscretions of some of its contributors; even more fatal, however, to its continuance was the underlying fear of Rome that was gripping the minds of Englishmen in those momentous years. But before its abrupt termination, it had published, in the five years under the editorship of Newman and Mozley, a distinguished series of essays by a distinguished group of men.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 This article is based on research for the Wellesley Index to Victorian Periodicals, 1824-1900 , now in progress in the Wellesley College Library under the general editorship of Professor Walter E. Houghton. The object is to identify the authors of anonymous articles in the leading monthlies and quarterlies, and to provide bibliographies of the essays in these journals contributed by over 5,000 Victorian writers. The Index is intended at this stage as a cooperative work: the editors are glad to share their findings with interested scholars, and hope that information about specific articles and individual contributors will be shared with them. 2 Letters and Correspondence of John Henry Newman during His Life in the English Church , ed. Anne Mozley (2 vols., 1891), II, 164. By Newman's bargain the Tractarians were to supply approximately 64 pages an issue, or roughly three major articles; with, according to the copy of a MS. letter from Newman to Joshua Watson, September 1, 1837, at Pusey House, Oxford, "the consequent liberty of being exempt from the Editor's censorship." Permission to use the MSS. at Pusey House was very kindly accorded by the Rev. R. M. Catling and his successor, the Rev. A. M. Allchin. 3 Letters , II, 183. Anne Mozley points out in the Letters of the Rev. J. B. Mozley, D.D. (1885), p. 71, that "one incidental use of the review was to furnish . . . a sort of practice-ground for the younger members of the party." 4 Letters , II, 246, 251. In 1838 Archbishop Howley appointed Samuel R. Maitland librarian of Lambeth, and Maitland, according to J. B. Mozley ( Letters , p. 71), "was frightened by an article of Pusey's on the Church Commission [submitted for the April issue], which he thought went too far for him in his present situation of librarian to the Archbishop." 5 Letters , II, 251. A letter from J. B. Mozley on February 6, 1838 ( Letters , p. 71), indicates that Newman was in fact the directing spirit behind the April number. 6 These MSS. are identified by the Reverend C. Stephen Dessain of the Oratory as "Various Collections, No. 65" and he has most kindly granted permission to quote from them. The author wishes particularly to thank Father Dessain for his kindnesses in answering questions, examining difficult readings and elucidating references. Our attention was called to the collection by Professor A. Dwight Culler of Yale, who arranged for us to borrow the microfilm of them from the Yale University Library. Specific references are almost impossible to give, as there is no foliation of the various lists, letters and scraps. Another group of MSS. dealing with the British Critic is at Pusey House in Oxford. It deals primarily with the dissatisfaction of Newman and his friends with Boone and with the period of transition, 1837-1838, but includes some letters as late as January, 1840. Again there is no foliation to assist in reference. 7 An approximate date for the compiling of these tables of contents is provided on an odd sheet at the Oratory, which reads, "N. B. October, 1875. Authors of articles"; while there is a further note at the bottom of the first or covering sheet which indicates when Newman sorted out these papers and put them together: "Not chronologized and merely kept for the chance of their being wanted as reference. It is a toss up whether or not to burn them. J.H.N., May 1, 1878." 8 These may have been made by W. J. Copeland or by Canon H. P. Liddon, according to Father Catling. 9 Letter to J. W. Bowden, Letters , II, 254. In January, 1838, he had written to Edward Churton of "the present fair wind and smooth current." MS. letter Newman to Churton, postmarked JA 30, 1838, at Pusey House. 10 Apologia pro Vita Sua (1888), p. 93, and Letters , II, 286. 11 Letter to Mrs. H——, July, 1871, printed by Matthew Russell in "Dr. [C. W.] Russell of Maynooth," The Irish Monthly , XX (October, 1892), 534. 12 Reminiscences Chiefly of Oriel College and the Oxford Movement (2 vols., 2nd ed., 1882), I, 6-7. 13 Correspondence of John Henry Newman with John Keble and Others, 1839-1845 , ed. [Francis Joseph Bacchus] (1917), pp. 136-137. 14 A Narrative of Events Connected with the Publication of the Tracts for the Times. With an Introduction and Supplement Extending to the Present Time (first ed., 1843; 1883), p. 117. 15 Richard Hurrell Froude, Remains , Part II, ed. [J. H. Newman and John Keble] (2 vols., 1839). All authors except those identified in the footnotes may be found in the Dictionary of National Biography . 16 Samuel Francis Wood (1809-1843), younger brother of Sir Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax, B.A. Oxford (Oriel) 1827. A barrister attached to the Inner Temple and a close friend of Newman's, who had been his tutor. 17 The MS. correspondence between Newman and Boone, Churton, Fox, Le Bas, Moberly, Palmer, Rivington, Thornton, Wigram and R. Wilberforce is at Pusey House unless otherwise indicated. 18 J. W. Bowden, Thoughts on the Work of the Six Days of Creation , ed. J. H. Newman (1845). 19 John Henry Newman, Essays Critical and Historical (2 vols., 1901). 20 Memoir of J [ oshua ] Watson , ed. Edward Churton (2 vols., 1861). Joshua Watson was one of the owners of the British Critic . 21 Frederic Rogers, Lord Blachford, Letters , ed. G. E. Marindin (1896). While there is a ? after Acland's name in the autograph list, a note in the margin reads, "Yes, vid Wood's letter of March [?] 2, 1837." Although no name is entered in the Pusey House list, the number of pages is given, indicating that Newman felt that his group had been responsible for it. 22 In spite of the attribution to Edward Churton in the Newman lists and a similar marking in the Pusey House set a letter at Pusey House from Churton to Newman, 28 Nov., 1837, makes it seem all but impossible: "The writer of an article in the BC for July, p. 62-88, is not, I suppose, an Oxford man. It shews some research, but there are some odd mistakes in it." The impression that Churton was the author undoubtedly arose from the fact that there was prolonged discussion in the following year about an article on the Jesuits to be reserved for Churton. Cf. "Revival of Jesuitism" in the issue of January, 1839. 23 An attribution in the Pusey House set to W. J. Copeland seems to have been made in mistake for the next article, for which there is other evidence of Copeland's authorship. Certainly the two articles are different in tone. 24 Newman proposes to send "a paper on Lamennais's new work,—one from Wood on I forget what subject, . . . and one from Mr. Harrison in continuation." 25 Nathaniel Goldsmid (1807?-1860), member of a distinguished Jewish family. B.A. Oxford, 1828. Became a barrister attached to the Inner Temple, 1831. Friend of Frederic Rogers and S. F. Wood. 26 The correspondence between Newman and H. W. Wilberforce, unless otherwise indicated, is in the Newman Collection at the Georgetown University Library. Microfilm of it was made available through the kindness of the Rev. Eric McDermott. 27 I have not been able to identify De Sainteville. There is an article in the Dublin Review for June, 1848, attributed to him by the editor, where he refers to having written this one in the British Critic . 28 Although there is no attribution for this article in any of the lists, there is a possibility that it was written by H. E. Manning. In his journal (see above, p.) Newman wrote, "Asked Manning to become a regular contributor," and on February 1, Manning replied, "I will pledge myself gladly to an article quarterly, savage and tartarly" (MS. letter at Pusey House). Manning was much concerned with Middle Schools in these years, and wrote to Archdeacon Hare in October, 1840, "Something effectual must be either done or prepared in the matter of education. Nearly two years will . . . be gone by since the first move." Manning did send an article to Newman in March, 1838, which Newman sent off to the printer at once, but this was apparently the one on Henry Martyn which appeared in July. (E. S. Purcell, Life of Cardinal Manning [2 vols., New York, 1898], I, 178, 228.) 29 List of Works Written and Edited by . . . Cardinal Newman in the Library of Sir William H. Cope [1885]. 30 John Henry Newman, Historical Sketches (3 vols., 1873). 31 Among the Newman letters at Ushaw College is one to Newman from Rivington (June, 1873) in answer to a query from him about certain articles in the British Critic . Rivington says the firm no longer has any accounts of the review—they were lost in a fire—but gives a few extracts from contemporary letters from Newman. For the issue of July, 1838, Newman had identified Mr. Wilberforce as the author of "John Jay" and Mr. Copeland as that of "Bishop Ken." (See the next article.) I am indebted to the Reverend B. Paine for the opportunity to consult a microfilm of these letters. 32 In view of a separate, and probably contemporary, list at the Oratory attributing this article to Rogers, it is curious that the Newman lists show such uncertainty. In the autograph the article is attributed to Wood. In the fair copy the entry is "S. F. Wood [?Rogers?]." In the Pusey House list the article is ascribed to S. F. Wood ? but another hand has written "F. R." We know that Newman had asked Rogers to write this review, but Rogers was having trouble with his eyes and was not sure that he could do as Newman wished (Rogers, Letters , pp. 48-49). The article has very generally been attributed to Rogers, by S. Wilberforce ( The Life of Samuel Wilberforce [3 vols., 1880-1882], I, 131), by Trench himself ( Letters and Memorials , ed. Miss M. Trench [2 vols., 1888], I, 228) and by Arthur Hugh Clough ( Correspondence , ed. F. L. Mulhauser [2 vols., 1957], I, 85). It is also assigned to Rogers in the marked set at Pusey House. It seems probable that although Rogers was the author of the review he may have been aided in preparing it for the printer by Wood. 33 That Newman had been counting on an article by Sewall for the October number is indicated in a letter to Bowden of August 17, 1838 ( Letters , II, 261). 34 Charles Thornton (1810?-1839). B.A. Oxford (Christ's Church), 1823. 35 John Keble, Occasional Papers and Reviews , ed. E. B. Pusey (1877). 36 On February 1, 1839, in a letter to H. W. Wilberforce, Newman enumerated the articles and their authors for the January number, thus confirming the attributions in the Newman lists. 37 In the autograph list there is a notation: "James Mozley in a letter of [illegible], 1839." In August, 1838, Newman had suggested to Mozley that he review this work. 38 Robert Francis Wilson (1809-1888). A pupil of Newman's at Oxford and at one time curate to Keble at Hursley. In his memorandum on subjects Newman noted, "Tract 80 with illustrations Wilson done," and again in the "Contents of Numbers, July, 1838" he wrote "Wilson Tract 80." 39 Samuel Fox (1801-1807). A.B. Oxford, 1825. A writer on antiquities. 40 In the Pusey House set this article is marked "H. W. Wilberforce." In the autograph list the name "Jebb" appears with a ?, but in the margin of the fair copy is a note: "March 1839 Wood spoke of an article of his own." There is no entry against this article in the Pusey House list, and it does not appear in the list of H. W. Wilberforce's articles appended thereto, nor in the letter from Newman to Rivington cited in note 42. 41 Isaac Williams, Autobiography , ed. G. Prevost (1892). In the autograph list the names of both Williams and R. I. Wilberforce appear against this article, but in the fair copy only that of Williams. In the Pusey House list Wilberforce has been crossed out and Williams substituted. 42 "W. J. Copeland" is the ascription in the autograph list. There is none in the fair copy, nor in the Pusey House list. However, conclusive evidence for Wilberforce's authorship is to be found in a transcription of part of a letter from Newman to Rivington of June, 1839, at Ushaw College, in which the author of article 8 is identified as the "Rev. H. W. Wilberforce." Because the information was sent in reply to a request for a list of Wilberforce's contributions, Rivington only transcribed the one item, thereby implying that it was his only contribution in that number. 43 In the autograph list the article is ascribed to Newman with a marginal note, "part R. F. Wilson." Again in the fair copy the entry is "Newman," but again with a note, "The part about Nicholas Ferrar is R. F. Wilson's ?" In Newman's "N.B. on Subjects" he had indicated Wilson as a possible reviewer of Turner's Nicholas Ferrar . On Sept. 8, 1839, Newman wrote to his sister Jemima (letter in the possession of Mr. J. H. Mozley) that in the October issue there was a short article on Nicholas Ferrar; he had written only the article on the American Church. On Oct. 25 he told her that she did not know the author of the article on Taylor versus Ferrar; it was a secret. The secret, I suspect, was that Newman had added the attack on Taylor and a defence of celibacy to Wilson's original article on Ferrar. 44 In the autograph list the attribution is to Newman, while in the fair copy it is "J. S. Brewer?" From the beginning Newman had wished to have Brewer as a contributor. Nothing seems to have come of his hopes, for I have found no contribution from Brewer during his editorship. Aside from the fact that Brewer was the editor of the book being reviewed in this article, which is not necessarily conclusive, there are remarks in the article which seem unlikely to have been made by him, such as, "We wonder Mr. Brewer should not have noticed it," and "Mr. Brewer adds nothing in elucidation of this point." 45 H. P. Liddon, Life of Edward Bouverie Pusey , ed. J. O. Johnston, R. J. Wilson (4 vols., 1893-1897). For some reason Newman did not include this appendix in his lists. 46 Charles Miller, Vicar of Harlow, A.B. Oxford (Magdalen), 1817. Prolific writer on church matters. Wrote on commutation of tithes in 1839, 1840, 1841, and 1842. Still in Crockford's Clerical Directory for 1876. 47 Although this article is assigned to T. Mozley in the fair copy, it is questioned in both the autograph and the Pusey House lists. Among the Oratory papers there is a single page of a letter of August 12, 1839, to Newman from a Mr. Price, who describes himself as "former editor of the Atlas newspaper." Newman apparently passed this letter on to Mozley when the latter became editor, with the following superscription: "This is the author of the article on French Churches. . . . He was to send me something more and never did." The only additional information I have been able to find is in a MS. letter to Newman from a Rev. Mr. Foulerton, dated January 3, 1840, at Pusey House, supplying the former with Mr. Price's most recent address (27 rue Royale, Calais) and adding that he was a member of the Church of England. 48 Memoirs of James Robert Hope-Scott , ed. R. Ornsby (2 vols., 1884). 49 In his memorandum at the Oratory "Authors of Articles," Newman confirms the attribution of this article as well as the ones on Rural Chapters in July and the Manufacturing Poor in October, "as by my sister H.E.M.'s letters to me." The same memorandum is included with the Pusey House list. 50 There is no attribution of this article in the Newman lists at the Oratory, but in addition to the letter to H. W. Wilberforce, there is a note on a very tattered sheet among the Oratory MSS., "On Justice Burton—Cotton." Judge Burton was the author of the book being reviewed. 51 S. R. Bosanquet, The Rights of the Poor and Christian Almsgiving Vindicated (1841). 52 Roundell Palmer, Earl of Selbourne, Memorials (2 pts., in 4 vols., 1896-1898). Charles Wordsworth in his Annals of My Early Life (1891), p. 187, confirms the attribution. 53 Oakeley lists his articles in the British Critic , but Father Allchin reports the letter to be hastily written, and the list is incomplete. 54 The attributions in this number are verified by a copy of a letter at the Oratory from Newman to Rivington, listing the authors and their articles, directing what payments are to be made, and giving the addresses to which they are to be sent. This letter is difficult to reconcile with one from Wood to Manning in January, 1841, quoted by Purcell ( Life of Manning , I, 249n), in which Wood says, "How grand our three articles, all of a row, in the British Critic , look." Purcell comments, "The three writers were Manning, Wood, and Rogers." 55 In the Pusey House list Bosanquet was first entered with a ?, but Oakeley's name was then substituted. 56 See note 54. It is true that Newman had written to Wood in September, 1840, "I want you to review Hope's speech in the House of Lords for the British Critic and give a sketch of the history of the struggle " ( Correspondence , p. 67), so that there is a bare possibility that this article represents a collaboration between Manning and Wood, but Manning alone appears to have been paid by Rivington. 57 There seems to have been some doubt in Newman's mind about Wilson's authorship. In the autograph the name is queried. In the fair copy it was at first left blank and then the entry "R. Wilson" is very faintly written in, perhaps tentatively. However, Newman wrote very favorably to Keble on March 25, 1841, of "Wilson's article" ( Letters , II, 338). Nevertheless one cannot entirely ignore two letters at Pusey House dealing with an article on the Church in the West Indies. On December 14, 1839, Henry Coleridge sent Newman "the MS. of a proposed article on West Indian Affairs" and on March 24, 1840, Rivington wrote to Newman that he had received the MS. "which accompanies the letter from the Archdeacon of Barbadoes [Parry] who would like it to appear in the April number." Both letters were, of course, a year earlier. It may also be noted that Newman was writing to H. W. Wilberforce on October 29, 1840, about an article on the Church Missionary Society to be ready by March. I have found no evidence that Wilberforce wrote such an article. 58 In separate notes in the Oratory and Pusey House MSS. Newman says of these two Cotton articles, "as by his letter to me." In the autograph the original ascription of "Chrysostom" was to Keble, but Cotton was written very faintly in the margin. It was attributed to J. Jebb in the Pusey House list, but the name was changed to Cotton in another hand. There is no attribution for the second in the autograph. 59 Although the authorship of T. Mozley is questioned in both the fair copy and the Pusey House list, Mozley claims the article with a fair show of confidence in the Reminiscences . 60 Mozley candidly tells us in his Reminiscences (II, 235) of his difficulties in recognizing even his own contributions after so many years, and says that "the precious memorandum book in which I carefully noted every change in the programme of the quarter . . . has long since gone from my gaze." For the attributions under his editorship I have had to depend heavily upon the Reminiscences but have tried to corroborate then whenever possible from other sources. The correspondence between Thomas Mozley and his contributors, unless otherwise indicated, is at the Oratory. 61 This attribution is included on a separate list with the Pusey House MSS. headed "H. W. W. Articles." 62 Because Ward made such a categorical and specific claim to the authorship of his articles in his Ideal of a Christian Church , firsthand and contemporary evidence, I have not here listed the individual letters from Ward to Mozley which are included with the British Critic MSS. at the Oratory. They do, however, throw light upon the relationships between Ward, Newman, and Mozley. 63 Mark Pattison, Memoirs , ed. [by his wife] (1885), and Essays , ed. H. Nettleship (1889). 64 J. B. Mozley, Essays, Historical and Theological (2 vols., 1892). 65 S. R. Bosanquet, Principia . A Series of Essays on the Principles of Evil . . . in Religion, Philosophy, and Politics (1843). 66 John Frederick Christie (1807-?). B.A. Oxford, 1828. Fellow of Oriel, 1829-1848. 67 Oakeley proposed an article to Mozley "in reply to Mr. Bird" and in explanation of passages in Bishop Jewel (see issue of July, 1841). Mozley persuaded him to reshape it and on May 27 Oakeley wrote, "Tomorrow I despatch the article on Mr. Bird and the greater part of that on Psalms and Hymns." In view of such evidence the marking in the Pusey House set attributing the article to J. B. Mozley would appear to be in error. 68 With the Pusey House list is a sheet headed "British Critic, January, 1843." It purports to identify the authors of articles in that number, but it omits both articles by Oakeley. I shall refer to this as the Pusey House listing. 69 R. W. Church, Essays and Reviews . (1854). 70 T. T. Carter in his Memoir of J [ ohn ] Armstrong, D.D. (1857) states categorically that the article is by Armstrong, with whom he had been closely associated and who had died only the previous year. The Pusey House listing attributes it to Markland—one of the authors being reviewed—and T. Mozley, but the evidence seems to me strongly in favor of Armstrong's authorship. 71 Wilfrid Ward, William George Ward and the Oxford Movement (1889). Oakeley in his letters to Mozley is most anxious that his anonymity be preserved with regard to this article. 72 George David Boyle, Recollections (1895). 73 Mozley ( Reminiscences , II, 219) says only, "A gentleman, I believe of Jewish extraction . . . wrote an article full of Hebrew scholarship." This might possibly have been Goldsmid, who, it will be remembered, was a friend of Rogers and Wood and who may have contributed to the magazine earlier. 74 "I should now be glad to be quite certain that I wrote the . . . review . . . of 'Nature a Parable,'" says Mozley in 1882. 75 Formby's letter to Mozley at the Oratory reads, "I believe I shall not be mistaken in considering myself indebted to you for the very kind notice which the British Critic has taken of the 'Visit to the East.'" Mozley only commits himself so far as to say, "It must have been I, too, who wrote the review of Formby's 'Visit to the East.'"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Grant Richards to James Joyce by Robert Scholes</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A good deal is known, now, about James Joyce's difficulties in getting Dubliners published. (A capsule summary of the pre-publication printing history of the book appeared in "Some Observations on the Text of Dubliners : 'The Dead'" in Studies in Bibliography , XV, 191 ff.) The publication of these letters from Richards to Joyce is intended to be not so much another re-hashing of those difficulties as a shift in focus from Joyce, the "hero," to Richards, the "villain." Thomas Franklin Grant Richards was one of those small publishers who were so influential in British literary developments around the turn of the century. Along with Richards, one thinks of Elkin Mathews, John Lane, Maunsel &amp; Co. (in Ireland), and Martin Secker (who became Richards's partner and through whose permission these letters are here published) as men who had a direct hand in the shaping of a new literature. Richards himself was the first publisher of G. K. Chesterton, Alfred Noyes, and John Masefield. He also published G. B. Shaw, Frank Morris, Richard Le Galliene, Ronald Firbank, the Sitwells, and Arnold Bennett. A. E. Housman's A Shropshire Lad and Last Poems came out under his imprint. And his life as a publisher was complicated by two of the most "difficult" writers of the early twentieth century — Baron Corvo and James Joyce. Richards has recounted much of his publishing experience in his book Author Hunting (1934, reprinted in 1960 by Martin Secker's Unicorn Press — and on the remainder lists last year). But his two most difficult authors — Joyce and Corvo — are not mentioned in that book. The reasons for Richards's reticence are interesting. He may, as Martin Secker suggests in a prefatory note, have been planning another book on them; or he may simply have been unhappy with his recollections of the Joyce and Corvo episodes. Certainly his letters to Joyce must have given him little reason for pride. In them are revealed the almost pathological carelessness and confusion of his publishing establishment — lost or missing manuscripts seem the rule, rather than the exception. And these letters must certainly have reminded Richards of an unhappy time in his own life. His first marriage and his first bankruptcy — both, apparently, melancholy affairs — lent a rather gray tint to this stage of his career. Much of his caution in dealing with Dubliners , as a matter of fact, stemmed from his precarious financial situation at the time. With some knowledge of his situation in mind, we may find Richards less of a "villain" than he is usually thought to be by those who know only Joyce's side of the story. He was, himself, only nine years older than Joyce and had not quite turned thirty-two when Joyce approached him with Dubliners in 1904, though he had then been an independent publisher for eight years. Curiously enough, Richards had once been himself a victim of literary censorship. In 1895 William Haddon, publisher of The Annual , wrote his printer about a story of Richards, saying, "There is a lot of 'Devil' and 'God' and the rest of it. I want it knocked out of it" (recounted in Richards's Memories of a Misspent Youth , 1933, p. 319). When it came to knowledge of the priggishness of the London literary world at that time, Richards had intimate and personal knowledge. In addition to his own experience in 1895, he had carefully followed the uproar over George Moore's Esther Waters (see Chapter VI of Author Hunting ). His advice to Joyce in 1904 was not unsound in terms of the temper of the times. That Richards could publish in 1914 what he would not publish in 1904 is more an indication of a change in the literary climate than of any change of heart in Richards. Only Richards's side of the correspondence is published here. A minimal running commentary has been supplied, including some information on Joyce's replies, but the material provided here is no substitute for the documents themselves and is not intended to be. Joyce's part of the correspondence is, unfortunately, scattered. Part has been published in Herbert Gorman's James Joyce , 1939 (hereafter referred to as Gorman), and another part in Stuart Gilbert's Letters of James Joyce , 1957 (hereafter referred to as Gilbert). Some fragments are quoted in Richard Ellmann's James Joyce , 1959. Some letters are still unpublished. Presumably all those letters not in Gilbert will be included in Ellmann's forthcoming additional volume of Joyce's letters. All the letters published here are quoted in full, only the addresses being omitted and the salutation and close somewhat compressed. The subscription has been run-in on the same line with the end of the text and the signature omitted. Richards's address for letters 1 and 2 was 48 Leicester Square, London, W. C. For letters 3 through 38 it was 7 Carlton Street, Regent Street, London, S. W. For letters 39 to 47, 8 St. Martin's Street, Leicester Square, London, W. C.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. September 29th, 1904 Dear Sir, I shall hope to write to you about your poems in the course of the next few days. Faithfully yours, Joyce wrote in October 1904, and again on 16 January 1905, asking Richards whether he intended to publish the manuscript of Chamber Music which Arthur Symons had given him that September.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. January 31st, 1905 Dear Sir, I must apologise for not having sooner answered your letter with reference to the manuscript of your verses. I regret to say that it is not at present possible for me to make any arrangements for the publication of the book; but I may say that I admire the work exceedingly and if you would leave the matter open for a few weeks it is possible that I might then be able to make you some offer. The manuscript, I regret to say, has by some mistake been packed up with some furniture of mine that has been warehoused and it is not easy at the moment for me to get at it, so that in any case I shall be glad if you can leave the whole question over for a short time. Faithfully yours, On 2 May Joyce wrote Richards that he had read in the Standard that Richards was in money difficulties. Joyce politely asked Richards to return the MS of Chamber of Music .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3. July 26th, 1905 My dear Sir, With reference to your collection of verses, "Chamber Music", which you kindly submitted to me through Mr. Arthur Symons, and which unfortunately got mislaid during my illness last year and changing houses, I write now to say that in spite of careful search I am unable still to lay my hand on the manuscript. Could you, do you think, reconstruct it from material in your possession? If you could do this and would care to submit it again to me for the firm with which I am now associated, I should hope to be able to make you on its behalf some offer for the publication of the work. I am exceedingly sorry for the inconvenience to which I fear this delay has subjected you. Believe me, my dear Sir, Very faithfully yours, This letter was originally sent to Arthur Symons as explained in letter 5 below, finally reaching Joyce with that letter in mid-August. "Changing houses" is a delicate reference to Richards's bankruptcy. For some years after this he operated his firm under his wife's initial, as "E. Grant Richards." On 17 August Joyce sent Richards the reconstructed MS of Chamber Music .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4. 1. 8. 1905 Mr. Grant Richards would be glad to know Mr. Joyce's present address as he is anxious to send him a letter; he thinks it likely that Mr. Joyce will have left Via S. Nicolo before this. [unsigned]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5. August 9th, 1905 Dear Sir, I now enclose the letter which I wrote to you some days ago and sent to Mr. Arthur Symons in the hope that he might know your address. Faithfully yours,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6. September 21st, 1905 My dear Sir, My great admiration for "Chamber Music" and Mr. Symons's advocacy of it make me want to arrange for its publication, but I cannot now, when the public seems to care increasingly little for verse by new writers, take on my shoulders the whole cost of its production. If you care to bear some part of that cost I shall certainly be pleased to publish the book and shall be proud to have it on my list. Believe me, my dear Sir, Faithfully yours, On 23 September Joyce replied that he could not help finance the publication of Chamber Music because he had no money. Once again he asked for the manuscript's return.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">7. Sept. 26th, 1905 Dear Mr. Joyce, I won't send you back your poems unless you tell me to again; and for this reason: if in this new business of Mrs Grant Richards's we make enough success with our first books, we shall be more able to make experiments with those which are not distinctly of a commercial nature. Of course if you would like to have the manuscript back so as to send it to another publisher, do not hesitate to say so. Believe me, dear Mr. Joyce, Very faithfully yours, On 28 Sept. Joyce replied gratefully that Richards could keep the MS until he could find a way to publish it. On 15 Oct. he wrote Richards that Symons had suggested he try Messrs. Constable with his poems and stories. He apologized for sending a new MS of the poems to Constable, and he offered Richards his collection of 12 short stories to be called Dubliners</field>
      <field name="fulltext">8. October 18th, 1905 Dear Mr. Joyce, Oc [ sic ] course I cannot for a moment complain of your having sent your manuscript to Messrs. Constable, and I hope for your sake that that firm will decide to publish the poems; you could not be in better hands. If they do not, then I shall still hope that we may be able to do something with them here. It will give me great pleasure to have the opportunity of reading "Dubliners". Sincerely yours, On 27 November Joyce announced that he had finished Dubliners and was sending it the next day. He told Richards that Constable had rejected Chamber Music .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">9. December 7th, 1905 Dear Sir, I have to acknowledge the safe receipt of your MS. "Dubliners". Faithfully yours, On 27 Jan. Joyce wrote asking for some word about his books, noting that he had added a story, "Two Gallants" to Dubliners . On 12 Feb. he wrote again for news, asking for a reply before 24 Feb. when he was scheduled to move.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">10. February 17th, 1906 Dear Mr. Joyce, I am sorry that you should have had to write again about your manuscript. I have read it myself on behalf of this house, and think very highly of it indeed; but I do not see that it has any of those selling qualities for which a publisher has naturally to look. Judged, indeed, from that standpoint, it has ["all" crossed out in ink here] the qualities which do not help a book: it is about Ireland, and it is always said that books about Ireland do not sell; and it is a collection of short stories. However, I admire it so much myself, and it has been so much admired by one or two other people who have read it, that we are willing to take the risk of its publication on the following terms:— We will pay you a royalty on the published price of copies sold of ten per cent, thirteen copies counting as twelve, paying, however, no royalty on the first five hundred copies. And we should ask you to undertake to give this house the refusal of all your future work over a period of five years from the date of publication of "Dubliners" on the following terms: a royalty of ten per cent on the published price of the first thousand copies sold; of fifteen per cent on the next 3,000; and of twenty per cent thereafter. This last clause will give us some encouragement to push your work even if in itself the sale is not satisfactory, for if, as I do not doubt, you do good work in the future, we should be sure of having the opportunity of its issue. If these terms are agreeable to you I will send you a detailed agreement for signature, and I would ask you to send us the one or two other stories that you mention. I may say that we should make the book a very attractive one. With regard to the verse manuscript, I would suggest your leaving this matter over until after the publication of the stories. However, that is, of course, a point for you to decide. We would not wish to stand in your way if you had the opportunity of issuing it satisfactorily through some other house. Believe me, dear Mr. Joyce, Sincerely yours, On 22 Feb. Joyce forwarded "Two Gallants" for inclusion between "After the Race" and "The Boarding House." A day or two earlier (in an undated letter) he had written accepting Richards's terms and inquiring about the date, format, and price of the book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">11. February 23rd, 1906 Dear Mr. Joyce, Very many thanks for your letter. I am glad that you have decided to accept the terms this house was able to offer you, and I hope that we may be able so to publish your books in the future as to encourage a relation entirely satisfactory both to you and to us. You speak about your financial position. Will you not tell me what you are doing and what your prospects are? I think we shall publish "Dubliners" at five shillings, in a rather slim crown octavo volume, carefully printed in heavyish type on a rather yellow paper. As for the binding, I purpose making it very plain indeed, but in this matter, and indeed in the whole matter of the book's appearance, we should like to know your wishes. Perhaps you can either send us a book or tell us of one which has pleased you, and that will give us some idea of what you would like. The book will come out in May or June or in September. I enclose a draft agreement. If you will sign it and return it I will send you a duplicate duly signed by Mrs. Grant Richards. Will you have the kindness to write a brief description of the book, of some 200 words in length, to be used as material for catalogues, advertisements, and so on? We could describe it here, of course, but we should not be likely to do so as justly as you would. It will, of course, be a description written as from the publisher and not from the author. Believe me, dear Mr. Joyce, Sincerely yours,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">12. February 27th, 1906 Many thanks for "Two Gallants" safely received. [unsigned] Joyce's answering letter of 28 Feb. is of considerable biographical importance. Readers should refer to Gorman, p. 147. Of bibliographical importance, however, is Joyce's insistence that his format and punctuation be followed exactly. He especially insisted that inverted commas to enclose dialogue were "a great eyesore"; Joyce returned the signed contract with this letter and suggested adding a fourteenth story to the book. He said he would prefer May or September to June for the publication date of the book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">13. March 6th, 1906 Dear Mr. Joyce, Many thanks for your letter of February 28th. You tell me that your prospects mainly consist in the chance of getting money enough from your book or books to enable you to resume your interrupted life. Here the commercial factor is of course the dominant one. One naturally dislikes to intrude that view too strongly, but it is not the best work which pays the best, as you know. Still, if you were to write a novel — a novel that might in some sense be autobiographical — and write it as well and as vitally as you have written these short stories, I believe that you might score a considerable success both of esteem and of sale. I enclose your copy of the agreement for "Dubliners" signed by Mrs. Grant Richards. In view of what you say I think you may take it for granted that we shall not publish the book until September. Believe me, dear Mr. Joyce, Sincerely yours, On 13 March Joyce announced that he would send another story to be inserted between "The Boarding-House" and "Counterparts." He added that he had written half of a novel in some sense autobiographical (25 chapters, 914 pages) but that in his present circumstances he could not continue it. Pages 477-902 of this early version have been found and published as Stephen Hero .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">14. April 12th, 1906 I should be glad if you could now let us have the remaining story for "Dubliners"; you told me you thought it would be ready in March, and we are now sending the book to the printer. [unsigned] On 15 and 22 April Joyce notified Richards of his progress on the "last" story. He intended to begin preparing a fair copy on the 23rd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">15. April 23rd, 1906, Dear Mr. Joyce, I am sorry, but I am afraid we cannot publish "The Two Gallants" as it stands; indeed, the printers, to whom it was sent before I read it myself, say that they won't print it. You see that there are still limitations imposed on the English publisher! I am therefore sending it back to you to ask you either to suppress it, or, better, to modify it in such a way as to enable it to pass. Perhaps you can see your way to do this at once. The same thing has to be done with two passages marked in blue pencil on page 15 of "Counterparts". Also — you will think I am very troublesome, but I don't want the critics to come down on your book like a cart load of bricks — I want you to give me a word that we ["I" crossed out in ink] can use instead of 'bloody' in the story "Grace". Sincerely yours, Joyce replied on 26 April that he could change nothing and would hold the manuscripts of the two stories Richards had sent back with that of the 14th, "A Little Cloud," until he learned whether Richards wanted to go on with the stories as written or drop the idea of publishing them. The marked passages in "Counterparts" were 1. "a man with two establishments to keep up, of course he couldn't . . . ." 2. "Farrington said he wouldn't mind having the far one and began to smile at her . . . ." 3. "She continued to cast bold glances at him and changed the position of her legs often; and when she was going out she brushed against his chair and said 'Pardon!' in a cockney accent."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">16. May 1st, 1906 Dear Mr. Joyce, Either I must have expressed myself carelessly in my letter to you or you must have misunderstood what I said. I told you what the printer had said not because I cared about his opinion as his opinion, or cared a bit about his scruples, but because if a printer takes that view you can be quite sure that the booksellers will take it, that the libraries will take it, and that an inconvenienly large section of the general public will take it. You have told me frankly that you look to your future being helped by your literary work. The best way of retarding that result will most certainly be to persist in the publishing of stories which — I speak commercially, not artistically — will get you a name for doing work which most people will regret. You will understand that it is not my view which has to dictate our conduct in this matter. It is both the effect which your persistence would have on the commercial possibilities of the book, and the effect that the publication of that book as it now stands in manuscript would have on our business generally. It would be easier to explain to you why I think you are taking a wrong course when you refuse either to make any alterations or to suppress the stories if I could have the opportunity of talking the matter over with you. I hope, however, that this letter will show you that from the point of view of policy there are two sides to the matter, and that you will see your way to alter the position you have taken up. In any case, please put on one side the idea that you seem to have, that I am at all interested in our printer's conscience. Sincerely yours, For Joyce's elaborate and witty defense of the "objectionable" passages in his two stories and the word "bloody" see his letter of 5 May (Gorman, p. 159). This letter also contains Joyce's own explanation of his purpose in writing the stories, his method of arrangement, and his estimate of their special quality.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">17. May 10, 1906 Dear Mr. Joyce, Many thanks for your letter. If I had written your stories I should certainly wish to be able to afford your attitude; but as I stand on the publisher's side, I feel most distinctly that for more than one reason you cannot afford it. You have written a book which, whether it sells or whether it does not, is a very remarkable and striking piece of work; certainly it is what you wanted it to be — a chapter of the moral history of your country. But a book is not written nowadays to any real effect until it is published. You won't get a publisher — a real publisher — to issue it as it stands. I won't say that you won't get somebody to bring it out, but it would be brought out obscurely and in such a way would be certain to do no good to your pocket and would hardly be likely to get into the hands of any but a few people. After all, remember, it is only words and sentences that have to be altered; and it seems to me that the man who cannot convey his meaning by more than one set of words and sentences has not yet realized the possibilities of the English language. That is not your case. The man who read your stories for us was a man whose work you are likely to know, Filson Young. He was as struck with them as I was myself. I told him a few days ago of our fears and showed him the passages, and I have also shown him your letters on the matter, and although the opinion of other people may not influence you at all, yet I can tell you that he thoroughly agrees with me about the impossibility of publishing the work as it is. But he is very anxious, as I am, that the book should not pass from our list. I hope, therefore, that you will think the whole matter over again. Believe me, dear Mr. Joyce, Sincerely yours, Filson Young, a literary journalist and critic, was a close associate of Grant Richards for a number of years. Joyce's long reply in defense of Dubliners (13 May 1906) was first published in Gorman, pp. 151-154.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">18. May 16th, 1906 Dear Mr. Joyce, I will try to be more categorical. First, though, let me see if I cannot remove a misconception that exists in your mind as to our attitude. My admiration for your book is a thing entirely apart, and necessarily so, from my conviction as to what is wise or not wise for us to publish. Personally I prefer the word 'bloody' in the places in which it occurs to any word you could substitute for it since it is, as you say, the right word; on the other hand a publisher has to be influenced by other considerations. Personally I have no objection to the other stories we have discussed, although I may say that in their present form they would damage their publisher. We are, for various reasons into which I need not go at this distance, peculiarly liable to attack. However, you concede the alteration of the troublesome word in "Grace"; well and good. You concede it in "The Two Gallants"; you concede it in "Ivy Day in the Committee Room"; leave it in "The Boarding House". In "Counterparts" I have no feeling about the allusion to 'two establishments [']; the other phrase must really come out. On consideration I should like to leave out altogether "The Encounter". "The Two Gallants" should certainly be omitted. Perhaps you can omit it with an easier mind since originally it did not form part of your book. The difficulties between us, therefore, narrow themselves down, since you have come some little way to meet me, and I hope now they will disappear entirely. Believe me, dear Mr. Joyce, Sincerely yours, Joyce's answer of 20 May is another long and important letter (Gilbert, p. 61). In it he argues reasonably but tenaciously for as few changes as possible. When no answer to these arguments had arrived by 3 June, Joyce wrote briefly requesting an answer for the sake of his "peace of mind."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">19. June 7th, 1906 Dear Mr. Joyce, An answer to your last letter to me has been delayed owing to my taking a brief Whitsuntide holiday. Heaven knows that we want to do everything that you want us to do, but for various reasons, which it would take too long to write down, our hands are to some extent tied. If this business were mine it would be a different thing. But I did notice very clearly "An Encounter" when I first read the manuscript, and we were at that time told by our adviser that we ought to get you to omit it. I was in doubts about it, but came to the conclusion that it was unnecessary to do so. But matter which to a large section of the public will seem questionable is cumulative in its effect, and when I came to read "The Two Gallants" I saw that to publish the book with that story as you had written it would be to draw attention to other things in the book which would otherwise pass. Perhaps you can re-write "The Two Gallants" — although I don't suppose you will. Still, in producing one's first book it is just as well to be guided by somebody's advice, and I don't honestly think that you could have a more competent adviser on the matter than I am. We cannot publish the book as it stands; that I am afraid is clear. We can only publish it with the alterations or omissions that so far I have suggested. If it were I who was publishing the book, admiring it as I do, I might be willing to bear any attack, organized or otherwise. But an attack on this house at the present moment, and on such a subject, would be extremely damaging. Your letters make me wish to meet you, and they make me wish to have your book as you have written it among my own that I value; but they cannot blind me to the impolicy of the attitude you are taking up. Believe me, dear Mr. Joyce, Sincerely yours, One of the most significant motives for Richards's timidity emerges in this letter. His bankruptcy and his new firm's struggle to establish itself in his wife's name make him extremely vulnerable to attack. In his answer of 10 June (Gorman, pp. 154-155), Joyce's patience began to show signs of wearing thin. He bemoaned the fact that this futile correspondence had delayed by two months the book's going to the printers. He announced his departure for Rome, where as a correspondent in a bank he would make d 150 a year—twice his Trieste earnings—and suggested, only half jocularly, that Richards might solve their problem by buying a critic or two.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">20. Dear Mr. Joyce, You are under a misapprehension: your book did go to the printers'; they set up a page, which happened to be a page of "The Two Gallants"; they kicked at its nature and it was that that made me read ["it" crossed out] the story, which I had not done previously, and that made me go into the whole question. I think that if you read the letters that have passed between us you will see exactly what we are willing to put our name to and what we dare not put our name to. It remains, therefore, for you to decide. Turn specially to the letter of May 16th, which was written in answer to certain concessions on your part. Presumably you are still willing to make those concessions, as detailed in paragraph 1. In "Counterparts" there is a phrase that must come out if we are to publish the book. We should like to omit entirely "An Encounter", but if you will give way on the other points we will give way on this. "The Two Gallants" must be omitted unless you can re-write it in the sense suggested in my letter of June 7th. Unfortunately as things stand at present you cannot buy one critic of importance, to say nothing of two; sometimes I wish one could! Also, the habit of multiple reviewing has gone out. I am very happy to hear of your engagement in Rome. In Rome at least you seem to be nearer to London, and more likely to come over; anyhow, I am more likely to be in Rome than I am to go to Trieste. And whatever happens to this book, which is giving you and me the writing of so many letters, I hope you will give us the opportunity of reading the novel. Believe me, dear Mr. Joyce, Sincerely yours, On 16 June Joyce wrote again (Gorman, pp. 155-157), his tone a bit sharper. Most of his remarks are repeated or clearly implied in Richards's answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">21. June 19th, 1906 Dear Mr. Joyce, Your manuscript is presumably the only one with which you are dealing at the present moment; it is one of several dozen with which we are dealing and about which we are corresponding, and although when I started writing to you I remembered perfectly well the different points, some of them now are less clear in my memory. However, I have looked again at that part of the manuscript that we have here and at your letters, and it seems to me that the best course will be for you to make the alterations to the extent that you are willing to make them and in the sense suggested by me, and return the manuscript to me, when, if I understand your concessions aright, the book will no doubt be able to go to the printer. With this object I am sending back to you to-day by registered post the balance of the manuscript. In "Counterparts" you say you are disposed to modify the passage to which I specially drew attention, but you will not omit it. Of course I do not know how far your modification will go; in any case, I should not care to take the responsibility of cancelling any passage with my own pen. As to "The Two Gallants", you say that I knew it to be in preparation. But I had no idea of its character. Return it, however, with the omission that you volunteer to make and I will see whether, in the hoped for event of the book going to the printer, it can be included, as I should certainly prefer, knowing your views. In brief: when I get your stories back I will re-read the whole manuscript and will judge it then afresh. Perhaps, too, with your modifications and read in their proper context, the passages may seem to me less likely to attract undesirable attention. You speak of the spectre of the printer, which you thought you had laid, rising again in my letter of the 14th. This is unjust. I referred to the printer in answer to a passage in your letter of June 10th, in which you spoke of the transit of the manuscript to his care having been delayed by copious and futile correspondence, in order to show you that the manuscript had been to the printer. You speak of his combining the duties of an author with his own honorable calling, and ask how he comes to be the representative of the public mind, and how he happened to alight magically on the particular passages that he did; and proceed to say that the printer is simply a workman hired by the day or by the job for a certain sum. That he should have alighted on that particular passage is a pure coincidence; your other points in this connection will be answered possibly by suggesting that you look inside any book, where you will find a printer's imprint. This im [ sic ] necessary. If a book is attacked as indecent the printer suffers also from the attack; and if it is sufficiently indecent he also is prosecuted. There is, I believe, one further story which you design for inclusion in "Dubliners", but which, when this trouble arose, you kept back. Please send that also with the others. I hope there may be no question about that! Believe me, dear Mr. Joyce, Sincerely yours, [initialled "EPH."—by Miss Hemmerde, Richards's secretary.] In his reply of 23 June Joyce said he would read the whold MS over, deleting the word "bloody" except in "The Boarding-House" and would return the revised MS with "A Little Cloud" included. He scoffed at the idea that the publisher of Dubliners might be prosecuted for indecency. (See Gilbert, p. 63.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">22. June 26th, 1906 Dear Mr. Joyce, The older I get the more convinced I am that no two people can ever understand one another on any subject — understand one another thoroughly, that is. I never suggested that the publisher of "Dubliners" could be prosecuted for indecency; what I did say was said in answer to your suggestion that a printer was a mere journeyman who had nothing whatever to do with the contents of a book: to that I pointed out that in the event of a book being indecent he was equally liable with the publisher, and if it were sufficiently indecent, would be prosecuted at the same time as the publisher. As for the printer, you seem equally to be unable to see my point. I quoted him to begin with not in deference to his opinion but as an evidence of opinion. He was the one person outside this office into whose hands the manuscript had passed, and immediately he protested. I ["fore" added in ink here]saw from his protest a series of such protests. If as I hope we can send the manuscript to the printer on getting it back from you, we must not write each other any more letters! Believe me, dear Mr. Joyce, Sincerely yours, On 9 July Joyce returned the revised MS with a list of the changes he had made (Gorman, p. 157). He added that he felt the stories had been injured by the deletions. On 24 Aug. and again on 9 Sept. Joyce wrote to ask Richards's decision.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">23. September 14th, 1906 I am sorry for the delay in writing to you definitely about "Dubliners"; I hope to do so within a very few days. [initialled as in No. 21 above by EPH.] On 23 Sept. Joyce asked again for a decision.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">24. September 24th, 1906 Dear Mr. Joyce, Some time ago you told me, in answer to an enquiry of mine, enough of your circumstances to make it perfectly clear to me, even if you had not gone on to say so, that the success of your literary work was a matter of very great importance to you — "My prospects are the chance of getting money enough from my book or books to enable me to resume my interrupted life". That fact has been in my mind in the re-reading — the very careful re-reading — of "Dubliners", and while I cannot say it has been the dominant factor, it has been a factor in making me decide that we cannot publish the book. You have certainly gone a good way to meet our objections to it — objections based on other people's prejudices and not on our own, as I have tried to make clear to you — but it still remains of a kind that would not, I think, be successful, that would prejudice the majority of its readers against its publisher, and would stand in the way of your gaining success with any future work. If you had put the same matter, if you had treated life equally frankly, in a long novel, our objections would not be so potent. A long novel might succeed where a collection of short stories of equal merit would not. You are working, you told me, at a long novel. Whether you will be prepared, after the trouble there has been over this book, to offer it to us, I don't know. I think you will be wise if you decide to do so, since we at least know what you are capable of; and moreover we would give you a decision within a fortnight of the arrival of the manuscript. The artist is allowed greater latitude in a novel, why it is difficult to say; and assuming that the novel is a success, it could be followed by "Dubliners", perhaps under those circumstances without any alterations other than those you have already made. In other words: a man who has made a success is permitted greater liberty by the critics and by the public. I would urge you, therefore, to put "Dubliners" on one side; to complete your novel; and to allow the appearance of "Dubliners" to rest largely on the success of the first book. It is possible, of course, that you might find some other publisher less timid than this house: for instance, Mr. John Long might publish "Dubliners". Still, even so I think you would be wiser to hold it back. It is idle at this time of day and in view of what I have said for me to reiterate my own admiration for your book, but I can assure you that that admiration is both great and sincere; and I am convinced that if, for the present at least, you will be guided by certain practical considerations, your work should meet with considerable success. And whether you see fit to offer us your novel or not, you can depend on my doing everything in my power to be of assistance to that end. Believe me, dear Mr. Joyce, Very faithfully yours, P.S. I am keeping the manuscript here until I hear from you. Joyce's reply seems to have been lost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">25. October 18th, 1906 Dear Mr. Joyce, I do not think I can usefully add anything to my last letter with reference to "Dubliners". You know how much we regret finding it impossible to publish the book. To bring it out as it stands, or even with the emendations you suggest, would be quite valueless from your point of view: it would bring you neither money nor reputation. If, however, you can bring yourself to complete your novel and it has the strength of your short stories, I think it might bring you both money and reputation, and that then, as I have said, "Dubliners" could follow it. The manuscript of your poems is going back to you under separate cover. Believe me, dear Mr. Joyce, Sincerely yours, On 22 Oct. (in a letter not yet published) Joyce wrote, making further concessions. Among them he agreed to suppression of "A Little Cloud" and "Two Gallants", saying of the latter that he felt it was second only to "Ivy Day in the Committee Room" among the first thirteen stories.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">26. October 26th, 1906 Dear Mr. Joyce, I am afraid we must, however regretfully, stand by what we said in our last letter. If I knew you better I would implore you to put away these stories until the novel is finished, published and a success. That you should be discouraged is perhaps natural; but discouragement is a luxury which I find it less and less possible to indulge in. I am afraid you think we have treated you badly, but if this is so I am sure you are mistaken; and although what we have done has been in our own interest it is also, although you may not see it now, in yours too. As far as the novel is concerned, we will accept or refuse it within fourteen days of our seeing it — if, that is to say, you are willing to let us see it at all. Of course it would be subject to an entirely new agreement. I am returning the manuscript under separate cover. Believe me, dear Mr. Joyce, Sincerely yours, If Joyce answered this letter, his reply is lost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">27. November 27th, 1907 Dear Sir, We have now found the manuscript of your "Chamber Music" which you will remember was mislaid some time ago, and are sending it to you herewith, as you will no doubt like to have it. Faithfully yours, [Typed signature initialled "EPH"] Joyce acknowledged receipt of the MS on 2 December 1907. His next contact with Richards came when he stopped in London on his way to Ireland in 1909, but found the publisher not in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">28. August 25th, 1909 Dear Mr. Joyce, I was sorry to miss you when you called. I understand that you are passing through London again in a few days and I shall then hope to be more fortunate. Sincerely yours, On 4 Sept. 1909 Joyce replied that he would not have time to stop on his way back from Ireland, adding that Messrs. Maunsel of Dublin had accepted Dubliners and were planning to bring it out the following spring. But two years later Dubliners had still not appeared, and Joyce was embroiled in a dispute with Maunsel &amp; Co. much like his dispute with Richards. In August of 1911 Joyce prepared a circular letter called "A Curious History" (reprinted in Gorman, pp. 206-208) in which he recounted his troubles with Dubliners and its reluctant publishers—both Irish and English. He sent Richards a copy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">29. August 28th, 1911 Dear Mr. Joyce, I am, naturally, interested in the letter which you are sending to the press and of which you have been kind enough to send me a copy. I don't think you quite realize a publisher's difficulties. But still . . . . . . . . I have often thought of your work and if at any time you care, in spite of what has passed, to let me see anything else on which you may have been engaged, I hope you will not hesitate. Sincerely yours, Joyce continued pressing Maunsel to publish until September, 1912, when Manusel's printer, Falconer, destroyed the one thousand copies which he had run off, and Joyce acknowledged defeat. After trying many other publishers, Joyce returned to Richards in desperation on 23 November 1913. Between the break with Richards in December 1907 and November 1913 when Joyce offered him Dubliners for the second time, the book had been rejected by at least ten publishers. In addition to Maunsel, Joyce had failed with John Long (twice—once in Feb. 1907 and again in April 1913), Hutchinson &amp; Co. (refused to see it in Feb. 1908), Alston Rivers (would not see it in Feb. 1908), A. P. Watt (a literary agent recommended to Joyce by Arthur Symons who refused to undertake Dubliners in April 1908), Sisleys Limited (would publish it if Joyce helped finance — April 1908), Greening &amp; Co. (rejected it in April 1908), Archibald Constable (April 1908), Edward Arnold (July 1908), Martin Secker (Dec. 1912), and Elkin Mathews (the publisher of Chamber Music , rejected Dubliners in March 1913). Other publishers, whose rejections have not survived, no doubt swelled the chorus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">30. November 25th, 1913 Dear Sir, Your letter of the 23rd instant arrives during Mr. Grant Richards's absence in the United States. It is so long since your work was in our hands that we could not say anything definite about it until we had the opportunity of re-considering it. If you will send us a set of proofs together with your preface we will go into the matter without delay and will write to you shortly after Mr. Grant Richards's return in about a fortnight. Faithfully yours, [signed by E. P. Hemmerde] By January 1914 Joyce had sent Richards the set of proofs salvaged from Dublin plus a preface. The preface, "A curious History" in a new guise, appeared in the Egoist on 15 Jan. On 8 Jan. Joyce pressed Richards to decide about publishing the book and answer by return mail. On 19 Jan. he made the same request.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">31. January 20th, 1914 Dear Mr. Joyce, I do not gather from your preface to "Dubliners" or from any of your letters whether the book as it now stands in type has been altered to meet any of the objections of its critics, or whether it is now in is original form as it was first offered to me or in some other form of which you approve. And will you let me hear from you also on the following points:— 1. Do you insist on the printing of the Preface? 2. Are you still willing, under protest, to allow any very slight alterations in the text? (I am not at all sure that I am going to suggest any). 3. Is there any possibility of any person, or restaurant, or public-house, or anything of the kind, feeling, if the book is published, that there is ground for a suit against the publisher for libel? 4. Would you have any objection to an introduction being written to the book by some well known literary man? Sincerely yours, Joyce replied immediately, expressing willingness to have his preface replaced by an introduction, rejecting the possibility of the book resulting in any legal action, and suggesting that, under the circumstances, alterations in the text had better be waived. He offered to take 120 copies of the book at trade price for sale in Trieste.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">31. January 29th, 1914 Dear Mr. Joyce, I have before me the agreement that you entered into with this house for "Dubliners". We will give you now exactly the same agreement, on the understanding that you take, as you say, 120 copies of the book at trade price. The book would be published at 3/6 net and we should supply the copies to you at 2/6; and it is understood that you will pay for them as soon as they are ready. The book shall be put in hand at once and published as soon as can be conveniently arranged. Sincerely yours, On 3 February Joyce replied suggesting an increase in royalties from 10% to 15% after the first 8,000 copies and offering to read and return proof in two days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">33. February 27th, 1914 Dear Mr. Joyce, Here is an agreement which embodies the terms in the old contract modified in accordance with the one or two points raised in your letter to me of February 3rd. We will try to bring the book out in May. By the way, the Irish compositors have not treated your dialogue in the conventional way: they have not put the various speeches between inverted commas but have adopted what to my mind is a very ugly, awkward arrangement of their own, which will act as a bar to the ordinary reader. I take it for granted that the usual method can be followed. We will decide about the preface a little later. It is possible that the more important of the facts it contains could be incorporated in the introduction by another hand which I have in mind. It is Mr. Filson Young whom I asked if he would write an introduction as he had read the original manuscript and liked it. He replied that he would decide when he saw the whole book in our proof. If you will sign the agreement and return it to me I will send you a duplicate signed by this firm. Sincerely yours, P.S. There is still one point that troubles people here: the suggestion conveyed by what you say in your preface about the Dublin publishers asking you to change all the names of public houses, restaurants, etc. And they say, surely there must have been some reason for their burning of the edition. However, you have assured me that there is no need for us to fear any action for libel, and I am relying on your assurance. On 4 Mar. Joyce replied (in a letter reprinted by Stuart Gilbert—p. 25—in a very garbled fashion) with a strong defense of the punctuation, for which he was to blame rather than the Irish compositors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">34. March 9th, 1914 Dear Mr. Joyce, We will certainly try to bring your book out before the end of May; and you can have as many copies as you require over and above the 120 at the same price. I thought it possible that it might have been by your wish that the printer treated dialogue in the way he did, and I gave much consideration to the matter. I am sure it is a mistake to present a new book by a writer not well known in the way that in this respect you would prefer. Let us do nothing to hinder the possible reader. I am glad to have your fresh assurance in regard to possible libel actions. I confess that even when I grant your suggestion that the intention was to weary you out, I cannot divine the motive. Sincerely yours, This was mailed with a note from E. P. Hemmerde to the effect that G. R. had left town without signing the agreement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">35. March 23rd, 1914 Dear Mr. Joyce, A very shocking thing has happened. The printers have managed to lose — heaven only knows how:—it seems all of a piece with the irritations you have already suffered in connection with your book — pages 3 and 4 and 13 and 14 of "The Sisters". Can you supply us with another copy? I have never known a thing of this kind happen and I am very sorry it should have happened in your case. I enclose your copy of the agreement, which has been delayed owing to my absence from town. Sincerely yours, On 26 March Joyce sent typed copies of the missing pages and asked for the return of the printed title pages from the Dublin proofs. On 8 May Joyce wrote that he had corrected proof some days previous and was waiting for revised copy (which he never saw). He sent Richards some press notices of Chamber Music .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">36. May 13th, 1914 Dear Mr. Joyce, The sheets you send shall certainly be inserted in the review copies of "Dubliners". Sincerely yours, On 14 May Joyce wrote sending corrections for the revised proof (which were never made) and on 13 June he sent directions for the mailing of certain copies. On 15 June Dubliners was finally published.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">37. June 17th, 1914 Dear Sir, We have attended to the various directions as to despatch of copies of your book. We must remind you however that the agreement implies that all the copies to be taken by you should be paid for on publication and we shall be glad therefore if you will let us have a cheque in settlement. It is true that the agreement says "on receipt" but we are quite ready to send the books to Trieste and are only keeping them here for your convenience. Yours faithfully [initialled by "EPH"] This was followed by another note from E. P. H. on 25 June, thanking Joyce for a cheque.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">38. June 30th, 1914. Dear Mr. Joyce, I don't know whether you are seeing the reviews of your book. The critics, according to their kind, lay stress on what they consider its dismal atmosphere, but they have, almost without exception, spoken very well of the book, and one or two have spoken of it even as well as I think it deserves. Those of my friends, too, whose opinion I value and on whom I have urged the reading of the book, have written to me enthusiastically. I hope you are satisfied; and, incidentally, I hope you are satisfied with the appearance of the book. Now, what are you going to do next? Perhaps indeed in the long period that has passed between the writing of "Dubliners" and its publication you have produced other work. Sincerely yours, On 3 July Joyce suggested that Richards might be interested in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , which had been running serially in The Egoist . He still hoped that some mistakes in the text would be corrected in a future impression. (To date they have not been.) On 2 Feb. 1915 Joyce sent Richards a list of corrections for Dubliners , still distressed by the fact that he had not been able to read a set of revised proofs. He wrote again asking for copies of the press notices of Dubliners which he copied out himself in longhand and returned to Richards. Early in March, Ezra Pound delivered the manuscript of A Portrait (which had been running serially in The Egoist for a year) to Richards, whose contract with Joyce gave him the refusal of that manuscript. On 24 March Joyce wrote, asking a series of questions and enclosing a letter he had received from the noted literary agent J. B. Pinker. Pinker, who was agent for Joseph Conrad and H. G. Wells, had been introduced to Joyce's work by Wells. He had written Joyce on 10 Feb. suggesting that he might become Joyce's agent. On 5 April Joyce announced (Gilbert, p. 78) that he was making Pinker his agent. He was anxiously awaiting the reaction to his book in the Irish press.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">39. April 12th, 1915 Dear Mr. Joyce, I was very glad to get your letter of March 24th and to hear that you were well and, to use your own word, unmolested. Yes; I have now the complete copy of your novel and I hope to write to you about it quite shortly. By the way, as I am writing I had better clear up two or three misconceptions. If you will look up the agreement for "Dubliners" you will see that you ought not, as a matter of fact, to have let anyone publish your novel serially except by arrangement with me. However, we will let that pass. But the "Smart Set" certainly must not publish it except by arrangement with me — unless, of course, I refused it. Mr. Ezra Pound came in a week or two ago and saw my secretary who explained the matter to him, so perhaps you have already heard. I don't at all understand what the Editor of the "Smart Set" means when he tells you that if there had been more time before the publication of the American edition of "Dubliners" he would have printed more of the stories. No American edition of the book has been arranged for; and it is odd that he should have thought one was to appear since he first heard of the book from an American publisher, a friend of mine, whom I was trying to induce to publish it. I will write to my friend now in the hope that he may clear up the tangle and persuade the "Smart Set" to use more of the stories. Thank you for letting me see Mr. Pinker's letter about your work. No further notices have appeared, I think, since those we have already sent you. The enclosed letter ought to have been sent to you sooner. It came at a time when we did not know if it was safe to send things to you and it somehow was overlooked when the other letters were forwarded. I hope it is nothing important. Sincerely yours,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">40. April 14th, 1915 Dear Mr. Joyce, I wrote to you yesterday, but I may as well answer the letter I have received from you this morning. In writing of Mr. Pinker you refer to him as "Mr. Wells's secretary or agent". He is not Mr. Wells's secretary. He is an ordinary literary agent — a very good literary agent, in fact. He sometimes handles Mr. Wells' own work. I confess though that it comes as a surprise to me that he has set up as a dramatic agent. I should have thought that dramatic agency work was better handled by the exclusively dramatic agents, of whom there are one or two, Miss Elizabeth Marbury being the best known. Yes; I got back the press cuttings. Neither the "Freeman's Journal" nor "Sinn Fein" has reviewed your book. Sincerely yours, On 19 April Joyce wrote explaining patiently that A Portrait had begun appearing serially before his contract with Richards, who therefore had no legitimate complaint. He asked again about Irish reviews of Dubliners and about his list of corrections. He also asked for a financial statement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">41. April 26th, 1915 Dear Mr. Joyce, There has been no American edition of "Dubliners". Pirates in American are not now active. In any case a book like "Dubliners" is unlikely to have been pirated; and if it had been pirated I should have heard of it. The letter that was written to you speaking of an American edition was evidently written under a misapprehension. Such things do happen. Of course we have no right to object to your letting Mr. Pinker handle the dramatic rights of "Exiles". A letter of mine crossed yours in which I told you that the "Freeman's Journal" and "Sinn Fein" have not reviewed your book. Your corrections for "Dubliners" were duly received. A statement of sales to the end of the year shall be sent to you very soon. Sincerely yours,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">42. April 29th, 1915 Dear Mr. Joyce, I enclose herewith a statement of the sales of "Dubliners" to the end of the last half year. You will see that at that time thirty-nine more copies had to be sold before the royalty begins. No; Mr. Pinker was never Mr. Wells's secretary. Before he started as a literary agent, now many years ago, he was editor, or assistant editor, or something of the kind, of "Black and White" — in its early days, of course. I get a letter from him to-day asking if I am prepared to exercise my option on your novel. Surely, unless you have altered the arrangements you told me you were making, this is not a matter about which I am to deal with him ? I should like you to tell me definitely. In any case, I am not quite ready yet to speak about the novel but I hope to write to you very soon. Sincerely yours, [Statement of Joyce's Dubliners account with Grant Richards, dated December, 1914, and enclosed with letter no. 42 above.] June 15 Number of copies printed 1250 Dec 31 Copies free (for review, etc.) 117 " on hand 634 751 " Copies sold 499 499 461 No royalty is payable till after 500 copies are sold. The figures 499 461 refer to the royalty agreement between Joyce and Richards which provides that for royalty purposes thirteen copies count as twelve. Aside from the 120 copies taken by Joyce, only 379 copies of Dubliners had been sold. Stunned by the poor sales of his book Joyce called the state of affairs "disastrous" in a letter of 7 May. He insisted that Richards deal directly with Pinker in the future.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">43. May 13th, 1915 Dear Mr. Joyce, Even before the war the usual fate of a volume of fiction by a new writer was hardly better than that of "Dubliners". Many quite reasonable novels with more of the essential stuff of popularity in them have sold less well than 379 copies. And "Dubliners" is not a novel. Collections of short stories are always handicapped. And there was the war. The 120 copies that you bought are included in the number shown as sold. I will see if there is any amount owing by you and if there is I will enclose a note of it; but do not, if there is anything owing, send it, because on the next statement, which will include the matter of the "Smart Set" stories, there will be some small balance due to you which can be set off. Do not, in any case, I beg you, describe the position as "disastrous". It is not encouraging, but the position of very few books is encouraging just now. I note that you have appointed Mr. Pinker your literary agent; and I have already returned the end of the novel to "The Egoist". Sincerely yours,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">44. May 18th, 1915. Dear Mr. Joyce, You may think it an ironic commentary on my saying to you the other day that there was no need to be discouraged by the comparatively small sale of "Dubliners" that I write now to say that I do not want to publish "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man". If it were not for the war; if it were not for the general depression; I should, although I might have hesitated, have availed myself of my option. But to-day I am afraid of the book. It demands a public of intelligent readers. There are such readers but they are difficult to get at; and they are peculiarly difficult to get at now. Sincerely yours, For obvious reasons correspondence between Joyce and Richards became less frequent after May of 1915. Harriet Shaw Weaver and The Egoist magazine finally undertook to bring out A Portrait in book form. And ultimately Grant Richards published the play Exiles . Richards's side of the correspondence after 1917 has not yet been located. From Joyce's letters to Richards in the Slocum Collection at Yale, we learn that in the case of Exiles Joyce again was denied a second revision of proof. In a letter on this matter (28 July 1918) Joyce returned to the question of the text of Dubliners , observing that about two hundred mistakes which he had corrected on the page proofs had been allowed to stand in the first edition. Since Joyce had sent Richards his small list of additional corrections before seeing the published text, these two hundred lost corrections must be different from those on Joyce's list, the two hundred not being on the list because Joyce assumed they would be made from the page proofs. The grand total of errors found by Joyce and never yet corrected in any published text is thus well over two hundred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">45. May 7, 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce I am rather ashamed at having so long delayed in writing to thank you for your book. I have added it to "Dubliners" on my shelves with very great pleasure, a pleasure however that is qualified by the absence of my own name from the title-page. I am still however inclined to think that if a regular publisher had put out the book there would have been trouble. I hope it is being successful. When I saw H. G. Wells's review I wrote and asked him if he had read "Dubliners" and sent him a copy on hearing that he had not done so. In self defence I should perhaps add that your book arrived considerably later than your card which heralded its coming. Very Sincerely yours</field>
      <field name="fulltext">46. July 16th, 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce, I think we shall be able to publish your play in January. I should like to bring it out before that but I am afraid it will be impossible. Proofs shall be sent to you as soon as I can get them from the printer. But getting proofs from printers is a difficult job in these days. They are all working with depleted staffs. I am sorry to read what you say about your sight. When you next write please tell me more. I hope it is only a temporary trouble that will pass. Sincerely yours,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">47. July 30th, 1917 Dear Mr. Joyce, I have your letter of July 18th, but I do not quite understand it. You say: "My publisher will make a proposal to you about 'Exiles'". I think we shall print a first edition of five hundred copies, although this will depend on whether some American publisher — Mr. Huebsch or another — prefers to set the book up or to take part of my edition. I shall communicate with Mr. Huebsch as soon as I have proofs. As I think you know by now, I am not myself at present printing a second edition of "Dubliners" but am taking some copies from Mr. Huebsch to go on with. I should have printed a second edition now if conditions had been normal. Sincerely yours, In 1921 Exiles was published by The Egoist Press; and in 1923, when Jonathan Cape brought out his edition of Dubliners , the complex and difficult relationship between James Joyce and Grant Richards had finally come to an end. The editor of these letters wishes to express his gratitude to Mr. Martin Secker and the Cornell University Library for permission to publish; to the libraries of Yale and Harvard Universities for permission to consult related materials; and to the American Philosophical Society for a research grant which provided the time for the editorial task to be performed.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Government Printing in Massachusetts, 1751-1801 by Rollo G. Silver</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To one historian, printing is an art; to another it is a means of communication; to a third, printing is a commercial activity. These aspects—aesthetic, intellectual, economic —all deserve consideration although, for a particular moment in history, there may be emphasis on one or another. In a discussion of the printing of the American Revolution, for instance, the dissemination of political ideas becomes more important than the typography. But the financial operations of the printers of that period are also of interest. How much did printing cost? How was Massachusetts government printing obtained? How many copies of an item were printed? These and similar questions, when answered, bring the printer and his world into closer focus. Answers to some of these questions appear in government documents where, fortunately for the historian, formality requires greater detail than that found in the usual business papers of the time. Therefore, it is to such items that one turns to find out something about government printing in Massachusetts during the last half of the eighteenth century. Despite the vicissitudes of those years, quite a few documents have survived and while the story they tell is far from complete, they provide new insights into the relations between printers and the government. These documents comprise the bills from printers, petitions, contracts, and journals now in the Massachusetts Archives. 1 If the government had but one official printer at any time, the task of the investigator would be ten times easier and the resulting data ten times clearer. The Council and the House, however, each ordered its own printing and, from time to time, would appoint a joint committee to arrange for the printing of other publications. Thus, in 1751, the Journal of the Honourable House of Representatives was printed by Samuel Kneeland, "Printer to the Honourable House of Representatives," and proclamations were printed by John Draper, "Printer to His Honour the Lieutenant-Governour and Council." Another publication of that year, the Acts and Laws , bears the colophon: "Printed and Sold by S. Kneeland and T. Green, by Order of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governour, Council &amp; House of Representatives." Rather than attempt a straight chronological approach to the subject which would be as difficult to follow as a three-ring circus, it seems better to begin by discussing the relations of the House and Council with the more important printers. John Draper, probably a shrewd politician, managed to secure a good share of the government's business as printer to the Governor and Council. Isaiah Thomas notes that, once appointed, he "was honored with that mark of confidence and favor as long as he lived." 2 While Draper printed for the Council, Samuel Kneeland continued to print the Journal of the House even though competitors tried to underbid him. In accordance with its custom, the House voted every year on whether or not to print the Journal. After the vote to print, the House appointed a committee "to agree with a Printer on the most reasonable Terms for two Setts, one for each Member, and one for each Town in the Province," 3 or, in some years, "each Town and District in the Province" (JHR, May 30, 1755). Between 1751 and 1756, Kneeland obtained the work and charged 1/1/4 per sheet for paper and printing. 4 On May 28, 1756, the committee appointed to agree with a printer for that year reported that it had agreed with Green &amp; Russell who would print the Journal at 1/1/4 per sheet. The House, however, refused to accept the report and appointed another committee to arrange for the printing. On the following day, the new committee reported a bid of £1 per sheet, and, "after a Debate thereon," the House voted that "Mr. Samuel Kneeland be employed to print the Journal of the House, provided he will undertake to do the Business as cheap, and as expeditiously as any other Printer; and that the said Committee make further Enquiry, and report thereon." On June 4, the committee reported a bid of 19 s 4 d which Kneeland agreed to meet. The competitive pressure on Kneeland must have continued; during the following five years he printed the Journal for 19 s per sheet (JHR, May 28, 1757; June 2, 1758. Arc., CCLII, 53; LXXXIX, 344). When John Draper died on November 29, 1762, the Council's printing business became available again, but only momentarily. Within two days, Draper's son, Richard, printed and submitted a petition to the Council asking for continuation of the patronage. Richard Draper must have inherited his father's astuteness, for this is the only example of a printed petition found in the Massachusetts Archives (Plate I). The Council, of course, permitted him to have its printing business. Meanwhile the House had been changing the printers of its Journal. Kneeland lost the printing of the 1762 Journal to Edes &amp; Gill who in turn lost the printing of the 1763 Journal to Green &amp; Russell. At that time, some rather suspicious arrangements must have been made. Green &amp; Russell charged 24 s per sheet for paper and printing of the 1763 edition (Arc., CCLIII, 176). But on May 31, 1764, a committee reported that Green &amp; Russell agreed to print the Journal of that year for 12 s. The House, not unaware of this, voted on March 1, 1765, that a committee "inquire into the Sums granted for printing the Journals of the House the last Year, and make Report." Six days later, "The Committee appointed to inquire into the Conduct of the Committee and Printers of the Journals for the Year 1763, made report, which was Read and Accepted by the House." Precisely what happened cannot now be ascertained. However, Green &amp; Russell did find that 12 s a sheet was too low. In June, 1765, the House resolved that Green &amp; Russell would print the Journal for that year "at twelve Shillings per Sheet, for one Sett only, and that for each Town" (JHR, June 5, 1765). A little more than two weeks later, the House, finding that it could not not do without its own copies, resolved to let Green &amp; Russell "print and deliver to each of the Members of the House a Sett of Votes, provided they will undertake to do it at the Rate of six Shillings per Sheet" (JHR, June 21, 1765). Thus the price went up to 18 s and stayed there during the following year, too (Arc., CCLIV, 84). Then the House decided to make its agreements more specific: in 1767, it ordered that Green &amp; Russell print the Journals at " twenty-four Shillings for a double Sheet, each Sheet to contain as much as was contained in a Sheet of the Journals printed in the Year 1759" (JHR, June 5, 1767). In all of these editions, Green &amp; Russell used type of the same size. However, the area of the type-page had declined from about 41 square inches in 1759 to about 32 square inches in 1766. In 1767, it occupied about 51 square inches. Green &amp; Russell, at this time, also enjoyed a good deal of printing business from the Customs Board, but they eventually found that it was not possible to retain the Whig trade. As Schlesinger points out, "On the Board's confidential advice they declined to publish the 'Farmer's Letters,' and this fact, coupled with the stigma of running a subsidized press, soon lost them the bulk of their subscribers, as well as the work of the House of Representatives with considerable other trade." 5 The House shifted its printing to those "trumpeters of sedition," Edes &amp; Gill; on June 23, 1769, it ordered that "Edes &amp; Gill be the Printers of the Journals of this House the present Year: They having agreed to print them for Twenty-four Shillings for a Sheet; each Sheet to contain as much as was contained in a Sheet of the Journals of the House of Representatives, printed in the Year 1759." These terms obtained until August, 1775 (Arc., CCLV, 34, 72). The Council's printing remained in the Draper family during these years. When Richard Draper died on June 5, 1774, his widow, Margaret submitted this petition: Province of the Massachusetts Bay To his Excellency Thomas Gage Esquire, Governor &amp; Commander in chief of said Province &amp;c. &amp;c. and to the Honorable his Majesty's Council. The Petition of Margaret Draper Humbly Shews, That for more than Eighty Years past, the Printing Business ordered by the Governor &amp; Council of this Province, has been done by her late Husband, his Father, and Grandfather, during their several Lives, and she humbly hopes, at least so far as during the Lifetime of her late Husband, she may be permitted to say it was done with Approbation &amp; intire Satisfaction. That as all the Materials for carrying on the Business is left in her Possession for her Use, and she having Persons engaged therein every way qualified for carrying it on, and Your Petitioner having no other way to obtain a Support in Life, she is Advised to Apply, and humbly to Request Your Excellency &amp; Honors, that she may be continued in the Business which her late Husband, and his Ancestors, for so great a number of Years transacted for the Government, with so much faithfullness. Your Petitioner therefore most humbly Prays that Your Excellency &amp; Honors would be pleased to take her Distressed circumstances into consideration, so far as to employ her in Your Public Printing Business, which if she should be so happy as to obtain, her utmost Abilities and best endeavors shall always be exerted to discharge her Duty therein, with Faithfullness. And Your Petitioner (as in Duty Bound) Will Ever Pray &amp;c. Margaret Draper 6 The Council, with many more important problems before it, probably spent little time on this matter; Margaret Draper became "Printer to His Excellency the Governor, and the Honorable His Majesty's Council." A year later, 1775, with the government at Watertown, Benjamin Edes became "Printer to the Honorable Council, and Honorable House of Representatives." The House of Draper had finally ceased as government printers when the Whigs secured control. Although they ordered the printing of some documents, the three Provincial Congresses shunned any publicity about much of their actions and therefore refrained from ordering the printing of the complete Journal. However, during the next meeting of the General Court, the House of Representatives, on August 9, 1775, ordered Benjamin Edes to print five hundred copies of its Journal at 28 s per sheet. Bibliographically speaking, the most puzzling of all the Journals is that of the 1776-77 session: no complete copy exists and some parts were reset. Unfortunately, the bills for this edition cannot be located in the Archives. According to the Journal, the House voted, on October 29, 1776, that its committee agree with Powars &amp; Willis to print five hundred copies at 27 s per sheet. Few, if any, sheets were printed; on December 11, the House ordered that the committee formerly appointed to agree with a printer be "directed to get the journals printed in the most expeditious way." Powars &amp; Willis were evidently unable to keep up production; on June 20, 1777, the Court resolved that the Journals for 1776 be printed and appointed a committee to agree with a printer. Finally, on May 30, 1778, the House voted that " Powars and Willis be allowed for printing the Remainder of the Journals of 1776, which are not yet printed, the same Price that Messi'rs Fleet 's have for printing the Journals of the present Year." After the Fleets took over the printing of the Journal, the House ordered a committee to investigate the "Grant made some Time since, to Mr. Boyce to enable him to carry on the Paper-making Business, and to devise some Way of supplying the Printers of the General Court with Paper" (JHR, October 17, 1777). Herein may be the clue to the troubles of Powars &amp; Willis. The severe shortage of paper forced the printers to issue an edition smaller in size and number of copies. They continued to make do with the paper available until the arrival of more paper permitted them to increase the size and then reprint some of the sheets. For printing 560 copies of the Journal for the May, 1777, session, T. &amp; J. Fleet charged £4 per sheet, "each Page comprising more than double of some formerly printed" (Arc., CCLVIII, 45). Soon they, too, found themselves victims of the paper situation. When they submitted the bill for the sheets of the sessions from August to December, 1777, they included an extra charge of 16 s per ream for the paper (Arc., CCLIX, 41). In the following year, the agreement with the House stated the charge for paper and printing to be £5 per sheet, "provided Paper can be got at the Price it is now at. If Paper rises to be allowed therefor, and if it falls they to make an Abatement accordingly" (JHR, May 30, 1778). The scarcity of paper became so great that, on February 27, 1779, the Court directed the Board of War to import a limit of one thousand reams of printing and writing paper. By April, the Fleets found themselves beset by the general inflation as well as the price of paper: State of Massachusetts Bay. To the Honorable House of Representatives of said State. Humbly Shew Thomas &amp; John Fleet, Printers, That on the 30th of May 1778 they engaged to print your Honors Journals, and the Resolves of the General Court, on the same Terms they were printed the Year before, viz. at £5—per Sheet for 500 Sheets, and to have an Allowance in case Paper should rise.—That the Price of Paper at that Time was 30/, per Ream, which left £3.10. per Sheet for the Labor of the Printers, Use of the Press, Types, Ink, Firing, Rent, &amp;c. &amp;c.—That since that Time the Price of Labor has risen so high, and the Necessaries of Life so exceedingly enhanced, that the amount of Journeyman's Wages only for printing one Sheet is upwards of £10—exclusive of Paper.——Your Petitioners therefore being such great Sufferers by continuing the Printing [of] this Part of the Public Business, cannot help troubling your Honors at this Time with their Petition, and humbly pray that your Honors would consider their Case, and grant them such further Allowance, at least for printing the Doings of the last &amp; present Session as in your Honors Wisdom and Justice you shall think Reasonable, and your Petitioners as in Duty bound will ever Pray. Thomas &amp; John Fleet. Boston April 20. 1779. It will take three Hands two Days to compleat one Sheet, which at 36/. per Day each is £10.16— 7 Eight days later, the General Court responded with a resolution allowing them 10/10/- per sheet "including the rise of paper and the Five pounds per sheet already granted." The Fleets could do nothing more about that contract, but when the new session began in May, they held out for a better price. The committee appointed to agree with a printer for the Journals and Resolves of the 1779 session reported that "Messieurs Fleet and Gill , would print five hundred copies of the resolves and journals respectively, at thirteen pounds per sheet" (JHR, May 31, 1779). This report, which was accepted by the House, also stated that Benjamin Edes would print the Laws on the same terms. Evidently both House and printers veered from comprehensive commitments, which was logical because of the heavy investment required for paper. Even so, the General Court, on December 18, 1779, advanced £200 each to Thomas Fleet and John Gill to enable them to procure paper. The committee appointed by the 1780 session in reporting that Nathaniel Willis would print the Resolves for £54 for five hundred sheets declared almost apologetically that "it was their opinion his terms were reasonable" (JHR, June 1, 1780). However, faced with the great increase in price, the committee stated that it was not expedient to print the Journals of the House. The House, concurring with the committee, took no action, but, five months later, the committee appointed to consider printing the Laws and Resolves was directed "to see what additional expense the printing of the Journals will be attended with" (JHR, November 2, 1780). Eight days later, a committee was directed to agree with a printer for printing the Journals "so far as they relate to the organization of this House." Nathaniel Willis secured the work at "nine Shillings L. M. of the old emission for each Sheet" (JHR, November 28, 1780). Although Willis probably thought himself protected by the specification of the money, he, too, became a victim of the deteriorating financial situation. On July 2, 1781, he petitioned to have his accounts settled because he needed the money for paper (JHR, July 2, 1781; Arc., CCXXXIV, 104). The resolution requesting the Governor to grant a warrant for payment points up the monetary problem: it directed the Treasurer, "if he pays the Memorialist in paper money, to pay him in Bills of the New Emission on which no Interest has been paid" (Arc., CCXXXIV, 103). Soon after the 1782 session convened, the House appointed the usual committee to consider the expediency of printing the Resolves and the Journals. Again the prices were prohibitive; when the House heard the rates proposed, it ordered the printing of the Acts and Resolves, but not of the Journals (JHR, June 6, 1782). The negotiations between the committee and the printers provide a glimpse into the practice of government printing at that time. Soon after the committee was appointed, it received the following letter: Boston, June 3, 1782 Gentlemen, The Subscribers presuming no one Printer in Town can do all the public Work; and as they should not attempt to engross the whole, for the above Reason—They would undertake for their part to continue publishing the Laws, as usual, at Four Pence per Sheet —If these Terms should be approved of by the Committee, they stand ready further to serve the Public. We are, Gentlemen, Your humble Servants Benjamin Edes &amp; Sons 8 Six days later, the committee made this agreement: June 9th 1782 Agreed with Tristram Dalton Esquire, Chairman to the Committee, to print the Laws which may pass the General Court for this year commencing ye 29th May last—at four pence per Sheet — to be done in ye usual way — and delivered to the Clerk of the House of Representatives or as the Court may order — &amp; in due season four hundred Setts to be printed Benjamin Edes &amp; Sons 9 The Resolves were printed on the following terms: The Subscriber agrees with a Committee of the honorable House of Representatives, — Tristam[ sic ] Dalton, Esquire Chairman, appointed for that Purpose, that he will print the Resolves that have or may pass the General Court the Year ensuing, commencing the 29th of May last, in the usual Way and Manner, with a Table to the same — Also, the Resolves in his News-Paper as they are deliver'd him, and send one of his said weekly News-Papers to the Town-Clerk of each Town in this Commonwealth — on the following Terms — The Resolves at four Pence per Sheet—those put in his News-Paper at usual Prices of Advertisements—the Papers sent to the Towns being gratis.—The Resolves to be printed as fast as a Sheet can be filled — Six hundred &amp; fifty of each Sheet to be printed, and to be deliver'd to the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or as the General Court may order — N. Willis Boston, June 8, 1782. 10 In this way the General Court secured immediate distribution of its Resolves. Neither Willis nor Edes held the government business. When, in the following June, the House voted to print the Acts and Resolves but not the Journals, Adams &amp; Nourse did the printing at 1½ d per sheet (JHR, June 5, 1783; June 10, 1783). On January 1, 1784, Thomas Adams and John Nourse purchased the Independent Chronicle from Nathaniel Willis, thereafter securing a very good share of the government's business until Nourse's death in 1790. The derangement resulting from the Revolutionary War had ended, permitting a more orderly conduct of affairs. Nevertheless, Adams &amp; Nourse did not find the government an ideal customer. They had to be alert to competition, for the business was placed on a temporary basis and other printers constantly solicited for work; the volume of work varied, depending, for instance, on whether or not the Journals were printed; the government did not pay promptly. Finally, perhaps the most serious threat may be seen in an order of June 7, 1786, wherein the committee considering printers' proposals was "instructed to consider the expediency of governments providing themselves with a press of their own." This did not occur. However, all of these factors required the printers to cultivate governmental authorities and to keep prices within reason. Their price did not change in 1783, but in the following year it declined to 1 d per sheet for the Acts and Resolves and ¾ d for the Journals (JHR, June 9, 1784; June 14, 1784). In 1786, Adams &amp; Nourse agreed to perform the printing business of the General Court for 3/5 d per sheet, even though they first offered a price of 2/3 d per sheet. 11 The House had agreed to the higher price, but the Senate suggested the possibility of a government press as well as a reconsideration of the bids (JHR, June 7, 1786). Adams &amp; Nourse then reduced the price. Entirely different terms were agreed upon when negotiated the following year: Adams &amp; Nourse printed sets of the Acts and Resolves gratis in return for the privilege of all the other government printing as well as for official printing in their newspaper (at 3 s per square) (CR, June 23, 1787). They secured the same terms in 1788 (CR, June 14, 1788). By this time, they found that the burden of financing government printing was almost unbearable. In November, they submitted a petition declaring that "they are in very large advances per account of the Commonwealth—that notwithstanding the Resolve passed the 25th of March 1788, in which they among other Creditors, were intended to be provided for, they have not as yet been able to obtain any Monies from the Treasury — and that unless some speedy relief is afforded them they must be inevitably ruined" (CR, November 21, 1788). The General Court, after considering this petition, resolved "that the Treasurer of this Commonwealth be, &amp; he hereby is empowered &amp; directed to borrow the sum of one thousand pounds especially for the purpose of paying the same to the said Adams &amp; Nourse" ( Ibid. ). When the 1789 session began, a joint committee was appointed, as usual, to consider the printers' petitions. Again competition forced a reduction of prices: Adams &amp; Nourse were appointed "Printers to the Commonwealth," but the terms were 2 s per square for newspaper printing, government printing at ten per cent less than the previous year, and the sets of Acts and Resolves gratis (CR, June 17, 1789). Though the Commonwealth appears to have been a shrewd customer, it was also a sympathetic one. When, because of the deaths of John Nourse and David Bemis, the paper merchant, Thomas Adams found himself obliged to close the accounts of Adams &amp; Nourse, he petitioned the government for immediate payment. This time the General Court did not delay; it ordered the Treasurer to pay the money due the firm as soon as possible (CR, March 5, 1790). The members of the General Court finally tired of the cumbersome process of choosing a government printer; in 1790, they appointed a joint committee to consider a more suitable method. As a result of the report of this committee, the Court authorized the Secretary and the Clerks of the Senate and of the House of Representatives to contract for the printing business of the Commonwealth, "on reasonable terms, not to exceed the terms given the year past" (JHR, June 8, 1790). Similar resolutions passed both chambers in 1791, 1792, and 1793 (CR, June 7, 1791; June 18, 1793; JHR, June 26, 1792). In all of these four years, Thomas Adams became "Printer to the Honorable the General Court." However, maintaining the government printing contract on "the terms given the year past" proved too difficult. Adams eventually found that this could not be done. In 1793, he petitioned for additional payment, whereupon the Court, on June 22, resolved to pay him three hundred pounds "in consideration of the delay of payment aforesaid, &amp; of the very low terms on which the said Adams has executed the printing business of the Commonwealth a number of years past." This sum, it should be noted, was "in full of all compensations &amp; demands for the work aforesaid, previous to the month of January one thousand, seven hundred &amp; ninety two." To help in managing the business, Adams admitted Isaac Larkin to partnership on July 1, 1793, the firm name changing to Adams &amp; Larkin. At the beginning of the 1794 session, the General Court again decided to review its procedure for choosing a printer; another joint committee was appointed "to consider &amp; report at what rate the printing business can be performed the present year" (JHR, June 10, 1794). Again other printers, this time Young &amp; Minns and Joseph Belknap, submitted petitions (JHR, June 10, 1794; June 11, 1794). But the joint committee could not improve past practice; it reported a resolution directing the Secretary and Treasurer and Clerks of both Houses to contract for the printing. This resolution included the "not to exceed the terms given last year" clause as well as two additional conditions: that they give public notice of the time proposals will be received and that the contract will be awarded to the printer offering the most advantageous terms upon presentation of evidence that the printer is able to do the work (JHR, June 26, 1794). Adams &amp; Larkin retained the work, but the other printers continued to exert pressure. Within seven months, two reports on printing were submitted to the Court, one by the Treasurer and Clerk of the Senate, the other by the Secretary and Clerk of the House (JHR, January 15, 1795). The joint committee appointed to consider these reports recommended a new committee to contract for printing and the Senate approved of this, but the House non-concurred and ordered that "further consideration of the subject should subside" (JHR, January 22, 1795). One month later, the Senate again ordered that appointment of a committee to contract for the printing, but the House, after debate, ordered that "further consideration be referred to the next Session" (JHR, February 26, 1795). The people behind the Senate's persistence cannot be identified with certainty. However, it should be remembered that when the Senate issued the 1795 election sermon of Peres Fobes, Young &amp; Minns printed it. Adams &amp; Larkin held on to the government contract though they must have realized that their grip was insecure. On January 25, 1796, they petitioned for "further allowance for Services," only to be rebuffed by the committee's report that they have leave to withdraw their petition. The House did not accept this report, instead it voted to pay them in full for their services (JHR, February 16, 1796). The Senate concurred in paying them five hundred dollars, "they to be Accountable for the Same in the Settlement of their Accounts with the Commonwealth" (CR, February 29, 1796). In May, 1796, the General Court decided to try another method of selecting a printer, namely, by ballot. Word of this spread quickly; within a few days petitions for the printing business of the Commonwealth arrived from Edward E. Powars, Benjamin Sweetser, Benjamin Edes, and Young &amp; Minns (JHR, May 30, 1796; May 31, 1796). Probably to no one's great surprise, both Senate and House voted for Young &amp; Minns (JHR, May 31, 1796; CR, May 31, 1796). From that time through the end of the century, Alexander Young and Thomas Minns were "Printers to the State," or "Printers to the Honorable the General Court." Choosing a printer by ballot ended after the second year; the Court then reverted to the joint committee system. Young &amp; Minns apparently had no difficulty in holding the privilege until June, 1800, when Adams &amp; Rhoades submitted their petition "praying to be employed as Printers for the General Court" (JHR, June 3, 1800). The day after it was received, the Court ordered a joint committee "to confer with the printers who executed the printing business of the Commonwealth for the last year &amp; ascertain upon what terms they will contract to perform the same for the present year." One week later, a resolution reappointed Young &amp; Minns (JHR, June 12, 1800). The 1799 contract with Young &amp; Minns, renewed in 1800, presents such a detailed enumeration of printing costs that it is printed in Appendix I. The men thus far mentioned were by no means the only printers who worked for the government. During this half-century, the General Court called upon other printers for particular jobs when expedience or convenience required. This was especially true, of course, at the time of the Revolutionary War. Rather than detail their work here, it seems more worthwhile to discuss the large classes of government documents, introducing the names of some of the printers in the course of the discussion. From time to time, the Court issued compilations of the Perpetual and Temporary Laws, keeping them up-to-date with supplements as well as single copies if warranted. Because the publication of a compilation entailed comparatively great expense, proposals for new editions were carefully examined. Other factors such as bickering between House and Council or pressure from the booksellers also served to delay the appearance of a compilation. For example, the 1755 edition of the Temporary Laws resulted from a proposal by the Council in December, 1753, that a joint committee consider what should be done about the lack of complete sets of Temporary Laws (JHR, December 13, 1753). The joint committee suggested that the printers be directed to strike off a sufficient number of the out-of-print laws. The Council concurred in this report, but the House did not; instead it ordered that a joint committee be appointed to reprint the laws (JHR, January 23, 1754). The Council finally agreed to this, the volume appearing the following year (CR, April 9, 1754). Four years later, in 1759, the House, learning that the Perpetual Laws were no longer in print, ordered a committee to consider the matter (JHR, January 5, 1759). The committee found no copies available for sale and, after conferring with printers, reported that a new edition would not cost more than 2 d per sheet provided the Court would take about three hundred copies. It estimated that a bound volume would cost about 20 s. When the House received this report, it directed the committee to make further enquiry (JHR, January 19, 1759). The second report of the committee received an even cooler reception; the House ordered the report recommitted and that the committee "confer with some of the Stationers, to know of them, whether they would undertake a new Impression of the Perpetual Laws, they having an exclusive Patent, and on what Terms, and Report" (JHR, January 26, 1759). The House must have realized that the first price submitted was too high or perhaps Samuel Kneeland spread the word among the members. At any rate, he received the order to order to print three hundred copies and deliver them bound before August 1 at a price of 12 s per copy (CR, February 10, 1759). In 1762, the House ordered a committee to prepare a new impression of the Temporary Laws (JHR, May 28, 1762). By the time it appeared in the following year, Kneeland had lost the favor of the government and the printing went to Green &amp; Russell who submitted a bill for four hundred copies, each copy containing 52 sheets at 2 d per sheet (Arc., CCLIII, 162). Green &amp; Russell quickly seized the opportunity to hold on to this job. On June 16, 1763, the House directed them to print the Temporary Laws of the current session and on December 30 it resolved that they have the privilege of printing the Temporary Laws until further notice. Kneeland, seeing this work lost to him, then submitted the following petition: To the Honorable House of Representatives of His Majesty's Province of the Massachusetts-Bay, now sitting at Cambridge The Memorial and Petition of Samuel Kneeland of Boston, Printer, Humbly Shewing, That your Memorialist and Petitioner, desires to Represent to your Honours, that in effecting the late Impression of the perpetual Laws of this Province, ordered to be printed &amp;c. by the General Court 1758, by Reason of the large Number of Sheets, not expected by the Gentlemen, of the Committee concerned therein, nor your Petitioner, besides the addition of the Laws made since the Date of that Order; the unusual Price of Paper for printing, and Leather for binding, by reason of the late War, the Expence of white Paper necessary at the End of the Volumn ( sic ) whereby to affix the succeeding Sheets of Laws, and other Charges not provided for, by which, each Book stands him twenty five or twenty six Shillings, in the Judgment of others, knowing in the Business, and can testify the same; For these and other Reasons; besides the great Loss your Petitioner has sustained, by the Order for a new Impression of the temporary Laws, as he had by him near one Hundred compleat, except the Table, and which became as waste Paper to him—A Burden he is unable to bear —— —— Your Honours, will allow him to supplicate your wise just and compassionate Consideration, and allow him, with what he has received, what may be adequate to his Labour and Expence in the Affair. —— —— And your Petitioner shall ever pray January 27, 1764 Samuel Kneeland 12 The committee to which this petition was referred reported that further consideration be deferred until the next session when Kneeland would exhibit his accounts (JHR, February 3, 1764). On November 1, he submitted another petition asking liberty to present his account. This was granted, Kneeland sending in a bill for 414 copies at 25 s L. M. per copy (Arc., LVIII, no. 534a). Since £220 had already been paid on it, the balance amounted to 297/10/-. The Court voted him one hundred pounds on account, but it was not until 1765 that he was voted the balance of 197/10/- to complete payment on the 1759 compilation (JHR, November 3, 1764; CR, November 3, 1764; CR, February 18, 1765). At this period, signs of friction begin to appear. Upon receipt of a petition from Green &amp; Russell, the House voted, on February 19, 1765, to direct him to print the Perpetual Laws from time to time at 2 d per sheet. The Council concurred in this, but the Governor did not consent to it (CR, February 19, 1765). Matters soon became worse when the House realized that the Province was charged for the printing of unsavory laws. On January 17, 1766, a committee appointed to investigate the method of printing the laws of the Province reported that the Council had ordered Draper to print the Stamp Act and the Mutiny Act. With this information in hand, the committee considering the grievances of the people submitted these two, among others: 1. The Governor and Council printing the Stamp-Act and the Mutiny Act, especially against the known sense of this House, who had refused to be at the Expence of printing the Stamp Act, is a Grievance. 2. The printing Acts of Parliament at any Time at the Expence of this Province, and more especially when the sense of this House is known to be against it, as was the Case in the late printing the Stamp-Act, is bringing an unconstitutional Expence on this People, and a Grievance (JHR, January 20, 1766). A little more than a year later, the House again protested such payments for printing, insisting that "at least this ought to be done without expence to the province where such re-publications take place" (JHR, March 6, 1767). A minor result of the growing dissension was the failure to issue another compilation before the Revolution; in 1773, for example, "The Secretary according to Order attended the House, and being askd by the Speaker, Whether his Excellency had given his Assent to a Resolve of both Houses at the last Session of this Court, for the new Impression of the Province Laws? he answered that his Excellency had refus'd to give his Assent to said Resolve" (JHR, January 12, 1773). Furthermore, the government had ceased to allow only Green &amp; Russell to print the Laws; the Drapers and Green &amp; Russell jointly printed them. Thus the government shifted as much business as possible to the Draper firm. After the Revolution, compilations appeared again. In 1784, for instance, Adams &amp; Nourse received a contract to print twelve hundred sets of the Perpetual Laws at the rate of "one penny lawful money" per sheet (CR, March 23, 1784). And in 1788, when Isaiah Thomas presented his edition of the Perpetual Laws to the House, a resolution declared that "as it is the duty of the House of Representatives to promote the public Good by every means in their power, and as the encouragement of our manufactures is peculiarly the object of it it is with pleasure the House accept the Volume" (JHR, June 7, 1788). Along with the sporadic issue of compilations, the regular appearance of the volumes of Acts and Resolves continued beyond the eighteenth century. In addition to the various series thus far mentioned, the government ordered much job printing: proclamations, notifications, laws, resolutions, military orders, oaths, tax blanks, and all the other forms required for its purposes. For these items, the House and Council used their printers, or appointed a committee to agree with a printer, throughout the seventeenth-fifties and sixties. In this way, Edes &amp; Gill and Green &amp; Russell, having been selected by a committee, secured work at times when they were not official printers. In the seventeenseventies, orders to print were voted by House and Council as well as by the three Provincial Congresses and the Committees of Safety and Supplies. The records of the Provincial Congresses supply some interesting information and most impressive is the emphasis on rapid communication. It was not unusual for copies of documents to be sent to all towns and districts, but in these records the need for speed is observed in such phrases as " Ordered , That Mr. Gerry give the express going to the press, his orders for the enlisting papers," or "be published in all the newspapers in the province." 13 The Third Provincial Congress ordered a committee "to confer with the printers, Edes, Hall, and Thomas, and know of them respectively, upon what terms they will print handbills, and also such pieces as may be desired by this Congress to be put in the weekly papers" (PC, p. 349). Benjamin Edes, who moved his press to Watertown about May, 1775, received a good share of the work of the Provincial Congress, but other printers were also called upon. In Salem, Ezekiel Russel and the two Halls, Samuel and Ebenezer, put their presses to work for the Congress. The Committee of Safety and the Committee of Supplies also used the Halls' printing; on May 1, 1775, the Quartermaster-General was directed "to clear that chamber in Stoughton College, occupied by S. Parsons, Jr., for a printing office for Messrs. Halls" (PC, p. 530). Once installed at Cambridge, they resumed their work, as the following letter testifies: Cambridge May 13. 1775— Sir I have now sent a few Passes, the Rest will be sent Monday Morning. All the Hand Bills I have received to print have been immediately done, and forwarded to the Congress, or left at Head Quarters to be sent.— I printed 600 Passes, while at Salem, and forwarded them to the Congress, at the Bottom of which, by Order of the Rev. Mr. Murray, I printed the Name Joseph Ward , tho' in the Copy it was left Blank. I tho't his Order sufficient to deviate from the Copy, especially as he offered to be accountable if wrong.— I am Sir Your humble Servant Mr. Samuel Freeman Sam Hall 14 It should also be noted that the Committee of Safety and the Committee of Supplies also provided paper for Isaiah Thomas; on April 29, 1775, they sent four reams to him and on May 12, 1775, sixty reams of printing crown and eight reams of printing demy were supplied (PC, pp. 527, 542). When the General Court resumed on July 26, 1775, it concerned itself with military affairs, these matters being reflected in the orders for printing: fifty copies of the Resolve appointing committees to purchase guns, one thousand copies of a pamphlet containing the Militia Acts and the Rules and Regulations (JHR, February 16, 1776; April 23, 1776). In 1776, such work was sometimes given to Benjamin Edes, sometimes to John Gill. Since they performed these tasks under miserable conditions, the wonder is that a greater number of errors did not appear. Government documents, however, must be very accurate and when errors were found in a Fee Bill, the General Court took immediate action. On June 14, 1776, it directed the printer, probably Edes, to reprint the sheet containing the errors and the House appointed "a Committee to inspect the Press, until further Orders, and see that all Acts, Resolves and Journals, that are ordered to be printed by this House, are correctly done" (JHR, June 13, 1776; CR, June 14, 1776). The advent of the Revolution brought one typographical alteration in government documents; on December 7, 1776, the House ordered that "the words 'State of Massachusetts-Bay ' be inserted on the top of all acts and resolves that shall hereafter pass this Court." It also required more rapid production; in June, 1777, the General Court ordered that the Resolves be printed daily and distributed immediately (CR, June 16, 1777). This pressure for quick work did not cease; one year later, the House ordered a committee "to enquire of Mr. Gill respecting the printing of the Laws, and more especially the late Militia Law" (JHR, June 16, 1778). The press was the major medium of communication and the government realized that its efficiency had to be maintained. Very few printers's bills of the Revolutionary period have been preserved in the Massachusetts Archives; those which survive contain entries for printing Treasurer's Notes, receipts for collection of taxes by Constables, proclamations, and extra copies of resolutions, among other items such as charges for printing in newspapers. As prices went up, the House occasionally became more careful of its orders. On September 24, 1782, the Clerk was directed to find out what the printers would charge for printing 120 copies of a report on finances. When, in the afternoon, the House heard the Clerk, it voted not to print. Usually, however, the House continued to order the printing of whatever it thought necessary. The Journals, therefore, contain records of the printing of items for which bills do not now exist. After the Revolution, the mechanics of government became stabilized and there are fewer such references in the Journals. Far more interesting in content than these forms, reports, resolutions, and proclamations are the longer documents, usually pamphlets, which the government ordered printed. In them one sees the variety of subject matter which was even then required in official publications. During the seventeen-fifties, the House printed reports of the conferences with the Indians and even reprinted, in an edition of 250 copies, Governor Dummer's treaties of 1726 and 1727 (Arc. CCXLVIII, 120A, 148). Nor was domestic economy ignored; on March 1, 1765, the House, after hearing a report on A Treatise on Hemp-Husbandry , voted that it be printed. The report stated that the treatise "contains many suitable Instructions for the raising and manufacuring of Hemp, and may have a great Tendency to promote the Production thereof within this Province; and that it is advisable for this Court to order the printing of four hundred Copies . . . one for each Member of the General Court, and one for each Town or District Clerk . . . for the Use of the respective Towns and Districts . . . the remainder to be presented to Edmund Quincy , Esquire, as an acknowledgement for his Trouble in compiling the said Treatise." The records of the General Court also disclose that the Province evidently paid for the printing of the well-known Short Narrative of the Horrid Massacre (1770). On November 19, 1770, a motion to reimburse the Town of Boston for the cost of printing was introduced in the House and assigned to a committee. The next day, the House voted, on recommendation of the committee, that consideration be referred to the next session. When it was reconsidered in June, both House and Council voted to pay 49/-/6 to the Treasurer of Boston "in full Discharge of the within Account of Messi'rs Edes and Gill , and Messi'rs Thomas and John Fleet , which Sum has been advanc'd and paid by the said Town of Boston " (JHR, June 29, 1771; CR, July 2, 1771). Two years later, another document of the Revolution appeared when the House ordered that "the Speech of his Excellency the Governor to both Houses at the Opening of this Assembly, together with the several Answers of the Two Houses, and the whole Controversy thereon, be printed in a Pamphlet" (JHR, March 6, 1773). Of this pamphlet, Edes &amp; Gill delivered seven hundred to the House and one hundred to the Council at 2 s each (Arc. CCLV, 72). Parenthetically it should be stated that some documents were printed on the other side of the Atlantic. In March and April, 1774, Charles Say of London produced seven broadsides by Joseph Massie, accounts of trade and letters. These had been ordered by Dr. Franklin and were paid for by the Colony of Massachusetts. Franklin also ordered William Strahan to print another item. 15 Under the Second Provincial Congress, more pamphlets and documents appeared, two of which must have been eagerly read as they came from the press. One, Extracts from the Records of the Late Provincial Congress (1775) informed the public of official actions, the other told of what happened at Lexington and Concord. On May 8, 1775, the Congress appointed a committee "to transcribe the narrative of the proceedings of the king's troops, on the 19th ult., together with depositions . . . to be transmitted to Mr. Thomas for immediate publication." Two days later, another committee was appointed "to transcribe the depositions taken by a committee of this Congress, of the proceedings of the troops, under the command of general Gage . . . and that they transmit them to Mr. Hall, at Cambridge, to be published in a pamphlet." On the same day, it was ordered that a narrative be prepared as an introduction (CR, May 10, 1775). When, on May 19, the work was finished, another committee was directed to get it printed "on the best terms they can." It went to Isaiah Thomas; his edition of A Narrative of the Excursion (1775) is the first book printed in Worcester. After the General Court resumed in 1775, it issued, on the recommendation of the Continental Congress, Several Methods of Making Salt-Petre which Benjamin Edes printed at Watertown. In the following year, a pamphlet on the manufacture of salt, also recommended by the Continental Congress, was printed by John Gill in an edition of 150 copies (Arc. CCLVI, 177). Other pamphlets printed by the General Court during the Revolutionary War include various addresses to the people, rules for the army and navy, as well as The Proceedings . . . Relating to the Penobscot Expedition (1780). Once the War ended, the Court appears to have been reluctant to print any but official documents. In 1785, Richard Price's Observations on the Importance of the American Revolution received much attention in the United States after it appeared in London. However, when it was suggested that the House disperse it, a majority voted that consideration subside (JHR January 26, 1785). Even official documents met some opposition: when, in 1793, one hundred members of the House voted to publish and distribute the Constitution and Laws of the United States, forty members voted against the proposal (JHR, February 11, 1793). The farm bloc, nevertheless, was strong enough in 1797 to secure the passage of a resolution "directing the Printers of the Commonwealth to publish the proceedings of Agricultural Societies" (JHR, March 1, 1797). This, curiously enough, was also done in New York (Evans 34221). But undoubtedly there was little, if any, opposition to the publication of orations on George Washington by Fisher Ames and Peter Thacher in 1800. Another large class of publications comprises the Election and other occasional sermons. With a few exceptions, the Election sermons appeared annually and were distributed to the members of the General Court as well as to the parishes. For delivering the sermon, the minister received free copies, usually fifty or seventy-five, which he gave away, traded, or sold. During the final half of the eighteenth century, these sermons became political pamphlets; Swift, in his treatise, remarks that Down to the period immediately preceding the Revolution, the Election Sermons for many years (and this was true of them for some years before they were discontinued) had been preached perfunctorily, if ably. The time had come when they were to play an active part, and the spoken word from the political pulpit was to help sway men's decisions. 16 The occasional sermons printed officially include such items as Samuel Mather's sermon on the death of the Prince of Wales in 1751, Joseph Sewall's on the reduction of Havana in 1762, William Gordon's on the first anniversary of the Declaration of Independence (for which he received one hundred copies) (JHR, July 5, 1777), and Peter Thacher's at the funeral of Governor Increase Sumner in 1799. At least once, a printed sermon was presented to the House. According to the Journal for February 9, 1784: Information being received by the Messenger that a number of copies of President Willard's Thanksgiving Sermon delivered Dec. 11th 1783, and printed for his Excellency the Governor were ready to be presented to the Members of the House. Resolved that the thanks of this House be given to his Excellency for his polite attention in this instance. During the period covered by this paper, therefore, the government publications of Massachussets encompassed all the phases of government printing to-day: journals, laws, resolutions, documents, and miscellaneous publications. The printers, sometimes operating under most difficult conditions, managed to maintain output, if not quality. Though within these fifty years, the government itself changed by revolution from a colonial body to a state government, official printing never ceased. And, by 1800, it had become pretty well systematized. The bills abstracted in Appendix II supply detailed information about the prices for printing. Boston, engaging in trade rather than exchanging a domestic staple, did not have the prices-current which appeared in other towns and it is, therefore, very difficult to establish prices. 17 Furthermore, prices during the Revolution are even more difficult to determine because of the inflation. And so these bills are presented in the hope that they may be useful to students of economics as well as students of the history of printing.</field>

Bacon The license, for a period of ten years, is mentioned in C.S.P.Dom., 1603-1610, Vol. XXV, 55, under date 13 August 1608, with reference to Grant Book , p. 37. 1 One of the vexatious questions confronting King and Parliament after the accession of James was that of the civil rights of Scots in England. A test case was finally arranged, in which the guardians of one Robert Calvin, born after James became King of England, should sue Richard and Nicholas Smith for land in Middlesex that they were withholding from him. After much parliamentary debate in 1606/7, the case was transferred to the Exchequer, where it was argued at length, so that it might be decided by law rather than by statute. 2 Public interest may be estimated by the numerous manuscripts that have survived with reports of the speeches of Bacon, Coke, Yelverton, and others. It may be presumed that Sir William Woodhouse saw an opportunity to benefit himself by securing the exclusive right to publish the account of the proceedings, and certainly he succeeded at least to the extent of obtaining a royal grant. The history of his proposed book appears to end there. It is not referred to in the Registers of the Stationers' Company or in their Court Book C; nor has any copy been identified in the Short Title Catalogue . 3 The case of the Post Nati is reported at length in La Sept Part of Coke's Reports (1608; STC 5511) and in Sir Francis Moore's posthumously published Cases Collect &amp; Report (1663); the speeches of Bacon in the House of Commons and his arguments in the Exchequer were ultimately published; and there are other printed references to the case. Only one contemporary book, however, is devoted exclusively to the Post Nati. 4 That is The Speech of the Lord Chancellor of England, Touching the Post-nati , issued "for the Societie of Stationers, 1609" ( STC 7540). In his preface, the aged statesman explains how the book happened to be written and published: [A 5 v ] The decree and iudgement being thus passed, diuerse vnperfect Reports, and seuerall patches and pieces of my Speech / [A 6] haue bin put in writing, &amp; dispersed into many hands, and some offred to the Presse. The Kings M ie. hauing knowledge thereof, misliked it, &amp; thereupon cõmanded me to deliuer to him in writing, the whole discourse of that which I said in that Cause. Thus I was put to an vnexpected new labour, to reuiew my scribled &amp; brokẽ papers. Out of which (according to the charge imposed vpon me) I gathered all which I had before spoken, &amp; so set it downe faithfully &amp; plainly, and (as neare as I could) in the same words I vttered it; it pleased his sacred M ie. to take some view of it, &amp; taking occasion thereby, / [A 6 v ] to remember the diligence of the L. chiefe Iustice of the common place, for the summarie report he had published of the Iudges Arguments, 5 he gaue mee in charge to cause this to be likewise put in Print, to preuent the Printing of such mistaken and vnperfect reports of it, as were already scattered abroad. Was Woodhouse's book one of those choked off by this action of the King? In his instructions to Egerton, King James could hardly have been unmindful of his grant to Woodhouse. Are we to suppose that he instructed Egerton to hand over his manuscript to Woodhouse, who, lacking experience as a publisher, sold his rights to the Company of Stationers? As we have seen, Egerton's Speech bears in its imprint the name of "the Societie of Stationers" as the publisher, without reference to Woodhouse or his grant. The Company of Stationers, who, as Professor Jackson has pointed out, generally resisted the encroachments of private individuals that had received royal patents and in several instances—that of John Speed's Geneologie of the Holye Scriptures ( STC 23039) is a conspicuous example—bought them out 6 , would doubtless have welcomed the opportunity to acquire title. And having done so, the Company might be expected to suppress all references to Woodhouse and his patent. All this may have happened, but I doubt it. It would, I think, have been incompatible with the dignity of Lord Chancellor Egerton to have his book published under such auspices. 7 It seems to me more probable that Woodhouse's book was found to be inaccurate or inadequate—possibly at the time it was offered for licensing—and that publication was blocked by the issuance of Egerton's Speech at royal behest.</field>

On 4 May 1604, he and his heirs were granted the new park of Leicester, alias the Frith and Bird's Nest, part of Lord Cobham's land (C.S.P.Dom., 1603-1610, Vol. VIII, No. 10). 2 See C.S.P.Dom., 1603-1610, pp. 349, 350, 351, 352, 428, 438, 473.

The Lord Keeper replied stiffly that he had "parted with a friend and such a secretary as was fitter to serve a king than a subject, yet that, though he was unfeignedly sorry for what he had done, it was inconsistent with his place and credit to discharge and readmit servants at the request of passionate petitioners" (Augustus Jessop, John Donne , pp. 25-6).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Hospitall of Incurable Fooles by William E. Miller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his article on Thomas Nashe in the Dictionary of National Biography , Sir Sidney lee wrote that Nashe "has been doubtfully credited with a translation from the Italian of Garzoni's 'Hospitall of Incurable Fooles', a satiric essay published by Edward Blount in 1600. But Blount seems to claim the work for himself." Discussing the identity of the translator in his introduction to The Works of Thomas Nashe , R. B. McKerrow remarked that he did "not understand the statement in the D.N.B. article on Nashe, that 'Blount seems to claim the work for himself'." 1 The title of the book in full is The hospitall of incurable fooles : erected in English, as neer the first Italian modell and platforme, as the vnskilfull hand of an ignorant Architect could deuise . I pazzi, é li prudenti, fanno giustissima bilancia . Printed by Edm. Bollifant, for Edward Blount . 1600 . It was entered in the Stationers' Register on March 8, 1599/1600. 2 McKerrow included in his remarks a collation of the book, broken into details for the preliminaries. He found the order of the book to be A 4 a 2 B-X 4 (X4 blank). The preliminaries he listed as follows: "A2-2 v 'To the good old Gentlewoman, and her special Benefactresse, Madam Fortune, Dame Folly (Matron of the Hospitall) makes curtesie, and speakes as followeth.' A3-4 v 'Prologue of the Author to the beholders.' (From the Italian.) a1-2 v 'Not to the wise Reader.' (Signed 'II pazzissimo'.)" This analysis reveals the source of McKerrow's failure to comprehend Lee's remark: one of the preliminaries had escaped his notice. In three copies of the work which I have examined there is a letter, not mentioned by McKerrow, entitled "To my most neere and Capriccious Neighbor." 3 The letter is printed on both sides of an inserted single leaf, which is unsigned. Though the leaf is to be found in at least two (probably three) positions relative to the other preliminaries, it must be genuine. 4 The best evidence for the fact (aside from the inclusion of the leaf in several copies of the work) is the decorative initial "I", which appears also in the dedication to Madam Fortune on sig. A2. In view of the fact that the letter seems important in any discussion of Nashe's part in the translation of the piece, and because it is brief, it will perhaps not be amiss to present it complete. TO MY MOST NEERE and Capriccious Neighbor, ycleped Iohn Hodgson , alias Iohn Hatter , or (as some will) Iohn of Paules Churchyard, ( Cum multis alijs quae nunc imprimere longum est :) Edward Blount; wisheth prosperous successe in his Monomachie, with the French and Spaniard . Iohn of all Iohns, I am bould heere to bring you into a guest-house or Hospitall, and to leaue you there; not as a Patient, but as a Patron or Treasurer: I could wish, that vpon this sudden calling to such an office, you would not (like one swolne with the fatnesse of your place) grow bigger or prouder, nor (indeede) more couetous then you are: but like a man within compasse, whose bare (or rather thread-bare) content is his kingdome, tread all Ambition vnder your Ancient shooe soales, now the sixteenth time corrected, Et ab omnibus mendis purgatas . Stay now; for your charge: you shall sweare to the vttermost of your endeuours, without fraude or imposture to releeue and cherish all such creatures as are by the hand of Fortune committed to your custodie, as also to elect and choose officers of good reputation and sincere practise to supply inferiour places vnder you as: a Porter, who shall refuse none that are willing to enter; a surgeon, that will protract the cure long ynough vpon them, and that if any desperate Censurer shal stab either at you or me, for vndertaking, or assigning this office or place, you presently take him into the darke ward, and there let him be lookt to, and kept close as a concealment, till some bodie beg him; all this you shall faithfully protest to accomplish: So helpe you a fat Capon, and the Contents of this Booke. It appears that scholars have been doubtful of the identity of John of Paul's Churchyard. As McKerrow said, ". . . it seems not to be certainly known what he or it was." 5 It can now be said with considerable confidence that John of Paul's Churchyard was John Hodgson, a hatter and haberdasher, 6 who evidently was gifted with a well marked personality. A John Hodgson, probably identical with Blount's neighbor, is on the tax list for St. Faith's Parish, Ward of Farringdon Within, dated 1 October 41 Elizabeth [1599]. 7 Hodgson was assessed at three pounds and taxed eight shillings, a substantial amount. The church of this parish was St. Faith's Under St. Paul's, and it is likely that John Hodgson was a member of it, for it "serued for the Stacioners and others dwelling in Paules Churchyard, Pater noster row , and the places neare adioyning." 8 At about the same time Edward Blount had his shop in St. Paul's Churchyard, "Over against the Great North Door" (Arber, V, 198). The man honored by this burlesque dedication was mentioned in the works of at least two authors better known than Blount. In the epistle "To the Reader" prefixed to Thomas Middleton's Father Hubburd's Tales : or, the Ant and the Nightingale (1604), the writer testifies: ". . . by John of Paul's-churchyard, I swear, and that oath will be taken at any haberdasher's, I never wished this book better fortune than to fall into the hands of a true-spelling printer, and an honest-minded bookseller . . . ." Again the author says: "Here I began to rail, like Thomas Nash against Gabriel Harvey, if you call that railing; yet I think it was but the running a tilt of wits in booksellers' shops on both sides of John of Paul's churchyard; and I wonder how John scaped unhorsing." 9 Thomas Dekker paid his respects to the celebrity in The Gull's Hornbook (1609). Instructing the gallant how to behave himself in Paul's Walks, he wrote: ". . . Powles may be pround of him, Will Clarke shall ring forth Encomiums in his honour, Iohn in Powles Church-yard , shall fit his head for an excellent blocke, whilest all the Innes of Court reioyce to behold his most hansome calfe." 10 The source of the attribution of The Hospitall to Thomas Nashe seems to be no better than a mysterious memorandum in a copy of the work: "Tho. Nashe had some hand in this translation and it was the last he did as I heare P. W." 11 The style of the original parts (all of the preliminaries except "Prologue of the Author to the beholders") and that of the translated portions, alike lead to confirmation of McKerrow's conclusion that ". . . there is . . . not the slightest trace of evidence, external or internal, to connect Nashe's name with the book" (Nashe, V, 141). There is nothing that I can find in the method of expression that has more than a superficial resemblance to Nashe's helter-skelter vigor and allusiveness. Finally, there seem to be strong grounds for doubt that Nashe knew enough Italian to translate a book from that language into English. McKerrow remarked that he could not help thinking "that if Nashe had had any acquaintance with languages he would have been careful to apprise us of the fact" (Nashe, V, 133). The translator of the book remains unknown. It was probably not Nashe. It may have been Blount, but nothing in the dedicatory letter to John Hodgson reveals the writer of it as the translator of the book. The only evidence known to me that can be used to support Blount's claim is that he presumably knew Italian and translated from that language into English, since he is credited with the translation into English of the Arte Aulica of Lorenzo Ducci (English title: Ars Aulica, or the Courtier's Arte , 1607), and that as its publisher he might have found it convenient and economical to translate The Hospitall of Incurable Fooles himself.</field>

Undoubtedly, John of Paul's Churchyard was in danger of unhorsing, not as a partisan of either Nashe or Harvey, but as the keeper of a shop situated in the place of literary combat. Garzoni, like Nashe, was probably influenced by Rabelais (cf. the catalogue of fools in book III, chapter XXXVIII of Gargantua and Pantagruel ), but there is no reason to believe that the translator was.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Text of "The Eve of St. Agnes" by Jack Stillinger</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first edition of H. W. Garrod's The Poetical Works of John Keats (Oxford, 1939) was published with some 135 errors and omissions 1 in the apparatus criticus to "The Eve of St. Agnes." About twenty substantive variants were left unrecorded, and there were some forty misprints and mistakes in transcription, thirty-five instances of wrong or incomplete sigla, and forty other errors in description of the various manuscripts underlying the printed text. While it might be supposed that some of these would have been corrected in the recent second edition (1958), the fact is that not a single remedial change was introduced. But there is a more worrisome matter concerning the soundness of the text itself—not only Garrod's but all printed texts of Keats's poem—a matter that depends not so much on a rechecking of the manuscripts (for the facts surrounding the text have for some time been available) as on an editor's judgment. At least since the publication of Amy Lowell's biography (1925) it has been known that Keats's publishers enforced changes in the language of the poem; but so far no editor has attempted to repair Keats's text or in any way depart from the version first printed, in the Lamia volume of 1820. Keats first drafted the poem during the last two weeks of January (and perhaps also the first week or so of February) 1819. His original manuscript (Garrod's H , now in the Harvard Keats Collection) was twice copied by Richard Woodhouse, legal and literary adviser to Keats's publishers, in the transcripts designated by Garrod as W 1 and W 2 (both are at Harvard). The evidence for the order of these independent copies is ambiguous, but W 1 , showing a few more errors and more blank spaces where Keats's manuscript could not be read, would seem to be the earlier; W 2 is dated by Woodhouse 20 April 1819. Early in September Keats revised the poem and had it "copied fair." 2 His fair copy, presumably the one sent to the publishers, is now lost, but in the following January, perhaps on the 15th (see Letters , II, 243), George Keats copied it in the transcript known as E (British Museum), and sometime before or afterward—probably both 3 — Woodhouse read it and entered corrections and variant readings (designated w by Garrod) between the lines and opposite the text of W 2 . "The agreement . . . of E and w ," writes Garrod (2nd edn., p. xli), disregarding the question of variants between them, and actually intending to include the agreement of E with the other manuscripts as well, "represents Keats' fair copy. . . . Any divergence of 1820 from Ew must be interpreted as a change made in proof either by Keats himself or by his publishers." Not counting copyist's errors, there are more than forty such substantive "divergences"; it is a nice question, in each instance, whether Keats or his publishers were responsible. Concerning a few of them, however, I think it is time we reached a decision. On 12 September 1819 Keats read the revised form of the poem to Woodhouse, who gave the following report to the publisher John Taylor in a well-known letter of September 19 ( Letters , II, 162-163): He [Keats] had the Eve of S t A. copied fair: He has made trifling alterations, inserted an additional stanza early in the poem to make the legend more intelligible, and correspondent with what afterwards takes place, particularly with respect to the supper &amp; the playing on the Lute.—he retains the name of Porphyro—has altered the last 3 lines to leave on the reader a sense of pettish disgust, by bringing Old Angela in (only) dead stiff &amp; ugly. . . . There was another alteration, which I abused for "a full hour by the Temple clock." You know if a thing has a decent side, I generally look no further—As the Poem was orig y written, we innocent ones (ladies &amp; myself) might very well have supposed that Porphyro, when acquainted with Madeline's love for him, &amp; when "he arose, Etherial flush d &amp;c &amp;c (turn to it) set himself at once to persuade her to go off with him, &amp; succeeded &amp; went over the "Dartmoor black" (now changed for some other place) to be married, in right honest chaste &amp; sober wise. But, as it is now altered, as soon as M. has confessed her love, P. winds by degrees his arm round her, presses breast to breast, and acts all the acts of a bonâ fide husband, while she fancies she is only playing the part of a Wife in a dream. This alteration is of about 3 stanzas; and tho' there are no improper expressions but all is left to inference, and tho' profanely speaking, the Interest on the reader's imagination is greatly heightened, yet I do apprehend it will render the poem unfit for ladies, &amp; indeed scarcely to be mentioned to them among the "things that are." Of the three revisions here specified (apart from the change of the hero's name), only one should cause us difficulty, the alteration of the last three lines. In all extant versions, from the first draft on, Angela is brought in (in a sense) "dead stiff &amp; ugly," and always accompanied by the Beadsman, whose death is a similarly grotesque affair. In HW 1 W 2 and the 1820 text, "meagre face deform" describes Angela; through a change in punctuation the corresponding phrase in Ew ("with face deform") is made to apply to the Beadsman. But in no extant version is Angela "only" introduced. One could suppose a lost ending, but I rather think that Woodhouse, who heard the revised version but obviously had not yet read it, and who, furthermore, had been given plenty to think about by one of the earlier alterations that he describes, simply misunderstood the revised ending. In any event, the alteration (of whatever nature) has no place in the final text of the poem: beneath the variant ending ( w ) in W 2 Woodhouse wrote "Altered 1820." and two words in shorthand that are best read as "before March." 4 Presumably, before March 1820, when he was preparing his poems for publication, Keats restored the original conclusion of the poem. The other two alterations are a simpler matter. The "additional stanza" inserted "early in the poem" is of course that given in the Ew transcripts between the present stanzas VI and VII: 5 'Twas said her future lord would there appear Offering, as sacrifice—all in the dream— Delicious food, even to her lips brought near, Viands, and wine, and fruit, and sugar'd cream, To touch her palate with the fine extreme Of relish: then soft music heard, and then More pleasures 6 follow'd in a dizzy stream Palpable almost: then to wake again Warm in the virgin morn, no weeping Magdalen. The alteration that Woodhouse "abused for 'a full hour by the Temple clock'" was a revision of the present lines 314-322 to read: 7 See, while she speaks his arms encroaching slow, Have zoned her, heart to heart,—loud, loud the dark winds blow! For on the midnight came a tempest fell; More sooth, for that his quick rejoinder flows Into her burning ear: and still the spell Unbroken guards her in serene repose. With her wild dream he mingled, as a rose Marrieth its odour to a violet. Still, still she dreams, louder the frost wind blows. Because Woodhouse calls it an "alteration . . . of about 3 stanzas," Lowell, Garrod, and others have felt that the revised version to which he objected has been lost. But the lines just quoted fit all the other details of Woodhouse's description ("winds by degrees his arm round her, presses breast to breast, and acts all the acts of a bonâ fide husband, while she fancies she is only playing the part of a Wife in a dream. . . . there are no improper expressions but all is left to inference"). Woodhouse wrote " about 3 stanzas"; the revised lines affect two stanzas. If we again recall that Woodhouse had heard, not read, the poem when he wrote to Taylor, and also consider that the revised text, by setting off a train of uncomfortable thoughts in his mind, quite possibly would have seemed longer than it really was, it should become clear that the Ew lines we now possess are those that Woodhouse condemned as making the poem "unfit for ladies." In his reply to Woodhouse of September 25 ( Letters , II, 183), Taylor confessed that the account of this last revision excited in him "the Strongest Sentiments of Disapprobation," and he added: "Therefore my dear Rich d if he [Keats] will not so far concede to my Wishes as to leave the passage as it originally stood, I must be content to admire his Poems with some other Imprint." Clearly the publishers forced the restoration of the original lines 314-322, and it is almost as certain that they forced the rejection of the additional stanza inserted between VI and VII. Once the possibility of sexual references had been opened, the lines describing "More pleasures . . . in a dizzy stream," "virgin morn," and "weeping Magdalen" (very likely an allusion to the deserted unwed mother of Book VI of The Excursion , who is called "a weeping Magdalene" and "a rueful Magdalene" in lines 814, 987) would similarly have rendered the poem, by the publishers' standard, "unfit for ladies." Just as clearly, the revised lines and the additional stanza should be restored to the text of the poem. In a critical article 8 I have suggested ways in which these passages heighten the irony of Madeline's self-deception and clarify Keats's condemnation of "dreaming" (Madeline's engrossment in superstitious ritual to the point of losing touch with reality). More to the point here is Keats's recoverable intention in the matter of text. On the one hand, we know that he vigorously opposed Woodhouse's objections: "He says," Woodhouse noted in the same report to Taylor ( Letters , II, 163), "he does not want ladies to read his poetry: that he writes for men—&amp; that if in the former poem [i.e., the original version of the consummation] there was an opening for doubt what took place, it was his fault for not writing clearly &amp; comprehensibly—that he sh d despise a man who would be such an eunuch in sentiment as to leave a maid, with that Character about her, in such a situation: &amp; sho d despise himself to write about it &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c— and all this sort of Keats-like rhodomontade." On the other hand, to balance this, we have only Woodhouse's cryptic note in W 2 that "K. left it to his Publishers to adopt which [alterations] they pleased, &amp; to revise the Whole." One can imagine with what willingness (and in what tone of voice) Keats surrendered that privilege. Since an editor must always act according to principles, the problem facing an editor of Keats's poem is what, if he includes the Ew revisions so far discussed, he should do about the rest of the late manuscript readings that were rejected in 1820. A single example will serve to illustrate. In all extant transcripts the poem is called "Saint Agnes' [ or Agnes] Eve" (Garrod's first textual note is wrong), which was always Keats's form of the title in his letters (see Letters , II, 58, 62, 139, 157, 174, 234, 294; so also Charles Brown, II, 276). Woodhouse and Taylor use forms of the title "The Eve of St. Agnes" ( Letters , II, 162, 182), which appeared at the beginning of the poem, in the running heads, and on the title page and a half-title in the 1820 volume. Can we assume, then, that Keats's publishers altered the title? There is a strong possibility that they did alter it. Can we assume, if they did, that Keats disapproved of the change? No—because we know that he read proofs of the poem, and that in at least two instances (see Letters , II, 294-295) he insisted that his manuscript readings be restored. We can, I think, assume that he had a free hand wherever the publishers did not object specifically on moral or religious grounds. 9 To only three other readings could the publishers have objected on such grounds. (1) At line 98, for "Mercy, Porphyro!" the manuscripts (some of them without the comma) read "Mercy, Jesu!"—which, aside from being metrically preferable, lends force to Angela's suspicions (detailed in stanza XIV) that the Porphyro confronting her may be an evil spirit. (2) At line 143, again in Angela's speech, for "Go, go!" the manuscripts (with minor variations) read "O Christ!"—a natural enough reaction just after the "cruel . . . impious . . . wicked" Porphyro has proposed his "stratagem." (3) At lines 145-147, for "I will not harm her, by all saints I swear," Quoth Porphyro: "O may I ne'er find grace "When my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer, the manuscripts (with minor variations) read "I will not harm her, by the great Saint Paul—" Swear'th Porphyro—"O may I neer find grace "When my weak voice shall unto heaven call —which, owing to Paul's association with chastity, embodies an ironic oath especially appropriate to Porphyro's plot against Madeline, but would have aroused the same disapproval from the publishers as the sexual overtones of the additional stanza between VI and VII. The nearly forty other late manuscript readings that were ignored or rejected in 1820 have nothing in them offensive from a moral or religious point of view. The alterations are primarily stylistic, and in every instance we cannot be sure that Keats himself did not make the change in proof, or at least concur in the change if it was made by someone else. It is this circumstance that prevents us from always accepting the Ew agreement as Keats's final text: he could have been responsible for every single one of the stylistic alterations, from the title on. Employing the principle that a proper text of the poem will embody the latest readings intended by the poet, including those that there is good reason to think were rejected by the publishers against the poet's wishes, future editors of Keats's poem, whether making a scholarly text or putting together selections for an anthology, should restore the Ew version of lines 314-322 and the additional stanza between VI and VII—this last even though it will result in the subsequent renumbering of stanzas and lines through most of the poem. Editors may wish to restore the manuscript readings at lines 98, 143, and 145-147; at present, while I myself favor them, these seem a matter of individual option. Otherwise (saving for the need to tidy up the apparatus criticus in the next Oxford edition) the text we now have will serve. Keats at one time thought enough of "The Eve of St. Agnes" to request that it appear first among the poems in the 1820 volume ( Letters , II, 276). It seems less than fair not to accord it the best text possible; certainly the only slightly more innocent version we have always had, whether or not fit for ladies, has been often enough misunderstood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 This and the following figures (which do not, of course, include the omission of several hundred accidental variants among the manuscripts) are slightly understated to allow for disagreement in a few questionable readings. I am not here primarily concerned with Garrod's errors, which, amid a wealth of valuable detail, are relatively unimportant. 2 The Letters of John Keats , ed. Hyder E. Rollins (1958), II, 157, 162. This edition is hereafter cited parenthetically as Letters . 3 Again the evidence is ambiguous, for while E and w usually show the same revised readings, there are still several instances of disagreement between them in which 1820 agrees sometimes with E , sometimes with w , occasionally with neither. The readiest explanation would seem to be that Woodhouse entered the w readings at various times, perhaps some of them even after the poem was printed. 4 I am indebted (as always) to Miss Mabel A. E. Steele, Curator of the Harvard Keats Collection, who tells me that the shorthand notations seem to have been written hastily: "the second word is almost certainly 'March,' and, if we accept that reading, the first is probably 'before.' It breaks down into 'b,' the first part of either 'f' or 'x,' and what ought to be 'l,' because the stroke seems to go down. If it went up from the loop, stopping at the top, it would be 'r.'" 5 I quote the w version as the one more likely to represent the minutiae of Keats's lost copy accurately; the E transcript (reproduced in most respects faithfully by Garrod, p. 238 n.) shows nine variants in punctuation and spelling. In w the stanza is numbered "7"; with the "corrected Copy" before him Woodhouse struck through the original fourth stanza (see Garrod, p. 237 n.) and renumbered the next three stanzas "4," "5," and "6." In E , and presumably therefore in Keats's lost fair copy, all the stanzas were unnumbered. 6 So Ew ; Garrod's "pleasure" (2nd edn. only) is a misprint. 7 Again I transcribe the w text; the E version (followed except in three marks of punctuation by Garrod, p. 252 n.) shows eleven variants in punctuation and spelling, and has (as Garrod indicates) "close" for "quick" in the second line of the new stanza. In both E and w the last line quoted here ends with a comma. 8 "The Hoodwinking of Madeline: Scepticism in 'The Eve of St. Agnes,'" SP , LVIII (1961), 533-555; see especially pp. 544-545, 548-549. 9 The intense evangelicalism of Keats's otherwise amiable and worthy publishers is well illustrated in their letters written to Severn at Rome while Keats lay dying (see Hyder E. Rollins, More Letters and Poems of the Keats Circle [1955], pp. 109-118).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Some Unaccomplished Projects of Matthew Arnold by Roger L. Brooks</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The importance of calling attention to the unaccomplished projects of Matthew Arnold has been established by William E. Buckler. In the second section of his article "Studies in Three Arnold Problems" ( PMLA , LXXIII, 260-269), Buckler emphasized the significance of Arnold's unfinished "Guide to Greek Poetry," calling attention to its incomplete state as evidence of an inner struggle that eventually led to Arnold's questioning of the Hellenic ideal which he had earlier maintained. The scope of Buckler's study is limited to the "Guide to Greek Poetry," but the implications of his work are that the unaccomplished projects are as important as the accomplished ones when one is attempting to identify and understand the stages of Arnold's intellectual development, and like the reading lists and the excerpts from his reading collected in the Note-Books (London, 1952), when considered chronologically, they reveal something of the journey of the writer's mind. Between 1846 and 1888 Arnold planned many projects that appear never to have been completed. 1 Some were merely noted in lists of proposed works; others were left in various stages of completion. Heretofore, no attempt has been made to collect or enumerate these projects. The list which follows begins with Arnold's unfinished "Lucretius" in 1846, three years before the publication of The Strayed Reveller, and Other Poems in 1849, his first collection of poetry, and concludes with a proposed article in 1888 on the old age of George Sand, a total of forty-three years and twenty-one projects, encompassing the poetic as well as the prose career. During this period a variety of subject matter is treated in Arnold's most representative genres of writing. Consequently, with the unaccomplished projects the student of Arnold's intellectual development has additional evidence for his consideration. In addition, the list makes prominent several little known facts. A broader interest in the Celtic revival, especially Eisteddfods, is evident than is generally acknowledged. Having already reviewed Edward Dowden's Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley for the Nineteenth Century in 1888, Arnold planned an intense study of Shelley's poetry, a purely literary essay. And in 1888 Arnold's interest in the personal life of George Sand—it had waned somewhat after his tour of the Continent in 1859—was revived with the reading of her correspondence. More significant, however, is the comment that the list makes concerning Arnold's prose career. Heretofore, it has been thought that Arnold's turning to prose was formally announced with the publication in 1859 of "England and the Italian Question." However, items 3 and 4 of the list—the proposed essays on Hypatia and Oxford life— suggest a conscious interest on Arnold's part of writing prose as early as 1855. 2 The following list of twenty-one projects was compiled from information in Arnold's correspondence, notebooks, and works, works on Arnold, and, in two cases, the diaries of Lewis Carroll. The date in parentheses following the project is the earliest one on which the project is known to have been mentioned. Following the date is a description of the project in Arnold's own words, when they were available; otherwise, when there was evidence for doing so, an attempt has been made to suggest briefly what the nature of the work might have been. If there were an indication of the periodical or the publisher for which a work was intended, the name follows the description. Finally, all known references to the project are listed. One is not to presume that this list is definitive. 3 1. Lucretius (1846). "A tragedy of the time of the end of the Roman Republic" at which Arnold worked piecemeal for most of his life. ( Letters of Matthew Arnold 1848-1888 , ed. George W. E. Russell [1904], I, 65). The project is discussed and unpublished fragments are presented in C. B. Tinker and H. F. Lowry's The Poetry of Matthew Arnold. A Commentary (1950), pp. 340-347. 4 2. A first book to "Balder Dead" (December 12, 1855). An addition to his poem of "an account of the circumstances of the death of Balder himself" ( Letters I, 63). 3. An essay on Hypatia (March 10, 1856). At the request of Lewis Carroll, Arnold agreed to contribute to The Train an essay on Hypatia — presumably a discussion of Charles Kingsley's novel, which he had read and discussed with his wife ( Letters I, 49). A second edition of Kingsley's novel appeared in 1856. The Diaries of Lewis Carroll , ed. R. L. Green (1953), I, 80, 88. 4. An essay descriptive of Oxford life (June 20, 1856). Arnold proposed trying an essay on Oxford life for The Train at the request of its editor, Edmund Yates. The Diaries of Lewis Carroll , I, 88. 5. St. Martin (1863). Arnold's interest in Saint-Martin, the spiritualist philosopher, was probably a result of his study of Senancour. A. Jacques Matter's Saint-Martin le Philosophe inconnu, sa vie et ses ecrits appeared in Paris in 1862. Note-Books of Matthew Arnold ed. H.F. Lowry, Karl Young, and Waldo Hilary Dunn (1952), p. 569. 6. An article on Alexander Vinet (October 12, 1864). A discussion of the works of Alexander Vinet "in the manner of those on the Guerins ["Maurice de Guérin" Fraser's Magazine , January, 1863; "Eugénie de Guérin" Cornhill Magazine , June, 1863] for the National Review . Arnold's letter to George Smith, "Cobham. Saturday" in F.G. Townsend's "Literature and Dogma: Matthew Arnold's Letters to George Smith" ( PQ , XXXV, 198); Matthew Arnold's Books: Towards a Publishing Diary , ed. William E. Buckler (Genéve, 1958), pp. 68, 170 fn. 4; Arnold's letter to Bunting, July 23rd [1887], in Robert Liddell Lowe's "Matthew Arnold and Percy William Bunting: Some New Letters 1884-1887" ( Studies in Bibliography , VII, 207); Note-Books , pp. 577, 589, 591. 7. An article on Eisteddfods (November 7, 1864). The article was to be "in part personal observation" and "a mixture of description and reflexion" . . . "not above 12 pages" for the Cornhill Magazine. Matthew Arnold's Books , pp. 92, 172 fn. 12. 8. An article on Propertius (1865). A discussion of the works of the Roman poet Sextus Propertius "in the manner of those on the Guérins" for the Cornhill Magazine. PQ , XXXV, 198; Note-Books , pp. 577, 589. 9. On chivalrous sentiment (1865). This work was to have been written for the Cornhill Magazine. Note-Books , p. 577. 10. A review of Joseph Milsand's L'Esthétique anglaise, étude sur M. John Ruskin (February 17, 1865). This work was to have been one of two reviews that Arnold intended for the Pall Mall Gazette in 1865. Arnold's letter to Robert Browning, "Feby 17th, 1865," in John Drinkwater's A Book for Bookman (1927), p. 222; Note-Books , p. 577. 11. A letter to the Times (April 27, 1867?). This letter was to consist of "one or two points in which the educational figures and assertions of their [the Times' ] correspondents are misleading." Matthew Arnold's Books , p. 83. 12. A Guide to Greek Poetry (April 29, 1867). The work was to have been "a sort of sketch of the development of Greek poetry, illustrated by extracts in a plain translation into harmonious prose" for Macmillan ( Letters II, 177). Arnold worked sporadically at this work until 1872 when he dismissed it as something to be reserved for old age. The work is discussed in William E. Buckler's "Studies in Three Arnold Problems" ( PMLA , LXXIII, 260-269). 13. Aeschylus (1869). Arnold mentioned Aeschylus in his Oxford lecture "On the Modern Elements of Literature" in 1857. Evidently he intended to make a study of the poet's works. Note-Books , p. 585. 14. Récit d'une Soeur (May 29, 1869). The work was to have been "another such paper [as Eugénie de Guérin] for the Cornhill Magazine. Matthew Arnold's Books , pp. 155, 178 fn. 5; Note-Books , pp. 594, 626. 15. A Catholic family (1874). Note-Books , pp. 589, 591, 592. 16. Frederick Robertson (1874). Arnold proposed this article after having read Stopford Brooke's Life and Letters of Frederick W. Robertson . In 1865, at the appearance of the work, Arnold wrote to his mother of the religious nature of the biography and Dr. Arnold's influence upon Robertson. In 1869 Arnold wrote to his mother hoping "some day, in an article on Frederick Robertson to say something as to the character of the impulse which papa [Dr. Arnold] gave to the life and thought of the generation which felt his influence. . ." ( Letters II, 200). In 1873 the fifth edition of Brooke's biography appeared. Arnold owned Robertson's Sermons, Preached at Trinity Chapel (1856). Letters II, 65-66, 200; Note-Books , p. 589. 17. Broad Church in the Seventeenth Century (January 9, 1877?). Arnold proposed "a volume out of the best of [John] Hales and [Benjamin] Whichcote, and [Ralph] Cudworth's two sermons" with "twenty pages of introduction" for Macmillan. Letters III, 21; Matthew Arnold's Books , pp. 158-159; Note-Books , p. 594. 5 18. An edition of Emerson's works (May 21, 1882). Arnold proposed "a crown 8 vo . edition of Emerson" with "an introduction" for Macmillan. Evidently the work was to have been similar to John Morley's The Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson published by Macmillan in 1883. Matthew Arnold's Books , p. 160. 19. Vauvenargues (1887). Arnold had mentioned Vauvenargues in "A French Worthy" in 1882; he had read and excerpted extensively from the French writer's works during the period 1882-1888. Arnold owned Vauvenargues' Oeuvres (Paris, 1857). Note-Books , pp. 623, 626. 20. Shelley's poetry (1888). Before his death Arnold had proposed to Macmillan a purely literary essay on the poetry of Shelley. Matthew Arnold's Books , pp. 76, 79; Note-Books , p. 626; Matthew Arnold, Essays in Criticism. Second Series (1888), vi. 21. George Sand (February 12, 1888). After having read "the latter volumes of G. Sand's correspondence," Arnold planned "an article on the old age of George Sand." Volumes V and VI of the Correspondance had appeared in Paris in 1884. Letters III, 334.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The projects of this list appear never to have been published under the title or description that Arnold gave them. Some of Arnold's anonymous contributions to the periodicals of his day still remain to be identified; it may be that among those still undiscovered works some of what have been presumed unaccomplished will appear, after all, to have been accomplished. It may be, too, that some of the works became associated with and synthesized into Arnold's related thoughts, as was the case, William E. Buckler suggests, with "The Eisteddfods" — "it seems that [Arnold's] basic purpose in writing that article finally merged with his thoughts for 'My Countrymen'; and it may be, finally, that his thoughts on the two gave rise to the Celtic lectures in 1866" ( Matthew Arnold's Books , p. 172, fn. 12). 2 Arnold had published prefaces to Poems in 1853 and 1854 (reprinted in 1855 and 1857) and Merope in 1858; the purpose of these pieces, however, was to explain his position as a poet. 3 The major portion of Arnold's letters remains to be published. When something like completeness is given to the correspondence, it is likely that additional projects will be discovered. 4 The entries for sources of information in the text are given in full at their first appearance; thereafter, they are abbreviated. 5 That Arnold finally dismissed this project is suggested by his allowing a part of his essay on the Latitudinarians, "A Psychological Parallel," to be used as an introduction by W. M. Metcalfe in his edition of the discourses of John Smith, The Natural Truth of Christianity (Paisley, 1882).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A "Mather" of Dates by William R. Manierre</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1896 Kuno Francke published the "record" of what he calls "probably . . . the earliest expression of sustained interest, on the part of Americans, in German affairs"—a "chronological" listing of letters from Cotton Mather to August Hermann Francke and of entries from Mather's diary which mention Francke or his activities. 1 In this "record" is printed the following extract from Mather's diary: "1711. Nov. 10: I am again writing to ye University of Hall in ye Lower Saxony ; sending a present of Gold for ye Orphan-house there." After this entry there appears a portion of a letter, dated December 19, 1714, from A. H. Francke to Mather, which makes patent reference to both the proposed letter and gift mentioned by Mather in the passage just quoted. " Reverend Sir , It was the first of April, 1713, when I receiv'd your Letter, dated the 10 th of January 1712, in the West-Indies ; together with the Packet of Books, and the Piece of Gold accompanying them: But as for those you sent me the 28 th of May , 1711, (the Copy whereof I find also enclosed in the Packet just mentioned) they are not come to my Hands." To this entry Kuno Francke appends a footnote: "Since the year 1712 of Mather's diary is lost, our only information about this letter from Mather's side is the entry of Nov. 10, 1711." Inasmuch as this "lost" Mather diary has since been recovered, 2 there seems some use in pointing out that it says nothing whatever of the letter in question. Only one entry, that of December 17, concerns Mather's correspondence with the Pietist leader. 4. G.D. Among my other Ultramarine Services, I would again transmitt unto y e Lower Saxony , Such things as being translated into High Dutch, may Serve y e Kingdome of God, in those Countreyes; and Particularly Encourage Dr. Franckius &amp; his Orphan-house . Unfortunately, we cannot let the matter rest here. Mr. Francke's footnote, in suggesting that Mather's diary entry of January 10, 1712, might well have contained a comment on his letter of the same date, indirectly laments the loss of that comment. On closer inspection, however, one finds that what Francke's article dates as Mather's diary entry of November 10, 1711, is, in fact, the entry for January 10, 1711/12, 3 precisely the date mentioned by Mather's correspondent; so that what we have is the curious circumstance of a scholar's calling attention to the non-existence of a passage which, unrecognized by himself, he has just quoted. Curious this may be but it occurs not once but twice in the article under discussion. Again in a footnote, Mr. Francke remarks that, "it is strange that the [diary] entry of May 28, 1711, does not contain a mention of a letter of Mather's to Francke which is referred to in Francke's letter of Dec. 19, 1714, as bearing that date. This seems to have been the first communication sent by Mather to Francke." But already quoted in the article, under date of March 25, is this passage: "When I send unto Dr. Franckius in the lower Saxony , I would enclose a present of Gold, for his Orphan-house , which may be to the value of four or five pounds in that Country." But once again Kuno Francke has misdated a quotation by two months; and the passage, correctly dated "May 25," is, in spite of the negligible difference of three days, pretty obviously the very "mention" the "strange" absence of which his article points out. 4 The cause of all this confusion is, of course, Francke's unawareness that Mather, in accordance with "legal-year" practise, considered March, not January, to be the first month of the year. Accordingly, whenever Mather numbered the month instead of writing it out, Francke is two months off in his ascription. "2. d 8. m ," for instance, by which Mather meant the second day of the eighth month (October), becomes, in Francke's article, the second day of August and "10. d 1. m " becomes the tenth of January instead of March. 5 The result is that this pioneering study of the relations between the prominent Boston divine and the father of German Pietism is, so far as chronology is concerned, completely unreliable. Half of a total of twenty-four citations are misdated; all twelve by two months and three by varying numbers of days. On the left, below, are the twelve incorrect entries as recorded by Francke. 1709 . Mather's Diary "Dec. 9" . . . . . should be February 3, 1709/10. I do not know how Francke arrived at his "9". The manuscript diary reads, "3. d 12. m Friday." 1711 . Mather's Diary "Mar. 12-13" . . . . . should be May 16. Mather frequently went a week or more without entering a date. Each day of the week, however, was identified by a numbered "G. D." or "Good Devised," an intention to perform some benevolent action on the day of entry. Sunday was assigned number 1, and a new series began each week. Francke's difficulty here stems from his ignorance of this peculiarity of Mather's system. Mather's last dated entry reads, "12/13. d 3. m Satureday/Lords-Day"; i.e. the night of the 12th and morning of the 13th of May. Following this are four "G. D's," the fourth of which, representing Mather's pious intention for Wednesday, May 16, constitutes what Francke dates as "Mar. 12-13." "Mar. 25" . . . . . should be May 25. "Apr. 7" . . . . . should be June 27. I do not see how Francke arrived at his "7". Mather's last dated entry is "24. d 4. m Lords-Day" for Sunday, June 24. What Francke ascribes to April 7 is the third "G. D." following—or Mather's entry for June 27. "Nov. 10" . . . . . should be January 10, 1711/12. Mather's entry is the fourth "G. D." following the dated entry for January 6. Why, in this instance, Francke counted the "G. D.'s" correctly I cannot say. From this point on, Francke's dating of diary entries is correct, presumably because Mather altered his system by: 1) identifying month by name instead of number and 2) numbering his "G. D.'s" consecutively throughout each month instead of by week. Unfortunately, however, Mather continued to identify the dates of his letters by number rather than name of month. The result in Francke's article is that correctly dated diary entries alternate with incorrectly dated letters. Following are the incorrect ascripitons: 1715 . "Oct. 2. Letter from Mather to Boehme" 6 . . . . . should be December 2. 1716 "June 6. Letter from Mather to Boehme" . . . . . should be August 6. Here only does incorrect dating lead to error in the article's "chronological" order. The following entry (from Mather's diary) is correctly dated "Aug. 2." 1718 . "Jan. 10 . . . letter to Boehme . . ." should be March 10. "May 15 . . . letter to Boehme . . ." should be July 15. 1720 . "May 4 . . . letter to John Winthrop . . ." should be July 4. "May 8 . . . letter to Boehme . . ." should be July 8. "Oct. 26 . . . letter to John Winthrop . . ." should be Dec. 26.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Kuno Francke, "Cotton Mather and August Hermann Francke," Harvard Studies and Notes in Philology and Literature , V (1896), 57-67. 2 A fact of which Kuno Francke apparently remained unaware. In his "The Beginning of Cotton Mather's Correspondence with August Hermann Francke" ( PQ , V, [1926], 193), he refers to the earlier study without mentioning the recovery of the "lost" manuscript. Nor have I been successful in tracing the history of this now recovered document. Between 1816 and 1820 considerable portions of it were published in The Panoplist and Missionary Magazine (Vols. XII-XVI), but, by 1891 in his Cotton Mather : The Puritan Priest , Barrett Wendell could state explicitly that "the Diary of 1712 is not extant." On May 22, 1919, however, more than a quarter of a century after Wendell's assertion, and more than a century after its unnoticed publication in The Panoplist , the diary reappeared in New York as lot 213A at Scott-O'Shaugnessy sale number 64 where it was purchased by William Gwynn Mather of Cleveland. It has subsequently become part of the Mather collection of the Tracy W. McGregor Library at the University of Virginia. 3 Mather began each year's diary on his birthday, the twelfth of February. Consequently, the entry for January 10, 1711/12 was available to Francke in the manuscript diary of 1711, and is, of course, not to be found in the diary of 1712. 4 Volume II of Ford's edition of The Diary of Cotton Mather , with entries correctly dated, appeared in 1912, fourteen years prior to Francke's article in The Philological Quarterly . 5 When examining the manuscript diary for the entry of May 28, 1711, Francke must have looked up Mather's entry for July 28 ("28.d5.m"). Since the manuscript of 1712 was missing, he could not very well examine it for a January 10 entry; but if he had had the document, presumably he would have checked under "10. d 1. m " (March 10) instead of "10. d 11. m " (January 10) and, consequently, would again have come up empty-handed. 6 Anthony William Boehm (1673-1722), German chaplain at the Court of St. James by way of whom Mather sent most of his correspondence to A. H. Francke, was, according to Kuno Francke, "the chief promoter of German Pietism in England" (p. 58).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">An Unknown Early Appearance of "The Raven" by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There has been a great deal of discussion of the publishing history of "The Raven" and much controversy about its first appearance. But it has apparently not been noticed before that one of the early republications of "The Raven" was in the New York Weekly News for February 8, 1845. No two Poe bibliographers give the same list of appearances of "The Raven," but none lists this Weekly News reprint. In order to see its relative position, therefore, it may be of some value to construct a composite list based on the information supplied by previous bibliographies, principally four: Killis Campbell's notes to The Poems of Edgar Allan Poe (1917); John W. Robertson's Poe bibliography (1934); Charles F. Heartman and James R. Canny's Poe bibliography (1943); and Edward H. O'Neill's bibliographical notes to The Complete Poems and Stories of Edgar Allan Poe (1946). 1. New York Evening Mirror , January 29, 1845. 2. American Review , I, 143-145 (February 1845). 1 3. New York Tribune , February 4, 1845. 4. Broadway Journal , I, 90 (February 8, 1845). 5. New York Weekly Mirror , February 8, 1845. 6. New York Weekly News , February 8, 1845. 7. New York Weekly Tribune , February 8, 1845. 8. Howard District Press (Ellicotts, Md.), February 15, 1845. 2 9. Southern Literary Messenger , XI, 186-188 (March 1845). 10. London Critic , June 14, 1845. 11. Littell's Living Age , July 1845. 3 12. G. Vandenhoff, A Plain System of Elocution , 2nd ed., 1845. 4 13. The Raven and Other Poems , 1845. 14.

Philadelphia Saturday Courier , November 3, 1849. The Weekly News text is thus tied with three others for the position of fourth printing. It occupies the first column and part of the second column of the first page, and it is labeled as a reprint from the Evening Mirror . A collation of this text with Campbell's text and his variorum notes shows that it does follow the Evening Mirror text, except for three misprints (exclusive of alterations in punctuation): line 8 reads "it ghost" for "its ghost"; line 16 reads "'This" for "'Tis"; and line 45 reads "are" for "art." This faithful copying includes the erroneous repetition of "he" in line 59 (which occurs in both the Mirror printings). It also means, of course, that the eleventh stanza begins with "Startled at" rather than the "Wondering at" of the American Review and that the last three lines of the stanza follow the uncorrected American Review version. 7 The poem is introduced with the same note by Willis about "the following remarkable poem by Edgar Poe" that accompanied the poem frequently in its reprintings around the country. 8 The New York Weekly News: A Journal of Miscellaneous Intelligence, Literature, Agriculture, and Politics was edited by John L. O'Sullivan (1813-1895), who also edited the New York Morning News and the United States Magazine and Democratic Review (which published some of Poe's Marginalia and work by Hawthorne, Whitman, Whittier, Longfellow, and Lowell). 9 The Weekly News' republication of "The Raven" was not the only way in which Poe entered its columns during 1845. Two of Poe's stories were reprinted and the 1845 Tales reviewed there. 10 In addition, on March 22, 1845, Philip P. Cooke's "Florence Vane" (reprinted from the Broadway Journal ) is introduced with this comment: "We have had frequent requests within the last ten days, for a copy of 'Florence Vane'—a little poem merited [ sic ] by Mr. Poe, in his late Lecture on the Poetry of America." Two months later, on May 24, three long paragraphs entitled "Old English Poetry" are labeled " From a critique by Edgar A. Poe, in the Broadway Journal "; and on November 8 a review of Sarah Josepha Hale's Alice Ray is taken from "Mr. Poe's Broadway Journal ." The week after "The Raven" appeared the Weekly News points out (p. 2), in a review of the American Review for February 1845, that the "Poem of the Raven we have already laid before our readers." And the week just before its appearance (February 1, 1845) the Weekly News reviewer comments (p. 2) on Poe in a discussion of the current Graham's : Graham's Magazine for February is illustrated by a portrait of Edgar A. Poe, with an accompanying biography by Lowell. We cordially give a welcome to this distinct recognition of Mr. Poe's merits. Whenever his name is mentioned it has been with the comment that he is a remarkable man, a man of genius. Few knew precisely what he had written, his name was not on Library catalogues or any of his books on the shelves. His influence has been felt while the man was unknown. Lowell's article removes the anonymous and exhibits the author of some of the most peculiar and characteristic productions in our literature. Metaphysical acuteness of perception, resting on imagination, might be no unapt description of the powers developed in the creation of tales remarkable for touching the extreme of mystery and the most faithful literalness of daily life, and criticisms, profoundly constructed and original in the mind of the critic, and calling forth the same faculties as the production of the best books themselves. The New York Weekly News must now be added to the list of newspapers that play a part in the story of Poe's career.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 It has often been argued that the American Review printing was the first on the grounds that the February issue probably came out before the January 29 newspaper. Robertson, for example, believes that the American Review contained the first printing (II, 224) and lists eight republications through the Griswold publication of 1847 (I, 23). J. H. Whitty, in "First and Last Publication of Poe's Raven," Publishers' Weekly , CXXX (October 17, 1936), 1635, discusses the question and suggests that the American Review was first. Heartman and Canny say that the American Review text was undoubtedly the earlier and that the Evening Mirror version is revised, but they feel one cannot be sure which was available for sale first (p. 233); they list both as the original publication (p. 100). O'Neill follows this practice (II, 1070), while Campbell gives priority to the Evening Mirror (p. 246), as does David Randall in his review of Robertson's bibliography in Publishers' Weekly , CXXV (April 21, 1934), 1542. The matter is also discussed by Hervey Allen in Israfel (rev. ed., 1934), pp. 505-507, and by A. H. Quinn in his Edgar Allan Poe (1941), pp. 438-439. 2 The confusion in the listings is shown by the fact that items 7 and 8 are not listed by Campbell (1917), they are listed by Heartman and Canny (1943), and they are not listed by O'Neill (1946). 3 Listed by Heartman and Canny but not by O'Neill or by Campbell. 4 T. O. Mabbott announced in two articles that this volume, which was published by September 1845, contained the first book publication of "The Raven": "The First Publication of Poe's 'Raven,'" BNYPL , XLVII (August 1943), 581-584; Poe's 'Raven': First Inclusion in a Book," N &amp; Q , CLXXXV (October 9, 1943), 225. 5 Heartman and Canny, on p. 100, date the Emporium appearance February 1845, but this is an error (not listed on the errata sheet), for on p. 218 they give Poe's only appearance in the Emporium as December 1845, as do Campbell and O'Neill. 6 In Poe's essay "The Philosophy of Composition"; listed in the Riverside edition (ed. J. H. Whitty, 1911), p. 338, and in Campbell. 7 As well as in Campbell's notes, these variants are discussed in John D. Gordan, "Edgar Allan Poe: An Exhibition on the Centenary of His Death . . .," BNYPL , LIII (October 1949), 471-491. 8 This note originated in the Mirror , but the January 29 printing of the poem labels it "by Quarles." The February 8 paragraph in the Mirror , identical with the one in the Weekly News , is reproduced in Allen, p. 503. On p. 507, however, Allen is somewhat misleading in his comment on the Howard District Press , for a reader could easily infer from his remark that this newspaper first revealed Poe as author or at least first reprinted the introductory paragraph. But it appeared in the Weekly News a week earlier than in the Howard District Press . 9 The Weekly News began publication on September 7, 1844, and by the following August 23 it was advertised as "already the second in point of circulation of the weekly papers published in the city of New York, not taking the exclusively religious journals into the count. It is so generally known, that any comment upon its merits is not necessary." For further information about O'Sullivan (mainly in his connection with the Democratic Review ), see Frank Luther Mott, History of American Magazines 1741-1850 (1930), pp. 677-684. 10 "The Purloined Letter" was reprinted on January 25, 1845, and "The Oval Portrait" on May 10; the Tales was reviewed on July 5.

      <field name="heading_text">Evidence of Plate Damage as Applied to the First Impressions of Ellen Glasgow's The Wheel of Life (1906) by Oliver L. Steele</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Plate damage is one of the most useful kinds of evidence available to bibliographers for distinguishing the impressions of modern books. 1 However, as this note will suggest, such evidence is potentially treacherous and must often be correlated with another kind of evidence if it is to be used correctly. Secondarily, but perhaps more valuably, this note will suggest a tentative solution to the problem of imposition in modern books, a problem which bibliographers have had little success in solving. 2 It should be remembered that the solution offered here is, as stated, tentative and needs further and more rigorous testing. In a sample of 150 copies of what, for the present, will be called the first impression of The Wheel of Life , all have in common the misspelling "forefeiture" in line 17 of page 449. 3 Present in all copies is an extraordinary amount of plate damage, the most significant of which is listed below: Inner forme, 6th gathering (beginning p. 75), p. 84, last line (so sincere). Outer forme, 6th gathering, p. 86, running title. Inner forme, 28th gathering (beginning p. 427), p. 432, last line (to). Outer forme, 28th gathering, p. 434, last line (humiliated). Inner forme, 29th gathering (beginning p. 443), p. 444, last line (meant). Outer forme, 29th gathering, p. 446, last line (ideal). 4 Damage to these three gatherings is distributed throughout the 150 copies in the following patterns: 5 84 86 432 434 444 446 1. Vassar C X 2. British Museum X 3. Iowa State U X X X 4. Purdue U X X X 5. Howard C X X X 6. Smith C X X X 7. Wyoming U X X X 8. Minnesota U X X X 9. Georgetown U X X X 10. Oberlin C X X X X 11. Wisconsin U X X X X 12. Fresno P L X X X X 13. San Diego P L X X X X 14. Virginia U X X X X 15. Boston U X X X X 16. Pittsburgh U X X X X 17. Howard U X X X X 18. Birmingham P L X X X X 19. Toronto U X X X X X 20. Georgia U X X X X X 21. Swarthmore C X X X X X 22. Arizona U X X X X X 23. Princton U X X X X X 24. Wellesley C 6 X X X X X X Although there is a perceptible progression of damage from the Vassar copy to the Wellesley copy, apparently there was some mixing of early and late states or impressions of gatherings within copies. But the makeup of various copies is best approached by analyzing the printing of the sheets of the book, and since the kind of damage found in gathering 6 is characteristic of all three gatherings, the analysis will be centered there. One might hypothesize three possible ways of printing gathering 6: 1) simultaneous impressions from two sets of plates, 7 2) different impressions from one set of plates, 3) a single impression from one set of plates. Of these, only the third is at all probable. The second can be ruled out immediately. For if a first impression produced the damage to page 84 found in the Vassar, Boston University, and University of Toronto copies; then any subsequent impression would of necessity also produce it, and such copies as the British Museum and University of Georgia copies could not possibly result. The first possibility is also untenable. For if one set of plates produced the damage to page 84 found in the Vassar copy and another set the damage to page 86 found in the British Museum copy, then such copies as the Wellesley copy could only have been the result either of plate damage which developed in both sets of plates at exactly the same places, or of a third impression printed from formes made up of the damaged page plates of both sets. Neither of these explanations, depending so heavily on unlikely coincidence, is convincing. The 150 copies listed, then, contain gathering 6 in only one impression. Furthermore, the damage found there must be in-press damage, plate damage which develops during printing rather than between impressions; for the supposition that some of the damage occurred to the type before casting the plates or to the plates before printing can be rejected on the same grounds as different impressions from one set of plates. The fact that all of the damage considered in this note is, like that of gathering 6, in-press damage casts some doubt upon the use of this kind of evidence as a means of distinguishing separate impressions of modern books. The damage found reflected in these gatherings occurs at the top, bottom, and side edges of pages, just where page plates are most likely to be damaged during storage between impressions. For that reason, given several copies like the Iowa State copy and several more like the Wellesley copy, one might have distinguished two impressions of the novel without misgivings. The only cure for this problem, in the absence of other evidence, is a reasonably large sampling of impressions and, often, a close analysis of damaged gatherings in an attempt to relate the damage to possible methods of printing. With the fact established that all 150 copies of gathering 6 are of the same impression, one can reconstruct with near certainty the method by which the impression sheet was imposed. The reconstruction requires only the assumption that the 150 copies examined are an adequate sampling of the impression sheet. 8 In an impression, say, of 3,000 copies, the ratio of damage variants in gathering 6 would be: 63 copies damaged on p. 84 only 1,260 copies 44 copies damaged on p. 86 only 880 copies 43 copies damaged on pp. 84 &amp; 86 860 copies Two methods of imposition could have produced the required variants in the correct ratio. The less likely method, printing the white paper with two inner formes imposed together (gatherings 5 and 6) and perfecting with the two complementary outer formes, would result in 1. 880 sheets printed without damage 2. 2,120 sheets printed with damage to p. 84 2. a. 1,250 sheets perfected with damage to p. 84 b. 860 sheets perfected with damage to pp. 84 and 86 1. 880 sheets perfected with damage to p. 86 or 3,000 copies of gathering 6. Clearly this method could produce the ratio and variants of the sample, but it could do so only if the order of perfecting outlined above were followed exactly. The introduction of an undamaged inner into the press before page plate 86 had become battered during perfecting would have produced an undamaged sheet. Further, this explanation would require that, in the printing stage, the sheets were delivered to the table printed-side-down; for if they had been delivered printed-side-up, then the undamaged inners would have been the first sheets perfected and undamaged sheets would have resulted. 9 It is much more likely that another method of imposition — work-and-turn of the inner and outer formes of the gathering — was used. In this method the white paper is printed with the inner and outer formes of the same gathering imposed together; the sheets are then flipped over the short axis and perfected by the same inner and outer formes. Each sheet, when cut, produces two identical half-sheets. This is the more probable method because it requires no definite order of perfecting to have produced the variants and ratio of the sample and it could not produce an undamaged gathering: 63 copies 1,260 half-sheets 630 sheets 44 copies 880 half-sheets 440 sheets 43 copies 860 half-sheets 430 sheets 1. 880 sheets printed undamaged 2. 380 sheets printed damaged to p. 84 3. 240 sheets printed damaged to pp. 84 and 86 1. perfected 880 half-sheets (gatherings) with p. 84 damaged and 880 half-sheets with p. 86 damaged 2. perfected 380 half-sheets with pp. 84 and 86 damaged and 380 halfsheets with p. 84 damaged 3. perfected 480 half-sheets with pp. 84 and 86 damaged or 3,000 copies of gathering 6. Because plate damage developed during printing (rather than during perfecting), the order of perfecting is of no importance since any order would have produced the same variants and ratio. 10 That all of the damage did occur during printing, assuming that the ratio of damaged states (63/44/43) in the sample is correct for the impression, can be demonstrated by testing the idea that the damage to page 84 (or to page 86) occurred instead during perfecting. Had that been the case it would have taken 860 full sheets to produce the gatherings with damage to both pages 84 and 86, and 1,260 full sheets to produce the gatherings with damage to page 84 alone. But this is a total of 2,120 sheets — over 600 too many. Furthermore, the ratio of gatherings would have been 63/212/43. 11 If the sample used is an adequate reflection of the impression, then gathering 6 was printed by the work-and-turn method and damage occurred before perfecting. This conclusion, however, appears to be contradicted by the evidence of gatherings 28 and 29. For if the work-and-turn method does not produce undamaged gatherings when damage occurs during printing, then there seems to be no explanation for the Vassar and British Museum copies. One might return for explanation to the theory of printing with two outers and perfecting with two inners. However, disregarding the inherent objections to this method, an analysis of the printing of gathering 28 by this method will show that such an explanation is an unlikely one: 6 copies with no damage 120 sheets 40 copies with damage to p. 432 800 sheets 29 copies with damage to p. 434 580 sheets 75 copies with damage to pp. 432 and 434 1,500 sheets The following order of printing the sheets, or one similar to it, is necessary to produce the variety and number of copies found in the sample: 1. 600 sheets printed without damage to p. 432 2. 2,300 sheets printed with damage to p. 432 1. a. 120 undamaged sheets perfected without damage to p. 434 2. a. 800 sheets with p. 432 damaged perfected without damage to p. 434 1. b. 580 undamaged sheets perfected with damage to p. 434 2. b. 1,500 sheets with p. 432 damaged perfected with damage to p. 434 also or 3,000 sheets. Although this method will explain the states of gathering 28 found in the sample, the circumstances which would have led to such a peculiar sequence of damaged and undamaged sheets during perfecting are hard to imagine. If this method of printing may be rejected as unlikely, the only alternative is to suppose that two impressions of gathering 28 (and gathering 29) are represented in the sample. The first impression is represented by copies like the Vassar and British Museum copies and the second by all those copies which show some damage in gathering 28. That this is the correct explanation of the states of gatherings 28 and 29 is strongly supported by some striking physical differences between copies which contain these gatherings in an undamaged state and all other copies presumably. 12 All of the former are cut and trimmed, with a uniform page length of 19.2 cm; all of the latter which I have seen or had report of are partially uncut and untrimmed and have page lengths varying within copies from 19.7 cm to 20.3 cm. The difficulty with this explanation is to account for the small number of copies containing the first impression of gatherings 28 and 29. This problem is perhaps best resolved by supposing that these copies were advance copies made up for reviewers. A possible explanation is that the printer began printing the gatherings by work-and-turn, 3,000 at a time, and that as the publication date approached, he decided to interrupt this process in order to print a limited number of the later gatherings of the book to make up advance copies. 13 Thus all copies of what has been called the first impression of The Wheel of Life contain the first six gatherings, at least, in the first impression. Copies like the Vassar and British Museum copies contain the last three gatherings, at least, in the first impression also; and all other copies contain the last three gatherings in a second impression. Finally, since the second impression of gatherings 28 and 29 shows all the characteristic damage of gathering 6, the analysis made of the printing and imposition of gathering 6 is applicable to them as well. At this point, it might be valuable to state some of the implications of this analysis. The most important of these is that it is possible to use plate damage to determine the method of imposition in modern books if certain conditions obtain: 1) damage must be present in both inner and outer formes of gatherings, 2) the sample on which analysis is based must be random and large enough to reflect a statistically sound ratio of damaged states within the impression. 14 The problem is obviously one of determining the size of the sample needed to give a statistically sound ratio. If the size of the impression can be found out, then the size of the necessary sample can be determined by conventional statistical methods. When, as in the case of The Wheel of Life , records are not available, a guess has to serve, and conclusions must, consequently, be tentative. 15 So far, primarily for clarity, the assumption has been that the gatherings of The Wheel of Life were printed from both the inner and outer formes of a single gathering laid on the press together. That is, the bed of the press contained sixteen page plates. However, this assumption needs further testing. The cylinder presses of the time could certainly print thirty-two and even sixty-four standard novel-size pages at once, and it is a reasonable assumption that any shop which had such a press would have taken the obvious economic advantage of printing the larger sheet. Here too the evidence from damaged plates may explain the number of plates imposed together and their arrangement. In the normal operation of a cylinder press, the edge of the type which bears the initial impact of the cylinder as it rolls over the bed of the press receives more stress and is, thus, more likely to be damaged than any other area of type. This edge is called the leading edge. After the leading edge the opposite (following) edge of the type receives most stress, and the side edges somewhat less. The type inside the four edges of a forme receives little stress and, barring accidents, is not likely to be damaged during printing. 16 In the following analysis of the damage in gatherings 28 and 29, it will be assumed that plates were damaged in the normal course of printing and that, therefore, the damage occurred at one of the vulnerable edges of the forme. The problem will be to associate the observed damage with one of the known methods of work-and-turn imposition so that it lies on one or more of those edges. If the pages of gathering 28 are fitted into the usual scheme of imposition for work-and-turn of a single octavo gathering, the damage to the bottoms of pages 432 and 434 will appear internally within the edges of the forme. And if the same is done to the pages of gathering 29, the damage to pages 444 and 446 will appear on the side edges of the forme. 17 By reversing the positions of the inner and outer formes of gathering 28, the damage to pages 432 and 434 can be made to appear on the side edges also; but, of course, if the formes of gathering 29 are similarly reversed, the damage to pages 444 and 446 will appear inside the edges. If the assumption that the damage to the two gatherings occurred in the normal course of printing, and thus on the edges of the formes, is correct; then it is most doubtful that these gatherings were printed from the inner and outer formes of a single gathering imposed together. For to say that the damage to both gatherings occurred at the edges of the formes is to argue, in this case, that one gathering was imposed in a scheme different from the other. It is unbelievable that a printer would vary his imposition scheme from gathering to gathering. 18 If the sixteen page plates of a single gathering were not imposed together in printing The Wheel of Life , it must be the case that the plates of two or more gatherings were imposed together. Again if the assumption about the location of plate damage is correct, the same objections which have been made to imposition of sixteen page plates in two octavo formes may be made to the imposition of sixty-four page plates in eight octavo formes to print four gatherings. 19 For in such a scheme the damage to gathering 28 would still appear inside the edges of the formes, and no arrangement, short of the kind argued against in regard to the sixteen page imposition, could bring it out to one or more of the edges. DeVinne illustrates only one scheme of imposition for thirty-two pages containing the four formes of two octavo gatherings. 20 But this scheme explains the damage in gatherings 28 and 29 and, at the same time, allows the assumption that the damage occurred at the edges of the type in the normal course of printing. In this scheme, the damage at pages 444 and 446 of gathering 29 and at pages 432 and 434 of gathering 28, all, appears either on the leading or the following edge — at those places where damage is most likely to occur during printing. I conclude, therefore, that this was the scheme used to print The Wheel of Life . 21</field>

Of the 150 copies, I have examined twenty; the rest were examined by private persons and staff members of various libraries. A random followup check was made of forty of the copies not seen by me to determine the accuracy of reporting. I wish to thank the librarians and scholars who examined copies for me. 4 Other pages damaged in some copies are 17, 21, 96, 419, 438, 451; all of this damage occurs on the margins of pages. 5 The following abbreviations are used in this table: C — College, U — University, P L — Public Library. 6 The twenty-four patterns are represented by the following numbers: 1-5, 2-1, 3-9, 4-7, 5-5, 6-9, 7-8, 8-3, 9-12, 10-5, 11-5, 12-3, 13-1, 14-1, 15-1, 16-1, 17-2, 18-2, 19-25, 20-6, 21-2, 22-3, 23-4, 24-30. 7 Or, much less likely, separate impressions from type and plates. 8 In assuming that these 150 copies are an accurate reflection of the impression of 3,000 copies, one also assumes 1) that there are no copies undamaged in both formes of gathering 6, and 2) that the ratio of damaged states of gathering 6 found in the sample can be applied to the whole impression sheet. By accurate reflection of the impression is meant a statistically sound sample, one which will give narrow confidence limits. The 1% sample in general use by bibliographers of hand-printed books is not statistically sound for the application described in this note. For it is important here not only to have all the states of the gathering represented in the sample, but also to have them represented in a ratio which closely approximates the ratio of states in the whole impression. I am indebted to Professor Marvin Tummins of the McIntire School of Commerce of the University of Virginia for his help with the statistical problem. 9 Theodore Low De Vinne points out that there are inherent objections to this method of imposition (sheetwise imposition). "One of the difficulties of sheetwise imposition is that of making register when there is shrinkage of furniture in either form . . . as a rule, the form that can be printed perfect on itself as a half-sheet is printed with more ease than if the pages were imposed in two forms." ( Book Composition , ed. J. W. Bothwell, 1918, pp. 154-155). 10 In the foregoing table, the numbered steps of the perfecting do not represent any necessary order of perfecting. That is, all three steps are interchangeable given the order of printing of the white sheets. 11 Supposing the damage to p. 84 occurred with the perfecting of the sheets, one would also have to suppose the order of printing and perfecting of the following table: 1. 1,260 full sheets printed without damage 2. 860 sheets printed with damage to p. 86 1. 1,260 half-sheets perfected with damage to p. 86 and 1,260 half-sheets perfected with damage to p. 84 2. 860 half-sheets perfected with damage to pp. 84 and 86 and 860 half-sheets perfected with damage to p. 86 12 It seems significant that both of the Library of Congress deposit copies have gatherings 28 and 29 in the undamaged state. Copy A is rebound, but Copy B is in the original binding and is cut and trimmed. 13 This explanation, or one something similar to it, seems the most likely to me. One would naturally be more satisfied with an explanation less conjectural. 14 See note 8. 15 Miss Helen Crosby of Doubleday &amp; Co., Inc. informs me that Doubleday no longer has records for 1906. 16 Thus damage to tops of pages, such as on p. 451 in gathering 29, is unlikely to be the result of normal pressure of the cylinder since the tops will normally lie inside the edges of the forme. The conclusion might be drawn that damage to tops of pages is a safer indication of separate impressions than damage to bottoms. 17 See "Half-Sheet Imposition in 19th and 20th Century Books," forthcoming in Gutenberg Jahrbuch , 1962. 18 The objections raised to the usual method of half-sheet imposition of an octavo gathering apply as well to variations known to me. See the schemes discussed by De Vinne, Modern Methods of Book Composition , (1904), p. 353. 19 See De Vinne, Modern Methods , p. 341. 20 Modern Methods , pp. 358-359. 21 One interesting question which has not yet been answered is whether gatherings 28 and 29 were imposed together. The Wheel of Life contains thirty gatherings and, if the formes of two gatherings were imposed together beginning with gatherings 1 and 2, gathering 28 would have been imposed with gathering 27 and gathering 29 with gathering 30. Furthermore, the pattern of damage in gatherings 28 and 29 offers some support to the belief that they were not imposed together. If, in the scheme illustrated above, the pages of gathering 27 are substituted for those of gathering 29, and the entire forme turned 180°, it can be seen that the damage to gathering 28 occupies exactly the same position as the damage in gathering 29 on the leading edge of the forme. The argument here is that ordinarily the bottoms of the pages of the earliest gathering of the two in the forme were at the leading edge, but that in the case of the forme containing gatherings 27 and 28, the forme was placed on the press upside down so that the pages of gathering 28 occupied the leading edge. This argument is strongly supported by the ratio of damage in the inner and outer formes within the two gatherings. In gathering 29, page 446 (outer) is damaged in 115 copies and page 444 (inner) in 102 copies. In gathering 28, page 434 (outer) is damaged in 104 copies and page 432 (inner) in 115 copies. If, as argued, the forme containing gathering 28 was turned 180° it is easy to see why 432 is damaged in exactly the same number of copies as page 446 and page 434 in almost the same number as page 444. The same amount of stress was placed at the same points on the leading edge of the forme. I wish to thank Mr. John Cook Wyllie and Professor Bowers for their advice, and Mr. Willis Shell of the William Byrd Press of Richmond and Matthew Bruccoli for critical readings in an early stage.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">West's Revisions of Miss Lonelyhearts by Carter A. Daniel</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before Nathanael West's Miss Lonelyhearts was published in April, 1933, early versions of five chapters had appeared separately in periodicals. 1 A comparison of these early chapters with the versions in the book shows that West made revisions of varying significance on all levels, some throwing light on the basic conception and meaning of the book, and some revealing no more than West's personal preferences in diction and phrasing. An analysis of the revisions is highly rewarding because it helps to clarify the author's aims, some features of his thought, and the technical means by which he solved certain problems of style and structure. The first of the early chapters (February, 1932) gave "Miss Lonelyhearts" a real name too—Thomas Matlock—but this was an idea which, for good reasons, West soon discarded. The use of a real name eliminates the omnipresent irony of such sentences as "While they held the lamb, Miss Lonelyhearts crouched over it and began to chant" (p. 23), 2 "Miss Lonelyhearts stood at the bar, swaying slightly to the remembered music" (p. 37), or "Miss Lonelyhearts lay on his bed fully dressed, just as he had been dumped the night before" (p. 43). The jolting incongruity in the opening sentence of the final version was totally lacking in the lifeless original: February, 1932 Thomas Matlock, the Miss Lonely- hearts of the New York Evening Hawk (Are you in trouble? Do you need advice? Write to Miss Lonelyhearts and she will help you), decided to walk from the Hawk Building across the park to Delehanty's speakeasy. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Lamb," p. 80) April, 1933 The Miss Lonelyhearts of The New York Post-Dispatch (Are-you-in-trou- ble? — Do-you-need-advice?—Write-to -Miss-Lonely hearts-and-she-will-help -you) sat at his desk and stared at a piece of white cardboard. (p. 1) Apparently dissatisfied with the weaknesses incurred by giving Miss Lonelyhearts a name, West tried in May, 1932, another idea, a first person narration. With this technique he could easily maintain his columnist's anonymity and eliminate the disadvantages of the former method. But now further problems arose from the absence of an external voice which could tell Miss Lonelyhearts' adventures with the appearance of objectivity. The sardonically matter-of-fact, seemingly objective narration is a valuable stylistic asset, since to maintain the continual element of surprise there must be only limited insight into Miss Lonelyhearts' thoughts. When, for example, as early as the fourth chapter, Miss Lonelyhearts suddenly plunges his hand into Betty's dress and feels the nipple of her breast, the reader is sure to be shocked, or at least surprised; but if Miss Lonelyhearts had been telling his own story up to this point, West would unavoidably have revealed so much of the man's character that the episode would even have seemed quite natural. Moreover, this point of view would have precluded the ending which West used, wherein Miss Lonelyhearts is shot to death. But even apart from the ending, first person narration would be largely unsuitable in a novel which derives most of its impact from the author's implied ironical judgments of the main character. To use a first person narration and yet preserve the irony, West would have had to portray Miss Lonelyhearts as consciously self-critical, which he clearly is not: though reader and author can plainly see his confusion and incompetence, Miss Lonelyhearts takes himself very seriously, and any change in this view of himself would have affected the whole general meaning of the book. Finally, the early chapter constantly strains one's credulity simply because a cooly detached first-person account of so crucial and emotional an experience as Miss Lonelyhearts' seems implausible dramatically: May, 1932 Backing away from the bar, I col- lided with a man holding a glass of whiskey. I turned to beg his pardon and received a blow in the mouth. Later I found myself at a table in the backroom, playing with a loose tooth. I wondered why my hat didn't fit, and discovered a lump on the back of my head. I must have fallen. The hurdle was higher than I had thought. My anger swung in large drunken circles. . . . ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," p. 24) April, 1933 He stepped away from the bar and accidentally collided with a man hold- ing a glass of beer. When he turned to beg the man's pardon, he received a punch in the mouth. Later he found himself at a table in the back room, playing with a loose tooth. He won- dered why his hat did not fit and discovered a lump on the back of his head. He must have fallen. The hurdle was higher than he had thought. His anger swung in large drunken circles. . . . (pp. 37-38) After May, 1932, there were no major revisions in the conception of Miss Lonelyhearts , but there were still many changes made on a lesser scale. In the chapter published in July, 1932, for example, West experimented with a sort of interior monologue. Instead of having the feature editor Shrike as antagonist in "Miss Lonelyhearts in the Dismal Swamp," a voice in Miss Lonelyhearts' own mind assumes the role. The technique is inconsistent with that of the rest of the book, of course, and it seems very doubtful that Miss Lonelyhearts himself would have had these thoughts. Furthermore, by reapportioning this role to Shrike, West has made him the spokesman for the antagonistic point of view throughout the entire book. 3 There are also many other revisions which give the work unity and continuity. Each chapter in the novel is a single unit which deals with one incident, whereas some of the previously published chapters were more diffuse. In the earlier version of "Miss Lonelyhearts and the Lamb" the first eight paragraphs told of his preparing to go to Delehanty's, but in the ninth paragraph "He decided against Delehanty's and started home"; in the revision the whole first section was transferred to "Miss Lonelyhearts and the Dead Pan," in which he actually did go to the speakeasy, and thus the dramatic irrelevancy was eliminated. In the original "Miss Lonelyhearts and the Dead Pan" ten of the first twelve paragraphs were devoted to the long letter from Broad-Shoulders; in the revision, this letter is given a chapter to itself ("Miss Lonelyhearts Returns"), leaving the "Dead Pan" chapter to tell solely of the episodes surrounding the evening at Delehanty's. And the original "Miss Lonelyhearts and the Dead Pan" had a serious flaw in its geography: before reading Broad-Shoulders' letter, Miss Lonelyhearts had been in his office; afterwards, without explanation, he was shown in his room; and then he decided to go to Delehanty's. The revised chapter shows him going from his office to the speakeasy and therefore has geographical unity as well as the continuity of plot mentioned above. Finally, the revised "Miss Lonelyhearts in the Dismal Swamp" adds thirty paragraphs, a detailed account of Miss Lonelyhearts' three-day sickness and depression, onto the beginning of the earlier version to provide badly-needed transition between the preceding chapter's account of the Mrs. Doyle incident (which presumably was part of the cause of the depression) and the immediately following heckling by Shrike. Thus three of the five early chapters were altered structurally for the sake of unity. Many of the revisions helped to make the work unified by providing smooth transitions between chapters or paragraphs or sentences. The original "Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man" began bluntly with a new episode, whereas the revised version provides an introductory paragraph to link this chapter with the preceding one, in which Miss Lonelyhearts had been spurned by his fiancee: May, 1932 I went around to Delehanty's for a drink. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," p. 22) April, 1933 In the street again, Miss Lonely- hearts wondered what to do next. He was too excited to eat and afraid to go home. He felt as though his heart were a bomb, a complicated bomb that would result in a simple explo- sion, wrecking the world without rock- ing it. He decided to go to Delehanty's for a drink. (p. 33) Revision for smoother transition between paragraphs occurred very frequently. During one of Miss Lonelyhearts' dreams the scene changes from a theater to a college dormitory, but in only the revised version is the change accomplished smoothly: February, 1932 He was back in his college dormi- tory with Steve Garvey and Jud Hume. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Lamb," p. 84) April, 1933 The scene of the dream changed. He found himself in his college dormi tory. With him were Steve Garvey and Jud Hume. (pp. 21-22) Earlier, in a scene at Delehanty's, Miss Farkis comes in and expresses her interest in the the conversation on religion. Shrike's reaction, originally too sudden either for narrative continuity or for consistency in the characterization of the cynically calculating, advantage-seeking feature writer, was carefully anticipated in the revision: May, 1932 "Get me a drink, and please con- tinue. I'm very much interested in the new thomistic synthesis." "St. Thomas!" Shrike shouted . . . ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Dead Pan," p. 20) April, 1933 "Get me a drink and please con- tinue. I'm very much interested in the new thomistic synthesis." This was just the kind of remark for which Shrike was waiting. "St. Thomas!" he shouted. (p. 14) After leaving Delehanty's on another occasion, Miss Lonelyhearts and Ned Gates find a "clean old man" in the comfort station of a park; they take him to a bar, but not to Delehanty's. One additional word in the revised version makes the narrative more coherent: May, 1932 Instead of going to Delehanty's . . . ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," p. 25) April, 1933 Instead of going back to Delehanty's . . . (p. 40) Many passages were revised to make the transition smooth from sentence to sentence. Generally, the revisions provide information which was absent in the earlier version and thereby bridge gaps in the logical order of narration. In Miss Lonelyhearts' dream which was mentioned above, the first image features him on a public platform; the revision adds a sentence to explain how the prayer is connected with the rest of the scene: February, 1932 . . . he found himself before a micro- phone on the platform of a crowded auditorium. . . . No matter how he struggled his prayer was Shrike's pray- er and his voice was the voice of a conductor calling stations. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Lamb," p. 83) April, 1933 . . . he found himself on the stage of a crowded theater. . . . After his act was finished, he tried to lead his audience in prayer. But no matter how hard he struggled, his prayer was one Shrike had taught him and his voice was that of a conductor calling stations. (p. 21) When he and two of his college classmates see lambs for sale in the farmers' market, they immediately begin planning an exotic adventure; the revision clarifies the previously confused pronouns and provides transition between Jud's idea and Miss Lonelyhearts': February, 1932 Jud Hume suggested that they buy one and roast it over a fire in the woods. But it was his idea that they should sacrifice it to God before bar- becueing it. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Lamb," p. 84) April, 1933 Jud suggested buying one to roast over a fire in the woods. Miss Lonely- hearts agreed, but on the condition that they sacrifice it to God before barbecuing it. (p. 22) When the ideal of idyllic rural life is proposed as one possible escape from Miss Lonelyhearts' present unresolvable conflict, the revised version furnishes transition between the two contrasted ideas: July, 1932 . . . the bus takes too long while the subway is crowded so you walk behind the enormous millstones of your horse's moist behind . . . ("Miss Lonelyhearts in the Dismal Swamp," p. 2) April, 1933 The bus takes too long, while the subway is always crowded. So what do you do? So you buy a farm and walk behind your horse's moist be- hind . . . (p. 78) Just before Miss Lonelyhearts begins his day dream in Delehanty's, the alcohol takes effect and makes him receptive to this kind of reverie; the revised version makes the cause-and-effect relationship clear: May, 1932 I felt warm and sure. Through the light blue tobacco smoke the maho- gany bar shone like wet gold. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," pp. 23-24) April, 1933 The whisky was good and he felt warm and sure. Through the light- blue tobacco smoke, the mahogany bar shone like wet gold. (p. 37) Still another kind of unity is achieved through the removal of irrelevant details and undeveloped themes. Economy and clarity seem to have been West's primary aims in these revisions. He strove to eliminate all but the essential words, symbols, and themes, so that the novel might achieve power through its compactness and its clearness of focus. In the description of Miss Lonelyhearts' room, for example, the revision eliminates an item which does not figure in the story at all and which might mislead the reader and leave him unsatisfied if it were retained: February, 1932 The walls were bare except for a mirror and an ivory Christ. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Lamb," p. 82) April, 1933 The walls were bare except for an ivory Christ that hung opposite the foot of the bed. (p. 19) The description of Hedonism as an alternative to his present way of life was originally an odd paragraph parodying a literary style full of cliches; since this satire interfered with and almost destroyed the meaning of the paragraph, and since it was entirely inconsistent with the other chapters, the revision subordinated it so that now it seems to suggest the triteness of this kind of life: July, 1932 . . . you make a speech it's in the bag from the start ere the echoes of the starting gun die away headlong for the tape we plunge in the red with too big a nut yet play up play the game although flies in the milk as well as the amber we know full well but seeing as it's better to lie down with a full dog than a dead lion even if the cards are cold marked for em- phasis by the hand of fate and you are in a club that won't stand squawks where they deal only one hand and you must sit in so get a run for your money tank up grab what's on the buffet and use the girls in the upstairs rooms but when you throw box cars take it with a dead pan. ("Miss Lonelyhearts in the Dismal Swamp," p. 2) April, 1933 . . . you get to your feet and call for silence in order to explain your phil- osophy of life. "Life," you say, "is a club where they won't stand for squawks, where they deal you only one hand and you must sit in. So even if the cards are cold and marked by the hand of fate, play up, play up like a gentleman and a sport. Get tanked, grab what's on the buffet, use the girls upstairs, but remember, when you throw box cars, take the curtain like a dead game sport, don't squawk." (p. 81) In the passage in which the cynics at Delehanty's tell of the female novelist who started to write a book about "a lot of mugs in a speak," the revision eliminates the anticlimactic and irrelevant ending: May, 1932 Well, the mugs didn't know they were picturesque and thought she was reg- ular until the bartender put them wise. They got her into the back room to teach her a new word and put the boots to her. They didn't let her out for three days. On the third day they sold tickets to niggers. But here's the pay off—she finished the novel. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," p. 22) April, 1933 Well, the mugs didn't know they were picturesque and thought she was reg- ular until the barkeep put them wise. They got her into the back room to teach her a new word and put the boots to her. They didn't let her out for three days. On the last day they sold tickets to niggers. (p. 34) And in the earlier version of this same chapter one of the cynics asked, "What matter if his daily column does not always subscribe to grammar's nice autocracy?" ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," p. 23). The revised version eliminates this paragraph, since the question of grammar is one which is entirely irrelevant to the theme of the novel. These and other similar revisions help Miss Lonelyhearts to achieve its intense focus on the young man's obsessive dilemma. Most of the revisions which West made during the year before he completed his novel were of the kind usually associated with proofreading, but they are at least as significant as the changes in conception and structure, by virtue of their contribution to the novel's consciseness. He was clearly a careful and thoughtful proofreader, for nearly every change is indisputably an improvement, and some of the most trenchant parts of the novel are the results of these revisions. Economy was the sole object of some, and of course the impact of the whole novel is partly attributable to its laconic precision. The aim of revisions which simplified the syntax, for example, is in perfect accord with the simple, matter-of-fact tone of the narration: February, 1932 . . . like a spear it pierced him through. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Lamb," p. 80) April, 1933 It pierced him like a spear. (p. 9) Matlock had given the readers of his column many stones. . . . ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Lamb," p. 81) He had given his readers many stones . . . (p. 10) Sometimes the revision created a more definite image where the earlier version had been primarily simply a narration of events: October, 1932 When he arrived at the obelisk, he sat down on a bench to wait for Mrs. Doyle. ("Miss Lonelyhearts on a Field Trip," p. 53) April, 1933 He sat down on a bench near the obelisk to wait for Mrs. Doyle. 4 (p. 64) Another simple kind of revision was the elimination of repetition. West was careful to avoid this natural tendency wherever possible: February, 1932 The decay covering its surface was not the decay in which life generates. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Lamb," p. 80) April, 1933 The decay that covered the surface of the mottled ground was not the kind in which life generates. (p. 9) Teach them to pray for their daily stone: Give us this day our daily stone. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Lamb," p. 81) Teach them to pray each morning: "Give us this day our daily stone." (p. 10) No matter how he struggled his prayer was Shrike's prayer and his voice was the voice of a conductor calling sta- tions. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Lamb," p. 83) But no matter how hard he struggled, his prayer was one Shrike had taught him and his voice was that of a con- ductor calling stations. (p. 21) Similar is the elimination of awkward passages and phrases to give greater coherence and make the work more pictorial, another type of revision which shows West's careful attention to wording. The following change eliminated ambiguity by clarifying the pronoun's antecedent: February, 1932 Because of its terrible struggles his next stroke went wrong . . . ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Lamb," p. 84) April, 1933 He raised the knife again and this time the lamb's violent struggles made him miss altogether. (p. 23) The following revision reflects syntactically the logical sequence of cause and effect: May, 1932 I felt as I had felt years before when I had accidentally stepped on a frog. Its spilled guts filled me with pity, but my pity turned to rage when its suf- fering became real to my senses, and I beat it frantically until it was dead. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," p. 26) April, 1933 Miss Lonelyhearts felt as he had felt years before, when he had accidentally stepped on a small frog. Its spilled guts had filled him with pity, but when its suffering had become real to his senses, his pity had turned to rage and he had beaten it frantically until it was dead. (p. 41) In the earlier versions there were a few references too cryptic to be plainly understood. The revisions consisted of rewording or of providing additional information: May, 1932 At college, and perhaps for a year afterwards, they had believed in litera- ture, had believed in personal expres- sion as a literary end. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," p. 22) April, 1933 At college, and perhaps for a year afterwards, they had believed in litera- ture, had believed in Beauty and in personal expression as an absolute end. (p. 35) July, 1932 . . . you are no longer white but golden brown so passing tourists have need of an indignant finger . . . ("Miss Lonelyhearts in the Dismal Swamp," p. 2) April, 1933 Your body is golden brown like hers, and tourists have need of the indig- nant finger of the missionary to point you out. (p. 79) The First Church of Christ Dentist . . . ("Miss Lonelyhearts in the Dismal Swamp," p. 2) . . . the First Church of Christ Dentist, where He is worshipped as Preventer of Decay. (p. 83) A great many of the revisions serve to make the finished work more active and vivid than the earlier drafts. Some of the changes were from passive to active voice: May, 1932 . . . the glasses and bottles with their exploding highlights sounded like a battery of little bells when they were touched together by the bartender. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," p. 24) April, 1933 The glasses and bottles, their high lights exploding, rang like a battery of little bells when the bartender touched them together. (p. 37) October, 1932 . . . junk that had been made precious by memory . . . ("Miss Lonelyhearts on a Field Trip," p. 52) April, 1933 . . . junk that memory had made precious . . . (p. 62) Sometimes the idea became more active through the use of entirely new wording: May, 1932 Someone suggested raping them. That started a train of stories. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," p. 22) April, 1933 Then someone started a train of stories by suggesting that what they all needed was a good rape. (p. 33) They would go on in this way until they were too drunk to talk. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," (p. 22) [They] would go on telling these stories until they were too drunk to talk. (p. 34) In other instances West revised the idea itself to make it more lively: May, 1932 After some pantomime suggesting colorful pageantry, he began again: "Brown Greek manuscripts and mis- tresses with great smooth marbly limbs." ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Dead Pan," p. 19) April, 1933 "To the renaissance!" he kept shouting. "To the renaissance! To the brown Greek manuscripts and mis- tresses with the great smooth marbly limbs." (p. 12) Miss Farkis laughed and Shrike looked as though he were going to punch her. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Dead Pan," pp. 20-21) Miss Farkis laughed and Shrike raised his fist as though to strike her. (p. 15) Providing additional details to form a more extensive context was one way in which West made the work more vivid: May, 1932 My sister and I were waiting for father to come home from the church. She was eight years old and I was twelve. I went to the piano and began to play a dance piece my Mozart. I had never voluntarily gone to the piano before. My sister began to dance. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," p. 24) April, 1933 One winter evening, he had been waiting with his little sister for their father to come home from church. She was eight years old then, and he was twelve. Made sad by the pause be- tween playing and eating, he had gone to the piano and had begun a piece by Mozart. It was the first time he had ever voluntarily gone to the piano. His sister left her picture book to dance to his music. (p. 37) His insertion of an extra detail for contrast made several scenes more dramatic and vital than they were in the original: May, 1932 I consciously lost myself in an evening long past. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," p. 24) April, 1933 He forgot that his heart was a bomb to remember an incident of his child- hood. (p. 37) I thought of children dancing. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," p. 24) As Miss Lonelyhearts stood at the bar, swaying slightly to the remembered music, he thought of children dancing. (p. 37) The elimination of a modifier strengthened the work in a few places: February, 1932 He had played with this thing, but he never allowed it to come entirely alive. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Lamb," p. 83) April, 1933 He had played with this thing, but had never allowed it to come alive. (p. 20) And the elimination of a subjunctive phrase served the same function by changing the figure from a simile to a stronger metaphor: May, 1932 And on most days I received more than thirty letters, all of them alike, as though stamped from the dough of suffering with a heart-shaped cookie knife. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Dead Pan," p. 13) April, 1933 And on most days he received more than thirty letters, all of them alike, stamped from the dough of suffering with a heart-shaped cookie knife. (p. 2) Occasionally the revision increased the subtlety. In the novel there is no forthright statement that the "clean old man" is really a homosexual, and the reader's curiosity remains delightfully unsatisfied; in the original version, however, there was no question about it: May, 1932 "Aw, come off," Gates said. "We're scientists. He's Havelock Ellis and I'm Krafft-Ebing. When did you first dis- cover homosexualist tendencies in yourself?" "But I do like women, Mr. Ebing. When I was younger I . . ." ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," pp. 25-26) April, 1933 "Aw, come off," Gates said. "We're scientists. He's Havelock Ellis and I'm Krafft-Ebing. When did you first dis- cover homosexualistic tendencies in yourself?" "What do you mean, sir? I . . ." (p. 40) And there are many examples of changes in single words in order to create vividness and vitality: "bootlegger" for "ciderman," "bloody" for "bloodstained," "punch in the mouth" for "blow in the mouth," and "fresh air" for "open air," for example. Some of the revisions improved the finished work simply by being more appropriate to the characterization. For example, in the revision of the long letter from the poorly-educated Broad-Shoulders, "things" replaced "articles" and "too many to write" replaced "too numerous to mention." In another chapter Miss Lonelyhearts' own age was changed from twenty to a much more likely twenty-six. 5 But other changes can be attributed to no other reason than West's own preference. Three times be changed the kind of alcohol, substituting brandy for champagne, beer for whiskey, and rye for whiskey in situations where it is hard to see how it could have made any difference (pp. 21, 38, and 40). And occasionally a revision seems unquestionably detrimental. One clear statement in the original became, when revised, ambiguous, and in its revised state it also raises the question of why the feature editor would be in charge of personnel: May, 1932 I would ask to be transferred to the sports department. ("Miss Lonelyhearts and the Clean Old Man," p. 24) April, 1933 He would ask Shrike to be transferred to the sports department. (p. 38) Another revision devitalized a scene by eliminating its shocking and hilarious repulsiveness and thereby reducing it to a rather ordinary incident: October, 1932 He drew back when she reached for a kiss. She caught his head and put her tongue into his mouth. At first it ticked like a watch, then the tick softened and thickened into a heart throb. It beat louder and more rapidly each second until he thought that it was going to explode, and pulled away with a rude jerk. ("Miss Lonelyhearts on a Field Trip," p. 54) April, 1933 He drew back when she reached for a kiss. She caught his head and kissed him on his mouth. At first it ticked like a watch, then the tick softened and thickened into a heart throb. It beat louder and more rapidly each second, until he thought that it was going to explode and pulled away with a rude jerk. (p. 66) But these two examples are exceptions; there are very few instances in which the revised version is not manifestly better than the original. Comparison of the early and late versions of these five chapters shows, then, not only that Nathanael West had a perceptive sense of literary structure and unity, but that he was as well a painstaking and astute reader and reviser of his own work. By experimenting with several methods of narration until he found the most appropriate one, by relocating various parts of the chapter so that the movement in each would be unrestricted and easily perceptible, by eliminating irrelevant themes and unifying those he retained, and by minutely reworking each individual sentence to condense and enliven it for the greatest possible impact, he showed himself to be a mature and conscious craftsman who knew the direction of his work of art and strove to make all its parts point in that direction. 6</field>

Contempo was an almost equally short-lived iconoclastic newspaper published in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. 2 Page numbers not otherwise identified refer to the New Directions edition of Miss Lonelyhearts , n.d. 3 Prof. Light makes some perceptive comments on the importance of this change, in Nathanael West , p. 83. There is a slight suggestion that the use of the interior monologue may have been the choice of the Contempo editors rather than the author. Much of the revision that West ostensibly made later consists only of inserting punctuation, and so, likewise, the interior monologue technique could have been brought about in the first place merely by omitting the original punctuation. Furthermore, there is one "my" in the monologue that seems to refer to an entirely separate person rather than to a part of Miss Lonelyhearts' mind. Still further evidence appears on another page in this same issue of Contempo : a letter from an irate contributor claims that his earlier contribution had been greatly changed without permission, and the editors, in a brief reply, rather crassly and fatuously defend their action. In any case, whether West's doing or not, the experiment was an unwise one. 4 The result of this revision is one example of the "static, pictorial quality" which Prof. Light shows is an integral part of the novel. See Nathanael West , pp. 95-96. 5 This change is in the Contempo chapter, and again there is room for suspicion that the editors there may have changed it originally. Twenty seems far too young in either the early or the revised version. 6 I am deeply indebted to Prof. James B.

      <field name="heading_text">A Further Note on the First Printing of the Great Gatsby by Matthew J. Bruccoli</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Bruce Harkness was preparing "Bibliography and the Novelistic Fallacy," 1 his very useful article on the printed texts of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby , he was unable to locate a copy of the third printing of the first edition. Since I have acquired this volume—and since it is scarce—it seems worthwhile to comment here on this printing. There were three printings of the first edition of the novel: April 1925, August 1925, and August 1942. 2 The third printing was issued after Fitzgerald's death and was probably quite small (information about the number of copies printed is wanting in the Scribner records I have examined); my copy is the only one I know of. The book is readily identified by the 1942 date on the title page. Although there are authorial changes in the second printing, and although Fitzgerald made additional corrections in his own copy of the novel, collation of the first and third printings on the Hinman Machine reveals that there are no fresh corrections or revisions in the third printing not present in the second. However, this collation did turn up a second-printing correction that Prof. Harkness missed: 211.7-8 Union Street station] Union Station. It is interesting that the galley proof at the Princeton University Library reads "La Salle Street station" at this point. 3 These galleys are so heavily revised, however, that they were almost certainly reset, and thus the change to "Union Street station" was probably made by Fitzgerald in the reset galley proof. There is no "Union Street station" in Chicago. If Nick's recollections of his trips home from school are based on Fitzgerald's, then the Union Station would have been where Fitzgerald changed from the Pennsylvania Railroad to the Milwaukee or Burlington for the trip to St. Paul. If Fitzgerald had come to Chicago on the New York Central, this would have brought him in at the La Salle Street Station; but he would then have gone to the Union Station. Hence it is likely that in the reset galley Fitzgerald inserted "Union" for "La Salle"—neglecting to cross out "Street"—which resulted in the incorrect first-printing reading "Union Street station".</field>
