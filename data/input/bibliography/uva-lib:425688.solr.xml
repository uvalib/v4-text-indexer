      <field name="heading_text">The Early Editions and Issues of The Monk, with a Bibliography by William B. Todd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">UNTIL 1935 THE INVOLVED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF Matthew Lewis's The Monk received only cursory attention. Then, as if to redress this lapse, a sudden flurry of notes offered various representations, each contributing a little to an understanding of the problem, more to a realization of its complexity. 1 Eventually, however, Mr. Frederick Coykendall's "A Note on 'The Monk'" 2 brought this phase of the discussion to an end by an account that was not subsequently questioned by those concerned. Yet it seems advisable to reopen the case of The Monk on the basis of a variety of evidence, some of it new, but much of it previously overlooked or in need of reinterpretation. From 1935 until now the status of The Monk has rested on these several compromises: (1) Contrary to the report in the Life of Lewis, in Lowndes, and elsewhere, no edition was printed in 1795; (2) notwithstanding conflicting statements in booksellers' catalogues, neither the second nor the fifth edition was the first to be expurgated, but rather the fourth; (3) for some reason there were two distinct "issues" 3 of the first edition, the one completely reset from the other; and (4) these "issues" are not of a certain order but the reverse of that order. Examination may well begin with a review of the various opinions concerning the two "issues" of the first edition. Several months before Mr. Coykendall made known his own conclusions, Mr. Philip Brooks observed that, while the "1796" ( i.e. 1818) Waterford edition was recognized as falsely dated, it was not generally known that there were two legitimate 1796 London issues, the one published in March, and the other "with certain verbal changes, mere corrections of misprints" in April of that year. 4 Extending this discussion, Mr. Louis Peck remarked that there was editorial revision as well, particularly in the last several pages of the novel. The concluding passage in the first issue, it was noted, gave a protracted description of Ambrosio's death agonies; whereas in the second this passage was deleted and replaced with another reading "Haughty Lady . . . ." For Mr. Coykendall this latter analysis was misleading: the misprints, he added, are to be found in the Haughty Lady rather than in the Ambrosio issue. Thus, he concluded, the Haughty Lady version was the first of the two. The two issues in this order, Mr. Coykendall continued, are indicated by certain entries in the Monthly Magazine , which for March, 1796, lists The Monk as published at 9 shillings, but for April quotes the price as 10s. 6d. 5 The difference in price should be taken as signifying the difference between the Haughty Lady issue and the one that was later corrected. From this follows the hypothesis that when the one was recognized as having errors, it was at once discounted, and superseded in the next month by another sold at full price. To confirm this hypothesis we are given a list of misprints selected as peculiar to the first issue; but we are not given what is also required, a collation of early editions to demonstrate the uniqueness of the peculiarity. When such a collation is actually made we find, on the contrary, that the peculiarity does not exist. Cited as "misprints," 6 for instance, are the readings "no mean" and "frequently"—both in the so-called first, or Haughty Lady issue, but also in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th editions. Similarly the word "feelings" is also found in the 2nd and 3rd editions. It would seem, therefore, that the corresponding words—"some", "occasionally", and "failings"—are actually the original rather than the revised readings; and as these occur only in the issue designated as the second 7 there is strong evidence for reversing the order and considering this as the first. If so ordered, the first or Ambrosio issue presents one set of readings, all others another. Moreover, such a sequence as I suggest permits a very simple explanation for what is so involved in Mr. Coykendall's account of the final passage in the novel: the first issue would carry the description of Ambrosio's sufferings, all later ones the Haughty Lady paragraph. Also considered to be of some significance, as we have noted, is the apparent relationship between the "misprinted" Haughty Lady issue and the 9 shilling quotation in the March number of the Monthly Magazine . This equation, of course, assumes the accuracy of the discounted quotation, an assumption that is, unfortunately, invalid. Against this single reference to 9 shillings in the Magazine can be opposed twelve to 10s. 6d. for the initial price: the Edinburgh Magazine 's list of books published in March, 1796, 8 and the entries in the Oracle for March 12, the Morning Herald for March 12, 14, 16, the Sun for March 11, 14, and April 19, 9 the Times for April 4, 10 and the Morning Chronicle for April 16, 18, and 23. All of these contradict the price quoted in the Monthly Magazine , and none, it should be observed, marks any chronological distinction between issues. Moreover, an entry as yet unmentioned indicates the probable cause of what is undoubtedly an error in the Magazine . Shortly before the date of publication, when all the papers quoted the price as 10s. 6d., the Morning Herald (March 9) announced that the price would be 9s. Here then is the likely source of an error twice made, and twice corrected at the insistence of the publisher, who had no intention of offering the book at a discount. On the evidence of the price quoted in the Morning Herald for March 9, immediately corrected—it should be observed—in the March 12 number, the Magazine entries almost certainly do not refer to two separate issues, nor do they indicate—if there were two—that one has precedence over the other. Hence, from the first, uncorrected entry, the sole reference on which so much of Mr. Coykendall's argument depends, no conclusions can be drawn. Another piece of evidence which has been taken as substantiating the sequence is that the March, Haughty Lady issue of The Monk carries on the verso of page 315, third volume, an advertisement for two books, whereas in the April, Ambrosio issue this page is blank. One thing only may be said of advertisements: if they refer to books published before a first issue they may be cited in that issue; but if they refer to books published at a later date, then, in ordinary circumstances, no issue can represent them except one coincident with or subsequent to the date of their publication. When were these books in print? Investigation discloses that the two works cited in the advertisement, Henry Somerville and The History of Inventions and Discoveries , were published not in March, 1796, nor in April, 1796, nor even in the year 1796, but in April, 1797. 11 Thus the esteemed "first issue" is not the earliest issue of the first edition, nor—as we shall see—of the second, nor of the third, but something else of considerably less bibliographical interest. Authorities on The Monk may accordingly dismiss all talk of two early reset issues in any sequence and present as the true first-edition sheets those without advertisements, and without the Haughty Lady passage. Before proceeding with the issues of this legitimate first edition I may be allowed a remark in retrospect. Had the various commentators carefully examined the title-leaves for the three volumes of the supposed "first issue," they would have noted evidence which would have affected their arguments. These leaves are cancels, 12 of lighter paper than the text, sometimes bearing the watermark date 1794, 13 and—in every copy examined—carrying vertical chainlines, an obvious sign of cancellans in an edition of duodecimo format. Since these are not the original titles, therefore, it follows that 1796, although certainly the date to be assigned to the issue , is not necessarily the date inherent to the original sheets of the edition. The comment just made applies, I now suggest, to the legitimate first published issue as well. Here again, and again as bibliographers have failed to note, the title-leaves for all copies I have seen are cancels, this time of the horizontal-line variety. In view of this discovery, is it unreasonable to infer that the 1796 imprint is likewise assigned and represents, for this issue, the alteration of a 1795 date that originally appeared? The evidence against an original date of 1795 admittedly appears to be so overwhelming that the earlier tradition for it is now generally ignored. At one time Lowndes was thought to have been the first to make the ascription, but in 1935 Mr. Brooks pointed to the Life of Lewis as the source, 14 followed by Mr. Coykendall, who observed that an unusual phrase in the Life —"published in the summer of 1795"—is later quoted verbatim by Lowndes and Allibone. 15 This attempt to derive the Lowndes statement concerning a 1795 edition from the passage in the Life cannot be sustained since Lowndes first appeared in 1834 and the Life was not published until 1839. 16 The fact is that both the actual Lowndes ascription to 1795 and the specific statement in the Life had been anticipated by Watt. 17 Indeed, as one moves toward the author and away from the guesswork present in recent discussion, all attempts to explain this 1795 date as an error lead only to its validation. Besides the testimony of Watt and Lowndes, both reputable bibliographers, there is earlier confirmation in the numerous obituaries of Lewis, 18 all of which not only concur in 1795 as the original date for The Monk , but on occasion emphasize the date by reference to events of "the following year" which we know to have taken place in 1796. 19 These accounts too, of course, as they are confused on other details, may also err in this; but if so, definite proof should be offered. Conclusive evidence, perhaps the only evidence, will reside in the original title-leaves to the first edition, and these have yet to be recovered. 20 Nevertheless, the available evidence offers a very powerful case. Confirming the 1795 date mentioned in the obituary reports are other accounts more approximate to the work itself. In September, 1794, Lewis, then at the Hague, wrote his mother that The Monk had been completed. The following month he sent her verses from the novel 21 and added to the Preface what may be regarded as an explicit , the dateline "Oct. 28th, 1794." By December, at the latest, he was back in London looking for a publisher, and found one in Joseph Bell, who printed the work on paper dated 1794. The reiteration of the date, twice by the author in letters, once in the Preface, and throughout in the watermark is certainly evidence of a sort for 1794 as the year of publication. But obviously, the time-interval is cut rather fine, and there is no more reason for inferring from these indications that everything happened within several weeks than there is for assuming, without any evidence, that nothing whatever happened for sixteen months. As a compromise, therefore, I propose that in the absence of proof either for 1794 or for 1796 we return to the 1795 tradition, and agree that while a few pre-publication copies were probably distributed in that year—enough at least to establish the report—the actual first published issue was withheld for some reason until March, 1796, when it officially appeared with new title-leaves. 22 Thus far the results of our investigation have led, quite unintentionally, to a denial of what everyone has accepted and a reinstatement of what everyone has denied. We now approach problems which have not previously been treated. Having reduced the number of known first-edition issues from two to one, we come upon what seems to be a reissue of the first edition under false pretenses. A unique copy of this issue in the Sadleir-Black Collection at the University of Virginia has the same sheets throughout and the same cancellans title-leaves in volumes 2 and 3 as the first issue of the first edition, but the title-leaf for volume I has again been cancelled and replaced with another reading "The Second Edition." The new cancellans, however, was not taken from the legitimate second edition, for among other differences the author's name is still unrecorded. Normally we should expect this previously unrecorded issue to represent a publisher's stratagem for stimulating the sale of a slow-moving book and thus assign its publication as sometime before October, 1796, the month in which the authentic second appeared. 23 Nonetheless we should pause before making this hypothesis to remind ourselves that any inference regarding this novel may be distrusted, and consider another possibility. From the moment The Monk was deposited at the bookstalls its reception by the critics undoubtedly prompted a demand which never diminished. Four London editions as well as a Dublin edition appeared within two years, and the imitations were legion. Within the first half year, then, there could hardly have been any need for pushing sales. In fact, only several months at the most could have elapsed before Lewis, realizing the necessity for another printing, set to work correcting and revising the readings to be introduced in the second edition. Now if, as I suggest, the exhaustion of the original supply was foreseen, and if the authentic second edition was published just before the supply ran out, then Bell may have been left with a few copies of the original issue, deemed imperfect by the author, and hence of no interest to a public clamoring for the latest version. Moreover, there is some reason to believe that a few copies were literally as well as textually imperfect. In the Virginia copy, at any rate, six gatherings are missing (vol. II, sigs. H-N), the consequence, perhaps, of a miscalculation when the sheets were counted out at the time of printing. Such a defection, so accounted for, would in itself constitute sufficient reason for keeping these on the shelf until such time as no copies except these were available for sale. The occasion facilitating the disposal of these remainders occurred, I suggest, six months after the second edition had been published. On the 15th of March, 1797, a ballet adapted from the subplot of The Monk and entitled Raymond and Agnes was performed at Covent Garden. On that very day Bell made a curious announcement: J. Bell . . . informs his Friends and the Public that a few remaining Copies of the second Edition may be had by applying as above. The reason of this Address is owing to a report of the Book being out of Print, and as a Grand Ballet is to be brought forward this Evening taken from the above Work, many people may wish to see the Book before the performance; and as it will be some months before a new Edition can be ready to supply the demand he has given this notice. 24 The report of the second edition being out of print gains some credence from Bell's effort to deny it; just as his advice that another edition was "some months" hence is belied by the appearance of the third edition within five weeks. What was being offered, I believe, was the imperfect and spurious "second," brought forth not to create a demand, but to meet one beyond expectation. In passing, let us not forget the first volume title-leaves excised, or laid aside, to make way for this "second edition"; they will reappear in rather strange circumstances. Concerning the true second edition little need be said since it is the only one of the early printings that seems to have retained its integrity. Issued in October, 1796, it includes on the title-pages for the first time the name of the author, proudly designated as "M. G. Lewis, Esq. M. P.", 25 and in the text a number of revisions retained thereafter, notably the insertion in one of the poems of a stanza inadvertently omitted before, 26 the suppression of the passage describing Ambrosio's seven days of suffering, and the substitution of another beginning "Haughty Lady . . . ." Had Lewis decided to remain anonymous at this time the bibliographical history of his novel would never have resembled the incredible story that now unfolds. But so enamored was he of the recently bestowed title "Member of Parliament" that he could not resist divulging his position as well as his name. The news sent every mouth agape. Here, to the horror of all, was the spectacle of a man elected to office that he might preserve morality in the realm, and acknowledging as his a work apparently designed to corrupt all morals. The criticism following this disclosure was for awhile complacently disregarded and, as we might expect, served only to speed the publication of a third edition to meet the mounting demand for copies. 27 Three months and a day after this edition appeared, however, there sounded a blast which could not be ignored either by Lewis or by the authorities in a position to act against him. This was The Pursuits of Literature , by Thomas James Mathias, 28 a work to which Coleridge alludes as one of "the most vapid satires," valuable only for its notes on contemporary writers. 29 Its value to Coleridge is its value to us, for in the notes to the fourth part, notes added and expanded, revised and rearranged with each succeeding edition, we find a running commentary on Lewis and his work. Since The Pursuits represents, therefore, an ideal vantage point for witnessing the later history of The Monk , I refer to certain pertinent remarks. In an introduction to the fourth part Mathias pauses before this novel as something too peculiar and too important to be passed over in a general reprehension. There is nothing with which it may be compared. A legislator in our own parliament, a member of the House of Commons of Great Britain, an elected guardian and defender of the laws, the religion, and the good manners of the country, has neither scrupled nor blushed to depict and to publish to the world the arts of lewd and systematic seduction, and to thrust upon the nation the most open and unqualified blasphemy against the very code and volume of our religion. 30 After denouncing the legislators for failing to act against a member of their own house, he affirms that Lewis is at any rate liable before the "tribunal of public opinion" where he may "be made ashamed, or alarmed, or convicted." "Before that tribunal," he continues, "and to the law of reputation, and every binding and powerful sanction by which that law is enforced, is Mr. Lewis this day called to answer." 31 The idea that the author might be liable as well before other and more effective tribunals seems to have occurred to Mathias at this juncture, for he then cites several paragraphs from the seventh chapter of the novel as blasphemy " actionable at Common Law ", 32 and gives a list of precedent convictions for similar offenses, those involving Curll, Cleland, Woolston, and Paine. Now unquestionably Lewis was aware, to his discomfort, that the Proclamation Society was at that very time proceeding against Paine's publisher, one Thomas Williams; 33 hence the coupling of his name with the author of The Age of Reason and the insistence that the one writer was no less guilty than the other may have prompted Lewis to consider a way out of his difficulties. If he was uncertain as to what he might do, Mathias was ready with a suggestion. "The publication of this novel by a Member of Parliament is in itself so serious an offence to the public , that I know not how the author can repair this breach of public decency, but by suppressing it himself." To this note he subtended another: "Or Mr. Lewis might omit the indecent and blasphemous passages in another edition; there is neither genius nor wit in them, and the work as a composition would receive great advantage. I wish he may at least take this advice." 34 It remains to be determined whether Lewis followed these recommendations of his own volition, or upon compulsion, or not at all. Certainly Mathias's attack could not have gone unnoticed by the vigilantes appointed to enforce the King's proclamation against vice, and as there is some contemporary talk of a court action, it is plausible that they anticipated any move Lewis might have considered by securing a legal decision against him. The scattered gossip gleaned from a vague reference in the Life 35 and more specific comment in the obituaries 36 suggests that both Lewis and Bell, his publisher, were indicted by the Court of King's Bench, probably at the instigation of the Proclamation Society, then headed by Beilby Porteus, Bishop of London, 37 and that a decree nisi was obtained against them, requiring the publisher to recall all copies of the third edition and the author to prepare another edition properly expurgated. By November, 1797, word of this decree must have come to Mathias, for in a note dated that month and added to the fifth edition of The Pursuits he implies that his earlier remarks are no longer applicable, but are retained for the record. 38 Unless there was court action somewhat as I have described it, Mathias would have had no knowledge at this time of Lewis's enforced resolve to make amends, and Bell would have had no reason for so effectively recalling copies of the third edition that only one can be found today. If we postulate that all but a few copies of the third edition were suppressed, then we will have little difficulty in accounting for their ultimate disposition. Was there any way a publisher could sell perhaps a thousand copies, thus realizing with a profit his original investment, and yet keep within the letter of the law? There was a way, and the resourceful Bell was not one to overlook it. One can imagine that his inspiration was induced by the chance discovery of some leaves stowed away on a warehouse shelf—the cancellans title-pages to volume one of the first issue, first edition, removed, we will remember, eight months before when he passed that edition off as the second. If he could make the first a second, he reasoned, why not make the third a first? What a simple device for circumventing an injunction applicable only to the third edition! On reconsideration he may have had a qualm about such an unethical and in a sense unlawful procedure; but if so, it was only momentary, and passed with the thought that unless he could sell these copies now he could sell the public nothing for some months to come. So resolved, he excised the three title-pages of the third edition, affixed to volume one of each set the old pages he had on hand, and as a matter of economy, or negligence, allowed the book to be sold without titles for the second and third volumes. One of these sets Lewis secured as a text for revision, and this unique copy, with his MS notations, is now at the British Museum, catalogued, I might add, as the first edition with corrections for the second, though actually, as we see, the second issue of the third edition with corrections for the fourth. 39 Encouraged by the success of this covert venture, Bell now considered the problem of moving the rest of his contraband. Since the number of copies he had sophisticated in the manner described was small, corresponding, of course, exactly to the number of copies from which the first edition title-page had been removed, he prepared to run off new titles for the remainder of his stock. But instead of using one of those from the first edition as a model for the new setting, doubtless because he had just disposed of these, he reverted to the form of the third-edition title-page, there crossed out references to the name of the author and the edition, and had new ones struck off for all three volumes. Now this was a blunder for, as altered, there still remained recognizable differences between the real and false first issues. In the one, for instance, the quotation from Horace precedes "In Three Volumes", while in the other, as in all editions after the first, the quotation follows the volume reference. Not this, however, but another difference must have aroused indignant comment. As it was no doubt pointed out to Bell by some irate patron, this could not pretend to be the "original edition," for instead of reading "M.DCC.XCVI." it bore the date "M.DCC.XCVII.", a date carried over from the third-edition copytext. Somewhat embarrassed by this disclosure, Bell may immediately have stopped the sale, moved all copies to the warehouse, and retired in confusion. The only thing to do, he thereupon seems to have decided, was to trust his good fortune that the several copies already sold would not be commonly recognized as fraudulent, and to avoid any further unpleasantness by altering the date of those that remained. Fortunately, as this was in roman rather than arabic digits, a few scrapes with a knife were sufficient to obliterate the offending "I." Removing the "I", however, necessarily involved removing the accompanying period; and the absence of this final mark, it will be observed, distinguishes this state from any other variant of The Monk . Here, then, is the disguised and defaced specimen usually masquerading as the "first issue, first edition," but revealed to be nothing more than a doctored second state of the third issue, third edition. So that the assigned position of this issue may be incontrovertible I return now to Mr. Coykendall's argument, and to his own copies, which he has kindly allowed me to examine. It is granted between us that the third edition and the three variants described are all composed of the same sheets. In Mr. Coykendall's discussion, however, it was not recognized that the title-page for the second issue differed from that for the third, nor was the original state of the third considered except as an anomaly. As for the relation between the third edition and what is now known to be the doctored state of the third issue of that edition (his "first issue, first edition"), Mr. Coykendall has this to say: The most obvious explanation of this seems to be that the publisher had kept back the sheets of the first issue because of their errors, and finding himself faced with a demand for a new edition simply bound up the first issue sheets with a new third edition title page, and thus produced a third edition at little cost. . . . It is reasonable to assume that the author told the publisher of his intention to revise the book for a new edition, and that the publisher therefore thought it best to distribute all copies of the book in its original form before the new edition should appear. We therefore come to the conclusion that the third edition consists of sheets of the first issue with a new title page. 40 To this explanation there is a ready answer. Since, in Mr. Coykendall's own copies, the title-leaf volume 1, third edition, has horizontal chainlines exactly conjoined, as they should be, to those in leaf A4, whereas the title-leaf for the "first issue" has vertical chainlines not at all corresponding, the third edition is beyond question the first, not the last of the sequence, and all variants, in the order suggested, are necessarily subsequent to it. Having been led into an initial misconception by taking the physically conjugate title-leaf of the third edition for a cancellans, Mr. Coykendall discerns another characteristic of the issues which is not borne out by the evidence. Here then is an opportunity for the skillful forger to insert a manufactured title page in a copy of the third edition and produce a false first issue. The collector should note, however, that in the first issue the leaf [A4] containing the Advertisement on recto and Table of the Poetry on verso precedes the Preface, while in the third edition this leaf, as in the second issue and the second edition, follows the Preface, and has the Table of the Poetry on recto and the Advertisement on verso. 41 This difference is merely accidental. So long as A4 is attached to the title-leaf it will remain in position A4. But if the title is excised, and the book trimmed and later rebound, then A4, disjoined from A1 on one side and from A3 on the other, is free to move to any position according to the whim of the binder. 42 Where this disjunction has occurred, as in the several issues of the first edition, and all but the first of the third, I have found A4 in any of the positions A2, A2 v , A4, and A4 v . The particular disarrangement Mr. Coykendall describes might have been recognized as an aberrancy had it been noted that with A4 before the registered signature A2, the latter is unaccountably in position A3. With this explanation we have succeeded, I believe, in unravelling the last of a number of puzzles. A word needs to be said, finally, of Joseph Bell's enterprise in selling his issues fabricated from the third edition without arousing the suspicion of the authorities. Not wishing to precipitate the investigation which would surely follow a public announcement in the papers, Bell, for awhile at least, seems to have depended upon a wink and a nod to promote his under-the-counter trade. Later on, though, he apparently decided to risk an advertisement in one of Lewis's plays, where it would come to the attention of those interested in this author and his notorious romance but not, he hoped, to those less sympathetically inclined. Accordingly he inserted in The East Indian (1800) the usual announcement for the fourth edition of The Monk and then, for the first time, a further notation: "In this edition the Author has paid particular attention to some passages that have been objected to.—A few remaining copies of the original edition may be had by applying to the Publisher." The announcement, I suspect, met with an immediate response, for by the time the fifth edition was out Bell was selling his fakes at twice the original price. " The First Edition ," readers of Adelmorn the Outlaw (1801) are informed, "may be had at the Publisher's, price One Guinea." As there are no later advertisements, I conclude that after five years of maneuvering and subterfuge the last copy of this spurious first issue had been sold, the last in a series of impostures and deceptions had gone undetected, from then until now. It is, in a way, a tribute to Bell's ingenuity that his final, his most audacious fraud, including his doctoring of the date, should not only have been accepted as the "first issue" but in more recent years have been vigorously defended as such.

Nevertheless I allow it to stand in anticipation of later comment which reveals these to be, in fact, issues , but not in the relationship generally presumed. 4 Brooks, op. cit. , p. 21. 5 Monthly Magazine , I (1796), 139, 228. 6 This is, I believe, a misnomer, since it is inconceivable that the compositor looked at the word "some" and read "no mean", or at "occasionally" and read "frequently". 7 According to Mr. Coykendall's analysis these readings, among others, exemplify the order of variants: Vol. I " 1st issue " " 2nd issue " 2nd &amp; 3rd eds 4th &amp; 5th eds human failings 31.19 31.2 human feelings 31.19 31.19 Vol. II some skill 73.19 no mean skill 73.19 73.19 73.19 occasionally composed 73.22 frequently composed 73.22 73.22 73.23 8 Edinburgh Magazine , XXIII (1796), 298. 9 Though Friday, March 11, would seem to be the date of publication, the Morning Herald for the 9th advertises the book as to be published "on Saturday next" [the 12th]; and as all the papers except one make no announcement until Saturday, the Sun entry for the day before is doubtless premature. 10 In the imprints and advertisements for all editions only the name of J. Bell is given as publisher. The Times entry for April 4 suggests, however, that there were, at least for the first edition, several promoters: "Printed for J. Bell, No. 148, Oxford-street; E. Booker, New Bond Street, and C. Law, Ave-Maria lane." It may be remarked that the principal agent, usually identified as John Bell, a celebrated editor and bookseller of the day, was an obscure individual by the name of Joseph.

Also advertised in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th editions of The Monk . 12 For this as well as for several other issues of The Monk I judge the three title-leaves to be cancels if the first is not conjugate to A4, and if the disjunct second and third titles have readings identical with the first. 13 Mr. Coykendall erroneously asserts this issue to be a mixture of 1794 and 1796 w/m dates. 1796 belongs to the text; 1794 as his own and other copies show, is found, I believe, only in the title-leaves (in his it appears on the leaves to volumes I and III), and may be distinguished from the same date in the first issue by the "7" and "9" being approximately 1 cm. longer than the "1" and "4". The w/m for the editio princeps is a fleur-de-lis, dated throughout 1794, all figures of equal length, and with c/m initials "M&amp;L". 14 Brooks, op.cit. , p. 21. 15 Coykendall, op. cit. , p. 88. The Life and Correspondence of M. G. Lewis (London, 1839), I, 151. 16 Actually, the Life ( loc. cit. ) reads: "publication . . . which event took place in the summer of 1795." The phraseology of the bibliographies is not drawn verbatim from this passage and indeed is so dissimilar as to fail to indicate derivation from this source: as an example, neither Lowndes nor Allibone mentions summer as the time of publication. Cf. Lowndes, The Bibliographer's Manual (London, 1834), III, 1128; (1860), V, 1353; (1883), III, 1353; (1889), V, 1353.

Marrot ( Biblio Notes &amp; Queries , I, no. 1 [January, 1935], p. 4) the catalogue of Archdeacon Wrangham's library lists a copy dated 1795. Perhaps this may be traced and the question settled. 21 Life , I, 133-34, 142-48. 22 What appears to be evidence against 1795 as the date is an entry in the Morning Herald for March 3, 1796, announcing The Monk as "in the press." I am persuaded that nothing can be made of this. In the first place, as will be amply demonstrated in this paper, Bell's advertisements are meaningless and at times deliberately misleading. Moreover, the phrase itself had no more significance for works to be issued than the conventional "Published Today" had for works issued months before. It may mean, for The Monk , that the new title-leaves were being struck off, or be nothing more than advice to the reader that publication is pending. As an instance of the latter connotation see Richard Savage's use of the expression in the Plain-Dealer (November 30, 1724) with reference to his Miscellaneous Poems , not published until 1726. In 1724 at least one of the poems had yet to be written, for the event which it celebrates, the Duke of Rutland's inoculation for the small pox, did not occur until April 5, 1725 ( British Journal , April 10, 1725). Another example of its use is in Nichols' Anecdotes , III, 49, where Bowyer is said to have printed, in 1767, Lyttelton's History of the Life of King Henry the Second , a work "which had been at least ten years in the press." From these several illustrations it may be agreed that the term has no other implication than that the publisher had contracted for the work. 23 The entry in the Analytical Review , XXIV (October, 1796), 403-4, the only one I have been able to find for the second edition, gives a title-page citation corresponding with this, but not with the spurious "second" edition. 24 Morning Chronicle , March 15, 1797. 25 In July of that year Lewis was elected as the new member of Parliament for the Borough of Hindon. See The London Chronicle , July 7-9, 1796. 26 The poem is the one entitled "Inscription in an Hermitage." As the stanza omitted in the first edition appeared in the transcript Lewis sent his mother in 1794, I presume it was present but overlooked in the fair copy submitted to the printer. 27 From the only announcement discovered, the one in the Chronicle Chronicle for Saturday, April 15, 1797, that the third edition would be published "On Tuesday next," I presume the date for this to be April 18. 28 The part of interest to us, the fourth, was first published July 19, 1797 ( Chronicle Chronicle ), a second edition on September 11 ( Chronicle Chronicle ), a third apparently in the following month, a fifth on January 27, 1798 ( London Chronicle ), and many more thereafter. The fourth edition of this Part, though not so designated, is actually that which was included in the consecutively paged fifth edition of all parts issued in January, the earlier dialogues having by this time already passed through four editions. 29 The Friend: A Series of Essays (London, 1818), II, 12-13. 30 The Pursuits , 1st ed., 4th part, pp. ii-iii. 31 Ibid. , p. v. Had he known of it, Mathias would have been thunderstruck at Sir Walter Scott's report that Charles James Fox crossed the floor of the House to congratulate Lewis on his novel. 32 Ibid. , p. ii, note b.

The extent to which the Life was adulterated and refined can only be conjectured from sly inferences at the time. In a letter to an unidentified lady, Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, for one, confesses that the announcement of this work aroused "fearful apprehension" for his own and other reputations, but that having seen it he recognized the discreet hand of Sir Henry Lushington, Lewis's brother-in-law, in the choice of letters and Lady Charlotte Bury Campbell in the "cant as to religion." Sharpe then goes on to relate, presumably, the facts that had been suppressed, at which point his own editor cuts him off with an ellipsis! Perhaps what was divulged among other things, if we may believe the obituaries, was that Lewis, like his contemporary Wordsworth, fathered an illegitimate daughter. Not inconceivably this may have been the girl who, under the name of "Miss Mary G. Lewis," published a poem and two novels of her own: "Zelinda" (1823), Ambition (1825), and The Jewish Maiden (1830). Circumstances, initials, surname, and dates all support the conjecture. Letters from and to Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Esq. , ed.

For information regarding this and the Proclamation Society I am indebted to Professor Maurice J. Quinlan. Further data on the organization and proceedings of these societies may be found in his Victorian Prelude (New York, 1941), p. 54 passim . 38 The Pursuits , 5th ed., p. 295.

It is hoped and expected that no similar work will ever again be given to this country." 39 I am indebted to Mr. Harry Sellers of the British Museum staff for identifying the paper, advertisements, readings, and printers' marks which substantiate this as the third edition. 40 Coykendall, op. cit. , p. 94. 41 Loc. cit. 42 Gathering A 4 was probably imposed as the lower third of sheet L, cut off, and then folded like an accordion strip. A displacement of A4 would be unlikely, therefore, unless the book were subject to the treatment described.

      <field name="heading_text">The 'Second Issue' of Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida, 1609 by Philip Williams, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN THAT COPIES OF THE 1609 quarto of Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida differ: some copies have a title-page on which it is stated that the play '. . . was acted by the Kings Maiesties | ſeruants at the Globe' whereas in other copies this title-page has been can-celled 1 and replaced by a half-sheet signed a . The new title-page ( a 1) changed the original 'THE | Hiſtorie of Troylus | and Creſſeida' to 'THE | Famous Hiſtorie of | Troylus and Creſſeid', deleted the statement about performance at the Globe, and added in its place ' Excellently expressing the beginning | of their loues, with the conceited wooing | of Pandarus Prince of Licia .' The remaining portion of the title-page (from ' Written by William Shakeſpeare' on) was printed from the standing type of the original title-page. 2 The second page of the cancellans ( a 2) contains an address to the reader (concluding on a 2 v ) in which the play is said to be ' a new | play, neuer stal'd with the Stage, | neuer clapper-clawd with the palmes | of the vulger '. Except for these differences all copies are identical; hence those having the original title-page are usually considered 'first issue' and those in which the cancel has been effected, 'second issue.' 3 Three copies of the quarto having the original title-page but lacking a 2 are extant. 4 One copy contains both the original title-page and a 2 . 5 Eleven copies in which the original title-page has been cancelled and replaced by the half-sheet a 2 are extant. 6 The question of exactly when and how the half-sheet signed a was printed has never been investigated, 7 nor has a satisfactory explanation why some copies of the book appear with and some without the second title-page been advanced. 8 Critics, indeed, have seemed content with the implicit assumption that some copies do not contain the cancel since they were sold at a time prior to the printing of the cancellans half-sheet. It is the purpose of this article to show first that the half-sheet signed a was very probably printed along with the final half-sheet M of the text as a pre-publication cancellans, and secondly to offer a plausible explanation why in some copies the cancel was not effected. Fredson Bowers 9 has shown that bibliographical evidence can often be used to prove that different parts of a book were or were not printed on a full sheet and subsequently cut in half. In a book having a collation like 4°, A 2 B-M 4 N 2 , with A 2 containing the title-page and preliminary matter and the text ending on N1 or N2, the possibility that A 2 and N 2 were printed together on a full sheet has been recognized for some time. Indeed, it has come to be accepted as the normal method of printing in such circumstances. But a quarto half-sheet gathering can also be printed by half-sheet imposition, the four type-pages being imposed together and a full sheet printed and perfected by this same forme, the two halves later being cut apart to provide identical half-sheets. Dr. Bowers shows that it is dangerous to assume that two half-sheet gatherings appearing in the same book were printed together unless running-title evidence confirms this assumption, and he demonstrates that when the running-titles from only one forme used to print a preceding full sheet of text are used in both formes of the final half-sheet, this half-sheet must have been printed by itself by half-sheet imposition. If the running-titles from both formes used to print a preceding full sheet of text appear in the two-leaf gathering, the half-sheet was not printed by itself by half-sheet imposition but instead with something else. Twelve running-titles contained in three skeleton-formes were used in printing Troilus and Cressida , from which two skeleton-formes were drawn to print gathering L. In inner L, the following running-titles appear: L1 v (IV), L2 (IX), L3 v (III), and L4 (VIII). In outer L, the following running-titles appear: L1 (X), L2 v (I), L3 (VII), and L4 v (II). Two running-titles appear in M 2 :(X) on M1 and (IV) on M1 v . It will be noted that the running-title from L1 v (inner forme) appears on M1 v (inner forme), and the running-title from L1 (outer forme) appears on M1 (outer forme). The final two-leaf M gathering of Troilus and Cressida cannot therefore have been printed separately by half-sheet imposition. Since M was not printed in this manner, it is necessary to assume that another half-sheet was printed along with it. 10 I suggest there is strong evidence for believing that this half-sheet was a 2 , printed in the same formes with half-sheet M 2 . First, it will be remembered that the lower portion of the title-page contains standing type from the original title-page. This suggests, although it does not prove, that the cancelling title-page was printed soon after the original title-page (A1). At any rate, the interval of time between the printing of the original title-page and the cancelling title-page was so short that the type from the original title-page had not been distributed. Second, buttressing the typographical evidence for the relatively continuous printing of the cancel with the body of the book is the evidence of the paper. Sheets A-M consistently contain a watermark of a gauntlet with the third finger surmounted by a cross. Since in certain copies where a watermark appears in the a half-sheet, the watermark is invariably this same gauntlet, the inference follows that the cancel was printed on the same lot of paper Eld bought for the rest of the book, and as a consequence that it cannot be separated by any very long period of time from the printing of the text sheets. Indeed, this evidence, as well as that of the standing type from the title, may be more narrowly applied, for both would ideally obtain if a and M had been printed in the same formes. Under such conditions it is ordinarily found that one of the two separated half-sheets in any single copy will contain a watermark and the other will not. In the observed copies, this is what we find; for example, in the Folger copy the watermark appears in a but not in M, whereas in the Yale Elizabethan Club copy the watermark is in M but not in a . 11 Thus the watermarks demonstrate at least that the printing of a could not have been long delayed after the completion of the book, and their evidence is not inconsonant with the hypothesis that both a and M were printed in the same full sheet. 12 Thirdly, the evidence supplied by the type-page measurements supports the belief that a 2 and M 2 were printed together. If a 2 were printed along with M 2 , using the two skeletons from L, the measurements of the type-pages in a should conform with the measurements of the type-pages of L. If the measurements do not coincide, the inference would be that a 2 and M 2 were not printed together. The measurements do coincide, and therefore the a type-pages seem to have been composed in the same printers' stick used for the text so that they would fit without adjustment of the furniture into the skeleton-formes used to print L and M. 13 In view of the bibliographical evidence that has been presented, it seems more than probable that a 2 was printed simultaneously with M 2 , the type-pages having been imposed as is indicated below: If this theory of how a 2 was printed is accepted, the time at which it was decided to cancel the original title-page can be determined with some precision. The decision must have been made after outer A had been printed but before either forme of M had been printed. 11 1/2 sheets intervene between outer A and M. If only one press were used and if the edition ran to the maximum 1250-1500 copies, we may estimate that L was completed approximately 15 working days after printing on A began. 14 We must now attempt to explain why three of the extant copies contain the uncancelled title-page (A1) whereas in eleven copies the cancel of A1 has been effected and a 2 substituted. (The Yale Elizabethan Club copy is, of course, aberrant and would align itself with the eleven copies in which the cancel was made.) Although it is dangerous when dealing with only fifteen copies to make much of percentages, the three surviving copies in which the cancel has not been substituted suggest that in the original edition possibly a sizable number of copies existed in this state. Several hypotheses must be considered before coming to the explanation I think to be the correct one. Troilus and Cressida was printed by George Eld for two publishers, Richard Bonion and Henry Walley. 15 It is possible, though perhaps unlikely, that one of the two publishers definitely preferred the original title-page with its reference (rightly or wrongly) to performance at the Globe by the King's Men. If so, he could have directed his binder to ignore the cancel in the copies allotted to him. Or—much less likely—both publishers, acting jointly, may have deliberately allowed some copies of the book without the cancel to be issued, holding back the cancelled copies with the expectation that the new title-page and preface would stimulate sales at a later date. This particular speculation should not be taken too seriously, for it is unlikely that the publishers, having gone to the trouble and expense of the cancel as a part of continuous printing of the quarto, would deliberately issue copies without that cancel. Moreover, there is no evidence that the altered form of the title would have stimulated sale. Unless we are willing to suppose that one or both of the publishers deliberately issued some copies without the cancel, we must look elsewhere for an explanation. Our knowledge of early 17th-century binding practices is, unfortunately, limited; but it seems probable that the answer to our problem lies here. 16 Most of the copies of Troilus and Cressida were correctly bound: a 2 was added and A1 cancelled. But it is probable that in some copies, through accident or error, 17 the cancel was not made. The most recent attempt to define issue and variant state reaches the general conclusion that there are only two major classes of reissue: (1) post-publication alterations in the publishing or selling arrangements as indicated by a cancellans title-leaf; (2) post-publication alterations or additions in the book accompanied by or confined to a cancellans title-leaf to assist in stimulating sales of old sheets. Additions or alterations made to constitute what may be called ideal copy should be considered as 'states,' whether made before or after publication. Among such 'states' are specifically placed cancellans titles "printed as part of an original sheet (whether of the preliminaries or of the text) to perform the same function as a press-variant title." 18 If a 2 and M 2 were indeed printed simultaneously, and if the copies containing A1 but lacking cancellans a 2 are the result of binding error or accident to some of the half-sheets and not demonstrable as a distinct publishing effort, the implications are clear: the so-called 'first' and 'second issues' of Troilus and Cressida are not separate issues at all; and they should therefore be treated as W. W. Greg treats the similar case of The Dumbe Knight (1608), 19 that is, as variant states of only one issue. But the classification, while important, is after all basically only one of estimating accurately the true conditions of printing and publication. The bibliographical evidence which can be brought to bear to assess the cancel in the first quarto of Troilus and Cressida indicates very strongly that the alteration in the title and the consequential printing of the address to the reader were decided on and manufactured before any copies of the book could be issued. No collateral evidence exists which would lead to a conclusion that intentional separate and simultaneous issues were made of copies in the two forms: reissue is, of course, a practical impossibility owing to the circumstances of printing. 20 If the bibliographical evidence is accepted as a sufficient demonstration, we must alter our views materially concerning the time at which this cancel was printed and, to some extent, the circumstances which dictated it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Until H. P. Stokes, in his introduction to the Griggs facsimile ( Shakespeare Quarto Facsimiles , No. 13 [1886]) demonstrated that the title-page with the reference to performance at the Globe was earlier, it had generally been held that the a title-page was first. The editors of the Cambridge edition (1863-66) had accepted the erroneous order. 2 William Aldis Wright, The Cambridge Shakespeare , 2nd. ed. (1892), IV, viii, noted that the lower portion of both title-pages had been printed from the same type. 3 W. W. Greg, A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration (1939), No. 279, so considers them, as does Henrietta Bartlett, A Census of Shakespeare's Plays in Quarto, 1594-1709 (1939), p. 121. R. B. McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927), p. 177, suggested that in books like Troilus and Cressida (which he cites) the new matter might constitute merely a cancel and not a separate issue. 4 British Museum, Huntington, and Rosenbach. 5 In the Yale Elizabethan Club copy, half-sheet a is inserted before the original title-page. It is impossible now to determine whether this represents the original state of this copy or a later sophistication. The copy is the Daniel-Huth-Cochran one, bound in morocco with Daniel's monogram. See Bartlett, op. cit. , p. 121. 6 Bartlett, op. cit. , pp. 121-22, lists twelve copies, assigning two to The Folger Shakespeare Library (nos. 1217 and 1218). No. 1217 is not at present in The Folger Shakespeare Library, and Dr. Giles E. Dawson, Curator of Rare Books, writes me that a search of the library's records and of Mr. Folger's papers reveals no evidence that Mr. Folger or the library ever owned this copy. I have been unable to locate it elsewhere. Miss Bartlett describes it (p. 121) as "The Quaritch (purchased privately, 1919, sold, 1920, £1500) copy. Bound in morocco." 7 Neither A. W. Pollard, Shakespeare Folios and Quartos , (1909) nor Peter Alexander, " Troilus and Cressida , 1609," The Library , 4th ser., IX (1928), 267-86, attacked the problem. E. K. Chambers, William Shakespeare (1930), I, 442, suggested that Bonion and Walley (the publishers) decided to cancel the original title-page when they realized that the play had never been produced on the public stage. Chambers presents the generally accepted theory as to why the cancel was printed but (like Alexander and Pollard) does not consider the how or when (save for the general conclusion that at some unspecified time after the original title-page had been printed, the publishers decided to effect the cancel). 8 William Aldis Wright, op. cit. , VI, vii-viii, suggested that "copies with this [the original] title-page were first issued for the theater, and afterwards those with the new title-page and preface for the general reader." This highly doubtful speculation has not met with general approval. 9 "Running-Title Evidence for Determining Half-Sheet Imposition," Papers of the Bibliographical Society, University of Virginia , I (1948-49), 199-202. 10 It seems most improbable that the printer would impose an inner forme with one page of letterpress and three blank pages, and make up a similar imposition in another skeleton for the outer forme. Since in some copies of Troilus and Cressida blank leaf M2 is preserved conjugate with M1, such printing would have given a blank half-sheet fold which has always been removed. This possibility need not be considered seriously. 11 This condition would be found if the two half-sheets in individual copies had been cut apart from the same full sheet, or if they had been cut apart in series at some prior time but bound in fairly consistent order with this earlier operation. Dr. Bowers has kept records of Restoration play quartos and informs me that when running-titles indicate two half-sheets were printed together, the vast majority of copies will not have clashing watermarks (or their absence) in the two separated parts. The evidence is not invariable but is strongly weighted in this direction. 12 If, on further examination, copies are found to contain watermarks in both a and M (or lack watermarks in both), I do not think this would seriously discount the other evidence afforded by the watermarks. 13 The measurement of the full type-pages in L and M is 157(164) x 87 mm. The horizontal measurement may vary slightly from 86 to 88 mm. in other sections of the book, but in L and M it is 87 mm. for all pages, the measure found in half-sheet a . Eld did not invariably use an 87 mm. measure in printing play quartos. In three other quartos printed by him at about this time, the following measures are used: The Divils Charter (1607): 94 mm.; The Puritaine (1607): 92 mm.; and Ram Alley (1611): 90 mm. It would seem therefore more than coincidence that the horizontal type-page measurement of the type-pages in a 2 should coincide with the measurement of the type-pages in L and M. 14 If two presses were used, the time would be cut approximately in half. If fewer than the maximum copies were printed, the time would also be somewhat less, but it is unlikely that the edition was smaller than 1250 copies. Any decision about the number of presses involved in printing this quarto must await further investigation now in process. 15 Neither Bonion nor Walley was a printer; both were booksellers and publishers. Walley's shop was 'The Harts Horn in Foster Lane' from 1608 until 1655. Bonion's shop was 'The Spread Eagle near the great North Door of St. Paul's Church' from 1607 until 1610. See R. B. McKerrow, A Dictionary of Printers and Booksellers, 1557-1640 (The Bibliographical Society, 1910), pp. 42-43, and H. R. Plomer, A Dictionary of Booksellers and Printers, 1641-67 (The Bibliographical Society, 1907), p. 188. 16 In his account of the duties of the warehouse-keeper, Moxon describes activities that are more closely related to the binding than the printing of books. His account probably applies to the large post-Restoration printing establishments and may not accurately describe conditions that prevailed 75 years earlier in the smaller Elizabethan shops. According to Moxon, the job printer delivered his work to the bookseller with the sheets 'gathered,' 'collated,' 'folded,' 'pressed,' and thus ready to be sewn. However, it seems more likely, according to fragmentary evidence for the earlier period, that Eld would have delivered unfolded sheets tied up in bundles according to signature. Nothing is said in Moxon's account about marking pages to be cancelled or about cutting a sheet in half that contained two separate half-sheets. Eld may or may not have cut the a M sheets; the surviving can-cellanda are not marked in any way. 17 One may speculate about possible accidents and errors even though in this case it seems impossible to demonstrate that one or another occurred. If Eld divided the a M sheets before delivery, one bundle of a half-sheets may have been overlooked and thus never delivered to the publishers; or he may have delivered too few a half-sheets to one of the two publishers; or, while stored in a ware-house, one bundle of a half-sheets may have been damaged; or the publishers may have failed to include a half-sheets with one lot of sheets sent to the binder. If the a M sheets were uncut when they reached the binders, an error in arranging the sheets in 'heaps' for 'gathering' or some other careless mistake may have been made. One speculation, for which there is no evidence whatsoever, could be made that copies lacking a 2 represent printer's 'copy books.' See F. R. Johnson, "Printers 'Copy Books' and the Black Market in the Elizabethan Book Trade," The Library , 5th. ser., I (1946), 97-105. 18 Fredson Bowers, "Criteria for Classifying Hand-Printed Books as Issues and Variant States," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , XLI (1947), 291, n. 16. The reasons for this classification are elaborated in his Principles of Bibliographical Description (Princeton, 1949). Pre-publication changes to a book, machined as a part of its continuous printing, cannot constitute reissue except under the most unusual circumstances and can be classified as 'separate issue' only if it can be demonstrated that copies in each form were intentionally sold as a unit. Otherwise, variant forms resulting from pre-publication printing constitute only 'variant state.' 19 The Dumbe Knight , printed by Nicholas Okes in 1608, parallels Troilus and Cressida in many respects. (See W. W. Greg, A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration , No. 277). In this book, for which Greg gives the collation 4°, A-I 4 K 2 , the original title-page appears as A2 in some copies (A1 and A2 v blank). A3 contains an address to the reader, and the text begins on A4. In other copies, A2 has been cancelled and replaced by a new title-page, the only significant difference between it and the original title-page being the change of 'historicall' to 'pleasant' and the addition of the author's name. The lower portion of this cancelling title-page is printed from the same setting of type as the original title-page. Greg lists two copies having the original title-page only, three in which the cancel has been effected, and two in which both titles are present. He states that the cancelling title-page was almost certainly printed as K2, for in the Folger copy the cancellans and K1, though now separate, can be seen to have been conjunct. If the cancelling title-page were printed as K2, there were probably as many copies of it as of K1, i.e. the number of copies of the edition. One is naturally led to ask why the cancel was not carried out in all copies, since the ratio between surviving copies suggests that in a relatively large number the cancel was not made. Yet copies having the uncan-celled title-page probably represent a binder's error, as in Troilus and Cressida . 20 Indeed, if an accident happened to a pile of half-sheets so that copies lacking the cancel are not simply binders' errors, copies with the original title were probably the last lots to be sold and would have been placed on the market in this form not by intention but by necessity.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Warburton, Hanmer, and the 1745 Edition of Shakespeare by Giles E. Dawson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE NEGLECT BY MODERN EDITORS OF A 1745 edition of Shakespeare has led them into errors and false assumptions regarding eighteenth-century emendations of the text. This edition is in six octavo volumes with the following general title in the first volume: THE | WORKS | OF | SHAKESPEAR. | IN | SIX VOLUMES. | [rule] | Carefully Revised and Corrected | by the former Editions. | [rule] | — Nil ortum tale . — Hor. | [rule] | [ornament: a basket of flowers and foliage with 2 birds, 56 x 22 mm.] | [double rule] | LONDON: | Printed for J. and P. Knapton, S. Birt, T. Longman , | H. Lintot, C. Hitch, J. Brindley, J. and R. Tonson and | S. Draper, R. and B. Wellington, E. New , and B. Dod. | [short rule] | M DCC XLV. The editor is not named, either on this title or elsewhere, but the text is substantially that of the 1744 edition of Sir Thomas Hanmer printed at the Oxford University press, and the 'Advertisement from the Booksellers' (in vol. i) opens with the statement that 'This Edition is exactly copied from that lately printed in Quarto at Oxford '. In order to understand the nature of this 1745 edition, and the reasons for its importance, we must go back some fifteen or twenty years and examine the early connections of Sir Thomas Hanmer and the Rev. William Warburton with Shakespeare. Indeed the story actually begins with Lewis Theobald, who published in 1726 his Shakespeare Restored , an attack on Pope's editorial methods in his Shakespeare of 1725. At some time near the beginning of 1728 Theobald began what turned out to be a long and voluminous correspondence with Warburton in which the two men exchanged detailed critical and explanatory notes on the Shakespeare text. Theobald intended to publish critical remarks upon all the plays, similar to those on Hamlet of which Shakespeare Restored was chiefly composed. But by 1730 he wrote to Warburton that he had enlarged his plan and had now determined upon an edition of Shakespeare. Thereafter Warburton appears to have understood completely that the many notes which he continued to communicate to the editor were in fact contributions to this edition. Theobald accepted them, printed a large number of them as footnotes, nearly always assigning due credit for each, and devoted a paragraph of his preface to a grateful acknowledgement of Warburton's assistance. He did not use all of the contributions, however, and it was Warburton's hurt pride at the discovery of this, soon after the appearance of the edition in 1733, that led ultimately, about 1736, to a complete breach in the friendship of the two men. On 17 May 1734 Warburton wrote: I have transcrib'd ab t . 50 Emend. &amp; remarks w ch : I have at several times sent you, omitted in y e . Edition of Shakespeare w ch . I am sure are better than any of mine publish'd there. These I shall convey to you soon &amp;desire you to publish them (as omitted by being mislaid) in y e . Edition of the Poem[s], w ch . I hope you will soon make ready for the Press. A few days later he sent these emendations and notes (fifty-six of them) to Theobald. 1 But Theobald never published the edition of the Poems which he appears to have been considering, and Warburton's strange request came to nothing. Theobald adopted the very reasonable position that it was implicit in any such voluntary contribution of material that the editor should have a free hand to select or discard as he might see fit. Actually, if Theobald erred at all in the selection of Warburton's notes, it was by including too many, for Warburton was inferior to Theobald as a scholar and in his knowledge of Shakespeare and Elizabethan literature. Throughout the later relations of the two men, Warburton is revealed as a thoroughly petty and vainglorious man. 2 The next new edition of Shakespeare is that of Hanmer, which made its appearance in 1744, and in this, too, Warburton was involved. At what date Hanmer decided upon the preparation of an edition he nowhere tells us. In May 1737 Warburton spent a week at Mildenhall, Sir Thomas's seat, and at that time the baronet, though interested in constructing a 'correct text in Shakespeare,' had 'no thoughts at all of making it public.' 3 It is not known what motive led Warburton to seek Hanmer out—if indeed he did so. It is not unlikely that he had in the back of his mind even then an edition of his own. His quarrel with Theobald was still fairly fresh, and he may have been thinking of some means of doing himself the justice which he felt he had been denied by Theobald. In October 1737, five months after the meeting with Hanmer, he wrote to Thomas Birch: You are pleased to enquire about Shakespeare. I believe (to tell it as a secret) I shall . . . give an Edition of it to the World . Sir Thomas Hanmer has a true critical genius, and has done great things in this Author; so you may expect to see a very extraordinary edition of its kind. 4 This sounds as if some sort of cooperation between the two men was contemplated, but since in later accounts of their negotiations they contradict each other it is difficult to decide just what sort. In the letter to Joseph Smith quoted above Hanmer wrote: I am satisfied there is no edition coming or likely to come from Warburton, but it is a report raised to serve some little purpose or other, of which I see there are many on foot. I have reason to know that gentleman is very angry with me, for a cause of which I think I have no reason to be ashamed, or he to be proud. My acquaintance with him began upon an application from himself, and at his request the present Bp of Salisbury introduced him to me for this purpose only, as was then declared, that as he had many observations upon Shakespeare then lying by him, over and above those printed in Theobald's book, he much desired to communicate them to me, that I might judge whether any of them were worthy to be added to those emendations, which he understood I had long been making upon that author. I received his offer with all the civility I could: upon which a long correspondence began by letters, in which he explained his sense upon many passages, which sometimes I thought just, but mostly wild and out of the way. Afterwards he made a journey hither on purpose to see my books; he staid about a week with me, and had the inspection of them: and all this while I had no suspicion of any other design, in all the pains he took, but to perfect a correct text in Shakespeare, of which he seemed very fond. But not long after, the views of interest began to shew themselves, several hints were dropt of the advantage he might receive from publishing the work thus corrected; but as I had no thoughts at all of making it public, so I was more averse to yield to it in such a manner as was likely to produce a paltry edition, by making it the means only of getting a greater sum of money by it. Upon this he flew into a great rage, and there is an end of the story . . . This letter was printed in Biographia Britannica ( sub Smith) but, through the intervention of Warburton, then Bishop of Gloucester, was cancelled. Philip Nichols, one of the proprietors of Biographia Britannica , through whose efforts the letter had originally been obtained, attempted to prevent the cancellation, but was overruled. He thereupon issued, anonymously, a pamphlet entitled The Castrated Letter of Sir Thomas Hanmer, In the Sixth Volume of Biographia Britannica (1763), in which he printed (pp. 26-27) the letter to Smith. 5 This he followed by a reply from Warburton (originally contributed, Nichols says, to the St. James Chronicle of 1 November 1762, when the Bishop was still expecting the Hanmer letter to appear in Biographia Britannica ). This reply begins: Sir Thomas Hanmer's letter from Milden-hall to Oxford, Oct. 28, 1742, is one continued falshood from beginning to end. It is false that my acquaintance with him began upon an application from me to him. It began upon an application of the present Bishop of London [formerly of Salisbury] to me, in behalf of Sir Thomas Hanmer, and, as I understood, at Sir Thomas Hanmer's desire. The thing speaks itself. It was publicly known that I had written notes on Shakespeare, because part of them were printed; few people knew that Sir Thomas Hanmer had: I certainly did not know; nor indeed, whether he was living or dead. The falsehood is still viler because it sculks only under an insinuation that I made a journey to him to Milden-Hall, without an invitation, whereas it was at his earnest and repeated request, as appears by his letters, which I have still by me. After relating that Hanmer had first tried to interest a 'bookseller in London, of the best reputation' (Nichols says this was Tonson), Warburton continues: But the bookseller understanding that he made use of many of my notes, and that I knew nothing of the project, thought fit to send me this account; on which I wrote to Sir Th. Hanmer, upbraiding him with his behaviour . . . One can scarcely help feeling some little annoyance at the tone of nobility and insistent amateurism which Hanmer assumes throughout the whole affair. Scholarly reputation is nothing to him, and the thought of financial gain abhorrent. He has, he writes in the preface to his edition, 'made it the amusement of his leisure hours for many years past to look over his [Shakespeare's] writings.' Yet his conduct, not only in connection with Shakespeare but in other passages of his life, was that of a guileless and generous man. His fault was simplicity, and there was in him neither rancor nor deceit. Warburton's behaviour, in contrast, attracts little sympathy or confidence. Self-interest is too apparent in all of his relationships—with Theobald, with Pope, with Hanmer. Yet even his enemies—and he was not without them—did not accuse him of out-and-out lying. I think then that we can reconcile the opposed statements of Hanmer and Warburton without giving the lie to either of them. Bishop Sherlock, perhaps knowing of their common interest in Shakespeare, may well have brought them together in such a way that each felt himself to be the one complimented. During the 'long correspondence' that followed and the week at Mildenhall, Hanmer and Warburton may have exchanged comments on the text without either one mentioning clearly what was probably yet in the mind of each no more than an ill-defined notion of producing an edition. It is even possible that at that time neither had formed such a notion at all. It is certain that Warburton sent Hanmer many notes, which he thought 'mostly wild and out of the way'. A little later, thinking—or perhaps only dreaming—that Hanmer was going to help him, Warburton wrote the letter to Birch quoted above and then dropped some hints to Hanmer about advantage to himself. It is likely that in this he clumsily displayed his spirit of self-seeking pettiness which offended the guileless baronet. And so they quarrelled, and each man felt himself aggrieved. Then for some years Warburton, whose main path of promotion lay in the Church, was busy with The Divine Legation of Moses and other theological works. Hanmer meanwhile continued to amuse his leisure hours with his favorite author and so was able, a few years later, to make a gift of his edition to Oxford, himself paying for the handsome copper-plates by Hayman and stipulating only that the set should be even more sumptuous than Pope's elegant quartos of 1725 and that the price must not exceed three guineas. Aside from the impressive appearance of the six volumes when they appeared in 1744, it is difficult to find much good to say about Hanmer's edition. It competes with Warburton's of 1747 for lowest place among eighteenth-century editions. But palpable as they are, Hanmer's faults as an editor are those common to all editors from Rowe to Johnson. His method was theirs—to reprint the latest edition or editions, 6 accepting their emendations or guesses as the established text and further emending any passage the meaning of which did not strike his fancy. 7 All the editors made some pretence of examining or even collating first editions, but none were systematic in this, and all, persuaded of the corrupt state of the early texts, exercised varying degrees of license in correcting them. Hanmer was perhaps a little more arbitrary in his emendations and a little less sound in his judgments than most of the others—but not much. In one respect, however, he was clearly more culpable than any other—or at least more consistently culpable. He never, or almost never, gives credit to any of the earlier editors for the many emendations of which he has availed himself, and he supplies no textual notes. Along with his own he prints Pope's or Theobald's or Warburton's readings, quite silently, and occasionally he lifts an explanatory note equally without credit or comment. He merely wished to construct 'a correct text in Shakespeare', not seeking reputation for himself; and in his own generosity he simply embraced his fellow-workers in the field. Such methods are avoided by modern editors, like the Furnesses and their successors in the New Variorum. These want to know who is responsible for each reading and are punctilious in assigning credit for each. But when they come to deal with Hanmer and Warburton they are, without knowing it, too often working in the dark. As a result Hanmer has been given credit—or should I say discredit?—for a great many readings which belong to Warburton. To Theobald too, though much less often, have been assigned emendations which originated with Warburton. The sole value of the 1745 edition, which is the subject of this paper, lies in the fact that it constitutes, as I believe, a reliable key by which these errors can be corrected. The 'Advertisement from the Booksellers' informs the reader that the plan followed in this reprint of the 1744 Oxford edition of Hanmer is to mark those passages in the text altered by Hanmer and to 'place the discarded Readings at the bottom of the Page, as also to point out the Emendations made by Mr. Theobald , Mr. Warburton , and Dr. Thirlby , 8 in Mr. Theobald's Edition, which are used by this Editor'—that is by Hanmer. This is an accurate account of the method used, at no inconsiderable cost in labor, throughout the six volumes. Wherever, departing from the text as handed down by Pope, Hanmer prints an emendation of Theobald and his helpers (Thirlby and Warburton), or one of his own, the emended words are marked in the text of 1745 by a pair of small superior slanted lines, and a footnote is supplied. For example, in Merry Wives , V.iii.13, where Pope and earlier editions read 'and the Welch devil Herne? ' and Theobald alters ' Herne ' to ' Evans ', Hanmer follows the latter, with ' Evans '. In the 1745 reprint ' Evans ' is enclosed in the superior slanted lines, and a footnote reads ' Herne? . . . old edit. Theob. emend .' If the emendation was first proposed by Thirlby or Warburton, the appropriate name is given. If by Hanmer himself, the footnote simply gives the reading and assigns it to the ' old edit. ', without the emendator's name. The number of emendations so marked in the text and footnoted in one way or the other is very large. In six plays chosen at random 9 I find 527 in all; 409 are attributed to no one, which means that they are Hanmer's own; 60 are attributed to Theobald; 52 to Warburton; and 6 to Thirlby. The question which must now be considered is who could have done this work on the 1744 Hanmer text. It can be demonstrated, I believe, that it was Warburton himself. The 'Advertisement from the Booksellers' continues, after the sentence quoted in the paragraph just above: The changes in the disposition of the Lines for the Regulation of the Metre are too numerous to be taken particular notice of. As to the other Emendations and Notes of Mr. Warburton , which are for the most part marked likewise in this Edition, we are only commission'd to say thus much; " That he "desires the Publick would suspend their Opinion of his Conjectures 'till they see "how they can be supported: For he holds it as ridiculous to alter the Text of an Author "without Reasons assigned, as it was dishonourable to publish those Alterations "without leave obtained. When he asks this Indulgence for himself, if the Publick "will give it too to the Honourable Editor, he will not complain; as having no "objection why his too should not occupy the Place they have usurped, until they be "shewn to be arbitrary, groundless, mistaken, and violating not only the Sense of the "Author, but all the Rules and Canons of true Criticism: Not that the Violation of "these Rules ought to be any more objected to the Editor, than the Violation of the "Rules of Poetry to his Author, as both professedly wrote without any ." This curious advertisement clearly constitutes an attack by Warburton upon Hanmer—with special emphasis upon the latter's practice of appropriating other men's emendations 'without leave obtained.' It does not imply that Warburton performed the textual collation which gives the reprint its value. But though it is not improbable that he or Tonson, the publisher, employed some nameless hack for the more tedious part of the task, yet it is difficult to see how it could have been accomplished without Warburton's active collaboration—or indeed to see who else would have had any motive for its accomplishment. The greater part of the work, it is true, could have been done by anyone—simply by collating Hanmer's text with Theobald's and Pope's. In this way it would be an easy matter to determine where Hanmer departs from the 'old edit.'—from Pope, that is —and where he follows Theobald. Where Theobald has followed a reading suggested to him by Warburton or Thirlby, his footnote almost invariably makes this clear, and thus if Hanmer adopts one of these readings his source is apparent. But frequently one finds in the 1745 edition a note reading ' old edit. Warb. emend. ' when a glance at Theobald's text shows that that editor had not adopted the reading or even mentioned it in a note (as he occasionally did do) as a discarded possibility suggested by Warburton. These readings, then, appear in print for the first time in Hanmer's first edition; yet the textual annotator of 1745 assigns them to Warburton. Something like half of all the emendations claimed for ' Warb. ' in the footnotes of the reprint are of this kind. In light of what we know about Warburton's relations with Theobald and Hanmer it is not difficult to explain these assignments of emendations to him. We know that Theobald had declined to make use of some which Warburton felt were his very best. We have Hanmer's own statement that Warburton 'had many observations upon Shakespeare then lying by him' when the two men began corresponding, and that some of them Hanmer 'thought just'. The latter nowhere denies having used these, though how many of them he may have used he does not suggest and we have no way of knowing. There is in fact definite proof of his adopting some emendations which he could have got from no other source: for six of the fifty-six that Warburton sent (for the second time) to Theobald in May 1734 10 were adopted by Hanmer and are duly credited to Warburton in the 1745 footnotes. These six emendations follow (with Globe references): Com. of Errors , IV.iii.28. Theob. morris-pike MS and Han. Maurice -pike All's Well , IV.v.42. Theob. hotter MS and Han. honour'd John , IV.ii.255. Theob. murd'rous MS and Han. murd'rer's Romeo and Jul. , III.v.32. Theob. would they had MS and Han. wot they have Othello , IV.i.42. Theob. instruction MS and Han. induction Ant. and Cleo. , IV.xv.10. Theob. Burn the great Sphere MS Turn from th'great, &amp;c. Han. Turn from the Sphere The treatment of these and other emendations claimed by Warburton in the 1745 footnotes at the hands of New Variorum editors and the old Cambridge editors (1863-66), shows that the 1745 edition ought to be better known than it has been. The elder Furness, it is true, appears to have known the fifty-six emendations and notes preserved in MS—probably from Nichols's Illustrations —for he properly assigns many of them to Warburton. He so treats the above Othello and Antony and Cleopatra emendations. But for no discernible reason he assigns the Romeo and Juliet reading to Hanmer. It is certain that neither he nor the Cambridge editors used the 1745 edition, and the same can be said of more recent editors of New Variorum volumes. None of these lists that edition among those collated or refers to it in any way. Three additional examples (where the MS is not involved) will make the point clear: Macbeth , I.ii.14. Theob. quarry Han. quarrel (claimed by Warb.) Cambridge attributes emendation to Hanmer, Furness to Johnson! 1 Henry IV , III.ii.13. Theob. attempts Han. attaints (claimed by Warb.) Cambridge and Hemingway attribute emendation to Hanmer. 2 Henry IV , IV.i.175. Theob. purposes confin'd Han. properties confirm'd (claimed by Warb.) Cambridge and Shaaber attribute emendation to Hanmer. In view of Warburton's animosity toward the Oxford editor one might well question his trustworthiness to perform his task in an even reasonably judicious manner. There does not seem to be any way of proving, for example, that he did not appropriate to himself, in the 1745 footnotes, more emendations than he had a right to. But to me it seems unlikely that he did such a thing. Neither Hanmer nor anyone else is known to have made such a charge. Zachary Grey, whose Word or Two of Advice to William Warburton (1746) takes Warburton to task for the 'Advertisement' of 1745, gives no hint of this kind of dishonesty. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary we must, in my opinion, assume that Warburton's assignments of credit for emendations are accurate and reliable. Accordingly we must in the future attribute to Warburton those emendations claimed by him in the 1745 reprint. A few words remain to be said about the publication of the edition. At the beginning of the century the Shakespeare copyrights were divided between the Tonson firm and the Wellington firm, the former owning the greater part. 11 In spite of the Copyright Act of 1710 these firms continued with fair success to claim the exclusive right to publish Shakespeare. All but one of the important editions from Rowe (1709) to Johnson (1765) were in fact published by the Tonsons—usually in association with the Wellingtons and often, as in 1745, with a number of other booksellers. The one exception was the Oxford edition of 1744—Hanmer's first edition—which in the eyes of the Tonsons and Wellingtons constituted a brazen piracy. On 11 April 1745 Jacob Tonson III, having seen proposals of Edward Cave to publish an edition of Shakespeare, wrote in a letter of warning to Cave: I doubt not I can shew you such a title as will satisfy you . . . and I will then give you my reasons why we rather chuse to proceed with the University by way of reprisal for their scandalous invasion of our right, than by law. 12 What his reasons were we do not know, but the reprisal almost certainly consisted of the publication of the cheap reprint of 1745—a sort of piracy of a piracy. Not only was it cheap, and thus designed to undersell the stately Oxford edition, but, as we have seen, the 'Advertisement from the Booksellers' contains a vicious attack upon the very book to which it is prefixed. When this 'Advertisement' asks the public to 'suspend their Opinion of his [Warburton's] Conjectures 'till they see how they can be supported', it seems clear that Warburton was at work on his own edition. This was published in 1747—by the Tonsons and their associates. We may infer, then, that in 1745 Warburton had already entered into an agreement with his publishers. Though it is not improbable that it was the Tonsons who initiated the reprint—as a protest against the 'piracy', in order that they might not give the appearance of acquiescing in it—it is difficult to see how they could have regarded the careful textual apparatus as a necessary adjunct to it. It is therefore probable that this was added at the suggestion of Warburton as his own personal revenge on 'the Honourable Editor'. He may have wished at the same time to establish his own right to the emendations which he had supplied to Hanmer—most of which he was to use in his own edition of 1747.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Warburton had evidently kept copies of all the emendations and notes which he had through their long correspondence sent to Theobald. These, together with the letters in which they had probably been embodied, are not known to have survived. But Theobald's letters to Warburton, from 1729 to 1733, were preserved by the latter and are now in the Folger Library, bound in two large volumes (cs 873). With them in the second volume are transcripts, by an amanuensis but with interlined corrections in Warburton's hand, of half a dozen letters from Warburton to Theobald written in 1734. With these latter is a transcript of the 56 emendations and notes, together with several more additional notes sent later. The whole contents of these two MS volumes are printed (almost certainly from the Folger MS) by John Nichols in Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century , II (1817), 189-648. 2 For a full account of the relations between Theobald and Warburton see R. F. Jones, Lewis Theobald, his Contribution to English Scholarship with some Unpublished Letters (New York, 1919), chapters 5 and 6. 3 Letter of Hanmer to Dr. Joseph Smith, Provost of Queen's College, Oxford, 28 Oct. 1742. 4 This letter is printed in Nichols, Illustrations , II, 71-77. 5 He asserts (p. 17) that he 'found the offensive sheet had been withdrawn, and a new one put into its place, printed so much wider as was necessary to fill the same space, without Sir Thomas's letter.' In the three copies which I have seen (Folger and Huntington) the letter is present (leaf 41Q2, pp. 3743-44) and there is no sign of cancellation. But there is good evidence that the cancellation (of the whole sheet) was carried out and that the Folger and Huntington copies are not three which escaped with the cancellandum in place. Instead I am convinced that in these copies—and probably in all others—the sheet as it now stands is a second cancellans, substituted for the first one (from which the letter was omitted). On p. 3780 ( sub Spelman) is a note quoting from Warburton's Shakespeare Preface a statement relating to his quarrel with Hanmer. This statement, the editors say, came to their attention 'since the letter at the end of Dr Joseph Smith's Article was printed off.' And they add that if they had seen it in time, it 'should have been inserted as a marginal note to the aforesaid letter of Sir Thomas Hanmer.' But as the letter now stands in the Smith article the statement has been inserted as a marginal note, to which is added a reference to the note on p. 3780. It seems probable then that Philip Nichols ultimately prevailed with the editors to restore the Hanmer letter. It is from Biog. Brit. , p. 3743, that I quote the letter above. It is also printed by John Nichols, Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century , v (1812), 588-89, and by Sir Henry Bunbury, The Correspondence of Sir Thomas Hanmer, Bart. (1838), pp. 85-88. 6 Hanmer printed from the 1725 Pope, but he appears to have intended originally to use the 1733 Theobald edition for this purpose. A set of the latter in the Folger Library has been heavily annotated throughout (except for Titus, Macbeth , and Othello ) in his hand as if to prepare it for printer's copy. But he seems to have changed his mind about this and probably transferred these annotations and emendations to a copy of the 1725 Pope. 7 A good example is Hanmer's reading of Othello , I.i.21: Pope and Theob . damn'd in a fair wife Hanmer damn'd in a fair phyz But it would be unfair to Hanmer not to offset this by mentioning the fact that a number of his emendations have met with general acceptance by later editors— M. N. D. , I.i.187, for instance. 8 Styan Thirlby, of Jesus College, Cambridge, a friend of Theobald's, contributed a number of notes and emendations to Theobald's edition. 9 M. W. W., A. Y. L., John, Rich. III, A. &amp; C., Hamlet . 10 See note 1 above. 11 For an account of the Shakespeare copyrights see G. E. Dawson, 'The Copyright of Shakespeare's Dramatic Works' in Studies in Honor of A. H. R. Fairchild (University of Missouri, 1946), pp. 11-35. 12 Ibid. and Pegge, Anonymiana (1809), p.34.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Library of Elizabeth's Embezzling Teller by Leslie Hotson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SELDOM DOES ONE COME UPON A VIRTUALLY complete valuer's list of the books owned by an Elizabethan squire. An added spice in the present case is the reason for the appraisal: their owner is being "sold up" to make good what he embezzled out of Queen Elizabeth's till. The culprit is no petty unknown, but one of the four worshipful Tellers of her Exchequer of Receipt, Richard Stonley, esquire, who by patent has enjoyed his life-appointment since February 19, 1554 (1 Mary). The commission out of the Exchequer to find out and seize his property is dated February 9, 1597. It states that he had wrongfully convertted to his own use £12,608 of the Queen's money. Another statement makes the sum £12,779 13 s . 3¾ d . Either way the amount is enormous; but since we may assume that a quarter of all the Queen's monies, incoming and issuing, for some forty years had passed through his hands, Stonley was used to large sums. Why he embezzled, over how long a period, and how he was detected, we have still to learn. But the Queen did not lose by Richard Stonley's peculations. Hers was the prudent habit of choosing as her financial officers men of substance. What sometimes happened to less substantial defaulters we read in Stow's Annales under date of January 1589/90: " Nicols one of her Maiesties purueiours was hanged, for that he conuerted to his owne vse certaine prouision taken of her subiects for her Maiesties vse." Richard Stonley was however an old servant of the Queen's, and owned lands in six different counties, as well as house property in London. Some properties of his in Kent, Essex, Bucks, and Oxford were sold for the Queen, together with the "Castle" in Holborn. The last was bought by Lord Burghley and his son for £1000. 1 Others in Essex were seized into the Queen's hand to make up the remainder out of income. But at his death on February 19, 1600, Stonley's widow and his two daughters (aged 40 and 36) were no doubt able to look forward to getting this part of the estate back again when the debt was cleared. 2 Obviously Elizabeth was not vindictive, and had no intention of ruining her teller's family. The list of books following is drawn from the complete appraisal early in 1597 of Stonley's goods at his dwelling house in Aldersgate Street, St. Botolph's extra Aldersgate, London. 3 His books exhibit him as a man of cultivation, well seen in the languages. The list is full, varied, and interesting. Much could be done with it in the way of identification classification, analysis—which I do not propose to do. I am content to lay out the titles as I find them in the parchments, and invite anyone interested to make the most of the material. I have made no consistent attempt to expand abbreviations, and any additions of my own are in italic or enclosed in square brackets. Since several of the titles are unknown to me, I cannot hope to have avoided blunders, and shall be happy to be corrected.

      <field name="heading_text">Early Binding Stamps of Religious Significance in Certain American Libraries: A Supplementary Report by Eunice Wead</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A STYLE OF BOOK DECORATION WHICH HAS attracted very little attention in this country and yet offers ample opportunity for study, is the infinitely varied blind-stamped binding of the 15th and first half of the 16th century. Some years ago an article by the present writer entitled "Binding Stamps of Religious Significance in Certain American Libraries" appeared in The Colophon (Part 20, 1935), describing examples found in a comparatively small number of libraries. Since then the search has been extended from the Library of Congress and other eastern libraries to the Huntington Library in California, and an interesting new group of stamps seem worth reporting upon and illustrating. The scope is limited as in the previous paper, and the intention is not to reproduce designs which may easily be found in books familiar to students of binding, but to offer a few which to the writer at least are new. It is a pleasure to acknowledge the permission kindly given by the various libraries and individual owners to illustrate the bindings under discussion. Since bindings decorated in blind, that is without the use of gold or color, are less familiar to book collectors than the more ornate specimens with gold ornament, it may be well to explain briefly the technique of producing them. The earliest and simplest method was to make relief impressions, one at a time, upon dampened leather with a small deeply engraved die or stamp, which was heated before using, and there are scattered examples of this technique as early as the 10th and 11th centuries, though its great flowering of artistic development did not come until the 12th. After a gap of two centuries which have left almost no examples, the 15th offers an enormous number of bindings adorned in this manner. In the late 1400's a second method was devised, the use of the roll, by which a repetition of one or of several designs engraved on a small wheel could quickly be obtained. Sometimes the roll is used in combination with single stamps, sometimes alone, or again combined with the third form of decoration, the panel. By using this comparatively large die, the cover of a book could be more rapidly filled than by repeated impressions of a single tool, or even by repeated rows of a design applied by a roll. This panel stamp was also of metal engraved in relief, intended to be tied onto the dampened leather of a book cover and inserted into a heavy press. Its period of greatest use was the first half of the 16th century, but there are earlier examples, one of them, according to a Dutch authority, as early as the 13th century. For artistic interest, the panel is greatly superior to the two simpler methods, for its ampler surface gives opportunity for delineation of scenes as well as of single persons, and some of the panels are comparable in fineness of execution to contemporary woodcuts and engravings, from which indeed some of them are copied. The reader concerned with the background of this subject must certainly consult the work of three English authorities—Weale, who pioneered in the 1890's in publishing an account of the blind-stamped bindings of the South Kensington Museum 1 and whose unfinished research on similar bindings in the British Museum was continued by another hand; 2 Goldschmidt, whose two volumes discuss and illustrate his own remarkable collection, since dispersed; 3 and Hobson, 4 whose great knowledge ranged over the whole field of binding, and included meticulous study of blind-stamped specimens from the 12th through the 16th centuries. The copious notes and explanations of these last two writers are delightful reading. From them and others to whom they refer one may learn many things, for instance that these bindings were produced in both monastic and commercial establishments, some of which may be recognized by certain small stamps peculiar to them; that it is sometimes possible to determine ownership of the volumes by recognizing characteristic stamps such as the arms of a monastery, or its patron saint, or more obviously its name on a scroll or label in gothic lettering. The reader will also see how a careful student goes about trying to localize a binding which may lack its own identifying stamps, attaching great importance to the pattern by which the stamps are arranged, and to the waste material which may have been used to line the covers and back, and to inscriptions of ownership or anything else showing provenance. Furthermore, he will observe that it was the custom to send books out from the printing centers all over Europe, in unbound sheets, and that comparatively few instances are recorded of a printer or publisher, in the period under discussion, selling his books already bound. Therefore—and this should be emphasized—place of printing and of binding are by no means necessarily the same, in fact they are often widely separated. So in this paper inclusion of the place of printing is for the interest of incunabula study rather than that of binding. All these points and infinitely more in the way of information and elucidation may be found in the books referred to. Examples of blind-stamped bindings are not hard to find in American libraries, and are nowhere near so scarce as are the persons who have been interested enough to pay attention to them. It takes a little trouble sometimes to make out the intaglio designs of single stamps which are often as small as a dime and seldom larger than a quarter dollar, and are often clearer in rubbings than in the original impressions. Numerically the designs run into the thousands, some of them purely conventional, some of flowers and vines, birds and animals both actual and mythical like the wyvern, griffin, and others from medieval bestiaries, some representing hunting scenes and other secular affairs. The leathers which take particularly well the impressions of the metal dies are calf and pigskin, stretched over wooden boards as a rule, and for the most part on folios, or, less frequently, quartos. The panels are mostly on smaller books. Our examples are nearly all on brown calf folios over wooden boards, and this may be assumed unless otherwise specified. The calf varies in quality from a very fine and highly polished to a decidedly rough surface, and in color from light to reddish brown. Details of bevelling of the wooden boards, of clasps and catches, headbands, and other technical matters are omitted as not of general interest, though of importance to students of binding technique. Our imprints are for the most part German incunabula and many famous printers are here represented. Likewise the stamps may be assumed to be of German workmanship unless otherwise stated. Our illustrations are produced from photostat negatives of pencil rubbings made directly from the books. Negatives are used rather than positives, as they are clearer. The exceptions are Fig. 4, made from a photostat of the book itself, not from a rubbing, and Fig. 21, which is a positive. All illustrations are of the actual size of the originals. The panel stamp being the latest is also the highest development artistically of decoration in blind, so we begin with a specimen found quite unexpectedly during the recent war, when the treasures of the Army Medical Library of Washington were stored for safe keeping in Cleveland. It represents Our Lady of Pity (Fig. 1), appearing on both covers of a small folio (Averroes' Colliget: liber medicina , printed at Venice in 1482), surrounded by a leafy border formed by a roll. Details were submitted to Mr. Hobson, then at work on his monograph Blind-stamped Panels in the English Book Trade , c1485-1555 . 5 He added this to his list of panels, calling it almost certainly Flemish in origin, of the 16th century. The gothic inscription surrounding the central figure reads: 'Salve mater | dolorosa iuxta crucem | lacrimosa | in ualle tristitie' |, which suggests of course the familiar Stabat Mater. Mr. Hobson's comment is "no doubt the opening of a hymn. The first line is quoted in Julian's Hymnology from a manuscript Horae of about 1440 in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge (MS.258;B.11.19). Unfortunately, this is inaccessible at present, so it is neither possible to say whether the second and third lines correspond with those on the panels, nor whether the hymn is a variant of the Stabat Mater, as Julian says, or a completely different composition as the different third lines indicate—the third line of the Stabat Mater being 'Dum pendebat filius'." Mr. Hobson was writing during the war, and no doubt the manuscript to which he refers is now available for some student of hymnology to settle this point. Cyril Davenport's Cameo Book Stamps (1911) illustrates by a line drawing a similar but not identical panel with the same inscription, while Dr. Ilse Schunke 6 describes under the heading "Pietà Meister," but does not illustrate, a panel which seems to be identical in both design and size. It should be noted that her description is in an article on Cologne rolls and panels, but she was writing several years before Mr. Hobson, whose work represents later research. Another panel of possible Flemish origin and much artistic charm is on a small binding in the library of Union Theological Seminary in New York (Fig. 2). It covers an octavo imprint from Antwerp (Rosemond, Confessionale , 1518) together with one from Paris of 1503 and another from Leipzig of 1518. An inscription on a flyleaf reads: "liber B Mariae in Huisborg", i.e. the Benedictine monastery Huyseburg in the diocese of Halberstadt. The upper cover shows a graceful halo-ed figure with flowing hair and draperies, who seems to be pouring something from her bowl into a bowl or plate held by a small figure whose head comes only as high as her knee. The tiled pavement and the wall against which she stands are decorated with a conventional flower which may be a rose, and this together with her gesture of bounty suggests that the lady may be St. Elizabeth of Hungary. Thanks are due to Dr. Edgar Wind of the Art Department of Smith College for this attribution. Mr. Hobson (in a letter to the writer) commented that no other panel of her is known, and that her usual crown is not discernible in this not very clear impression. As to this latter objection, a checking of numerous references in the Princeton and other iconographic indexes reveals several representations with halo but no crown, and it is hoped that raising the question here may invite further discussion. Incidentally, Holbein's painting of St. Elizabeth in the Munich Gallery shows a similar attitude, but here the crown is visible. In our reproduction of the binding, the dark tongue at the right is the leather clasp extending from the lower cover. A panel of a quite different sort, though less decorative and in our example badly worn, has nevertheless proved to be of great interest. This represents one of the angels of the Apocalypse (Fig. 3) on a binding belonging to Holy Name College, Washington, D. C. (Alexander de Hales, In Psalmos , Venice, 1496). The central figure stands out against a starry background, and with the help of the description in Revelation X, one can imagine this "mighty angel come down from Heaven," "his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth," one hand lifted up to Heaven and in the other a little book open. "And I went unto the angel and said to him, 'Give me the little book.' And he said unto me, 'Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.'" It is the Latin words of the angel's dismal command which form the surrounding gothic inscription, well-nigh illegible, but by a triumph of erudition and patience it has been interpreted by the librarian of Holy Name College, Fr. Barnabas Abele, O.F.M., and supplies the clue for identifying this particular Apocalyptic angel. He sends this version of Revelation X, 9, reading from the upper left corner: "Accipe librum, et devora illum: et faciet amaricari ventrum tuum, sed in ore tuo erit dulce tamquam mel." The book once belonged to the Minorites of Brussels, according to two inscriptions within, and there are other details to suggest that it was bound in the Netherlands. Here is another instance of a long journey from a printing press on the shore of the Adriatic to a bindery all the way across Europe. In the Walters Gallery in Baltimore is a panel which presumably has not been reproduced, though it is described by Weale (R490) as of Burgundy origin, and shows the Annunciation beneath a crocketed canopy. The binding of lightish brown calf encases an early 15th century vellum manuscript Book of Hours of Paris use. The identical panel with some of the same and some different border stamps is on a binding belonging to Mr. J. Christian Bay, Librarian Emeritus of the John Crerar Library, Chicago. Here the design appears on both covers of a charming illuminated manuscript of the Hours of the Blessed Virgin, and shows, like the Walters binding, evidence of French origin and ownership. The manuscript belonged as recently as 1906 to the famous library of George Dunn of Woolley Hall, near Maidenhead. Our illustration (Fig. 4) is from the lower cover of Mr. Bay's book, and reproduces the whole cover, to show the borders of small square stamps and of oblong stamps with a hunting scene, the whole surrounded by a fleur-de-lis design made by a roll. There must be many examples of panels, rolls and single stamps of interest in the possession of other American book collectors. One of them, Mr. Howard Goodhart of New York, has been kind enough to permit illustration of a pair of panels on the binding of a late 15th century Dutch manuscript on paper of Thomas à Kempis. One of them represents St. John holding a chalice (Fig. 5), the other St. Barbara standing beside her tower (Fig. 6). Goldschmidt (no. 210) describes a St. John panel from Antwerp which is similar, though slightly larger in each direction. This difference may perhaps be explained by the differing amount of shrinkage in the leathers. Mr. Good-hart's manuscript is from the fine old collection of Sir Thomas Phillipps of Middlehill, near Cheltenham. Turning now to the earliest form of decoration in blind in general use, the single stamp, the two examples which follow have come from the Henry E. Huntington Library in San Marino, California. A small quarto printed in Cologne by Ulrich Zell 7 shows in a lozenge Adam and Eve, the tree and the serpent between them, Eve holding the fatal apple in her left hand (Fig. 7). Adam and Eve stamps of other shapes have been illustrated, but not this lozenge, so far as discovered. The book once belonged to the Praemonstratensians in Ratisbon. A curious lozenge which may possibly be meant for Eve is on a Strassburg folio of about 1481. 8 It is impressed upon a reddish brown binding whose wide center panel is crossed by diagonal fillets, the resulting spaces filled by this tool. Comparison with some of Cranach's work has suggested to at least three iconographers that this is intended for Eve (Fig. 8). New Testament subjects are much more numerous than those from the Old, and the Annunciation is a favorite theme of the small stamps as well as the panels. It appears on the binding of a Huntington Library quarto printed in Strassburg in 1487 9 and inscribed "Ad Bibliothecam ffrm Min. convent. ad S:Salvatorem Ratisbonae." On each cover is a narrow strip made up of five impressions of two different rectangular stamps, one an Annunciation (Fig. 9), the other two mythical birds. The Adoration of the Magi is found not infrequently upon panels, but it is a complicated design, and is much less common as a small single stamp. Weale-Taylor describes but does not illustrate an octagonal stamp (Fig. 10), evidently the same as the one which appears upon another Huntington Library binding, covering a folio imprint of Ulrich Zell 10 and once the property of the monastery of St. Ludgarde in Werden on the Ruhr. A delicate square stamp of the same theme (Fig. 11) is on a Latin Bible, printed by Rusch of Strassburg in 1480. It now belongs to the Library of Congress, and was formerly in the library of the Canons Regular of the Holy Cross in Cologne. The subject was particularly popular in that city, for the bones of the Three Kings are believed to rest there. This tool has been described, but not illustrated, by Ilse Schunke in her work on Cologne bindings referred to above (p. 360). As for representations of the saints, Catherine of Alexandria with her wheel is often found. The John Boyd Thacher Collection of the Library of Congress has a quarto printed by Froben in Basel in 1496, 11 bound in lightish brown calf over deeply bevelled boards, the center filled with a floral diaper. Of several small stamps, the significant ones are in the upper and lower borders of the upper cover. One is a large rectangle containing a full-length figure of St. Catherine (Fig. 12), the other a small circle with the initial A, or possibly monogram TA, with small letters tentatively read as w and p on either side. There are no inscriptions to help in assigning provenance, but the small letters suggest the bindings from the Dominican monastery in Vienna identified by the initials W P W (Wienenses Praedicatores), illustrated by Goldschmidt (no. 9). Many other stamps representing saints are in the rich collections of the Huntington Library, among them the three following examples. A delicate little octagon contains St. George and the Dragon (Fig. 13) upon a folio in rough calf printed by Koelhoff in Cologne in 1474. 12 Unfortunately the book is not in good condition and there are no inscriptions or other marks of provenance. There are panels representing St. George, but rarely does he appear on single tools. A folio printed in Venice in 1472 by the famous Jenson 13 has found its way into a German pigskin binding which belonged in the 18th century, at least, to the library of the bishopric of Eichstadt in Bavaria. Its interest lies in the rectangular stamp of St. Sebastian (Fig. 14), accompanied by circular stamps of the Annunciation, the Virgin and Child within a glory, a lion rampant, and a lozenge of the Paschal lamb. Whether saint or Virgin, a stamp which has led to considerable research is on an incunable in the Houghton Library at Harvard (Albertus Magnus, Opus in Evangelium , Strassburg, Mentelin, ca1474). This pigskin folio once belonged to the aforementioned Dominican monastery in Vienna, as attested by an inscription (Conventus Viennensis ordinis FF Praedicatorum) and the characteristic stamps of this bindery, an open crown between the initials P and W. It came eventually into the possession of James Russell Lowell who gave it to the Harvard Library. There is a variety of familiar stamps including the Virgin and Child and the Holy Face, but the one which is a puzzle contains in a circle a halo-ed female figure, leading by her left hand a very recognizable devil (Fig. 15). His horns show plainly and he walks on his two feet as his right arm is held by the saint. At her right is a figure interpreted as a church by several medievalists who have been consulted. Now this identical stamp of which there is a poor impression on a brown sheepskin folio in the British Museum (I.C.5887: Biblia Germanica , Augsburg, 1480) has been called by the abovementioned distinguished writer on bindings, Cyril Davenport, 14 "the Temptation," and it would be easy to leave it at that. But the form of the garment and the suggestion of flowing hair over the shoulders force the conclusion that the central figure is feminine, and not intended to represent Christ. Where does this lead us? One looks for legends of the Virgin and the devil, and finds that the Theophilus story might with a stretch of the imagination apply. Briefly cited, this 6th-century Cilician churchman, an early prototype of Dr. Faustus, sold his soul to the devil, but his contract was retrieved by the Virgin and publicly burned. The small figure balancing the devil might then be intended for the church of which Theophilus refused to become the bishop. There are several representations of this legend in stained glass and sculpture, for instance a bas-relief at Notre Dame in Paris, but they show little resemblance to this stamp. Unconvinced by this interpretation, we seek among the legends of women saints and the devil, and one expert in iconography suggests St. Dymphna, represented in art with a fettered devil at her feet or leading a devil bound. She is an obscure 7th-century saint venerated at Gheel, near Antwerp, whither she fled from Ireland. Her father pursued her, however, with his immoral advances, and murdered her, and on this spot a church was erected in her memory. At this shrine lunatics and those possessed of devils were miraculously cured. Another woman saint who disciplined the devil was Juliana, who held him by a rope around his neck and scourged him, but this attribution seems less adequate, so let us call her St. Dymphna, until a better suggestion is made. The impression on the binding in the British Museum is very indistinct, as the writer can testify, and fails to show the two-piece garment. This is a pity, for one would otherwise gladly accept any identification made by Davenport. Tools of religious symbols were very common—the pelican in her piety, the lion, unicorn and numerous others. One which is new to the writer is a hand raised in benediction (Fig. 16). It is one of several small circular and oval stamps on the white pigskin binding of a folio Bible printed by Richel in Basel no later than 1474, and belonging like so many of our other examples to the Huntington Library. The covers are divided by triple fillets into small compartments, each of which contains a single stamp. Other designs are an acorn, and the gothic letters 'eps' (with a tie above), i.e. episcopus. Inscriptions indicate continuous German ownership—Liber Campidonensis, i.e. from the Benedictine establishment at Kempten in Bavaria, and several private owners including the German collector Vollbehr whose incunabula, among them the Gutenberg Bible, were bought by the Library of Congress in 1930. Another example from the Huntington Library is a single impression of a strange rectangular tool showing a figure with arms upraised, probably an orant (Fig. 17). It is on the binding of a Basel imprint of about 1477. 15 Fifteenth-century inscriptions show that it belonged to the monastery of Mount Calvary near Emmerich, and a later stamp reads: Bibl. Publ. Basiliensi. The design of the binding is simple, with only two stamps besides the Sacred Monogram and the orant. There is a great variety of designs with religious initials or legends or scrolls. A charming 14th-century Book of Hours at the Walters Gallery (W293) has within a small square the gothic initials 'IM', standing presumably for Ihesu Maria, and beside them is a graceful flower which may be the lily, symbol of the Virgin (Fig. 18). The stamps are arranged in columns as is usual in French bindings, and among them are two forms of fleur-de-lis and a paschal lamb. The Huntington Library has two Basel-printed folios which once belonged to the Priory of St. Maynulf, Boddiken, Westphalia, and were probably bound there. Both have the familiar distinctive label in gothic letters 'maynulf9' as well as 'ihesus' and 'maria'. One of them 16 adds the label 'iohēs bapt' (Fig. 19) while the other 17 has in the center of its upper cover a large lozenge with a halo-ed figure holding a church in his right hand. The impression is too indistinct to reproduce, but a good imagination aided by description of the attributes of St. Maynulf is able to detect the antlers of a stag lying beside him. Weale-Taylor (131) describes the labels but does not illustrate them. Many other examples of monastic ownership marks have been found in this study, stamps representing both patron saints and names of monasteries, as for instance the gothic labels 'berchem', an establishment in the province of Antwerp, and 'codex sancti maximi', i.e. of Treves. Illustrations of numerous stamps of this type are available in Goldschmidt and other authorities. There is a special point about our example of this St. Maximin binding, whose ownership is marked not only by the label but also by two inscriptions. This is the use, only once, of a tool showing a two-handled basket tipped so that its contents of fruit or possibly eggs are clearly visible. The binding is on a quarto printed by Koberger of Nuremberg in 1494 18 and belongs to the Library of Congress. On the upper cover are large circular stamps of the Evangelists. The lower cover is centered by a floral diaper from which the basket hangs, and there are also two circular stamps, one of a conventional rose, the other containing a small shield within a vine-like border, very indistinct (Fig. 20). A second example of the basket stamp appears on a photostat from Mr. Hobson, with the information that it is on a book printed in Strassburg in 1486. 19 The photostat shows only one impression of the basket, but there are nineteen other stamps of various shapes and sizes (Fig. 21), none of which except the basket are on the St. Maximin binding discussed above. A third instance of this mysterious little stamp is on the binding of a Strassburg imprint dated c. 1484-87 20 belonging to the Huntington Library, without marks of provenance, unfortunately. In addition to the basket used twice on each cover, it has the same large circular stamps of the Evangelists found on the St. Maximin binding, and the same stamps of the paschal lamb, a star and a floweret as on our second example, which seems to establish a relation between them. Goldschmidt (no. 31) discusses a binding from the workshop of St. Maximin with a stamp showing the arms of the abbey. Though lacking the basket stamp, it has presumably at least three in common with our second example, the photostat. But without illustrations one cannot be sure, for the same sorts of conventional tools were the property of many different binders. Nor can we reconcile the small shield in our first example with the arms of the abbey which he describes. So here is one more question to await further evidence. But the little basket used so sparingly, as if for identification rather than for decoration, is enough to pique one's curiosity, even though it cannot claim to have religious significance, and it would be a satisfaction if one could prove it a distinctive mark of St. Maximin. It is hoped that these notes may show that in the field of blind-stamped bindings there is a great deal not only of iconographic interest, but also a chance for real research. For instance, the relation of designs in the single stamps to those found in other minor arts is obvious to an alert observer in Gothic churches who sees in the small sculptured details and the wood carving similar themes and shapes. And as has been suggested, a study of the origin of certain panels leads back to contemporary woodcuts and engravings. An encouraging aspect of the study of this kind of binding is that any library which possesses books old enough to have been bound prior to about 1550 has great possibilities—provided they have not been tampered with—which have hardly been tapped in this country, and the fact that so few students have investigated this rather unspectacular type shows that it is an uncrowded field here. The amateur must realize, however, that though there are excellent basic discussions in the books already mentioned, every binding is a problem in itself, and except by a very slim chance no two are alike, so there is enough for him to work out for himself. To paraphrase the close of our Colophon article, one really should be an expert in ecclesiastical history and hagiography, in the history of the period in which the bindings were made, in iconography, in paleography for the deciphering of gothic lettering on binding stamps and of inscriptions of ownership, both often abbreviated almost beyond recognition. But even lacking these high qualifications, he can enjoy his new discoveries, as the writer can testify, and be grateful to anyone who sets him right, both as to their novelty or lack of it, and as to his own interpretations.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Printing by the Cambridge Press of A Platform of Church Discipline, 1649 * by Lawrence G. Starkey</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A PLATFORM OF CHURCH DISCIPLINE, A quarto printed by the Cambridge, Massachusetts, Press in 1649, is important to religious historians as the foundation of New England Congregationalism. As such this book has been widely reprinted, both here and in England: Holmes describes twenty-six editions and three reissues from 1649 to 1893. 1 To bibliographers, the first edition of the Platform is important as the first extant work of Samuel Green, third Cambridge printer, 2 who operated the Press from 1649 until it ceased to print in 1692. The Platform also presents a number of interesting bibliographical problems, which have long been unsolved. The purpose of this paper is to clear up several such points about the printing of this book. There has been no agreement about the dating of the Platform . Roden wrote that it was issued "in the late summer of 1649," 3 but Winship believes that it was printed after 19 October 1649, 4 at which date the following entry was made in the minutes of the Massachusetts General Court: Whereas a booke hath binn psented to the Courte, intituled a Platforme of Church Discipline, gathered out of the Word of God, &amp;c, being the result of what the synod did in their assembly in the yere 1647 at Cambridge, for their consideracõn and acceptance, the Court judgeth it meete to comend it to the judicyous and pious consideracõn of the seuerall churches wthin this jurisdiccõn. . . . 5 I feel, however, that the book was printed before the autumn meeting of the General Court and that the wording of the entry in the Court records was copied from the printed title-page. Furthermore, on 17 December 1649 a London printer entered the title in the Stationers' Register ; thus either a book or a manuscript had been dispatched to England before the General Court met. 6 Since crossings from New to Old England in less than two months were unknown at that time, a copy of the Platform printed after the General Court meeting could not have reached England by 17 December. The only reason for delaying the printing of the book until the Court met would have been to make certain of the recommendation of the General Court; if an actual approval had been necessary, however, it is unlikely that an unapproved manuscript would have been sent to England. The evidence, I believe, while it is admittedly inconclusive, points to the Platform having been in print before 19 October 1649. The Court, as a consequence, was not ordering the manuscript to be printed, but instead simply recommending a book already in existence. The language of the Court entry seems to bear out this hypothesis. Further information about the printing of the first edition of the Cambridge Platform is found in what may be called the first bibliographical document in the history of printing in English North America: a list compiled in 1656 by Stephen Daye and Samuel Green of printing done at Cambridge until approximately 1654, with some sketchy data about receipts from sales, printing costs, and quantities of paper used. 7 This document has been well-studied by Winship. 8 As we might expect, the data about the Platform was the first entry made by Green: Sinod booke. he [Dunster] had of Bro: Green 12:00:00 finding papr. for ye impression abate for paper. 6 Rheame ¼ 02:05:00 ------------------- -------- Rest. -09.15.00 09:15:00 At the end of Green's part of the list, the £9 15s was added in as Dunster's profit. For the impression the latter supplied paper which Green appraised as worth £2 5s. Apparently Green did the printing, sold the copies to one or more booksellers, 9 took out enough money to pay himself for his labor, 10 then delivered the rest, £12, to Dunster. This procedure differed from that in effect both before and after the printing of the Platform ; for every other book listed by Daye and Green, the printer was credited with a specified sum as his payment. Since the Platform is a book of five and one-half sheets, the six and one-quarter reams of paper would have been sufficient for an edition of 568, which probably may be reduced to about 550 copies because of waste and imperfect sheets. 11 The title-page of the Platform , which exists in two states, is overcrowded, as in most books printed by the Cambridge Press. It contains twenty-two lines of type (compared with thirty-eight in the text) and gives not only the title and imprint but also the circumstances of the book's preparation and three scriptural quotations.

D4 v is blank. The preface has a running-title, 'The Preface.' ( π A2 v -6 v ); there are no uniform running-titles for the text, but abbreviated chapter-titles are used as hdls., A1 v -D3. When one chapter ends and another begins on the same page, the two chapter-titles are abbreviated and combined as the hdl. for that page. The type is predominantly roman, with some italic; the text has side-notes in roman referring to the Bible by book, chapter, and verse; (D1) 38 ll. 155(164) x 98(114) mm., 82R. The same type had been first used by the Cambridge Press in 1645 for printing John Winthrop's A Declaration of Former Passages and Proceedings Betwixt the English and the Narrow-gansets . Catchwords were used, but in a manner which emphasized the inexperience of the printer. They were seldom set over to the page margin, and there was little or no effort to make catchword capitalization agree with the first word on the succeeding page. Whenever syllables were used as catchwords, the compositor omitted the usual hyphen. I have examined seven of the nine extant copies, as follows: University of Virginia , 175 x 130; New York Public Library (lacks D4), 181 x 132; Congregational Library , 171 x 127; American Antiquarian Society , 180 x 138; Huntington (microfilm); William Clements (microfilm); John Carter Brown (title has been cut out close to frame and mounted for binding), 177 x 131. In addition, I have received a detailed report on an eighth copy: Thomas W. Streeter , 178 x 132. There is a ninth copy in a private library which I have not seen. 12 Of the eight copies upon which this study is based, two have an imprint which reads: [ I ] Printed at Cambridge by S G in New England | and are to be fold at Cambridge and Boston | Anno Dom: 1649. In the other six copies, the first line of the imprint has been altered: 13 [ II ] Printed by S G at Cambridge in New England | and are to be fold at Cambridge and Boston | Anno Dom: 1649. There is good evidence for reversing the order of imprints favored by Winship, who believes that imprint II was first through the press. 14 Associated with imprint I is an error in a scriptural quotation: in the quotation from the 84th Psalm, ' How amiable are thy Tabernacles O Lord of Hosts? ', the final ' s ' in ' Tabernacles ' is lacking in the Brown and Streeter copies, which have imprint I . This quotation is found in a correct state in all copies which have imprint II , thus suggesting that the correction and the change of imprint were made at the same time. An examination of the seventh word in the third line of π A6 v , which is in the same forme as the title-page, provides additional evidence. In the Brown and Streeter copies, with imprint I , the word is printed incorrectly as ' im ', but in all copies with imprint II the word has been press-corrected to ' in '. From this previously unrecorded evidence, I conclude that the letter was changed when the forme was unlocked to alter imprint I to imprint II . Although I believe that these two instances are sufficient to prove the priority of imprint I , I feel bound to mention that the two states of the title-page are characterized by three other differences. With imprint I are found 'Eighth moneth' instead of 'Eight moneth', '84.' instead of '84' (no period), and a swash ' G ' in ' GATHERED ' instead of a plain italic ' G '. The presence or absence of the swash ' G ' is not substantively significant, but the other two differences are manifestly more correct in state I of the titlepage than in state II . Since there is no question of textual alteration connected with them, I would contend that the 'h' in 'Eighth' and the period after '84.' were pulled out when the loosened forme was inked after it had been unlocked to change imprint I to imprint II and to correct the misprint in the scriptural quotation. 14a On the contrary, there is no space for an ' s ' in ' Tabernacle ' when the letter is missing, which suggests that the letter was not pulled out in inking but was instead added as a result of press-correction. There is some additional, though inconclusive, evidence that imprint I was actually first through the press. The separation of town and region in I is awkward. Winship maintains that an imprint would usually begin with the place, which is one of his reasons for regarding imprint I as a revised version. 15 If this reason were valid, one would expect to find Green henceforth setting his imprints with the place first. For the next seven years, however, he invariably set his name first and the place second. Only when, eleven years later, he became associated with Marmaduke Johnson, an experienced London printer, did Green habitually adopt the more conventional sequence in his imprints. 16 Winship's other argument for the priority of imprint II is that it is found in the same copies as a misprint on i A6 recto, whereas imprint I appears in a copy where the misprint has been corrected. He points out that the leaf with the misprint is "the leaf that is joined to that of the title whether the half-sheet of this fold [ i.e. , gathering] was folded outside or inside the other four leaves." 17 Actually, this argument would have no bibliographical validity whatsoever for the second of Winship's postulates: if the half-sheet in the quarto (6's) gathering is the inmost fold and the first, second, fifth, and sixth leaves constitute the full sheet, the title on i A1 r cannot be in the same forme as the misprint on i A6 r , and thus no connection can exist between them. On the other hand, if it is possible to demonstrate what Winship felt was 'futile to guess,' that is, that the half-sheet is the outermost fold i A1.6, then since all four type-pages of the two leaves could have been imposed in the same forme—provided the fold were printed by half-sheet imposition, —any argument based on a relation between the misprint and the title must be scrutinized carefully. The problem, therefore, must be attacked from two points of enquiry: (1) which fold in the six-leaf preliminary gathering was printed as a half-sheet; and (2) if this fold was i A1.6, was it printed by half-sheet imposition (the only method which could bring the type-pages for i A1 r and i A6 r together in the same forme) or in some other manner which would separate them by formes. (1) Following the title-leaf, the first gathering of the Platform continues with a ten-page preface, the whole quarto gathering being composed of six leaves and thus necessitating the first use of a half-sheet by a Cambridge printer. This poses to the bibliographer the nice problem whether Green quired the half-sheet within the folded full sheet as would have been normal printing practice, or whether he printed the title on it and wrapped it around the full sheet. Although the problem has been thought insoluble, 18 watermarks conveniently provide the answer. By good fortune in the copy held by the American Antiquarian Society (the other copies are ambiguous 18a ), the watermarks link i A1 with i A6, and i A2 with i A5. Thus i A3.4, the inner fold, cannot be the half-sheet, for that would mean that each of the quarto leaves of a full sheet i A1.2.5.6 would have a watermark:an impossibility. The only conclusion is that i A1.6, the fold containing the title-page and the end of the preface, must be the half-sheet. (2) Having established that the outer fold is the half-sheet, we may now turn to the question of its printing, for a bibliographical connection can exist between i A1 r and i A6 r only if the fold were printed by half-sheet imposition, that is, by placing all type-pages in one forme, with printing and perfecting of a full sheet being made from this forme and the halves of the full sheet subsequently being cut apart to furnish two identical copies of the half-sheet. First, however, it is necessary to examine what are the actual facts of coincidence between this i A6 r misprint and its correction 19 in relation to the two states of the title. Winship's facts are in error here, for the misprint on i A6 r is not, as he states, corrected in copies with imprint I though uncorrected in all copies with imprint II . Instead, this misprint appears in one of the preserved copies with imprint I (John Carter Brown) and is also found in two copies with imprint II (University of Virginia and Huntington) although corrected in the other four copies with imprint II which I have examined and also in the Streeter copy with imprint I . This evidence puts a quite different complexion on the problem, for it demonstrates (a) the misprint was not corrected at the same time as the alteration in the title; (b) imprint I must have been first through the press. Determination of the precise method of printing thus becomes doubly necessary if we are to untangle the proper explanation for these facts. Had i A1.6 been printed by half-sheet imposition, the type-pages must necessarily have been imposed in a single forme in the following relation to each other: If we begin normal printing from this forme and lay each successive piece of paper, printed on one side only, on a pile, we should start with imprint I of the title, the misprint on i A6 r , and the misprint on i A6 v . The series of sheets printed with this state of the type we may call series X. As the second step in the printing, the press is stopped, the title is altered to imprint II , and coincidentally the misprint on i A6 v is corrected. A second series of sheets, series Y, is thereupon printed on one side only with these characteristics and laid on top of series X in the gradually mounting heap of wrought-off sheets. Somewhat later the misprint on i A6 r is detected, and the press is stopped to make this correction. 19a The remaining sheets, series Z, are thereupon printed and laid on the pile in order. To complete the process this whole pile is turned over so that series X is on top, and perfecting is executed, all three series being perfected by the forme in state Z. When this operation is followed, and the full sheets cut in half to give us the i A1.6 folds, we observe that we have secured a proportion of states which closely approximates those in the extant copies. The largest number of half-sheets contains imprint II and the corrected readings on i A6 r and i A6 v . A smaller number gives us the state of the Virginia and Huntington copies, with imprint II , i A6 v corrected, but i A6 r uncorrected. Finally, we have the smallest group, containing imprint I , i A6 v uncorrected, but i A6 r corrected —that is, the Streeter copy. It is clear, therefore, that if printing proceeded by half-sheet imposition as outlined above, no copy could be produced which would correspond with the John Carter Brown copy with imprint I , although in all other respects we have variants corresponding with the other known copies and in approximately the correct proportions. There is, however, another alternative. 20 If the correction of the misprint in i A6 r did not take place during the printing of the white-paper but instead was performed during the operation of perfecting, then if all of series X and a certain number of series Y (there would be no series Z of white-paper) had been perfected with the forme in the Y state and the press were stopped to correct i A6 r (constituting state Z) during the early perfecting of the Y sheets, we should indeed have copies produced which agree exclusively with the John Carter Brown exemplum and the two known states of imprint II , but none at all of the state represented by the Streeter copy with imprint I . For these reasons, it is necessary to enquire whether another method of printing might not have been adopted which would produce copies in the states observed and in proportion to their preservation. This method is to be found in printing by cut sheets. According to this rather elementary procedure, familiar in the earliest days of printing, the full sheets were cut in half before any were printed, and thereupon each half-sheet was treated as a separate sheet, being printed from one forme and perfected from a different forme (inner and outer). If this method were employed for the half-sheet in the Platform , the inner and outer formes would each have been made up from only two type-pages, as follows: Whether the inner or the outer forme was first through the press is undeterminable and here of no consequence, since under any circumstances uncorrected printed white-paper is perfected by an uncorrected forme at the start and the overlap—as represented by the Virginia and Huntington copies—occurs according to the unequal proportion of each machined as a separate operation. Although printing by cut sheets is a primitive method as compared with half-sheet imposition, there is every indication from his work that Green was not a sophisticated workman and that he may well have prided himself on successfully solving the problem he faced, especially if—as likely—he had never been instructed in the technique of half-sheet imposition. If we believe that i A1.6 was indeed printed by cut sheets, we are enabled to explain without difficulty the particular proportion of extant copies in each state, a matter impossible to explain by any theory of half-sheet imposition. Moreover, the difference in time between the correction of misprints on i A6 r and i A6 v is more readily accounted for if they are in different formes than if we must assume in half-sheet imposition that two separate correction operations were made in the same forme. By cut-sheet printing only a relatively few copies of the inner forme need have been printed before the correction on i A6 r was effected, and, indeed, this is the direct import of the evidence of the Streeter copy. The central bibliographical fact with which we are concerned is clear. Printing was by cut sheets; moreover, imprint I must have been first through the press, and the alteration of this state to the form of imprint II has no causal connection with the correction of the misprint on i A6 r as has been asserted. The two type-pages were in different formes, and hence alterations to these pages are from a bibliographical point of view completely independent even though the leaves are conjoined. Commencing with i A2, and continuing with the subsequent gatherings in 4's, the recto of every leaf in the Platform bears a signature, instead of the two, or at most three, leaves customarily signed in a quarto gathering, all that are necessary for a binder. Green seems to have devised his own method of signing, using letters exclusively. The rectos of each gathering were signed with a combination of capital and lower case letters, for example: B, Bb, Bbb, Bbbb. The letter of the alphabet denoted the gathering, the number of letters, including the capital, the leaf. In the four gatherings of the text of the Platform , this system is worked out perfectly; but in the preface, printed last of all, there is some confusion, doubtless because of the quiring of the i A gathering as a quarto in 6's. The rectos of the preliminary gathering are signed in succession after the title page: Aa, Aaa, Aaa, Aaaa, Aa5. The last leaf, signed Aa5, was, of course, i A6; apparently Aa5 was intended as an abbreviation for Aaaaaa, i.e. capital A and five lower-case a's. The fourth and fifth leaves of the gathering were incorrectly signed Aaa and Aaaa. The error was natural, for Green had only to forget for a moment that he was later to have a half-sheet; the two leaves in question would be correctly signed as the last two leaves of a quarto gathering like the others in the same book. Green abandoned this system of signing after printing the Platform , and similar signatures are never again found in the books printed by the Cambridge Press. The list of nine errata found on D4 r (of the inner forme) is unable, because of its position, to correct any errors on D1 v , D2 r (D3 v is blank), or in the table of contents on the errata leaf itself, where two chapters are listed as beginning on the wrong pages. 21 That an erratum is listed for D1 r proves that the outer forme of the D gathering was first through the press. Since the list of errata corrects none of the several errors in the preface, either, we may readily assume that the i A 6 was printed last, as would be expected. The designation of the errata as ' faults escaped in some of the books thus amended ' seems to indicate that corrections had been made in the text by stopping the press, and that one might expect to find the correct readings in some copies. A collation of eight of the nine extant copies, however, discloses that none of the errata was corrected. Because we have less than two per cent of the edition, it is impossible to tell whether corrections were actually made or whether Green was trying consciously to give the impression that he was a much more careful printer than actually he was. We know that later, while printing the preface, he did stop his press to correct errors in the half-sheet. He seems, however, to have paid no attention to several errors in the full sheet ( i A2-5) of the preface, including one that was particularly noticeable: the misspelling of 'Preface' as 'Prefae' in the headline on i A4 r .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 0 * Editor's note: After galley proof had been returned and was in process of paging, Dr. Starkey was so fortunate as to secure information on an eighth copy of the Platform by courtesy of its owner, Mr. Thomas W. Streeter. Although no new variants occur in this copy, some are found in combinations which differ from those in the other seven copies examined. The new evidence thus furnished serves powerfully to confirm Dr. Starkey's original conclusions arrived at, in small part, by another line of bibliographical reasoning which had, although less certainly, disproved the case for half-sheet imposition in the preliminary gathering. It has seemed advisable, therefore, to utilize to the full the evidence of the Streeter copy in a more direct manner than by appending an addendum paragraph. Because of the advanced state of the proof, all necessary mention could not be made in the text proper, although some was possible. For this reason, a certain number of supplementary footnotes have been constructed on evidence communicated by Dr. Starkey to serve as a running commentary to equate the Streeter copy with the discussion in the text of the seven copies which Dr. Starkey had personally examined as a basis for the present article. 1 Thomas J. Holmes, The Minor Mathers, A List of Their Works (Cambridge, Mass., 1940), pp. 68-81. 2 Stephen Daye is generally credited with being the first Cambridge printer and with having printed The Whole Booke of Psalmes (Bay Psalm Book) in 1640. Certainly Stephen had some connection with the early Cambridge Press, although there is some doubt that he was ever its compositor: extant letters written by him contain spellings which, even by seventeenth-century standards, indicate that he was hardly more than semi-literate. Stephen's son Matthew was Green's immediate predecessor as Cambridge printer. Matthew's name appears in the imprint of the Almanack for 1647 (published before March, 1647), and he may have done the printing for a number of years before that time, in addition to his work as Steward of Harvard College. He died on 10 May 1649. 3 Robert F. Roden, The Cambridge Press , 1638-1692 (New York, 1905), p. 53. 4 George Parker Winship, The Cambridge Press , 1638-1692 (Philadelphia, 1945), p. 113. In the same place Winship states that on 19 October 1649 the General Court called for an edition of 500 copies of the Platform . I have been unable to find any evidence to support this, or that the book was printed at public expense. 5 Records of the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England , ed. by Nathaniel B. Shurtleff (Boston, 1853), III, 177-78. 6 The book was entered by Hannah Allen, widow of a London printer who had in 1643 reprinted the lost Cambridge Press broadside of the Capitall Lawes of 1642. What has not hitherto been commented upon is that the well-known London printer, Lodowick Lloyd, soon after entered the same book in the Register on 28 December 1649. Lloyd's entry was deleted, however, probably when the duplication was noted. It seems very unlikely that two manuscripts would have found their way to London within a few days of each other, whereas there is good reason to believe that many copies of each book printed by the Cambridge Press were sent to England. Furthermore, it would have been most unlikely that a ship would have been leaving for England as late as two weeks or so after the 19th of October; the last ship of the year to England usually sailed before the end of September in order to avoid the winter storms. 7 Daye and Green used this list as the basis for a joint affidavit they rendered to the Middlesex County Court at Cambridge, in a suit brought in 1656 by John Glover, eldest son and heir of the Reverend Jose Glover (who had died at sea in 1638 while bringing the first press to Cambridge), against his step-father, Henry Dunster, first President of Harvard, who had received the profits of the Press until he resigned as President in 1654. The list is in two parts on one sheet, one part compiled by Daye and the other by Green. 8 George Parker Winship, "A Document Concerning the First Anglo-American Press," The Library , 4th ser., XX (1940), 51-70, transcribed the document and also printed a facsimile. The original is now among the Dunster mss. in the Harvard University Archives. 9 Only one bookseller is known to have been active in Boston at this time, Hezekiah Usher, who had sold the Almanack for 1647 and the Book of the General Lawes (1648). Two years later in 1651, the Psalmes , the revised version of the Bay Psalm Book, were sold to three booksellers, including Usher. 10 Three years later, Green charged £9 to print a 7½-sheet quarto, Richard Mather's Summe of Certain Sermons (1652). At this rate, he would have charged about £6 10S to print the Platform . 11 If the book were printed in an edition of about 550 copies, the books would have been sold to the bookseller for about 8d a copy, or slightly in excess of the penny-a-sheet figure usually charged in England. 12 Winship's Preliminary Check List of Cambridge , Massachusetts Imprints , 1638-1692 (Boston, 1939), p. 4, lists nine extant copies of the Platform , but it omits the copy in the John H. Scheide Library and erroneously includes one in the Boston Public Library. 13 Winship has confused the two imprints in his Cambridge Press , p. 113. He lists II as found only in the copy in the John Carter Brown Library and another copy in a private library. Actually II is found in the six copies I have seen other than those in the library of Mr. Thomas W. Streeter and in the John Carter Brown Library, which exhibit state I . I have not been able to examine the Scheide copy. In his earlier Check List , p. 4, Winship also confused the description of this book by listing II as found only in the Huntington copy and I in all others. 14 Cambridge Press , p. 113. 14a The evidence of the Streeter copy of imprint I , in which no period exists after '84' contrasts with the printing of a period in the John Carter Brown imprint I copy to demonstrate the correctness of Dr. Starkey's hypothesis that these particular variants were caused by pulled types during the course of the printing. Clearly, the forme in the Streeter copy of imprint I which preserves the 'h' in 'Eighth' but has lost the period after '84' was later through the press than the forme in the John Carter Brown copy of imprint I , which contains the period as well as the 'h'. The Streeter sheet, therefore, serves as a bridge to copies with imprint II , in which the 'h' has also been pulled. The only modification necessary in the argument is the fact that the type began to loosen earlier than Dr. Starkey originally inferred. In other respects the Streeter title is identical with that of the Brown copy: a plain italic ' G ' is found in ' GATHERED ', and no ' s ' appears after ' Tabernacle '. Editor . 15 Winship advances the theory ( Cambridge Press , p. 113) that someone called Green's attention to a deviation from standard printing practice, ( i.e. his failure to put the place first in the imprint) while the forme was still on the press, and that the press was stopped to allow a revision to the more customary form of the imprint. Actually the change would have been to a form of imprint which Green never used, i.e. placing his name between the town and region. In my opinion, a more likely explanation is that Green saw for himself, or had called to his attention, the extreme awkwardness of imprint I and stopped his press to revise it to imprint II , which, from then on, remained the form of imprint he used most frequently as long as he was printing unassisted. 16 That English printers usually placed the city first in their imprints is undeniable. Nevertheless, the conventional seventeenth-century English imprint: 'London. Printed by . . .', is not really a parallel to imprint I . Both states of the imprint in the Platform are deviations from normal London imprint phraseology. From 1656 to 1660 Green used the conventional English imprint four times and at the same time used in other books the form of imprint II ; he is not known ever to have used the form of imprint I except in the Platform . 17 Cambridge Press , p. 113. 18 Winship ( Cambridge Press , p. 114) wrote: "Opinions differ whether a make-up man with or without experience would be more likely to put the title or the inside four pages on a half-sheet, and with other evidence showing that the printer of this tract was unfamiliar with routine practice, it is futile to guess." 18a This remark may now be supplemented. The single watermark in the Streeter copy is divided between the third and fourth leaves, a position which also demonstrates the case. Dr. Starkey has, in addition, received information that the two watermarks in the New York Public Library copy conform in position to those in the copy held by the Antiquarian Society. Editor . 19 The misprint is ' crntrbute ', corrected to ' contribute '. Winship lists the error as ' crntrilute ' only partially corrected to ' contrilute '. None of the eight copies examined agrees with this description. 19a Dr. Starkey observes that the precise relationship in point of time of this correction in 6 recto to the correction of the misprint 'im' on 6 verso and the alteration of the imprint is not certain, but that the suggested order gives a proportion of copies roughly approximating those which are preserved in each state. If, on the other hand, the misprint on 6 recto had been observed and corrected before the imprint alteration, no other states would have been produced but only more of the Streeter and fewer of the Virginia-Huntington states would have resulted. The point is an academic one, however, since half-sheet imposition proves to be an impossibility. Editor . 20 Actually, there is still another, consisting of the immediate perfecting of each sheet the moment after it had been printed. No parallel is known to such a procedure since the problem of offset would be insuperable, and hence it may be dismissed as an impossibility without further consideration. 21 Chapters XVI and XVII are listed as beginning on pp. 27 and 28; actually they begin on pp. 26 and 27.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Fees Paid to Authors by Certain American Periodicals, 1840-1850 by J. Albert Robbins</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A RELATIVELY NEW FIELD NOW BEING DEVELOPED by American literary scholars is the economic aspects of authorship. 1 Not until the 1830's and 1840's did magazine publishers offer adequate payment to authors, but even so, the rates were flexible and the pay often uncertain or delayed. The factors, obviously, were the needs of the publisher and the reputation of the writer. In many cases the rate of payment was arrived at by a haggling between buyer and seller. Moreover, not all of the established periodicals could afford adequate payment. In 1838 the Baltimore American Museum had a standard rate of $2 for poetry and $1.50 per page for prose. 2 The Southern Literary Messenger in 1840 could offer Griswold only $1.50 or $2 per page, and this sum only at some future time. 3 The North American Review had a standard rate of only $1 per printed page and Edwin P. Whipple later wrote that in 1845 "some of us who wrote for it at a dollar a page were wont to call it the Mount Auburn of literature, affording a most beautiful mausoleum wherein an article could be buried." 4 It is no cause for wonder that many authors were hard pressed to make a livelihood from their writings. Poe was continually in want of funds. Lowell hoped to earn from his writings only $400 during 1843. 5 In 1842 Longfellow earned $517 from his pen—$315 coming from magazine writings and only $202 from his published volumes. 6 The "popular" writers, however, were often besting the literary geniuses of the day. Henry William Herbert, who was hardly more than a literary hack, averaged from three to four thousand dollars a year translating French novels for the cheap novel trade, 7 and N. P. Willis's extensive popularity brought him great sums. In 1840, Longfellow wrote, "Nat Willis . . . says he has made ten thousand dollars the last year by his writings. I wish I had made ten hundred." 8 George R. Graham's policy of liberal payment and Louis A. Godey's attempt to meet this competition altered the scale of magazine payment drastically. Willis, one of the many who benefited, noted that "The burst on author-land of Graham's and Godey's liberal prices was like a sunrise without a dawn." 9 The situation is well summarized in an article in the New York Weekly Mirror , edited by two Graham's writers, George P. Morris and N. P. Willis: There are several of the magazines that pay for articles, but no one of them, we believe, pays for all its contents. Graham and Godey, (two men of noble liberality to authors,) pay prices to some of their contributors that would far out-bid the highest rates of magazine payment in England. Their prose-writers receive from two to twelve dollars a page, and their poets from five to fifty dollars an article. . . . All the paying magazines and reviews, however, reject fifty articles to one that they accept, and they pay nobody whose "name" would not enrich their table of contents. 10 The prices paid for magazine contributions roughly corresponded to a writer's general popularity and renown. A brief look at the prices which Graham paid Longfellow, Cooper, Lowell, and Poe will illustrate the process which both writer and publisher followed. As Longfellow's account book shows and as Professor Charvat has recently pointed out, 11 Longfellow in 1840 and 1841 received only $15 or $20 per poem from magazines. Park Benjamin, the New York editor and writer, printed Longfellow's "Wreck of the Hesperus" in his New World , January 11, 1840. He paid Longfellow $25 and apparently thought himself liberal in the payment. Graham was determined to buy Longfellow's name for its advertising value, and apparently during 1841 he urged Benjamin to do what he could in the matter. 12 In addition to this, Graham had his editor, Poe, write Longfellow during May, offering carte blanche terms. Longfellow declined from press of other duties. Graham then tried a third alternative. In October, Graham wrote Griswold asking for some way of persuading Longfellow to contribute regularly. At this point, Benjamin came through, for he wrote Graham, asking a question to which he knew the answer: "Would you like to have an occasional poem from Professor Longfellow? I think I could get him to write for you at $20.—He asks $25." Graham hastened to conclude the bargain, and Longfellow's first poem in Graham's appeared in the January, 1842, issue. For it Longfellow received $20, the same sum paid by the New York Ladies' Companion for another of his poems printed the same month. Longfellow apparently liked the conservative format of Graham's and saw a chance for a little regular income from it. At any rate, he wrote Poe late in 1841 about further contributions. Graham answered this letter, offering $30 for a monthly poem or article, provided he write for no other Philadelphia periodical. Longfellow must have felt $30 rather low, for early in 1842 Benjamin—still involved in the negotiations—wrote him that Graham had agreed to $50 "for each article." Later Graham explained that he had in mind $50 for prose and $30 for poetry. The latter figure he thought liberal "as I had purchased at $20"; but he was willing to pay any sum mutually agreeable. Longfellow was firm and for all other contributions Graham paid $50. 13 The wily and money-wise Cooper negotiated directly with Graham, and prudently did even this when he happened to be in Philadelphia on other business. It would be interesting indeed to read a stenographic record of their bargaining. Cooper did very well for himself. He sold a very inferior product ( Autobiography of a Pocket-Handerkerchief ) to Graham for $500. It took up 48 pages, making a per-page rate of $10.40. Later Graham printed Cooper's biographical sketches of naval commanders, for which he paid $1000. They ran to 130 printed pages, a per-page rate of $7.70. Cooper's longest contribution was the Islets of the Gulf , running for 17 installments. It took up 188 pages, a per-page rate of $6.38. 14 Lowell is a convenient illustration of a growing reputation reflected in the rate of magazine payment. In 1842 Graham paid him $10 per poem. It is likely that he paid $20 the following year. In 1844, Graham went up to $25 and $30, and by 1850 Graham was offering Lowell $40 for his "very best" poems and would have paid fifty, but for business troubles. A letter which Graham wrote Longfellow in 1844 indicates Graham's opinion of Lowell's market-value at the time and presents a picture of the problems of a magazine publisher. In regard to Lowell, I told Mr. Peterson to write to him last week, and to offer him $25 per poem. I have already engaged exclusively Bryant, Paulding, Cooper &amp; I hope your self for "Graham" with a host of lesser lights, and the truth is I cannot go beyond a certain mark in general expenses. Lowell's reputation is not as wide-spread as yours or Bryant's, and his poems—to me — are not worth as much. He wrote me some time ago that Godey had offered to take his poems, at the same price I paid, but I feel assured that Mr. Godey will not give him 25 per month for one year , although he may take a single one for the sake of getting his name . 15 In addition to his income as editor, Poe received $4 per printed page from Graham. Poe's income from magazine contributions seldom exceeded five dollars per page. During his lifetime Poe was not universally popular as a writer and he had antagonized innumerable fellow craftsmen and editors. Actually, Graham paid Poe what his reputation was then worth. The "lesser lights," as Graham called them, frequently commanded quite respectable prices for their contributions. The only periodical writer in this period for which I have found a complete account book is Mrs. Emma C. Embury, an amateur female writer and wife of a wealthy Brooklyn banker. Graham paid her as high as $40 per prose tale, and her rate per page ran as high as $7.30. For 133 contributions of prose and poetry between 1837 and 1849, she received $3100, quite a respectable sum for one of the "damned scribbling women" that Hawthorne scorned. 16 For many of the periodical contributors only scattered facts are available. In some cases the figures mentioned are haggling-prices. Yet all data are useful to a student of the economics of authorship. In 1841 Park Benjamin received $10 from Graham for two sonnets. 17 In 1842 Henry T. Tuckerman asked Griswold (then editor of Graham's ) only for "whatever remuneration you can afford for my last contribution." 18 During this year Evert A. Duyckinck attempted to sell a minor writer, William A. Jones, to Graham's . Griswold explained that Mr. Graham offered only $2 a page to minors, reserving high pay for the "'stars' in his stock company." 19 For prose articles in Godey's Lady's Book Seba Smith was receiving $5 per page. 20 Graham paid Epes Sargent, the New York editor and publisher, $20 for a four-page article. 21 In August, 1842, Albert B. Street, a poetically-minded New York lawyer, offered Graham an 875-line narrative poem for $60. 22 The poem was not accepted. The prolific Henry William Herbert received a $5 per page rate for prose printed in Grabam's . For a story, "The Sisters," printed in three installments in 1842, he felt his payment too low. He returned the draft and asked $100 for the piece. 23 The following year Herbert found himself in need of "a little ready money" and offered Graham twelve tales of about eight pages each for $200 cash, at considerable loss. "The price of these tales," he wrote, "would be at the rate M r . G. pays me now $500 &amp; I am willing to sacrifice $300 for the present accomodation." 24 Early in 1843 James Kirke Paulding, a collaborator of Washington Irving and a writer of considerable prominence, wrote Griswold that "I don't like Mr. Cooper's agreement with you, and though having expressed myself willing to be placed on the same footing with him, I am bound to stand to my word, yet I would much prefer the original terms proposed, namely:—ten dollars a page for all contributions, within the compass of five pages, or not exceeding it, and five dollars a page for all over that number." 25 Still another of Graham's contributors was jealous of Cooper's high payment. In the same year Thomas C. Grattan, the British consul at Boston, wrote, accepting Graham's offer of $5 per printed page, "the more so as you tell me M r . Cooper is satisfied with the same." 26 Either Graham or Griswold was guilty of misleading Mr. Grattan on this point. Mrs. Frances Sargent Osgood was one of the period's prominent women contributors. Graham wrote to her in 1843, asking for monthly contributions at $25 per story and $10 per poem. 27 The following year, Charles J. Peterson, the publisher of Peterson's Ladies' National Magazine , stated that his rate of pay to women writers was $2 per printed page for prose and $5 per poem. "This is, perhaps, no remuneration for them, but it is all the publishers here, excepting Graham, give, and all we can afford." He accurately estimated the market-value when he stated that "you &amp; Mrs [Ann S.] Stephens . . . are above all rule." 28 By 1848, Mrs. Osgood was asking $1 for every four lines of poetry and $10 per page for prose. 29 In 1844, just before his European trip, Bayard Taylor raised some of his expense money by contracting with the Saturday Evening Post and the United States Gazette for a series of travel letters. To enlarge his fund he looked up Graham and left a number of poems with him, and later Graham wrote, offering $30 for the lot. 30 The famous "Ik. Marvel" wrote a friend that he didn't "like the idea of writing for such a magazine" as Graham's , but he found the pay "too tempting." Graham paid him $4 per page. 31 The total cost to a publisher such as Graham for literary matter in a single issue is impossible to calculate from the incomplete data available. The highest price he paid any author per monthly issue for his name-value was Cooper. The amount was $125. 32 In a letter written in 1850, Graham claimed that he had paid up to $1085 for the literary matter in a single issue. 33 Three years later he claimed to have spent as high as $1500 per single issue "for authorship alone." 34 In 1852 he boasted that he had paid "over $80,000 to American writers alone" during the first ten years of publication. 35 When one attempts to compare the high prices paid by Godey and Graham with those prices of a later day, he finds it difficult to reduce all the factors to a common level. Certainly, late in the nineteenth century, magazine publishing became big business, with circulations running into the hundreds of thousands. The prices paid to authors did increase, but the living cost also increased. Putnam's Magazine averaged about $7 per page. The better class of literary periodical in the 1870's paid a standard price of $10 a page. 36 Professor Mott has attempted a comparison. Considering differences in money values, Graham's paid a price corresponding to $13 per Putnam page. However, the cost of living had tripled, and to equal Graham's, Putnam's should have paid about $40 per page to meet Graham's payment in 1842. 37 It is illogical to attempt to compare Graham's prices in 1848 with the Saturday Evening Post's prices in 1949. Today the large-circulation magazines can afford $10,000 and more for single articles or stories by world-renowned figures. But for such magazines as the Atlantic and Harper's , the standard rate is around $200 to $250 per article. Against such a pay scale—if one considers cost of living changes—Graham's payments compare favorably indeed. For poetry, Graham paid as much as $50. The best American poets today receive about $200 per poem. Here, again, the comparison is favorable. The 1840's marked a turn in the history of periodical literature. Literary magazines began to reach a large audience. The quality of the literary contents improved. Prices for literary matter increased noticeably and, in some respects, are comparable with current rates. As a result of competition, the principle of literary name-value was established. The top periodicals became national magazines, drawing upon the writing talent of all sections of the country. These changes worked to the advantage of American authors, yet during the 1840's and 1850's no author of first magnitude could earn an adequate livelihood from periodicals alone. By the 1870's and 1880's his prospects were no better. Contributing to magazines could afford a convenient supplement to one's income, but as a sole source of income it was obviously insufficient.</field>

Such studies of literary popularity as Frank Luther Mott's Golden Multitudes are a step in this direction. An extended study is soon to be published by Professor William Charvat of Ohio State University. His book will be the first concentrated attack upon the general problem. 2 Nathan C.

For purposes of comparison it is interesting to note that the young William Dean Howells in 1858 was planning a contribution to the Odd Fellows' Literary Casket . "The Casket pays $2.00 a page," Howells wrote Miss Victoria M. Howells, December 26, 1858 ( Life in Letters of William Dean Howells , ed. by Mildred Howells, New York, 1928, I, 16-17). At this early date Howells had published nothing in book form. 5 Lowell to George B.

Mancur writes that Robert Hamilton, an associate editor of the Ladies' Companion , "some time since, told me Willis drew $1200 per annum from three periodicals." Willis' writing for Graham's , Mancur thinks will raise his income to $1600. Mancur's small income rankles within him. "Now rating my merit to be as compared with Willis' as 6 is to 12 . . . I find myself continually grumbling that I can only earn . . . at the average rate of $23 p month, or 276$ or 280$ p annum, not the fourth of Willis' earnings." (Mancur to R. W.

Poe to Longfellow, May 3, 1841; letter printed in John Ward Ostrom, Letters of Edgar Allan Poe (Cambridge, Mass., 1948), I, 158.

Graham to Longfellow, January 7, 1842; MS in the Longfellow House, Cambridge. Benjamin to Longfellow January 7, 1842; MS letter in the Longfellow House. Graham to Longfellow, January 20, 1842; MS letter in the Longfellow House. Poe figures in this correspondence, for he was editor of Graham's Magazine from March, 1841, to April, 1842. Subsequent correspondence from Graham's contributors is answered by Rufus W. Griswold, who served as editor from May, 1842, to September, 1843. For the negotiation of Longfellow's longest contribution to Graham's Magazine see Law-rance R. Thompson, "Longfellow Sells The Spanish Student ," American Literature , VI (May, 1934), 141-150. 14 These long contributions generally brought a lower per-page rate than short articles. Graham paid Bryant and Dana and N. P. Willis $50 for single prose contributions. One of Willis's, which ran to 4½ pages, figures out at a per-page rate of $11.11. 15 Graham to Longfellow, May 20, 1844; MS letter in the Longfellow House, Cambridge. 16 For details see the present writer's "Mrs. Emma C. Embury's Account Book, A Study of Some of her Periodical Contributions," Bulletin of the New York Public Library , LI (August, 1947), 479-85. 17 Benjamin to Graham, October 26, [1841]; MS letter in Boston Public Library. These were probably the two sonnets of Benjamin which were printed in the January, 1842, issue of Graham's Magazine . 18 Tuckerman to Griswold, October 11, 1842; MS letter in Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Yet, by 1850, Tuckerman was receiving $30 for two articles (Tuckerman to Graham, December 14, 1850; MS letter in Historical Society of Pennsylvania). 19 Griswold to E. A. Duyckinck, June 24, 1842; MS letter in New York Public Library. 20 Mary Alice Wyman, Two American Pioneers: Seba Smith and Elizabeth Oakes Smith (New York, 1927), p. 121. 21 Sargent to Graham, June 7, 1842; MS letter in Boston Public Library. 22 Street to Griswold, August 8, 1842; MS letter in Boston Public Library. The poem was probably "The Burning of Schenectady." It appeared in book form late in 1842. 23 Herbert to Griswold, April 19, 1842; MS letter in Boston Public Library. The story ran to 21 printed pages. At $100, the per-page rate would have been about $4.75. 24 Herbert to Griswold, June 19, 1843; MS letter in Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Herbert was thus willing to accept about $2.10 per page. 25 Paulding to Griswold, January 31, 1843; letter printed in Passages from the Correspondence of . . . Rufus W. Griswold (Cambridge, Mass., 1898), p. 135. 26 Grattan to Griswold, June 6, 1843; MS letter in Boston Public Library. 27 Graham to Osgood, January 8, 1843; MS letter in Boston Public Library. 28 Peterson to Mrs. Osgood, April 10, 1844; MS in Boston Public Library. 29 Mrs. Osgood to John Sartain, December 5, 1848; MS in Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Sartain became the publisher of the Union Magazine in 1849. He was probably lining up his contributors, prior to assuming control of the magazine. 30 Graham to Taylor, June 7, 1844; MS in Cornell University Library. Graham had printed one poem of Taylor's in June, 1843. The poems mentioned in the letter were probably the two printed August and October, 1844, for subsequent poems reflect his European travels. If so, $15 per poem was a good rate of pay for Taylor, who as yet had not achieved high popularity. 31 Donald Grant Mitchell to Mrs. Mary Perkins Goddard, January 17, 1848; letter printed in Waldo H. Dunn, Life of Donald G. Mitchell (New York, 1922), p. 181. 32 This was the monthly cost to Graham of Cooper's Autobiography of a Pocket-Handkerchief . 33 Graham to Bayard Taylor, December 2, 1850; MS letter in Cornell University Library. In this letter, Graham told Taylor that he had spent "$4000 for the engraving-printing and coloring of Jan'y plates." The cost of the January issue would have been heaviest, for Graham always tried to "spread" himself at the beginning of the year, when most subscriptions were renewed. 34 Moreover, Graham claimed, the minimum rate for contributions per issue for years had been $800.—Editorial item, Graham's Magazine , XLIII (November, 1853), 554. 35 Editorial item, Graham's Magazine , XLI (November, 1852), 556. By the following February, this figure had risen to $87,000 (XLII, 222). I have no doubt that Graham is exaggerating. Yet, a cost of only $500 per issue for the first ten years of publication would total $60,000. Graham's competitor, Godey, made an even more absurd exaggeration ( Godey's Lady's Book , XL, [February, 1850], 88). He claimed to have spent $200,000 for contributions. The Lady's Book was then in its twentieth year, and Godey was claiming to have spent an average of $10,000 per year, an utterly absurd claim, considering the type of writers he printed and his general rate of payment. 36 Frank Luther Mott, A History of American Magazines (Cambridge, Mass., 1930-1938), III, 14. 37 Ibid. , p. 15.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Melville and The Shakers by Merton M. Sealts, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO STUDENTS OF HERMAN MELVILLE THE year 1850, when Moby-Dick was taking form, is of especial interest. The book was in progress soon after Melville's return to New York from Europe early in the year, and work on it continued at Pittsfield, where he spent the summer and located on his newly-purchased farm in the autumn. Although he was no stranger to the Berkshires, having lived nearly a year there with his late uncle, Thomas Melvill, and taught school in the neighborhood during his youth, he seems to have made a deliberate effort in 1850 to renew his familiarity with the New England environment through travel and reading. From July 18 to July 20 he accompanied his cousin Robert Melvill on a Berkshire excursion, and in the same month he was reading several books with New England associations— Dwight's Travels in New England , 1 A History of the County of Berkshire , Hawthorne's Mosses from an Old Manse , and an anonymous work on the "United Society of Believers, Commonly Called Shakers," acquired on a visit to the Shaker settlement at Hancock, Massachusetts, on July 21. Melville's copy of this book, A Summary View of the Millenial Church , is now in the Stone Collection in the Alderman Library, the University of Virginia. 2 Although Melville introduced a crazed Shaker sailor into Moby-Dick as the principal character of the interlude entitled "The Jeroboam's Story" (Chapter LXXI), his knowledge of the Shaker sect has so far passed virtually unnoticed by scholars. In contrast to the extended treatments of Shakers in the writings of Hawthorne and Emerson, only one other allusion by Melville is known: in his journal for 1856, during a visit to Constantinople, he observed that the "convent" of the Dancing Dervishes reminded him of his Berkshire neighbors. 3 But from the correspondence of Evert Duyckinck, who visited Melville at Pittsfield early in August of 1850, it is learned that he was interested enough during that summer to return to Hancock with a party of friends on August 7 and also to go to the nearby Shaker settlement at Lebanon, both communities being popular attractions in that day for summer residents and their guests. Another excursion to Lebanon on August 15, as well as one in the following year, is also recorded. It is clear, moreover, that Melville's acquaintance with Shaker beliefs and practices was more than cursory, for in his copy of A Summary View passages on 25 of its 384 pages have been checked, underlined, or marked with marginal lines in Melville's characteristic manner, familiar and unmistakable to those who have studied other volumes which were formerly part of his library; and in addition there is a brief annotation in his hand. Most of the marked passages, probably a fair indication of the direction of his interest, occur in the opening sections (Parts I and II), dealing with the history of the United Society and its distinctive forms of worship and government. The long exposition of Shaker theology and escha-tology which constitutes most of the book is virtually unmarked; whether Melville read this portion in its entirety or merely dipped into it here and there cannot be determined from the evidence at hand. It is not surprising that the Dancing Dervishes reminded Melville in later years of the Shakers, for in A Summary View several of the numerous passages on Shaker dancing are marked and one of them is annotated. "Curious," he observed in a penciled note, "that this dancing religion should have originated among the French." His reference is to an account in the text of the "remarkable revival" which occurred about 1689 in "Dauphiny and Vivarais" and "excited great attention." The subjects of this work were wrought upon in a very extraordinary manner, both in body and mind; nor could the violent agitations of their bodies, nor the powerful operations of their spirits, which appeared in the flaming and irresistable [ sic ] energy of their testimony, be imputed to any thing short of the mighty power of God , with which they were evidently inspired. Persons of both sexes and all ages, were the subjects of these divine inspirations. Men, women, and even little children, were wrought upon in a manner which struck the spectators with wonder and astonishment; and their powerful admonitions and prophetic warnings "were heard and received with reverence and awe." 4 In Melville, who had been fascinated by the themes of inspiration and prophetic utterance as early as Mardi (1849), this element of the Shaker tradition clearly struck a sympathetic chord. As divine truth and power increased among the early Shakers, it is stated, they were involuntarily led, by the mighty power of God, to go forth and worship in the dance. The apostolic gifts were also renewed in their full power; so that "they spake with new tongues and prophecied [ sic ]." In these operations, they were filled with melodious and heavenly songs, especially while under the operation of dancing. 5 This passage is marked with a marginal line and is also checked. Except for the emphasis on music and dancing, this same preoccupation with inspired utterance is characteristic of the Shaker sailor in Moby-Dick . Gabriel's "powerful admonitions and prophetic warnings," an ominous foreshadowing of the catastrophe to come, are "heard and received with reverence and awe" by his impressionable shipmates, but his testimony is presented to the reader as akin to that of the prophetic Elijah and the crazed negro Pip, in whom inspiration is allied with madness. Gabriel himself is characterized as a man in a "deep, settled, fanatic delirium," once a "great prophet" in the "cracked, secret meetings" of the Shakers. At sea he "announced himself as the archangel Gabriel" and commanded his captain to jump overboard. As for his message, he solemnly warned the Jeroboam's master, as he was later to warn Ahab, against attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. 6 Deluded or not, Gabriel's intuition is perfectly sound in prophesying "special doom to the sacrilegious assailants" of Moby-Dick, whether the White Whale is taken as agent or principal, incarnate deity or incarnate devil. For "man's insanity is heaven's sense," as Melville elsewhere remarks of the idiot Pip, 7 and Ahab's monomaniac quest of vengeance is the true madness. The marked passages just discussed are those with the greatest relevance to Moby-Dick and its single Shaker character, whose presence there can be fairly attributed to Melville's proximity to the Shaker communities and his study of A Summary View . There are other features of Shakerism, however, which interested him as well and which bear some relation to his thought and writing. In the historical section of A Summary View he marked accounts of various stages in the development of the sect: the formation of a "Society" near Manchester, England, circa 1747, the origin of the name "Shakers," the early persecutions of the Society's adherents. 8 Of particular interest was the story of the celebrated "Mother Ann" Lee, who led a group of Shakers to America in 1774. Melville marked a reference to her as the Society's "spiritual Mother in Christ ," 9 the "second Eve," considered inferior in spiritual eminence only to Christ Himself; he checked accounts of her initial revelation of 1770 and consequent spiritual rebirth. 10 When "born into the spiritual kingdom," Mother Ann declared, I was like an infant just brought into the world. They see colors and objects; but they know not what they see; and so it was with me. . . . But before I was twenty-four hours old, I saw, and I knew what I saw. 11 Here again is the theme of divine inspiration. Melville made no comment at this point, but one recalls the absolute contrast of his own vision of the spiritual world as reflected in the chapters of Moby-Dick on "The Whiteness of the Whale" and "The Try-Works," in the torment of Pierre, and in the forlorn words of the imprisoned Bartleby: "I know where I am." 12 Perhaps Melville's unwilling vacillation between belief and unbelief, remarked upon by Hawthorne, is a clue to his interest in the theme of spiritual revelation and the spiritual certainty of the inspired Shakeress. Attracted as he was to the story of Mother Ann, Melville was nevertheless openly skeptical of a miraculous deliverance which purportedly occurred during her voyage to America. The captain of her ship, it is related, became so irritated by the Shaker dancing that he considered throwing the company of believers into the sea. God protected them, however, and for their sakes preserved the ship and all on board when a terrific gale loosened a plank and threatened to swamp their vessel. Mother Ann, informing the captain that their ultimate safety had been assured to her by two angels, led the Shakers to assist the crew in manning the pumps. "Shortly after this, a large wave struck the ship with great violence, and the loose plank was instantly closed to its place." Melville, with a sailor's interest, marked the whole account with marginal lines, but after the mention of the wave that closed the leak he placed a revealing question-mark! 13 The remainder of the historical sketch is matter-of-fact, recounting how the members of the Society, after their safe arrival in America, contracted for land "near Niskeyuna," in the state of New York 14 —Melville underlined the name, which in a different spelling is mentioned in Moby-Dick with reference to Gabriel's Shaker background— and settled there. "Mother Ann, and a number of the leading characters," were imprisoned for a time in Albany in 1780, 15 but were released and permitted to establish additional communities. 16 Toward the equalitarian principles of the Shaker settlements the democratic Melville was probably not unsympathetic, although one infers from his remarks on the "Apostles" in Pierre that he was dubious about the practicality of social reformers in general. In A Summary View he checked several passages explaining the aims and methods of the Shaker community organization. Among "all the hopeful expectations, labors and desires of mankind, in the present age," one of these declares, none appear more evident that those which lead to the formation of associations in which all the members can enjoy equal rights and privileges, physical and moral, both of a spiritual and temporal nature, in a united capacity. Many have become fully convinced that this is the ultimate destiny of mankind, and that they can never enjoy that happiness for which their Creator designed them, in any other way than in such united capacity. 17 That the Shaker Society at New-Lebanon has existed there "about sixty years" without failure is cited as proof of the efficacy of its organization and government, 18 which is later described as follows: As the leading power of the visible Church is vested in the Ministry, as the visible head, so in each separate family of the Society, which is considered as a branch of the Church, the leading power is vested in the Elders, who are considered as the heads of their respective families. And so long as the visible head or leaders of any family conduct themselves in a manner worthy of this trust, it is necessary that they should be obeyed by all the members of the family. Without this obedience there can be no regulation, order nor harmony in the family. 19 Melville marked both this and another passage in the same vein: Now let any candid person examine the causes by which associations . . . so often fail, and he will find that it arises from the partial and selfish relations of husbands, wives and children, and other kindred relations, together with the jealousies and evil surmises naturally arising therefrom. 20 The reference is of course to communal organizations, but the passage is reminiscent of the bitterness arising between mother and son, brother and sister, and cousin and cousin in Pierre . Perhaps the fact that Melville himself had been living with relatives, even after his marriage, ever since his return from the South Seas in 1844 helps to account for his interest in the concept of the well-governed family. In view of his own family situation and the seeming ambivalence of his attitude toward the relation between the sexes—particularly in Pierre —, one wonders with what motives Melville marked various passages on the Shaker rule of continence, the principle underlying the communal organization of the Society. None of the passages called forth specific comment in the form of annotation, but he did underline the key phrase in a passage stating that Mother Ann bore an open testimony against the lustful gratifications of the flesh, as the source and foundation of human corruption ; and testified, in the most plain and pointed manner, that no soul could follow Christ in the regeneration, while living in the works of natural generation, or in any of the gratifications of lust. 21 Here again one is reminded of the idealistic Pierre, and the "terrible self-revelation" that comes upon him when he suddenly realizes the physical basis of his devotion to Isabel. 22 According to Mother Ann, physical passion is the root of all evil. She had in her visions a full and clear view of the mystery of iniquity, of the root and foundation of human depravity, and of the very act of transgression, committed by the first man and first woman in the garden of Eden. Here she saw whence and wherein all mankind were lost from God, and clearly realized the only possible way of recovery. 23 The "only possible way" is of course renunciation of the flesh for a life of celibacy. Since for Melville the Shaker practices were not an acceptable solution of the human problem—in Pierre it is implied that there is no solution—, he showed little interest in the detailed theological arguments for the celibate life which are contained in many of the later pages of A Summary View . But if he rejected the Shaker "solution," he at the same time agreed with much of the Shaker analysis of the alienation of mankind from God. Within a month after buying A Summary View he was writing, in "Hawthorne and His Mosses," of that Calvinistic sense of Innate Depravity and Original Sin, from whose visitations, in some shape or other, no deeply thinking mind is always and wholly free. For, in certain moods, no man can weigh this world without throwing in something, somehow like Original Sin, to strike the uneven balance. 24 With his growing belief in a neutral, impassive cosmos he must have agreed with the thought of a marked passage on the world's disorders and miseries: these defects are in the depraved nature of man. How then are they to be remedied? It is in vain to suppose that nature can remedy her own defects, and cure the depravity of her children. 25 But he did not mark a single passage in the long sections dealing with the Shaker conception of the nature of God and His works, the fall and depravity of man, and the reign of Antichrist (Parts III, IV, V). Only two pages are marked in the discussion of the second manifestation of Christ in the female (Part VI, Chapter IV) 26 and one in "The Faith and Principles of the New Creation" (Part VII)—the passage on obedience in families quoted above. 27 In summary, Melville's interest in the Shakers as indicated by the pattern of his markings is fairly clear. He checked key incidents in the general story of Shakerism, perhaps in order to qualify himself as a better guide when conducting his visiting New York friends to the Shaker villages, as he did again in the summer of 1851. The character of Mother Ann and the governing principles of the Shaker communities were other topics of interest. But what seemingly attracted him most was the prophetic strain in the Shaker religion, with its association of exalted bodily and mental states. Despite his evident skepticism toward Shaker sanity and the Shaker creed, he apparently agreed with their pessimistic outlook upon this earthly life, and was sympathetic toward their intuitive yearning for a better life to come. In his personal knowledge of the sect and in A Summary View lay the material for his characterization of the Shaker Gabriel in one of the most striking and portentous chapters of Moby-Dick .</field>

Comprising the Rise, Progress and Practical Order of the Society. Together with the General Principles of Their Faith and Testimony . Second edition, revised (Albany, Van Benthuysen, 1848). The book bears the following penciled inscription, in Melville's hand: 'H Melville | Shaker Village (Hancock, Mass:) | July 21 3t 1850. | Bought of Nathan Holland.' Inside the front cover is a cutting from a sale-catalogue—marked "Pierce &amp; Scopes—12/5/25"—which states that the book was "purchased in the house where he lived in Pittsfield. . . ." The volume was formerly part of the library of the late Edward L. Stone, of Roanoke, Virginia. On pp. ii and 358 Melville checked references to two other Shaker tracts: "The Sacred Roll and Book, written by Divine Inspiration" (title underlined by Melville) and an examination of scriptural texts on the resurrection of the body to be found in "Dunlavy's Manifesto, printed at Pleasant Hill, in Kentucky, 1818." 3 Journal up the Straits, October 11, 1856—May 5, 1857 , ed. by Raymond Weaver (New York, 1935), p. 29. 4 A Summary View , p. 8. Melville marked this passage with a marginal line, indicating by a cross that his annotation refers to the first and second sentences, and also checked the italicized phrase. On p. 78 he checked a reference to a religious awakening in America, " The Kentucky Revival ," which "commenced in the western states" about 1800. 5 Ibid. , p. 88. Melville also checked three Biblical quotations on dancing, p. 89 (five check-marks), and placed a cross beside the following sentence on p. 91: "In short, have not thefts, robberies and murders, and indeed every species of villany [ sic ], been much more excited and encouraged by music than by dancing?" Compare the baleful influence of the mysterious music of Isabel's guitar in Melville's Pierre (1852). 6 Moby-Dick , II, 40-43.

A footnote adds that according to some writers she "styled herself the Elect Lady; but this is a groundless charge: that title was given by her enemies in derision." The italicized words, so printed in both text and note, were also underlined by Melville. 10 Ibid. , p. 11. 11 Ibid. , p. 14. On p. 18 he also checked a report of how Mother Ann, while imprisoned, was secretly fed by means of a pipe-stem which one of her followers introduced through a key-hole. 12 "Bartleby the Scrivener" (1853), in Piazza Tales , p. 62. 13 A Summary View , p. 20. Insofar as marking of passages reveals, this is the only statement in the book which Melville questioned. He did, however, check a passage on p. 9 concerning false testimony inspired by Satan, and both marked and checked the accompanying footnote: "So it was of old. 'When the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, Satan came also among them.' Job, ii.1." It will be recalled that in Moby-Dick , when the mysterious Fedallah appears among the crew of the Pequod, Stubb takes him to be "the devil in disguise" (11, 55).

      <field name="heading_text">A Bibliographical Study of Parthenissa by Roger Boyle Earl of Orrery by C. William Miller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. THE EARLIEST PUBLICATION OF THE POPULAR heroic dramatist, Roger Boyle, Earl of Orrery, is his prose romance Parthenissa . Despite its literary barrenness, almost every historian of seventeenth-century English literature has felt obliged to mention the work because it stands as the only serious lengthy imitation in English of the French heroico-historical romances written by Gomberville, La Calprenède, and Scudéry. Some of the bibliographical problems which this English romance presents have, on the other hand, caught the attention of a few scholars, but no one has made a really intensive study of the various editions and issues of the romance as a problem in itself. The order of publication of certain basic editions of Parthenissa is above dispute, and since it is generally agreed upon by William Carew Hazlitt, 1 Arundell Esdaile, 2 and Donald G. Wing, 3 the three bibliographers of the romance, its presentation at this point will serve to assist the reader in following later explanations. At the end of this paper I shall present a more complete list incorporating several additional items cited in the course of the discussion. (1) Parthenissa (Part I, Books 1-6). 4 Printed for Richard Lownes, London, 1654. Collation: 4°, A-2L 4 2M 2 . A1: title-page, v. blank. (2) Parthenissa In Four Parts. Printed for Henry Herringman, London, 1655. The First Part Collation: 4°, A 4 (±A1; A3+A 2 +B 2 ) B-3G 4 [3H]1. A1: title-page, v. blank. The Second Part Collation: 4°, i 1 A-3M 4 3N1. i 1: title-page, v. blank. The Third Part Collation: 4°, i 1 * 2 A-3G 4 3H 2 . i 1: title-page, v. blank. The Fourth Part Collation: 4°, i 1 A-3E 4 . i 1: title-page, v. blank. (3) Parthenissa The Fifth Part. Printed by T. R. and E. M. for Henry Herringman, London, 1656. Collation: 4°, [A]1 B-2Q 4 2R1. [A]1: title-page, v. blank. (4) Parthenissa The Sixth Part. Printed for Henry Herringman, London, 1669. Collation: 4°, A-2Q 4 . A1: title-page, v. blank. (5) Parthenissa The Six Volumes Compleat. Printed by T. N. for Henry Herringman, London, 1676. Collation: 2°, A 2 B-3E 4 3F 2 , 3Q-5K 4 (5K4 blank(?), lacking in observed copies). A1: title-page, v. blank. The edition of Parthenissa which Esdaile prefixed to the above list and which he and all literary historians after him have considered to be the first, 5 he records thus: Parthenissa: A Romance. In Six Tomes. Composed by the Right Hon ble The Lord Broghill, etc. Peter de Pienne: Waterford. 1654-55. 4° 4 vols. 6 To this description Esdaile appended the note: "There is a transcript of the Waterford Title-pages by H. Bradshaw in U[niversity] L[ibrary] C[ambridge]." Hence Esdaile, who otherwise gave a location for each book he listed, had not seen a copy of the romance with Waterford imprints, but in making his entry, he believed at the time, as he has written me, that a copy with these title-pages must have existed somewhere. 7 The "transcript" to which he referred is set down in Bradshaw's handwriting on four separate leaves inserted after each of the four title-pages of copies of the four parts of Herringman's Parthenissa (London, 1655), which Bradshaw once owned and later gave to University Library Cambridge along with his extensive collection of Irish books. 8 In these notes Bradshaw makes no mention of the owner or the library location of the Waterford set, the titles of which he is presumably transcribing in his library manuscript insertions. Yet such facts as these he might perhaps be expected to include in a detailed description of a rare example of provincial Irish printing not in his private collection or in that of University Library Cambridge. In fact, Bradshaw never says that he is making notes from a particular set of volumes. On the verso of each of the four inserted leaves he simply summarizes the contents, including story-headings and pagination, of each of the four volumes, which except for the title-pages are identical with those in the Herringman, London, 1655 set. On the recto of each leaf, however, he seems to be describing a series of title-pages, all recorded with the same careful regard for detail as this first one: Parthenissa: | A Romance. | In six Tomes. | Composed by the Right Hon ble | The Lord Broghill. | The first Tome | containing the first four Books of | The First Part. | Dedicated to the Lady Northumberland. | [ Here Bradshaw sketches in an ornament ] | Printed at Waterford by Peter de Pienne | in the year 1654. [Bradshaw dates the second tome 1654 and the third and fourth tomes, 1655.] To assume, as Esdaile did, that Bradshaw's notes constitute transcripts of actual printed title-pages, a fact presumably indicated by the lineation and the sketches of ornaments in the manuscript insertions, obliges the bibliographer to face at least one inconsistency in the practice of either Boyle or de Pienne. Boyle notes in his preface, inserted in the first gathering of Parthenissa , The First Part, Herringman, 1655, and written after 'the finishing of the Fourth Tome,' or Herringman's 'The Fourth Part,' that while he had originally planned to write Parthenissa in six tomes he has so far completed only four and that if he undertakes the last two it will be in penance for having done the first four. In fact, it was not until 1669, some fifteen years later, that Boyle completed the sixth 'tome' and had it printed and published through Herringman in London. Yet Bradshaw's notes carry 'In six Tomes' in the description of all four Waterford title-pages presumably printed in 1654-55. A much more plausible alternative interpretation of the Bradshaw notes, which can be supported by abundant evidence and which accounts for the apparent inconsistency just presented, is that Bradshaw shrewdly recognizing the sheets of the romance Parthenissa in quarto with Herringman, London, 1655, prefixed title-pages to be actually the presswork of an Irish provincial printer, undertook to construct a set of hypothetical title-pages which would describe as accurately as he could determine them the facts of the printing of the romance. This explanation of the objectives of Bradshaw's investigation certainly squares with the "natural-history" method which he first applied with great success to his historical classification of volumes lacking dates and printers' names in University Library Cambridge. 9 Strong evidence supporting the "construction" explanation exists in the form of personal testimonies from G. W. Prothero, Bradshaw's biographer; Francis Jenkinson, his bibliographical protégé and successor as librarian of U.L.C.; and Sir Norman Moore, one of his friends. Prothero writes: One of the last things he was working at was Lord Orrery's romance 'Parthenissa', which was supposed, from the title-page, to have been printed in London, but which he ingeniously proved to have been printed in 1654 at Waterford, where the author was at that time staying. 10 Jenkinson, after examining Esdaile's newly published List (1912), wrote the following in a private letter to the compiler: I am writing however to make sure that you know about Boyle's Parthenissa . . . . If I remember right, the whole of the text in six tomes was printed in Waterford; 11 whether title-pages have been seen I do not know. The whole of the stock got into the hands of Herringman, who had his own titles printed. I think Bradshaw's titles are merely reconstructions [ sic ], not transcripts. 12 Sir Shane Leslie, in a comparatively recent essay on Bradshaw, substantiates the opinions of Prothero and Jenkinson with information given him by one of Bradshaw's friends. There is no one who remembers Henry Bradshaw today as a living librarian but I have always hung on the words of those who had known and tested his marvelous powers: such as Provost M. R. James and Sir Norman Moore. The latter always told me of his decipherment of the proper titles of the anonymous 17th century romance Parthenissa described as 'Printed in London 1655'. Only recently I examined his own copy in the University Library. Bradshaw in his own script had written the title-page as 'composed by the Right Hon. the Lord Broghill' and he had proved from the types that it was 'printed at Waterford by Peter de Pienne in the year 1654.' 13 Clearly these accounts are at odds on how Bradshaw proved his case, but all agree on the central point that he was attempting to establish the actual printer, place of publication, and date of Parthenissa from available bibliographical information, not that he was recording information derived from the titles of any copies which he had seen. There now remains, in substantiation of the personal testimony, the necessity for demonstrating how Bradshaw probably went about constructing his hypothetical title-pages. He had available to him in his own collection the entire six parts of the romance in quarto issued by Herringman, London, 1655-69, the Herringman 1676 folio, and the two issues of Cook's Monarchy No Creature of God's Making , printed and sold in Waterford by de Pienne (1651) and reissued in London by Brewster in 1652. 14 His biographer states that the Parthenissa problem was one of the last on which he had been working before his death in 1886; therefore in all probability the new light on the Parthenissa problem which gave impetus to his research at that late date was the entry "Parthenissa 4° 1654" in the second volume of the British Museum Catalogue published in 1884. The only scrap of evidence of Bradshaw's work on the romance, other than the title-page notes, is the description of that B. M. copy of the R. Lownes 1654 London edition—the one preceding Herringman's—preserved in his notebooks. 15 It is improbable that he was aided by manuscript copies of either the Stationers' Register (1913-14) or The Letters of Dorothy Osborne (1888), both published after his death. Of the facts included in the Bradshaw title-page notes for the first tome 16 quoted earlier, the title of the romance, the dedication, and the part and book numbers could have been readily derived from the Herringman 1655 title-pages. 'Parthenissa A Romance' follows the Herringman title-page verbatim. In place of Herringman's 'In Four Parts', Bradshaw has substituted 'In six Tomes', a phrase suggested by the words 'The Last Part | The Sixth Tome' on the title-page of the Herringman 1669 quarto edition of The Sixth Part. The words 'Composed by the Right Hon ble | The Lord Broghill' follow the Lownes title-page phrasing exactly, even to capitalization, punctuation, lineation, and abbreviation except that Lownes prints 'Hon oble ' and Bradshaw writes 'Hon ble '. Having previously referred to the six major divisions of the romance as 'tomes,' Bradshaw is only consistent in substituting 'The First Tome' in place of Herringman's 'The First Part,' while the phrase 'containing the first four Books of The First Part,' which appears on neither the Lownes nor the Herringman title-pages, is certainly Bradshaw's attempt to define precisely the contents of each 'tome' in the face of the confusing dual system of numbering the divisions of the romance found in the Herringman publication. The words 'Dedicated to the Lady Northumberland' appear on both the Lownes and Herringman title-pages. The imprint which Bradshaw composed follows, except for two deletions, 17 the phrasing employed by de Pienne in his imprint of Cook's Monarchy No Creature of God's Making . Bradshaw's identification of de Pienne as the printer and Waterford as the place of printing resulted almost certainly from his intimate knowledge of the history and press work of early Irish printers, which enabled him to identify from memory the characteristics of de Pienne's type, border designs, and craftsmanship in the Herringman quartos. If Bradshaw had had any doubts about the accuracy of his identification, even a casual comparison of his copy of the Herringman Parthenissa quartos with his copies of Cook's Monarchy printed by de Pienne in 1651 would have revealed to him that the fonts, border designs, and decorative capitals were identical. Further, de Pienne's faulty workmanship in permitting the 'beards' of the letters to print 18 on the top and bottom lines of most of the pages of Parthenissa is also evident on almost every page of Cook's book. De Pienne's printing career centered on the towns of Cork and Waterford; the two extant books printed with his name on the title-page in the 1650's bear Waterford imprints. 19 Bradshaw's settling on the dates 1654-55 for the printing of the romance is incorrect, as I shall demonstrate later in this paper. Sir Shane Leslie's statement that Bradshaw "proved from the types that it [Part One] was printed . . . in the year 1654' is obviously inaccurate since de Pienne used the same types in 1651. Equally questionable is Prothero's statement that 'Bradshaw ingeniously proved [a part of Parthenissa ] to have been printed in 1654 at Waterford where the author was at that time staying.' An author's residence in a particular town during a certain year is hardly proof for establishing the printing date of a book, especially when the Boyle family seat, Lismore Castle, was located only a short distance from Waterford. The fact is that by June, 1654, Boyle had left Ireland for London. 20 If Bradshaw had proved to his satisfaction that Boyle was residing in Waterford during the first half of that year, he did so on the basis of evidence unknown to Boyle's careful modern biographer, Professor W. S. Clark, II, who had access to all extant family papers. In all probability Bradshaw settled on the dates 1654-55 by reasoning that de Pienne working alone or at most with one assistant must have set up and printed off approximately half of the text of the lengthy romance sometime in 1654 if he was able to have completed and shipped to London the sheets of all four volumes in time for Herringman to publish them with his own titles in 1655. Or he might have conjectured, or perhaps even determined by collation, that the Lownes 1654 Parthenissa , Part I, Books 1-6, was set from the de Pienne text and hence that the bulk of the first two tomes must have been printed off by 1654. The only detail of Bradshaw's title-page notes now unaccounted for is his ornament sketches. All four ornaments are drawn in the meagerest detail and do not appear to be careful efforts to copy particular title-page ornaments. They most nearly resemble large asterisks; the two on the title-pages of the tomes which Bradshaw believed were printed in 1654 are identical and are very slightly differentiated from the two identical ones on the title-pages of the tomes dated 1655. De Pienne did not use an ornament on the title-page of either his Cork Eikon Basilike or his Waterford Monarchy , nor did Herringman's printer use an ornament on his London 1655 title-pages. Lownes, however, did use one on his 1654 title-page, and since it has been pointed out that Bradshaw depended on the Lownes title-page for the lines of his hypothetically constructed title-pages stating the authorship, even to the point of reproducing capitalization, lineation, punctuation, and abbreviation, one can only suppose that in drawing up his notes in title-page form he satisfied a decorative whim 21 by inserting an ornament as Lownes had done, making the ornaments for the title-pages of Tomes One and Two, dated 1654, identical and those for the title-pages of Tomes Three and Four, dated 1655, likewise identical. The evidence presented so far, therefore, establishes two points: (1) Mr. Esdaile was mistaken in interpreting Bradshaw's title-page reconstructions as recordings of the titles of an actual edition printed in 1654-55, and (2) Bradshaw's significant contribution to Parthenissa bibliography was his identifying de Pienne as the printer of the quarto sheets offered for sale in London by Herringman in 1655.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. Earlier in this paper the printing dates 1654-55 set down by Bradshaw in his reconstructions were called inaccurate. It remains now to prove the validity of that assertion and to establish the actual date of printing. As early as September, 1653, Dorothy Osborne, in writing to William Temple on the subject of romances, states: 'My Lord Broghill sure will give us something worth the reading.' 22 On October 12, 1653, Herringman had Parthenissa entered in the Stationers' Register as 'a romance heretofore written by the Lo: Broghall.' 23 In an issue of the Mercurius Politicus dated 'From Thursday January 19. to Thursday January 26. 1654' the Lownes Parthenissa was advertised for sale. By mid-February, 1653/54, Dorothy Osborne had received a copy of Parthenissa from her brother in London and had almost finished reading it. These pieces of evidence attest to the fact that Boyle had certainly written at least six books of Part One, the whole of the contents of the Lownes Parthenissa , sometime before 1654. If it now can be established that the Lownes text was set from that of de Pienne—and it is reasonable to suppose that a second edition would be set from printed copy rather than from manuscript provided that a printed copy were available—then de Pienne must have printed a portion of Part One sometime before 1654 also. The collation of the text of 'The First Part' (Part One, Books 1-4), which Bradshaw had identified as the press work of de Pienne published by Herringman, with the corresponding text of the first four books of Part One printed for Lownes reveals three types of evidence pointing to Lownes' dependence on the de Pienne text. (1) In eleven instances de Pienne undertook to enclose a phrase in parentheses and failed to include either the opening or closing parenthesis. The Lownes compositor erred in identical fashion on nine occasions, managing to supply de Pienne's omissions only twice. (2) De Pienne almost habitually used a two-line-high capital for the first word in the text following either the close of an intercalated episode or the presentation of an epistle written by one romance character to another. Seventeen times de Pienne used a two-line-high capital, and eight times he employed a capital of the same font as the rest of the line. In all twenty-five instances the Lownes compositor followed the de Pienne practice. On four occasions de Pienne introduced a new division of text with a head decoration and a large capital; on each occasion the Lownes compositor did the same. Three times de Pienne set the first letter of the first word in a new segment of text with a two-line-high capital and then set the rest of the letters in that word in one-line-high capitals. The Lownes compositor in each instance set the first word in like manner. (3) The Lownes compositor, after correcting repeatedly in his text the literal errors committed by de Pienne, finally permitted inadvertently the following error to creep into his London text. The passage which in de Pienne reads: '. . . for Canitius and Castus with those 400 men that were yet in oae of the Groves for our Reserve', is reproduced in Lownes with the word one misprinted in the same odd way. 24 The evidence, therefore, in favor of resetting is so conclusive that one may state definitely that the Lownes compositor set his text from de Pienne's, not from an independent manuscript, and hence that at least the first six books of Part One—all that was reprinted by Lownes—were printed by de Pienne at some time earlier than 1654, the date fixed by Bradshaw. Thus the first of Bradshaw's conjectured dates is proved to be inaccurate, but, if the reader recalls, Bradshaw suggested the printing date 1654 for only the first and second tomes (Part I, Books 1-8). Tomes Three and Four (Part II, Books 1-8), he believed, were printed in 1655. External evidence to prove or disprove the validity of Bradshaw's second date is lacking, but the internal evidence of the headlines in the text of the four tomes printed by de Pienne and published by Herringman points to the fact that Bradshaw was also inaccurate in advancing the date 1655 and in believing that a break occurred between the printing of the first two and the last two quarto volumes. De Pienne, in printing the four tomes of Parthenissa which Herringman published in London, used throughout two skeletons per sheet. By means of the inevitable alterations which from time to time creep into headlines 25 it has been possible to trace overlapping series starting with the inner forme of the Ee gathering in the first tome and ending with the outer forme of the last complete gathering in the fourth tome. It can be stated confidently, therefore, that there is no indication of any break in the printing of sufficient extent to lead to the distribution of the skeletons; instead, it may be concluded that printing was normally continuous. The evidence gathered from the collation of the de Pienne and the Lownes texts proved that the Lownes text was reset from de Pienne's and hence that de Pienne's printing date for the first tome (Part I, Books 1-4) and half of the second tome (Part I, Books 5-6) was earlier than 1654. The evidence of the de Pienne headlines in all four tomes proves that printing was continuous. Hence one is obliged to conclude that not just Part One, Books 1-6, but actually all eight books of Part One and of Part Two, the whole of the four quarto volumes, were printed earlier than 1654. How much earlier than 1654 de Pienne started the printing is the question that must next be considered. To give a definite answer would be well nigh impossible were it not for the existence of a copy of Parthenissa containing the de Pienne sheets as later published by Herringman but with a unique title-page dated 1651 26 as the first leaf, the text including the whole of Parts One and Two or the equivalent of the four "Parts" of the Herringman 1655 publication. This lone title-page in a copy found among the holdings of the University of Texas Library bears only the romance title "PARTHENISSA" in large capitals and an imprint: "Printed in the yeare 1651." The type used to print this title-page is identical with that used elsewhere by de Pienne, and the leaf bears part of a watermark identical with that found on several other leaves in Part One. Because the set has been tightly bound into two volumes by a modern binder, it is impossible to determine positively whether the title-page A1 is conjugate with A4, the fourth leaf of the first gathering in fours, but the chain lines and complementary parts of the same watermark seem to meet, and the signatures of the other leaves seem to warrant such a conclusion. 27 The make-up of the first leaf makes it questionable whether de Pienne ever meant it to serve as a commercial title-page since the facts of authorship, printer, and place of printing normally included on his title-pages are missing. The presence of an imprint date rules out one's considering it a half-title, and the leaf does not bear the information found normally on a section-title. Its contents seem to resemble those intended simply for an identifying title-page on a work privately printed, the printer's expectation being that once the romance was completely printed and publication arrangements made, de Pienne or some bookseller would cancel the temporary title-page and substitute a normal one. The bibliographical evidence offered earlier points definitely to de Pienne's printing the four quarto tomes of Parthenissa before 1654. The imprint on the title of the Texas copy fixes the date of printing as 1651. The evidence next to be presented suggests the likelihood of de Pienne's doing the printing in about the year 1651. Professor W. S. Clark, II, Boyle's biographer, states that Boyle served as an officer in the Irish Commonwealth forces from April, 1650, to June, 1654, and that he was most busily engaged in campaigns during the years 1650-52. 28 Hence, in a letter to me, Professor Clark stated that there might be a question whether Boyle could have found time to compose any large portion of his romance in the early 'fifties. The reasonable alternative explanation is, then, that Boyle must have completed the bulk of his writing sometime earlier. In any case all the campaigns in which Boyle served took place in the south of Ireland 29 ; therefore, it is probable that he had a few opportunities to visit Lismore Castle, the family seat, and possibly at least one opportunity to make arrangements for the printing of his romance with de Pienne in Waterford, some thirty miles away. Like Boyle, de Pienne had previously been royalist in his sympathies as his printing of the Eikon Basilike at Cork in 1649 attests, but by 1651 he had moved to Waterford and had begun operating the Commonwealth press from which he issued Cook's Monarchy No Creature of God's Making (1651) and An Act for the Settlement of Ireland (1652). According to an order issued by the Council for the Affairs of Ireland dated at Kilkenny on September 30, 1652, de Pienne's press was locked up and his salary stopped, 30 but at some point in the year 1651 he could certainly have initiated a private printing job for an officer high in the regard of the Commonwealth government by whom de Pienne himself was employed. Further, the fact that no books bearing de Pienne's imprint dated later than 1652 are known affords us at least the negative evidence for believing that de Pienne ceased printing in that year. Establishing the date 1651 as in all probability correct for the printing of Parthenissa clears the way for a consideration of the complete setting and printing of this unique quarto in relation to its subsequent publication in London. The fact that it included all eight books of Part One and of Part Two, which Herringman offered for sale 'In Four Parts', each of Herringman's parts bearing a title-page, and yet that it exists with only an elementary title points to two conclusions: (1) De Pienne did not offer the romance for sale in Ireland; otherwise he would have cancelled the elementary title-leaf and supplied titles bearing his own imprint for all four tomes. (2) The state of this set is that of the sheets as they came to Herringman, who cut out the first leaf, leaving the telltale stub on A4, 31 inserted his cancel title-leaf, and then supplied the three other divisions, which had never had title-leaves, with his own title-pages. The University of Texas copy is, therefore, I suspect, the only extant copy of several perhaps retained in Ireland for distribution among Boyle's friends. Barring short printing of Herringman's title-pages, it is unlikely that the bookseller would have parted with a copy of the romance in London lacking his title-pages unless it were to the importunate author himself. If this explanation of the state of the Texas University copy and of the de Pienne-Herringman relationship is accurate, the various editions of Parthenissa follow this order: (1) Parthenissa , Part One, Books 1-8, and Part Two, Books 1-8, 'Printed in the yeare 1651', constitutes the first issue of the first edition. (2) Parthenissa , Part One, Books 1-6, 'For R. Lownes . . . London, 1654', stands as a second setting of type done from the de Pienne text and is therefore a second edition, although it is presumably the first text offered for public sale. (3) Parthenissa , Part One, Books 1-8, and Part Two, Books 1-8, 'For H. Herringman . . . London, 1655', is the second issue of the first edition. Thus the second issue of the first edition of Parthenissa , Parts I and II, Books 1-8, was offered for sale after that of the Lownes second edition of Part One, Books 1-6. In addition, Parthenissa , Part One, Books 7-8, and all eight books of Part Two, which Herringman divided in two and called the Third and Fourth Parts, were offered for sale by Herringman presumably for the first time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3. Once Herringman had received the sheets from de Pienne, he did not, however, attempt to sell all of them at his own London shop, for one incomplete set of the romance, consisting only of "The First Part," "The Second Part," and "The Third Part," now in the Huntington Library, 32 exists with Herringman title-pages bearing the press-variant imprints of Humphrey Moseley, 33 the leading London bookseller and foremost dealer in romances at that time. How the title-pages for this Herringman-Moseley London publication of Parthenissa were printed is bibliographically informative, especially in view of an error on the printer's part which caused the title-page imprint for "The Third Part" to exist with three variants. The London title-pages of the four parts of the romance all have the same general appearance, and all are printed in two colors of ink, black and red. The distribution of matter printed in the two colors of ink on the title-pages of all four parts follows this of the Herringman state of the 'The First Part': [Red] PARTHENISSA, | [black] A | ROMANCE. | [rule] | [red] In Four Parts. | [black] [rule] | Dedicated to the Lady | NORTHUMBERLAND , | And the Lady | SUNDERLAND . | [rule] | [red] The First Part. | [black] [rule] | LONDON , | Printed for [red] Henry Herringman , [black] and are to be sold at his | Shop at the Anchor in the Lower Walk of the | New-Exchange . 1655. A comparison of the four title-pages reveals at once that the title-pages for 'The First Part' and 'The Third Part' are printed with the exception of the necessary substitution of 'Third' for 'First' from one and the same setting of type and that the title-pages for 'The Second Part' and 'The Fourth Part' are likewise printed from one and the same setting of type, but a setting of type different from that used for the printing of the title-pages for the first and third parts. 34 Further, one of the title-pages bears half of a watermark on the outer edge of the leaf. 35 With the help of these clues the method of printing the title-pages may be readily reconstructed. The printing was evidently done by a modified form of half-sheet imposition. The two different type-settings for Parts One and Two were imposed side by side in half of a regular quarto forme and printed together at one time. Upon completion of the run, the formes were unlocked, the part numbering was altered to 'Third' and 'Fourth,' and the title-pages for these parts were machined. Whether this second machining perfected the previous sheets or whether a complete run of printing and perfecting was made for each set of title-pages is impossible to determine. Thus the general method of printing may be explained, but there are two other printing operations which call for particular consideration. The first of these is the way in which the title-pages were printed in two colors of ink. Several faint but distinct red ink overprintings of type meant to appear only in black, one of them a full line, indicate first that two machinings took place, one for the letterpress in black ink, the other for the letterpress in red ink; and second that the letterpress appearing in red ink was printed by means of raised type in a forme which also contained the letterpress meant to appear only in black. This method is the normal one as described by Moxon 36 except that the pressman neglected to cut a specially designed frisket to prevent the red ink printing from type which had previously printed in black. The second operation worth attention is that involving the stop-press substitution of Moseley's imprint for Herringman's and the attendant error of the pressman which produced a hybrid imprint. The pressman, having wrought off his sheets black, an operation in which he stopped his press only once for the substitution of the Moseley imprint in place of that of Herringman, returned the forme to the stone where the compositor removed certain rows of quads in favor of the raised type to appear in red ink. With the second or red ink machining underway for the Herringman title-pages of Parts Three and Four, the pressman needed to watch only for the last sheet bearing the Herringman black ink imprint in order once again to stop his press for the substitution of Moseley's name in place of Herringman's. Evidently in the instance of the Yale University Library Part Three title-page, the pressman either failed to stop the press immediately after he had wrought off the last sheet bearing the Herringman imprint in black or failed to notice a stray sheet bearing the Moseley imprint in black mixed among the sheets carrying the Herringman black ink imprint. Whatever the circumstance, the error was made and later rectified with the following results: there exist two correct states of the title-page, (1) Herringman's name in red ink in the correct black ink imprint and (2) Moseley's name in red ink in the correct black ink imprint. The third state is the hybrid with Herringman's name in red ink in the black ink portion of Moseley's imprint. 37</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4. The final edition of Parthenissa is the folio reprint of all six parts printed by Thomas Newcomb, Sr., and published by Herringman in 1676. The volume presents one minor bibliographical problem which is clear cut and readily lends itself to a definite solution. The text seems to indicate clearly that two compositors set the copy; the problem rests with determining the exact division of their labors. Evidence pointing to the work of two compositors is of several sorts. First to be noted is an abrupt break in pagination between Parts Three and Four, a skip in numbering from page 403 to 485, accompanied by a similar interruption in signatures, a skip from 3F2 to 3Q1, evidently the result of a very inaccurate job of casting off copy. Second, from gathering 3Q to the end of the volume there occur two pairs of running-titles—each compositor used two skeletons in imposing the folio gatherings in fours—entirely different from those appearing in the first portion of the volume. Third, the type-page for all full pages from 3Q to the end contains consistently 53 lines (24 1/2 cm.) while that of all full pages in the first part of the volume contains consistently only 52 (24 cm.). From this positive evidence we may conclude that the text was divided between two compositors, A and B: compositor A beginning with signature B, the first gathering with normal running titles; compositor B starting arbitrarily with 3Q, the first leaves of Part Four. The variations in running-titles and in the number of lines to the full page indicate that the type set by each compositor was printed in different sets of formes. If the compositors were setting simultaneously, as probably they were, two presses would have been used of necessity. In addition to these general conclusions, however, there is this one point to be noted. One stretch of 23 pages, extending from page 377 (3C1) to page 403 (3F2) in the first portion of the volume set by compositor A, exhibits all the characteristics of the work of compositor B and of the formes which his pressman was using. Each full page has 53 lines of letterpress, and all the running-titles, starting with page 377 or signature 3C1 and running to page 403 or signature 3F2 are different from all those of the rest of the first portion of the volume and identical with all those of the second portion of the volume. Thus the general conclusions for the setting up and printing of the folio text are these: the text was divided between two compositors, A and B, working simultaneously, each with a different press. Compositor A set the type for pages 1 (B1) to 376 (3B4 v ). Compositor B set the type for pages 485-808 (3Q1-5K3 v ), the whole of the text of Parts Four, Five, and Six. Since the composing assignment of compositor B was 53 pages shorter than that of compositor A, compositor B very likely finished his task before his fellow workman, and then undertook to help compositor A complete his stint by setting up the text of the last 23 pages (pages 377-403), 3C1-3F2 of Part Three. It is unreasonable to conclude that compositor B completed Part Three before starting on the text of the last three parts; if he had, the abrupt break in pagination and signatures would not have occurred.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Bibliographical Collections and Notes on Early English Literature, 1474-1700 , 3rd ser., III (1887), 22-23. Hazlitt fails to record the R. Lownes 1654 quarto edition, of which apparently he was unaware. 2 A List of English Tales and Prose Romances Printed Before 1740 (London, 1912), p. 167. Dr. Thomas P. Haviland, 'The Roman de Longue Haleine on English Soil' (Philadelphia, 1931), p. 182, gives a Parthenissa bibliography based on Mr. Esdaile's. Dr. Haviland's statement, however, that item '12635. pp. 26' in the British Museum is an 'edition' which 'Esdaile has apparently overlooked' is inaccurate. That set is Parts I-V of the Herringman 1655-56 publication in quarto which Mr. Esdaile records with a Bodleian location. Mr. Esdaile's not citing a B. M. location may be explained on the grounds that the set was acquired after publication of his List . 3 Short-Title Catalogue . . . 1641-1700 (New York, 1948), II, 510. 4 Since Boyle has greatly confused literary historians and bibliographers by employing simultaneously two systems for numbering the multiple divisions of his romance, it is necessary at the outset to explain his dual practice. According to one system outlined by Boyle in his preface, the romance was thought of as falling into six general divisions or "tomes," each consisting of four subdivisions called "books." Herringman, Boyle's London bookseller, followed the author's plan and published the romance in six quarto sections of four "books" each, but used the word "part" instead of "tome" on the title-page of each of the six sections. Hence Herringman's "The First Part" is the equivalent of Boyle's first tome, etc. The great confusion arises in that while Boyle in his preface was thinking of the romance as falling generally into six divisions or tomes, he had in the internal headings actually divided the romance into three "parts," each containing eight rather than four "books," a numbering system followed by the compositor and carried along page-by-page with the running titles. Therefore each Boyle "tome" consists of one-half of each Boyle "part," and likewise each Herringman "part" consists of one-half of each Boyle "part." Herringman's title-page, "The First Part," is affixed to the text of Boyle's Part I, Books 1-4; H's "The Second Part" to B's Part I, Books 5-8; H's "The Third Part" to B's Part II, Books 1-4; H's "The Fourth Part to B's Part II, Books 5-8; H's "The Fifth Part" to B's Part III, Books 1-4; H's "The Sixth Part" to B's Part III, Books 5-8. 5 Mr. Wing, the latest bibliographer, does not list a 1654-55 edition because, as he has written me, he was unable to find a copy of such an edition in any of the libraries he visited in the United States or the British Isles. This failure to discover an example does not prove, of course, that a copy dated 1654-55 never existed. 6 Esdaile, loc. cit. 7 Mr. Esdaile had not yet located a copy when I last communicated with him in 1939. My inquiries printed in The New York Times , (July 9, 1939) VI, 19, 3; in Notes and Queries , vol. 177, no. 6 (August 5, 1939), p. 98; and in The Colophon , vol. 1, no. 3 (September, 1939), p. 84, produced no information. 8 See Cambridge University Library: Bradshaw Irish Collection (London, 1916), II, 900.

Parts Five and Six were set up by London printers hired by Herringman. 12 I am indebted to Mr. Esdaile for this information. 13 "Henry Bradshaw, Prince of Bibliographers," in To Doctor R. Essays here collected and published in honor of the seventieth birthday of Dr. A. S. W. Rosenbach, July 22, 1946 (Philadelphia, 1946), p. 134. It is not likely that Bradshaw thought of himself as the discoverer of the author of Parthenissa , for in his private collection he had two parts of the romance bearing the author's name and found a third in 1884 listed under Boyle's name in the British Museum Catalogue , vol. II. 14 See Entry Nos. 5315, 6140, 5313-14 in U. L. C. Bradshaw Irish Collection . 15 I am indebted for this information and for a transcript of Bradshaw's Parthenissa title-page notes to Mr. J. C. T. Oates, Assistant-under-Librarian at University Library Cambridge. 16 The Bradshaw notes for the title-pages of the other three tomes parallel so closely that for the first tome, except in necessary alterations of part and book numbers, dedica-cation, and dates, that an analysis of Bradshaw's method in drawing up the first title-page will suffice for the others. 17 The full imprint on the title-page of Cook's Monarchy reads, 'Printed at Waterford in Ireland by Peter de Pienne in the yeare of our Lord God, 1651.' 18 See Joseph Moxon, Mechanick Exercises (London, 1683), pp. 293-94 for discussion of this point. 19 E.

I succeeded in locating it several years later among the holdings of the Huntington Library and recorded its existence in the printed abstract of my dissertation. Mr. Wing has included the three unique Moseley imprints of the set in Volume II of his Short-Title Catalogue . . . 1641-1700 , but cites them erroneously as parts of "another edition." 33 These imprints are not included in the list of works published by Moseley which was compiled by John Curtis Reed, "Humphrey Moseley, Publisher," Oxford Bibliographical Society Proceedings , II, 2 (1928), 104-116. 34 Obvious differences in the two settings of type are the broken tail on the second swash 'R' in Northumberland on the title-pages of the second and fourth parts, and the clipped base on the right leg of the first 'A' in the phrase 'A ROMANCE' on the title-pages of the first and third parts. 35 The title-page for 'The Third Part' in the Yale University Library set. 36 J. Moxon, op. cit. , pp. 328-30. 37 If the method for printing the title-pages of the third and fourth parts simultaneously, as outlined above, is accurately reconstructed, there once must have existed or still do exist unrecorded two title-pages of 'The Fourth Part' with variant imprints: one, a hybrid imprint like that on the Yale University Library Part Three title-page; the second, a correct Moseley imprint like that in the Huntington set. It is unlikely that Moseley offered for sale only three of the four parts of Parthenissa while Herringman at the same time was offering for sale all four parts.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Dryden's Indian Emperour: The Early Editions and their Relation to the Text by James S. Steck</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HUGH MACDONALD IN HIS DRYDEN Bibliography listed ten editions of Dryden's play, The Indian Emperour , appearing between 1667 and 1696. 1 However, since the publication of Macdonald's bibliography, it has been discovered that two other editions of the play were printed and issued, one in 1670 and the other in 1696. The existence of the latter edition was reported by E. N. Hooker, who found it in the William A. Clark Library. 2 More recently, Fredson Bowers has discovered another edition of the play bearing the date 1670. 3 Macdonald did not attempt to establish a genealogical order for the texts of the play or to demonstrate the exemplum from which each edition after the second was printed, being content merely to list the plays according to the dates which appeared on their title-pages. The present study attempts to supply this previously unrecorded textual history of the play. The following table of the first thirteen editions of The Indian Emperour shows the numbering adopted by Macdonald for his Dryden bibliography as emended by Osborn's article, together with the corresponding list which appears in Wood-ward and McManaway's Check List of English Plays . For convenience in referring to the various editions these are also identified alphabetically and rearranged in the true order of their printing as revealed by a bibliographical comparison of the several texts. Edition Date Macdonald Woodward and McManaway A 1667 69a 414 B 1668 69b 415-416 C 1670 [69c 1 -Bowers] [417a-Bowers] 4 D 1670 69c 417 E 1670 69d 418 F 1681 69e 419 G 1686 69f 420 H 1692 69g 421 I 1694 69h 422 J 1696 69k 425 K 1696 [69j-Osborn] 424 L 1696 69i 423 Folio 1701 107ai --- After the first edition of The Indian Emperour was published in 1667, Dryden wrote "A Defence of an Essay of Dramatique Poesie," which appeared for the first and only time in some copies of the second edition of the play, although cancelled in most. The introductory words of the essay indicate that Dryden himself carefully edited the 1668 edition which it prefaced: The former Edition of The Indian Emperour being full of faults which had escaped the Printer, I have been willing to overlook this second with more care; and though I could not allow my self so much time as was necessary yet by that little I have done, the Press is freed from some gross errors which it had to answer for before. 5 However, Dryden made few major changes in edition B (1668). Except for the deletion of one couplet which appears as lines 26-27 on G1 v of edition A (p. 314, ll. 26-27), 6 As when the Head distempers does endure, Each several part must join t'effect the cure. and the omission of three lines in the prologue, A4 v , ll. 8-10 (274: 21-23), the changes made by Dryden serve simply to regularize the meter and to clarify the meaning of his verse. For example, in edition A three lines, D4, ll. 35-37 (297: 22-24), reading, Poor Heart! She slumbers deep, deep in her silent Tomb, Let her possess in Peace that narrow Room. appear in edition B as, Poor Heart! She slumbers in her silent Tomb, Let her possess in Peace that narrow Room. a rendering which better conforms to the metrical pattern of the rest of the text. The couplet on H2 of A , ll. 6-7 (322: 3-4), reading, Ah! Cursed Woman, what was my Design! At least this Weapon both our Blood shall joyn. becomes in edition B , Ah! Cursed Woman, what was my Design! This Weapons point shall mix that blood with mine! a change which one would scarcely expect from a printer unless the text had been edited authoritatively. Edition B is a page-for-page reprint of edition A with but one exception. In edition A , sig. C3 ends with line 38 (288: 18), Orb. He has commanded you with me to go. But edition B appends the following line of the text drawn from the next page and ends, therefore, Orb. He has commanded you with me to go. Cyd. Has he not sent to bring the stranger too? This same change in the number of lines on sig. C3 of edition B is useful in determining that the three 1670 editions C , D , and E derive from edition B rather than from edition A , since at this point all three editions are like B in including line 39 on C3. Likewise the three 1670 editions follow B in omitting the couplet appearing in A on G1 v , ll. 26-27 (314: 26-27), and the three lines in the prologue. C , D , and E retain the improved readings of the couplets on D4 and H2. The stage-direction on D2, l. 19 (293: 16) of edition B , ' Enter Pizarro', is not present in edition A , but is to be found in C , D , and E , as is a line of the text first added in edition B on I4 v , l. 30 (333:40), Alm. When that is forc'd there yet remain two more. Even though as a group C , D , and E are alike and are demonstrably based ultimately upon B as a copy-text, there are enough differences in the three editions to indicate their respective derivations and their order. It is possible first to separate editions D and E as a group distinct from edition C . In editions B and C on B4 v , 1. 6 (283:11), the line, My love I dare not, ev'n in whispers breath, is misprinted in D and E as My love I dare even in whispers breath. A similar change is to be seen on G4 v , l. 38 (318: 12), where C and earlier editions read, Alas, it was not new! too late I see, but D and E have, Alas, it was new! too too late I see. These are but a few of the many cases in which editions D and E depart from the text of C . Often there is a change in pronoun. Where C and earlier editions read, 'our Monarch', D and E have 'your Monarch', C3, l. 15 (286:7). 'Your' of C is changed to 'you' in D and E on C4 v , l. 30 (289:10). In both instances the context shows that the readings of editions D and E are erroneous, but the errors make reasonably good sense and thus would not be subject to proof-correction except by an extremely careful editor. It is likewise possible to distinguish edition E from edition D . In many places where D agrees with C , edition E shows a deterioration of the text. The opening words of l. 23 on sig. D3 (293:21) of editions C , D , and the preceding texts are, 'Men can', but in E these are changed to 'Man can'. On D4, l. 34 (295:27), 'from your', of C , D , and earlier editions becomes 'from our', in edition E . On F1, l. 1 (306:1), editions A-C read, 'SCENE III. Mexico '. Edition D has 'SCENE III, Mexico '; but edition E has only 'SCENE III.' The stage-direction on G3 v , l. 19 (317:34), reading ' Souldiers shout, A Guyomar.' in editions A-D becomes in edition E , ' Souldiers shout , Guyomar.' It is thus evident that edition E is last in the series of editions C , D , and E . If all other proof were lacking that this is so, one circumstance alone would be sufficient evidence to indicate strongly the posteriority of edition E . Editions C and D follow the preceding editions in ending sig. K1 v with line 38 (334:5), but edition E has 39 lines on that page, drawing the extra line from the top of the next page, K2. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that edition E should have come first or in an intermediate position in the series of 1670 editions. Nor could editions D or E have been derived from B independently of C . There are too many cases in which major changes in the text of the play are to be found initially in C , changes which are repeated by editions D and E . In fact, edition C presents much evidence of extensive re-editing. Although edition C contains no statement like that in edition B concerning the changes made in the text by Dryden, one is led to suspect that the author was responsible for the emendations to be seen in the 1670 editions. Dryden had stated in his introductory remarks to "A Defence" that: As for the more material faults of writing, which are properly mine, though I see many of them, I want leisure to amend them. It is entirely possible that between 1668 and 1670, when the third edition appeared, Dryden found time to go over the play quite carefully and to make numerous corrections in the diction and meter which for the most part seem to enhance considerably the literary value of the play. That Dryden, rather than some other editor, was responsible for the emendations is probable, not only because of the nature and extent of the corrections, but also because of the early date in the history of the play itself. In 1670 Dryden was still closely associated with his publisher, Henry Herringman, and it is extremely unlikely that the latter should have sought the services of another for such a task if Dryden were readily available to him. A few examples will suffice to indicate the nature of the changes made in the text by the editor of edition C . In editions A and B lines 2-3 on B2 v (279:26-27), reading, My birth I to that injur'd Princess owe, Whom his hard heart not only love deny'd, appear in C as, My birth I to that injur'd Princess owe, To whom not only he his love deny'd. On C2, ll. 3-4 (285:37-38), of editions A and B the couplet, Last, that you leave those Idols you implore, And one true Deity with him adore. becomes in edition C , Last, that you leave those Idols you adore, And one true Deity with pray'rs implore. More extensive changes may be noted in lines 26, 28-29 on C2 v (287:12, 14-15), where It was an act my Honour bound me to, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I could not do it on my Honours score, For Love would now oblige me to do more, are revised in edition C to read, Honour requir'd that Act, ev'n from a Foe, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . That reason which inclin'd my will before Would urge it now, for Love has fir'd it more. Many such revisions of the text are to be found in edition C . If, therefore, the almost inevitable hypothesis that Dryden was the editor of C is correct, then C would seem to be the edition which best represents the state in which the author wished the play to appear in print, and which constitutes the best rendering of the text, for there is no evidence that Dryden corrected any later edition. 7 It is therefore my opinion that edition C presents the best text of the play and that its variants must be considered to be authoritative in constructing the text for a modern edition of The Indian Emperour . Edition F of the play is dated 1681. F omits the extensive revisions of editions C , D , and E and returns to the readings found in B , of which it is a page-for-page reprint. 8 In every case where editions A and B differ, F follows the reading and arrangement of B rather than that of A . 9 Particularly significant is the fact that F , like B , ends sig. C3 with line 39 instead of line 38, as does A . Nor does F print the couplet on G1 v or the three lines in the prologue omitted by B . It is thus evident that B was the copy-text for F . 10 Edition G , dated 1686, in turn uses edition F as a copy-text. Although G for the first time breaks the series of paginal reprints by printing more lines on each page, the edition offers few problems in tracing its textual origin. The correspondence between F and G can be demonstrated clearly in the cases where F introduces new variants. On B4 v , l. 30 (283:36), in edition F the name ' Taxcallan ' of the earlier editions is spelled ' Traxallan ' and appears thus in edition G . In the same line of the text both editions F and G omit the stage-direction, ' Another Enters .' given in editions A-E . On C2, l. 12 (286: 4), 'This Soveraign Lord' of editions A-E is changed in F and G to 'The Soveraign Lord'. Edition F also rewords the line appearing on C3, l. 19 (287:42) in editions A-E as 'storms within my breast' to 'torments in my breast'. Edition G gives the second reading. Edition G was the copy-text for edition H , dated 1692. Most obvious as proof of this is the fact that H is a page-for-page reprint of G . Likewise, variants introduced for the first time by G are repeated by H . In the Latin motto of the title-page, ' Me quoque ,' of editions A-F appears as ' Me quoq ;' in editions G and H . The speech-heading ' High Pr. ' in editions A-F on C4, l. 32 (290:1) and again on C4 v , ll. 17 and 28 (290:23 and 34), is in editions G and H printed ' H. Priest .' 11 Edition I , 1694, again introduces a compressed makeup in the series of editions, further reducing the number of pages needed to print the play. However, I presents a much more intricate problem regarding its immediate source. In certain details it is very similar to edition H , which normally would be expected as the copy-text, but in other particulars edition I returns to the earlier readings of edition G not shared by H . Unless a lost edition intervenes (an unlikely contingency), the most probable explanation of the variants in edition I is that I was printed from both G and H , with two compositors setting copy simultaneously or consecutively, one using G as copy-text, the other H . 12 A remote possibility that I was printed from either G or H with press-corrections being made from the alternate copy is not demonstrable. In any case, if setting were simultaneous, the fact that H is a paginal reprint of G would materially aid the accurate casting off of copy in order that omissions or overlappings of texts might not occur and the amount of copy allotted to each compositor should exactly fill the space for which it was intended. 13 Exactly what conditions prevailed concerning the double copy-text for edition I may not be stated categorically beyond the fact that the edition does reflect both G and H . 14 Three editions of the play, J, K , and L , are dated 1696, and again the problem of order is raised. All three editions follow the paginal arrangement of edition I , thus indicating that one or all three of the 1696 editions used I as a copy-text. However, edition J is closer textually to edition I than are editions K and L. Examples of the close relationship between I and J may be seen in instances where I and J are the same while K and L display new variants. On A2 v , l. 10 (271: 32) 'farther off' in editions I and J becomes 'further off' in K and L . Again on the same page, l. 15 (272: 1), 'Wines' in I and J is changed to 'Vines' in K and L . On C3, l. 4 (290: 15) 'thy land' in editions I and J reads in editions K and L 'the land'. Similarly 'such ease' on E3 v , l. 19 (310: 5) of editions I and J is changed in K and L to 'thy ease'. Nor were K and L derived from I independently of edition J . There are too many minor, but significant, variants which appear for the first time in edition J and are repeated in turn by editions K and L to admit this possibility. Of these but one is necessary to show the relative order of editions J , K , and L . Actually the passage in question contains several interdependent variants arising from an error of interpretation by the compositor of edition J . The variants are to be found on F2, ll. 15, 17, and 21 (315:21, 23, and 27). The first of these lines in edition A is assigned two lines above to Alibech and reads, Odmar I come to tell you pleasing News, and editions B through H repeat the line with but one change, the insertion of a comma after ' Odmar '. In edition I , however, the comma is replaced with a period. Edition J uses the same punctuation as I . But editions K and L abbreviate ' Odmar ' to ' Odm. ' and print the line as if ' Odm. ' were a speech-heading. That the compositor of edition J thought the ' Odmar. ' of line 15 was a speech-heading is made evident by his treatment of the speech-heading which follows on line 17. In the early editions A-I , line 17 and the three following lines are assigned correctly to Odmar, but the compositor of J , mistaking ' Odmar. ' in line 15 for a speech-heading and finding that this resulted in the assignment of two consecutive speeches to Odmar, substituted for the second ' Odm. ' the abbreviation ' Alib. ' This in turn resulted in his having two consecutive speech-headings for Alibech, the second appearing on line 21 in edition I . Therefore he omitted the ' Alib. ' of line 21 in an attempt to solve his difficulties. The dependence of editions K and L upon J is shown by the fact that these two editions copied the error made by the compositor of J , and on line 17 print ' Alib. ' and omit the speech-heading on line 21. It is extremely unlikely that all three compositors should have arrived at the same solution of the problem independently. Although editions K and L are in most instances identical, there are enough differences in the two editions to indicate their order. On B3 v , ll. 17-18 (282: 42-43) of edition J appears the couplet, Time best will show whose services will last. Odm. Then judge my future service by my past. The couplet is the same in edition K , but in edition L the same lines read, Time best will show whose service will last. Odm. Then judge my future services by my past. The transposition of the singular and plural forms of 'service' makes both lines irregular in meter. It might be argued that L may have been the copy-text for K and that the compositor of K noticing the irregularity corrected the two lines. However, on the same page, B3 v , l. 37 (283: 19) edition L spells the possessive form of an Indian name ' Taxalla's '. All the earlier editions A-K spell the same name ' Traxalla's '. In line 33 above (283: 15), editions J, K , and L erroneously spell the same name ' Taxalla's ', in place of the correct form, ' Traxalla's ', as it appears in all the earlier editions. If K had used L as a copy-text, it would appear exceedingly strange that the compositor should have returned to the original form of the word in line 37 after having spelled it without the r in line 33. That edition L is last in the series J, K, L is also shown by the many instances where in this edition alone appear variants which do not particularly affect the meaning of the lines and which therefore would be less subject to correction. This is especially true of several lines on sig. D2. Here in lines 35, 37, and 43 (297: 35, 37, and 43) edition L has 'passion . . . bring . . . mean', whereas the corresponding words in the earlier texts of the play read, 'Passions . . . brings . . . meant'. The stage-direction on D4, l. 22 (301:40) of edition L reads, 'Guyomar returns and beats them .' This is a radical, but understandable rendition, considering the appearance of the type, of the stage-direction in editions A-K reading, 'Guyomar returns and hears them .' The First Folio of Dryden's plays was published by Jacob Tonson in 1701. Apparently the copy-text for the Folio was J , one of the 1696 editions. Although the number of variants common only to J and the Folio is small, there are enough to establish a direct relationship between the two editions. On sig. Q1, l. 38 (290:4) the Folio repeats a misprint made only in edition J where the couplet, Who Visions dress in pleasing Colour still, Set all the Good to show, and hid the Ill: reads 'hide the ill' in all other editions. Similar is the repetition in the Folio on R3 v , l. 13 (310:5), of a line in edition J , Thou shall not at such ease receive thy Doom which all other editions render correctly as, Thou shalt not at such ease receive thy Doom. 15 In addition to these unique agreements there occur in the Folio variants which are found only in editions J, K , and L , and which point definitely to J as the copy-text because the Folio is like K and L only when K and L agree with J . 16 The Folio agrees with J, K , and L in printing the stage-direction ' To Montez.' following line 45 on P2 (281:5) while all other earlier editions print the same stage-direction at the end of the preceding line of text. Likewise, on Q1, l. 18 (289: 27) of the Folio 'along', a misprint for 'a long' in all other editions, is to be found only in J, K , and L . A somewhat similar error in J, K , and L is to be seen on the same page, l. 33 (289: 42) where these editions add to the line a word not in the earlier editions, making it read, Doom as they please with my Empire not to stand. Here 'with' is the superfluous word which not only makes the line hypermetrical but also obscures its meaning. 17 Nevertheless the case for J as the copy-text of the Folio is not entirely indisputable. There are certain points where the Folio rejects the readings of edition J for those of an earlier edition. One such case is to be seen on sig. Q2 v , l. 42 (295: 2), where the Folio reads, Where hast thou been since first the Fight began, as do editions A-H . But editions I-L omit the word 'first'. Again on R1 v , l. 22 (303: 34) the line, Vasquez , the trusty Slave with you retain, appears thus correctly in editions A-G , and the Folio, but reads, Vasquez , the trusty Slave which you retain, in editions H-L . Nor does the Folio repeat the errors made in the speech-headings which were so valuable above in establishing the relationship between editions I, J, K , and L . Instead the Folio here is like editions B-H . Unfortunately there is no sure test which can be used to point definitely to the one early edition as the source of these correct readings. However, by a process of elimination, it can be determined with a fair amount of confidence that edition G was used occasionally to make corrections in the text of J . The corrections occur so rarely and with such irregularity as to make untenable the hypothesis that G might have been used alternately with J as a copy-text. It is more likely that a hasty or sketchy attempt at editing the text may have been made at the time the Folio was printed. But even though these earlier variants are to be found in the Folio, the evidence is preponderantly upon the side of edition J as its immediate copy-text.</field>

Montague Summers, (London: Nonesuch Press, 1931), I, 255. 6 The page and line references in parentheses are to the edition of Montague Summers. Summers did not number lines within scenes and acts. Signature and line references are those of the editions under discussion. 7 Edition C was overlooked by Scott-Saintsbury and by Summers as contributing authoritative variants to the text of the play. Owing to the subsequent history of the text, the variants in C , although they are repeated in D and E , did not appear in later editions, all of which stem from F (1681), which in turn goes back to B . 8 Why F used B as a copy-text rather than the vastly superior edition C is a matter for conjecture. Normally we should expect the more recent edition to furnish copy for a new one. Since this was not done, the question arises whether a copy of C , D , or E was available to the printer, or if one were at hand, why Herringman preferred the text of B . As Dr. Bowers has suggested to me, the explanation may probably lie in the fact that edition B contained "A Defence" and that therefore B might have been preserved for the purpose of furnishing a text in case it were ever considered expedient to reprint the essay in later editions. 9 There are several instances in which F follows readings appearing in C , D , and E but which are not present in some copies of B . But in every case press-corrected copies of B contain these variants and are thus the source not only for the variants in C , D , and E , but also for those in F as well. 10 One minor, but very significant detail in the printing of F shows its neglect of CDE as copy-texts. Edition B , like A , prints the epilogue of the play on two pages, sigs. K3 and K3 v ; but CDE on sig. K4 only. F again uses K3 and K3 v , with the last seven lines of the epilogue, as in A and B , on K3 v . 11 There are two major differences between editions G and H. G prints the epilogue at the end of the play; H on the verso of the page bearing the prologue. In G , as in the earlier editions, the dedication is in italic type; in H this appears in roman. 12 It was conventional for two compositors to work in relay, each following his own counted-off copy-text. For a demonstration of this method, see Philip Williams, "The Compositor of the Pied-Bull Lear," Papers of the Bibliographical Society, University of Virginia , I (1948-49), 59 ff . 13 If I was set from both G and H the question may be raised why each compositor was not given one half of the text to set while the other was at work upon the second half. As has been noted, the collation of I differs considerably from that of editions G and H , necessitating an extremely accurate casting off of copy, a task not impossible, but one which would have resulted in delaying the printing process. However, if only one press were employed, the compositors would need to set in relay. 14 According to the appearance in edition I of variants which can with certainty be traced to the earlier editions, sigs. B1, C1, C4 v , D3, D3 v , D4, D4 v , F1, F2 v , F3 v , G2, G4 v , H2 v , H3, I1, and I1 v , of edition G were used as copy-text for edition I . The dedication, the epilogue, and sigs. B2, D2, E2, E3, and E3 v of edition H were used for the corresponding passages of edition I . Because of the mixed condition of the text of edition I elsewhere, it is impossible to point definitely to either one or the other edition as copy-text for I for other pages. 15 As noted above, K and L read 'thy' for 'such.' 16 There is one exception to this general statement. The Folio spells the name 'Traxalla' thus on Q1 v , l. 1 (290: 32), as do all editions but J and K , which misprint it 'Taxalla'. However, the spelling of this name is not a good test in the Folio, since it regularly has 'Traxalla' no matter what the other editions read. 17 The edition made by Summers also has the superfluous 'with', and this, together with many other instances in which his text and that of the Folio are in accord to the neglect of more authoritative readings, indicates that the Folio was probably the copy-text for his modern edition in spite of his misleading claims for early authority.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Bibliographical Evidence from the Printer's Measure * by Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TYPOGRAPHICAL MEASUREMENTS HAVE always been of important service in bibliography, as instance the basic uses for identification to which incunabulists put the measurement of twenty lines of type. The present study is not concerned, however, with measurements of type for the purposes of identifying fonts held by printers, but instead with certain inferences which the investigator of the presswork of sixteenth and seventeenth-century books may draw on occasion from identifying the length of the printer's stick, or measure—sometimes, but not always, in conjunction with alterations in the overall type-page opening in the skeleton-formes of a particular book. This study is confined almost exclusively to Restoration play quartos, but only because I have been working closely with these for several years and have been able to keep records of measurements in some hundreds of books. Except for the final section devoted to the identification of compositors setting in relay, there is perhaps nothing very new in the evidence advanced; but since no formal study has, I think, been made of this kind of evidence, it is perhaps useful to bring together in one place a maximum of information even though some part of it is familiar to most analytical bibliographers. In his stick, or measure, the compositor set the type from his cases, and from this stick he transferred as convenient a series of composed lines to his page-galley. In setting a mixture of verse and prose, he often used two measures, one short and one long, the longer being the full width of his type-page. Which measure was used to set any given line may have considerable textual significance, as Mr. George Williams has shown in this present volume in his "A Note on King Lear , III.ii.1-3." 1 In early times this compositor's stick was made in various fixed lengths, but at some indeterminate period before Moxon's treatise the adjustable stick came into use. It is generally believed that with the adjustable stick, at any rate, and probably with standard widths of the fixed stick, the compositor owned his own measure. Whether this is an absolute fact is not essential for the present argument, but it may be remarked that close examination of a number of Restoration play quartos does not disclose the interchange of measures between compositors during the course of setting books where variant measures may be identified. Whether fixed or adjustable, sticks were likely to vary among themselves by as much as two millimeters even when intended to be used in setting the same width of type-page. This is understandable when the difficulties are taken into account either of two compositors adjusting their sticks identically or of the artisan carving two wooden fixed sticks to give an absolutely precise opening for each. This small variation in the long measure was of little consequence in the printing. It was too small to be seen by the eye, and it did not prevent type-pages composed in two such variable sticks from being imposed in the same skeleton-formes: the wedges seem easily to have taken up the difference and provided equal pressure within any portion of the forme. There would be a limit of tolerance, of course. My observation has been that up to about two millimeters difference may be taken as normal, although I have seen measures varying up to three millimeters used in setting type for the same formes: when more widely variant measures are found, one will usually discover that different skeleton-formes contain the type-pages of such unequal width. Measuring to detect these variant sticks is not always easy. The bibliographer must take account of the fact that different letters were cast on different parts of the body of the type and that he must choose roughly similar letters at the beginning and end of successively measured lines if he is not to be thrown off by non-significant variation of as much as a millimeter. This is important, for often he must work with variance between two compositor's sticks of as little as a single millimeter. Moreover, the measurement of no one line on a page can be trusted to identify accurately the stick used for that page owing to the fact that compositors seem frequently to have justified a line by a final thin space. Catchwords alone are the least trustworthy of all, and should not be employed except in cases of necessity: my observation has been that justifying by means of a thin space after the catchword was a fairly common operation. Finally, owing to the variable tightness with which the quarters of the forme could be locked up by the wedges, some normal differential, usually of about a millimeter, is often encountered between type-pages set in the same stick. These are severe difficulties, and for some pages are often serious enough to make measurement untrustworthy when variation between sticks is slight and the compositors did not set according to a reasonably fixed pattern. The most elementary and easily discerned cases which can be determined by measurement occur when (a) a book is divided in half between two compositors and each simultaneously sets his portion; (b) printing of a book is so materially interrupted that when work is resumed a different measure is inadvertently employed. When running-titles are present, the basic fact of division is ordinarily demonstrable without requiring the evidence of measurement except as a corroboration. A book in which one complete portion is printed with a certain set or sets of running-titles and another portion with a completely different set or sets has manifestly been printed in different skeleton-formes. However, these books are useful for demonstrating the validity of the evidence provided by the printer's measure since the two portions are not always set with a different number of lines per page or with a different font. Moreover, the measure alone can sometimes decide whether (a) or (b) above obtained with a given book. A typical example is John Crowne's Calisto (1675), in which simultaneous two-section printing is demonstrated by the faulty casting-off of copy which resulted in the second press beginning with sheet H although subsequently the first press concluded its section with sheet F. This simultaneous setting and printing is also indicated by the running-titles, which are in lower-case in sheets B-F but in full capitals in sheets H-L. Although the font remains the same, the measurement of the type-page in the first section is 36 lines, 169(182) x 113, 94R, and of the second section 38 lines, 179(190) x 109 mm. Running-titles are not always present, however, to indicate such a division, and in these cases the type-page measurement may be the only available evidence. Thus in Abraham Bailey's The Spightful Sister (1667), which is without running-titles, one observes that the text in sheets B-E is set with a printer's measure of 113 mm., but from sig. F1 to the end of the book on sig. 14 v the measure jumps to 130 mm. A question often arises whether a book has been simultaneously set in two sections, or whether the break between two portions, as indicated by the type measurement, is only a sign of an interruption in the seriatim printing, or else of another compositor taking over not necessarily after a delay. In some cases the same sets of running-titles, and thus the same skeleton-formes, continue regularly throughout a book although at one point there is a shift in the measure which indicates composition by a different workman. A typical book is Peter Bellon's The Mock-Duellist (1675), which is printed with two skeleton-formes per sheet, these same two skeletons being maintained throughout; yet sheets B-F are set with a 120 mm. measure and sheets G-I with a measure of 121 mm. In such a book the inference is probably that with sheet G another compositor, who intended to set his stick to the same measure, took over the work. In general, one is likely to conjecture that any interruption of the printing sufficient to cause a single compositor to adjust his stick again after working on some other book would most likely have been sufficient to cause the skeleton-formes to be broken up—but in many books only the conjecture is possible. However, there is a kind of evidence which can be used decisively in two-section books without running-titles or in books where a change in running-titles and thus in skeleton-formes indicates the possibility either of simultaneous two-section printing or else of a marked interruption in the printing. In a first edition, especially, the normal inference is usually that separate preliminaries were printed as the final operation. For certain first editions reasonable demonstration of this fact can be made, as when an errata list is present in the preliminaries, or when the text begins on A1 or else on B1 but with preliminaries occupying more than one gathering. In some two-section books the evidence is singularly neat. Thus in Calisto , mentioned above, the three-sheet preliminaries signed A 4 a-b 4 were set in the 109 mm. measure used to print sheets H-L but not B-F, and thus one can safely infer what the signing would lead one to expect, that these sheets were machined after the last sheet of the text had been wrought off, in this case by the second press. There is still an ambiguity in such books, however, for this pattern could also result when there had been an interruption, or when without interruption a second workman or press had been substituted. 2 When, on the other hand, in a two-section book one finds that the compositor setting the first section also set the preliminaries, somewhat less question can arise, for unless the preliminaries were set and printed first, this allocation of composition could result only when a book was simultaneously printed. In Thomas Southerne's Oroonoko (1696), for instance, the text begins on B and the preliminaries are confined to sheet A. On sig. E1 we find the measure changing from the 111 mm. of sheets B-D to the 113 mm. measure of sheets E-M. Here the case at first sight is not certain, since the markedly unequal division of the book seems to militate against simultaneous setting in two sections; and lacking other evidence one might be led to suspect that the appearance of the 111 mm. measure in sheet A should be accounted for by the view that the preliminaries were printed first, even though the book is a first edition. Yet other evidence suggests simultaneous printing. 3 On the other hand, when a book seems to have been broken rather neatly in half between two compositors, and the compositor of the first section set the separate preliminaries, the evidence is all in favor of simultaneous printing. This is the case with The Spightful Sister , where the text division is B-E and F-I, or four sheets to each compositor, with half-sheet A set by the first. Another example is Rochester's Valentinian (1685), divided B-G and H-M, the three sheets of the preliminaries also being set by the compositor of the B-G section. Some rather odd books offer the most positive evidence. Occasionally in two-section simultaneous printing one press would assist the other in cleaning up the job. A first-rate example is John Crowne's The Married Beau (1694) in which the text division is B-F, the type-page measuring 46 lines, 187(198) x 108 mm.; and G-K, the type-page being 47 lines, 190(201) x 115 mm. Gathering F consists of three leaves, the fourth having been excised. The preliminaries require the four-leaf sheet signed A plus an unsigned disjunct fifth leaf. When we find sheet A set with the 115 mm. measure used for G-K, but the disjunct preliminary leaf set with the 108 mm. measure used in B-F, and when we also find that the pagination of the book skips from 38 on F3 v to 41 on G1, the case is clear. The book was simultaneously printed in two parts, with the second press printing sheet A but the first press machining the odd preliminary leaf as F4, its text copy not being sufficiently extensive to fill the four leaves of final sheet F. Another and more complicated example is found in Thomas Southerne's The Disappointment (1684) in which the original assignment to two presses had been text sheets B-E and F-I. Gathering E is composed of three leaves, the first two conjugate and set in the measure used for sheets F-I; but sig. E3, disjunct, is set in the different measure used for B-D and also for preliminary sheet A, this last having its fourth leaf excised. The highly irregular gathering E has been mistaken for a cancellans, but a rather complex chain of bibliographical evidence can be constructed to show that the first press was delayed in its printing between sheets C and D, and though gathering E had originally been assigned to it (the second section clearly having started printing with F), to finish the book expeditiously the second press swung over after printing sheet I and the two presses joined to print E. The second press machined E1.2 by half-sheet imposition while the first press was printing sig. E3 in the A4 position of the preliminaries. 4 Evidence as to the measure becomes more difficult when the preliminaries consist only of a disjunct title-leaf or a half-sheet with preliminary text set in a short measure. However, records I have kept of several hundred books show that in most cases the title-page was set in the same stick used for the text (or for the rest of the preliminaries), and thus that its measure will ordinarily be the same. When, in order to give room for large display type, the title seems to have been set directly in page galley and with an abnormally wide measure, often one will find, as in Dryden's The Indian Emperour (1681), that the imprint has been composed in the printer's text stick and therefore can be compared with the measure in other parts of the book. In other cases when the whole title and imprint seem to have been set in a longer stick than that used elsewhere in the book, preliminaries like dedications, forewords, dramatis personæ, and so on will usually conform in measure to one or other section of the text. If, on the contrary, as in John Bancroft's Henry the Second (1693), the separate preliminaries and title are set in a different measure from the text, we may suppose—according to their nature—either that they were set last after some delay or, as with the second edition of Dryden's The Spanish Fryar (1686), that setting of the book began with the preliminaries but a larger measure was employed to squeeze rather extensive material into one sheet. In reverse, we find Dryden's The Rival Ladies (1693), the title, preliminaries, and first two pages of text (B2-2 v ) set in a 117 mm. measure, but on B3 the measure shifting to the 126 mm. used thereafter. Sometimes rather interesting facts about the printing may be deduced from the study of the printer's stick. The first edition of Thomas Shadwell's The Squire of Alsatia (1688) shows a printer beginning with the typographical plan of a page measuring 38 lines, 176(189) x 110, 93.6R, and setting sigs. B1-C1 v according to this layout. Then, since the play is a long one, he apparently felt the need to expand his page to save paper and presswork, and set C2-4 v as 39 lines, 180(194) x 115 mm. 5 Presumably he then found the page too crowded, since with sig. D1 he kept the longer measure but settled on 38 lines and the original vertical type-page opening of 176(189) mm. The anonymous play The Triumphs of Virtue (1697) is unfortunately without the running-titles which might assist in solving its printing, but the facts of its typography may supply some bases for conjecture. The book is a quarto signed A-H 4 and paged 1-4 57 68-40 33-55 56 [=64]. The pagination numerals in the headlines are in smaller type in sheets E-H than in A-D. The type-page in A-D measures 44 lines, 182(193) x 108, 82.6R; that in sheet E, 44 lines, 178(188) x 113, 80.8R; that in F-H, 47 lines, 192(202) x 118, 80.1R. The pagination suggests that the book was originally planned to be split between two presses in sections A-E and F-H, and that the second press beginning with sig. F1 paged it 33 on the assumption that pagination would start with page 1 on sig. B1, whereas in fact it begins on sig. A3 with page 5. Although one might be tempted to conjecture that the smaller font was adopted by the first compositor in order to compress into the single sheet E rather more copy than had been allowed for in the casting-off, the change in the measure and also in the whole type-page opening (thus presumably in the skeleton-formes) militates against this view. Since the size of the pagination figures in the headlines associates sheet E, instead, with imposition by the compositor of the second section, one might apply the same theory to him, but again the measurements do not encourage this attempt. One fact is clear, at any rate: although sheet E had originally been assigned to the first press, actually the second compositor imposed it, the machining taking place after the conclusion of the F-H section (as indicated by the pagination). One may possibly speculate that the completely different typography of sheet E, showing the construction of a new skeleton-forme, may have resulted from the confusion of the pagination between the two sections, so that when the first compositor came to page 40 (D4 v ) he believed he had joined the two sections of the book, since sheet F of press two began with page 41. Only very much later, when the sheets were actually collated—perhaps even for binding—was it discovered that a sheet of text had, in truth, not been set, and thus sheet E may have been composed and printed at a considerably later time to complete the book, certainly at a time after the original skeleton-formes had been broken up. Important as it is for a study of the presswork to identify the compositors of two or more contiguous sections of a book, one of the more striking examples of the usefulness of the printer's measure occurs when this evidence assists in identifying the compositor and also the place of printing for cancels and other separate material originally imposed elsewhere in one forme. Under most circumstances the evidence of the measure alone is not decisive, but certainly a study of cancels shows that the odds are against any material added to a book at a later date than the original printing being set in an identical type-page opening, but more especially in precisely the same measure. 6 Thus the fact that the measure of cancellans leaf G1 in Dryden's The Indian Emperour (1667) is that for the rest of the book assists in the belief that it was printed as leaf K4, missing in the seven recorded American copies. Just so, the measure makes it a certainty (evidence of running-titles here assisting) that disjunct sig. E3 of Southerne's The Disappointment was printed by the first press as leaf A4 and excised from the preliminaries to be bound in its proper position. Similarly, although in this case the fact can be proved by an aberrant copy, there would have been strong reason to conjecture that the 1681 cancel title-leaf for Crowne's The Misery of Civil War (1680), which transformed it into the reissue Henry the Sixth: The Second Part , was printed as leaf K4 of Henry the Sixth: The First Part (1681) since the cancel title was set to the 114 mm. measure used in that book. For these reasons Dr. Philip Williams in his "The 'Second Issue' of Troilus and Cressida , 1609," earlier in this present volume, found the fact that the cancel fold in the quarto was printed in the same measure as the text very comforting to buttress the evidence of the running-titles that this same fold, and not a part of some other book, was the material which was undoubtedly printed in the same formes with half-sheet M. We come, finally, to an unexplored and difficult use of the measure as bibliographical evidence. As Dr. Charlton Hinman first demonstrated, 7 his results later being confirmed by Dr. Philip Williams, 8 spelling tests can be applied with some certainty to distinguish the work of different compositors setting a book seriatim in relay. In this connection, the printer's measure can usefully be employed on some fortunate occasions as powerful corroborative evidence, and it may even become primary evidence when on disputed pages the spelling tests are ambiguous or when, as in the later seventeenth century, the growing uniformity of spelling may make spelling tests of doubtful value. The prime difficulty of the evidence of the measure lies in the fact that when the two sticks were not in perfect adjustment, the variation between them is sometimes no more than one millimeter, although less difficulty is encountered when the variation is two millimeters or the seeming maximum three millimeters. 9 Moreover, uneven shrinkage in the paper may cause apparent variation to upset one's calculations, as well as uneven pressure from the wedges. As a test of the validity of this evidence, I chose of the three quartos analyzed by Dr. Williams those two which are available in photographic reproduction, Shakespeare's 'Pied Bull' Lear (1608), 10 and Robert Armin's The History of the Two Maids of More-clack (1609), 11 both printed by Nicholas Okes. Within a slight non-significant variation without pattern and apparently dependent on the tightness of the wedges, the short and long measures in Lear of 80 and 93 mm. are constantly maintained, and this corresponds with Dr. Williams's spelling evidence demonstrating beyond all question that only one of Okes's two compositors set this play. In The Two Maids of More-clack Dr. Williams found that the usual pattern was for compositor B to set $1-2 v of each sheet, and compositor A $3-4 v . Measurements disclose that compositor B used a measure of 88-89 mm. whereas compositor A used a measure of 90-91 mm. From sheet C on, these measures coincide precisely with the identification of the two compositors by spelling tests save in the two instances, sigs. H3 and H4 v , where Dr. Williams felt the trend of the spelling evidence enforced breaking the pattern and assigning H3 and H4 v to compositor B , although they would normally have constituted part of A 's assignment. Since in both these pages the 90-91 mm. measure indicates that A actually set these pages and that the regular pattern was maintained in this sheet, the evidence of the printer's stick proves a useful counterweight as a check on spelling tests in cases of doubt. Although the check of measure against spelling as an identification is invariable in sheets C-I except for these two pages, there is some difficulty in sheets A and B; 12 nevertheless, the consistency with which the evidence of the measure operates in the other seven and a half sheets in the book demonstrates that it can be highly effective. Some results accrue when the evidence of the measure is applied to Restoration play quartos where spelling tests would be doubtful. Crowne's The Country Wit (1693) is a difficult book because it is hard to decide whether certain variations of a millimeter in one compositor's measure are non-significant, or whether they represent the stick of a third compositor. If we take the more difficult but probable view that three compositors were associated with this book, we find that compositor I with a measure of 120-121 mm. set both formes of sheet A (which contains text as well as prelims) and then dropped out for two sheets. Compositor II , with a measure of 122 mm., then took over and set both formes of sheet B. The third compositor III , with a measure of 123 mm. seems to have set C1-2, and thereupon II and III alternate, II apparently setting C2 v -3 v , III C4, and II C4 v . Compositor I returns to set both formes of sheet D, followed by II setting both formes of sheet E. Compositor III , enters with F1-2 and F4-4 v , II interposing with F2 v -3. Compositor I set G1-3 v and perhaps the rest of G although II seems to have composed G4 and just possibly G4 v . Gathering H, very curiously (since this is a second edition), is only a single leaf and is set by III . Perhaps there was confusion in imposition even though the pagination is continuous: it may be significant that with the re-entrance of compositor I on G1 the two skeletons which had printed each sheet of the book exchange their formes in sheet G, this arrangement carrying over to sheet I. At any rate, compositor II set I1-2 v and III concluded the book with I3-4 v . I cannot guarantee the absolute accuracy of every page of this assignment since the tolerances are sometimes very fine between compositors II and III ; but this is what I make of the Harvard copy, and I am inclined to believe that a pattern develops which is accurate in the main and which is not inconsonant with a reasonably exact identification of compositors. In the Harvard copy the paper of sheets D and G, set by compositor I , seems to differ from that in the rest of the book. From several other plays Thomas D'Urfey's A Fond Husband (1677) may be selected. Here a fairly regular pattern is established of about four to five type-pages apiece between two compositors in relay using measures of 112 mm. and 113 mm. respectively. This play is especially interesting because, although it is a first edition and thus set from manuscript, the evidence of the measure seems to indicate that for the first two text sheets (possibly to get formes as quickly as possible at the start to the waiting press or presses) the compositors cast off copy and set by formes. Thus the 112 mm. measure set the outer formes of sheets B and C, and the 113 mm. measure the inner formes. Thereupon they begin to alternate, the 113 mm. measure beginning by composing most of sheet D, both formes. The evidential value of the measure is not invariable for there are numerous books almost certainly set by two compositors whose sticks were so nearly equalized that measurement cannot distinguish them. Negatively, therefore, the evidence must always be equated with that of the presswork as shown by running-titles, or as Allan Stevenson has demonstrated, 13 by watermarks, before an invariant measure may be taken as indicating the presence of only one compositor, spelling tests not having been applied. 14 When, however, positive evidence is available that two measures were used in the composition of a book, the analytical bibliographer may find the information thus gained to be of considerable value in any number of unsuspected ways to which his ingenuity may lead him. 15</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * The investigation of the material in this article was made under grants from the Research Council of the Richmond Area University Center and the Research Committee of the University of Virginia for the writing of a descriptive bibliography of the Restoration Drama. 1 In these same lines further bibliographical evidence, which did not concern his argument, may be adduced from the measure. Much of the discussion as to the nature of the copy behind this passage in the quarto, found in G. I. Duthie, Shakespeare's King Lear: A Critical Edition (1949), pp. 96-99 quoting Hubler and Greg, is vitiated by the fact that the compositor could not have begun to set the opening lines as prose and decided to line it as verse only in the fourth line: since the first three lines are clearly justified in the short, or verse measure, never used in this play for prose, the natural inference is that he began to set them as verse and the mislineation must be accounted for by other means. 2 For example, in Bellon's Mock-Duellist , mentioned above, the preliminaries were set by the second workman, who was conjectured to have substituted for the first towards the end of the book but without interrupting printing. 3 Watermark evidence may be useful in two-section printing. In Oroonoko a different watermark appears in sheets A-D from that in E-M. This watermark division might also develop if there had been an interruption between D and E, but when, as here, no indication of such a work stoppage is found, the evidence rather supports the hypothesis that two presses simultaneously printing different parts of the book had different lots of paper laid out for them. 4 This interesting book is analyzed in detail in my "The Supposed Cancel in Southerne's The Disappointment Reconsidered," forthcoming in The Library . 5 This alteration in the type-page opening would require adjustment of the furniture in three of the quarters in both the formes. Just possibly another compositor cut in here. 6 However, these odds occasionally come up. For example, the reset cancellans title for the Bentley-Chapman reissue of the Knight-Saunders 1687 edition of Davenant's adaptation of Macbeth is set in the same measure as the original title although it could not have been printed as a part of the original sheets. This is most uncharacteristic for a separately machined reset cancellans leaf. 7 "Principles Governing the Use of Variant Spellings as Evidence of Alternate Setting by Two Compositors," The Library , 4th ser., XXI (1940), 78-94. 8 "The Compositor of the 'Pied Bull' Lear ," Papers of the Bibliographical Society, University of Virginia , I (1948-49), 61-68. 9 As indicated above, these tolerances were sufficient to go undetected, and type-pages set in such slightly varying measures could readily be imposed in the same skeleton-formes, the wedges taking up the slack and making no adjustment of the furniture necessary. 10 Shakespeare Quarto Facsimiles No. 1 (Shakespeare Association: London, 1939). 11 Tudor Facsimile Texts (London, 1913). 12 Dr. Williams divides sheet A irregularly, assigning A1 v -2 and A3 v -4 v to compositor A , and the remaining A1 and A2 v -3 to compositor B . This might look suspiciously like castingoff copy and setting by formes (if A4 v could be transferred to B , but the 90-91 mm. measure found in all eight type-pages would indicate that compositor A set this sheet entire; and on close examination Dr. Williams's spelling criteria are seen to be somewhat indefinite for the pages assigned to B . Real trouble occurs in sheet B, however, which Dr. Williams divides between the two compositors in the regular manner found in subsequent sheets. Yet with the exception of sig. B3 where the measure is perhaps doubtful and could be that of compositor A , the measure of B3-4 v is certainly 88-89 mm. and therefore associated with compositor B , who had definitely set B1-2 v in this same measure, the spelling tests agreeing for these earlier pages. I do not pretend to be able to explain this aberration, since in the disputed pages the spelling very strongly suggests compositor A . I hesitate to conjecture that in this one instance (as possibly in the preceding sheet if the spelling tests there are really precise) the stick passed from hand to hand, but perhaps it did. 13 "New Uses of Watermarks as Bibliographical Evidence," Papers of the Bibliographical Society, University of Virginia , I (1948-49), 151-182. Printing by two presses must necessarily require the services of two compositors. 14 The determination of the precise spelling criteria which may be used as distinguishing features of the work of two compositors and then the application of these tests to any given book is an extremely onerous task which may on occasion be lightened by at least a tentative assignment of pages between compositors on the evidence of their measures. 15 Since a study of the characteristics of the compositors of a book is necessary before a textual critic can emend with any certainty, the working bibliographer owes it to the critic to analyze a book with the maximum precision in preparing it for criticism. Every available technique should be exploited, therefore, and among these it is possible that in certain cases the extension of the ways in which this evidence of the printer's measure may be employed and the results interpreted will prove of considerable value.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Publication Of Steele's Conscious Lovers by Rodney M. Baine The accessible accounts concerning the publication of Sir Richard Steele's Conscious Lovers are confused and conflicting. These accounts should be clarified, not only because the date of publication is generally incorrectly given but especially because in his interesting current biography Willard Connely unintentionally reflected upon Steele's honesty by showing Sir Richard selling to Lintot rights which he had already sold to the Tonsons: The keen Bernard Lintot, hearing that revivals of both 'The Funeral' and 'The Tender Husband' were in rehearsal at the King's Theatre, darted to Steele's house with 14 gns. in hand for rights to reprint the two old plays. The revival prospered. Lintot strengthened holdings he already possessed in the new comedy forthcoming [ The Conscious Lovers ] by paying Sir Richard £70 more. 1 Although Steele desperately needed cash, he did not sell the same copyright to both the Tonsons and Lintot. Instead, Lintot paid these sums to the Tonsons, not to Steele. 2 In publishing The Conscious Lovers , Steele dealt only with the Tonsons. In the original agreement he assigned the play to Jacob Tonson, Jr., in return for £40 "in hand" and "divers other good Causes and Consideracions": I . . . . Do . . . Sell Assign &amp; Sett over Unto the said Jacob Tonson All that the Sole Right &amp; Title of in &amp; to the Copy of a Comedy Intituled The Fine Gentleman (or The Unfashionable Lover's, or Conscious Lover's,) or by whatever other Name (or Names) the said Comedy shall (or may) be called w oh said Copy of the said Comedy to be &amp; remain Unto the said Jacob Tonson his heires &amp; assigns for ever. In Witness whereof I have herunto Sett my hand &amp; Seal this 20 th day of october 1722. Sealed &amp; Delivered (being first duly Stamp'd) Richard Steele [ seal ] in the presence of Somerset Draper Edward: Thomas (Edward Thomas is S r Rich ds Serv t .) 3 That these "divers other good Causes and Consideracions" were not a previous money payment seems probable, for in a Chancery pleading of December, 1722, Tonson deposed that for the copyright of The Conscious Lovers he had paid Steele £40 "and other valuable considerations." 4 Had Tonson made previous cash payments it would have been to his advantage to cite them. But by the spring of 1722 Steele must have reached some tentative understanding with Tonson, for on 1 March 1722 Lintot had agreed with Tonson for "the Half of Sir R. Steele's Comedy that was to be published," and paid him £25. 5 A few days after he purchased the copyright from Steele, Tonson on 26 October 1722 made an "assignment" to Lintot of "the Half of the Conscious Lovers, for £70." 6 These two transactions between Lintot and Tonson are somewhat puzzling, especially since according to Aitken, "In February, 1718, Lintot entered into an agreement with Tonson to be equally concerned in all the plays they should buy after eighteen months following the date of agreement." This £70, or £95, 7 seems rather a high price for a partner to pay for his half of a copyright purchased from the author for £40 and undefined considerations. Moreover, it seems unlikely that the £70 was payment for half the copies of the printed play. Lintot's notation "An Assignment for the Half of the Conscious Lovers" is not the usual notation for half a printing; and surely Tonson did not rush the play through the press in six days, then withhold publication for more than a month. Although Steele probably exacted a promise that publication should be delayed until after the first run of the play, the opening performance was scheduled for Novemver 7. An additional indication that the play could hardly have been printed by October 26 is the fact that in his Preface and his Dedication to the King, Steele announced with pride that his play had been "supported and encouraged" and "received with universal Acceptance, for it was in every Part excellently performed." But the actual agreement between Lintot and Tonson, as ambiguously recorded by Lintot, was "to be equally concerned in all the Plays they should buy, Eighteen Months following the above Date [16 February, 1718]." Evidently their blanket agreement had lapsed by 1722, and the original £25 paid Tonson as an "Agreement for the Half of Sir R. Steele's Comedy" was a preliminary and partial payment. On October 26, as Lintot's memorandum book shows, Tonson and Lintot reached a final agreement about The Conscious Lovers . 8 On the last day of the phenomenal run of eighteen successive performances, ending 27 November 1722, The Conscious Lovers was finally announced for publication on December 1, and it duly appeared on that day, 9 although with a title-page post-dated 1723.

The Epilogue actually spoken at the performance was prefixed to the second edition of Benjamin Victor's An Epistle to Sir Richard Steele, on his Play called The Conscious Lovers , published 4 December 1722, and was printed four days later in The British Journal . 10 It has probably never been printed with the play. Of their edition of "many thousand," "a good part" had been sold when the publishers were threatened with a piratical edition. This edition, advertised for 8 December 1722, was, according to Tonson, to be sold by Francis Clifton, Robert Tooke, John Lightbody, and Susanna Collins. Their ventures were indeed not above suspicion. Clifton was a Catholic, and the other three were classed by Negus among the High Fliers, or Jacobites. All except "Lightbody" (or Lightboy), and possibly even he, printed in the Old Bailey. Clifton was continually in trouble for printing attacks against the government. 11 However Susanna Collins was, according to her quondam employee Thomas Gent, a good hearted "ancient gentlewoman." 12 Immediately instituting proceedings in Chancery Court, Tonson deposed that he had obtained the copyright from Steele by deed-poll on October 20 and had duly entered his copy in the Stationers' Register . Yet Clifton and Susanna Collins had "procured or bought one of the printed copies of the Comedy, and had caused several copies to be printed without consent." Under the Copyright Act of 8 Queen Anne he prayed for an injunction. This he obtained on 11 December 1722, after Tooke alone answered proceedings and denied complicity. 13 But piratical editions from other sources Tonson could not prevent. In December there appeared at Dublin an octavo edition. 14 Another edition dated 1723 was published by "T. Johnson: London," 15 and a duodecimo edition for the same year is listed by Nicoll. 16 Despite these piracies printed outside the publishers' reach, however, Tonson and Lintot did not lose by their venture. One of the most popular plays of its day, The Conscious Lovers by 1791 reached its fifteenth edition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Willard Connely, Sir Richard Steele (New York, 1934), pp. 399-400. Mr. Connely was misled by a manuscript note in Francis Grant's Scrapbook of Printed Matter Relating to Sir Richard Steele , p. 16 (now at Harvard): " Lintot's Accounts . . . March 1722. £25 for 1/2 of Sir R. Steele's Comedy that was to be published. (Conscious Lovers) Oct. 26, 1722. £70 for assignment of half of the Conscious Lovers. These £25 and £70 were probably paid to old Jacob Tonson who was the publisher of Steele's plays. Oct. 10, 1722. £14.14 to print 1500 copies of the Funeral , and the Tender Husband ." If Grant got his data from Nichols' Anecdotes , one wonders why he had to guess about the recipient, unless he was trying to distinguish between the two Lintots. Mr. Connely, knowing that old Jacob Tonson was at Ledbury in the fall of 1722, correctly inferred that on 20 October 1722 Lintot could not have paid him. But he did pay Jacob Tonson, Jr. 2 John Nichols, Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century , XIII (London, 1814), 303. Nichols printed his list from "a small Memorandum-book of these enterprising Booksellers [the Lintots], intituled, 'copies when purchased.'" 3 This agreement, now in the Widener Library, is reprinted by the kind permission of Harvard University, which also permitted the use of the Grant Scrapbook . At this time Somerset Draper was presumably an employee in the Tonsons' publishing house. Between 1743 and 1753 he was a bookseller and publisher in London. H. R. Plomer et al., Dictionary of Booksellers and Printers, 1726-1775 (Bibliographical Society, 1932), p. 79. By 1751 he had purchased a share in the copy of this very play. 4 George A. Aitken, "Steele's 'Conscious Lovers' and the Publishers," The Athenaeum , No. 3345, (5 December 1891), p. 771, citing Chancery Pleadings, Winter, 1714-58, No. 690. 5 Nichols, loc. cit. 6 Idem. In his edition of Steele's plays published by T. Fisher Unwin in 1894, Aitken combined these transactions: "As early as March 1, 1772, Lintot has agreed to give Tonson £70 for a half share of Steele's comedy that was to be published." The "1772" misprint was allowed to persist in later printings of this Mermaid edition. 7 It is not clear whether the £70 included the £25 paid earlier. 8 Half of the copyright of The Tender Husband was evidently included in the bargain, for immediately following the memorandum of The Conscious Lovers is the notation "Half of the Copy of the Tender Husband." 9 It was advertised for publication in The Post Boy from November 27-29, and the number for December 1 announced, "This day is published The Conscious Lovers." Grant, Scrapbook , p. 82. The Daily Courant also carried this announcement: George Aitken, The Life of Richard Steele (Boston, 1889), II, 276. In the early histories and hand-books of the drama The Conscious Lovers is regularly dated 1721. In his Bibliography Britannica Watt even moved it back to 1720. Even after Aitken fixed the precise date scholars have continued to err. In the Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature and in Allardyce Nicoll's XVIII Century Drama (Cambridge, 1925), p. 357, it is assigned the date on the title-page, 1723. In his Publishing and Bookselling (London, 1930), p. 178, F. A.

In his Life of Richard Steele , II, 391, Aitken cites a copy in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin. 15 This was presumably published by the same T. Johnson who about 1710 or 1711 published in ten volumes "A Collection of the Best English Plays, printed for T. Johnson, Bookseller at the Hague," including, for example, Steele's Funeral . Whether this T. Johnson ever published in London seems problematical. Some of these volumes bear the imprint "LONDON," and in 1742 a T. Johnson was issuing pamphlets from near Christ's Hospital in Newgate Street. But a Thomas Johnson, probably the same T. Johnson who reprinted plays, was in 1735 a bookseller at Rotterdam. H. R.

      <field name="fulltext">A Long Use of a Setting of Type by Edwin Eliott Willoughby News of the Savoy Conference and of the planning of a new revision of the Bible brought a money-making idea into the business-like mind of John Speed. He acted upon it with little delay and was soon hard at work, probably with the help of the great Hebrew scholar, Hugh Broughton, preparing a table, The Genealogies Recorded in the Holy Scriptures . . . with the Line of Our Savious, Jesus Christ , which he believed would prove a valuable supplement to the new versions of the Bible. King James was no doubt pleased by the emphasis which Speed placed upon the royal descent of the Saviour and on October 31, 1610, granted him the right to print and to insert into every edition of the Authorized Version of the Bible his Genealogies and a Map of Canaan. 1 On February 4, 1617, this special license was renewed to Speed for seven years. 2 Speed died on July 28, 1629. In 1638, his privilege (which had been renewed) and his blocks were bought by the Stationers' Company. 3 Speed prepared editions of his Genealogies and Map for every format in which the Bible was printed. In physical form each edition of the Genealogies consisted of a series of engraved wood-blocks and several pages of letter-press. To print them Speed employed John Beale (who at first had as a partner, William Hall) and, later, John Dawson. The printer no doubt ran off large numbers of copies in the required formats which stationers purchased to complete the sheets of the Bibles which they procured from Barker or his assigns, Norton and Bill. It is probable at other times that Barker or his assigns bought copies of the Genealogies from Speed or his heirs and completed Bibles before selling them to stationers. How many Genealogies were printed is still impossible to estimate. S.T.C. has lumped all editions and issues of Speed's Genealogies under one number—23039. We are concerned here with but one of the octavo editions. It is made up of two sheets and two quarter-sheets and signed A-B 8 , C-D 2 . With the exception of four pages, it is composed of engraved blocks which bear on sigs. C1 v and C2 r the engraver's mark of a member of the van Sichem family— probably Christoffel van Sichem, the younger. Four pages are in letter-press: The first page (the title-page), the second page ("To the Christian Reader"), and—on the back of the Map—two pages of topographical matter entitled "Description of Canaan", sig. C1 r and C2 v . The printer saved the cost of the composition by keeping these four pages of type tied up (stored, no doubt, with the blocks) and using the same setting of type to print the letter-press of successive issues of the Genealogies . He made necessary changes in the date on the title-page—usually a change of but one numeral. Accidents also introduced a few small differences between issues as the printing proceeded. This I conclude from reports which Mr. Herman R. Mead, of the Huntington Library (HN), Dr. William H. Bond of the Harvard Library (HD), Miss E. L. Paford of the Pierpont Morgan Library (PML), and Mr. Lewis M. Stark of the New York Public Library (NY)—to all of whom I here record my hearty thanks—have sent me, along with information which I was able to obtain from Folger Shakespeare Library (FOLG) copies. My correspondents made their reports by comparing copies in their libraries with photostats from a Folger copy and noting agreements and differences. That the same setting of type was used to print the letter-press of issues of an octavo of Speed's Genealogies from at least as early as 1631 and until at least as late as 1640, may be seen by the following table. The first item of it is the date on the title page of each reported issue of the Genealogies . This is followed by symbols of the libraries reporting the issue and the S.T.C. number of the Bible or other book with which it is bound. N.d. HN 2296† 1631 HN 2296†† 1633 NY 2311; NY 2314; PML 2314 1634 HD 2324; HD 2314 1635 HD 2318 1636 FOLG 16408; HD Bible, 1642 1637 NY 2328 1638 PML 2329; HD 2329; NY 2324; NY 2337; FOLG 25140; HN 2337 1640 NY 2342 More issues of this edition of Speed's Genealogies , printed from this setting of type could probably be found. The printers of the Genealogies , also, almost certainly used this method of printing the letter-press portion of other formats of the work. But at this time I am content merely to call attention to a long use of setting of type.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">A Note On King Lear , III.ii.1-3 by George W. Williams The publication of G. I. Duthie's new edition of King Lear , an attempt to produce a critical old-spelling text as near as possible to that which Shakespeare wrote, 1 has raised a problem in the punctuation of the opening lines of the second scene of Act 111. Although in various places he has admitted emendations from modern editors, in these particular lines Mr. Duthie has preferred the First Folio punctuation, and hence the particular meaning derived, to the punctuation as emended by editors from Pope to the present. Since the question of Shakespeare's intention in these lines has thus been reopened, it may be advisable to examine the evidence for the original and the emended punctuation, and the two resultant interpretations of the meaning of these lines, to discover which should be nearer to Shakespeare's probable original. 2 The text of the opening lines appears in the first or 'Pied Bull' Quarto thus: Blow wind &amp; cracke your cheekes, rage, blow You caterickes, &amp; Hircanios ſpout til you haue drencht, The ſteeples drown'd the cockes, . . . In the First Folio there are certain alterations and the mislineation is corrected, but the first line remains run-on: Blow windes, &amp; crack your cheeks; Rage, blow You Cataracts, and Hyrricano's ſpout, Till you haue drench'd our Steeples, drown the Cockes. The meaning seems to be, accordingly: 'blow you cataracts' and at the same time 'spout you hurricanes.' (The reading drown for the Quarto drown'd is customarily taken as a compositor's misprint.) Rowe (1709) was content to preserve this reading, but Pope's emendation (1723) of the punctuation for the first time end-stopped the line: Blow winds, and crack your cheeks; rage, blow! You cataracts, and hurricanoes Spout Til you have drench't our steeples, drown'd the cocks! Thus Pope would have the lines mean: 'blow, crack, rage, blow you winds' and 'spout you cataracts and hurricanes.' Theobald (1733) deleted the rhetorical comma after 'cataracts' and substituted one after 'hurricanoes'; and with a few minor differences in capitalization and in interchange of exclamation points with the semicolon and comma after 'cheeks' and 'rage,' all subsequent editors have followed this emendation by maintaining a full stop at the close of the first line. 3 Such a problem is, of course, an uncomfortable one for an old-spelling editor, who must generally follow the reading of his copytext if it seems to make sufficiently good sense; yet in this case it is probable that Mr. Duthie has been over-conservative and has reprinted a corruption from the First Folio, which he chose as his copytext. The question to be resolved is whether Pope's emendation is preferable to the 'authority' of the Quarto and First Folio, or whether Shakespeare wanted the sense of the concluding words of the first line to be carried over into the beginning of the second. Whatever the punctuation, it would seem that Shakespeare in this passage had in mind the distinction from Genesis 7:11 between the floodgates of heaven (or cataracts) and the fountains of the deep (or hurricanoes), both of which were set in motion at the time of the Deluge. 4 The crux is, whether he would then have taken the verb 'blow' and 'rage' with 'cataracts,' and 'spout' with 'hurricanoes': according to the Quarto and Folio, the cataracts of heaven would rage and blow while the waterspouts from the deeps inundated the land. The emended punctuation, on the contrary, causes the verb 'spout' to have the two subjects 'cataracts' and 'hurricanoes.' Editors with this latter situation in mind have regarded the two subjects as synonyms, both meaning waterspouts, 5 although this duplicate meaning is by no means necessary or even probable. 6 The disadvantages of the Folio reading, followed by Duthie, are three. (1) 'Blow' is not the verb which could be assigned with the greatest of propriety to a cascade of water. 'Rage,' of course, is quite applicable, but the immediate verb must be that one standing nearer its subject. 'Blow,' however, is readily applicable to the winds of the first line and is used once for these winds. (2) By reading 'blow' with the second line, the combination of the three imperatives in the first line secured by the important suspension of the two last verbs 'rage, blow' is wholly lost. (3) If the line is allowed to run on, the epanalepsis , that is the repetition of the same word at the beginning and end of a line of verse, 7 is so very considerably weakened that it is scarcely felt as a figure. The traditional emendation providing the sequence 'spout you cataracts and hurricanoes' may now be examined. If cataracts and hurricanoes are both synonyms for waterspouts, the line may appear redundant. Yet the fact that the words may appear redundant to later critics is no indication that Shakespeare need have been averse to using both words. Both would appeal to the poet experimenting with the new language; stuffing or bombast perhaps they would be, but not without a splendidly effective sound and magnitude. Nevertheless, it is most unlikely that he used them as redundancies: the passage in Genesis need not be a gloss restricted to the Folio's syntactical equation. Indeed, as Milton was later to demonstrate (see footnote 6 above), the imperative 'spout' can in Lear be most meaningfully directed to the floodgates of heaven, the cataracts, and to the fountains of the deep, the hurricanoes, so that Lear in a mighty image is calling for a second Deluge to wipe out the race of men by a joining of the waters of heaven and earth, both of which will share in the drowning of the land. With this poetically more logical and significant meaning depending on emendation, we may return to the Folio text for an enquiry into the source of its probable corruption for these lines. In his extensive introduction Mr. Duthie argues most tellingly that the 'Pied Bull' Quarto was set from a manuscript which had been written by a scribe taking down the dictation of the actors of the King's Men reciting their parts to reconstruct a missing prompt book during a provincial tour. With a wealth of evidence he demonstrates that this hastily written manuscript was almost certainly taken down chiefly in prose and with only casual punctuation, and that at a later time, perhaps in preparation for making a fair copy, a reviser gave it a rough sort of final punctuation and lineation. Mr. Duthie is under no illusions about the quality of this punctuation, and he fitly describes it as sparse, erratic, and never dependable. 8 Since there can now be no question that the Folio text was set from a printed copy of the Quarto annotated by 'Scribe E' comparing it with the true playhouse promptbook, the error in the Folio text originated in the Quarto, and therefore must be attacked in the Quarto. If one follows Mr. Duthie's very plausible account of the origin of the manuscript behind the Quarto, there are two possible explanations for this error. If the scribe were roughly punctuating as he wrote, and if in this case he reproduced what he heard (very likely the actors would dictate by phrase groups or by clauses, pausing at a natural stop), we must assign the error to the actor and believe that in the process of carrying the lines in his memory over the course of months he forgot the unusual rhetorical suspension and slipped into the easier and more natural period offered by the run-on line with its neat pairing of subjects and verbs. As Mr. Duthie has shown in a number of examples, the actors were by no means perfect in their parts and on occasion forgot or confused their lines. If on the other hand we follow the hypothesis that the Quarto text was taken down in prose and almost completely without punctuation, followed by a later revision which rather ignorantly punctuated and lined the text, then regardless of the actor's delivery of the lines we probably have a clear case, as would be expected, of this reviser's failing to understand the delicate suspension and epanalepsis , and consequently reading the lines as seemed most natural to him. These may seem sufficiently plausible alternatives to account for the mispunctuation of the Quarto, yet there is evidence not previously advanced which may lay the blame on the compositor. The Quarto, to repeat, prints: Lear. Blow wind &amp; cracke your cheekes, rage, blow You caterickes, &amp; Hircanios ſpout til you haue drencht, The ſteeples drown'd the cockes, . . . What is at once observable is the faulty comma in the second line after 'drencht', and it is a reasonable hypothesis that we have here a situation by no means unknown in Elizabethan play quartos whereby through a memorial or visual error the compositor misplaced the punctuation concluding one line by dropping it to the end of the line immediately below. 9 If this comma after the second line, which impossibly intervenes between a verb and its direct object, were moved to the line above, we should have the Quarto's conventional light punctuation to end-stop the first line after 'blow'. This is so clear an example of a reasonably common compositor's error that the case could be taken as demonstrated were it not for the lack of a necessary comma in the third line after 'ſteeples', which raises the question whether the comma after 'drencht' is not instead a faulty 'inversion' of this comma from the third line. However, the lack of such necessary punctuation is not at all unusual in the Quarto, as instance the omission of the necessary punctuation after III.i.21 in the same inner forme F with III.ii.3. Yet if there is any slight doubt that the comma after 'drencht' was moved up by compositor's error from 'ſteeples' instead of having been exchanged from 'blow' in the line above, another explanation may be advanced which is perhaps more strictly bibliographical. It is well known that in setting verse a compositor was likely to use a shorter measure, or printer's stick, rather than the longer measure required for the full width of his type-page, and that he would shift to a stick with the full measure when he arrived at a series of long lines or approached a passage of prose. 10 This was an economical custom, for he could fill up the right-hand margin of his type-page more quickly by inserting quads in the page-galley than by setting them individually in his stick to fill out a succession of short lines. When we examine the 'Pied Bull' Quarto, we see that the compositor indeed used two measures according to the nature of his material, a short measure 80 mm. wide and a long measure 93 mm. wide. The lines in question occur on sig. F4 recto of the Quarto, where it can be observed that III.ii.1-3, 10, 21-22, as well as the concluding line of the previous scene III.i.55, are justified to the 80 mm. measure without the use of quads or spaces at the end, that line 18 has probably been concluded by direct setting in page-galley, and that the compositor did not switch to his 93 mm. measure until the prose beginning with line 25. If we then look more narrowly at III.ii.1 where we are questioning the lack of punctuation after 'blow', we see that the line is crowded in the 80 mm. measure. Thin spaces only are used between the words except for the thick space between speech-heading and first word which is invariably maintained by this compositor throughout the play. Moreover, in the first line no thin space is set after the comma following 'cheekes' or the comma following 'rage' although such spaces appear after commas in lines 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Therefore, the line could not be justified in the stick if a comma were to appear after 'blow' unless the compositor were to go to the trouble of picking out the final 'e' in 'cracke' or in 'cheekes' which he had already set, and it is plausible that he did not take this trouble but instead automatically justified his line by omitting the final comma. 11 It would seem that the probabilities are as great (and indeed the two facts may perhaps be connected) that the comma after 'drencht' is the one properly belonging a line above after 'blow', but in either case there is good reason to suspect compositor's error. To sum up, against the 'authority' of the Quarto punctuation we have a much superior Shakespearian reading to be derived by emendation. In turn, this emendation may be assisted by arguments concerning the circumstances of memorial composition of the manuscript behind the Quarto; but if these seem too speculative it is possible to bring forward the fact that within the crucial passage the punctuation is manifestly corrupt in two other places, and that certain lines of bibliographical speculation lead to the conclusion either that the original comma was displaced in error to the verse below or that because of difficulties in justifying the line the compositor did not set it although it was present in his manuscript. There remains the problem of the retention of this corruption in the Folio text set from a marked printed copy of the Quarto corrected by comparison with the promptbook. One must admit that this corrector, Scribe E, devoted some attention to these lines since he relined correctly 2-3, altered 'wind' to 'windes' and 'the' to 'our' before 'steeples', and (unless we may credit the Folio compositor) removed the faulty comma after 'drencht' and possibly placed the semicolon with a following capitalization of 'rage' in the first line. Whoever was responsible, 12 this semicolon and its accompanying alteration of 'rage' to 'Rage' indicates as clearly as may be that in the Folio 'Rage' is intended to begin a new rhetorical period which must necessarily be completed by a run-on line. It was doubtless this consideration which led Mr. Duthie to retain the Folio reading, but in the light of all the evidence adducing corruption in the origin of the reading in the Folio's copytext, it would seem that in this case, as in others which Mr. Duthie has illustrated, Scribe E was careless or chose to believe the superficially more natural rhetoric of the Quarto over the punctuation of the promptbook, if indeed that was perfect. Since no direct Shakespearian authority is present in the copytext for the Quarto, and since positive authority in the Folio is shown only by specific alteration and not by failure to alter, we may if we choose believe that this crux should properly be resolved on the purely literary ground of meaning and style, bibliographical evidence concurring, and that the most fitting conclusion we may reach is that Shakespeare did indeed write: Blow windes, and cracke your cheekes; rage, blow! You Cataracts and Hurricano's, spout Till you have drench'd our Steeples, drown'd the Cockes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Shakespeare's King Lear (Oxford: Blackwell, 1949), p. 3. 2 More than a quibble is involved. Mr. Duthie's text is in most respects so authoritative that future editors will very likely be inclined to use it as a basis for their own editions, in which case his reading of this passage may become perpetuated. 3 Hanmer (1744) reverts to Pope in the pointing of the second line; but for editors following Theobald, cf. Warburton (1747), Johnson (1765), Capell (1767), Malone (1786), Morgan and Manning (1805), Boswell (1821), Dyce (1866), Furness ( Variorum , 1871-80 and 1908), Hudson (1879), Rolfe (1880), Wright ( Cambridge , 1892), Craig (1899), D. N. Smith ( Arden , 1901), Lee (1906), Clark and Wright (1911), Bernbaum ( Arden , 1917), Phelps ( Yale , 1917), Kittredge (1936), and Harrison (1948). 4 Cf. the Vulgate , ". . . rupti sunt omnes fontes abyssi magnæ, et cataractæ cæli apertæ sunt" and the Geneva version, ". . . were all the fountaines of the great deepe broken vp, and the windowes of heauen were opened." 5 For example, the NED enters this passage under "cataract" and also under "hurricano" with a meaning of "waterspouts" for both. There is no question, at least, about the meaning of "hurricano" for Shakespeare, since the NED also quotes Troilus and Cressida , V.ii.172, in which Shakespeare defines hurricano as "the dreadful spout." "Cataract" in this period generally means in the Biblical sense the "floodgates of Heaven" though the waterspouts observed by the explorers in the tropics were so named also, probably because of their size and terrifying violence. "Hurricano" may also mean a violent storm and downpour from the clouds of water sucked up by the sun. If this were the precise gloss to the passage, the reference to inundation from water originating in the ocean is not affected, however, nor the contrast with the waters from the heavenly cataracts. 6 For the common reference of cataract to the floodgates of heaven and the Deluge we may profitably recall the wording of the Vulgate (footnote 4 above) and the Septuagint, and Milton's Paradise Lost , XI.820-25. In another passage strikingly reminiscent of these lines in Lear , Milton in drawing an ironic parallel between Heaven and Hell again recalls the passage in Genesis : ". . . what if all / Her stores were op'n'd, and this Firmament / Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire, / Impendent horrors. . . ." ( Paradise Lost , II. 174-77). It is interesting to find that in these lines indirectly based on the same passage in Genesis which is referred to in Lear , there are cataracts spouting . See also line 14 of this same scene in Lear in which occurs, "spout rain." 7 Epanalepsis was a recognized figure: see Puttenham, Arte of English Poesie , ed. Willcock and Walker (London, 1936), p. 200. 8 Op. cit. , pp. 105-7. 9 Typical examples may be observed in Thomas Dekker, The Shoemakers Holiday (1600), sig. K3 v , lines 1-2; and in Fortunatus (1600), sig. B2, lines 8-9; B2 v , lines 5-6; G4 v , lines 27-28. For inversion of punctuation within a line, see Fortunatus , sig. F2, line 22. For omission of necessary punctuation at the end of a line, doubtless for reasons of justification, see Fortunatus , sig. A3, line 5; B2 v , line 25; C1 v , final line; D4, line 1. I am indebted to Dr. Bowers for these references as well as for some suggestions concerning the bibliographical evidence. 10 W. W. Greg ( The Library , 4th ser., XVII [1936], 178-79) in another connection has pointed out the use of varying measures in this passage. 11 This, of course, may describe the end process only. Actually, if the compositor had set spaces after the commas following cheekes or rage , he would have been unable to complete setting blow in his stick before beginning to justify. Removal of these spaces might just possibly have provided room for the last two types in blow , although there is a slight possibility that some adjustment was made in the space between speech-heading and first word, which may be somewhat narrower here than is customary. Having reached this point, and achieved a satisfactorily justified line including the final word, he may well either have forgotten that a comma should follow, or else not troubled himself further since the passage made sense without a comma. However, the argument that the comma could have been omitted in the process of justifying the line does not depend exclusively on the assumption that spaces originally appeared after cheekes and rage . This compositor omitted the space after a comma in line 2 (which fills the measure), although setting spaces in the following lines of the passage. Yet on other pages where justification does not appear to be in question for a short line in his 80 mm. measure, he frequently omits these spaces. 12 According to the Folio compositors' arbitrary treatment of printed copytexts, this heavier punctuation and the capitalization may as readily be ascribed to the printer as to Scribe E.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Twelfth Day Of December: Twelfth Night , II.iii.91 by I. B. Cauthen, Jr. The old ballad which Sir Toby Belch begins in Twelfth Night (II.iii.91) is never finished: only the first line, O the twelfe day of December, has been sung when Maria, seeing Malvolio approach, interrupts Sir Toby with "For the love of God, peace!" Had Malvolio not entered just then, we might have had a few more lines of the ballad and a better chance to identify the song that has long puzzled commentators on the play. Although most of the other songs in the play have been identified, the original of this ballad has escaped the many searchers for it. William Sidney Walker declared that "it is the first line of a narrative ballad" 1 but did not further identify it. Later editors of the play have not been successful in identifying the song: William Allen Neilson notes that "this song has not been identified." 2 William J. Rolfe explains it as "from some old ballad that has not come down to us." 3 The Cambridge editors, after stating that "the rest of the ballad has been lost," add that "it is conceivable that the words may give us a clue to the actual date of the first performance . . ." 4 G. H. Nettleton, in the Yale Shakespeare , and Arthur D. Innis, in the Arden Shakespeare , have no note on the line. The suggestion has not previously been advanced that the line may refer to a well-known carol of the Christmas-Epiphany season, "The Twelve Days of Christmas," which has flourished in England since the Renaissance and is still sung today. It is conveniently found in print in the Sharp-Marson collection of Somerset folk-songs. 5 The carol begins, On the twelfth day of Christmas my true Love sent to me, and then there follows a listing of the gifts that were presented on the days between Christmas and Twelfth Night—twelve bells a-ringing, eleven bulls a-beating, ten asses racing, nine ladies dancing, eight boys a-singing, seven swans a-swimming, six geese a-laying, five golden rings, four colley birds, three French hens, two turtle doves, and a part of the mistletoe bough, or, and the part of a June apple tree—a long and generous series of gifts. About the singing of this carol, Mr. Sharp has this to say: This song consists of twenty-three verses and is sung in the following way. The second verse begins:— "On the eleventh day of Christmas my true Love sent to me Eleven bulls a-beating, etc.," and so on till the twelfth verse, as given in the text. The process is then reversed, the verses being gradually increased in length, so that the thirteenth verse is:— "On the second day of Christmas my true Love sent to me Two turtle doves One goldie ring, And the part of a June apple tree." In this way the twenty-third verse is triumphantly reached, and that, of course, except for the last line, is the same as the first verse. 6 Mr. Sharp has also pointed out that another way of singing it is to begin with "On the first day of Christmas, etc." and to continue to the twelfth day when the song concludes. This latter version is the most familiar today, but it appears that the older version is the one with twenty-three verses. 7 Country singers seem to have delighted in this type of song and to have regarded such sequences as tests of memory and endurance. 8 Several things can be cited, I believe, to substantiate the conjecture that Sir Toby's unfinished ballad is "The Twelve Days of Christmas." In the first place, Sir Toby has never been praised for his memory, originality, or accuracy; indeed, he is seldom free from the delightful malapropisms and mistakes which mark his speeches. The misunderstanding of "prodigal" as "prodigy" (I.iii.25), the misunderstanding of "lethargy" as "lechery" (I.v.123), and the misuse of "encounter" for "enter" (III.i.74) are characteristic mistakes. It seems not unlikely that he might substitute the word "December" (the month of the Christmas season) for "Christmas" in the first line of a ballad familiar to the English audience of the time. In the second place, the song would not be inappropriate for a play that was named after, and perhaps first performed on, the Feast of the Epiphany. As Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch writes, "It seems a reasonable guess that Shakespeare had written [this play] for presentation on . . . Twelfth Night (Epiphany), 1602." 9 If the play were given at that time, a reference to Epiphany, in the good humored vein of Sir Toby's mistake, would link the occasion of the performance as well as add another deft touch to Sir Toby's character. Then, too, " O the twelfe day of December " appears to be a ballad which contains the definite introduction of a particular day in the first line. Such a first line might belong to a topical broadside ballad, but there should be a definite point to singing it here. There seems to be no such reason to introduce a broadside, for the ballads preceding this one in the text are traditional ones. If a broadside ballad is to break the mood, it should have a definite point alluded to by the date; that point cannot be ascertained here, and hence a traditional ballad seems more acceptable. Among the traditional, "The Twelve Days of Christmas" is the only recorded ballad which has such a definite day-naming at the very first. Therefore we may believe that this unfinished ballad is not an old one that has been lost nor a precise reference which may be used in dating the first performance, but instead that it is a familiar one with a changed first line. This changed line would be in character for Sir Toby, and yet the ballad from which it was taken would be distinctly appropriate for a play called Twelfth Night . The audience, on to the joke when Sir Toby started singing the line (for the tune would give the joke away), would enjoy another example of the Tobian mistake.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Dryden Troilus and Cressida Imprint: Another Theory by Paul S. Dunkin Recently Mr. Fredson Bowers called attention to the fact that there are six different states of the imprint of Dryden's Troilus and Cressida (ist ed., 1679). 1 It is a tantalizing puzzle, and Mr. Bowers warned that his quite plausible reconstruction of the history of the printing must be only tentative because no solution can be proved beyond a doubt. It may be of some interest to look into the possibilities of a somewhat different theory as to what may have happened. Each of the six imprints is introduced by the phrase "London, printed for", names Jacob Tonson and Abel Swall as publishers, gives their addresses in the same wording, and closes with the date, 1679. The two main forms of the imprint differ in that one names Tonson first and the other names Swall first. Mr. Bowers classifies the Tonson-first imprints as T1, T2a, and T2b; and the Swall-firsts as S1a, S1b, and S2. The distinguishing features of each are shown in the following table: T1 T2a T2b S1a S1b S2 Rule A B A A B A London A A A B B B Tonson A A A B B B Swall A B B A A B There are two different settings of type for each of the following elements in the imprint: the phrase "London, printed for" (London); Tonson's name and address (Tonson); and Swall's name and address (Swall). Swall A is followed by a period; Swall B , Tonson A , and Tonson B are each followed by a comma. Swall B has the same line ending in T2a and T2b, but it is better spaced in T2b. Also the rule above the imprint may consist of a 97 mm. piece (Rule B ) which begins at the left margin but does not reach the right margin, or it may be extended to the right margin by an additional 12 mm. piece (producing Rule A ). Mr. Bowers' reconstruction of the history of the printing may be outlined as follows: (1) T1 is printed first. Swall A period is placed before the date correctly and by choice. (2) Required number of Tonson copies is printed. (3) S1a is formed from T1 by removing London A and Tonson A , setting London B , moving up Swall A to follow it, and then setting Tonson B to follow Swall A . Swall A period is overlooked and remains now by error because it is followed by Tonson B instead of by date. (4) S1a begins printing Swall copies. (5) S1b results when the short piece of rule drops out leaving only Rule B . (6) Need for more Tonson copies is discovered while S1b is printing. T2a is formed by using idle London A and Tonson A and setting Swall B . (7) S1b finishes printing the required number of Swall copies. S1b is replaced by T2a. Printing of the second batch of Tonson copies begins. (8) T2b results when the small piece of rule is again inserted producing Rule A , and Swall B is better spaced. (9) Need for additional Swall copies is discovered while T2ab is printing or when it is about to be removed. (10) T2b finishes printing the required number of copies in the second Tonson batch. (11) S2 is formed from T2b by replacing London A with London B , removing Tonson A , moving up Swall B to follow London B , and adding Tonson B at the end. (12) S2 prints required number of second batch of Swall copies. There appear to be several difficulties with this hypothesis. It is, for instance, not impossible that the Swall A period came by mistake from the comma box; the comma box lay in the case just above the period box and it would be easy enough to drop a period into the comma box while distributing. Although a period before an imprint date is not uncommon, T1 is the only Troilus and Cressida imprint so punctuated. Possibly the Swall A period does not represent the compositor's intention in T1 any more than in S1a and S1b where it does, indeed, seem to be an error. If so, the period would have no value as an indication that Swall A was first used in T1 because the compositor who would not bother to remove the period from S1a and S1b where it was in error would scarcely bother to remove it from T1 where it would probably not offend. Again, in step 3, it would seem that a simpler procedure and less time consuming would be merely to rearrange the type already in the forme for T1. Instead, the compositor pulls out London A and Tonson A and sets new London B and Tonson B to take the place which they might have occupied. This would be necessary if London A and Tonson A had pied, but they reappear unchanged later in T2a and T2b. Nor did he do it because he wanted to avoid shifting sections of the imprint; London A which was removed need not have been shifted at all, and Swall A which was left had to be shifted to a position following London B . A similar objection seems to apply to step 11. Here again there is already in the imprint all the type needed, and only a rearrangement would be required. The compositor need not even do that. At step 7 he had replaced S1b entirely with T2a; in the same way he could now replace T2b with S1b. Instead, he removes only part of T2b, and shifts what is left so that he can insert part of S1b. It is, of course, unlikely that the printer of Moxon's day was completely efficient in everything he did; at the same time it is not impossible that he was as eager as any other man to get out of as much work as he could and that whenever he came across something which saved time he might tend to repeat it. Mr. Bowers, it may be noted, was aware of these objections but he felt that even so his hypothesis provided the most reasonable solution of the problem. He was convinced that the Swall A period was used deliberately and correctly in T1. He rejected the idea of a complete new imprint in step 3 because this would mean to follow T1 with S2, and he thought it impossible to work out a convincing order for the remaining imprints if this were done. He suggested that the compositor may have intended to use a new imprint at this point, but delayed setting it until it was too late and then made the alteration in what may somehow have seemed to him the simplest manner even though it does not seem so today. Finally, he recognized that in step 11 the printer failed to use the lesson of step 6, but he felt that it is not necessary to force the compositor always to follow the same procedure in meeting an unusual situation. The following hypotheses are offered as illustrations of what may be done with a somewhat different approach. This approach involves two theories: (1) Both compositor and pressman would have saved time if while one imprint was being used at the press another imprint were set up complete and ready to replace it in the forme as soon as the required number of copies had been run off. The type of T1 is entirely different from that of S2, and T2ab is entirely different from S1ab. In either pair one imprint could replace the other with minimum delay. (2) The switch in parts of the two imprints first used might have resulted if, after the first batch of copies for Tonson and for Swall had been printed, one or more portions of a then idle imprint had been removed for use in some other book naming only one of the publishers. Whatever the sequence, however, it seems necessary to make two assumptions: (1) T2b followed T2a because Swall B is better spaced in T2b. (2) In any two consecutive but typographically entirely different imprints the rule probably (but not necessarily) remained the same; otherwise the short rule was lacking two or more times instead of just once during the printing. A schedule such as (A) or (B) below might be satisfactory. (It may be worth noting that Hypothesis B agrees with Mr. Bowers' feeling that the Swall A period had to appear first in T1.) Hypothesis A (1) S1a is printed first. Swall A period is taken from comma box and never corrected. (2) S1b results when the short piece of rule drops out leaving Rule B . Before S1b is finished printing T2a is set. (3) Required number of Swall copies is printed. T2a replaces S1b and begins printing Tonson copies. S1b is tied up or left in a galley. (4) T2b results when short piece is put back in rule producing Rule A , and Swall B is better spaced. (5) Required number of Tonson copies is printed. T2b is left in the forme or tied up with undistributed title-page type. (6) Swall B is removed from T2b in title-page type to be used in another book. (7) Need for additional Tonson copies is discovered. (8) T1 is made up from what remains of T2b (London A and Tonson A ) plus Swall A from idle S1b. T1 begins printing. (9) Need for additional Swall copies is discovered. (10) S2 is made up from what remains of S1b (London B and Tonson B ) plus Swall B (now finished with other job). (11)T1 finishes printing second batch of Tonson copies. S2 replaces T1. (12) S2 prints second batch of Swall copies. Hypothesis B (1) T1 is printed first. Swall A period is placed before date by accident because it is taken from comma box, or possibly by choice. Before T1 is finished printing S2 is set. (2) Required number of Tonson copies is printed. S2 replaces T1 and begins printing Swall copies. T1 is tied up or left in galley. (3) Required number of Swall copies is printed. S2 is left in the forme or tied up with undistributed title-page type. (4) Swall B is removed from S2 for use in another book. (5) Need for additional Swall copies is discovered. (6) S1a is made up from what remains of S2 (London B and Tonson B ) plus Swall A from T1. S1a begins printing. Swall A period is overlooked and remains now by error because it is followed by Tonson B instead of by date. (7) S1b results when short piece drops out during printing leaving Rule B . (8) Need for additional Tonson copies is discovered. (9) T2a is made up from what remains of T1 (London A and Tonson A ) plus Swall B (now finished with other job). (10) S1b finishes printing second batch of Swall copies. T2a replaces S1b and begins printing second batch of Tonson copies. (11) T2b results when short piece is returned making Rule A , and Swall B is better spaced. (12) T2b finishes printing second batch of Tonson copies.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Proposals of Nine Printers for A New Edition of the Journals of the Continental Congress , 1785. by Edmund P. Dandridge, Jr. In August of 1785 the Continental Congress of the United States, feeling that there should be a cumulative, indexed edition of its Journals , authorized the Secretary of Congress, Charles Thomson, to advertise 'for proposals from the Printers to publish a New Edition of the Journals in folio, Congress taking 1000 copies.' 1 Accordingly Thomson inserted the following notice in newspapers in the principal cities of the young republic: To the PRINTERS OFFICE of the Secretary of Congress, August 26, 1785. The United States in Congress assembled, intending to have a new, correct, and complete Edition of their Journals; the Printers in the several States are here requested to send to this Office, on or before the First Monday of November next, the Terms on which they will engage to publish the said Journals, and to deliver One Thousand Copies thereof. The Person or Persons contracting must engage to have a complete Index made for the Whole, from the Beginning to the First Monday in November, 1785, and inserted in the Volume ending at that Time. The Edition must be in Folio and bound in Boards. The Proposals must mention the Time when the Work can be entered upon, and the Quantity which can be composed daily; and be accompanied with Specimens of Paper and Types. The Work to be carried on at the Place where Congress resides, or within such Distance thereof as shall be determined by the Secretary, who is to superintend the Printing, and revise the Proof-Sheets. CHARLES THOMSON, Secretary. 2 Nine printers replied with proposals that fulfilled all, or almost all, of Thomson's requirements. 3 From the replies a number of interesting facts about the printing trade in America in the late 18th century may be ascertained. All of the bidders were concerned, of course, with costs of the printing of the job; some mentioned costs of indexing and binding. Most of them spoke of paper and its availability, and had something to say about type. One or two referred to proofing, and almost all gave some idea of the speed at which they hoped to be able to work. All but one of them submitted specimens of type and workmanship. I. Since all of the printers did not quote specifically on all the financial aspects of the task and none gave any final quotation for the whole edition, it is impossible to make any comparisons of their estimates for the complete job. It is, however, possible to examine their quotations for printing and for the cost of paper. 4 The two highest bids for printing were made by John Dunlap of Philadelphia, founder of the Pennsylvania Packet and for several years prior to 1785 one of several public printers to the Continental Congress, and by Isaac Collins, printer to the state of New Jersey. They both estimated $12 per sheet for the printing of one thousand copies. Dunlap added $6 for 'two perfect Reams' of paper; and Collins requested an advance for two hundred thirty-three reams at $3 a ream. Dunlap noted that 'the above Price has been made moderate, in the Expectation that the Number of Copies, which will be printed above those ordered by Congress, may sell so as to make Amends, by a small Profit to the Printer.' Another high bid was made by Charles Gist of Philadelphia, who had the backing of Timothy Pickering, then Quartermaster-General of the United States Army and later Secretary of State, in a letter recommending his work and his personal qualifications to Congress. Gist's price of £6.10 ($17) included the cost of the paper. Francis Childs of New York, a protegé of Benjamin Franklin, quoted £6 in 'New York Currency' (about $15) in Pica, or £5.10 (about $13.70) in English, including the cost of paper, and noted that 'if the Journals should make 5 Volumes in English—They would only make 4 in Pica.' When Samuel Loudon, a Whig printer of New York, offered his estimate of $8 per sheet for the printing, he suggested three grades of paper priced for two reams and two quires at $4.25 for 'middling,' $5.50 for the 'best,' and $7 for the 'finest.' The low bids were sent in by Bennett Wheeler, publisher and bookseller of Providence, Rhode Island, and public printer to his own state, and Colonel Eleazer Oswald of New York, one-time public printer in Philadelphia and founder in that city in 1782 of the Independent Gazeteer: or the Chronicle of Freedom . Both bids, Wheeler's at $8 and Oswald's at $8.50 per thousand sheets, included the cost of the paper. Oswald, however, submitted his bid by the single sheet, rather than on the basis of 1000 sheets as the others had done, and gave quotations for three different sizes—Law Folio, Demy Folio, and Royal Quarto, at three farthings, seven-eighths of one penny, and one penny half-penny per sheet, respectively, 'Pennsylvania currency.' The corresponding dollar values were about $8.50, $9.60, and $16.60 on the basis of 1000 copies. One bidder, James Adams, the first printer in Delaware, who had attempted unsuccessfully, a few years earlier, to establish a newspaper at Wilmington, declined to mention specific sums of money, but included in his proposals the following remarks about how his bid could be determined: 'Now, Sir, my Proposals concerning the above mention'd Business, are as follows, viz. That after you fix on the Type you would have the Work printed on, and the Size of the Paper, the Printer or Printers who proposes to do the Work should inform you what his Price by the Sheet, for one thousand Copies will be, exclusive of the Paper, as there is no other Way with Certainty to come to the Knowledge what the printing of the Whole will come to, as it is not known how much it will make; and if he is a Person of good Character in his Profession, I hereby promise , to do the Work considerably cheaper, Provided you will allow me to carry it on here in Wilmington. . . .' Concerning the cost of forming and printing the index, the comments of the printers were varied. Dunlap stated that 'A person of unquestionable Abilities will be employed to make out a complete Index, the Cost of which cannot be ascertained until it is finished, but Care shall be taken to have it done on reasonable Terms. . . .' Childs offered to print it 'in a small neat type at £5 [$12.50] per sheet,' while Gist estimated the cost at £9 ($24.00) per sheet, paper included. Wheeler and Oswald estimated the cost for the index to be the same as for the text of the Journals , Oswald further noting that there would be no charge for forming and arranging the index. Isaac Collins considered the forming of the index as quite separate from the printing, saying, 'The INDEX to be printed in smaller Type . . . for Twenty Dollars by the Sheet; the forming of which to be a separate Charge, the Expense whereof it is impossible at present to ascertain with precision.' The only other mention of expense in the proposals was concerned with the cost of binding the completed volumes, and only six printers referred to the matter at all. Loudon said he could bind the Journals 'in Folio Volumes, in blue boards [for] about half a Dollar each,' and Kollock quoted the same figure for binding volumes of eight hundred pages. Gist would bind them for 5/ (66ç) in volumes of 600-700 pages, or for 6/3 (84ç) for 1000 pages. Childs' bid of 6/ (80ç in his currency) did not refer to the number of pages; and Wheeler wrote that the cost of binding would have to be regulated by the size of the volumes. Adams, also, said that no estimate could yet be made, but added, '. . . as I carry on Bookbinding as well as Printing, [I] hereby promise to bind them cheaper than any other Binder will do them.' Unfortunately no accurate estimate can be made of the final and total cost of the new edition of the Journals , for only one printer, Charles Gist, was willing to venture a prediction of how many pages would be in the completed work. In his proposal he guessed, as a basis for establishing his cost per sheet, that the whole work including the index was 'supposed to amount in the type as per Specimen Y No. 1 to about 3000 pages or 750 sheets folio . . ..' His total quotation for printing and paper at the rate of $15 per sheet would therefore have been in the neighborhood of $11,250, but his bid of $12.50 per sheet for the index would have lessened that figure somewhat. At 80ç per volume for binding, $800 would have been added to the cost of printing and paper, resulting in a final estimate of close to $12,000 for the edition. But when one considers that the Journal entries for 1785 in Fitzpatrick's 1933 edition are in the twenty-ninth volume, each volume in the edition containing between three and four hundred pages, it is reasonable to believe that Gist may have under-estimated the total number of pages that would have been necessary to print the whole from the beginning to the first Monday in November, 1785. II. In addition to estimating costs of printing, paper, indexing, and binding, the nine printers mentioned other items of interest in connection with early American printing practice. Only two of them risked an opinion as to how long the entire job would take, Loudon hoping 'to complete the whole in about a year,' and Gist figuring two years at the outside. But several of them were able to estimate the amount of work they could do in one day or one week. Collins and Oswald assured composing and printing of one sheet every day; and Adams, who must have had the smallest shop of them all, thought he could do 'four or five Sheets a Week . . . on a Fools-Cap Size Paper, in the Letter called Pica and Small Pica.' Gist 'positively engage[d] to deliver one Sheet per day, correctly printed, but should greater despatch be wanted, he will as soon as a sufficient number of expert and steady hands can be procured set another press to work.' Similarly Loudon intended to use two presses for the work, a fact which would probably indicate that he expected to print at least two sheets each day. Dunlap also assured two sheets per day, and Kollock said that 'Twelve sheets will be struck off weekly.' Bennett Wheeler in Providence must have planned to print on three presses at once, for he noted that his establishment would print '12 Pages per day—and more if necessary, as I could hire more hands.' Most of the printers must have thought that Thomson's plan to do the proof-reading himself was a good one and would save them work and responsibility, for only two mentioned doing the proofing in their own shops. In his proposals, set in type as part of his specimen offering, Collins assured the Congress that 'the proof-sheets [would be] conveyed to and from the Secretary by the post-riders,' but in a handwritten letter he noted that he could have the proofs read in Trenton 'by Mr. Houston who has been used to and is excellent at the Business.' Adams, hoping to advance one more reason why he should do the work at Wilmington, said that he could have 'the Assistance of a Gentleman, (now principal Master of our Academy) who has been Corrector in one of the principal Offices in London in revising the Proof-Sheets. . . .' He further pointed out that he would thus 'be relieving [the Secretary] of a great deal of Labour, as it appears you intend to revise the proof sheets yourself—.' A problem in which the printers evinced considerably more interest, however, concerned paper and its availability. Loudon hoped that there would 'be no hindrance on account of Paper,' and Dunlap said he would only be able to commence work after the paper had been made. Kollock would put the work 'to press as soon as a contract for paper can be accomplished, which shall not exceed four weeks,' but Gist felt that he would require at least six months to procure paper and other materials for the job. Adams cautioned that the paper should 'be contracted for without Delay, as the large Quantity that will be wanted will require a considerable Space of Time to finish it.' Only Wheeler, state printer to Rhode Island, seemed to be confronted with no delay; he stated that he would use the same paper as that upon which he had that summer printed the Journals of Assembly for his own state. Apparently the paper manufacturers were particular about prompt payment because Dunlap asked for an advance for 200 reams of paper, and Collins requested money for 233 reams at $3 per ream. Adams wrote, in addition, 'If I should be favoured with the Work, I expect to have Cash advanced to pay for Paper, as our Paper Maker does not incline to spare a single Ream without it.' III Of the specimens of type, paper, and workmanship submitted with the proposals, those of Charles Gist were the most comprehensive. He offered as a sample of his printing abilities a sheet of the Journals of Congress set in Pica, and a sheet of Congressional accounts set in a smaller type that he planned to use for the index. A third sheet was a sample of paper, but he said in his letter that the paper he would use for the job would be 'rather of a better colour.' Finally he submitted a large sheet containing short paragraphs set in forty-three different type styles, half of them Roman and the other half Italic, ranging in size from 'Two Lines English' to 'Pearl Italic.' At the top of the sheet was the information that the types were all 'cast in the Letter Foundry of Dr. Alex. Wilson and Sons. Glasgow. 1783.' Bennett Wheeler offered a copy of his newspaper, the Providence, R. I., United States Chronicle: Political, Commercial, and Historical , for Thursday, Sept. 29, 1785, containing four pages, on the last of which there was a reprint of Thomson's advertisement to the printers. In addition he submitted half a dozen pages of the 'Journals of Assembly (which we printed this summer).' Francis Childs included a sample of a Latin paragraph in Pica with a note saying that it was 'Composed in Latin to shew a greater diversity of types.' Childs in his proposals made certain that his connection with Benjamin Franklin should come to the attention of Congress, for he wrote, 'The subscriber from a Letter received from Doctor Franklin, since his arrival, expects, in the next French packet, a Variety of Types—the Matrixes of which were designed by the Doctor and cast under his direction.' To bolster his credentials he later sent to Thomson that letter itself and another one from Franklin expressing an interest in assisting Childs to establish himself in the printing business in New York. Shepard Kollock also relied on Franklin's eminence as a help in procuring the favor of Congress. For his specimens he submitted both his own proposals and an address to Congress set in Pica, and pointed out that they had been 'printed with a new and elegant Type . . . cast under the immediate supervision of that great Typographer, Doctor Franklin.' At the end of his proposals he noted, 'The superior talents of Doctor Franklin, in the typographical art, in which he is so familiar, flatter the publisher with producing a work which will attract the admiration of Congress; and from which he will derive a proportionate share of the credit.' Oswald and Dunlap submitted sample pages of the Journals of Congress , which they had printed in earlier years while they were serving as public printers. Adams offered samples of Latin paragraphs in three kinds of Roman and Italic sizes, Pica, Small Pica, and Long Primer, and spoke admiringly of his type supply as follows: 'As I have lately imported from London a general Assortment of Types, Specimens of such as I suppose you will have the Work printed on you have here enclosed, think there is not a Printer on the Continent better provided for that Work—If a larger Size Letter than you have here inclos'd might be pitch'd on, I have such.' Samuel Loudon offered no specimens, but suggested 'Lawsize' paper and English type, or 'Demy' paper set in English or Pica. He added that 'The whole (should it be my lot to print them) shall be done with new Types, experienced Compositors and Pressmen.' The proposals of the nine printers afford thus a unique cross section of information about a number of aspects of the printing trade in the young American republic. From them can be made comparisons of costs of printing and paper, prices of indexing and binding, and estimates of the length of time necessary for the completion of the job. With the comments about type, paper, and proofing, and the samples of workmanship, the proposals constitute a collection of contemporary information of particular interest in any examination of early American publishing. A final matter worth noting is that actually nothing ever came of Thomson's advertisement and the printer's replies to it. Evidently the total cost of the new edition would have been too great an expense for the Continental Congress to bear; for after the entry in the Resolve book authorizing Thomson to request bids, there is the following notation in his handwriting: 'On this the Secretary took order to publish for proposals, the proposals he laid before Congress, who referred them to a com e . e . and the com e . e . made report on which no decision is come to.' 5 Instead of the whole new edition originally planned for, Congress decided to satisfy itself with an index to the Journals that had previously been printed by various hands from year to year. On August 15, 1786, the following resolution was passed: 'That the Sec y . of cong. take order without Delay to employ some person or persons to make an Index of the printed Journals of Congress. . . .' 6 There the matter rested.</field>

American dollars as such had not yet been authorized by Congress, but the Spanish dollar, the most widely current coin in the several states, had achieved a fairly constant stability for business transactions, especially in the Middle-Atlantic states. In all but one of the states where the printers resided, the dollar was worth 7/6; in the remaining state, New York, the value of a dollar was set at 8/0. These ratios seem to have remained constant from at least 1782 to 1788.

      <field name="fulltext">Sir Thomas Browne: Early Biographical Notices, and the Disposition of His Library and Manuscripts Jeremiah S. Finch At the time of his death in 1682 Sir Thomas Browne had in his possession a great many of his own papers, some rather uncommon MSS, and a remarkable collection of books. Few men in England had touched so many aspects of the cultural and scientific life of seventeenth-century Europe. Such names as Sir Kenelm Digby, John Evelyn, Sir William Dugdale, Elias Ashmole, John Aubrey, Henry Oldenburg, Arthur Dee, Guy Patin suggest the variety of his acquaintances and the range of his interests. His was one of those wide-searching, ample minds which turned with perfect ease from laboratory experiments to antiquarian studies or rich and imaginative expression in verse or prose. But as the century drew to a close, the cooler heads and more discriminating judgments of the new age were less and less concerned with the lives and achievements of the preceding generation. Even during Browne's lifetime Religio Medici had "grown stale", 1 and thirty years after his death memories had so faded that a brief Life prefixed to his Posthumous Works contained only scanty details. The few biographical accounts that have survived are therefore of some importance, and a word about them and the disposition of his library may be of interest. The essential documents are these: two letters from Browne to John Aubrey in 1672 and 1673, Anthony à Wood's account in Athenœ Oxonienses (1691-92), an anonymous biography prefixed to the Posthumous Works (1712) which included John Whitefoot's "Minutes for the Life of Sir Thomas Browne," and a copy of a letter in the handwriting of Browne's daughter, Elizabeth Lyttleton. These are in addition to a signed pedigree drawn up in 1664 and later amplified by a Norfolk antiquary, the several posthumous publications of Browne's writings, and the Catalogue of the library of Sir Thomas and his son, Edward, sold at auction in 1711. Browne's letters to Aubrey seem to have been replies to inquiries by Aubrey and Anthony à Wood about persons in Norfolk and Oxford, as well as about his own life. Browne mentions Aubrey's "courteous Letter and therin Mr. Woods his request." 2 Presumably Wood made use of Aubrey's materials in Athenœ Oxonienses (1691-92), supplementing the two letters Aubrey had obtained with information available at Oxford. Thus far it is plain sailing, but with the anonymous Life prefixed to the 1712 volume of Posthumous Works , uncertainties arise. This account follows Wood in part, but it also includes some new details about Browne's early life as well as the "Minutes" by his old friend, the Reverend John Whitefoot. The question is: whence these additions? We know that the 1712 publication was a hastily gathered collection of Browne's miscellaneous papers, brought out by Curll, the publisher, probably to capitalize on the public interest aroused by the auction sale of Browne's library the year before. Dr. (afterwards Bishop) Tanner wrote to Dr. Charlet: Curll, the bookseller, has bought, of Dr. Browne's executors, some papers of Sir Thomas Browne . . . it was hurried by him into the press, without advising with any body here, or with Mr. Le Neve, who has great collections that way. 3 According to a note in a copy of the book in the Bodleian Library, the editor was John Hase, Richmond Herald, and the preface states that the manuscripts for the publication were supplied by Owen Brigstock, Browne's grandson by marriage. But the author of the Life is not identified, nor are his sources of biographical information. Nearly a century later a document came to light which reveals the basis for the additions to Wood's account. This was a copy of the letter by Elizabeth Lyttleton, published in the European Magazine in 1801. It was printed as a communication to the editor, and signed "C. D.", who explained that it was found in a copy of Browne's works in the handwriting of Dr. White Kennet, Bishop of Peterborough, with the following prefatory note: MEMDUM, In the time of my waiting at Windsor, in the latter part of Nov. 1712, Mrs. Littleton, a daughter of Sir Thomas Brown, of Norwich, lent me a short account and character of her father, written by John Whitefoot, a minister well acquainted with him, the same person who preacht and publisht a funeral sermon for Bishop Hall. It was contained in one sheet, 4to. . . . 4 Thus, we have a copy by "C. D." of a copy by Bishop Kennet of a letter by Elizabeth Lyttleton which contained a copy of Whitefoot's "Minutes". John Whitefoot, but five years younger than Browne, was for thirty years his intimate friend, and his name appears frequently in Browne's correspondence. He intended to write a full-length life of the physician, but apparently never produced more than the "Minutes", which Mrs. Lyttleton obtained at his death in 1699. In his prefatory note to Browne's Miscellany Tracts (1683), Thomas Tenison mentioned that "there is on foot a design of writing his [Browne's] life; and there are already, some memorials collected by one of his ancient friends." 5 Presumably the "ancient friend" was Whitefoot, and we may surmise that when the materials for the 1712 publication were being gathered, Curll, or Hase, the editor, naturally sought out the sketch Whitefoot was known to have drawn up. The author of the 1712 biography had access to still other information. Wood had asserted that Browne had settled in Norwich to begin medical practice by the persuasions of Dr. Thomas Lushington, his former tutor. 6 In the 1712 account, which follows Wood fairly closely up to this point, Lushington's name is omitted, and in its place is the statement that "by the Persuasions of Sir Nicholas Bacon, of Gillingham, Sir Justinian Lewyn, and Sir Charles Le Gross of Crostwick, he [Browne] retir'd to the City of Norwich." 7 Suspiciously, these three names appear at the top of a cancel sheet. The compiler of the biography must have had good grounds for this last-minute substitution, perhaps additional information from Elizabeth Lyttleton. Bacon, Lewyn, and Le Gross were contemporaries of Browne at Oxford, and in later years were his old and respected Norfolk friends. On the other hand, Wood, in mentioning "the persuasions of Tho. Lushington," may have been reporting faithfully information given him at Oxford. Lushington had gone to Norfolk with Bishop Corbett, and may well have had a hand in the arrangements. From all this it would appear that the 1712 account may be accepted along with Wood's as fairly dependable, since the information in both seems to go back to Browne's own family, friends, or associates in Oxford. Browne's Books and MSS Browne's books and MSS passed into the hands of his son, Dr. Edward Browne, the author and traveler whose reputation as a physician exceeded that of his father, though his writings reveal little of the imaginative power or stylistic brilliance of Religio Medici or Urn-Burial . On Edward's death in 1708, the library became the property of his son, Thomas, the "Tome" whose doings at his grandfather's house enliven the family correspondence. 8 In two years this Thomas, the last male heir, died, and in January, 1711, Thomas Ballard sold the library at auction. The Catalogue printed for the sale, listing well over two thousand items in various languages, is now a very rare book, only four copies being known to exist. 9 In each of the copies are check marks, presumably indicating items the purchasers wished to bid for, but there is no record of the successful buyers at the auction. The fate of Browne's papers and MSS is more definitely known. The title page of the sale Catalogue mentions "Choice Manuscripts," indicating that they were sold at the same time as the books, though individual items are not listed. Curll had succeeded in buying the papers printed in Posthumous Works from Owen Brigstock, who also presented Richard Rawlinson with a copy of Browne's diploma from the College of Physicians. 10 Bishop Tanner possessed a MS of Repertorium , now in the Bodleian Library. 11 The MS of Browne's Christian Morals , which was known to exist, was for some time in the hands of Thomas (later Archbishop) Tenison, having been loaned to him in a box with other MSS by Edward Browne. When the box was returned this MS was missing, and was not found until a special search was made in the presence of the Archbishop. In 1716 it was printed, with a dedication signed by Elizabeth Lyttleton. Some other MSS found their way into the Bodleian Library through the medium of Dr. Thomas Rawlinson, but Wilkin in 1836 could not discover "how or when he obtained them." One item in the Rawlinson group is a "Catalogue of MSS. &amp;c." listing those formerly in Browne's possession and probably drawn up just before they were sold. 12 However, the bulk of Sir Thomas Browne's MSS was purchased by Sir Hans Sloane, the physician and bookman whose collections were brought together with the Cottonian and Harleian libraries to form the British Museum. "Sr. H. Sloan has all his [Browne's] &amp; Sons MSS," noted William Stukely in his Commonplace Book. 13 This is not quite accurate, but Sloane did indeed acquire a great many, comprising over a hundred volumes. That he also secured some of Browne's specimens and antiquities is indicated by Curll's having printed, in the Posthumous Works , an engraving of an urn with the acknowledgement: "A Roman Urn . . . Now in y e Possession of D r Hans Sloane." Tempted by the possibility that Sloane might have purchased, in addition to MSS, some of Browne's printed books and that they might therefore be in the British Museum, the present writer in 1939 tried to run down some of the marked items in the Museum copy of the Browne sale Catalogue , on the chance that they represented Sloane's purchases. The copy of the Catalogue did prove to be Sloane's, and by good luck in the process of the search part of Sloane's own catalogue of his printed books was discovered. 14 But since the recovered portion of Sloane's catalogue contains few titles acquired as late as 1711 (the date of the sale of Browne's library) and since Browne does not seem to have been in the habit of putting his name in books, none of the items examined could be positively identified as his. One suspects that a number of volumes now quietly resting in the British Museum were once to be found in the Browne residence in Norwich and were lovingly read by Sir Thomas and perhaps by his son and grandson—but so far, like the ashes in the funeral urns of which the old physician wrote so movingly, their identity remains obscured by the iniquity of oblivion.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Some Observations on the Philadelphia 1794 Editions of Jefferson's Notes Coolie Verner In his American Bibliography , 1 Charles Evans refers to the 1794 edition of Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia , printed in Philadelphia for Mathew Carey, as being "In two states, printed on thick, and on ordinary book paper." There are, however, other distinguishing features defining these two states 2 that give some insight into the printing-house practices of Mathew Carey's printer. 3 Examination of copies 4 in the two states shows that the printers had apparently run the first three signatures (B, C, and D) 5 on thin, or ordinary paper, before the decision to add some thick-paper copies was made. The type from the six formes of these three signatures had by then been distributed. The reason for the decision to add thick-paper copies is not clear. The thick paper (watermarked AL MASSO) 6 is clearly superior to the ordinary book paper, but it cannot be stated with any finality whether the additional copies were for premium sale or simply to augment the edition. Augmentation of an edition by the use of a different stock of paper would, even today, 7 involve some attention to the gathering of sheets for a given book from piles of similar paper stocks. 8 Disregarding the reset run needed for B-D, the remaining sheets would, therefore, have been run (whether for premium sale or simple augmentation) with a proportion of each sheet in each stock, not some sheets entirely in one stock and others entirely in another. Since both states can be found in contemporary bindings very similar in quality, 9 the true explanation is probably a combination of the premium sale and augmentation theories. From signature E forward, the thick paper was worked in continuous printing with the ordinary paper, and interestingly enough the point at which the first three signatures were re-run can be determined with some nicety by an examination of the brackets around the page numbers. These page brackets were left by the imposer in the chase, skeleton fashion, though the numbers were, of course, changed for each forme. The brackets themselves are too uniform and were too frequently broken or pulled and replaced during the running of the formes 10 to be of much use as timetables, but their distance apart varied with the two-digit page numbers, the three-digit numbers in the 100's, and sometimes additionally with the three-digit numbers above 200. Measurements of the distances apart of the brackets show that all of the reset formes were run after the two-digit bracket spreads. More specifically, reset D was machined after outer O (pp. 97-104, the last forme to contain a mixture of 2-and 3-digit spreads, such as reset D has) and before P; and reset inner C (with an 18 mm. spread on C2 r ) followed inner Cc (the first with an 18 mm. spread; the only others to contain a similar spread are Gg, Ll, and Uu, the first two of these with the extra spread in the same position as reset C and Cc). The thick-paper B-D signatures were completely reset by a different compositor from the one who set the original states of B, C, and D. The compositor of the second state re-appears at other points in the book, 11 and seems to have been setting from the same cases 12 as the first compositor. The effort to find means of distinguishing special characteristics of two compositors in a late 18th-century American shop is instructive, but the evidence discovered is largely negative. Variations in the measure are negligible and certainly useless as distinguishing characteristics. This was, of course, in part caused by the fact that the compositor was resetting the same words in the same font 13 from probably the same case. Typographical variation in typesetting habits is extremely difficult to spot, the use of ligatures and of the long ſ being for all practical purposes identical between the two. Indeed the only observed variation, other than orthographic ones, 14 is in the space following a period at the end of a sentence. The spacing of the second-state compositor is often measurably larger than that of the first-state compositor. The first-state compositor justified his lines containing sentence breaks more amply between words than between sentences. Proofreading before the presswork began seems to have been reasonably good, although once the formes were locked, very few changes seem to have been made. 15 Outer P was unlocked 16 for corrections in the tabular material on P2 v (p. 108) and P4 v (p. 112), where some states (NjP and NcD) have incorrect totals: "106" for "109" on p. 108, and "21" for "421" on p. 112. Ordinarily it would be assumed that such variations were clear evidence of in-press proofing, but the incorrect states in their two located occurrences appear on both thick and thin paper. Unless, therefore, the two papers were run in a senselessly intermittent fashion, the error arose not from pre-proofed pulls, but from a press accident which straddled the paper change. This latter assumption is borne out by the alignment on page 112 of the erroneous "21" under a three-digit number, which clearly indicates that a "4" has dropped out. Neither the map nor the folding chart seems to have been involved in the two-paper proposition. The map, however, has been found printed on two stocks of paper: heavy and ordinary. Both map stocks have been found with both paper stocks. This was probably due to the map's having been re-used repeatedly in other publications of Mathew Carey. 17 Most copies of the map with this edition are unwatermarked, although the ViU ordinary paper copy has a map watermarked HONIG. The folding table is found watermarked with (1) a crown, circle and bell, (2) with letters F B, and (3) with letters S L. There is no consistency in the way these watermarks appear in the several copies or in the two states, and since the chart is a half-sheet, it is assumed that of the two initial groups, one of them is a counter-mark. For the sake of collectors interested in knowing the comparative rarity of the two states of the copies examined, the proportion is three 18 of the thick copies to thirteen of the ordinary paper copies. The edition has no textual importance, and it must be clear from the above discussion that neither state has priority except in the first three signatures, in which the ordinary paper was the earlier typesetting and impression. One might judge from the surviving copies that there were perhaps 1000 copies originally planned, and that perhaps this was upped by several hundred with the addition of thick paper. It is significant that three copies 19 are known bound with the separately printed appendix of 1800. These were evidently held in stock for 16 years by some bookseller who took advantage of Jefferson's election to the presidency to dispose of his remainder with newly-issued material.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Vol. 9, Chicago, 1925. 2 The two states are most readily distinguished by their thickness (Ordinary paper 2 cm; thick paper 2.5 cm) and by the spellings "Missisipi" and "Erié" in the first three sheets (B-D) of the ordinary paper, as opposed to "Mississippi" (generally, though the word occurs twice on p. 1, once "Mississipi") and "Erie" in the thick-paper. 3 The printer has not been identified. He printed in the same year, for William Hall, Tench Coxe's View of the United States . Mathew Carey in this period was employing several printers, whose modified Caslons are all easily enough distinguished by the J's and Q's. The swash Italic J of this printer has not been found in the font of any other Philadelphia printer of the day. 4 This article is based on an examination of 16 copies: DLC 4, ViU 2, ViW 2, DGS, NcD, ICN, OCI, NjP, MHS, MiU, and a personally owned one marked CV. All headlines were compared, and where variations showed, the forme was minutely collated. 5 A complete copy should collate 8°, A 2 B-Uu 4 , with map in front and a half-sheet inserted table of Indian Tribes after S3. 6 Much of the thin paper is also watermarked with this same mark, but some is also unwatermarked. 7 See, for example, the Murray Printing Company's trade journal, On the Surface , for April, 1949, p. 1, " We Deserved It ". The practice of running cheap play quartos on job lots of paper of different qualities (see A. H. Stevenson, "New Uses of Watermarks as Bibliographical Evidence," Papers of the Bibliographical Society, University of Virginia , I (1948-49), 151-182) can never have been customary in the better class of book. 8 Of the 16 copies examined, only 3 show paper mixtures. Of these, DLC-4 and CV have a thick-paper Z in an otherwise thin-paper copy, indicating a short run Z. CV is furthermore completely lacking signature L, indicating a probably late-gathered copy. DLC-1 is badly mixed (Prelims thin, B-E thick, F-M thin, N-Uu thick) and clearly late gathered. It has a 1796 state of the map, for example. In spite of an apparently high proportion of mixtures, it is clear that normal copies should be all of one kind of paper. 9 E.g. , ViU copies. 10 E.g. , ViU-2, N1 r (p. 89); NjP, P2 r (p. 107); NcD, OCl, and ViU-1, Kk1 r (p. 249). 11 E.g. , Pp3 r (p. 293) has "Lake Erie", without the first-state compositor's accent. 12 See footnote 13. 13 In the first state of B1 v , lines 1 and 5, the degree marks are superior figures, whereas in the second state they are made from broken eights. This was probably due to ignorance on the part of compositor 2 of the fact that a small font "o" could be made into a superior figure. On Q2 v the compositor of B-D 2nd state may have learned the use of the superior "o" at line 12 or 19. The difficulty, however, of distinguishing between carefully broken 8's and a superior "o", combined with the possibility of a mid-page change in compositors, has ruled this evidence out either as a timetable factor for the resetting of B-D, or as evidence for two compositors. 14 One additional habit can be associated with him: the 2nd state signature letters were centered not on the page margins as in the first state, but on the distance between the left-hand page margin and the left-hand margin of the catchword, a phenomenon that recurs at irregular intervals elsewhere in the book. The specific variations of 2nd state from 1st state, besides Mississippi, Erie, and the degree mark, include additional commas by 2 at several points, and a tendency to hyphenate certain place-names. 15 Thus certain misprints survive. In D1 v line 19 "propable" for "probable" is in all copies of state one, though it was corrected in the second setting, as was "Gulp" for "Gulph" in C3 r line 12. D3 r "Waetrs" is uncorrected in the first state. Z1 r has "discription"; Kk1 r "Sympton". 16 Other observed forme unlockings involve only the position of the headline: Inner D first state ViU-1 and DLC4 differ from all others on D1 v (p. 18) and D4 r (p. 23); Inner P ViU-2 differs from DLC 1-3 on P4 r (p. III); Inner and Outer Z thin-paper copies ViU-1, LC2-3, DGS, NcD, ICN, OCL, and thick-paper signatures ViU-2, LCl &amp; 4, CV, and MiU on both Zz r - v (p. 171-2). 17 The map is: The State of Virginia from the best authorities, By Samuel Lewis. 1794 American miles 69 1/2 to a Degree (scale) Smither Sculpt .

      <field name="fulltext">The Cancels in Lockman's Travels of the Jesuits , 1743 Jessie R. Lucke BIBLIOGRAPHERS have not hitherto observed that vol. 1 of the first edition in 1743 of John Lockman's Travels of the Jesuits , 1 printed in two octavo volumes for John Noon at London, contains two cancellans leaves found replacing sigs. H1 and 2C5, respectively. In each case the type for the cancellans has been reset, an indication that the discovery of the need for cancellation was not made until a relatively later time when the type for the original forme of each sheet had been distributed. The first cancel leaf, sig. H1 (pp. 97-98), was printed simply to correct a printer's error in the original. A footnote on sig. G8 v (p. 96) was intended to carry over and to conclude on H1 r , but this carry-over was inadvertently omitted in the original printing. The cancellans supplies the 4-line remainder of the text of this footnote as follows: to enquire into the Affair . . . . The Result was, Mendiola prov'd their Guilt, (confessing at the same Time his own) to the utter Confusion of the other Jesuits. He afterwards quitted their Society. La morale practique des Jesuites , Tom. I. p. 257, &amp; seq. However, this addition had to be made at the expense of other material; and, to fit it in, the cancellans omitted the final four lines of the first footnote to appear on sig. H1, substituting only the notation 'Ibid., pag. 17.' This deleted footnote text is here reprinted from the cancellandum: They rely so much on this, that they presumed to tell Pope Clement VIII. that if he offered to make a Decree against them, in the Affair de Auxiliis , they would put the whole Church into a Ferment. La morale practique des Jesuites , Vol. I. pag. 17. In the process of resetting the leaf for the cancellans, no other changes were made on H1 r . On H1 v a comma was added in line 2 after 'Colours', in line 24 'excessively' was substituted for 'piercing' before 'hot', and in line 29 'the' replaced 'we' before ' Europeans '. The lineation of the cancellans does not always conform to that of the original. In contrast, the second cancel, that on sig. 2C5 (pp. 393-394), was made to delete certain opprobrious lines on the recto and to substitute a milder version. The second footnote on the cancellandum ended: Had these been Fools, as they are Hypocrites, the two following Lines (of Dennis , I think) might have been justly applied to both. Thus one Fool lolls his Tongue out at another, And shakes his empty Noddle at his Brother . In the cancellans, these lines are replaced by: Such Impositions must naturally raise the Indignation of a thinking, honest Man; and may incline him to entertain a very unfavourable Idea of the Probity of his Fellow-creatures, in general. No other alterations appear on 2C5 r , but on the verso (p. 394) a few minor changes may be recorded. Thus the cancellans removes the original capitalization of 'Native' in line 15, places the period outside instead of inside the quotation marks at the end of the first paragraph, alters 'infinite' to 'infinitely' in line 31, and substitutes 'more' for 'greater' as the first word of line 36. A binder's error in the copy preserved in the University of Virginia Library reveals the position in which these two cancel leaves were printed and also offers other interesting information about the printing of the two volumes. The collation for vol. 1 is: 8°, i 4 A 8 a 4 B-G 8 H 8 (±H1) I-2B 8 2C 8 (±2C5) 2D-2H 8 2I 4 ; pp. [2] π i-vi, i-xxii xxiii-xxiv, 1-487 488 2 . In the Virginia copy, however, the cancellanda are still in place, and gathering 2I consists of eight leaves. The first and fourth folds, that is the first, fourth, fifth, and eighth leaves, constitute gathering 2I as it was intended to be bound in 4's. The second fold (the second and seventh leaves) is signed 'a' and 'a2' in italic and contains the table of contents for vol. 2 (missing in vol. 2 of the Virginia copy). The third fold consists of the two cancellans leaves, the third leaf signed 'H' and paged 97-98, and the sixth leaf unsigned but paged 393-394. This method of imposition offers an excellent example of economy in printing. If the sheet were properly cut before folding and binding, one-half would be separated and would contain gathering 2I to be folded in 4's. If the remaining half-sheet were again sected, the two-leaf fold containing the contents of vol. 2 would be separated from the fold containing the cancellans leaves for vol. 1; and once these latter leaves were separated they could be substituted in their proper positions for the cancellanda. The evidence of the imposition is interesting as illustrating that in this book the full sheet 2I was intended to be separated into its parts before folding. The fact that the table of contents for vol. 2, with its pagination references, was printed as an integral part of the final text gathering of vol. 1 indicates most probably not that the type for this gathering was kept standing until vol. 2 had been set and printed but instead that the two volumes were simultaneously printed. A study of the press-numbers, although the details are too complex for presentation here, confirms this conclusion. According to these numbers, three presses were engaged in printing the two volumes. It is significant that no press-numbers appear in the text sheets of vol. 1 until gathering N, indicating that one press (undoubtedly press 2) printed and perfected these sheets. From N to S the press-numbers show that presses 1 and 2 printed or perfected the sheets for each other, although sheets T and U were both printed and perfected by press 1. With gathering X, press 3 enters the printing, and thereafter the three presses irregularly print and perfect, with press 2 somewhat in the minority. Vol. 2 was printed by presses 1 and 3 except that press 2 entered once to print the inner forme of the penultimate sheet 2I. The evidence suggests, therefore, that while press 2 was printing sheets B-M of vol. 1, presses 1 and 3 had substantially printed vol. 2 and thereupon turned to assist press 2 in completing vol. 1. Hence when sheet 2I of vol. 1 (numbered by press 3) was printed, the contents for vol. 2 could be included economically to help fill out a full sheet containing the final vol. 1 gathering in 4's and also two leaves of cancellans.</field>
