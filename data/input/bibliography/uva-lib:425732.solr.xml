      <field name="heading_text">The Life and Work of Fredson Bowers by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In every field of endeavor there are a few figures whose accomplishment and influence cause them to be the symbols of their age; their careers and oeuvres become the touchstones by which the field is measured and its history told. In the related pursuits of analytical and descriptive bibliography, textual criticism, and scholarly editing, Fredson Bowers was such a figure, dominating the four decades after 1949, when his Principles of Bibliographical Description was published. By 1973 the period was already being called "the age of Bowers": in that year Norman Sanders, writing the chapter on textual scholarship for Stanley Wells's Shakespeare: Select Bibliographies , gave this title to a section of his essay. For most people, it would be achievement enough to rise to such a position in a field as complex as Shakespearean textual studies; but Bowers played an equally important role in other areas. Editors of nineteenth-century American authors, for example, would also have to call the recent past "the age of Bowers," as would the writers of descriptive bibliographies of authors and presses. His ubiquity in the broad field of bibliographical and textual study, his seemingly complete possession of it, distinguished him from his illustrious predecessors and made him the personification of bibliographical scholarship in his time. When in 1969 Bowers was awarded the Gold Medal of the Bibliographical Society in London, John Carter's citation referred to the Principles as "majestic," called Bowers's current projects "formidable," said that he had "imposed critical discipline" on the texts of several authors, described Studies in Bibliography as a "great and continuing achievement," and included among his characteristics "uncompromising seriousness of purpose" and "professional intensity." Bowers was not unaccustomed to such encomia, but he had also experienced his share of attacks: his scholarly positions were not universally popular, and he expressed them with an aggressiveness that almost seemed calculated to encourage resistance. Anyone who is innovative and rigorous can expect that opposition will come as readily as praise; and Bowers's career fascinatingly illustrates the interplay between ideas and personality in intellectual history. Furthermore, the "professional intensity" that Carter alluded to did not circumscribe Bowers's life; his extraordinary energy allowed him to engage in, and enjoy, a wide variety of activities besides the ones with which (as he knew) his name would permanently be linked. Scholars, like other artists, create in their work a version of the world, and their creative activities can never be divorced from their experience of life. Bowers's life was one of controversies, and one of satisfactions. The details of that life are of interest not only as the story of a great scholar but also as an account of a life lived to the full.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Fredson Thayer Bowers was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on 25 April 1905, the son of Fredson Eugene Bowers and Hattie May Quigley. He was the only child of this couple, but he had two half-sisters, Ruth and Rita Brownell, from his mother's previous marriage. The Bowers name belonged to one of the oldest Connecticut families. A John Bower (or Bowers) moved to New Haven in the 165os from Massachusetts (where the family went back to the 163os) and became in 1672 the first minister in Derby, Connecticut; "Bowers" was therefore regarded as one of New Haven's "ancient" names (as in the first volume of Donald Lines Jacobus's Families of Ancient New Haven , 1923). In later life Bowers took some interest in his family's history but never investigated it, and he lamented the fact that the results of his uncle Thomas's genealogical researches had apparently not been preserved. He was unable to connect his family to the early one with certainty; but because his father was born in Derby, he liked to believe that the connection existed. His middle name, Thayer, figured in his paternal grandmother's family, and he was proud of its being "a good New England name, among the best in fact" (as he put it in a letter of 1 April 1988 to his eldest son, Fredson Thayer Bowers, Jr.—whose son, Fredson Thayer Bowers III, he hoped would in turn carry on the tradition). At the time of Bowers's birth, the family lived in the shadow of Yale at 161 Whalley Avenue, and his father was president (and his uncle Thomas secretary-treasurer) of the Gilbert Manufacturing Company, one of a half-dozen corset-manufacturing companies in New Haven. It was a family business, Gilbert being his paternal grandmother's maiden name; but his father and uncle were early enthusiasts for automobiles and seemed to care more about cars than corsets. In 1904 or 1905 they added to the company's products such fabric items for automobile passengers as aprons, covers, and leggins, and about 1906—07 his father established the F. E. Bowers Company, Inc., as a manufacturer of carburetors and motor parts. Bowers was only one year old when the automotive activities of his father and uncle were publicized in a local magazine under the heading "Big Autos of the Town" ( Saturday Chronicle , 28 July 1906)—a brief article illustrated with photographs of the brothers in their cars. Thomas G. Bowers was shown in the 30-horsepower machine that had been constructed to his specifications from parts he had purchased on a trip; and Fredson E. Bowers was pictured in his 25-horsepower Rambler, which had a "French grey" body of his own design and was "One of the handsomest and speediest high powered runabouts seen about the city." F. E. Bowers and his mechanic could be observed "nearly every night burning up the roads in New Haven county," and one is tempted to think that he sometimes took his son for rides and that this early acquaintance with automobiles was the origin of Bowers's lifelong devotion to sports cars. (He owned a succession of them, including a Jaguar, an Alfa-Romeo, and a Mercedes; and his many nonstop drives to distant places were—whether intentionally or not—in the tradition of his father's fondness for long automobile trips.) Bowers was not quite six when his father died (on 9 February 1911, at the age of thirty-nine, while attending the Chicago Automobile Show), bringing the brief existence of the F. E. Bowers Company to an end; but the aura of automobile enthusiasm continued as a presence in his life through his uncle and the fact that the ongoing Gilbert Manufacturing Company had by 1909 switched exclusively to automobile-related fabrics (the corset business being set up separately as the Gilbert Corset Company). Just before F. E. Bowers's death, the family had moved to West Haven, but Hattie Bowers, as a widow, soon went back to New Haven and then, in late 1913 or 1914, married Charles K. Groesbeck, a stenographer at the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. Bowers thus had a stepfather during all his high-school and college years (in fact, Groesbeck's death on 13 June 1925 came just four days before Bowers's graduation from college; his mother later took a fourth husband, George Bassermann). At this time the family lived at 111 Brownell Street, within walking distance of New Haven High Public School, which—at York Square—was adjacent to Yale and the old New Haven cemetery. In high school Bowers took—besides the usual courses in composition, literature, chemistry, and geometry—two years of French, three of German, and two and a half of algebra (the latter perhaps foreshadowing his interest in bibliographical collation formulas). In the summers he enjoyed outdoor activities at camp, and he worked in a camp the summers before and after his senior year (as he described in a letter of 10 March 1980 to his oldest son): When I was fifteen and sixteen I worked as a councillor in a summer camp at Eastford, near Putnam, Connecticut, on Crystal Lake. I had been at the camp for several years before and had had a fine time. I was hiking master, and had to take the young boys out on overnight hikes, sometimes canoe trips, just so long as they could sleep on the ground and have flapjacks for breakfast, which I had to cook at the crack of dawn over an improvised wood fire between a few stones. Bowers graduated from New Haven General High School (as it was then called) in 1921 and decided on Brown University as the place for his college work. In the autumn of 1921, at the age of sixteen, Bowers entered the freshman class at Brown, where he majored in English; following an introductory survey of English literature, he studied contemporary novels with Kenneth O. Mason, Romantic literature with Percy Marks, Shakespeare with George Wyllys Benedict, the English novel with Albert Knight Potter, and modern English drama with Thomas Crosby, and in his senior year he was one of the undergraduates admitted into Walter C. Bronson's special graduate seminar. He also took basic courses in biology, astronomy, philosophy, history, economics, music, Latin, Greek, and Spanish, as well as more advanced courses in mathematics and French. The year-long music course that he attended in his junior year is worth noting because it no doubt played some role in causing music, and the detailed analysis of it, to be an important element in his later life; this class, taught by Gene Wilder Ware, the university organist, was designed (in the words of the catalogue) for students "who wish to acquire an intelligent understanding and enjoyment of good music." Bowers's marks were sufficient to bring him scholarships, "preliminary honors," and junior-year election to Phi Beta Kappa. In his first three years he received all As in his English courses (with a few lower grades in some of the other subjects), but his marks were distinctly less good in his senior year, no doubt because of his many extracurricular activities. In that year he was editor-in-chief of the Daily Herald (the student newspaper), leader of the Glee Club (and thus co-director of the program for concert tours through New England and a larger tour that included Detroit, Kent, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Atlantic City, New York, and Hartford), vice president of the Sphinx Club (a small faculty-student group that met for discussion), and a member of the Varsity Quartet (as a bass), the Banjo Club (and its Hawaiian Trio), the Cammarian Club (a student governing board), and the editorial boards of the Brown Jug (the student humor magazine, which sold widely outside Brown) and Casements (the student literary magazine, which also contained work by established writers and which was distributed nationally through certain bookstores and newsstands). From his sophomore year on, he had been active in the campus musical clubs and in the English Club (a small group of a dozen or so that met every few weeks to discuss literary matters and hear papers, such as his 15 October 1924 paper on Vanity Fair ), as well as in several other clubs and his fraternity, Alpha Delta Phi. To earn money for living expenses, he also led a small jazz band, playing saxophone and Hawaiian guitar himself. (The difficulties of putting together sufficient money at this time may in part underlie the thriftiness that was one of his lifelong characteristics.) The student yearbook, Liber Brunensis , offered this assessment of him at the end of his senior year: "Fred" is one of God's little masterpieces, a true sophisticate. His mental capacity is remarkable. He made Phi Bete without half trying; and, besides winning every species of scholarship, won popular recognition in no small way. "Fred" has not confined himself to college activities during the last four years, however, and is decidedly a man about town. We expect great things from "Fred" within the next few years. Those who knew him later in his life will not be surprised by these comments or by the energy level reflected in his college record. The most important extracurricular activity of his senior year was not mentioned in the yearbook: in the fall of that year, at the age of nineteen, he got married. On 11 November 1924, at St. Ignatius (Protestant Episcopal) Church in New York, he wed Hyacinth Adeline Sutphen, a 1924 graduate of Smith College (a French major) and a member of a New York Social Register family that was descended from Dirck van Zutphen, a seventeenth-century Dutch settler in New Amsterdam. She was two years and four months older than Bowers (born 18 December 1902), the youngest of four children of John Schureman Sutphen and Mary Tier Brown, and had lived with her parents at their place in Ormond, Florida, as well as at 311 West 72nd Street in New York (not far from St. Ignatius Church, at West End Avenue and 87th Street). Perhaps because of her social standing, the marriage was written up in the New York Times (13 November 1924), in an article headed "Brown Senior Weds Hyacinth Sutphen: F. T. Bowers, Rhodes Scholarship Candidate, and Smith College Student Marry Secretly." Some of the circumstances of the secrecy, though not the background of it, were described: The wedding was arranged with the utmost secrecy, the only person at the university who knew of the plan being a close friend and classmate of the bridegroom who acted as best man [Emile Seth Hall]. When Bowers left his fraternity house Monday, saying he was going to New Haven, his announcement was regarded with skepticism, and a few of his fraternity brothers, believing he was going to be married, showered him with rice. After a brief honeymoon at Hot Springs, Virginia, Bowers was again immersed in his hectic round of activities at Brown. Aside from his marriage, the most notable aspect of his undergraduate life, particularly in light of his later career, is the large amount of writing he produced. In addition to an introductory composition course, he took a year-long intermediate course in his sophomore year and a year-long advanced one in his senior year, the former taught by Percy Marks and the latter by George Wyllys Benedict. Under Marks's encouragement, the students in his class brought out an anthology of their classwork in late May 1923. Bowers was one of three editors of The Anthology of English 3,4 , and the piece of his included in it was a short story called "Release," about the suicide of a young opium addict, whose life had always been in a world of dreams and whose final dream was of a "grinning idiot" who "sang the idle tale of life" and pulled "the gossamer strings that made men love and hate, kill and destroy," wailing futilely as the universe "plunged to destruction through icy aeons of space." Marks, a popular young professor, was at that time working on his first novel, The Plastic Age , which after publication in early 1924 became a best seller (and later a film), famous for its portrayal of jazz-age college life and its emphasis on alcohol and sex. Everyone at Brown assumed that the novel depicted the local scene (the review in Casements said that it "tells the truth"), and it apparently cost Marks his job. (An editorial in the Herald on 26 May 1924—after Bowers had become editor on 3 May—called the loss of Marks "a decided blow to the many men who have taken courses with him.") However much "Sanford College" in the novel was in fact based on Brown (or on Dartmouth, where Marks had previously taught), the book probably did reflect the literary situation at Brown in Bowers's time, as in passages like the following: The wave of materialism was swept back by an inrushing tide of idealism. Students suddenly ceased to concentrate in economics and filled the English and philosophy classes to overflowing. . . . The "Sanford Literary Magazine," which had been slowly perishing for several years, became almost as popular as the "Cap and Bells," the comic magazine, which coined money by publishing risqué jokes and pictures of slightly dressed women. . . . the intelligent majority began to read and discuss books openly, and the intelligent majority ruled the campus. (pp. 228-229) This assessment is supported, from various sources, by Jay Martin in his 1970 biography of Nathanael West, who was in the Brown class of 1924: "Between 1922 and 1924," he says, "Brown was genuinely invaded by modern ideas," producing a "literary awakening" (p. 66). That Marks showed this element of Ivy League college life along with the partying and the snobbishness makes his account considerably more subtle than Upton Sinclair's characterization of Brown—in another contemporary book, The Goose-Step (1923)—as an institution ("almost as snobbish as Princeton") "catering to the sons of the plutocracy" with "a regime of intellectual dry-rot" (pp. 309-310). Although Bowers was one of the students with whom Marks was familiar while the novel was in progress, there is no character in it that seems obviously based on him. The hero, who plans to go to Harvard for graduate work, makes the "long trip" to New York just before graduation to propose marriage to the woman he had taken to the prom the year before, and he is rejected; Bowers's very different excursion to New York to get married occurred ten months after the book was published. Bowers, however, did use the widespread knowledge of Marks's book as the background for twenty-six lines in heroic couplets, entitled "The Plastic Age," which he published in the Brown Jug in February 1925. The opening and closing went as follows: Sing, ye muses, of our college drear, O'erhung by terror and possessed with fear! The liberal spirit slinking through our halls To deaf ears plaintively repeats its calls, It dare not stop or in the open lie, For to be discovered is to die, Our bald head trustees sit upon our needs, And there are none to bite the hand that feeds! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Aflame with bootleg gin we spend the night, A throbbing headache follows on delight, But that is but a trifling price to pay, For we can sleep in classes all next day; Gone is the hardy Baptist true to fear, Alas, alas! The Plastic Age is here! The "headache" no doubt reflected Bowers's own experience, for in later life he told stories about his special recipe for bathtub gin in college. Although he apparently contributed unsigned items (as a "Juggler") to six issues of the Brown Jug , his only other signed piece was a free-verse poem, "A Coat of Arms for Prom Hosts" (May 1924), in pseudo-antique English. In his junior year Bowers appeared three times in Casements , the second appearance causing a considerable sensation. His piece in the January 1924 number (published in December 1923), entitled "The Passing Show," consisted of brief parodies of Frederick O'Brien, Theodore Dreiser, Amy Lowell, and D. H. Lawrence. In the Lawrence parody (based on the rabbit scene in Women in Love , the trade printing of which had been published in America fourteen months before), a man and a woman, standing by a rabbit pen, look at each other "sensually," and "the white arctic snow in him was lit with a rosy flush of passion, like fingers of sunset glow creeping across barren, white wastes." Then they watch a male rabbit "vigorously trying to overtake his frailer paramour," chasing her into "the dusky, dark gloomness" of the rabbit house: "Do you really think that rabbit ran as fast as she could?" he asked soberly. Her long eyes lit up with a flare of obscene mirth. He looked at her, and she looked at him. They knew they were initiates together. She was still looking at him, and her sea green eyes made his flesh tingle. He looked at his watch and swore softly to himself. There were yet three hours more of daylight. This kind of writing was unacceptable to city officials in Providence, and on 22 December the Assistant City Solicitor, declaring the parody to be "clearly obscene and unfit for public reading," ordered that copies of the issue be withdrawn from sale and that uncooperative booksellers and newsdealers be prosecuted (as the Boston Globe reported in some detail the next day). Bowers suspected that his piece was called to the attention of the authorities by his classmate S. J. Perelman as a prank. Many years later Bowers wrote to Dorothy Herrmann, while she was working on her biography of Perelman (1986), describing the episode: Suddenly the Providence chief of police and various ministers started getting anonymous letters protesting the "filth" that was being published on the Hill, and demanding action. So of course the Dean got involved, and the editor of the magazine—Gordon Keith Chalmers, who later became president of Kenyon—and I were hauled on the carpet for an explanation. . . . this is what I then thought to be a typical Perelman jape, writing letters to the clergy and the police in such a high moral tone and demanding action. That is, it was a jape that fitted the Brown Jug's idea of humor. But he never admitted it. (p. 38) Certainly Bowers and Perelman knew each other well at that time, being fellow members of the English and Sphinx clubs and fellow contributors to the Herald , and their college careers continued to intersect. A few months later, when Bowers was chairman of the committee for the 1924 St. Patrick's Day Vaudeville Show (in part a parody of The Plastic Age , and one of the "bawdiest productions ever to be staged at Brown," according to Herrmann), Perelman was the set designer for it—and Quentin Reynolds one of the writers, and Nathanael West an actor in it. (The Herald on 27 March called it "undoubtedly the greatest single theatrical production and the finest example of histrionic art ever seen on the campus.") The following year, when Bowers edited the Herald , Perelman was editor of the Brown Jug ; and Bowers, perhaps in retaliation for the Casements affair, attacked Perelman's handling of the Jug (on 22 November 1924 and 6 January 1925) and initiated an editorial feud between the two publications. (The Herald's [i.e., Bowers's?] criticism of the Jug for being imitative of H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan reinforces Percy Marks's later recollection of his students' papers: "A bundle of themes turned into an American Mercury in my hand" [ The Craft of Writing , 1932].) Bowers's other contributions to Casements , in the numbers for November 1923 and March 1924, were less controversial than his parodies, but perhaps more revealing. The earlier one, "The Street That Ends in the Sea," was a short allegorical piece describing the movements of people roaming a street of shops, with its "crooked bylanes," that led to a "shimmering blue" sea ("promising rest"), which some people glanced at "furtively" and others seemed not to notice at all. The other piece, "Whitney Warren," was a five-page story describing the thoughts going through the mind of a man as he was being hanged for murder. (The naming of the title character suggests that architecture was not one of the arts Bowers followed closely; otherwise he would presumably not have used the name of one of the prominent architects of the day, a partner in the firm of Warren &amp; Wetmore and designer of the facade of Grand Central Terminal.) Whether Warren's thoughts were Bowers's own is difficult to say, but the story can plausibly be seen as an undergraduate's proclamation of his rejection of conventional religion and morality. The title character had "felt no desire" to talk to the chaplain but "had gone through with the interview as an inescapable part of the necessary rigmarole"; his philosophy "had finally matured and hardened into a strange mixture of materialism and individualism." As he died, he felt himself slowly being absorbed into space. There was no Heaven nor Hell, God nor Devil, but simply exhilarating ever-extending space. And as he was sucked out into the tide of the caressing darkness and made one with it, his whole being thrilled with the wordless ecstasy of the one end for which he had hoped. Like Whitney Warren, Bowers may also have "often tried to imagine the beginning of the whole colossal system of the universe"; and he perhaps sympathized with Warren's feeling that he "had loved words and their magic power almost as well as he had loved life itself." At any rate, words were the subject of the one undergraduate piece of Bowers's that reached a sizable national audience. The 14 March 1925 number of the widely circulated Literary Digest , under the heading "College Slang a Language All Its Own," reprinted an article that Bowers had written, "as summarized by the Providence Journal and the Brooklyn Eagle ." In the article as printed there, Bowers wrote that college "slanguage" was "like a foreign tongue even to the graduate of a few years ago, and entirely unintelligible to the outside public." One of the examples he provided was an imaginary conversation beginning, "Why, hello Jim, you're looking pretty smooth to-night. Where'd you get the doggy scarf? Old Joe Brooks himself, aren't you." Whether this article derived from one of Bowers's editorials in the Daily Herald is not certain, but there was an editorial on 23 February 1925 entitled "Diction on the Campus," complaining about college slang, which is "unintelligible to the average man," and lecturing its readers rather pompously on their "responsibility for the precious heritage of the English tongue" (it did not, however, give examples of slang). Bowers must have written many of the editorials during his senior year, and many news stories during his four years on the staff. But most Herald articles were unsigned, and his have not been identified, except for a series of five reviews signed "F.T.B." In a review of Casements , he noted that "S. J. Perelman contributes a divagation in his best manner" (6 May 1924); another review judged May Sinclair's Arnold Waterlow to show "a psychological intuition and perception almost unrivalled among modern authors" (30 September 1924); Anne Douglas Sedgwick's The Little French Girl was "one of the best novels of the present age" (7 October 1924); Ernest Brace's Commencement achieved "a real and interesting picture of life" (10 November 1924); and Sarah Gertrude Millin's God's Stepchildren contained "a breadth of life which can almost be said to be complete" (24 March 1925). Even without knowing more of his Herald pieces, one can nevertheless say that the fluency Bowers gained from all his undergraduate writing, as well as the discipline of meeting deadlines and administering a periodical, proved valuable to him later on. Bowers graduated from Brown with a Ph.B. on 17 June 1925 and turned his thoughts to graduate school at Harvard. He and his wife moved into 10 Dana Street, Cambridge, and he began his coursework in the fall of 1925. It was natural, given his English major at Brown and his interest in writing, that his graduate work would be in English; what led him to concentrate on the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in his first year, however, is not as evident. But after taking George Lyman Kittredge's Shakespeare course and J. Tucker Murray's pre-1642 non-Shakespearean drama course that year, his direction was set. Kittredge made a deep impression on him, and he eventually wrote his dissertation under Kittredge's direction. More than half a century later Bowers recalled with admiration the characteristics of Kittredge's teaching. In the preface to his collected essays on Shakespeare (1989), he said that the essays "share a common background from the active teaching of a relatively few plays in the Kittredge manner of close analysis although with a different focus from his": It used to be a standing joke that George Lyman Kittredge's students, inspired, all went out to teach Shakespeare like him—and promptly failed. In fact, failure could be anticipated because Kittredge's extraordinary memory, reaching to total recall, his thorough philological grounding, his wide reading in classical, medieval, and Renaissance culture, and especially the powerful thrust of his associative and analytical mind, all gathered together in one uniquely forceful teacher—these made him inimitable. Nevertheless, he put a stamp on his students that was permanent. Murray's teaching was also influential: Bowers said in the preface to his dissertation that the topic "would never have been undertaken had not I among so many others fallen under the spell of Professor John Tucker Murray's enthusiasm for the Elizabethan drama"; and a term paper for Murray, growing out of A. H. Thorndike's 1902 PMLA article on "The Relations of Hamlet to the Contemporary Revenge Play," became the germ for the dissertation. Other glimpses of Bowers's study at Harvard occasionally crop up in later writings—as when, in an obituary of Greg (1959), he said, "In the United States of the late 1920's my generation cut its teeth on McKerrow's Introduction ." Another time (in a letter on 18 April 1976), he commented on one of his critics by saying that "he does not know of the philological training one got at Harvard in my day!" This training consisted, in Bowers's case, of a year of Anglo-Saxon (under Kittredge, F. N. Robinson, and Kenneth G. T. Webster), two years of Middle English (one on Chaucer and one on other literature of the period, both taught by Robinson and John S. P. Tatlock), a year of Old French ("Phonology and Inflections" taught by J. D. M. Ford), and a half-year of "Gothic—Introduction to the Study of German Philology" (under R. M. S. Heffner)—the latter a course he postponed taking until the fall of 1931. The other major influence on him at Harvard, besides Kittredge and Murray, was Hyder Edward Rollins, whose year-long course in Elizabethan nondramatic poetry he took in 1927-28, his third year. (Howard Mumford Jones later said that Rollins, "in many minds the successor of Kittredge, was the idol of the graduate students" [ An Autobiography , 1979, p. 204].) At the end of this course, on 3 May 1928, Bowers submitted a remarkable paper of 338 typed pages bound in hard cover—bound at the time he turned it in, for Rollins's comment is on the front free endpaper. Entitled "The Authorship of A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres ," the paper argued against B. M. Ward's suggestion that some of the poems were by other persons than Gascoigne. In his ten-line comment, Rollins said, "A very remarkable study for a mere course-thesis. . . . Congratulations on your interest and industry and intelligence!" Not surprisingly, he gave the paper a grade of A; less expected was his final comment, "Gratifying, too, to see that you write much more carefully since the December jolt!" Presumably the jolt was a severe criticism from him (and perhaps also from Kittredge, with whom Bowers was taking an independent-study course at the same time). Bowers's facility in writing sometimes resulted in a diffuseness that was to be a problem throughout his life, and apparently he was warned about it at this point. The Gascoigne paper is of particular interest for its focus on authorship (which naturally has bibliographical and textual implications) and for such bibliographical knowledge as it reveals—the use of title-page transcription and signature reference notation, for instance. It also contains what is probably the earliest surviving indication of his awareness of W. W. Greg's work: in criticizing Ward's theory of an Oxford code, he said, "Now I protest, even though Greg thinks it good, that this is not an honest cipher" (p. 299). Most of his course-related writing during these years obviously dealt with Elizabethan and Jacobean literature and no doubt underlay his earliest scholarly publications, which began in 1930, while he was engaged in writing his dissertation. His first scholarly article, in the March 1930 number of Modern Language Notes , argued that the anonymous poetic satire Machiavells Dogge (1617) was in fact by Nicholas Breton; the argument used no physical bibliographical evidence but instead relied entirely on the existence of many borrowed passages from an established Breton work and on similarities of tone and style. One of Rollins's editions was cited in a footnote, and an acknowledgment of Rollins's help was made in Bowers's next publication, "Kyd's Pedringano: Sources and Parallels" in Harvard Studies and Notes in Philology and Literature for 1931. Bowers appeared twice more in Harvard Studies , in 1933 and 1934, both articles dealing with attribution of authorship: the earlier ruled out Chapman as author of Alphonsus , and the later was a condensed version of the Gascoigne paper he had written for Rollins (who was one of the editors of Harvard Studies as of 1934). He also published twice more at this time in Modern Language Notes (in 1932 and 1933), referring on the second occasion to Kittredge's assistance, and he placed a substantial article in Studies in Philology (1934). These three pieces dealt with revenge tragedy and were offshoots of his dissertation, "A History of Elizabethan Revengeful Tragedy." (In his preface he credited the origin of his title to a mistaken footnote in Allardyce Nicoll's Restoration Drama , citing a nonexistent book supposedly called "History of Revengeful Drama.") He pursued this topic with the same thoroughness he had displayed in the Gascoigne paper; and in January 1934, after some five years' work, he presented his committee with an 1100-page study (bound in three volumes), dedicated "gratefully" to Kittredge, and was officially awarded his Ph.D. degree in February. His primary acknowledgments (besides the one to Murray) were naturally to Kittredge ("for his unfailing interest, his multitude of valuable suggestions, his careful reading of my manuscript, and for the stimulating hours I have spent in discussion with him") and Rollins ("for reading part of this thesis, for various valuable suggestions, and for his constant inspiration to me as a model of modern scholarship"). At the end of his list he added, "my deepest gratitude is due my wife who undertook, during years of listening to an idée fixe , the arduous work of typing this thesis." The main text consisted of two large sections, one on "The Theory and Practice of Revenge" (a third of the whole), tracing the concept back to antiquity, followed by one on "The Elizabethan Tragedy of Revenge" (some 650 pages), containing (after a discussion of "Antecedents") separate treatments of sixty-five plays. His own four-page epitome of the dissertation appeared in the Summaries of Theses , but an even more condensed statement in his own words can be found in a footnote to his Studies in Philology article: "I am at present completing a history of Elizabethan revenge tragedy from the particular point of view of its relation to the life and ethics of the time and their effect upon its structure, characterization, and ethics." Six years later a shortened version of this work became his first scholarly book. During his nine years of graduate study, he taught at Harvard every year but the first and the last two; while taking courses his title was Assistant in English, and while writing his dissertation he was Instructor in English and Tutor in the Modern Languages. He stayed on in the latter position for two years following the award of his degree and traveled to England in the summer between them (1935) on a Charles Dexter Scholarship (he had also been a Dexter Scholar in the summer of 1928, when he had done research for his dissertation at the British Museum, the Bodleian Library, and the libraries of Emmanuel and Trinity Colleges, Lambeth Palace, and the Guildhall). The Bowerses' first son, Fredson Thayer Bowers, Jr., was born on 7 April 1927, and in mid-1927 the family moved from Dana Street to 5 Concord Avenue. The next year they moved again, to 987 Memorial Drive, where a second child, Joan Sutphen Bowers, was born on 28 February 1931. She later remembered that her father put her to sleep at night by reading Old English poetry to her. One more move, to 110 Forest Avenue in West Newton, came in mid-1931, and on 3 April 1934 twin sons were born, named Peter Dirck Sutphen Bowers and Stephen Hyder Gilbert Bowers (the latter obviously named for Bowers's Harvard adviser Hyder Rollins and his paternal grandmother's family). (The four children made their careers, respectively, in insurance, accounting, finance, and counselling, and they eventually provided Bowers with a total of twenty-two grandchildren.) The move to the suburbs not only accommodated the growing family but allowed Bowers to indulge his love of dogs: the first dog was just a pet for the children, but soon he acquired pure-bred hounds to display in shows. His wife enjoyed golf, tennis, skating, and skiing, and he joined her in these activities and took pictures of her and the children on their various outings. (He later claimed that he gave up golf after he broke par and it no longer seemed a challenge.) His oldest son recently recalled Bowers's enthusiasm for moving pictures: Dad became a proficient, amateur film maker when we were young. He had a Bell &amp; Howell 16 mm camera and projector [then in vogue among knowledgeable home-movie makers] together with bright spotlights for indoor photography. Each film was, for the most part, a complete story (such as a day at kindergarten) and many had titles. Unfortunately, he did most of the photography and my mother was not geared to movie making, so that in 3,600 feet of film one sees only a split second of him skiing down the small hill across the street or the very end of a golf swing, although there is one segment lasting some 20 seconds of the two of us at a sled dog farm in the Adirondacks. When my mother died I discovered a large number of rolls of this film, dusty and many entirely off the reels. I spent one winter cleaning, organizing in chronological order and splicing, and eventually they were transferred to videotape. We have my father to thank for approximately an hour and a half of invaluable family history. The pleasures of family life were not destined to continue, however, for the Bowerses began to have marital problems, and they separated in 1935 and were divorced on 29 January 1936. Bowers had moved back into Cambridge, and his wife and the children stayed on in the West Newton house, where she continued to live until near the time of her death from arteriosclerosis on 13 May 1967. (She was married again on 17 October 1940, to Edward Bass Hall, and was divorced from him in 1946.) For the 1936-37 academic year, Bowers accepted an instructorship at Princeton; his move in the summer of 1936 ended an eleven-year association with Harvard, and with an area that held many family memories. During the Harvard years Bowers developed an interest in Irish wolfhounds and pursued this interest with great intensity, fitting it into a life already crowded with family activities, graduate studies, and teaching. This avocation is the best documented early instance of his drive toward professionalism, or at least mastery and authority, in any field that captured his attention. No doubt this trait of his personality had shown itself previously (and was in part responsible for his energetic undergraduate writing career), but it left its earliest permanent mark in connection with dogs, for his first book was on this subject. In late 1932, at a dog show in Boston, he saw some of the Irish wolfhounds belonging to Charles D. Burrage, Jr. (who was to become one of the prominent breeders of these hounds, at his Rathain Kennels in Needham Heights, not far from where Bowers lived); and as Bowers said in his earliest writing for the American Kennel Gazette (March 1934), "It was a case of love at first sight." He received expert advice both from Burrage and from Frank T. Eskrigge, a veteran dog-show judge and dog-magazine writer who also lived nearby (in Newton Centre); and under their tutelage he made—in the spring of 1933—an impeccable entry into the world of pure-bred dogs by importing a male, Sulhamstead Gala, from Florence Nagle, whose Sulhamstead Kennels (near Reading in Berkshire) were to become as celebrated a source of champions as she herself was to become a colorful and outspoken figure among dog- and horse-fanciers. A few months later, in the summer of 1933, he bought another male, Whippoorwill Major Kilkelly, bred by Mrs. Amory L. Haskell at her Whippoorwill Kennels in Red Bank, N.J., and at the end of the year he imported a bitch, Sulhamstead Kiora, from Mrs. Nagle. In the March 1934 article he described these three hounds in detail, emphasizing Gala, whose "head has been rather generally admired": "He is a light cream color, with just a suspicion of grey brindle on the underthroat and a tail which darkens to black at the tip." Bowers broke off his description with the comment, "He's so much my favorite that I can't say anything more about him without going into a rhapsody." The same article provides some delightful glimpses into Bowers's life at this time: I live in West Newton, Mass., a suburb of Boston, and, unfortunately, the land is pretty well built up. I am able, however, to have a run about 150 feet by 50 for the dogs, and since there is hardly any traffic nearby, I often let one out alone, to roam as he pleases. Since I am fortunate in having some leisure, I am able to give all three regular exercise by walking with me, almost every day, for several miles. They have quickly picked up the elementary training of staying on the same side of the street with me—as they go without leashes—and of stopping at corners on command—and often without—until told to cross. I will admit that the sight of another dog rather upsets the rules, unless I see it first and get in the commands to heel before they have a chance to be off. . . . Now that the golf season is in abeyance, I take them to a neighboring course where they romp over the fairways and have a gorgeous time. They are outdoors all day, but come in for the evening with me where they behave themselves as quietly and decorously as could be desired until taken out to their quarters again at bed time. I like to take one or more with me when I go out, and so far my friends haven't barred their doors. The hounds like to ride in the car. It's surprising how well two can curl up on the back seat of a smallish sedan, and I've even had three in the car without discomfort on their parts. All three are beloved by my two small children, and they get on famously together. Although one wonders how Bowers could have had "some leisure" during this period, he obviously enjoyed walking the dogs and making them good pets as well as show dogs. His reference here to taking them on sidewalks anticipates another article of his in the American Kennel Gazette a few months later (October 1934) on "Training Dogs for the Street," which is accompanied by six wonderfully evocative photographs of Bowers's dogs, the West Newton neighborhood, Bowers's oldest son (then seven years old), and Bowers himself. Anyone who knew Bowers, or his writings, later can easily imagine that he was good at disciplining his dogs: "I have never," he says in this article, "found the necessity of punishing my dogs, except with a scolding." By early 1934 Bowers had worked out his plans as a breeder: My ambition is to establish a strain stemming from Conncara [Sulhamstead Conncara, the primary basis for the fame of the line bred by Mrs. Nagle] —with the creams and reds of which I am so fond—on the one side and Kilmorac [of the historic Felixstowe Kennels in England] on the other. So if Kiora doesn't prove in whelp, I intend to breed her, in June, either to my Gala or to some good dog in this country descended from Kilmorac, and probably to keep a dog for showing with Gala and perhaps a bitch for breeding. Kiora was not in whelp (though Bowers had already advertised for sale "a few Irish Wolfhound puppies imported in utero"), and Bowers's program changed slightly. He bought Top Lady of Ambleside from Mr. and Mrs. L. O. Starbuck's famous Ambleside Kennels of Augusta, Michigan, and bred her to a dog called Brian Boru (owned by Mrs. Randolph C. Grew); on 6 September 1934, Top Lady produced a litter of seven, which Bowers named Ban, Brian, Deirdre, Graysteel, Juno, Morhault, and Shaun, each one with the suffix "of the Fen" attached ("Ban of the Fen," etc.). Early in 1935 he bred Top Lady to his own Sulhamstead Gala, and a litter of five resulted on 12 March 1935—named Cabal, Dark Rosaleen, Degare, Hodain, and Yseult (again, "of the Fen"). To announce the availability of these puppies, he took a full-page advertisement in the 1934-35 volume of Annual Reports of the Irish Wolfhound Club of America (IWCA), headed "The Irish Wolfhounds of the Fen," showing a picture of Kiora and noting that Bedlington terrier puppies were "occasionally available." Meanwhile he had shown Gala extensively (and Kiora somewhat less so), beginning with the Bridgewater (Massachusetts) Kennel Club show on 2 September 1933. By mid-1934 Gala had been shown sixteen times in seven states and on 20 July 1934 earned the last of the requisite points to become a champion of American Kennel Club record (the thirty-fifth Irish wolfhound to achieve this status). Although Bowers showed Gala several more times, he began to be asked to judge Irish wolfhounds and in 1935 appeared at two shows as judge rather than exhibitor—the beginning of what was to be a long association with dog-show judging. Bowers became well known in dog circles not only because he possessed a champion but also because he wrote about dogs with some frequency. Besides his article on training dogs for the street, he published a piece entitled "Novices All Need the Sympathetic Judging of Their Dogs" ( American Kennel Gazette , April 1935)—full of eminently sensible advice that suggests how thoughtfully Bowers approached his own duties as a judge. When he returned from his summer in England in 1935, he wrote for the Annual Reports of the IWCA a fascinating account of the various kennels he had visited abroad (he was also a member of the Irish Wolfhound Club in England) and the shows he had attended there ("English Notes and Comments"). His love of dogs showed through clearly in everything he wrote about them, as in this concluding sentence of that essay: it was a very warming sensation to experience as I did unfailingly the constant courtesy and friendliness of the English breeders and to transmit to owners on this side of the ocean their sincere interest, encouragement, and sympathy with our efforts to breed and to popularize the very finest specimens possible of the noblest of all dogs, the love of which makes any nation kin. In addition to submitting articles to the American Kennel Gazette , he was assiduous in sending accounts of his activities to L. O. Starbuck, who conducted the column on Irish wolfhounds, and several of his letters were quoted there. The August 1935 column consisted entirely of Bowers's description of the Irish Wolfhound Association of New England, which he had been instrumental in forming the previous November; he wrote the June 1936 column on the subject of coursing; and in the September 1936 column Starbuck quoted Bowers's description and analysis of the stuffed specimens he had seen the previous summer in London at the Museum of Natural History. In that same column Starbuck said, "I have to credit Fredson Bowers with the most marked loyalty to the breed in helping to furnish something of interest from time to time." His principal writing on dogs while still at Harvard was a book-length general introduction to all breeds, which he dedicated to his dog-world mentor Frank Eskrigge and which Houghton Mifflin published as The Dog Owner's Handbook in October 1936 (just after he had begun teaching at Princeton). The front of the dust jacket was labeled "A Guaranteed Dog Book," and the flap explained, "Any purchaser who is not satisfied with it may return the book within five days for refund." In the preface he stated his qualifications for producing a work "squarely intended for the average pet dog owner or the person thinking of buying a dog": I have progressed from owning one pet dog, and then in rapid succession several more, to the stage where I am breeding for a purpose and have dogs about me continually. That some of my dogs are raised at home and that I have not instituted regular kennel conditions, and that these dogs for the show ring are still treated as pet dogs, makes me somewhat closer, I feel, to the average owner and perhaps a little better suited to consider his problems than the average kennelman, professional breeder, or veterinarian. In my treatment of my own dogs I have tried to balance the theory gained from extended reading with the practical experience which is never ended with dogs until the owner departs from this world. This combination of "theory" with "practical experience" was to be a hallmark of his writing from then on: he was not temperamentally attracted to theory for its own sake, as he often pointed out, and his works are filled with illustrative examples drawn from his own experience. He vowed in this preface to eschew "windy generalities" and to speak frankly about the merits and demerits of individual breeds, risking "the charge of personal prejudice" in order "to be of as great help as possible" through his own "experience with several breeds, a fairly intimate acquaintance with many, and observation of the rest." In a straightforward, serviceable style (addressing the reader in the second person), he covered all the expected topics, from selecting dogs to training and showing them; the heart of the book was a long chapter on "The Dogs Themselves," describing the history, uses, and characteristics of forty-two breeds and offering advice about each. Bowers's partiality for the Irish wolfhound came through in his account of it as a "thoroughly satisfactory dog in every way. No owner ever changes to any other large breed" (p. 69). Another similar—and similarly titled—book (but more technical and more suited for the kennel owner), Josephine Z. Rine's The Dog Owner's Manual , was brought out by Coward-McCann at almost precisely the same time. Frank Dole reviewed both books (and five other more specialized ones) in the book section of the New York Herald Tribune on 20 December 1936, praising them both but treating Bowers's first and calling it one of the better of the Christmas books "for the person not very well acquainted with the field." He found Bowers's book "capably done" and "written so that the reader incurs a natural desire to learn more of the intricacies of dogdom." The book had some success, for it was reprinted by the Sun Dial Press in 1940 and was still mentioned in the 1950s in some of the lists of recommended books that appeared in the American Kennel Club's magazine. During 1935 Bowers sold many of his puppies, and in March of 1936, following his divorce and in anticipation of his move to Princeton, he sold his remaining hounds. (Both Sulhamstead Kiora and Top Lady of Ambleside became champions later that year.) Bowers's oldest son recently recalled, "When the dogs and puppies were sold, I more or less inherited the dog house, and a dozen or so of us neighborhood children used it as a clubhouse"—the structure being "eight or nine feet long" and "six feet wide and six feet high," with "two levels, a door and window high up at each end for ventilation." From time to time after that, Bowers considered owning some hounds once more: Alma J. Starbuck (L. O. Starbuck's widow) said, in her November 1947 report on the Specialty Show held two months earlier, "It was good to see Fredson Bowers again, looking quite the same and letting us know it's just a question of a little time before he will again have a Wolfhound on the lead." But he never did; from 1936 on, his activities in the dog world were limited to writing and judging, though he did a considerable amount of both. After writing two more columns for the American Kennel Gazette (in January 1937 a thoughtful piece on the relative popularity of Irish wolfhounds among American dog owners, and in July an account of the latest Morris and Essex Kennel Club show, the first major show that he had judged), Bowers was chosen by Alma Starbuck as her successor to handle this column. In the December 1937 number Bowers wrote: It came as a considerable shock to me to read in the November Gazette's column that Mrs. Starbuck was going to relinquish this space after so many years of friendly and continually interesting service. Of course, I was very interested in who was the unfortunate person relegated the task of maintaining the pace after the First Lady of our Irish Wolfhound ranks. I discovered who, in my morning mail a week later. Fortunately, I'm as sorry for the readers as I am for myself. After asking for contributions, he warned his readers, "My main business is mounting the lecture platform, and if you all don't combine to keep me off it here, on your own heads be it"; and he then reported on the Richmond show that he had attended on his visit to England in the summer of 1937, recognizing that the English level "is still way and above ours." For the next three years, through the December 1940 column (when Bowers wrote, "And, Santa Claus, give us a new columnist"), Bowers conducted the column vigorously, missing only September and October of 1938 (because of his move to Virginia), July through October 1939 (because of a trip to England), and July 1940. These thirty columns, totaling about 30,000 words, covered such topics as current shows (e.g., January and April 1938 and March 1940, the latter dealing with a show he judged), the formation of a Mid-Atlantic Irish Wolfhound Association (July 1938), coursing (August 1938), Irish wolfhound history (June 1939, a column that links Bowers's literary and canine interests with its report of a previously unnoticed reference to the breed in Wycherley's The Gentleman Dancing Master of 1672), the hardiness of the breed (November 1939 and January 1940), and the economics of wolfhound-raising (December 1939, where Bowers says that the hound "still remains the best of all the large breeds, but he simply has not been sold to the public as the Great Dane has been"). (Bowers also treated the history of Irish wolfhounds in a major article in the May 1939 number.) The subject that came up most often, however, in about a dozen of the columns, was the possible revision of the official standard of excellence for Irish wolfhounds. Bowers's view (February 1938) was that, although the sixty-year-old standard was out of date, it should probably be retained "as an historical document" and should be provided with "a series of supplementary notes which can be printed with the standard as a fuller and more complete guide to the ideal of the Irish wolfhound." That Bowers should have involved himself actively in this matter is not surprising, for his mind was attracted to categorization and systematization, and the problem was not unlike the bibliographical question he later addressed concerning the description of "ideal" copies of books, abstracted from the idiosyncrasies of actual surviving copies. In one of his most thoughtful columns on the wolfhound standard (January 1939), he wrote that "it is of the utmost importance that a clear and reasonably definite set of rules be laid down for judging any breed if the great benefit which dog shows confer upon improving the breed is not to turn into a boomerang by reason of such diverse judging that no practical ideal can be ascertained." He continued his analysis of points not adequately covered in the old standard through three more columns in the spring of 1939 (March, April, May); a year later (April 1940) he was glad to report that a committee had been formed to look into this question ("a project very close to my heart"), and he made additional comments throughout that year, especially on the need for cooperation (May) and the treatment of the size of wolfhounds (September, October). Even after he gave up his column, he still pursued the subject: in the volume of Annual Reports of the IWCA for 1939-40 (published 1941), he included in his list of desiderata for the Club the impatient statement, "it is time that we took some definite action or decided definitely to take no action"; and after the war, when new standards of weight and height were adopted, he wrote some "Random Notes on the Standard" ( Annual Reports , 1946-47), in which he made further specific suggestions for revision and advocated that an interpretive section be added. From then on, the only writings on dogs that Bowers published were the occasional accounts of shows that he judged. Although he was not a particularly active judge, his judging career spanned a thirty-year period, from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s (he was one of the first six judges approved by the IWCA, and he was included in the official lists of American Kennel Club licensed judges from 1936 through 1973—qualified to judge borzois, Great Pyrenees, and Scottish deerhounds, as well as Irish wolfhounds). Among the shows he judged were the Greenwich in 1936 and 1938 (the presence of Raymond Whitney's Silver making the latter "a sentimental occasion," he said in his August 1938 column, "as I afterwards found he is a son of my now deceased Ch. Sulhamstead Gala"), the Morris and Essex and the Philadelphia in 1937, the Westminster in 1940, the IWCA Specialty in 1948 and 1954, and the Long Island in 1964 and 1966. In the 1940s his influence was also felt through his service on the Governing Committee of the IWCA. Even though the period of Bowers's intense activity in the dog world was relatively brief, he made a lasting place for himself in the annals of Irish wolfhounds through the calibre of the hounds he owned and bred, the attention his writings and opinions received, and the length of his career as a judge. Alma J. Starbuck, in The Complete Irish Wolfhound (1963), devoted a paragraph to Bowers in her historical section: Fredson Thayer Bowers became active at this time with his "of the Fen" Wolfhounds. Mr. Bowers was a great force in helping spread Wolfhound knowledge and the club was fortunate that his scholarly articles on the breed were published. He bred some good Hounds, and had both imported dogs and home-breds. Mr. Bowers was an authority on the breed, and judged some of the important fixtures. When in 1976 the IWCA celebrated its fiftieth anniversary with a special number of its journal, Harp &amp; Hound , five pages of excerpts from Bowers's writings were included—an honor accorded to no one else. Besides several other scattered quotations from him and a picture of him at the 1954 Specialty Show, this number contained, in its account of "The First Decade" by Mrs. Kelly Fox, an informative assessment of his contribution: In 1930 [i.e., 1934], Fredson T. Bower[s]'s first scholarly treatises on the breed appeared, and soon his voice in Club matters was heard. It was largely through his efforts that the only alteration in the wording of the Breed Standard of Excellence was ratified by the Irish Wolfhound Club of Americ[a], i.e., "Number one, General Appearance", formerly read "the Irish Wolfhound should not be so heavy or massive as the Great Dane, but more so than the Deerhound, which in general type, he should otherwise resemble", was altered to "the Irish Wolfhound is remarkable in combining power and swiftness with keen sight. The largest and tallest of the galloping hounds in general type he is a rough coated grey hound-like breed". His explanations of his position on this and other matters received wide exposure. Mr. Bowers was a tireless proponent of his own advanced thinking on the Wolfhound and allied matters, and seemed to be invariably faced with unanimous disagreement, but would press on, putting forth his reasoning and conclusions, with no hint of self-righteousness. Today he is proven to have been forward thinking. He never tilted at windmills but he did wound a few sacred cows. . . . Mrs. Starbuck, years later, was to write of him what she did of no other, "The Club was fortunate that his scholarly artic[l]es were published. He was an authority on the breed." Bowers's position at the center of controversy in the dog world of the 1930s and 1940s, as described here, foreshadowed his position in the world of textual scholarship in the 1960s and later. Most of the scholars who debated textual issues with him, however, had no idea that he had also played an authoritative role in a very different field. Bowers moved into 50 University Place, Princeton, in the summer of 1936. In his two years at Princeton, his course load consisted of two classes of freshman English (actually literature), three sophomore preceptorials, and a section of English A, the noncredit remedial course. Despite this heavy schedule, and his dog columns and dog-show judging, he accomplished a considerable amount of research, notably some of the early stages of the work leading toward his edition of Dekker. (In the first volume of that edition, when published in 1953, he thanked the Princeton University Library staff for acquiring microfilms of copies of early Dekker editions for his use.) One sign of his concentration on Dekker at this time was a journalistic piece on The Shoemaker's Holiday that he wrote for the Sunday arts section of the New York Times (26 December 1937), as well as three scholarly articles on Dekker. (In the Times piece, he asserted that "Dekker is among the select few [of Shakespeare's contemporaries] who can boldly face the glare of modern foot-lights.") Altogether nearly a dozen (mostly short) scholarly articles of his appeared in print during the two Princeton years (eight in 1937 alone), though many of them had of course been written at Harvard. (Legend has it that Bowers filled his Princeton colleagues' mailboxes with more offprints than they perhaps desired.) These articles came out in major journals, like Journal of English and Germanic Philology and Studies in Philology , and dealt largely with revenge tragedy (and duelling), Gascoigne, and Thomas Randolph (to whom Bowers attributed The Fary Knight , the manuscript of which he had examined in the Folger Library, decided to edit, and described in a paper called "A Long Lost Elizabethan Play" at the Modern Language Association convention on 29 December 1936). Most of these pieces illustrate what he said of his early writings in a 1957 account of his career (written to accompany grant applications): "Before the late 1930's . . . I was chiefly interested in the sociological background of Renaissance English Drama and in the artistic forms of its tragedy." The most important of his articles at this time, in terms of his future career, was "Bibliographical Problems in Dekker's Magnificent Entertainment ," his first truly bibliographical article and his first appearance in The Library , the journal of the Bibliographical Society in London. The date of the number in which it was published, December 1936, shows that it had been written while he was still at Harvard, and it provides the best evidence that his mind had begun turning toward analytical bibliography at that time. In his 1957 autobiographical statement, he recalled that "in the late 1930's, coincidental with my starting on post-doctoral research leading to an edition of the Plays of Thomas Dekker, my work in large part switched towards discovering new techniques in analytical (critical) bibliography to apply to problems of textual criticism." Clearly one of his projects as a Dexter Scholar in England in the summer of 1935 was the examination of multiple copies of The Magnificent Entertainment , for he reported having collated the copies in the Bodleian, the British Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Whether he saw W. W. Greg on that trip or simply corresponded with him is not clear, but his first footnote began, "Dr. W. W. Greg has pointed out to me. . . ." The article (seven short pages) recorded the places where the two 1604 London editions show the same setting of type and conjectured that, in order to speed the production of the second edition, the type that remained standing had been transferred from the shop of Thomas Creede (the printer named on the title page of the first edition) to that of Edward Allde (the printer named on the title page of the second). This reasoning is unconvincing, as Greg was quick to point out. The next number of The Library (March 1937) printed his three-page letter to the editor showing that "Mr. Bowers's analysis of the bibliographical problems involved in the two London editions can be carried somewhat further and the results presented in somewhat simpler and more significant form." The key point that Bowers had missed was stated by Greg at the outset: "it is clear that neither edition was the work of a single press." On the basis of an examination of the types in the headlines, Greg could divide the first edition into the work of five printers and the second edition into the work of four of those five. He also explained why the evidence supports the view—contrary to Bowers—"that the sheets were printed in the houses where the type was set, and that it was the printed sheets and not the formes of type that were collected in one office." With his usual severity—but with good reason—Greg called Bowers's arguments for the transfer of the type "wholly irrelevant." And he was right to question this extraordinarily careless sentence of Bowers's: "With sig. C1, which is reprinted page for page but not wholly line for line, the text of the two editions is finally joined signature for signature" (to which Greg responded, "I am not at all sure that I know what this means"). Greg's letter was simpler, clearer, and more plausible than Bowers's article, and its masterly handling of bibliographical evidence was unquestionably seen by Bowers as an object lesson (despite the fact that he thought Greg had not been entirely fair in dealing with the situation). Bowers's inauspicious debut as a bibliographical writer was, given his temperament, a stimulus to learn more: from the point of view of bibliographical history, Greg's criticism was the most significant event of Bowers's two years at Princeton. In his second year at Princeton, Bowers was offered a position for the following fall as Acting Assistant Professor at the University of Virginia by James Southall Wilson (Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies), who apparently had in mind that Bowers might succeed John Calvin Metcalf, then in his early seventies (and scheduled to retire in 1940). Bowers accepted the offer and in the summer of 1938 moved to Charlottesville, which was to remain his home for the rest of his life. Bowers had liked Wilson immediately; they became close friends and had many occasions to work together until Wilson's retirement in 1951 (at the age of seventy). One mark of Bowers's fondness and respect for Wilson was his assuming the editorship of a festschrift for Wilson in 1951; another was his preparing the official memorial resolution when Wilson died in 1963. At that time (28 June 1963) he wrote Wilson's widow, "I have always loved and revered him. He was the cause of my coming to the University, and he was an important reason why I stayed, perhaps the most important reason. I have always said that he was one of the three or four authentically great men whom I have known in my lifetime." (In 1969 Bowers was one of the people who caused the new English department building to be named "Wilson Hall," and at the dedication ceremony Bowers was visibly moved.) Bowers's first address in Charlottesville was 27 University Circle, and after a year he moved to Fontaine Avenue—both locations near the university. In addition to freshman English, the first courses he taught were the undergraduate survey of the seventeenth century and the graduate course in the eighteenth-century novel. During his second year (after the summer of 1939 in France and England), he arranged to have a course in bibliography announced for the succeeding year, and the university bulletin for 1940-41 duly listed him as the teacher of an advanced graduate-level course entitled "Introduction to Bibliographical Research," with the following description, undoubtedly written by Bowers himself: The course will investigate methods of book-printing in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries as determined by bibliographical evidence. Specific bibliographical problems, some relating directly to textual criticism, will be assigned; practical studies will be made in paleography and in the editing of texts, with special attention to the principles of collation and emendation. Textbook: Introduction to Bibliography by R. B. McKerrow. In the next year, when "Acting" had been dropped from his title, he offered this course again, but the bulletin announced that henceforth he would teach it in alternate years, with an advanced course on pre-1642 non-Shakespearean drama in between ("either course," it added, "will be offered in the off-year at the request of five or more students"). The drama course had formerly been taught by Metcalf (though Bowers modified its description by including as one topic the "transmission of dramatic texts"), and Bowers was now officially assigned to three more of Metcalf's graduate courses—on Spenser and Milton, on Elizabethan poetry and prose, and on seventeenth-century literature. He also was listed for a new introductory research methods course, in which one element was "Study of the history of the printed book from the incunabula period to the present day, with some consideration of principles of textual criticism." Within his first four years at Virginia, therefore, he taught, or was scheduled to teach, most of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century courses, excluding Shakespeare, and had the opportunity to discuss textual criticism in them, as well as in two methodological courses of his own creation. During these same years several significant scholarly publications of his appeared. The most substantial was the revised version of his dissertation, published by Princeton University Press in 1940 as Elizabethan Revenge Tragedy, 1587-1642 . The 300-page book was appropriately dedicated to his dissertation adviser, Kittredge, whom Bowers further acknowledged in his preface (dated 20 January 1940) for "the searching criticism and the numerous suggestions which he lavished on the earliest version of this work." Bowers also thanked Rollins and two former Princeton colleagues, Hoyt Hudson and Thomas Parrott, among others, for having "read and criticized" the manuscript "in various stages," and he noted that his former wife ("Mrs. Sutphen Bowers") had "typed several early drafts." The book followed the same general plan as the dissertation, but with all the discussions considerably condensed; as before, the examination of individual plays was the heart of the study, and the book managed to consider all but eight or nine of the sixty-five plays discussed in the dissertation. Bowers's treatment began with the code of blood-revenge and the influence of Seneca; he then examined the Hamlet story and Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy and detailed their progeny in four periods (the focus moving from moral hero to villain to propaganda and back to revenge, but now without an ethical dimension); and he ended with the decline of the tradition in the "empty ingenuity and worn-out tragic conventions which had lost all touch with the problems of human life and ethics, and all interest in the human soul." (These closing words of the book are practically the same as those of his dissertation and of its published summary in 1935.) Although the categorization underlying the structure of the book was criticized by M. C. Bradbrook in an unfavorable assessment in Review of English Studies (1941), and although Una Ellis-Fermor (in Modern Language Review , 1941) felt that Bowers had neglected English scholarship, the book was greeted with enthusiasm by a number of reviewers. Willard Farnham, for instance, commenting in Modern Language Quarterly (1940), felt that such a book "was waiting to be written"; and Hazelton Spencer called it "a better outline of the subject and a better description of its principal features than has hitherto been available" ( Modern Language Notes , 1940). One part of Spencer's praise probably gave Bowers particular pleasure: the book, Spencer said, besides being necessary for "every specialist," is one that general readers interested in Shakespeare "should find rewarding and much less difficult than academic monographs are popularly supposed to be." It has indeed continued to have an audience: the Peter Smith firm reprinted it in 1959, and Princeton brought it out in paperback in 1966, at which time John Lawlor called it "a classic contribution to the study of Elizabethan drama" ( Critical Quarterly , 1968). More recently George L. Geckle said that the book "has done as much as any single work of dramatic criticism in this century to establish the 'great tragic theme' of those earlier centuries." For the 1959 reprint Bowers had a note (dated September 1958) printed in the lower margin of page 9, issuing a "warning" to the reader that his discussion had been written before "the derived nature of the First Quarto Hamlet text" was established; for the Princeton paperback (which went through several printings), he appended to the preface a postscript (dated November 1965) noting that he had made minor changes on five pages (those on pages 85-86 handled the Hamlet matter) and declaring that he could not "disown" the book, "however much one may wish to treat one's early ventures in publication as by-blows." A second notable publication of these years was the edition of The Fary Knight , a previously unpublished play attributed to Thomas Randolph, that Bowers published in 1942 as the second monograph in the series of "University of Virginia Studies." He had begun work on the edition while still at Princeton, for his letter in the Times Literary Supplement on 17 April 1937 stated that he was "engaged on a critical edition of this play," and he had published five articles on Randolph since then. In working on Randolph, Bowers was following in Rollins's foot-steps (Rollins had edited Randolph's The Drinking Academy in 1930, while Bowers was at Harvard), and Bowers dedicated his edition to Rollins. (He also acknowledged the help of Kittredge and Greg, among many others.) The text of the Folger manuscript, as he described it, was a revised version (revised by someone other than Randolph) of what "probably represents Randolph's earliest known attempt at the dramatic form"; and in endnotes he provided numerous parallel passages from other works of Randolph and other writers. Although he had described his project in 1937 as a "critical edition," the text as it was completed four years later (the preface is dated May 1941) was "a word-for-word and line-for-line transcript," with "necessary corrections" placed in footnotes, along with a record of the revisions on the manuscript. This edition, the first in what would eventually be a long series of editions from Bowers, was uncharacteristic of his later work in presenting a diplomatic reprint as its main text, rather than a critical text incorporating his own emendations. But it did adumbrate his later concerns in its attention to the description of manuscript alterations: the footnotes recording cancellations and interlineations display the earliest stage in an evolving system for dealing with the problem. J. B. Leishman, who reviewed the edition unfavorably in Review of English Studies (1944), regarded the attribution to Randolph as "both improbable and unnecessary" and found the play itself to be of "no literary value" and to hold "little interest of any kind"; the diplomatic transcription, he believed, was carried out with "unnecessary scrupulosity." Alfred Harbage (in Modern Language Notes , 1944) was less severe, but he also was not entirely convinced by the attribution; he was willing to believe, however, that Bowers's "earnest conviction doggedly presented" did establish a "possibility," and he found the editing "meticulously" carried out. Among Bowers's nine other contributions to scholarly periodicals during these years (besides those on Randolph), two are particularly important for the history of bibliography: his article in The Library of December 1938 on running-titles as bibliographical evidence and his paper on headlines (of which running-titles are a part) read before the English Institute at Columbia University on 9 September 1941. The former was his first major contribution to the methodology of analyzing the physical evidence in books, and the two together, along with a paper by his student Charlton Hinman (also delivered at the 1941 English Institute), established the examination of running-titles as a tool of bibliographical analysis. Running-titles had to be set in type several times in order to be placed at the heads of the several type-pages that would be on the press simultaneously, and sometimes several more were set for use with the type to be printed on the other side of the sheet; but once set, these running-titles were normally reused throughout the printing of a book, and patterns in the recurrence of individual running-titles can reveal facts about the printing process, as Bowers showed. Although the reuse of running-titles had been noticed by A. W. Pollard by at least 1909 (in Shakespeare Folios and Quartos ) and had been referred to by several other bibliographers in the intervening years (as Bowers noted), there had been no extensive treatment of its value as bibliographical evidence before Bowers's. Headline analysis has since become one of the basic techniques of bibliographical investigation. The background of that 1938 article offers some insight into Bowers's bibliographical education—and, indeed, into the passion of his later advocacy of bibliographical research. What happened was that, while still at Princeton, he had published a second brief piece in The Library ("Thomas Dekker: Two Textual Notes," in the December 1937 number), concluding that the Dyce copy of Dekker's The Roaring Girle (1611) contained the later state of the inner forme of sheet I. His conclusion was based on what seemed to be "corrected" readings in the Dyce copy; but it was shown to be faulty by James G. McManaway of the Folger Library in the September 1938 number of The Library , which appeared shortly after Bowers's arrival in Charlottesville. Using running-title evidence, McManaway demonstrated that, contrary to what the textual evidence seemed to suggest, sheet I in the Dyce copy was in the earlier state. McManaway, six years older than Bowers, was clearly the mentor here, as his first footnote suggested: The problem came to my attention when Mr. Bowers wrote, pointing out that two settings of the running-title might be identified in The Roaring Girle , and asked my opinion about the order in which certain formes of the play had been printed. My reply took, in part, the form of a dummy of the quarto on which I noted the occurrence on each page of one of the seven varieties of the running-title, which I described. In a day or two he sent me a discarded proof of his article referred to above and questioned my identification of the settings of the running-title on I1 v and I4. With his table of variants before me, I re-examined the Folger quarto and the Farmer facsimile of the British Museum copy (which suffers from cropping) and formed the opinions to be given below. These I forwarded at once to Mr. Bowers, but since The Library was already in the mails he could not modify his printed conclusions. He in turn loaned me his photostat of part of the Huntington copy and gave me a report of his examination of the copy owned by Mr. Carl Pforzheimer of New York City. Bowers learned his lesson and, in his 1941 paper on headlines, said that he still remembered "with considerable ruefulness" his earlier treatment of The Roaring Girle : Guiltless at that time of a knowledge of headlines, I decided on what seemed decisive internal evidence in favor of one state as being the later, only to have Dr. McManaway expose my ignorance by showing that the resetting of the pages in the inner forme had also included the resetting of the headlines and that these new and different headlines appeared not only in the outer forme of sheet I but also in both formes of sheet K. Thus the state with the altered two headlines which printed the next forme and the next and following sheets (the original two headlines disappearing completely) must be the later state, and by bad luck it was the state which I had thought was the earlier. This example furnishes an object lesson in the need for checking "internal evidence" by bibliographical evidence whenever possible. (pp. 196-197) When Bowers collected this piece in his 1975 Essays , he added a further recollection: "it was this salutary correction of my error (which had been printed) coming on top of W. W. Greg's correction of another bibliographical mistake I had made about Dekker's Magnificent Entertainment that first suggested to me I had better learn something about bibliography if I were going to edit Elizabethan plays" (pp. 205-206). (McManaway's article relayed an additional criticism from Greg—that "Mr. Bowers was ill advised to offer as bibliographical evidence" the long dash on 4 in the Dyce copy, since long dashes and rows of hyphens were used indiscriminately throughout.) The lasting impression that these corrections made on Bowers is suggested by his commenting on the matter another time in his collected volume: he added a new footnote to the opening essay, referring to the correction of an error he made using "pseudo-critical evidence" in his "first fumbling approach to the text of Thomas Dekker" and concluding, "This and another salutary shock of the same nature assisted me to become a bibliographer" (p. 8). It seems fitting, in the light of Bowers's subsequent major achievement in editing Dekker, that his serious entry into the bibliographical world was occasioned by his earliest publications on Dekker; and it was characteristic of him, feeling rebuked for overlooking bibliographical evidence in his first two appearances in the premier bibliographical journal, to proceed promptly to make himself into an authority on the subject. He did not hesitate to use these two episodes as an example of how easily one can be misled by neglecting physical evidence; and this personal experience no doubt underlay the strength of his drive to promote a broader awareness of analytical bibliography. Another early instance of such promotion, besides the two articles on headlines, occurred in a 1942 omnibus review of eight books for Modern Language Notes . In the course of discussing Clare Howard's edition of The Poems of Sir John Davies , Bowers wrote, In these bibliographical days there is much to be said for such facsimile editions; but an editor, in my opinion, should not therefore be released from the labor of collation to determine whether the formes are corrected or invariant, so that the most correct original text may be made available; nor should all possible emendations be ruled out from the notes. We need a philosophy of editing facsimile texts, and such editors must recognize that they have further bibliographical duties than merely printing the text in facsimile, especially when no other good editions, as here, are available to the scholar. This passage, significant for its date, shows Bowers's early perception of neglected bibliographical issues; the problem of the variant forme in a facsimile edition was a subject that he and Charlton Hinman were to confront in detail later on. The early 1940s may have seemed to him at the time as "these bibliographical days"; but after the war the days would become much more bibliographical, in no small part because of his own activities. In these early years in Charlottesville, Bowers became acquainted with Nancy Hale, another New Englander transplanted to Virginia. She was a member of an illustrious family: Nathan Hale, the Revolutionary patriot, was the great-uncle of her grandfather (she later said—in New England Discovery [1963]—that as she grew up the American Revolution seemed "almost a family affair"); Harriet Beecher Stowe was her great-great-aunt; Edward Everett, president of Harvard, was her great-great-uncle; Lucretia Peabody Hale, author of The Peterkin Papers , was her great-aunt; Edward Everett Hale, prominent minister and author of "The Man without a Country," was her grandfather; and her parents, Philip Leslie Hale and Lilian Westcott Hale, were both well-known painters (her mother was a particularly successful portrait painter; her father, whose work was included in the 1913 Armory Show, also wrote art criticism and taught at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts). By the time Bowers met her, Nancy Hale (who was three years younger than Bowers, having been born on 6 May 1908) had already published two novels and a collection of short stories, and she was trying to finish a long third novel while raising two sons and dealing with the deterioration of her second marriage, a situation that led to a breakdown and a period of Jungian analysis. (Both her marriages had been to Virginians, first to Taylor Hardin in 1928 and then to the novelist Charles Wertenbaker in 1937, though her years with Hardin were spent in New York, where she worked for Vogue, Vanity Fair , and the Times —her few months on the Times in 1935 making her only the fourth woman in fifty years to be hired as a city-room reporter there.) She and Bowers had more in common than their New England background and the brevity of their residence in Charlottesville: both had experienced marital difficulties recently, and both were passionately dedicated to their writing. They were married on 16 March 1942 (by Bowers's landlord, a minister), and the marriage proved to be a perfect, and lifetime, match. They respected one another's work, and their relationship provided the kind of mutual support that enabled them both to be productive. The year 1942 was eventful for both of them, and not only because of their marriage. Her ambitious novel so long in process, The Prodigal Women , was published to great acclaim and became a best-seller; and he entered into military duty. Before Pearl Harbor, Bowers had been given secret instruction as a cryptanalyst in a naval communications intelligence group being formed at the university, and he was now asked to supervise an intelligence unit working on deciphering enemy codes. As a Lieutenant (junior grade) in the United States Naval Reserve, he moved to Washington (a hundred twenty miles away)—to 3727 McKinley Street, N.W.—with his new family that included Nancy Hale's two sons, Mark Hardin (born 1930) and William Wertenbaker (born 1938). (During their Washington years she wrote promotional pieces for the Treasury Department.) Bowers threw himself into the work with characteristic enthusiasm and energy, and he was eventually promoted to Lieutenant Commander. One story of his wartime activity has been well recounted by E. D. Hirsch (in his memorial resolution for Bowers at the University of Virginia faculty meeting on 23 April 1991): Bowers was in charge of a Naval Communications group that successfully devoted itself to cracking Japanese ciphers. He worked at that task with a tenacity and electromotive force that kept him going at flank speed long beyond the appointed eight-hour day. On one occasion when his colleagues had reached the point of exhaustion, the group appointed a charming young WAVE to go ask Commander Bowers whether the team might not begin keeping normal Navy work hours so they could catch up on their sleep. Bowers looked up in genuine astonishment and said, "I don't understand you people. Don't you want to win the war?" A concern with sleep was understandable, since the work was scheduled on a twenty-four-hour watch system, in which the time of each individual's eight-hour shift changed every three days. For Bowers the excitement of the search made up for the disruptive effects of this plan; and after the war he would describe the exhilaration that came when the solution of a code with scrambled five-digit sets finally fell into place and he realized that he had learned the location of a Japanese warship. The group assembled in the Naval Communications Annex at Ward Circle was remarkable—a "dismayingly bright bunch," in the words of William H. Bond (who said that in odd moments they would engage in such activities as "playing blindfold chess"). The unit included Archibald Hill and William Weedon from the University of Virginia (English and philosophy), Richmond Lattimore (the classicist from Bryn Mawr), Samuel Thorne (the legal historian, then at Northwestern), Walter Rideout (then a teaching assistant at Harvard), and Stephen Parrish (who had just graduated from the University of Illinois), among others. But from the point of view of bibliographical history, the most important fact is that the group also included Giles Dawson and Ray O. Hummel of the Folger Library staff, and William H. Bond and Charlton Hinman, who had been Folger Research Fellows together in 1941-42. Bond, later to head the Houghton Library, was then a student of Rollins's at Harvard; he had become interested in bibliographical analysis while at the Folger and had written a pioneering article on half-sheet imposition (published in the September-December 1941 number of The Library ). Hinman had been Bowers's first dissertation student (earning a Ph.D. in 1941) and had "with great originality pushed ahead" in developing techniques for analytical bibliography (to use Bowers's words at the 1941 English Institute). The method followed in the intelligence unit for comparing successive photographs of enemy fortifications, to see whether changes had been made, gave Hinman the idea for a machine to facilitate collating the texts of copies of books from the same typesetting—a machine put together, as Bond described it, "from bits taken from Giles Dawson's son's Erector set, two slide projectors, and sundry electric motors, mirrors, etc." After the war, he developed into a more sophisticated form what came to be known as the Hinman Collator and used it to compare copies of the Shakespeare First Folio at the Folger Library. It seems appropriate that several of the scholars interested in analytical bibliography after the war, including the two leaders of the field (Bowers and Hinman), spent their wartime years performing cryptanalytic work together, for the goal of both activities is to find meaningful patterns in what at first seem to be chaotic data, and the bent of mind required for both is obviously similar. (Indeed, in a letter of 22 October 1985, Bowers referred to "breaking the code of the two different systems of compositor marking" in two of Hawthorne's books.) Bowers's wartime training doubtless gave stimulus to his postwar bibliographical research, and it certainly showed him the excitement that can reward the indefatigable analysis of details. When the war was over, in 1945, to returned to Charlottesville and began the steady building of what was to become one of the most distinguished and influential careers in the history of American scholarship.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Bowers was forty at the end of the war, and was almost at the midpoint of his life. The four preceding decades had been preparatory, on both a personal and a professional level, for the extraordinary fulfillment—on both levels—that came to him in the following four decades. Once back from Washington, he wasted no time in making a new beginning, pushing ahead in the bibliographical studies that had captured his attention before the war; and in 1948 and 1949 he was responsible for two publications that permanently altered the course of bibliography. The first was a volume of bibliographical essays and notes, edited by him, called Papers of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia . The Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia had been formed in February 1947, with the collector Chalmers L. Gemmill as president, Bowers as vice-president, and the University's rare-book librarian, John Cook Wyllie, as secretary-treasurer, in order "to foster [in the words of its constitution] an interest in books (including books in manuscript), maps, printing, and bibliography." Bowers had himself read the first paper before the Society at its inaugural meeting on 26 February 1947, a paper entitled "Some Problems and Practices in Bibliographical Descriptions of Modern Authors"; in it he stressed the need for a more scholarly approach in this area and praised the work of Michael Sadleir, Percy Muir, and Jacob Blanck. By late 1948 a dozen papers had been read by speakers from Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Washington, as well as from Charlottesville (and many of the papers had been published in mimeographed form). Among the speakers were Charlton Hinman (on why the Folger Shakespeare Library has so many copies of the Shakespeare First Folio), Harold Tribolet (the Chicago bookbinder), C. William Miller (later the bibliographer of Benjamin Franklin), and Giles Dawson and James G. McManaway of the Folger. The Society had also published eight numbers of a newsletter (called Secretary's News Sheet ), and in the seventh (dated June 1948) this announcement appeared: The publication of the first of our formal Papers , under the editorship of Dr. Fredson Bowers, may now be definitely announced. Preliminary plans for these were laid in the first days of Mr. Massey's presidency of the Society [the collector Linton R. Massey had been elected the second president on 19 December 1947] and were approved by the Council. The printing has been tentatively financed by a generous anonymous donation of $100.00, by the allocation of $300.00 [actually $700] in dues, by a grant (still not formally notified) of $300.00 from a foundation [actually $750 from the Richmond Area University Center], and by the expectation of some sales and advertisements. The plan is to sell the Papers at $2.50 a copy; they come free, of course, to members. . . . Anticipated publication date: September. At about the same time a flyer was widely distributed, advertising the new publication: a two-leaf fold of Strathmore Pastelle, it showed the title page on its first page and a sample page of text on its third (a handsome layout in Goudy's Monotype Garamont), with a listing of the contents on its second page and an order blank on its fourth. The volume that appeared at the end of the year (two hundred pages, printed in December at the William Byrd Press, Richmond, and bound in heavy white paper) contained eleven articles and six "notes" and set the pattern for the volumes that were to follow. The pieces ranged widely (from the Middle Ages to the nineteenth century) and were contributed both by established scholars (such as Curt F. Bühler, the incunabulist of the Pierpont Morgan Library) and by young assistant professors (like C. William Miller and Allan H. Stevenson) and even graduate students, including several from Virginia (such as James S. Steck, George Walton Williams, and Philip Williams). Bowers was clearly not concerned with the stature of the contributors, as long as their articles met his standards, and through this group of articles he was making the statement that he was particularly interested in work that explored new areas of analytical bibliography. The volume contained the first of Allan Stevenson's brilliant expositions of the uses of paper as bibliographical evidence (two years Bowers's senior, Stevenson had published four previous articles, all on James Shirley); Curt Bühler's piece was an experiment in applying Bowers's and Hinman's recent work on headlines to incunabula; and there were three forward-looking analytical studies dealing with the Renaissance—Philip Williams's examination of spelling to identify compositors, James Steck's statement of the usefulness of center rules as bibliographical evidence, and Bowers's own explanation of the role of headline evidence in determining half-sheet imposition. The volume was enthusiastically reviewed (in Modern Language Quarterly , 1951) by R. C. Bald, who accurately assessed the significance of its publication: The appearance of this handsomely printed annual is an event of some importance, for which the credit is largely due to the energy and enterprise of the editor. He, more than anyone else, is responsible for the fact that not only has the University of Virginia a bibliographical society (and what other American university has one?), but that a group of colleagues and students have become sufficiently interested in the history and practice of printing to make discoveries and record their findings. Advances in knowledge come most readily under the stimulus of a congenial atmosphere where colleagues are attracted by allied problems, and where hypotheses can be subjected to the criticism of sympathetic co-workers. Of course, not all of these papers have come out of Charlottesville, but enough of them have done so to stamp on the collection the imprint of a group. He added—also correctly as it turned out—that the volume "is almost certainly the forerunner of a distinguished series." Although The Library had already shown its hospitality to the kind of analytical article that characterized Bowers's publication, there was no doubt that Bowers was staking out this area as a particular concern, and succeeding volumes confirmed the fact. The second one, bearing the now familiar title Studies in Bibliography (the original title remaining as a subtitle), contained as its lead article an investigation by William B. Todd of the early editions and issues of Matthew Lewis's The Monk . This article (deriving from a talk before the Society on 17 December 1948, while he was writing a pioneering University of Chicago dissertation) was Todd's first publication, the first of his many new applications of analytical bibliography to eighteenth-century English books. The volume also included another analytical piece by Philip Williams (who had just received his Ph.D. under Bowers's supervision) and an essay by Bowers himself on the use of type-page width as a reflection of the compositor's stick and therefore as an initial test for identifying the stints of different compositors. The Times Literary Supplement (London) declared (on 14 July 1950) that, with this volume, the Society "firmly establishes its sponsorship of a journal which should be on the shelves of every great reference library." It was the next volume, however, that really made Studies (or " SB ," as it was also called) a force in the scholarly world. The third volume, dated 1950 and labeled as for "1950-1951" (and consisting of over three hundred pages), presented a dozen major articles by a roster of contributors that in retrospect appears an honor roll: R. C. Bald (then at Cornell), W. W. Greg (just knighted the previous June), Archibald A. Hill (who had been at Virginia during Bowers's early years there), Curt F. Bühler, Ernst Kyriss (the great German scholar of bookbindings), Philip Williams, Charlton Hinman, C. William Miller, William B. Todd, Rollo G. Silver (who was to become the most distinguished historian of American printing), J. Albert Robbins, and Bowers himself (with an important essay on "Some Relations of Bibliography to Editorial Problems"). Bowers's energetic and astute solicitation of articles, demonstrated so often in the ensuing years, was illustrated here by the presence of four significant papers from the English Institute of 1949—those of Bald, Greg, and Hill, as well as his own. Contemporary readers could not have known that Greg's essay, "The Rationale of Copy-Text," would become one of the most seminal papers in the history of English scholarship, the point of departure, and also sometimes of contention, for textual critics throughout the next half-century. But surely those early readers shared with the anonymous reviewer in the Times Literary Supplement for 23 March 1951 (in fact, John Carter) the view that this volume "must take its place in the first rank of such publications anywhere in the world." With the fourth volume (1951), appearing in hard cover (paper-covered boards) with paper labels on the spine and front cover, Studies assumed the elegant look that was to continue through 1966 (when stamping replaced the labels). With more work by Stevenson, Todd, Bühler, and Bowers himself, and with articles by G. I. Duthie, James G. McManaway, and Giles E. Dawson, this volume continued to feature bibliographical analysis and textual criticism, especially as applied to Renaissance books; and the reputation of Studies in this area was reinforced by the repeated appearances, over the next fifteen years, of John Russell Brown, I. B. Cauthen, Jr., Charlton Hinman, Cyrus Hoy, Harold Jenkins, Robert K. Turner, Jr., Alice Walker, and George Walton Williams, among others—though there were also distinguished contributions in other fields. The sense one had in examining these early volumes was effectively caught by Philip Edwards in his review of the fifth volume: "Professor Fredson Bowers has created a new aristocracy in the world of bibliography, and the works he has here collected (so often revealing his own inspiration) have that kind of energy and sense of discovery which moved the Bibliographical Society in the days of Pollard, Greg, and McKerrow" ( Shakespeare Quarterly , 1953). Allusion to illustrious English precedents was again present when Studies reached its twentieth volume (dated 1967). Frank Francis, director of the British Museum and immediate past president of the Bibliographical Society in London, contributed a foreword that recognized the inspiration drawn by Bowers from the work of the English society. The Virginia organization, he said, had been formed by "a group of dedicated individuals banded together"—wording reminiscent of his phrase "a sense of common adventure," which he had used (in the London society's 1945 jubilee volume) to describe the early days of the older society. But "in this case," Francis added, a journal "sprang into being full-grown and fully armed, like Minerva from the head of Jupiter, whose thunderbolts she wielded from time to time." The identity of Jupiter was obvious: "the Society with the prestige it now enjoys and the great success it has had is substantially the image of its Editor, whose industry and monumental achievements in analytical bibliography are the admiration of bibliographers." Another foreword by Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., president of the University of Virginia, showed that the renown of Studies was celebrated at home as well as abroad. And the fame of Studies prompted a full-page anniversary notice in the Times Literary Supplement headed "Bibliography and Dr. Bowers" (27 April 1967), recalling the time when the first volume "came forth to astonish all the bibliographers of Europe." The centrality of Studies , evident from its continued publication of pioneering work, was further suggested by the inclusion, beginning with the third volume, of a series of annual checklists of bibliographical scholarship; and, in turn, those lists—with major sections entitled "Printing, Publishing, Bibliographical and Textual Scholarship"—helped to promote one of Bowers's goals for the journal by taking for granted the integral relationship among conventional studies of printing and publishing history, the newer and rapidly developing approaches of analytical bibliography, and investigations of textual problems. (Bowers discontinued these checklists with the one covering 1972 because of the duplication that would theoretically have resulted from the expansion of the Dutch publication ABHB: The Annual Bibliography of the History of the Printed Book and Libraries to include American scholarship as of 1973; but ironically much of the analytical and textual work of the kind that had been listed in Studies was not regarded by the editors of ABHB as within its scope—an indication that Bowers's view of bibliography as a field was not yet widely understood.) One glimpse behind the scenes in the early years of Studies is afforded by Bowers's reply to the Times Literary Supplement's review of the fourth volume (on 7 March 1952): the reviewer lamented the paucity of contributions dealing with the post-1800 period in all bibliographical journals, and Bowers replied (on 9 May 1952) that he was conscious of this "imbalance," that the five articles and ten notes on this period thus far published in Studies "represent the total number submitted to us," and that he had not been able to secure more "by personal solicitation." The solicitation of material for Studies was one of Bowers's dominant preoccupations for the rest of his life: he never missed an opportunity to ask the authors of papers he heard and admired at conferences if they would let Studies print their work, and when he met or learned of scholars whose research sounded promising, he not only encouraged them to think of Studies but also often gave them detailed suggestions. His continuous solicitation of articles is amusingly epitomized by a note in his 1975 volume of collected essays: in a new footnote appended to a sentence (written in 1941) on the possibility of using headlines to detect page-by-page (rather than forme-by-forme) printing, he wrote, "For reasons that escape me, I never have pursued this promising lead. Perhaps some interested bibliographer will have a look at the problem (and let me publish his results in SB . . .)" (p. 207). Even in his collected essays, he could not resist the urge to stir up contributions. For good reason, Studies was close to his heart, and he knew that the maintenance of a first-rate journal requires the editor's unceasing attention. As one thinks about the progress of his life, and the many projects that he was involved in at any given time, one should remember that a constant in the background, from 1948 on, was all the activity connected with the annual production of Studies . The other major bibliographical event of the late 1940s, besides the inauguration of Studies in Bibliography , was the publication by Princeton University Press in 1949 of Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description , one of the great books in the history of bibliography (indeed, of scholarship generally). Many years later he wrote (in a letter on 22 October 1985) that "the Principles was, or now seems, almost an accident." The reason was that it emerged as a by-product of his major research endeavor at this time (one that he continued to work on, whenever time allowed, for the rest of his life)—a descriptive bibliography of the English printed drama from 1660 to 1700. The first volume of W. W. Greg's magisterial A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration had been published in 1939; whether Bowers before the war conceived the idea of extending Greg's work through 1700 is not clear, but after the war (at least by early 1946) he began research for the project. He identified himself in the first volume of Studies in Bibliography as "writing a descriptive bibliography of the post-Restoration English Drama 1660-1700" (one should note that at this early date he was speaking of "writing" a bibliography, for he continued to emphasize that the kind of bibliography he was concerned with was a genre of writing, not something that one "compiles"—as he specifically pointed out in a footnote to his 1948 article in the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America [ PBSA ]). His pieces in the first two volumes of Studies (1948-49) drew their examples from Restoration drama, and in a footnote in the second volume he acknowledged grants for this undertaking from the Research Council of the Richmond Area University Center and the Research Committee of the University of Virginia. One of the first results of his work on Restoration drama was A Supplement to the Woodward and McManaway Check List of English Plays 1641-1700 , which he published as a 22-page pamphlet through the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia in 1949. If he was to write a descriptive bibliography, he had to decide on the principles and procedures to be followed; as he said in 1985, "The state of affairs was a mess, and from starting the play examinations and recording, I began to see that I could learn enough, with some special reading, to begin to put some order into a mushy situation." The required reading at that time, besides R. B. McKerrow's Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927), was Greg's "A Formulary of Collation" in The Library for March 1934, slightly supplemented by his "Provisional Memoranda" in the 1939 volume of his Bibliography . The first published results of Bowers's thought about the situation were published in PBSA in 1947 and 1948: the first essay (in the Fourth Quarter 1947 number), "Criteria for Classifying Hand-Printed Books as Issues and Variant States," attempted to clarify McKerrow's discussion by emphasizing the importance of cancel title-leaves as determinants of "issue"; in the second (Third Quarter 1948), called "Certain Basic Problems in Descriptive Bibliography" (read before a meeting of the Bibliographical Society of America on 5 June 1948 in Philadelphia), he talked about the necessity for examining multiple copies of every edition to be described and suggested the standards and procedures that he believed were entailed in such examination (as they had evolved in his own research for the Restoration bibliography). The depth of Bowers's feeling about the kind of work he was embarked on is suggested by the final words of this second article: in spite of the drudgery—and for sheer drudgery there is nothing like much of the routine of bibliographical work—no bibliographer would give up the thrill of chasing the elusive variant always to be found, of course, just in the next copy, or the satisfaction, at the end, of a solid piece of work accomplished, which, God willing, will stand up under the test of time and will never need to be done again. It was the previous article, however, that aroused more comment. In the Times Literary Supplement for 4 September 1948, John Carter discussed it with his characteristic sympathy for any advance in bibliographical rigor, but he also shrewdly noted that "Professor Bowers will seem to withdraw too far into bibliographical purism for some readers." One such reader was Paul Dunkin, senior cataloguer at the Folger Shakespeare Library, who responded with an article entitled "The State of the Issue" ( PBSA , Third Quarter 1948), largely a defense of the more pragmatic approach of library cataloguers and a plea that the practice of bibliographers should not drift away from that of cataloguers through the adoption of "intricate philosophical distinctions." (Dunkin was to be a persistent critic of Bowers over the next two decades.) Bowers's reply, a three-page letter in the next number of PBSA , is notable, first, for its statement of a principle that he generally adhered to: "one has one's original say in print and should not feel that a formal reply is necessary for every disagreement with one's views which thereupon develops." But he did wish to use the occasion to emphasize the difference between a catalogue and a bibliography, and the letter is a good early example of his firmness in controversy: "I cannot as a bibliographer," he said, "accept the complacent notion that issue is something everybody knows but nobody can define. . . . I feel myself obliged to disagree with any professional cataloguer who argues that descriptive bibliography must conform to cataloguing standards. . . . such standards are wholly inadequate for the purposes of rigorous bibliographical research." There can be no doubt that Bowers's argument was far more logical than Dunkin's, but this kind of blunt statement was not calculated to promote mutual understanding. That the practice of bibliographical description was a topic much in the air is further suggested by the fact that the Rosenbach Lectures at the University of Pennsylvania in the spring of 1947 took up the subject, with Curt F. Bühler speaking on incunabula, James G. McManaway on early English literature, and Lawrence C. Wroth on early Americana. Although the published volume of these lectures (entitled Standards of Bibliographical Description ) did not appear until about the same time in 1949 as Bowers's Principles , there was some interchange of ideas among the four scholars. Bowers noted in his foreword that he had been given typescripts of the three lectures; McManaway, in turn, read parts of the Principles in typescript, and Bühler acknowledged in print his "deep gratitude" to Bowers, whose "kindness in making his notes readily available" was "an example of scholarly coöperation all too rarely encountered" (p. 45). Bowers and Bühler did not agree on the description of incunables, however. Bühler thought that the Greg-Bowers style of signature collation was not suitable for incunabula; as a result, he said, "the most recent exposition of the Gregian bibliographical shorthand, which it was my privilege to read in manuscript, has left me very dissatisfied" (p. 26). Bowers's third appendix to the Principles specifically set out to respond to Bühler's objections and to show how the formulary could be applied to fifteenth-century books. Bowers was also in touch with Greg at this time. Greg's full statement of the method he employed in his Bibliography had been drafted in 1942, even though it was not published until 1959 (in the fourth volume of his Bibliography ), and he was therefore able to read Bowers's typescript in the light of what he had already written. He chose not to insert references to the Principles in his final version, however, and simply noted that "Professor Bowers and I do not always see eye to eye" (p. iv). If his brief public acknowledgment of "helpful criticism and correction" from Bowers was not particularly magnanimous, he was nevertheless privately generous to Bowers in making detailed suggestions; and Bowers handsomely recorded his gratitude in his foreword: I may . . . acknowledge my paramount indebtedness to Dr. W. W. Greg's searching criticisms of a large part of the manuscript, accompanied by a correspondence in which, although in the midst of his own pressing work, he most patiently supplemented his views in order to save me from a number of fallacies. To be able thus to draw on the experience of the greatest bibliographer of our times was a privilege I could ill have foregone in the preparation of any study such as this. Bowers had clearly by this time come to regard Greg as a model, and he dedicated the book to Greg. The Principles , as it finally emerged out of these discussions at the end of 1949 (officially published on 30 December), was a 500-page book that concentrated for its first three hundred pages on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century books and then, after relatively short sections on the application of the same procedures to fifteenth- and eighteenth-century books, devoted about a hundred pages to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In the major sections, a thorough discussion of classification (into editions, impressions, issues, and states) was followed by recommendations for title-page transcription, signature collation, statements of pagination and contents, and descriptions of typography, illustrations, and (for the later books) paper and publishers' bindings. The book was by far the most detailed treatment the subject had ever received, serving in matters of rationale as well as of procedure to draw together the developments of the previous hundred years and to provide a coherent framework within which to proceed. Any careful reader of this book must be struck by the rigorously logical and powerfully synthesizing mind that it reveals. It takes for granted that descriptive bibliography is a branch of historical scholarship, and it works through in great detail the various situations that bibliographers may have to deal with, illustrating in the process the relevance of artifactual evidence to intellectual history. In the foreword, Bowers stated one of the aims of descriptive bibliography as providing "an analytical investigation and an ordered arrangement of these physical facts which would serve as the prerequisite for textual criticism"; and in the first section, he explained the relation of physical details to textual and literary criticism, pointing out that the "investigation of the text of a book as it passed through the printer's hands may produce facts of considerable critical importance, particularly as the evidence may turn on the relation of the printed text to the manuscript copy" (p. 15). The interrelations of descriptive bibliography with analytical bibliography and textual criticism underlie everything that is said (and are implied by the statement on the dust jacket that the book "is intended to supplement and act as a companion piece to McKerrow's well-known Introduction to Bibliography "). The book fully deserves to be called magisterial, but its author took a more limited satisfaction in it than one might imagine. "It was done," he said (in that 22 October 1985 letter), "under intense time-pressure from Princeton and could have been better if I had not been so pushed. At the time I was reasonably satisfied with most of it as the best I could do at that moment. It is only of late that I have been truly surprised that it turned out to be something of a seminal work." There is no question about its stature: despite a few deficiencies, which Bowers knew were present and which have become more evident in hindsight, it is the basic book in its field, and it is not likely ever to be supplanted. It may have been a by-product of his work on Restoration drama, but it was the book that made him famous in the scholarly world, and deservedly so. One might expect such a work to have been eagerly welcomed, as it indeed was by some reviewers, but others were repelled by its quantity of technical detail and its unrelenting emphasis on extensive investigation. The reviewer for the Times Literary Supplement (29 September 1950) said concisely what many people apparently believed—that Bowers "seems inclined at times to make a comparatively easy matter difficult by over-elaboration." Herbert J. Davis, not an unsympathetic reader by any means, raised a similar point much more thoughtfully (in Year's Work in English Studies for 1949): Bowers, he said, "bravely" attempted to answer all questions, but the "danger of such elaboration is that it may so widen the division between the bibliographer and the student of literature that it will be impossible even for the textual critic to use without difficulty some of the technical devices now employed in the analysis of the physical make-up of a book." On his third page, Bowers acknowledged, "I am conscious of attempting to set a standard for descriptive bibliography which is not customarily thought to be necessary and hence has been seldom observed." The system he set forth was actually not very complex, not nearly as formidable as people often seemed to think; but the sheer size of his book, the result of his thoroughness, unfortunately encouraged the perception of descriptive bibliography as an arcane specialty. When Bowers wrote, descriptive bibliography was at least taken seriously for books from the first few centuries of printing, and the Principles was the culmination of the English tradition of studying book structure, a tradition that stemmed from Henry Bradshaw, librarian of Cambridge University from 1867 to 1886. But another English tradition had grown up in the late nineteenth century, as collectors began to consider the literature of their own century worth collecting: the production of "author bibliographies" that were actually simple listings intended to enable collectors to identify the "first editions" of the authors they wished to pursue. Although by 1949 several of the bibliographies of nineteenth- and twentieth-century authors were somewhat more elaborate, there was still a prevalent feeling that the detail required for older books was not necessary for machine-printed books: there was still a split between the scholarly description of the structure of the artifacts called books and the identification of "modern first editions" for collectors. Bowers addressed this problem in the introductory chapter to his discussion of nineteenth- and twentieth-century books: in no uncertain terms, he pointed out that for books of these centuries "little has been done of a quality which can bear comparison with work devoted to books printed on the hand press" (p. 356). "Bibliographical study," he said, "is essentially a continuous operation, and truly scholarly investigation of modern books can be engaged in only by those writers who are conversant with the methods of research developed for earlier books" (p. 365). He went on to say, "The requirements of collectors cannot be neglected, but these are fully met as by-products of the work and should not be its sole reason for existence" (p. 366). A few earlier bibliographers, notably Michael Sadleir, had understood this point, but in general the treatment of modern books was dominated by a tradition that did not recognize the relations between collecting and scholarship. It is not surprising, therefore, that Bowers's approach and style provoked a considerable amount of resistance. John Carter, generally sympathetic with Bowers's aims, put the matter astutely in his 1951 Windsor Lecture at the University of Illinois (printed in Nineteenth-Century English Books , 1952): "here is a powerful—indeed an autocratic—intelligence, addicted to formula and impatient of imprecision, at large in an area whose bibliography is still in a highly fluid, and therefore vulnerable, state" (p. 80). (Eighteen years later, when presenting Bowers with the Bibliographical Society's Gold Medal, Carter called him "the first man to adapt McKerrovian principles to those bibliographically complex centuries which McKerrow himself never tackled.") The most famous episode illustrating this situation is Geoffrey Keynes's delivery of his Presidential Address before the Bibliographical Society in London on 17 March 1953 (printed in The Library the same year). At that time Keynes had published the first eight of his well-known bibliographies, but he did not greet the Principles as a helpful guide; rather, he announced that the book was responsible for "the shadow which seems in recent years to have descended over our amiable bibliographical discipline as we have conceived it to be." The publication of the Principles (a "remarkable and, indeed, splendid book") was, he said, "an event of shattering importance to the little world of bibliography, because it brought home to our consciousness the fact that what we had thought in our innocence was a pleasant, if sometimes exacting, pastime, was in fact a prime example of 'pure scholarship', to be pursued with the mind of a detective, the spiritual temperature of an iceberg, and the precision of a machine." Nothing could have revealed more dramatically the state of descriptive bibliography than for the president of the society that had been responsible for establishing bibliography as a scholarly field to complain about the Principles for being too scholarly. In his autobiography, The Gates of Memory (1981), Keynes described the event: From the time I was an undergraduate at Cambridge I had been studying in depth the works of authors who interested me by making collections of their books, each of which in turn formed the basis of a "bio-bibliography" of the kind that I enjoyed compiling. These followed a different pattern from that used by professional bibliographers, and when in 1952-4 I was President of the Bibliographical Society of London I felt that an amateur presiding over gatherings of professionals should offer some sort of apologia or justification for a partial rejection of the rules by which leading practitioners of bibliography worked. Under the leadership of Professor Fredson Bowers of the University of Virginia, bibliographers were insisting on a form of notation which was incomprehensible to most of the people who would use my books—book collectors, booksellers, and even many librarians. I preferred to give readers less pedantry and more humanity, so that they gained knowledge about the authors of the books as well as a perhaps old-fashioned, but easily understood, analysis of the constitution of their books. I chose to call my Presidential Address to the Society . . . " Religio Bibliographici " (The Religion of a Bibliographer), in imitation of Sir Thomas Browne's Religio Medici (The Religion of a Doctor); it contained what was intended to be a friendly attack on the Bowers school of analytical bibliographers who considered the work which had given me so much enjoyment "impure bibliography" and therefore inadequate. It chanced that Professor Bowers was present at the occasion. I was glad that he accepted the address in the spirit in which it was meant, complaining only that he had not thought of the title himself. (pp. 308-309) What Keynes did not say is that the discussion period had begun with the silence of embarrassment and that Bowers (who was sitting between John Crow and William B. Todd) spoke only after Crow had whispered to him that everyone was waiting for him to break the silence. Bowers's own version of this episode (in a letter to his former student Matthew J. Bruccoli on 7 February 1970) was that John Hayward gave Keynes "an almost embarrassing going over at his Presidential Address . . ., at which I was present smiling like a Cheshire cat, but keeping my mouth shut except to compliment Keynes on the felicity of his title." (Bowers, who was in England the entire year of 1952-53 on a Fulbright Fellowship, had actually presented his views from the same platform four months earlier, on 18 November 1952, when he addressed the Society on "Purposes of Descriptive Bibliography, with Some Remarks on Methods," elaborating the implications of his thesis that "bibliography is properly an advanced form of independent scholarship.") The graciousness of Bowers's remark following Keynes's address was typical of his courtesy in social situations; but he expressed his real opinion on other occasions, as when, nearly six years later, he called the attitude represented by that address "the very reverse of scholarly" (in his Kansas lecture "The Bibliographical Way"). Keynes's odd belief that an emphasis on rigor and precision was somehow anti-humanistic and his fear that bibliography was tending to become an end in itself are two concerns that, illogical as they are, Bowers's book has continued to provoke, for the reluctance to see descriptive bibliography as a branch of historical study has been curiously persistent. Thus the Principles , though now an established classic to which many people turn with some knowledge of what they will find there, still has the power to startle other people, revealing to the open-minded the relevance for cultural history of examining books as artifacts. Within a year of its publication, according to Lewis Leary (in his review in South Atlantic Quarterly in 1951), the book was "an inspired revelation for a crusading band of young converts," and this process continues. Leary presciently stated that the book was "one of the most important and, implicitly, one of the most provocative volumes produced by literary scholarship within our generation." During the writing of the Principles , Bowers was working on a descriptive bibliography of George Sandys, the seventeenth-century English verse-translator and travel-writer who was an official of the Virginia colony in the early 1620s. He had been drawn to Sandys by Richard Beale Davis, who was preparing to write a biography of Sandys (Davis had received a doctorate from Virginia before Bowers's arrival but had taught there in the summers from 1938 through 1942). Bibliographical details from Sandys's books are cited as illustrations about a dozen times in the Principles , and full descriptions of two editions of Sandys's translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses are included among the sample descriptions at the end of the book. The complete Sandys bibliography appeared in print, as a collaboration between Bowers and Davis (although Bowers wrote the descriptions), just a few months after the Principles , first in the April, May, and June 1950 numbers of the Bulletin of the New York Public Library and then as a separate pamphlet of fifty-four pages. Bowers thus put his ideas about descriptive bibliography into practice in a full-scale bibliography almost simultaneously with the Principles ; but this fact has often gone unnoted because of the modesty of the title, George Sandys: A Bibliographical Catalogue of Printed Editions in England to 1700 . In the introduction Bowers explained that "bibliographical catalogue" was chosen for the title rather than "descriptive bibliography" ("which the fullness of the descriptions would ordinarily warrant") because "certain editions were available in too few copies for anything approaching a definitive examination which would reveal all possible variants" and because "a control copy of each edition was not used for direct page for page comparison of the typesetting in each copy examined." Bowers was obviously obliged to follow the stringent standards set forth in the Principles , where he recommended the term "bibliographical catalogue" for "elaborately conceived and executed descriptions . . . when the high requirements of bibliographies have not been completely met either in the number of copies compared or in the method of examination" (p. 5). In the Sandys he said, "It is our hope that the descriptions in this present work are actually definitive, but we cannot speak with the absolute authority which would justify the title of a descriptive bibliography." Stressing this point was a natural element in Bowers's campaign to elevate the status of bibliographical research; but the resulting title has, I think, caused many people seeking a model of bibliographical description not to look into the work. What we actually have in it is Bowers's explicit use of "the full system" set forth in the Principles . As Herbert Davis said in the Year's Work in English Studies (1950), the Sandys exemplified the "fullest requirements of a modern bibliography." It is not only a companion-piece to the Principles but the most extensive work in the genre of bibliographical description that Bowers published in his lifetime (though he did include descriptions in some of his critical editions). With the Principles off his hands, Bowers was able to concentrate in the early 1950s on two editorial projects—a long-standing one, on Thomas Dekker, and a new one, on Walt Whitman—that were important in their own right and significant in their anticipation of his later work. During 1949, before the Principles was published, he had become convinced of the value of a new approach to Elizabethan editing set forth in an essay Greg was writing on "The Rationale of Copy-Text." Bowers had solicited the paper for the English Institute conference to be held in September; and, as revised on the basis of Bowers's suggestions, it was read for Greg on that occasion by J. M. Osborn. Besides securing this paper for Studies in Bibliography , Bowers wrote a commentary on it, expanding and clarifying certain points and showing the relevance of the approach to Restoration literature as well. (This piece, "Current Theories of Copy-Text, with an Illustration from Dryden," in fact came out in Modern Philology for August 1950, before Greg's essay had appeared.) From then on, Bowers was the champion of Greg's approach, publicizing it in his lectures and using it as the basis for his own editorial practice. The essence of Greg's position was that, when there are two or more potentially authoritative editions of a work, the authority for variants in wording ("substantive variants") may well lie in a later edition (if it incorporated revisions by the author), whereas the authority for variants in punctuation and spelling ("accidentals") may well lie in the earliest edition (which is the closest one to the author's manuscript and thus may preserve more of these features of it than any later edition does). Greg was therefore encouraging editors to use their judgment (informed by bibliographical analysis as well as literary sensitivity) in combining features from different documents to produce texts that could be defended as closer to what the authors intended than were the texts of any of the surviving documents. In emphasizing the exercise of editorial judgment, Greg was coming round to an attitude that had been elegantly advocated for classical literature by A. E. Housman half a century earlier. Editors of the modern languages had been more insistent on limiting the role of judgment, though by 1939 McKerrow, in his Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare , had taken a tentative step in the direction that Greg finally moved with decisiveness. (In a rare excursion into bibliographical history, Bowers published in Shakespeare Quarterly in 1955 an essay on "McKerrow's Editorial Principles for Shakespeare Reconsidered," in which he placed McKerrow's position in its historical context and showed how McKerrow was moving to the position that Greg enunciated.) The time was ripe for this kind of move, and conceivably Bowers would have made it without Greg's lead; there is no question, however, that Greg's paper came at the right moment to help Bowers formulate his own position, and there is little doubt that Bowers, in turn, caused Greg's ideas to spread faster than they would have without such energetic support. By June of 1952 Bowers had completed his work on the first volume of The Dramatic Works of Thomas Dekker , and it was published in 1953 by Cambridge University Press. Its historic status as the first edition to employ Greg's "Rationale" is not proclaimed in the volume itself, and Bowers's quiet and succinct statement of his procedure (ten pages on "The Text of This Edition") does not suggest how momentous it was. For the two Dekker plays that have authoritative second editions, Bowers stated, "I use the methods of recent textual theorists" (citing in a footnote Greg's essay and McKerrow's Prolegomena , along with his own Modern Philology article): I retain the "accidentals"—the general texture of spelling, punctuation, and capitalization—of the first edition, the only one which has a direct relationship to the "accidentals" in the manuscript that served as printer's copy. Into this texture I introduce those revisions (chiefly "substantive") for which, in my opinion, neither the compositor nor the printing-house editor but the author was responsible. For these two plays the critical text thus comes as nearly as possible to reproducing the copy of the first edition marked by the author for the printer of the second edition. (p. ix) In line with this policy, he indicated that he would follow his judgment, and no mechanical rule, in the choice between variants from so-called corrected and uncorrected states of sheets, preferring the "uncorrected" states when the "corrected" variants appeared to be alterations made by a printing-house reader without recourse to the manuscript; and he would alter the accidentals of the first-edition copy-texts sparingly, allowing inconsistencies to remain. (This general statement of editorial rationale was supplemented by textual introductions to the individual plays, setting forth their textual and printing histories, with the help of bibliographical analysis of multiple copies of the original editions.) The other notable aspect of this edition, besides its use of Greg, was its presentation of the apparatus. Traditionally in scholarly editions a single record of variants and emendations had been placed at the foot of the page, with discursive notes sometimes appended to that listing and sometimes placed at the end. Bowers's thinking about the implications of Greg's rationale and about the convenience of the reader led him to alter this plan: at the foot of the page he noted only his substantive departures from the copy-text, moving the rest of the apparatus to the end of the text and arranging it in several sections (discursive notes, press-variants, alterations of copy-text accidentals, and a "historical collation" of substantive variants in pre-1700 editions—employing throughout two symbols, the wavy dash and the caret, that had been suggested by McKerrow to stand for a repeated word and the absence of punctuation). The importance of the copy-text, and its accidentals, in Greg's rationale is reflected in this arrangement by the segregation of the two listings of copy-text emendations from the record of other variants, thus making it easier for the reader to focus on the editor's judgments, and indeed to concentrate at will on either the substantives or the accidentals. As Arthur Brown later said of the Dekker, in surveying the research on Renaissance drama since 1900 ( Shakespeare Survey , 1961), "Bowers's methods differ in almost every important respect from those of previous editors. He is quite deliberately putting into practice the accumulated theory of fifty years of textual scholarship in this field." This innovative plan was followed in three more stately volumes, appearing in 1955, 1958, and 1961. In the 2100 pages of the Dekker edition, Bowers provided a model for the twentieth-century editing of Elizabethan drama, illustrating the application of the latest developments in analytical bibliography and editorial thinking. This achievement naturally brought him praise; but there was criticism, too, largely occasioned by his decision to confine his introductions and annotations strictly to textual matters. In the first volume, he announced, "The explanatory notes in these volumes are not intended as elucidations of the text but only as discussions of specific emendation, or of refusal to emend." Many readers may not have grasped the full import of this statement at first, accustomed as they were to find historical and literary annotation in editions. The absence of such notes led a number of people (including Greg in Review of English Studies in 1959) to describe the edition as "austere." Arthur Brown, reviewing the first volume for The Library (1954), said, "Austerity is perhaps the keynote of the work." Recognizing that "this is really the first time that a major Elizabethan dramatist other than Shakespeare or Jonson has been edited with present-day disciplines," Brown felt it "desirable to consider what interests are best served by these methods." He questioned whether bibliographically minded scholars would not wish to have more details than were provided, while general readers might prefer to exchange some of those details for historical commentary. Bowers replied in a lengthy letter published the following year, making clear that from the beginning Cambridge had planned to publish one or two volumes of critical introductions and commentary by another scholar. (Although he did not say so here, that other scholar was John Crow. Robert K. Turner, Jr., later conjectured that the Syndics of Cambridge University Press may have been reluctant to publish an edition by "a relatively unknown American" without a British scholar involved. In any case, the decision—whoever made it—to include only textual commentary in the text volumes set a pattern for Bowers's later editions. Four volumes of commentary for the Dekker were eventually published in 1980 by Bowers's former student Cyrus Hoy.) Bowers also took the occasion to restate the functions of a critical edition (which, as he pointed out, do not include serving as a substitute for original editions or facsimiles), and in the process he showed his skill in debate: That there is anything arcane, difficult, or unnecessary for everyday scholarly use about this apparatus is a concept I cannot find it in my heart to understand. And I understand it still less if the inference is to be drawn that so long as a presumably reputable scholar has edited a work, the rest of the world should be happy to take his results on trust without this presentation of his evidence. Seven years later, after publication of the fourth volume, Brown praised the whole edition for having set "a new and very high standard for future work of this kind"—but added, "however much an editor may dislike the principles upon which Professor Bowers has worked" ( The Library , 1962). A bibliographer such as Allan Stevenson, on the other hand, naturally liked the approach and found that the "total effect" of Bowers's textual introductions was "a fuller view of printing-house practice" ( Shakespeare Quarterly , 1956). And John Crow (remarking that Bowers's "practical work is as good as his theoretical") felt that the textual statement could be "taken as model by all future editors of early plays" ( Year's Work in English Studies , 1953). In retrospect it is surprising that so little immediate attention was paid to the implications of Greg's rationale (which favored dramatists' private intentions over the texts of performances) and that the absence of explanatory commentary proved such a stumbling-block. But it is easy to see why the Times Literary Supplement (27 October 1961) called the edition "a major achievement." Bowers's other editorial project of the fifties began in early September 1951 when C. Waller Barrett, the great collector of American literature who lived in the country not far from Charlottesville, showed him "a thick leather case packed full with autograph manuscripts by Walt Whitman" (as Bowers put it in his second Sandars lecture). These papers (the largest surviving block of Whitman manuscripts) consisted of the final handwritten drafts of some eighty poems prepared for the third edition of Leaves of Grass in 1860, including a large proportion of the new poems to be added to that edition. Bowers admitted the "drudgery" involved in working through the physical evidence and transcribing the texts, but he found it "fascinating" because he was able—through an analysis of the paper and its treatment—to shed light on the dating of these poems. He called his analysis "chiefly 'bibliographical,' with only occasional notice of literary and critical matters outside of textual considerations"; the purpose of the volume, published by the University of Chicago Press in 1955 and dedicated to James Southall Wilson, was to offer "full texts," leaving to others the pursuit of "the critical possibilities which these manuscripts open up for the study of Whitman as a conscious artist" (although he explored a few of them himself two years later in his second Sandars lecture). After an extensive analytical and historical introduction (called "a masterpiece of its kind" by H. Lüdeke in English Studies , 1958), the edition consisted of parallel texts: the left-hand page of each opening presented a "diplomatic" (i.e., literal and unaltered) transcription of the final manuscript texts (with footnotes recording the manuscript revisions that preceded those texts), and the right-hand page printed the corresponding texts as they appeared in the 1860 edition of Leaves of Grass . Bowers's description of the manuscript revisions, consisting of straightforward statements that do not entail symbols, follow essentially the same pattern as those he had used in The Fary Knight and was to employ in the Hawthorne edition. He kept thinking about the problem of recording manuscript alterations throughout his career and later developed a different plan; but the Whitman volume represents the full working-out of his original approach and foreshadows—both in this respect and in its nineteenth-century American subject—his extensive editing of American authors in the last three decades of his life. It was as important in its way as the Dekker edition, for it brought a new level of editorial scholarship to the study of American authors—and at a time when there were stirrings of interest among scholars of American literature in the organizing of full-scale editions of major American authors. Gay Wilson Allen, whose biography of Whitman appeared the same year as Bowers's edition and with whom Bowers had a mutually beneficial correspondence, was correct to say (in Modern Language Quarterly , 1956) that Bowers's work "initiates a new stage of Whitman scholarship and is likely to have far-reaching consequences." By the early 1950s, with the Principles published and with Studies in Bibliography and the Dekker edition well launched, Bowers was recognized—in the words of John Carter's 1951 Windsor Lecture—as "the most energetic and wide-ranging of contemporary bibliographical theorists" (p. 79). He was accordingly invited, during that decade, to deliver the three most prestigious series of bibliographical lectures in the English-speaking world. First came the lectures presented under the A. S. W. Rosenbach Fellowship in Bibliography (founded 1930) at the University of Pennsylvania on 21 and 28 April and 5 May 1954, entitled "On Editing Shakespeare and the Elizabethan Dramatists." Then the two English series, the Sandars (founded 1894) and the Lyell (founded 1952) came in successive years at the end of the decade: he was Samuel Sandars Reader in Bibliography at Cambridge University in 1957-58 and delivered three lectures under the title "Textual and Literary Criticism" on 20-22 January 1958 (he was abroad for only two weeks, 18 January to 1 February 1958, between semesters); and in Trinity Term 1959 (he was in England from 5 March to 17 July) he delivered six lectures (on six consecutive Tuesdays: 28 April; 5, 12, 19, 26 May; 2 June) on "Bibliography and Textual Criticism" as the fourth James P. R. Lyell Reader in Bibliography at Oxford (following Neil Ker, W. W. Greg, and Stanley Morison). (One intriguing souvenir of that occasion was a piece of printing produced in Bowers's honor by Herbert Davis's bibliography class on 12-13 March 1959, using the Daniel press at the Bodleian; the text chosen was "The Apologie of William Iaggard," as published in Augustine Vincent's A Discoverie of Errours , 1622, and the class put together two copies of a volume showing various stages in the production of this piece, with a title page reading The Transmission of a Text: An Example Prepared by the Members of the Bibliography Class at the New Bodleian for Fredson Bowers, James P. R. Lyell Reader in Bibliography . This item of Bodleian printing was included in the 1969-70 traveling exhibition "The Bodleian Library and Its Friends" and was described as entry 106 in the published catalogue.) The texts of these three series of lectures resulted in three major books—the last books (other than editions and a students' guide to Hamlet ) that he was to publish until he collected his essays in 1975 and 1989. These books provided the theoretical underpinning for his editing, and once he had them in print, making their rationale available for others to use, he concentrated on applying the principles and procedures they set forth to specific editorial tasks. On Editing Shakespeare and the Elizabethan Dramatists (1955) began with a survey of "The Texts and Their Manuscripts," and the opening paragraph of this first lecture made clear Bowers's emphasis on a reasoned approach to editing. What he opposed was "thoughtless imitation" of method, which "marks the road to sterility"; instead, editors should understand the reasons underlying any prescribed principles and then develop a procedure from "the particular kind of problem" confronting them. Although he specifically dealt with the routes by which Elizabethan plays reached print, his clear insistence on the need for independent thinking (epitomized by his example of Greg, "the greatest textual critic of our time" [p. 32], being led into "logical difficulties" by conventional assumptions about the role of Shakespeare's foul papers) had applications for all editors. The second lecture, on "The Function of Textual Criticism and Bibliography," dealt with "the kinds of evidence that may be granered from the printing process" and "the problems when multiple documents are preserved for the same text" (p. 34). Textual criticism and bibliography must be joined together in editing, producing what "may be called the biblio-textual method": bibliography, which attacks textual problems "from the mechanical point of view," and nonbibliographical textual criticism, which "works with meanings and literary values," must operate as counter-checks. "Bibliography endeavors to take as much guesswork as possible out of textual criticism, and the literary method endeavors to inform bibliography with value judgments as a check on mechanical probability" (p. 35). The bulk of the lecture, following several pages of these general observations, offered supporting examples from Shakespeare; but the aim of the lecture, like the first one, seems as much to set forth a sound approach for all editorial tasks as to instruct Shakespearean editors in particular. In the final lecture, "The Method for a Critical Edition," Bowers sketched the recent history of attempts both to restrict and to liberate editorial judgment and took his stand beside Greg: I find it a source of some private amusement that the greatest textual bibliographer of our time, one who might have been expected by non-bibliographical scholars to have insisted on the maximum application of rule, should have thrown consternation into editorial ranks by so clearly insisting on the ultimate responsibility of the editor, an honor that editors as a rule would be happy to forfeit. The truth is that some editors—though not the great ones—may have become editors because they were not critics. Editing has conventionally seemed a reliable, safe and sane, and slightly dull occupation, one eminently suitable for a conservative scholar distrustful of his private critical judgment. I do not deny that editing enforces a rigorous discipline, especially as Greg defines it, but this discipline cuts both ways and is as much critical as mechanical. In truth, to contrast criticism and mechanical logic is an absurdity, for it is of the nature of modern editing as against that of the past, that critical judgment must expand from a logical basis in bibliographical and linguistic fact. (pp. 71-72) This passage not only expresses a principle in which Bowers deeply believed but also illustrates his promotional efforts on behalf of the status of editorial work. He went on to elaborate the ways in which his and Greg's emphasis on critical judgment was different from the unprincipled eclecticism of eighteenth-century editors. The demanding new requirements, he realistically observed, were time-consuming enough that "what may be called a definitive text of Shakespeare" (p. 100) was not likely to appear in his lifetime; but he was confident that the piling up of bibliographical facts and the incorporating of them into critical evaluation would bring the editor "as close as mortal man can come to the original truth" (p. 101). These lectures, though early in his editorial career, foreshadowed the essence of his mature position, and they contained his characteristic mixture of scholarly rigor and promotional enthusiasm. There had been no previous general book-length introduction to the postwar bibliographical approach to editing, and some reviewers welcomed the book as such. J. C. Maxwell, for instance, reviewing it in the Review of English Studies (1957), said, "Few recent books give the reader a comparable sense of being right on the frontier of knowledge." Herbert Davis's review, in Modern Language Notes (1956), was typical of many that Bowers was to receive over the years in that it mentioned "his usual vigor and thoroughness," found his prose style difficult (the lectures are "written by an expert who does not always follow the more plain and easy way"), and combined admiration for Bowers with a trace of suspicion about bibliography ("There is a dangerous fascination in the very pursuit of these elaborate investigations and he is to be congratulated in the way he preserves his critical sense and good judgment"). A similar hint of disapproval is present in C. J. Sisson's generally respectful treatment of Bowers as "the central figure in the present energetic school of research which is represented in the admirable series of Studies in Bibliography " ( Modern Language Review , 1956). The most severe criticisms of the book were made by Greg in Shakespeare Quarterly (1956). He objected to Bowers's minimizing of the importance of "foul papers," but he reserved his strongest invective for an attack on Bowers's style, which he regarded as "a parade of technical and pseudo-scientific language" and "a fog of verbiage." After giving numerous examples of "pretentious writing" and of the "shaky syntax" that results from a "lack of precise thinking," he noted that clear writing comes at "the price of constant vigilance and revision" and suggested that Bowers "has taken no less pains to write obscurely." (These comments were no doubt still in Bowers's mind four years later when he wrote, in his obituary of Greg for the American Philosophical Society, that Greg's "sense of outrage at violations of proper standards, and of clear English, could result in devastating criticisms.") When the book was republished in a new printing eleven years after the first (in 1966), with two subsequent lectures (from the 1962 Shakespeare Jahrbuch and the 1966 SB ) added, T. H. Howard-Hill wondered (in Shakespeare Studies , 1968) why some revision to accommodate Greg's strictures had not been undertaken. And E. A. J. Honigmann used the occasion to lament (in The Library , 1968) what seemed to him Bowers's excessive attention to popularizing: "In so far as he writes as a salesman, or a prophet, to convert the unfaithful to 'the bibliographical way', one can applaud. But, since he also happens to be the most influential man in his field, I regret that he is more interested in the hard sell than in the harder reading." Bowers himself saw no difficulty in being both a bibliographical evangelist and a productive scholar, but his reviewers frequently did question the combination. This issue, having surfaced with his first book on editing, refused to go away. It may in fact have been reinforced by Bowers's choice of subject for his next series of lectures, because the gist of his Sandars Lectures in 1958 was substantially the same as that of the earlier series. The principal differences were the greater range of illustrative examples (since the nominal topic was no longer exclusively Shakespeare) and the greater attention to the role of textual concerns in literary criticism. The first lecture, "Textual Criticism and the Literary Critic," is a most effective polemic, an expert weaving together of instances—from the literature of four centuries—that show how literary critics (and editors) have been misled by failing to investigate the textual history of the works they were concerned with. It deserves to be considered a classic essay: it remains an ideal introduction to the need for textual criticism in the study of literature, if one is approaching literature from the point of view of authorial intention. Bowers's own sense of its effectiveness may be reflected in the fact that he chose it (but not the other two Sandars lectures) for his 1975 volume of collected essays. When the Times Literary Supplement reported on the Sandars series two weeks later (on 7 February 1958), this was the lecture that seems to have influenced most of the comments—such as the title "The Critics Criticized" and the statement that "in spite of the urbanity of approach which one would expect from a visitor from Charlottesville the critics came in for some rough handling." A further sense of the occasion can be gleaned from another comment that remarks on Bowers's "formidable artillery" in criticizing critics: This lively series of lectures was well received by a large and appreciative audience; and if, to some of his hearers, the Professor appeared to take an exceptionally austere view of the functions of criticism, the lecturer's honesty of purpose robbed many of his shafts of their barbs. When the lectures are printed it is understood that some of the severest strictures, removed for oral presentation, will be restored. Bowers's own version of the latter point appeared in his preface to the published volume, Textual and Literary Criticism , which Cambridge University Press published on 28 February 1959, scarcely more than a year after the lectures were delivered: "A few excisions made in deference to the patience of my hearers have been restored for the more leisurely reader." In that preface he described the contents of the volume as "something of a mixed bag" but stated a unifying "rationale": "Literary criticism is viewed as directly dependent upon expert textual criticism." The second lecture was devoted to Whitman's revisions for the 1860 edition of Leaves of Grass (and was based on Bowers's research for his 1955 edition of Whitman's manuscripts); this lecture was called by John Carter, in the Gold Medal citation mentioned earlier, a "fascinating detective story" that "no one who heard it or has read it will forget." And the third lecture, "The New Textual Criticism of Shakespeare," traversed the same ground as the Rosenbach Lectures, though with more detailed coverage of the techniques of compositor analysis (by this time there were more to be covered). The salutary insistence that editing is a form of criticism again had pride of place, as in a notable sentence near the end, in which he aligned himself with his old Harvard teacher: "I should prefer the taste and judgement of a Kittredge (wrong as he sometimes was), and of an Alexander, to the unskilled and therefore unscientific operation of a scientific method as if it were the whole answer to the problem and automatically relieved an editor of the necessity to use his critical judgement in any way" (p. 116). The published volume included a fourth lecture, delivered before the Bibliographical Society in London on 23 January 1958, the day after the last of the Sandars Lectures in Cambridge. "Principle and Practice in the Editing of Early Dramatic Texts" explained the rationale for critical old-spelling editions (that is, those with eclectic unmodernized texts), offering a spirited argument for regarding old-spelling texts not as "specialised scholarship" over the heads of students, but rather as "the normal means of reading the literature of an earlier period." The lecture, and thus the book, ended on this note: The methods by which we can contrive that textual good money should drive out the bad are so obvious and so sane as to reflect seriously on our competence as teachers and as scholars if we reject this offered good and do not shape the editing of texts to our purposes instead of to the purposes of the publishers of textbooks and the laziness or timidity, but often only the inexperience, of our amateur academic editors. (p. 150) This sentence is a fair example of the Bowers style—impassioned, colorful, blunt, flowing, even breathless. The polemical tone repeatedly troubled reviewers, as it had earlier bothered some members of the audience. Alice Walker (whose work Bowers respected, as he indicated by publishing it in Studies and by conducting extensive correspondence with her in the 1950s) said in the Review of English Studies (1960), "This book . . . is not, as a whole, agreeable work. The status of bibliography is not increased by belittling other studies which play an essential part in textual criticism and it will fall into disrepute if the claims made for it are exaggerated or ill-founded. . . . it is because the latter part of this book seems to jeopardize the status of bibliography that I must join issue with it." She was herself a skillful user of analytical bibliography, but she felt that it "should not be so much all over the place as in these chapters." Similarly, D. F. McKenzie, who was later to express in detail his distrust of analytical bibliography, complained about the tone: "the manner here adopted towards critics seems more calculated to arouse resentment than to encourage patronage" ( The Library , 1959). And Joseph S. M. J. Chang, reviewing the 1966 paperback reprint of the book, believed that "One might find his withering contempt for critics who are not particular about the editions they use less objectionable if it was not so singularly aimed at the students of imagery and ambiguity" ( Modern Language Journal , 1968). Chang's own critical predilections made him particularly alert to slights directed at formalist critics, but he was right to call attention to a key passage that revealed Bowers's seeming eagerness to attack the New Criticism: Though a poem, like a man, may stand rejoicing in finished maturity, we must surely understand it with superior intimacy if we have watched its growth and seen its perfection in the very act of shaping. There is such a thing as love, I should urge, in our response to a perfect poem. The current games of intellectual chess, of subjectively drawn tensions, ambiguities, and discordia concors , too often overlook or overlay that simple act of love, which the textual critic may help us toward in his concern for the childhood and adolescence, awkward or charming, of the living seed of a writer. (pp. 17-18). Although these lines are indeed weakened by the bias they reflect and by the superficiality of the contrast between the literary "act of love" and the New Criticism, they are notable for showing Bowers's sense of literary values; his emphasis on physical evidence sprang from—and was not divorced from—his love of literature and his understanding of the place of literature in human life. Several reviewers emphasized such strengths in the lectures while glancing at what they regarded as shortcomings: Herbert Davis, who thought it "a little odd" that Bowers would need to defend textual criticism at Cambridge, nevertheless considered the defense "splendid and impassioned" ( Book Collector , 1959); R. A. Foakes, who quarrelled with Bowers's double advocacy of old-spelling editions for scholars and modernized editions for a general audience, believed that Bowers here "puts compendiously into perspective the significance of his own work, and that of the school of bibliographers he has fostered through his editorship of Studies in Bibliography " ( Shakespeare Quarterly , 1960); and Bowers's former student Cyrus Hoy, who found the lectures "polemical in tone," also regarded them "as the definitive account of the function of textual bibliography at the present time" ( PBSA , 1959)—a judgment that in retrospect seems correct. Bowers's ability to disturb his audiences continued unabated in his third series of lectures, the Lyell in 1959—judging from John Crow's comments (in the Spring 1965 Book Collector ) on the book that derived from them, Bibliography and Textual Criticism (1964). Crow was an ardent admirer of Bowers's approach, and he therefore was disappointed by adverse audience reaction: "I was mystified," he said, "when, at times during the giving of the lectures, I saw eminent heads being shaken." Even Crow, like almost everyone else, felt that Bowers "seems at times to argue too forcibly" and "to be so anxious to prove the value and virtue of Bibliography that he claims too largely for the good woman"; but he nevertheless found the book "admirable and enthralling," "often difficult" but "never dull." Bowers had worked on these lectures—before and after delivery—as one of his activities during his Guggenheim Fellowship of 1958-59. (He later reported to the Foundation that, in addition to making substantial progress on his major project, his Restoration drama bibliography, he had gone "much deeper" into the text of Dryden, used a fortnight to go over galley proof for the last volume of his Dekker edition, and written the "first draft of a book . . . based on a series of lectures at Oxford." He added, "I think I can say that I was not idle.") But he took a considerable time to complete his preparation of the lectures for publication: the foreword is dated 23 February 1963, four years after they were delivered (and the book did not come out for another year). He made clear, however, that he did not substantially revise them but added nineteen pages of discursive notes as well as many footnotes referring to recent scholarship. One of the reasons for the delay may have been a desire to make specific page citations of Charlton Hinman's The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963), but in the end he let his book go to press before published copies of Hinman's book were available. He referred to Hinman's work frequently, however, having read the typescript of it in 1957-58 and, indeed, having followed Hinman's exciting research since the days when Hinman was his student. (He recalled "the various discussions we had . . . about the import of the evidence that he was to consider with such superb originality and clarity"; and thirteen years later, in his obituary of Hinman for the Book Collector , he called Hinman's book "the supreme example in this century of analytical bibliography.") The appearance of Hinman's and Bowers's books in two consecutive years symbolizes their status as the linked monuments of the flourishing postwar period of analytical bibliography. If Bibliography and Textual Criticism is not the masterpiece that Hinman's book (or Bowers's own earlier Principles ) is, it nevertheless has a significant place in bibliographical history. That Bowers himself thought highly of it is suggested by his selecting it (rather than either of the two preceding books) to dedicate to his wife. (The Rosenbach volume had been dedicated to Philip Williams, his former student, who had died on 15 March 1955, while the book was in press; and the Sandars volume carried no dedication.) He later referred to the book as "misunderstood" (in a letter to me on 12 December 1972), and the reason is perhaps not far to seek. Those who wished that Bowers would spend more time on original research were naturally not receptive to what may have seemed a rehashing of points made twice before in book form. Bowers acknowledged in the foreword, "I have made no effort to offer fresh original research except in the final lecture," and he stated explicitly that the lectures "were designed for an informed general audience such as is found in a university." The subject was "method alone," and the examples were "discussed only as illustrations of method." The two preceding series of lectures could be described the same way, and both of them could be said to deal with "the nature of bibliographical thinking." Thus one might uncharitably conclude that this book was mere repetition and fail to understand its different focus. Bowers reported that his original plan had been a "fuller survey" of the relationship between bibliography and textual criticism, but what came to interest him more was "the nature of bibliographical evidence as applied to textual problems," his feeling of a need to examine "the way in which the bibliographical mind works." As a result this book is more abstract than the preceding two. One might say—oversimplifying to suggest the general tendencies of the three books—that the earlier two are driven by the illustrative examples, whereas in this one abstract concepts are the driving force; and although all three are concerned with the bibliographical basis of editing, the focus of the first two is clearly on editing, whereas the third one is really about analytical bibliography and its role in working out textual genealogy. What it sets out to do is to explore "the nature of the evidence on which textual bibliography operates, the logical forms of its reasoning, the techniques it uses, and the results it can achieve" (p. 7). The first two lectures treat the first two of these topics (and contain the famous, or perhaps notorious, sentence, "When bibliographical and critical judgement clash, the critic must accept the bibliographical findings and somehow come to terms with them" [p. 29]); the next three lectures take up the third topic by examining "The Interpretation of Evidence" under the heads of "three orders of certainty" ("the demonstrable," "the probable," and "the possible"); and the sixth lecture, offering a case study of "The Copy for the Folio Othello ," illustrates the results of bibliographical analysis. The book does not attempt to provide for analytical bibliography what the Principles did for descriptive bibliography, and it is thus not a systematic guide to the techniques of analytical bibliography (as Hinman's work in many ways is, though not intended as a textbook). But what it tries to do is even more basic: to furnish a model for thinking about physical evidence and a framework for evaluating conclusions based on such evidence. The most searching criticisms this book received came from J. K. Walton and Trevor H. Howard-Hill. Walton (in Shakespeare Survey , 1966), besides responding in detail to Bowers's disagreements with his work on the copy for folio Richard III , complained that Bowers "overrates the role of bibliography in establishing genetic relationship." Although Bowers's enthusiasm did sometimes result in overstatements, I think he would not disagree with Walton's point that "we cannot study the history of a text as we would, say, the history of a fossil," because the transmission of a text from one edition to another requires the intervention of a compositor's mind. Bowers was certainly not claiming to eliminate literary judgments from the analysis of textual relationships, but the insistent tone of his emphasis on those instances in which physical evidence precluded or limited literary arguments does make understandable the kind of response Walton engaged in, which tended, in its turn, to concentrate on the limitations of physical evidence. Howard-Hill (in Shakespeare Studies , 1968) showed himself to be one of those not entirely happy with Bowers's tendency to spend more time as a spokesman for the field than as a research scholar. His two principal criticisms were that Bowers's interest in discussing bibliographical evidence led him to neglect other kinds of evidence and that his treatment of the logical processes of bibliographical method was "simplistic." In regard to the first, Howard-Hill recognized that Bowers's concern was " only with those problems for which bibliographical analysis has, or pretends to have, some relevance." It is the second criticism that is more serious, because many readers may have shared Howard-Hill's "difficulty in deciding whether a simple text-book of logic would not better have served the novice in these studies, for although Professor Bowers writes of 'bibliographical logic,' reflection assures us that there is nothing peculiar to bibliographical evidence which demands a logical treatment different from that of other disciplines in order to obtain valid conclusions." Bowers's rhetoric was no doubt—as in so many other instances—the culprit, for he obviously knew that he was not proposing a distinct kind of logic. His discussion may indeed seem simplistic to those who are experienced in bibliographical analysis; but he was addressing his remarks to the vast majority of literary scholars (including many editors) who did not (and still today do not) understand what "bibliographical evidence" is or know how to think in terms of such evidence. Bowers's lectures attempted to explain how to apply logic—ordinary logic—to an unfamiliar category of evidence, and therein lies their importance. When, five years later, D. F. McKenzie published his influential article "Printers of the Mind," he was raising questions that Bowers in these lectures had provided the framework for answering. After citing instances of incautious generalizations based on bibliographical analysis, McKenzie reported "a feeling of mild despondency about the prospects for analytical bibliography." Bowers's open-mindedness is shown by his printing this article in Studies , when he had in effect already replied to it. His Lyell Lectures are founded on an understanding of the risks of inductive reasoning and, at the same time, a recognition of the necessity for it, if the great body of physical evidence hidden in books is to be tapped. That such evidence is sometimes incorrectly interpreted, or inappropriately applied to textual criticism, offers no reason for being any less excited over the prospects for its use; Bowers's book conveys that excitement while outlining a cautious and responsible approach to bibliographical evidence and its place in scholarly editing. Bowers's campaign to promote bibliographical and textual studies was carried on in a number of other lectures during the 1950s, in addition to the three major series. Although his lectures were adjusted to fit audiences with varying degrees of bibliographical knowledge, nearly all of them were general treatments of the importance and methodology of bibliographical work, bolstered with numerous illustrations. For example, in one of his earliest bibliographical lectures outside Charlottesville, he spoke on "Bibliography and the University" at the University of Pennsylvania on 13 May 1949; in the fall of that year (9 September 1949) he chose the topic "Some Relations of Bibliography to Editorial Problems" for the English Institute at Columbia University; on 9 May 1952 he addressed a joint meeting in Charlottesville of the Bibliographical Society of America and the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia on "Bibliography, Pure Bibliography, and Literary Studies"; six months later (18 November 1952), in London, he took up "Purposes of Descriptive Bibliography" before the Bibliographical Society; in the spring of that 1952-53 Fulbright year he delivered a lecture at Bedford College, University of London, on "Shakespeare's Text and the Bibliographical Method" (4 March 1953); in the spring of 1954 he gave the Phi Beta Kappa address at Randolph-Macon College on "Scholarship, Research, and the Undergraduate Teacher"; on 17 September 1954 he addressed the English Institute on "McKerrow's Editorial Principles for Shakespeare Reconsidered"; at the 1957 Modern Language Association meeting in Madison, Wisconsin, he read a paper on "Old-Spelling Editions of Dramatic Texts" (10 September 1957); when the Grolier Club met in Charlottesville (with the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia) on 25 October 1958, he spoke on "Textual Criticism and the Literary Critics"; and on 14 November 1958 he delivered, at Charlton Hinman's university, the sixth University of Kansas Annual Public Lecture on Books and Bibliography, entitling it "The Bibliographical Way" (published as a pamphlet the next year). Several times during the 1950s he also came to the aid of his own Bibliographical Society, at Virginia, delivering not only the inaugural paper in 1947 but such later ones as "Textual and Literary Study" (9 April 1957) and "The Growth of Whitman's Leaves of Grass as Shown by Its Manuscripts" (10 April 1958). Most of these lectures were later published, and altogether in the fifteen years after the war he published some five dozen bibliographical articles, along with nearly two dozen reviews. Among the most significant were two of the earliest, his "Notes on Standing Type in Elizabethan Printing" in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America in 1946 and "An Examination of the Method of Proof Correction in Lear ," in The Library the next year (a paper extended into "Elizabethan Proofing" for the 1948 festschrift for Joseph Quincy Adams and regarded as standard for some years and as "ingenious"—to use Peter Blayney's 1982 adjective, in The Texts of King Lear and Their Origins —even when questioned). Another important piece was "The Problem of the Variant Forme in a Facsimile Edition" ( The Library , 1952), which underlay his highly critical review ( Modern Philology , 1955) of the Yale facsimile of the Shakespeare First Folio and which set forth questions first addressed in a facsimile in Hinman's Norton Facsimile of the First Folio (1968). One other article that attracted considerable attention was "Hamlet's 'Sullied' or 'Solid' Flesh: A Bibliographical Case-History" in Shakespeare Survey for 1956. Bowers entered the tangled debate over this famous crux in order to point out that the Second Quarto's "sallied" (1.2.129) and "sallies" (2.1.39) were set by different compositors and printed on different presses and thus to "prove on physical evidence" that no connection between the two existed—allowing for the conclusion that both words are correct (i.e., that the meaning in each case is "sully" and that "sally" is an acceptable variant spelling). The article did not end the controversy but from then on played a prominent role in it. His short piece on The Wits in Strickland Gibson's A Bibliography of Francis Kirkman (1949) deserves brief mention as an indication of some of the work that Bowers was doing in connection with his bibliography of Restoration drama: Gibson's preface noted that Bowers was engaged in an examination of Kirkman's piracies and that his chapter on The Wits was a part of an uncompleted larger study. Although Bowers was primarily recognized for his bibliographical and textual work, he continued to write critical essays and published during this period a dozen of them. One that became particularly well known was "Hamlet as Minister and Scourge" (read in December 1954 at the Shakespeare Section of the Modern Language Association convention and published in PMLA in 1955), which took Hamlet's self-assessment as "scourge and minister" to be his "clearest analysis . . . of his own predicament"; Bowers explained Hamlet's procrastination through an examination of the Elizabethan understanding of "scourge" (the damned agent of private revenge) and "minister" (the divinely appointed agent of public benefaction). Three years later, in the issue of PMLA celebrating the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Modern Language Association, this article was named as one of the eight most "outstanding and influential" PMLA articles on Shakespeare: one of three anonymous Shakespeare specialists called on for reports named it, describing it as "both very learned and very sensible." Even Greg, who had severely criticized Bowers's style in the Rosenbach Lectures, said that this article "can be read with pleasure." And David Bevington represented many others when, years later, he testified to how "deeply" the essay had influenced his thinking (he is quoted on the jacket of Bowers's 1989 volume of Shakespeare essays). On 4 March 1959, the day before Bowers arrived in England on his first Guggenheim Fellowship, Greg died at the age of eighty-three, and from that moment Bowers was unquestionably the most prominent bibliographical and textual scholar in the English-speaking world. Bowers's obituary of Greg in The Library was full of warm praise for his "Logical thinking, great thoroughness, and . . . original turn of mind operating on the frontiers of knowledge": The effect of a great scholar is not to be measured only in terms of the influence of his writings, or even of his private conversation and criticism. That such a man as Greg existed was in itself enough to make us in America feel an inspiration and also an incentive. Certainly, knowing that he would apply his standards, whether in private or in public, to any work we produced acted as a remarkable stimulation to excellence. This moving tribute offers an insight into the influence Greg had on Bowers; it can also be taken as a fair statement of the way many scholars since then have felt about Bowers's own presence. As the 1950s ended, Bowers was the leader of his field, having earned that position by a remarkable fifteen years' work that included the writing of a classic book, the founding and editing of a seminal journal, the delivery of three major lecture series, and the production of two landmark editions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III As the 1960s began, several changes were about to occur in the routine of the Bowerses' lives together. That routine, as it had developed over the postwar decade and a half, was of course primarily structured by the academic year—though professional duties, inside and outside the university, did not prevent his finding time to judge dog shows, write a column on classical recordings, and participate actively in a stamp club. In the summers Nancy Hale went to live with her mother on Cape Ann, north of Boston, and Bowers taught at the University of Chicago. Otherwise they generally traveled together, both on trips abroad (usually biennial in the 1960s and 1970s, often lasting only a week or two in the 1960s and three months in the 1970s) and on short excursions for research or lecturing in the United States. A charming photograph of the two of them at one of the Bread Loaf Writers Conferences—where she was an instructor in fiction-writing from 1957 to 1965 and delivered as lectures some of the sprightly and perceptive essays later collected in The Realities of Fiction (1962)—indicated what a striking couple they made. Both were epitomes of graciousness and urbanity, with commanding presences, and seemed taller than they actually were (he was 5'10'', and she was two or three inches shorter); her graying hair was swept upward to form a coiffure that contributed to the regality of her bearing, and his nearly permanent smile, early balding, and rather full and ruddy face, together with his notably erect posture, conveyed an air of authority and of amused worldliness. His flair for the dramatic is suggested by two vignettes of the late 1960s and early 1970s: his entry into a committee room, flinging off his cape and taking snuff in the correct manner (snuff being at this time his substitute for the previously ever-present cigarette in a long holder); and his arrival at an important faculty meeting, fresh from the Farmington Hunt, wearing his riding habit (whereupon his impassioned speech favoring the retention of the foreign-language requirement carried the day). The Bowerses handled themselves with style and were a memorable couple not only on the Charlottesville scene (where they regularly attended the university concert series and participated in social events) but also in academic circles abroad (where they were welcome guests, always remarkably informed about the local cultural and culinary situation). What most altered the pattern of their lives at the beginning of the 1960s were their building a house and his taking on the chairmanship of the English department; a similarly notable shift in the middle of the decade was his giving up his Chicago teaching in favor of summers on Cape Ann. Through the 1950s the Bowerses' Charlottesville residence was at 2016 Minor Road, a short walk west of the university grounds and north of the football stadium. Glimpses of life there crop up in Nancy Hale's wonderful autobiographical writings. In A New England Girlhood (1958, dedicated to Bowers), she reported, "I live in a house that has no view at all, since our Virginia town is set in a cup in the mountains. . . . However, the inside of my house is charming to look at—dark-green walls downstairs, with white woodwork, and upstairs, lighter colors. In one bedroom I have a blue paper that reminds me of the paper in my old nursery" (p. 7). A later chapter depicted a typical evening: I'm tired when I get the dishes done at night, and glad to follow my husband into the living room and read the evening paper. He's finished with it by that time, and the boys are upstairs doing their homework, and we can be quiet and peaceful in the family circle, hoping to goodness nobody drops in. (p.79) And in The Life in the Studio (1969), a recollection of Minor Road led to further reflection: These autumn Saturdays, usually just about when we have finished lunch, as I stand in front of the south window in the kitchen of our winter house scraping the dishes over the sink, I will hear a rapid drumbeat, and the sound of martial music is carried to me on the soft November air. It is the University of Virginia band, marching to Scott Stadium for the football game. . . . My husband, who is a professor, takes the reasonable attitude that since he went conscientiously to every football game Brown played when he was an undergraduate, every game Harvard played when he was working for his doctorate, every game Princeton played when he started out as a young instructor until the day it was revealed unto him that football is a dull game that he cares nothing about, he need never waste another Saturday afternoon. (pp. 63-64) In 1960 the Bowerses decided to build a house in the country, on the land they had purchased over a decade earlier—some fifty acres in the wooded hills about five miles north of the university, a tract that later, when the South Fork Rivanna River Reservoir was created, had over a thousand feet of waterfront. The spot they cleared for building was carefully chosen so that the house—unlike the one on Minor Road "with no view at all"—would have a magnificent prospect of tree-covered rolling terrain, leading the eye onward to the Blue Ridge Mountains in the distance. The two-story stucco house that was constructed had a formal and symmetrical interior, later furnished in dissimilar ways by the two occupants. A central front door led through a vestibule into a large living room, decorated in beiges, golds, and pinks and dominated by the dramatic view, seen through a floor-to-ceiling bay window. At the left end was a fireplace, with two facing sofas in front of it, and beside it a door led to Bowers's study; at the right end was the entrance to the dining room, flanked by folding doors that could be opened to reveal twenty-eight speakers for Bowers's record player, along with shelves for housing his record collection. Bowers's small bedroom opened off of his study, and over the living room was a suite (sitting room, bedroom, and bath) for his wife. The cell-like appearance of his bedroom (enlivened only by two Cruickshank-style prints) and his congested but relatively colorless study contrasted with her suite, bright with chintz and filled with family mementos and her parents' artwork, as well as her own cluttered desks. The spaces were designed for two writers to work in: as Doug Kamholz, a local reporter, once said, "New stories are written there. Old ones are restored to authors' original intentions." This house, which the Bowerses named "Woodburn" (but which some of the graduate students—and others—called "the pink palazzo"), was described by Roy Flannagan, Bowers's student in the early 1960s, as "an open neoclassical house that overlooked a vista that would have made Capability Brown proud to have designed it," a place where one could live "an Horatian ideal." One of the early visitors to the house was William Faulkner, who had come to the university in the spring of 1957 under the Balch Program for visiting writers (administered by a committee of which Bowers was a member). Although Faulkner served as writer-in-residence for only two spring semesters, he continued to spend considerable time in Albemarle County until his death in 1962, in order to be near his daughter Jill's family and engage in foxhunting. During the last two years of his life he was present at a number of gatherings at Woodburn and apparently got on well with Nancy Hale—"Miss Nancy," as he called her. (She had supposedly based on him the character Harrington in her 1959 novel, Dear Beast , a book that he read and respected; and she later wrote a revealing memoir of him for the 1 August 1963 number of Vogue .) Well suited to entertaining, Woodburn became the scene of annual departmental picnics and many black-tie dinners as well as a port of call for bibliographers from all over the world. Shortly after the house was finished, Bowers had more obligation than before (as well as facilities) for professional entertaining, since in the fall of 1961 he became chairman of his department. By that time he had established himself as the mainstay of the Renaissance faculty, a dynamic teacher and a tireless participant in departmental affairs. When he had returned from his wartime service, resuming his teaching in the spring term of 1946, he picked up the courses he had previously taught (in Spenser and Milton, seventeenth-century literature, and non-Shakespearean Renaissance drama, plus the graduate-methods and the bibliography courses) and was made Associate Professor. Promotion to Professor came only two years later. Throughout the 1950s he taught those same courses, adding from 1953-54 onward the Shakespeare seminar formerly conducted by James Southall Wilson (who retired in 1951) and from 1956-57 the Shakespeare survey. In his memorial resolution for Wilson, Bowers said that Wilson "made Shakespeare live" for "generations of students." But Bowers's own Shakespeare seminar became even more famous, and in his 1989 volume of essays on Shakespeare he described it in detail, beginning with some thoughts on his relationship to Kittredge: I like to reminisce that I may have escaped the usual fate of his imitators by not having had the opportunity to try my hand at teaching Shakespeare for some years after my degree. In the interval there was time enough to come to terms with my own different capacities, to add to my knowledge of the general Elizabethan drama, and to try to be my own man when it came to investigating Shakespeare. Thus when the opportunity came to initiate an annual series of seminars in Shakespeare, under the pressure of discussion my own interests came to focus on the analysis of Shakespeare's meaning in a somewhat different manner from Kittredge's close verbal explication. It is true that, like him, I selected only five or six plays in a year so that minute attention was possible; and indeed as my seminars developed I reduced this number so that I could spend an entire semester on Hamlet alone. It is also true that in seminar we always had our text open before us so that the discussion could proceed extemporaneously as my own or the students' interest lighted on some passage or often only a phrase. We started, certainly, with what words, and especially the images, actually meant in Elizabethan terms. But this foundation for our study quite naturally expanded to include other matters since Kittredge's notes in his Sixteen Plays took care of much of the groundwork. It followed that larger questions of meaning developed from the textual explication, and my instincts drew me to several main areas of analysis to apply to the plays under consideration. Foremost, because of our extended study of Hamlet , we were drawn to consider what seemed to Shakespeare to constitute the essential elements and procedures of the tragic form. Then we turned to the unique relationship that drama as a genre establishes between playwright and audience. . . . The ethical background of Renaissance tragedy having been established as an interpretative tool, sharpened by the comparison with the Greek, the common ties of thought that linked Shakespeare and his original audience brought in the question of the necessary dramatic implementation. Thereby the analysis of dramatic structure as it evolves into ultimate plot seemed to offer a method for examining the various specific means by which Shakespeare conceived his plays—comedies and histories as well as tragedies—and controlled the reactions of his audiences to the understanding of character and action according to his intentions. (pp. x-xi) Some of the ideas on Hamlet expressed in this class were given a wider audience through the book-length introduction to the play, containing scene-by-scene analyses, that he prepared for 1965 publication in Barnes &amp; Noble's series of "Outline-Guides" for students. His Shakespeare and other literature and bibliography courses won him many followers among the graduate students, including a number who wrote dissertations with him and later became prominent scholars in their own right. One of those from the early 1950s, Irby B. Cauthen, Jr., has recalled that Bowers's students thought of him as a "master teacher." His clarity in explaining details was all the more effective, Cauthen believes, because he "knew when to switch from a movement through particularities to the larger general intellectual history that would provide the imaginative concept for the passage"—and could show "how literature fit within the vast universe of art and life." His respect for his students was shown in his thoughtful comments on their papers and in his repeated statement, reported by Cauthen, "that what really mattered was not the number of cards bearing his name in the library's card catalogue but his students." This concern for students was well expressed by another of his former dissertation students, George Walton Williams: we who have been his students will gratefully remember his care for us and for our professional and private concerns. Though the demands he imposed upon us were, as we thought, overpowering, they were less exacting than those he imposed upon himself. Guide, master, friend—Fred Bowers saw us through our tasks and, introducing us to the society of scholars, did not leave us to wander alone in the windy world. In the corridors of the MLA and in other dimly lit passages, his name was a light in the tunnel; it held back the dark. ( A Keepsake to Honor Fredson Bowers , 1974) Roy Flannagan, still another dissertation student, recently summed up the demands made by Bowers's courses this way: "In his course on Shakespeare's tragedies, I needed to be so sharp for the examination I stood on my head in the hall outside the classroom, just in order to get the blood circulating in my brain, only to get the second-highest grade in the class (after Barbara Mowat): that was the kind of performance he inspired." George L. Geckle, a dissertation student at the same time, remembers Bowers's challenging instructions for the term paper in his Milton course—a six- to seven-thousand-word paper that was "to be original and to solve a problem." Bowers himself met both goals in his Milton lectures, which Geckle describes as "an impressive display that exuded both mastery of his material and true critical authority." Until his retirement in 1975, he continued—even during his chairmanship—to teach the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century and the bibliographical courses in varying combinations. In the bibliography course (which, as of 1962-63, came to be called "Introduction to Textual Criticism and Bibliography for the Literary Student"), the range of detailed examples increased to reflect his editorial projects; in 1966-67, for example, it dealt with "textual problems in Marlowe, Fielding, Hawthorne, and Stephen Crane." A memorable picture of Bowers during his chairmanship, as seen by a student in his Shakespeare class, was contributed by Clive Probyn to the group of tributes gathered in 1991 by the Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand: At a time when all students (and they were almost all male) were expected to dress neatly, Fredson was immaculately dressed, rather like an East Coast dandy, or (in the rusty tweed suit) an English squire. At a time when every-one seemed to drive either Volkswagen Beetles or gas-guzzling, slab-sided monsters, Fredson Bowers drove a very small blue Alfa Romeo—fast. I was but dimly aware of his scholarly eminence, but sensed everywhere the awe in which he was held. I signed up for his graduate Shakespeare class, and at the end of sixteen weeks of weekly two-hour seminars we had "covered" two and [a] half acts of one of the five plays (the Kittredge Shakespeare editions) on the syllabus. I can still talk for about an hour on the first scene of Hamlet (omitted in the recent Franco Zefferelli film version), and I don't think anybody knew more about that play (or Elizabethan ghost psychology, or the problems of textual transmission of Elizabethan texts, or simply the vertiginous depths of literary semantics) than Fredson Bowers. For several weeks we listened to an extraordinary store of accumulated knowledge being unpacked in front of us. It was a technique of explication de texte carried off at the highest level, and I have never experienced it since. Bowers's considerate attention to students is illustrated—from the same period—by his encouragement of Alexander Theroux. Martin Battestin, who has written an account of Theroux's Charlottesville years for the Review of Contemporary Fiction (1991), reports, "It was Bowers, then in the third year of his famous chairmanship, who saw the promise in Alex, not only admitting him to the graduate program but, by some ingenious creative financing, scraping together money enough to help pay his way" (p. 51). Bowers's critical reading of dissertations was similarly undiminished during his chairmanship: in the seven years between 1961 and 1968, ten of his students received their doctoral degrees. All told, he directed (or co-directed) dissertations by twenty-eight students at Virginia: Charlton J. K. Hinman (1941), William D. Hull (1941), Irene Mann Rinehart (1942), Alexander W. Allison (1949), John W. McCutchan (1949), Lawrence G. Starkey (1949), Philip Williams, Jr. (1949), Irby B. Cauthen, Jr. (1951), Marion Hope Hamilton (1952), Dora Jean Ashe (1953), Cyrus H. Hoy (1954), Wallace S. Sanderlin (1955), Elizabeth Brock (1956), George Walton Williams (1957), Robert Kean Turner, Jr. (1958), Matthew J. Bruccoli (1961), Francelia Butler (1963), Brewster S. Ford (1964), Jeanne Addison Masengill (later Roberts, 1964), George L. Geckle (1965), Roy C. Flannagan (1966), Clauston L. Jenkins (1966), William S. Kable (1966), Albert C. Labriola (1966), Herbert R. Blackwell (1967), Joseph L. Simmons (1967), Paul L. Gaston (1970), and Sidney W. Reid (1972). Fifteen of these writers dealt with textual criticism or analytical bibliography (mostly of Renaissance books, but in five instances Restoration, eighteenth-century, or American books were treated), and the other thirteen wrote critical-historical studies, all on Renaissance literature except for one on Dryden and one on Poe. At the time Bowers assumed the departmental chairmanship in the fall of 1961, he had already come to play an influential role in the department. He had been a force behind the scenes during the chairmanship of his predecessor, Floyd Stovall, and was particularly instrumental in the hiring of new assistant professors. During the summer of 1961 he consulted with the three who were to begin in the fall—Martin C. Battestin, David M. Bevington, and Francis Russell Hart—and worked out new courses for them. At his first meeting in the fall he persuaded the tenured members of the department to allow the nontenured ones to vote, and the new courses were then approved by the larger voting group. He set the tone for his chairmanship at this first meeting by showing not only that he had a vision for the department's future but also that he had the skills of administrative strategy to make it a reality. (Furthermore, he knew how to foster a sense of community: he wrote frequent and detailed letters, for example, to Robert Langbaum, who had joined the department the previous year but was on leave in 1961-62, and he regularly stopped by professors' offices for visits.) During the next seven years he proceeded to build the department, not previously considered important in the academic world, into one of the top few English departments in the United States. This achievement is testimony to his astute diplomacy in dealing both with the first-rate scholars he wished to attract and with the university administrators from whom funds were needed. (He always paid credit to the president, Edgar Shannon, for selecting English as one of the departments to receive federal funds then available for improving the faculty.) David Levin remembers Bowers's recruiting letters as conveying "in every line" the image of "a decisive man who knew what he wanted for Virginia, the best faculty he could get. He would try pre-emptive offers, but he did not, like Maynard Mack of Yale at that time, require a firm answer before the first of November." Recently E. D. Hirsch has recalled, An admiring department chairman at another university compared him to the wild-animal trapper Frank Buck, whose motto was "Bring 'em back alive." Those of us who were recruited by Fredson Bowers remember the experience as being more like a whirlwind courtship than the stately protocol that is currently observed. The stunning roster of faculty recruited by Bowers included (besides Hirsch) Ralph Cohen, Douglas Day, Hoyt N. Duggan, William Elwood, Irvin Ehrenpreis, Alan Howard, George Garrett, Arthur C. Kirsch, Harold H. Kolb, Jr., V. A. Kolve, Cecil Y. Lang, J. C. Levenson, Peter Taylor, Charles Vandersee, and Anthony Winner. One can understand why Douglas Day called the department "better than excellent . . . superb" and said of it, "There's a kind of electricity in the community . . . something that encourages writing"—a statement chosen by Virginius Dabney for inclusion in his history of the university, where credit is given to Bowers for bringing the situation about ( Mr. Jefferson's University [1981], p. 464). The acquisition of outstanding scholars was not, however, the only aspect of the department's welfare to which Bowers gave energetic attention; one of his primary concerns was the relation of teaching to a graduate program (a subject on which he was becoming increasingly vocal on a national level), and he oversaw the department's successful 1966 application to the Danforth Foundation for the institution of a program for "College Teaching Career Fellows"—a program that (in the words of the proposal) "should serve as a model that will influence educational theory in this country." The achievements of Bowers's chairmanship came at the price of some hard feelings, for his decisiveness was not always seen in a favorable light: George Garrett, for instance, has depicted him running the department with "a heavy hand, if not an iron one" ( Whistling in the Dark [1992], p. 155). But to most people the benefits of his chairmanship far outweighed such drawbacks. Testimony to Bowers's lasting influence on the department came in 1980 when the department decided to name its library in his honor; on that occasion V. A. Kolve, then the chairman, wrote to him, "You are not only the Founding Father, so to speak, of what we collectively are; but you remain an important source of the energy and good sense that continues to hold us together." After seven years in the chairmanship (1961-68), Bowers agreed to accept the position of Dean of the Faculty. ("A relief, in fact, to be rid of the emotional involvement with building a department," he wrote to Jo Ann Boydston on 24 September 1968.) He brought to this position the same abilities and the same concentration, as many have testified. One of the professors he hired at this time, David Rubin of the French department, remembers his interview well, not merely because Bowers wore riding clothes but because Bowers seemed to have read his mind, understanding precisely why he wanted to move and what he would like to have at Virginia. To those he recruited, Bowers made clear his own belief in the importance of a faculty strong in both research and teaching, and first-class scholars could see—from Bowers's own impressive record of publication and teaching as well as from his conversation—that they were dealing with a kindred spirit. Among his accomplishments during 1968-69 were the expansion of the Religious Studies department (though he had no personal interest in religion) and the establishment of the Environmental Sciences department. Despite his skill at the deanship, he did not have his heart in the job as he did when he was constructing the English department. His energy, though phenomenal, had its limits, and he was increasingly feeling the need to find more time for his editorial projects. Although he had provisionally consented to hold the deanship for two years, he decided to give it up after a single year. E. D. Hirsch has said, "Those who dealt with Dean Bowers—department chairmen and professors alike—soon learned two things about him, that he had tough, demanding standards, and that he was completely fair and disinterested." The same would also be said by most of the hundreds of students who passed through his courses. One evidence of Bowers's love of teaching was his desire to teach in the summers at the University of Chicago, despite his heavy academic-year schedule and his many extracurricular activities. With Allen Hazen's departure for Columbia in 1948, the University of Chicago English department was left without a bibliographical specialist, and Bowers filled that gap in the summer quarter of 1949 as the Frederic Ives Carpenter Visiting Professor in English. He liked the arrangement, and he returned there for the following fifteen summers, his title changing to Professorial Lecturer in English. Over that long period, he taught much more than bibliography. Besides a course in "Bibliography and the Techniques of Literary Scholarship" and a seminar called "Problems in Bibliographical Analysis," he gave courses at various times in Spenser and pre-1642 English drama and a seminar in the textual criticism of Elizabethan drama. According to Gwin Kolb, who received his Ph.D. from Chicago and joined the regular departmental faculty the same year as Bowers's first teaching there, his courses were "brilliant triumphs": "Students who came to scoff at his brand of bibliography remained to admire—and to become converts." He undoubtedly saw his Chicago teaching as an opportunity to spread the bibliographical word, and his principal bibliography course was indeed influential, in part because one of the prominent library schools was on campus and a number of future rare-book librarians enrolled in his course. Bowers's influence also traveled through other faculty members: Bernard Weinberg of the Romance Languages department, for example, was interested in Bowers's approach, which thus came to play a role in a series of editions that Weinberg supervised. The key moment for bibliographical history in Bowers's Chicago summers, however, occurred in the very first one. William B. Todd had just completed his dissertation, entitled "Procedures for Determining the Identity and Order of Certain Eighteenth-Century Editions," and the defense was scheduled for that summer. Bowers was already familiar with the direction of Todd's work from a talk Todd had given in Charlottesville the previous December, and he had scheduled an article of Todd's for the 1949 volume of Studies in Bibliography ; but he had not read Todd's detailed study until asked to serve on the examining committee. He naturally recognized the extraordinary importance of Todd's application of analytical techniques to eighteenth-century books; and after an excited reading of the dissertation, he arrived at the defense with many scribbled pages of questions. Bowers's debut at Chicago, in effect, was thus his participation in an animated dialogue with Todd, while the other members of the committee listened in largely uncomprehending silence. When the committee moved into private session, Bowers explained how truly pioneering Todd's work was, opening up a whole area of research, and insisted that Todd's degree be awarded with honors. He then hastened to a telephone and called his editor at the Princeton University Press in order to make a last-minute addition, based on what he had just learned about press figures from Todd's dissertation, to his forthcoming Principles of Bibliographical Description . The "Addendum" on page 321 of the published volume was the result: it referred to Todd's dissertation as the most comprehensive demonstration of the "high value" of press figures in distinguishing impressions, announced that portions of the dissertation would appear in the third volume of Studies in Bibliography , and asserted that henceforth press figures would have to be recorded in descriptive bibliographies. Over the years Bowers himself directed two dissertations at Chicago, those of Frederick O. Waller (1958) and Shirley Strum Kenny (1965), both critical editions of plays; and he participated in other departmental affairs as well. His contributions to the department prompted on three different occasions the offer of a full-time position there, and each time he turned it down. But he clearly enjoyed those summers, and his presence in Chicago is memorably described in a letter (10 January 1992) from Gwin Kolb, who with his wife saw Bowers frequently: As I recall, Fredson always drove to Chicago in a shiny Jaguar, which he was very fond of and very adroit in handling. [And he made the eighteen-hour drive nonstop.] I remember, too, the portable microfilm reader he brought with him and used constantly when he wasn't teaching, seeing students or colleagues, working in the Library, or writing. . . . You are aware . . . of his delight in good food and drink. Being also very sociable, he often invited small groups to dine at excellent, modestly priced, ethnic restaurants he had a wonderful knack of "discovering." In return, Chicagoans, charmed by his wit and courtliness (and occasionally awed by his learning and argumentative prowess), frequently entertained him in their homes. Like a number of other persons who were present, I vividly remember a particular evening in our apartment, where Fredson held the other guests spellbound with an impromptu talk on the fascinating science—or art—of judging dogs entered in shows. Among the acquaintances Bowers would have seen in Chicago was Allan Stevenson, whose work he had included in the first volume of Studies : in those years Stevenson was living in the University of Chicago neighborhood. Bowers managed to accomplish some bibliographical research in Chicago, but he rarely traveled up to the Newberry Library, though he did pay occasional visits there to Gertrude Woodward (whose checklist of Restoration drama he had supplemented in 1949). Despite the satisfactions of his Chicago summers, he decided after sixteen years to bring them to an end: as he wrote me (on 25 June 1965), "I have decided to give up my arrangement there and maybe live a few years longer and get a little more work done. Summers are about the only time I have to do my own work these days." The University of Chicago recognized his role in the life of the university, and in the world of scholarship generally, by awarding him the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 1973. Beginning with the summer of 1965, then, Bowers was free to spend more time with his wife on Cape Ann, and for the next quarter-century their summers together at Folly Cove, Rockport, were a major element in the rhythm of their lives. The stone house, Howlets, which had belonged to Nancy Hale's aunt and then her mother, came to mean a great deal to Bowers, though it did not have the childhood associations for him that it did for his wife. (In a letter of 9 October 1987, he wrote, "I have grown very fond of the place but wish the water were warmer for swimming. It's too cold for me except maybe 3-4 days a summer.") The house and its setting high on a wooded hill are affectionately described in a number of passages in Nancy Hale's writings. Perhaps the loveliest account of the surroundings occurs in The Realities of Fiction (1962): Our house there is on a granite hill, looking across a small, cuplike blue cove to a point of land which is pink where the sun falls on its solid rock, and beyond it to Ipswich Bay. We bathe off sun-warmed glacial boulders that rim the cove. To the left, the land at the end of the cove rises—a slope where locust trees grow thickly, their bark as dry and white as bones. Generations of children have called it the magic or the fairy wood. To the right, outside the cove's mouth, the ocean stretches northeast without a break between us and Portugal. If one lets the eye slide back, southward, along the horizon, Mount Agamenticus in Maine can, on a clear day, be seen. Still farther along, the shapes of Newburyport and then of Ipswich are visible, the silhouettes of their houses and trees tiny and accurate as toy model villages beyond the green-streaked, dark-blue bay. (pp. 216-217) The house itself, built in 1911 of granite quarried from its own cellar, was constructed by a Swedish mason to look like a northern European farmhouse. (Bowers often said it was colder and damper than it should have been because the mason did not leave an air space in the walls.) After Philip L. Hale's death in 1931, his sister, Ellen Day Hale, who had built the house as her summer studio, presented it to his widow, Lilian Westcott Hale, who for the next three decades used it as her summer studio. Although in her later years she lived in Charlottesville (2004 Lewis Mountain Road) to be near her daughter Nancy, the two of them always summered at Howlets. Upon Lilian Westcott Hale's death in 1963, the house passed to Nancy Hale, whose experiences in sorting through the accumulated objects there underlay the moving essays that make up The Life in the Studio (1969)—a marvelous meditation on the relation of past and present, and a book that has become a cult classic. By the time Bowers began spending entire summers at Folly Cove, she had made minor changes to transform the studio into a living room: The confusion was such that I decided the best way to begin was by adding to it with an immense sofa I bought at a furniture sale. I was right; once the sofa was in place it became obvious that the model stand made a good coffee table to set in front of it, and that chairs, loaded down under back issues of Art News and old bulletins of various museums, could be put here, and here. (p. 165) Still other relics of the room's former use remained, for one of the many visitors to Howlets, John Frederick Nims (the poet who contributed a parody of textual and explicatory criticism to the twentieth volume of SB ), remembered the "comfortably sprawling two-storied studio still a repository for the easels and oil paintings of her celebrated mother" ( Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook 1988 ). Bowers's oldest son, too, recalls "some half finished paintings, an easel together with brushes and partially used paints and other furnishings, not one of which ever changed its place." On many occasions the family gathered for picnics on the rocks overlooking the cove, the Bowerses "cooking hot dogs over a fire built in the crevice of one of the rocks." Another visitor was the neighbor Leon Kroll, who as a painter appreciated what he called the Greek classicism of the cove. (Bowers—in a letter to his oldest son on 8 August 1983—described Kroll as "a salty egoistic firstclass painter, with whom we used to play bridge summers once in a while"; Kroll had known Nancy Hale since she was an adolescent.) In 1983 the Bowerses edited Kroll's reminiscences for the University of Virginia Art Museum (where a large collection of Kroll's work is housed); and Nancy Hale's prefatory "An Appreciation" (from 1980) gave her another opportunity to reveal her feelings about the Folly Cove area, where she was "ravished by the scents, the pristine light, the secret morning conversations between birds." With the Bowerses in residence, Howlets became a writers' study rather than a painter's studio. Packing into the car all the papers they would need at the house each summer was an annual ritual, and they accomplished a satisfying amount of work within its calming and restorative atmosphere. Many of Bowers's students were aware of his love of music, for he regularly met with students in the evenings to play records and comment on them. This interest, which had been evident when he was himself a student, no doubt predated his college years; but Ware's course in music appreciation at Brown may have played a role in the development of his serious interest in classical music. In any event, he certainly attended concerts of the Boston Symphony Orchestra while at Harvard. From then on music was—if, indeed, it had not always been—one of the great passions of his life, and its importance to him is symbolized by the vast amount of writing he did on the subject. His thoughts on music are even more fully available to us than those on dogs and stamps as a result of a weekly column on records that he contributed, during a period of more than a quarter-century, to the Sunday editions of the Richmond Times-Dispatch . It first appeared on 19 November 1939 (when he was still writing a monthly piece on Irish wolfhounds for the American Kennel Gazette ), and the last one was published on 6 November 1966. (He once told David Vander Meulen that he quit when he ran out of adjectives.) In between those dates he wrote 1162 columns, each one averaging about eighteen column-inches in length and all of them together totaling approximately a million and a quarter words. During this long period, in which he commented on more than five thousand recordings, there were only three sizable gaps in his nearly invariable weekly production of columns: from June 1942 through February 1946 his military service coupled with the curtailed production of records allowed him to write only fifty-six columns, and he wrote none at all during two periods abroad, the first on a Fulbright Fellowship (7 September 1952 through 7 June 1953) and the second on a Guggenheim Fellowship (5 April through 2 August 1959). (He did, however, write a report on the London music scene for the issue of 26 April 1953.) His record after his return in 1953 was particularly impressive: except for the 1959 gap of four months, he missed only three columns in thirteen and a half years. The feat seems amazing, when one considers that he did make other (though brief) trips abroad during this time and spent the summers in Chicago: it is testimony not only to his energy and perseverance but also to his love of music, for writing regularly about music was not a burden to him. His column—originally called "Music on Records" (with minor variations), then "Music Off the Records," and finally, from 1950 on, "Music Off Records"—usually followed the pattern of concentrating on what he regarded as the major release of the week, assessing the performance it reproduced and the quality of the reproduction, and then commenting briefly on some other new recordings or recounting some trade gossip. He did not consider it his function to discuss the music itself in detail, but the breadth of his familiarity with music (and with other recordings of the pieces under review) was evident through the allusions and comparisons he made, and his attitudes inevitably emerged in some of his observations on individual performances. These characteristics (along with his concern for advising the reader) are neatly combined in a statement in his first column: commenting on a Columbia recording of Bach's Sonata No. 3 in G Minor for harpsichord and viola da gamba, he asserted that it "is the best of the three that he wrote for these instruments, and beautifully played here [by Ernst Wolff and Janos Scholz], but to an extent it is best appreciated by a full-fledged lover of Bach. For the ordinary listener there are more important Bach recordings." Sometimes he did make outright judgments about the music, as when on 15 February 1942 he proclaimed William Walton's work "brilliant, intense, complex in mood, and warm in feeling," or when on 31 December 1950 he claimed that Samuel Barber's music is "usually thin in content for the form chosen," or when on 8 July 1962 he said, "Mahler's Symphony No. 9 is the greatest symphony of the twentieth century." He felt that "Mostly one can take or leave medieval music" (6 November 1966); the "Haffner" Symphony he considered "the most thoroughly delightful of all Mozart's symphonies" (7 April 1940); regarding the first movement of Brahms's Piano Concerto No. 1, he said, "I feel often that Brahms is lifting himself by his own bootstraps and that the emotional violence is . . . a bit hollow and labored" (14 July 1940); and in Dvorak's Symphony No. 2 he found the composer "still assimilating the Brahms influence," though it "has gone past the stage of imitation" (22 May 1960). Steady readers of the column would have noticed Bowers's developing tastes: on 1 January 1950, for example, he advised only "hardy souls" to "plunge" into the first movement of Charles Ives's Piano Sonata No. 2, since the idiom "takes some listening to penetrate," though after "about 15 hearings the sonata is really fun"; ten years later (3 January 1960) Ives was described as a "talented" composer, and the finale of his New England suite was "one of the most ecstatic pieces of nature music written in America"; and on 16 January 1966 Bowers called Ives "quite simply . . . the best composer that America has produced." His judgments of performers were not normally severe, but he did not hesitate to warn readers about flawed performances: the "comparatively inexperienced" Mildred Miller, for instance, was "most disappointing" in Das Lied von der Erde because she possessed "a voice of insufficent body" and had "little idea of Mahler style" (20 November 1960); and Eleanor Steber's vibrato was "distressing" in a recording of selections from Verdi (17 December 1950). Bowers had certain bêtes noires that came in for regular criticism, such as Leopold Stokowski and Leonard Bernstein (e.g., 1 February 1942, 25 August 1957); but there were others who repeatedly earned high praise, such as Thomas Beecham ("the greatest living conductor of Mozart," 7 April 1940), Bruno Walter ("the great Mahler conductor," 20 November 1960), and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau ("incomparable," 27 March 1966). He made discriminations even among those he admired (on 12 November 1950 he asserted that Arthur Rubinstein's "virtuoso" performance in Schumann's Quintet in E Flat for Piano and Strings lacked "the tenderness and intimacy which Serkin displays"), and he was always glad to recognize new talent, such as Daniel Barenboim ("a new young pianist who is sure to make his mark," as he said in his last column). In the prewar and postwar years, when Bowers was writing, there were many technical developments in the recording industry (not least the shift from 78 rpm to 45 and 33⅓ rpm and the effect of frequency-modulation broadcasting), and he often devoted considerable space to discussing them and advising his readers on how to deal with them. (He regarded the subject of postwar advances in the production of records and record-players important enough for two feature articles on 10 and 17 April 1949, in addition to his regular columns.) His attention to the technical side of record-making, and its effect on the fidelity of the reproductions that result, is of particular interest in view of his work in analytical bibliography and his thorough understanding of the effect of physical media on the texts of the works transmitted by them. Recordings are "editions," and Bowers's approach to them was analogous to his approach to editions of verbal works. Their goal, he felt, should be fidelity to the composers' intentions, and he judged both performance and reproduction from this point of view. In the process he sometimes undertook such experiments as playing the same record on different phonographs (e.g., 1 February 1942) or comparing different copies. Variations among copies of a single printed edition are a fact of life for analytical bibliographers, and Bowers, obviously recognizing the analogy, warned his readers (on 25 April 1943) that "they should play each record side before purchase," since one cannot assume that the pressing is unflawed in all copies. Bowers himself certainly listened to every side before writing a review, noting in the case of one multi-record set that only sides 2 and 10 were "free from some fault." His willingness to invest time in his column is further illustrated by his playing a record one hundred times in order to report on the "wearing qualities" of plastic (30 December 1945) or his standard offer in the 1940s to reply to readers' letters. These columns, taken together, are fascinating as an extended chronicle of the tastes and techniques of the recording industry over a quarter-century, viewed from the uniform perspective of a single lively, sensible, cultivated, and tenacious intelligence. In their authoritative sweep, interrupted occasionally by confessions of the subjectivity of taste, they suggest the depth of Bowers's feeling for music. But for a direct statement of that feeling one must look outside the columns, to a lecture, "The Ideal Record Collector," which Bowers delivered at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond on 5 March 1961, as part of the third series of lectures called "The Eager Listener." This talk, buttressed with thirteen excerpts from recorded music, ranging from Bach and Mozart to Mahler and Bartok, amounted to a mini-course in music appreciation. His aim was to explain how the novice collector of records can gradually develop musical taste and enjoyment and, instead of becoming discouraged and abandoning music, can become an enthusiast for whom music is an essential part of life. He emphasized the importance of beginning with what one naturally likes, not what one is supposed to like, and learning to listen carefully to the language of each instrument before moving on to other pieces. ("Just go ahead," he said, "and learn the musical language from the composers you like to hear tell you stories." Later he added, "Musical tastes cannot help changing, as well as deepening and refining, when music on records becomes a part of one's daily life.") The comparison between the "languages" of music and literature recurs throughout; the language of music can "communicate an emotion, even something of an idea—certainly some form of transferred experience—as much as words can, and oftentimes better than words can": The real basis of understanding musical language is the simple ability to hear what the composer is saying . . . Merely to hear what a composer is saying in his language of sound takes some practice in following the progression of one note after another, as in the progression of one word after another until the meaning of a sentence accumulates at its end. . . . To distinguish the sense from its servant sound in music—as in poetry—requires concentration and active attention. Just as "relatively cultivated people do not necessarily curl up in a chair every night with Virgil's Aeneid or Milton's Paradise Lost in their laps," so one is not always in the mood for the complexity of a symphony. "In this connection," he said, "I want to deliver a strong plug for chamber music on the phonograph as one's usual day-to-day form of music on records, leaving symphonies for special occasions"—not only because of the demands of the two genres ("chamber music invites, whereas symphonic music commands"), but because of the limitations of record-players and living-rooms. Anyone in his audience following his common-sense step-by-step approach would inevitably gain some insight into what music appreciation involves and, more importantly, would witness a case study in what musical enthrallment means. He describes how, with active listening, great music becomes a part of you. And this happens not only when you are listening to records. Music will flood your memory. You will find yourself, in your mind, being a string quartet, or singing all the parts of Don Giovanni, and the orchestra too, as you drive along the road in your auto. When one participates in music in this fashion, it gives "a pleasure that no other art can provide"—it gives a "shiver" up the spine and makes one's "back muscles squinch up with pleasure." Although Bowers admitted that, for him, "Mozart is the prince of composers on records as one's constant companion," he revealed deep admiration for a great variety of styles and genres, from Beethoven's late quartets to the piano concertos of Bartok ("a very great composer"), including operas and songs. This lecture conveyed in concentrated form the breadth of musical knowledge and the depth of musical experience that underlay the columns. In stressing enjoyment—enjoyment that increases, the more one learns—he was in fact expressing his approach to literature as well as to music. But he perhaps felt freer to express his passionate devotion to music, since it was not his professional field and since—on the occasion of this lecture—he was speaking to a similarly nonprofessional audience. At a literary conference he would probably never have stated that "pleasure and culture are NOT antagonistic," but he could say it here. From time to time in his professional writings, his love of literature did get expressed with some explicitness, but such opportunities did not occur frequently. Given the chance, he would certainly have applied to books what he said about records at the beginning of his Richmond lecture: "To have music at one's fingertips is almost life's greatest blessing." Another passion of the same years was stamp collecting. It is likely that more of Bowers's scholarly acquaintances outside of Charlottesville knew about his interest in stamps than were aware of his other avocations, because his envelopes were usually plastered with old stamps and he always asked correspondents to return them to him. Contributors to Studies in Bibliography were accustomed to seeing their proofs arrive in large reused brown envelopes covered with spectacular displays of unfamiliar stamps—the denominations so small that it was necessary for the stamps to be overlapped in order for the required number to fit on the envelopes. (Bowers once told me that he had obtained special permission from the Charlottesville Post Office to overlap the stamps.) Once back in his possession the stamps would be steamed off, none the worse for the overlapping. Correspondents could assume that they had become part of an inner circle when Bowers took for granted that they would return the stamps without being reminded. Bowers did not write as much about stamps as he did about dogs and music, nor was he as well known among philatelists as among record collectors in Virginia and Irish-wolfhound lovers nationally. But he always became knowledgeable about any field he was involved in, and he kept abreast of developments in the stamp-collecting world. In a 1961 history of the first quarter-century of the Charlottesville Stamp Club, prepared by Bernard P. Chamberlain, Bowers was named as one of a small number of members "who keep up better than most with national and international philatelic news and keep the club pretty well informed as to what is going on in the stamp world." Bowers had become a member of this club in 1951 and of the American Philatelic Society in 1954, and the height of his activity in the field of stamps came in the 1950s. He served as vice-president of the club in 1955 and as president in 1956—a significant year in which to be president because on 13 April, Jefferson's birthday, the Charlottesville Post Office was the site for cancellation of first-day covers for the twenty-cent Monticello stamp. The cancellation in fact read "Monticello Rural Station," but because the Rural Station at Jefferson's estate was in a small gift-shop, the covers were canceled by machine in Charlottesville. Bowers and the other members of the club felt, however, that some covers should be canceled at the actual location, and they supervised the canceling of a small number of covers with the hand stamps in use there, one of which carried the misspelling "Montecello." In order to distinguish those with the correct spelling canceled at the Rural Station from those canceled in Charlottesville, Bowers placed his authentication and signature on the reverse of all copies of the former. He also wrote an account of this situation (describing as well the variations in cancellation produced in Charlottesville) for distribution to the philatelic world, and it was printed in the Western Stamp Collector on 19 May 1956. In the same year he wrote articles on highway-post-office postmarks and covers. His interest in this subject may have had a local connection, since the first trip of a highway-post-office bus (on 10 February 1941) was between Washington and Harrisonburg, Virginia, not far from Charlottesville. In any case, he became a member of the National Highway Post Office Society in early 1956 and served on its board of directors for the next several years. He published a general article on highway-post-office cover collecting in Linn's Weeky Stamp News on 26 March 1956: after setting up eight criteria for cover collecting, he showed why this form of cover collecting "scores 100 per cent in a manner unmatched by any other form." For HPO Notes (the journal of the National Highway Post Office Society) he wrote a series of detailed articles, involving considerable research and serving as a basic reference source. One (in three parts, February-April 1956) was a historically annotated checklist of the changeover postmarks in the twenty or so instances between 1952 and 1956 in which highway-post-office buses were operated by railroads and continued to use the railway-post-office postmarks until required to change at the beginning of 1956. This list was followed in succeeding months by a closely reasoned definition of provisional postmarks (July-August 1956) and a consideration of variant provisionals (June and October 1957)—along with a general article on provisionals for Linn's (29 July 1957). Most interesting from a bibliographical point of view, however, was his list of "Current HPO Steels" (January and November 1957, February 1958), in which he worked out a system for describing postmarks—an analogous problem to title-page transcription in bibliographical description. In each of some ninety entries the measurement of the diameter of the postmark in millimeters is followed by a transcription of the circular legend, an indication of the style of killer (canceling bar), and a classification and measurement of the trip indicator. That this list was based on envelopes sent to, and returned by, the foremen of the lines suggests the effort he was willing to invest in amassing philatelic data; and in each of these articles he drew on information from some collections other than his own and asked readers to send him further details. Another specialty of his was British colonials, of which he developed a fine collection as well. In keeping with the Charlottesville Stamp Club's program for encouraging members to collect "topicals," he also collected stamps depicting books and printing; and when the Alderman Library at the University of Virginia mounted an exhibition celebrating the club's twenty-fifth anniversary (22 April-15 May 1961), Bowers's contribution to the show was a set of United Nations stamps. That Bowers should have been interested in stamps is not surprising, since—like books—they are printed artifacts that require, for their study, a detailed knowledge of the process by which they are produced and an understanding of the kinds of variation in the finished product that can result from it. He chose not to collect books, but his collecting of stamps shows that he did have the collecting urge. When he was listening to Geoffrey Keynes's address in 1953—the one in which Keynes criticized Bowers's approach to descriptive bibliography—Bowers had further reason to be annoyed when he heard Keynes say, "Stamp collecting is an amusing game, but it is essentially sterile." Bowers would have seen the shallowness of this statement, for his extended study of the physical evidence in books had given him a profound knowledge of how the details of artifactual evidence contribute to cultural history, and he recognized the application of this insight to all artifacts. Eventually, however, he sold his collection (keeping the United Nations series until 1987) and filled the spring binders in which he had housed it with the notes for his bibliography of Restoration drama—a move that was symbolic of his increasing concentration on that project in his later years. But this kind of shift did not become a general one: Bowers's life of scholarship was always set in a rich backdrop of other enthusiasms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Bowers's scholarship during the decades of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s was largely devoted to editorial projects. As a result, his career, in retrospect, displays a neat and logical pattern: in the first fifteen years following the war, he worked out basic principles and approaches for bibiographical and textual work and wrote major statements setting them forth; in the thirty years after that (exactly split by his formal retirement from Virginia), he applied those principles to the editing of a broad range of writers from the sixteenth century through the twentieth century. He did, of course, produce significant editions of Dekker and Whitman before 1960, but editorial work bulked far less in his activities of that period than did his writing of general discussions of rationale; after 1960 the proportions were dramatically reversed, for his important theoretical statements of these years—a few essays, not books—were overshadowed by the dozens of edited volumes that emerged from his study. This pattern reflects his temperamental preference for the empirical and critical over the theoretical; it also is a manifestation of his love of literature, of his desire to work closely with great pieces of writing—for critical editing (as he well knew and frequently proclaimed) entails the most minute familiarity with and comprehension of the nuances of the material to be edited. This new phase of Bowers's career was inaugurated at the very beginning of the 1960s by his association with The Centenary Edition of the Works of Nathaniel Hawthorne . The origins of this edition (and of other editions of American authors soon to follow) can be traced back to a Committee on Definitive Editions set up in 1947-48 by the American Literature Group of the Modern Language Association of America (MLA); over the next fifteen years tentative plans for several editions of major American authors were formulated (and initial research in some cases actually begun). With this stimulus, three American literature scholars at Ohio State University—William Charvat, Roy Harvey Pearce, and Claude M. Simpson—took on the responsibility for Hawthorne and invited Bowers to become the "Textual Editor" of the new edition. (A link between this group and Bowers was Matthew J. Bruccoli, who in 1961 had just completed his dissertation under Bowers's direction and taken a job in the English department at Ohio State and who then became Bowers's assistant on the Hawthorne project.) By agreeing to undertake the Hawthorne work, Bowers initiated a new era in the editing of writings of recent times, for his presence (and, in short order, his practice) announced to the scholarly world that the editing of nineteenth-century literature required the same rigorous bibliographical investigations as did the literature of the hand-press period. In 1962, with remarkable promptness, the first volume of the Hawthorne edition appeared, containing The Scarlet Letter , and this volume soon became the same kind of landmark for the editing of modern literature that the first volume of the Dekker edition was for the editing of Renaissance literature. In its editorial rationale and its presentation of apparatus, it set a pattern that strongly influenced the work of a whole generation of editors. The approach was essentially the same as that of the Dekker edition, but Bowers made a full new presentation of the case in a nineteen-page essay, "A Preface to the Text" (designed to be supplemented, as the general textual essay in the Dekker was, by separate textual introductions to individual works). At the beginning he stated that the text of the edition was "a critical unmodernized reconstruction"—a phrase with momentous implications, for it indicated that, even for nineteenth-century literature, the retention of authorial forms of spelling and punctuation was an issue and the production of a reliable text necessitated the critical activity of emendation (drawing readings from various documentary texts and from the editor's own mind). That the aim of the "reconstruction" was an authorially intended text became clear in a later restatement of the "purpose" of the edition: "to establish the text in as close a form, in all details, to Hawthorne's final intentions as the preserved documents of each separate work permit"—by "synthesizing the evidence of all manuscripts and authoritative printed editions" (pp. xxxv-xxxvi). According to this "Preface," after the documentary variants had been recorded and the relationship among the documents determined, the "editorial procedure"—in instances where a final manuscript does not survive—"follows the principles laid down by Sir Walter Greg" (p. xxxiii). In some cases, however, Hawthorne's final manuscripts do survive, and the principal difference between applying Greg's "Rationale" to Dekker and using it for Hawthorne lies in determining how to treat those manuscripts, since Greg had addressed himself to situations in which the only authoritative texts were printed. Because Greg's choice of a first or early edition as copy-text was based on its proximity to a final manuscript and because one class of emendations to such a copy-text was meant to eliminate printing-house alterations of manuscript readings, Bowers reasoned that when a final manuscript survives it should be the copy-text. Although Hawthorne in some sense accepted (or expected) printers' or publishers' alterations, he did not, in Bowers's view, actively authorize them, and they sometimes had a "cumulative effect on Hawthorne's own modes of expression" that was "very serious indeed." Thus "the printing-house style imposed on the authoritative manuscript has been rejected" (p. xxxiv). This decision was a perfectly logical extension of Greg's line of reasoning, and it was accepted by many editors that followed. But it also became one of the most controversial decisions Bowers ever made, for not everyone agreed that Greg's line of reasoning was the most desirable one, and opposition to it gradually developed from two positions: that authors did "intend" the changes they authorized others to make (sometimes tacitly), and that uninfluenced authorial intention is less important than the combined intentions of all those responsible for bringing a work to the public. These positions deserve respect as alternative approaches, and they certainly merited more discussion than they had received at the time Bowers wrote, but they do not invalidate Bowers's reasoning: he was carrying to its logical conclusion an interest in literary works as the products of individual creative minds. The other most influential aspect of the Hawthorne edition was its treatment of apparatus. Just as the Dekker edition set a new style in apparatus for Renaissance drama, so the Hawthorne edition provided a model (adapted from the Dekker) in a field that had no established tradition. The annotation, as in the Dekker, was limited to textual matters, but—unlike the Dekker—the pages of text were kept free of all annotation. At the back of the volume there were—in addition to discursive textual notes—four kinds of lists: variants within and between the first and second editions, editorial emendations to the copy-text, substantive variants in the collated editions ("historical collation"), and line-end word-division. The first of these was of course not always necessary (and when a manuscript existed, another list was needed to record revisions present in it); but the other three lists were standard for succeeding volumes of the Hawthorne edition and (with minor variations in conception and form) for many later editions, edited both by Bowers and by others. The section on word-division was a notable innovation, addressing a textual problem that had apparently never been thought about before, given the lack of serious attention formerly paid to the editing of prose. Line-end hyphens in some words pose a problem for editors, who must decide whether to retain them, and readers of the new text in a scholarly edition similarly need to know whether to retain certain hyphens in making quotations; the word-division lists were Bowers's response to these previously unasked (but obviously logical) questions. Furthermore, his concern for recording editorial decisions about hyphens followed from a cardinal rule of his (expressed emphatically in the "Preface"): that, except for features of the layout and design of the copy-text document, all editorial departures from the copy-text must be reported, so that "the interested reader at any point can reconstruct the copy-text" (p. xxxviii). In the same year as his edition of The Scarlet Letter , Bowers generalized on his experiences thus far in editing Hawthorne for a paper he delivered at the South Atlantic Modern Language Association meeting (22 November 1962). Entitled "Some Principles for Scholarly Editions of Nineteenth-Century American Authors," it made the same points as the Hawthorne preface, arguing the applicability of Greg's approach to a period in which books were routinely plated (and from which authors' manuscripts frequently survive) and advocating the kind of apparatus he was using in the Hawthorne edition, separating the listing of emendations from the historical record of variants. It was clearly a call to action, asking scholars of American literature to "bring to their task the careful effort that has been established as necessary for English Renaissance texts." Because of this paper, Bowers is properly to be regarded as the architect of the great coordinated effort to edit American literature that soon followed. But before this paper was published (in Studies in Bibliography in early 1964, causing the Times Literary Supplement on 14 May to recognize that Bowers's "conclusions apply equally to English authors"), another basic essay of his, one that was given far greater exposure, appeared. James Thorpe had asked Bowers to write an introductory exposition of textual criticism for a pamphlet commissioned by the MLA on The Aims and Methods of Scholarship in Modern Languages and Literatures ; this pamphlet came out in 1963, and Bowers's essay thus became the most accessible and comprehensive statement of the applicability of Greg's "Rationale" to all periods of modern English, with examples drawn from Shakespeare, Dekker, Dryden, Fielding, Sheridan, Shelley, Hawthorne, Whitman, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Sinclair Lewis, among others. By 1970 (when a revised edition of the pamphlet was published, including Bowers's expansion of his essay to incorporate examples from Stephen Crane), there were 30,000 copies of the pamphlet in print, and 15,000 more of the second edition were sold; Bowers's ideas on editing undoubtedly reached their largest audience through this essay. Two of its phrases, indeed, became bywords in the ensuing editorial debates: "inferential authorial fair copy," a compact way of stating what text, in Bowers's view, the critical editor was striving to reconstruct; and "all his [the editor's] textual cards on the table—face up" (the final words of the essay), an attempt to emphasize the importance of a comprehensive apparatus. It was also in 1963 (following two Conferences on Editions of American Authors in June and October 1962) that the MLA set up the Center for Editions of American Authors (CEAA) as a standing committee (directed by William M. Gibson) to coordinate the various editorial projects then being formed; its functions were primarily to establish editorial standards for participating editions and (after 1966) to allocate National Endowment funds. Its editorial standards, as published in a Statement of Editorial Principles (1967), were the ones Bowers had already outlined; and this Statement , with the subtitle A Working Manual for Editing Nineteenth-Century American Texts , became another means by which Bowers's extension of Greg's ideas was given wide circulation. A great burgeoning of American editorial activity followed: by 1972, when a revision of the Statement appeared, fourteen editorial projects were involved and seventy-five volumes had been published (and over the ensuing two decades the number of projects doubled and the total number of volumes more than tripled). Bowers was never a member of the CEAA committee (or its successor, the Committee on Scholarly Editions), but his approach was the acknowledged foundation of the whole enterprise, and his advice played a role in the operation of the CEAA, especially during Matthew Bruccoli's directorship (1969-76). As Bowers's work on successive volumes of the Hawthorne edition progressed, he gave increasing amounts of time to several other editorial projects that he had taken on. The most limited was a 1963 paperback edition of The Merry Wives of Windsor for Alfred Harbage's Pelican Shakespeare series (it was gathered six years later into the one-volume Penguin Complete Works ). This was the only edition of Shakespeare Bowers ever published—though a decade later he made substantial progress on the texts of I Henry IV and All's Well That Ends Well for a projected South Carolina edition (and at the end of his life he was in correspondence with Cambridge University Press about undertaking Othello for a series devoted to the Shakespeare quartos). The Pelican Merry Wives presented (by the dictates of the series) a modernized text and a three-page introductory essay not concerned with textual matters (which A. L. Rowse, in a letter to Bowers in August 1982, called "the best thing written about it"); but Bowers did include an appendix discussing the quarto and folio texts, with a list of his departures from the folio. For Cambridge University Press he was serving as general editor of The Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon , a series of volumes he had proposed in 1960, with individual plays assigned to separate editors—Bowers himself (he edited at least one play in every volume), L. A. Beaurline, and four of Bowers's former students who had written relevant dissertations in the 1950s, Irby B. Cauthen, Jr., Cyrus Hoy, Robert K. Turner, Jr., and George Walton Williams. (Later Hans Walter Gabler was added to the list of editors.) Each play was handled "according to editorial procedures set by the general editor and under his close supervision in matters of substance as well as of detail," in the words of the foreword to the first volume, which was completed at the beginning of 1965 and appeared in 1966. Bowers's sixteen-page general textual introduction held no novelties for anyone accustomed to his style of edition: it provided a clear statement of what editing in accord with Greg's "Rationale" meant and described an apparatus like the Dekker, with substantive emendations in footnotes and the rest of the textual record at the end. (A difference from the Dekker, however, was the silent modernization of the Elizabethan use of i , u , and v. ) The assiduity of the search for press variants was suggested by Bowers's assertion that collation of quarto copy-texts included "all copies in the great libraries of Great Britain and the United States." Whereas the Beaumont-Fletcher was an ongoing project, which in fact extended to the end of Bowers's life, another editorial undertaking of the mid-1960s, a two-volume selection of Dryden's plays edited in collaboration with L. A. Beaurline, was completed for 1967 publication. These volumes, John Dryden: Four Tragedies and John Dryden: Four Comedies , were published by the University of Chicago Press as part of the "Curtain Playwrights" series, established by Bowers and R. C. Bald to make available, in convenient format, selected works by English dramatists before 1700. Each volume contained a single-page explanation of textual policy, referring the reader to the Beaumont-Fletcher edition for fuller discussion; the texts of this self-styled "reading edition" were established with the same thoroughness as those of Beaumont and Fletcher, but the simplicity of the textual histories (except for The Indian Emperour ) led to the decision to limit the apparatus to emendations and stop-press variants. The editorial problem for The Indian Emperour was whether to choose the 1665 Trinity manuscript (not in Dryden's hand) or the first quarto of 1667 as the copy-text. Bowers chose the manuscript on the grounds that it preserved more of the archaic spellings present in the surviving early holograph letters of Dryden, features that were modernized by the compositors of the 1667 edition. The play had just appeared (1966) in the California edition of Dryden's works, where Vinton Dearing (who believed in the same editorial goals as Bowers) had chosen the quarto as copy-text; Phillip Harth, in a remarkable review in Modern Philology (1970), concluded (on the basis of his independent investigation of the evidence) that Bowers's choice was the proper one to retain as many of Dryden's own spellings as possible. Bowers was naturally pleased by Harth's conclusion, but he must also have taken satisfaction in Harth's notice of his long attention to Dryden, going back to a 1949 article on variants in the plays and the historic 1950 article on copy-text: Harth pointed out that "Bowers has become a unique authority on the textual aspects of Dryden's plays" and that the Chicago edition "offers a fitting climax to these studies." Still another editorial project with which Bowers had become associated by the mid-1960s was The Wesleyan Edition of the Works of Henry Fielding under the executive editorship of W. B. Coley—a particularly pleasant undertaking for him because it allowed him to work with his Virginia colleague and good friend Martin C. Battestin. He agreed to serve as General Textual Editor, setting up the textual policy and writing textual introductions and bibliographical descriptions. (In this edition, there was to be only one textual essay in each volume, combining an exposition of the general textual principles with an account of the textual histories of the works in the volume.) The Fielding edition had individual volume editors, and Bowers accepted the additional task of editing the text for the Tom Jones volumes. The first volume of the series, Battestin's edition of Joseph Andrews , came out in 1967, and in 1972 Henry Knight Miller's edition of the first volume of Miscellanies was published, both with Bowers's textual introductions, representing his first detailed consideration of the editing of eighteenth-century texts. His own edition of Tom Jones (completed in 1971) appeared in 1974 in two volumes, with a historical introduction and commentary by Battestin; Coley's edition of The Jacobite's Journal and Related Writings was also published in 1974, and Battestin's Amelia and Malvin R. Zirker's An Enquiry into the Late Increase of Robbers followed in 1983 and 1988, all three volumes again containing Bowers's textual essays. In the Tom Jones volumes, Bowers's textual introduction provided a notable example of the place of bibliographical analysis in determining textual history. Whereas earlier editors had relied on the text of the third or fourth edition, Bowers showed that the striking variants in the third edition were limited to one bibliographical unit and that Fielding's revisions in the fourth edition were mixed with unauthoritative readings repeated from the third. In this situation, he said, "Greg's classic theory of copy-text must hold" (p. lxx), with the first edition carrying the authority for punctuation and spelling and the fourth providing many authoritative emendations of wording. Bowers firmly rejected the idea that, in marking up the third edition for the printer, Fielding sanctioned any third-edition readings not explicitly revised: "The day has long since passed when anyone could seriously argue that these had been 'approved' by Fielding since he failed to alter them back to the first-edition readings" (p. lxxi). (Although Bowers's position is entirely logical, given his concept of authorial intention, the day is by no means "passed" when the contrary argument may be heard.) Bowers's now famous handling of Fielding's revisions in the Man-of-the-Hill section (rejecting what were thought to be third-edition revisions not carried into the fourth) rested not only on bibliographical evidence but also on a large element of critical judgment—which Bowers, as always, was eager to acknowledge. Separating the authorial from the non-authorial readings of the fourth edition, he said, "is a critical process almost exclusively in which the editor shoulders his proper responsibility" (p. lxxi). Shortly after the publication of Bowers's edition, Hugh Amory disclosed evidence, found in a Harvard copy of the first edition of Tom Jones , leading to the conclusion that the Man-of-the-Hill story had been revised during the printing of the first edition and that the text of it in the third edition was actually the original (canceled) version (see Harvard Library Bulletin , 1977). Although this inference results in a textual history at variance with the one drawn by Bowers (who took Amory's findings into account in the 1977 paperback reprint of his edition and the 1985 Modern Library reprint), Amory acknowledged that Bowers "has settled the bulk of the edifice." Bowers's textual essay on Tom Jones remains a fascinating demonstration of his mastery in handling complicated textual situations. While involved with work on all these editions, Bowers was generous of his time in encouraging and advising other editors. The most important instance of his direct role in an edition for which he did not edit any individual texts is his association with the John Dewey edition. In June 1965 Jo Ann Boydston, who was to become director of the Center for Dewey Studies at Southern Illinois University, asked Bowers for assistance in formulating an editorial rationale for a complete edition of Dewey's writings. Since 1961 she had been assembling the materials for editing and studying Dewey's life and works, and by 1965 she had decided that any serious editing of Dewey's texts should be conducted in conformity with the new textual approaches to American literature then receiving considerable publicity. ("I had had an almost mystical, not to say religious, experience upon first reading Bowers [in the MLA pamphlet]," she said in a 1984 article in Scholarly Publishing .) Bowers readily agreed to visit Carbondale (characteristically adding that there would be time for him to give a Shakespeare lecture, if one were desired), soon accepted the position of Consulting Textual Editor for the edition, and in April 1966 wrote a ten-page essay, "Textual Principles and Procedures," for inclusion in the published volumes. Bowers and Boydston worked well together, and their collaboration is important in editorial history in two ways: it marked the entry of Greg-Bowers editing into the field of twentieth-century writings, and it also resulted in the first application of this approach to the work of a philosopher (as Boydston noted in her preface to the 1967 volume, Psychology , which was designated Volume 2 of the series but was the first to appear). What Bowers's consultative role entailed, after the initial planning, was described in a letter he wrote to the editor of the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America in 1974: "Occasionally she may consult me about the import of the evidence for complex textual transmission and the effect of the transmission on the choice of copy-text and its treatment, and I am likely to read over her textual introductions and notes to see if I have any suggestions about the presentation of the problems treated there." (Boydston herself believes that Bowers understated his contribution here.) Bowers's textual essay for the Dewey edition was a cogent explanation of critical editing and its relevance to twentieth-century texts, and it was addressed (rightly) to an audience unfamiliar with bibliographical analysis, as this passage shows: This full stemma . . . of the total number of editions and impressions of any Dewey work, and their order, establishes the necessary physical base for proceeding to the investigation of the complete body of evidence about textual variation and its order of development, a matter that has a crucial bearing upon the determination of the authority of the variants in any given edition or impression. (p. xi) The preference for manuscripts over printed editions as copy-texts, argued in the Hawthorne edition, was set forth with particular emphasis here: every author whether consciously or unconsciously, and often whether consistently or inconsistently, does use the forms of the accidentals of his text as a method for conveying meaning. . . . the author's accidentals . . . have a superior authority in manuscripts from that in the printed form that has undergone the ministrations of copyreaders and compositors. (pp. xii-xiii) By addressing the text of Dewey in the same way he had approached the texts of literary figures from earlier centuries, Bowers was publicizing an important point (one that Boydston obviously had in mind in seeking Bowers's help): that all verbal works, whether "literary" or not, require the same kind of textual investigation if readers are interested in having texts as intended by their authors. The association with Boydston afforded Bowers great satisfaction: as he wrote her on 29 March 1985, "It has always given me pleasure that we have had such a happy relationship, always with a meeting of minds." By the end of the 1960s, with the Hawthorne and the Beaumont-Fletcher series still in progress, Bowers had embarked on a third multivolume edition, The University of Virginia Edition of the Works of Stephen Crane , two volumes of which reached publication in 1969. What constituted a "Bowers edition" was well known in textual circles by this time, and the nineteen-page essay on "The Text of the Virginia Edition" in the first volume ( Bowery Tales ) carried no real surprises (with many passages, indeed, repeated verbatim from the Hawthorne textual essay)—though a few more unreported alterations were allowed here. One point of considerable theoretical interest did emerge in the essay, but it was mentioned so unobtrusively that most readers probably did not recognize its importance. At the end of a paragraph, Bowers stated that "an editor may be bolder in experimental mixing of the accidentals in two substantive texts when they radiate from a lost archetype than when, as in a revised edition, one derives from another" (p. xvi). Then, near the end of a long footnote to this sentence, he observed, "Radiation is also found in various newspaper articles and sketches that would have been set by various compositors from proof copy furnished by Crane's syndicate employer." Bowers had to give further thought to this matter when he came to concentrate on Crane's stories and reports that were syndicated in newspapers. He recognized that, in the absence of the master proof sent out by the syndicate office, no one of the newspaper appearances carried more authority than the others, since all of them "radiated" from the lost proof and stood in the same relation to it. The editor therefore could do nothing but conflate the radiating versions (generally adopting the variants that appear in the largest number of witnesses), in an attempt to reconstruct the text of the lost proof. Since in this procedure no one of the surviving texts would be serving as a "copy-text" in Greg's sense, Bowers's thinking on the matter offered a supplement to Greg's "Rationale," covering a situation that Greg did not deal with. Bowers explored the subject in a brief paper at the December 1971 MLA convention in Chicago and expanded his treatment greatly for publication in The Library the following June as "Multiple Authority: New Problems and Concepts of Copy-Text" (having in the meantime read a shortened version of the final paper before the Bibliographical Society in London on 18 April). This magisterial essay—which examined the concept of "copy-text" in detail and explained why "Greg's linear-derived rationale" was "inappropriate" for instances of "immediate and equidistant" radiation—is one of the half-dozen most important essays of Bowers's last thirty years. Although Bowers was the person responsible for the influence of Greg's "Rationale," he was not hesitant to expose areas that Greg had not considered. In the 1970s Bowers added three more editions to the already burdensome roster of his projects (in addition to a 1973 two-volume facsimile edition—the first facsimile to receive a CEAA seal of approval—of the manuscript of The Red Badge of Courage , with a fifty-page analytical essay and extensive apparatus, for the Bruccoli Clark imprint of NCR/Microcard Editions). The first was The Complete Works of Christopher Marlowe in two volumes (1973) for Cambridge University Press (the publisher of the Dekker and the Beaumont-Fletcher as well). A four-page preface to the Marlowe (dated 15 July 1971) replaced the usual introductory essay on textual principles because the "editing of critical old-spelling Elizabethan texts seems to have been sufficiently codified as not to require here an extended description." It was "codified," of course, by Bowers himself, and the "concerned reader" was referred to the textual introduction in the Beaumont-Fletcher edition. Tackling Marlowe took Bowers into territory already explored by Greg, for one of Greg's major books was his parallel-text edition of Doctor Faustus (which Bowers, in a 1952 review in Modern Philology , called a "really unique scholarly achievement," emerging from a task that "could have been undertaken so successfully by no other living scholar"). Bowers stated that the "one novelty" in his own edition was his investigation of the "notorious problem of Doctor Faustus ." In an article ( SB , 1973) published just before the edition came out, as well as in the edition itself, Bowers effectively questioned Greg's argument that the additional passages in the 1616 text (those not in the 1604) reflected Marlowe's original manuscript rather than the extra stage material paid for by Henslowe. Yet in the end Bowers accepted as a fact Greg's idea that the 1604 was a "memorial reconstruction," and he therefore, though with some reluctance, followed Greg in using the 1616 as copy-text—a decision now generally regarded as unwise. (At the end of the decade Bowers revised the Marlowe for 1981 publication, recollating all copy-texts, reconsidering all emendations and potential emendations, and augmenting the historical record, but not switching copy-texts.) The second new edition Bowers embarked on in the 1970s was The Works of William James (on which his concentrated work began in January 1974). As the first unit in the American Council of Learned Societies' long-term plan to sponsor editions of major American philosophers, the edition was organized by Frederick H. Burkhardt, the general editor, for publication by Harvard University Press, with support for editorial costs from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Bowers had sole responsibility for establishing the texts of all James's writings (except the letters, for which he was "Consulting Textual Editor") and for seeing them through the press, an enormous task that eventually resulted in the publication of nineteen volumes (the largest of all Bowers's editions, with the most extensive textual apparatus, and the edition that he believed represented his best work). His general textual essay for the James, "A Note on Editorial Method," as it appeared in the first volume, Pragmatism (1975), was relatively brief (seven pages), but it contained two points of particular interest. The first was its discussion of copy-text. For those writings of James that appeared first in periodicals and were then collected in book form, James often allowed the magazine editors' styling of punctuation to stand for initial publication but was "more seriously concerned with the forms of certain of his accidentals" when marking magazine sheets and galleys for book publication. In such instances, Bowers suggested, the book texts contain the more authoritative punctuation and should be chosen as copy-texts, even though they are two steps removed from the manuscripts. The usual statement of preference for the text closest to a missing manuscript is here replaced with the explanation that the choice of copy-text "will vary according to the circumstances of 'accidental' authority as superior either in the early or in the late and revised forms of the text" (p. 180). Despite what some people believe, this approach does not contradict Greg, who never claimed that a first edition should be selected as copy-text when there is evidence of an author's careful attention to the accidentals of a later edition; more important, Bowers's handling of the James texts showed his flexibility and openmindedness in meeting new situations and his readiness to modify a long-standing procedure under differing circumstances. Another innovation in the James edition was the manner of recording manuscript alterations. Because James's numerous manuscripts generally contain extensive revisions, Bowers felt the need to construct a concise system for recording the intricacies of these revisions. In the textual essay he said only that "special provision" had been made "for the analysis and description of every variant between the initial inscription and the final revision within each manuscript"; but in the headnote to the list of manuscript alterations he outlined his system, and he explained it fully in one of his major late essays, a fifty-page article published in the 1976 Studies , "Transcription of Manuscripts: The Record of Variants." One may lament the substitution of the complexities of this system for the simple straightforward approach used in the Hawthorne edition; but Bowers's mind delighted in working out schemes for recording data (as in the Principles ), and a number of editors have since found the system helpful. The wealth of material preserving James's revisions—which gave rise to the development of this system in the first place—was emphasized at the end of Bowers's essay. Of "equal ultimate importance" with the established text, he believed, were "the apparatuses and appendixes devoted to the facts about the progress of James's thought from its earliest known beginnings to final publication in journal and book, and continuing to annotation in his private copies"—"this living historical record of the development of James's philosophical ideas and their expression" (pp. 182-183). (This point was repeated emphatically in a lecture on "Editing a Philosopher: The Works of William James" given by Bowers at the University of South Carolina on 25 October 1978 and at Northern Illinois University on 19 March 1979 and then expanded into an article for Analytical &amp; Enumerative Bibliography in 1980.) Bowers was struck by the copiousness of the genetic record, which he had not encountered in his work on other editions, and he knew that most readers (including professional scholars) were unaccustomed to extracting a "living" story from apparatuses. The final multi-volume edition that Bowers undertook was of the lectures of Vladimir Nabokov. This opportunity came his way through Matthew Bruccoli, who proposed the edition to Bowers in 1978 and planned to publish the lectures under the Bruccoli Clark imprint of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. With this project, Bowers was given a new editorial challenge: to fashion smooth reading texts out of lecture notes existing "in very different states of preparation and polish, and even of completed structure"—as he put it in the foreword to Lectures on Literature , published in 1980. Bowers felt that "it would be impractical to offer these manuscripts to the reading public in verbatim form," and his approach was to incorporate any disconnected comments (including those from the margins of the books Nabokov used as teaching copies) at appropriate places, creating bridging phrases where necessary but reproducing Nabokov's own wording "with fidelity." Although Bowers could exercise a creative freedom here that he would not have considered appropriate in his other editions, he no doubt saw the task as similar to the others in an important way: he was still in the position of judging how far to alter the documentary record in an attempt to produce a text that better reflected the writer's intentions. His respect for Nabokov was evident throughout his comments, and he was under no illusion that his text represented "what would have been Nabokov's language and syntax if he had himself worked them up in book form"; but it was, he could be sure, closer to what Nabokov said in class than a literal transcription of the notes. Two more volumes came out in quick succession (belying the difficulty of the task), Lectures on Russian Literature in 1981 and Lectures on Don Quixote in 1983. (The Nabokov editions have since been translated into French, Italian, Spanish, and German.) During the rest of the 1980s Bowers took on no new editions (except, with his wife, an edition of the transcripts of their friend Leon Kroll's oral memoir, recorded in 1956-57 by the Columbia University Oral History Research Office), though he did assist Matthew J. Bruccoli in working out a detailed editorial plan for the Cambridge University Press edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald (and was named as "Textual Consultant" on the title page when the first volume, The Great Gatsby , appeared in 1991). What he concentrated on in the late 1980s was finishing the James and Beaumont-Fletcher editions. The James, indeed, had been his primary ongoing project since the mid-1970s, for he had published the last of his ten Hawthorne volumes in 1974 (he was not involved in the notebooks and letters) and the last of the ten Crane volumes in 1976. Once the James was completed, the Beaumont-Fletcher was his only unfinished editorial project; he had seen two volumes through the press in 1985 and 1989, and in his final years he completed most of his work for the three remaining volumes (the first of which appeared a year after his death). His phenomenal production of editions resulted in a total of sixty volumes between 1960 and his death (not counting revised reprints or the two 1987 anthologies he edited—on Elizabethan and Jacobean-Caroline drama—for the Dictionary of Literary Biography ), with at least one volume appearing every year from 1961 through 1989: 1961 Dekker 4 [i.e., volume 4] 1962 Hawthorne 1 1963 Pelican Merry Wives of Windsor 1964 Hawthorne 3 1965 Hawthorne 2 1966 Beaumont-Fletcher 1 1967 Dryden (2 vols.) 1968 Hawthorne 4 1969 Crane 1, 7 1970 Beaumont-Fletcher 2; Crane 5, 6; Hawthorne 5 1971 Crane 4, 9 1972 Hawthorne 6, 7 1973 Crane 8; Crane facsimile (2 vols.); Marlowe (2 vols.) 1974 Fielding, Tom Jones (2 vols.); Hawthorne 9, 10, 11 1975 Crane 2, 10; James [1], [2] 1976 Beaumont-Fletcher 3; Crane 3; James [3] 1977 James [4] 1978 James [5] 1979 Beaumont-Fletcher 4; James [6], [7] 1980 Nabokov [1] 1981 James [8] (3 vols.); Nabokov [2] 1982 Beaumont-Fletcher 5; James [9] 1983 James [10], [11]; Kroll; Nabokov [3] 1984 James [12] 1985 Beaumont-Fletcher 6; James [13] 1986 James [14] 1987 James [15] 1988 James [16], [17] 1989 Beaumont-Fletcher 7 Anyone who understands how time-consuming the procedures of scholarly editing are will find this record amazing—and all the more so in view of the other activities in which Bowers was simultaneously engaged, especially in the 1960s. His energy and intelligence repeatedly produced path-breaking editions, illustrating the imaginative handling of a great variety of textual situations and leaving their mark on the future study of authors from five centuries. The story of the reception of Bowers's editions is a fascinating index of the shifting issues that confronted editors—and, indeed, all literary scholars—in the last thirty years of Bowers's life. His voluminous and steady output of editions during this time meant that he was always being reviewed, both in popular and in scholarly journals. Furthermore, other scholars in greater numbers were producing editions as well: it was an age of editing, shaped in many ways by Bowers's own activities. Because his presence was so strongly felt, any review of any edition might well refer to "the Bowers school" or "the Bowers type of edition" even if it did not engage in some discussion of the merits or demerits of Bowers's approach. Practically everything that has been written since 1960 about the scholarly editing of writings in English (and more recently about writings in other modern languages) has commented in one way or another on Bowers's work. Whether or not he is explicitly mentioned, his principles or the results of his influence are inevitably a significant part of the subject. Bowers's editions and the position they represent have been accorded a great deal of praise, and a great deal of criticism as well. They have been controversial, at first because they were innovative and later because—such was the growth of his stature—they seemed traditional. Some of the praise his editions have received has in fact been meaningless, for many reviewers of editions—even in academic journals—do not know how to evaluate editorial scholarship; and after commenting on the literary work that has been edited, they may add a sentence or two of perfunctory praise for the labor involved in what they regard, all too often, as a mechanical task. (Bowers wrote to David Vander Meulen on 12 November 1985, "When I was young I used to feel outrage myself at reviews that were praising but ignorant and missed the point of what I was trying to do.") Similarly, some of the criticisms of Bowers's approach cannot be taken seriously, for they spring from personal biases rather than from an open-minded engagement with the issues. The most famous instance is probably Edmund Wilson's article "The Fruits of the MLA," published in the New York Review of Books on 26 September and 10 October 1968 and then as a pamphlet. In the course of this incoherent attack on the whole CEAA enterprise, he focused briefly on Bowers: The great Demiurge behind all this editing seems to be Mr. Fredson Bowers of the University of Virginia. I am on friendly terms with Mr. Bowers, and I know that he is an impassioned bibliographer as well as an expert on Elizabethan texts, a field where it seems to me his attentions would have a better chance of proving valuable than in the checking of American ones. I have been told that his lectures on bibliography are so thrilling that young students often leave them with no other ambition than to become master bibliographers. But I have found no reason to believe that he is otherwise much interested in literature. It has been said, in fact, I believe, by someone in the academic world that, in editing Leaves of Grass , he has done everything for it but read it. (p. 17) Although nothing could be farther from the truth than the claim that Bowers did not have a love of literature, the main points to be made about Wilson's discussion are, first, that it gave no evidence of serious thought about the central issues of scholarly editing and, second, that it was clearly motivated by anger—over the decision of the National Endowment for the Humanities to favor the MLA editorial project rather than his own scheme for a series of American classics similar to the French Pléiade volumes. It is perhaps not surprising that Bowers's emphatic manner, coupled with the official sanction his position had received from the MLA, would automatically trigger some resistance. The very idea of an institutional committee (the CEAA) that inspected scholars' work and decided whether to award it an emblem of approval was anathema to some people, who as a result could not evaluate objectively the standards involved. They were likely to say that no one standard could be appropriate for all situations—without having examined Greg's rationale carefully enough to see that it was not a restrictive "standard" but a framework useful for thinking about textual problems. His rationale did assume that the goal of editing was the establishment of an authorially intended text; but for those who agreed with that goal, it did not place restrictions on individual judgment. A considerable number of reviews and articles, however, did raise serious issues (one of which was indeed whether authorial intention was an appropriate goal). They were not always coherently argued, but taken together they constituted an unprecedented outpouring of debate on the textual criticism of post-medieval literature. And Bowers's editing was always at the center of the discussion. On 29 December 1959 at the MLA convention in Chicago, Leo Kirschbaum issued an attack on "the Bowers school" that foreshadowed some prominent strands in the debates of the following decades. One of his charges was that Bowers and his followers treated plays as literature for reading, with "no sense of the theatre": "One would think that there had never existed a theatre in Virginia, that no one in Charlottesville had ever seen a play," and so on. A playwright's final manuscript, which Bowers aspired to reconstruct, did not, in Kirschbaum's view, represent a final intention, since the play had not at that point undergone the process of staging. "It is incumbent on a modern editor," he said, "to present a text in terms of the Elizabethan playhouse." (When Samuel Schoenbaum printed Kirschbaum's paper in the fifth number [1959-60] of Opportunities for Research in Renaissance Drama , Bowers wrote to him in protest, particularly of Kirschbaum's tone; but when Schoenbaum replied that his policy was to print the papers that had in fact been read at the MLA Renaissance Drama Conference Group meeting, Bowers immediately conceded the justice of Schoenbaum's position.) This particular point of Kirschbaum's was actually a questioning of the supremacy of uninfluenced authorial intention; in pointing out that what a playwright wrote "could not have been sacrosanct under the pressure of actual theatrical demands," he was saying that drama is unavoidably a collaborative effort and that the collaborative result is what we should be interested in. Although the intentions of authors as individuals had been the focus of textual criticism since antiquity, a growing doubt about the emphasis on individuals has been a mark of recent decades. Drama obviously raises the issue in acute form, but it has been raised in connection with all kinds of writing. Morse Peckham, for instance, in a 1971 essay in Proof entitled "Reflections on the Foundations of Modern Textual Editing," argued that it is "pure hagiolatry" to focus on authorial intention rather than on the passage of a text through an endless series of encounters with individuals. (Peckham appended a note to his essay, declaring that "Nothing in this paper should be construed as an attack on Professor Bowers. As a hagiolator myself, I have a tendency to canonize great scholars. . . . As a man of achievement and as a human being built on the grand scale, he is necessarily the object of the free-floating resentment which seems to be more prevalent in the academic world than elsewhere.") James Thorpe ( Principles of Textual Criticism , 1972) and Philip Gaskell ( From Writer to Reader , 1978), among others, tended to believe that authorially intended punctuation was in fact likely to be honored by choosing first editions (containing changes expected by authors) rather than manuscripts as copy-texts. By the 1980s a "social" approach to textual criticism, emphasizing the collaborative nature of the publication process and the influence of book design on readers, had become a prominent alternative to what was perceived as the Greg-Bowers orthodoxy of authorial intention. The leading statements of this position were Jerome J. McGann's A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism (1983) and D. F. McKenzie's Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts (1986), both of which—to use McGann's phrasing—conceived of "the process of literary production" as "far more socialized" than Bowers did. The specific application to drama—in a much more thoughtful way than Kirschbaum's—came in T. H. Howard-Hill's "Modern Textual Theories and the Editing of Plays" ( The Library , 1989); but his argument, like the others', suggested that a concern with uninfluenced authorial intention was wrong, rather than recognizing that it and the social approach were two alternative routes to the past that must always be with us. Another complaint of Kirschbaum's 1959 paper was what he perceived as Bowers's "Platonic bias," the view that "some place, somewhere, a substantive text has existed, exists, or will exist." This criticism was an attempt to deal with the fact that authors revise their works and that there may be distinct versions of their works embodying different "final" intentions. Greg and Bowers both understood that some acts of revision produce what are in effect new works, demanding separate treatment; but Bowers did not find, in the authors he edited, any instances of revision that precluded his focusing on a single final intention. The eclecticism involved in his constructing single intended texts from multiple documentary witnesses was criticized—often indirectly—from more than one point of view. The most basic was the belief that versions of works (including early drafts) deserved to be studied in their own right and that the proper emphasis for textual study was on development rather than stasis. A genetic school of textual criticism became prominent in France and Germany and was increasingly recognized in English-speaking countries through Bowers's openness to diverse points of view in his own journal, Studies in Bibliography (which published Hans Zeller in 1975 and Louis Hay, Klaus Hurlebusch, Gerhard Neumann, and Siegfried Scheibe in 1988). A related movement in English literary study was most prominently represented by a group of scholars who advocated the printing of discrete versions of certain Shakespearean plays (as in the 1983 anthology The Division of the Kingdoms , edited by Gary Taylor and Michael Warren). Although these various studies did not usually make Bowers a specific target, their general tendency was to cast doubt on approaches that elevated final authorial intention over the multiple intentions reflected in successive revisions. Textual evolution was approached in a different way by Hershel Parker, who had the notion that an examination of the creative process enabled one to locate authorial intention as it emerged from the heat of composition and to disqualify some chronologically "final" authorial revisions as being incoherent tamperings that postdated this period of organic revision. To his mind, the Greg-Bowers tradition neglected the creative process, and he believed that Bowers was guilty of many additional faults as well, enumerated in his book Flawed Texts and Verbal Icons (1984), which documented his persistent campaign, from 1974 on, to expose what he saw as the deficiencies of Bowers's editorial practice. (A measure of the strong feelings that Bowers aroused is offered by Morse Peckham's 1987 review of this book in Analytical &amp; Enumerative Bibliography : although Peckham dismissed Parker's main argument, he nevertheless was "vastly" entertained "to watch Hershel Parker blow that grand panjandrum, that imperial bow-wow, Fredson Bowers, right out of the water." Bowers used the occasion of this review to deny—in a letter published the next year—the implication that he "blackballed" Parker from the Committee on Scholarly Editions.) Parker's most detailed criticisms of Bowers were directed at the Crane edition. He considered the textual essay in the volume containing Maggie ( Bowery Tales ) "to be argued with bewilderingly specious pedantry," and he "found the editorial apparatus so badly conceived and error-ridden as to be quite unusable" (p. 148); he had even demanded (unsuccessfully) that the CEAA rescind the seal of approval awarded to the volume. His 1976 review (most of which he reprinted in his book) of the volume containing The Red Badge of Courage accused Bowers of a "misleading account of Crane's revisions," the "related decisions to emend the novel excessively," and "failures to consider the full range of textual and critical evidence" (pp. 153-154). (The evidence, in his view, led to the conclusion that Crane was forced by the publisher to alter the novel, and thus that Bowers should not have accepted so many of the first-edition readings.) Parker's student Henry Binder wrote an article entitled "The Red Badge of Courage Nobody Knows" for a special Crane issue (edited by Parker) of Studies in the Novel (1978) and produced a text, retaining manuscript readings whenever possible, for the first edition of The Norton Anthology of American Literature (1979), of which Parker was one of the editors; when Norton was about to bring out the Binder text as a separate edition three years later, Herbert Mitgang wrote a front-page article for the New York Times entitled " 'Red Badge' Is Due Out as Crane Wrote It" (2 April 1982). Despite this fanfare, the determination of Crane's "intention" remains a matter of critical judgment (and Binder's edition, in its turn, came in for criticism). Parker's comments were like those of many other reviewers of editions in seeming to regard errors of fact and errors of judgment as equally certain. David J. Nordloh, for example, in what is probably the harshest criticism that any of Bowers's editions has received (in the Crane number of Studies in the Novel ), first discussed inaccuracies in the Crane volumes and then tried to explain, as an equally definite matter, why the new texts were "muddles of editorial synthesis and intervention," combining "an insensitivity to what Crane was doing with an unwillingness to leave Crane as he was" (pp. 103-104). For Nordloh, the "introduction of imagination where evidence fails" (p. 115) was a fault; but of course critical editing, like other attempts to reconstruct the past, inevitably relies on informed creativity. The difficulty that many people have in coming to terms with this point is epitomized in Leon Howard's review of two of the Crane volumes in Nineteenth-Century Fiction (1970): he recognized that "aesthetic judgments" can be "desirable in editorial work," but he concluded (since to him Bowers's approach resulted in "a grossly 'eclectic' edition") that Bowers's text of Maggie "cannot be recommended for the use of serious students and critics." Donald Pizer was similarly unprepared to accept even "the best possible coalescing of the 1893 and 1896 editions" of Maggie as anything other than "a bibliographical curiosity" ( Modern Philology , 1970). Thomas L. McHaney took a more reasoned position (in American Literary Realism , 1971) when he explained why he personally would have preferred a "more conservative," less emended, text of Maggie but could still say that "one must lean in Bowers' direction even there, so persuasive are his arguments." Although the Crane edition, particularly Bowers's handling of Maggie and The Red Badge of Courage , stirred up more debate than any of Bowers's other editions, the Hawthorne edition came in for considerable criticism. As the first scholarly edition of its kind in American literature, it was frequently met with bewilderment and misunderstanding. For some people, Bowers's tone was an additional obstacle to a fair examination of the scholarship involved. Richard Harter Fogle devoted nearly half of his chapter on Hawthorne in American Literary Scholarship for 1965 to an explanation of his preference for Hyatt H. Waggoner's Riverside edition (1964) of The House of the Seven Gables over Bowers's Centenary edition—the faults of the latter including Bowers's apparent dismissal of the Waggoner edition in a footnote and his use of his "undoubted talents largely in praise of his own vocation of bibliography" (p. 26). And Roy R. Male, three years later in the same publication, objected to Bowers's The Marble Faun for "making Hawthorne merely an interesting case study for textual bibliographers"; he regarded the whole Centenary Edition as a monument that "pays tribute to Fredson Bowers, not to Hawthorne" (p. 21). But some serious and detailed discussions of real textual questions did appear, and the issue they repeatedly touched on was the regularization of spelling. Thomas L. McHaney felt that "the editors of Hawthorne's work have sought more consistency than is necessary" ( Studies in the Literary Imagination , 1969); John Freehafter concluded that Bowers's text of The Marble Faun contained "too many textual emendations" as a result of excessive normalization and "inattention to linguistic evidence" ( Studies in the Novel , 1970); and O M Brack, Jr., questioned Bowers's assumption, as a basis for emending Fanshawe , that the lost manuscript was "relatively consistent within itself" ( Proof , 1971). There is, indeed, good reason to question Bowers's judgment on this matter; but, since judgment is involved, it is hard to see how one can claim, as Freehafter does, that Bowers's own emendations in The Marble Faun are "usually incorrect." Commentary on the other editions was less agitated and even at times indifferent. The Beaumont-Fletcher, not unexpectedly, prompted reviewers to lament, as they had with the Dekker, the lack of explanatory annotation. Kenneth Muir, in Shakespeare Studies (1967), spoke for many when he said that "the same editors should provide the annotation, since no text can be established on bibliographical principles alone"—and he continued to wonder, in reviewing the next volume in 1974, whether one can edit a text "without being able to explain every line of it." Comments such as these, naïvely implying that Bowers and his co-editors did not take "meaning" into account, show how little scholarly editing is understood, even by some persons who have engaged in it. Clifford Leech was wiser, in his more thoughtful review ( University of Toronto Quarterly , 1967), to say simply, "We need a commentary." The Dryden edition, praised by Phillip Harth in the important review mentioned earlier, was questioned by O M Brack, Jr., in Philological Quarterly (1968) not only for what he surprisingly considered an "unusual procedure" in handling The Indian Emperour (taking accidentals from the 1665 manuscript and some of the substantives from an edition of 1670) but also for its preservation of "minutiae" in a readers' edition with simplified apparatus. Several distinguished reviewers of the Marlowe edition—Kenneth Muir in Journal of English and Germanic Philology (1974), Roma Gill in Review of English Studies (1974), and Mark Eccles in Modern Philology (1975)—noted numerous errors in it (as did correspondents to the Times Literary Supplement in April, May, and June 1974), but Muir and Eccles also found much to praise. Gill (whose 1965 edition of Faustus had anticipated Bowers's critical view of the 1616 text and whose 1989 edition was to use the 1604 as copytext) felt constrained to conclude, "Those of us who in the past have admired Mr. Bowers's work, in both the theory and the practice of textual criticism, can only be saddened by the present production." As for the Tom Jones edition, both Don L. Cook ( Review , 1979) and Peter Miles ( The Library , 1979), in sensible and balanced reviews, expressed admiration for Bowers's achievement but also pointed out a disconcerting number of errors in the apparatus. In contrast, the textual accomplishment of the James edition was rarely recognized by reviewers, because philosophers were not accustomed to textual study and often in fact were contemptuous of it. John Passmore, reviewing three volumes of the edition in the Times Literary Supplement (24 June 1977), claimed to see the value of lists of variants for literary study but did not regard them as important in "an edition for philosophers"—since philosophers "go to James because they are interested in, let us say, truth or meaning or experience" (which, one can only conclude, are unrelated in philosophers' minds to nuances of expression). Similarly Jeffrey Barnouw believed that the "overwhelming textual apparatus" might serve a purpose for "some few readers" ( Review of Metaphysics , 1981); and Carl P. Duncan, after noting the "massive amount of bibliographic detail and textual analysis," added (with a significant "but"), "But there are some things of interest to historians of psychology" ( American Journal of Psychology , 1982). One has to turn to The Library —where Peter H. Nidditch, editor of Locke, reviewed the first volume of the James—to find the textual work taken seriously. The Nabokov volumes, as one might expect, were reviewed widely, but (like the James) in journals where the editing was scarcely noticed. (As Bowers wrote to his oldest son on 20 November 1980, about a month after the first Nabokov volume had appeared, "The midwife gets no credit for the baby.") Of the hundreds of reviews Bowers's editions received, those dealing with the Hawthorne and Crane editions produced the liveliest controversy and engaged the most interesting issues. Their most incontestable, if unfortunate, contribution was the demonstration that these editions contained a substantial number of errors. But the reviewers revealed their own limitations when, after theoretically accepting the value of critical judgment in editing, they attacked as flawed those editions that embodied critical judgments not in accord with their own. Bowers was charged both with violating Greg's principles and with carrying them out too rigidly (Parker, for instance, made both charges [pp. 62, 66]); it was not easy for some reviewers to accept the multiplicity of results that Greg's emphasis on editorial judgment could lead to. Nevertheless, even some of Bowers's most severe critics could acknowledge the uniqueness of his attainment. Nordloh, before enumerating the "excruciating details" of his criticism, summarized the difficulties inherent in the editing of Crane and called Bowers "the only person with the skill, the powers of mind, the patience above all, to have attempted it alone" (p. 107). Many of the reviewers were not deferential to Bowers, nor would he have wished them to be; but the debates that swirled around his editions, even in instances when they revealed unquestionable flaws, were testimony to the comprehensive strength, imaginative daring, and critical intelligence of his editorial vision. During the last three decades of his life, Bowers produced, in addition to those sixty volumes of editions, nearly a hundred essays, lectures, and reviews. A dozen or so of the articles were of the utmost importance, ranking with the most significant of his earlier writings, and six or seven of the reviews will stand as classic examples of what long, detailed scholarly reviews can accomplish. All these essay-length pieces constitute a body of work that a scholar who had done nothing else could be proud of; when one considers his prodigious output of editions during the same years (to say nothing of his other activities), the record seems astounding. His concentration on bibliographical and textual investigations did not prevent him from writing essays of literary criticism on Renaissance drama and poetry, and some dozen and a half pieces—on Herbert, Vaughan, Milton, and particularly Shakespeare—appeared in these years. The bibliographical studies were frequently offshoots of his editorial work, some of them dealing with specific problems (in Crane's The O'Ruddy , Marlowe's Doctor Faustus , and Beaumont and Fletcher's Beggars Bush , for example), but most of them treating general issues, sometimes recapitulating for different audiences what he had said before and in a few instances offering important new observations. Among his most influential essays of this period (many of them originating as lectures) are several that have already been mentioned—his basic introduction to textual criticism for the MLA pamphlet (1963), his statement of the application of Greg's "Rationale" to the editing of American literature (1964), his essential supplement to Greg in the treatment of "Multiple Authority" (1972), and his exposition of a new system for recording manuscript alterations (1976). Of his other major general pieces, the three most remarkable ones are probably "Bibliography Revisited" (an address to the Bibliographical Society in London on 17 October 1967 as part of its seventy-fifth anniversary celebration, and published in The Library in 1969), which is Bowers's most significant supplement to his Principles of Bibliographical Description , concentrating on the issue of "degressive bibliography" (the practice of reducing the quantity of detail for certain entries); "Remarks on Eclectic Texts" (a paper read in abridged form at the Villa Serbelloni in September 1973, and published in Proof in 1975), which must be regarded as the classic explanation of the value of producing texts that bring together readings from different documentary witnesses; and "Greg's 'Rationale of Copy-Text' Revisited" ( SB , 1978), which is the most trenchant examination of Greg that has been written. The latter piece was a distinguished meditation on Greg's applicability to later periods, meaningfully (in view of Bowers's position as Greg's champion) expressing caution in making such application (Bowers himself called this essay, in a letter of 4 January 1984, "one of the most important articles I have tried to write about textual criticism"). Five other notable statements can perhaps be singled out. In 1966 his Zeitlin-VerBrugge and Howell Lecture at the University of California (both Los Angeles and Berkeley), "Bibliography and Modern Librarianship" (published as a pamphlet the same year), dealt with the implications of bibliographical scholarship for the practices (wittily criticized) of librarians. His Ohio State lecture, "Practical Texts and Definitive Editions," on 16 February 1968 (published in a pamphlet the next year with a lecture of Hinman's), celebrating the publication of The Marble Faun in the Centenary Edition, responded to critics of the Hawthorne edition and coined the term "practical edition" (for editions that rest on "information that may be procurable through normal scholarly channels and thus without more special research than is economically feasible"). A summation of his approach, "Scholarship and Editing," was delivered before the Bibliographical Society of America on 23 January 1976 (and published in the Society's Papers the same year). And a thorough reconsideration of historical records of variants ("The Historical Collation in an Old-Spelling Shakespeare Edition") and of the practice of regularization ("Regularization and Normalization in Modern Critical Texts") appeared in Studies in Bibliography in 1982 and 1989. Bowers wrote considerably fewer reviews in the thirty years after 1960 than he did in the fifteen years from the end of the war through 1960 (twelve as opposed to twenty-one—even the latter figure not being particularly large). He was not drawn to reviewing, even though he recognized (in both of his obituaries of Greg) that Greg's reviews had played an important role in the history of bibliographical scholarship. His attitude toward reviewing was stated unequivocally in a letter to David Vander Meulen on 12 November 1985: [I] realize all over again how impermanent reviewing really is. I won't say it is a waste of time, but it can be a waste of professional energy better devoted to more creative projects. If a book dies, the review dies with it. If the book remains, the review is ultimately (indeed, rather soon) forgotten. It is journeyman's work. His reviews, therefore, when he chose to write them, were special occasions; and at least six or seven of his dozen post-1960 reviews will not be "forgotten," for they are extended investigations of major works. They are, indeed, performances of the kind that practically no one else would have been capable of—and certainly no other single person could have written all of them, so great is their range of subjects. The earliest is one of his best-known writings, his unfavorable review ( Modern Philology , 1964) of the second volume of the Yale Johnson edition, which cogently objected to its policy of "partial modernization." (Five years earlier he had severely reviewed the first volume in the Journal of English and Germanic Philology , complaining about misleading transcription and silent alteration: "'We have supplied punctuation silently,' remark the editors and thereupon fall silent themselves. This is not at all a satisfactory statement of procedure.") He went on to deal at length with Kathleen Tillotson's edition of Oliver Twist (fourteen pages in Nineteenth-Century Fiction [1968], taking a critical look at her choice of copy-text and her policy of emendation); Arthur Golden's edition of Walt Whitman's Blue Book (five pages in the Journal of English and Germanic Philology [1969], constituting an important evaluation of the methods for recording manuscript alterations, looking forward to his long 1976 article); Philip Gaskell's A New Introduction to Bibliography (sixteen largely unfavorable pages in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America [1973], lamenting in particular Gaskell's distrust of analytical bibliography and criticizing his generalizations about Elizabethan printing); Peter Nidditch's edition of Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (eleven pages in The Library [1976], praising Nidditch for "true intellectual effort" in dealing with a situation in which there is "evidence for authorial control of the accidentals in a series of revised editions"); Philip Edwards and Colin Gibson's five-volume edition of Massinger (sixteen pages in the Yearbook of English Studies [1979], admiring the edition in general but regretting in it a "trend towards modernization of Elizabethan conventions with only doubtful benefit to modern clarity"); and Harold Jenkins's edition of Hamlet (fifteen pages in The Library [1983], examining in detail the bases for and the implications of Jenkins's elevation of the second quarto text). If reviews, except in unusual instances, seemed to him a waste of energy, he did not feel the same way about lectures. Besides his major essays that were delivered as addresses, he presented many other proficient pieces, always with flair, at a wide variety of locations, and most of them were later printed. His role as Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar in the 1962-63 academic year took him to Marietta College and Vanderbilt University, among other places, where one of his topics was Shakespeare; and he gave fourteen lectures during 1963-64 to commemorate the four-hundredth anniversary of Shakespeare's birth—participating in related events as well, such as a White House reception in June 1964 to honor the National Shakespeare Anniversary Committee. (The Vanderbilt lecture, "What Shakespeare Wrote"—published in the 1962 Shakespeare Jahrbuch —was praised by James G. McManaway in the 1965 Shakespeare Survey as "a fine introductory statement, one that will bear frequent reading.") The 1960s, indeed, were the period of his greatest activity as a lecturer, despite the heavy load of duties imposed by his departmental chairmanship. In early 1962, for example, he gave the Phi Beta Kappa Convocation address at Washington and Lee University (12 April, on Hamlet's fifth soliloquy); later that year, he spoke in the Sesquicentennial Series at Rice University (16 November, on point of view in Shakespeare), then at the South Atlantic Modern Language Association meeting (22 November, on editing American literature), and then at the MLA convention in Washington (28 December, on Hamlet ). Among the places he lectured (with different lectures) in the years that followed were Wayne State University (10 March 1964 in the President's Lecture Series, on Shakespeare's texts), the University of South Carolina (on 2 April 1965 at the Southeastern Renaissance Conference, on Henry IV ), the Clark Library (7 May 1966, sharing the platform with Lyle H. Wright at a Clark Library Seminar on "Bibliography and Restoration Drama," the papers from which were then published as a pamphlet), the University of Toronto (4 November 1966, in the second of its Conferences on Editorial Problems, on the textual implications of machine printing), and the University of Mississippi (27 November 1967, the Christopher Longest Lecture, on Paradise Lost ). In the 1970s his lecturing tapered off, especially after his retirement from Virginia in 1975 (although two prominent 1971 occasions he participated in were the World Shakespeare Congress in Vancouver in August and the Colloquium on Nineteenth-Century Canadian Bibliography in Toronto in November); but he was still enthusiastic about lecturing in the last years of his life, as his performances at the biennial conferences of the Society for Textual Scholarship show (in 1981, 1985, 1987, and 1989). Some of his lectures and publications dealt with professional matters (a tradition with him going back at least to his Randolph-Macon address of 1954 on scholarship and undergraduate teaching). One of his Phi Beta Kappa talks was entitled "The Academic Jungle" and was full of frank and practical advice to undergraduates on the realities of the world of graduate study. In the course of it, he touched on a subject that was a favorite of his in the 1960s, the inappropriateness of the Ph.D. program for training teachers. Here he called the Ph.D. system "a singularly foolish one," and in other pieces on this topic he became a staunch and outspoken advocate of a Doctor of Arts degree for those who intended to be primarily teachers, not publishing scholars. He outlined the rationale for this degree in College English (November 1965), asserting that the concept of the Ph.D. as a "union card" had caused training in research to be "inflicted as a whole on the thousands for whom it was not designed." (He made clear in the process, however, that he did not lament the passing of "the old philological days" and welcomed the recent substitution of "critical learning for the older historical method.") Such further titles as "The Business of Teaching" ( The Graduate Journal , 1961) and "On a Future for Graduate Studies" ( American Association of University Professors Bulletin , 1970) showed his continuing concern for the training of teachers in graduate school. (The latter piece, delivered at the Brown University Graduate School Convocation on 1 June 1970, received further circulation when it was excerpted in PMLA in October under the title "The Dilemma of Graduate Education.") His interest in the welfare of his profession was manifested in many other ways as well. For four years (1956-59) he was a Regional Chairman of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation; he served on the Executive Council of the MLA (1963-66), on the MLA's Committee on Research Activities (1955-60), New Variorum Shakespeare Committee (1955-82), Committee on Resolutions (1962), and English Program Advisory Committee (1966-68), and as the MLA delegate to the American Council of Learned Societies (1967-70); he was a member of the advisory boards of the Virginia Quarterly Review (1961-75)—the journal founded by his mentor James Southall Wilson—and the Shakespeare Quarterly (1954-72) and of the University Press of Virginia (1970-74); his term on the Executive Committee of the South Atlantic Modern Language Association (1967-71) included one year as vice president (1968) and one as president (1969); and he also held the presidencies of the Southeastern Renaissance Conference (1960) and the Society for Textual Scholarship (1985-87). The way such commitments made his schedule hectic is suggested by a letter he wrote to Gordon Ray on 30 November 1962: I was just about to leave for two weeks on SAMLA, Project English, and Phi Beta Kappa business. . . . I took all evening to do these [letters on behalf of Guggenheim applicants] instead of writing may last music column for printing when I am away, and getting my papers in order for voyaging. So I have been rushed. These varied activities and writings, along with his brilliantly attentive chairmanship of his department at Virginia, were enough to demonstrate not simply his good citizenship in the academic world but his deep sense of professional responsibility. By the time Bowers retired from his position at Virginia in the spring of 1975, having spent thirty-seven of his seventy years at the University, he had been—not surprisingly—the recipient of numerous honors and awards. His own university had recognized his achievements with two endowed chairs, first the Alumni Professorship of English (1957-68) and then the Linden Kent Memorial Professorship (1968-75), and with its highest honor, the Thomas Jefferson Award (1971). The citation for that award, calling him a "Jeffersonian gentleman," mentioned his knowledge of dogs, music, stamps, and wine as well as of literary scholarship, and it affirmed, "Mr. Jefferson, the extraordinarily versatile man in whose honor this award is made, would appreciate the versatility of Professor Bowers. Like Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Bowers masters thoroughly whatever interests him." Bowers's undergraduate university, Brown, had honored him with its Bicentennial Medal in 1964 and then with an honorary degree (Doctor of Letters) in 1970—the same year in which he also received a Doctor of Letters degree from Clark University. (He later —on 12 December 1983—wrote to his oldest son, "I have felt a peculiar obligation to Brown ever since I went there. . . . if Brown had not given me a scholarship . . . I'm not sure I could have gone to college.") His Gold Medal from the Bibliographical Society in London—the most important award in his field, which had been presented to only three Americans before—had come the previous spring (1969), and one more honorary degree, the Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Chicago, was presented to him in 1973. Among his research fellowships had been three national ones, a Fulbright in 1952-53 and two Guggenheim Fellowships, in 1958-59 and in 1970 (postponed to 1972); he had also been made a Research Scholar at the Rockefeller Foundation's Villa Serbelloni Research Center (1970, 1972), a Visiting Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford (1972, 1974), and a Fellow Commoner at Churchill College, Cambridge (1975). He had been elected to the American Antiquarian Society and the British Academy (as a Corresponding Fellow) in 1968 and to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1972. The bookish clubs he had been admitted to were the Grolier, the Codrington (All Souls), the Elizabethan (Yale), and the Tudor and Stuart (Johns Hopkins). His many admirers naturally regarded his retirement as an appropriate occasion for another honor, in the form of a banquet or a conference. But he made clear that he wished no such thing, though he indicated that he would enjoy small dinners in friends' houses (and those friends responded, sometimes with formal dinners, remembering the many black-tie evenings at Woodburn). One of the most touching occasions for Bowers occurred early in his final year at the university. On 26 October 1974 his former Virginia and Chicago students who had written their dissertations under his direction (or co-direction) gave a dinner in his honor. The menu-keepsake, printed at the university library "by C.S. &amp; K.S. for I.C." (Clinton Sisson and Kendon Stubbs for Irby Cauthen, on a Chandler &amp; Price treadle press given to the library by the Bibliographical Society), listed all the names, twenty-eight from Virginia and two from Chicago. At the time of this dinner there was an exhibition of Bowers memorabilia in the Rare Book Department of Alderman Library (on display for the month of October), and A Keepsake to Honor Fredson Bowers was published to accompany the exhibition. George Walton Williams's elegant introduction to it spoke on behalf of all of Bowers's students: In the display cases and in the illustrations of this booklet, the rich variety and fullness of Fred's accomplishments match his inexhaustible energy; if we have also intimated something of his good humor and his humanity, we shall have done our job well and may be found acceptable as sons of Fred. The booklet contained ten photographs and two reproductions of title pages: the photographs were of Bowers in 1906, 1910, ca. 1924, ca. 1940, 1971, and 1973, along with one of him judging a dog show (correctly dated 1954 but labeled "Long Island Kennel Club" instead of Irish Wolfhound Club of America Specialty Show at Amory L. Haskell's Woodland Farm, Red Bank, N.J.), one of him and his wife at Bread Loaf in 1960, one reproducing a drawing of Nancy Hale (ca. 1940) by her mother, and one showing her mother's 1946 oil portrait of Bowers in his naval uniform (a portrait that hung for several years in the living room at Woodburn, before it was given to Bowers's oldest son); the title pages were of The Dog Owner's Handbook and Principles of Bibliographical Description (the latter most unfortunately reproduced from the Russell &amp; Russell reprint of 1962). At this dinner the official announcement was made that the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia would be bringing out a collection of Bowers's essays. Late in 1975 a 550-page volume, containing twenty-six essays chosen by Bowers, was published, with an introduction by Irby B. Cauthen, Jr., expressing gratitude for Bowers's "service to the world of bibliography, a world that has felt—and will continue to feel—his creating and forming hand." Entitled Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing , the volume is one of the landmark books in the history of bibliography, bringing together many (but not all) of Bowers's most significant essays from 1941 through 1973, arranged in four sections, the first called "The Bibliographical Way" (six items) and the others dealing with descriptive bibliography (three items), analytical bibliography (six items), and textual criticism and editing (eleven items). Bowers did not revise the essays (a wise decision, since they were all historic documents that had been widely read and acted upon in their originally published form), but he did add a few comments in brackets and about two dozen new footnotes (some of considerable biographical interest). At the end of the volume were a check-list of Bowers's writings and a chronology of his career (based on his own records), which have been useful despite their occasional inconsistencies and inaccuracies. In reviewing this volume for Library Quarterly , G. Blakemore Evans stated, "No more fitting tribute than this volume could have been conceived for Bowers." Peter Davison, in Modern Language Review (1978), noted that Bowers's stature was such that reviewers took "glee" in pointing out errors in his work; but, Davison concluded, "picking holes in mountains does tend to leave them looking very much like mountains." Bowers's life in retirement continued for a while to be much the same as it had been before, except that he had more time for his research and writing (and more time for long trips, such as the one he and his wife took to Egypt in the spring of 1978, when she was working on a book about her great-uncle, who had been a diplomat there). Shortly before his retirement, when he sent Gordon Ray a report (23 September 1972) on his remarkably active second Guggenheim Fellowship, he had said, "I feel I am entering a period of real productivity, now that the dam has broken, and I am grateful to the Foundation for the opportunity to let loose a great deal of activity that had been penned up for lack of time." Five years later—two years into retirement—he wrote Ray again: Somehow I myself seem to have less time after retirement than before, but in only some part this may be due to my leading a somewhat more active outdoor life than before. Currently I am chainsawing trees and splitting locust logs for seasoning for next winter's wood. And getting good and lame in the process because I have never learned to pace myself but carry on up to the limit of endurance—which I trust is good for the cardiovascular system. In other respects I wish I were thirty years younger but knew what I now know, because in some respects I think I'm reaching my scholarly peak. (22 November 1977) His editions and essays kept appearing apace, and he attended conferences and gave lectures. After returning from the September 1978 conference at the University of Kansas that brought editors of literary and historical material together, he wrote me (on 31 October) as follows: The Kansas experience was better than I had anticipated and I was glad I went, in addition to the opportunity to talk to old friends like yourself. This was borne in upon me by my trip to South Carolina for two days the first of this past week, to give two lectures and gossip with students and faculty. I realized how much I am missing of such participation in my retirement state, even harried as I am by too many projects that need attention. The following spring (1979) the Bowerses were in Venice and London in April, with a few days at Oxford in May before returning on the 7th. "Although I'm glad to get away," he wrote on 3 April, "I shall miss the Virginia spring, which is just beginning, with cherry trees out, our orchard full of daffodils, and, unfortunately, the grass beginning to grow." (He always mowed the five-acre clearing around the house himself, using a Gravely twelve-horsepower, fifty-inch rotary mower that he had to walk behind.) A letter from London on 25 April closed with a paragraph that started in a characteristically lively fashion and ended on a touching note: An agreeable but small Colophon dinner tonight [the Colophon Club, the dining club of the Bibliographical Society's Council]. I wish they did not favor Bertorelli's! I have known that restaurant long and unfavorably for about fifty years now. In fact today is my 74th birthday. It is hard for me to grasp. His description (after he was back home, on 27 May) of some of his doings in London and Oxford can stand as an indication of what his trips had always been like, with attention paid to friends, music, theater, and food: Saw Stoppard's Night and Day, a most interesting play when it gathers momentum and a really imaginative Loves' Labours' Lost at the Aldwych. Three ballet evenings, and a Sadlers Wells Monteverdi Return of Ulysses by Kent Opera, firstclass singing. Four days in Oxford seeing old friends. Dined Frank and Kitty Francis and lunched with them in the country, with Robert Shackleton, and dined Robert later. Was lunched by Howard-Hill. Took John Carey's Shakespeare seminar at Merton and dined well afterward. And a letter a few months later (27 September) suggested that the pace of his life had not slackened: he was "pushing ahead full steam" on the Nabokov, "since the publisher would like it six months ahead of the original schedule," and he was to lecture at Kent in October and at Yale in December. The next spring (1980) everything changed, when his wife had a stroke. By late May she was thought to be recovering satisfactorily, but in early June she had a setback, followed by two operations to clear her carotid arteries. After more visits to the hospital, daily physical therapy, and constant attention from him, she regained considerable use of the left side of her body and was well enough by June 1982 for them to go to Folly Cove for the summer and to plan a trip abroad for the next spring. Bowers hoped to spend two months at Oxford, working through the Bodleian's newly acquired Harding Collection in order to amass further data for his Restoration drama bibliography—which, as he said in a letter of 16 March 1983, "has gathered dust for about twenty years but which I now want to revive and finish before I die." They did make the trip, living in Iffley Turn, Oxford, from 7 April to 7 June, during which time Bowers completed his work at the Bodleian and addressed both the Bibliographical Society (in London on 19 April) and the Oxford Bibliographical Society (in May). From then on, the Restoration bibliography was one of his primary concerns, vying with the Beaumont-Fletcher and James editions and with Studies for his time: I am trying to write up a play or so a day, though too often failing for lack of time. Moreover, the write-up of the description is the least part of my worries, for I must still try to work out publication in chronological order for arrangement like Greg, and write the series of notes that most plays will require. But I think I shall try to get the descriptions done and checked first and then groan later over the other labors. (23 November 1983) The process of looking at major collections that he had thus far not adequately examined meant that he needed to spend time at the Huntington Library. He was made a Research Fellow there for the month of May 1985, an arrangement that was repeated in the following two years. Thus the Bowerses added a new element to their annual routine, spending a month in California in May before going to Folly Cove. Along with his devoted care of his wife, Bowers continued to have an intense work schedule during these years, though he faithfully took a brief rest every afternoon (except at the Huntington, where—as he wrote on 14 May 1987—he worked "a seven-hour day without a mid-day nap"). Something of his old hectic pace is suggested by the events of late April 1985. On 20-23 April a conference was held in Charlottesville to celebrate Bowers's eightieth birthday; three days later (the day after his actual birthday) he flew to New York to deliver the Presidential Address ("Unfinished Business") at the conference of the Society for Textual Scholarship and to read another paper the next morning ("Mixed Texts and Multiple Authority"), returning home immediately after it in order not to be away from his wife longer than necessary; and on 1 May they flew together to Los Angeles for his work at the Huntington. The Charlottesville conference, which Bowers had agreed to only reluctantly, was organized by Hans Walter Gabler and David J. Nordloh and brought together twenty invited scholars for a series of discussions based on fifteen previously circulated papers. (At the opening session in the Rotunda, attended by both the Bowerses, I had the pleasure of conveying official greetings from the Bibliographical Society of America and of reading a paper attempting to characterize Bowers's achievement.) Bowers participated in all the discussions and was pleased, if exhausted, at the end. As he wrote me just afterward (24 April), "Usually I can snooze during meetings, but not those—too conspicuous, and in fact too interesting. . . . it was stimulating to me and being again in the midst of the clash of ideas which meant something was a very welcome change from the routine of my rather solitary existence." The appearance of some of the papers in SB reflects his continuing vigilance on behalf of the journal; but the papers most directly celebrating his accomplishments (David Vander Meulen's on the Principles and my opening statement) became the basis for a special commemorative number of the Bibliographical Society of America's Papers (Second Quarter 1985), published also as a separate pamphlet. (After this issue came out, Bowers wrote me —on 22 October 1985—that his "greatest pleasure" in it was "the vividness it has brought me of the positive need for me to put even greater effort into finishing the Restoration play bibliography while I am still able to poke a typewriter.") Various references in his letters show that his "solitary" life had many interruptions—visits to the Houghton Library from Folly Cove, to the University of Maryland to deliver a lecture that resulted in what he believed was his first standing ovation (late spring 1984), to McMaster University to advise the Bertrand Russell editors (October 1984), and so on. Two more honors came to him at this time: on 24 January 1986 the Bibliographical Society of America made him an Honorary Member, and on 26 September of that year the Association for Documentary Editing (meeting in Charlottesville) held a session on his influence and awarded him its triennial Julian P. Boyd Award. The continuous appearance of his editions during these years (two or three volumes in a year not being uncommon) is of course the best testimony to the efficiency of his rigorous schedule at home. Hints of that schedule surfaced in his letters: on 24 July 1984, for example, he wrote, "So far this summer I've been working on Beaumont and Fletcher for the vol after next, but today a mess of proof for the next vol. arrived that must have priority. Poor Wm James is being left in the lurch"; and on 8 February 1986, "I am as eager as I can be to get cracking again on that bibliography, but there has been no chance all winter. Just now I have assembled what I need to write the intro to my text of Henry VIII for the next B &amp; F vol., and then (except for some extra collation needed for Two Noble Kinsmen in the same vol.), I shall be free to try to tie up the next James volume on his mss." He was never without a heavy load; as he had written to his oldest son on 9 February 1982, "I have . . . taken on more than I should, but . . . I have a horror of not having enough to do." When Gordon Ray retired from the Guggenheim Foundation in 1985, Bowers said in a congratulatory note to him, "I'm sure you will stay as busy as I have. As W. W. Greg once remarked to me—'What else is there to do?'" Nothing better captures Bowers's energetic drive than this statement, especially since it implies his private measuring of himself against Greg. Nancy Hale's health declined further in 1987, partly because her physical therapy was interrupted for a cataract operation. In April 1988 she had another small stroke, which prevented their going to California in May but not to Folly Cove in late June (when she flew with a friend and he drove as usual). About two weeks after their return to Charlottesville, on 24 September 1988, she died, at the age of eighty, and Bowers's life was never the same again. His depression over losing her after forty-six and a half years was scarcely to be relieved in work, which he had previously been able to immerse himself in, regardless of other problems that were on his mind. Besides, his own health was cause for further depression. He had felt ill during the winter of 1987-88, and in June 1988 he had a benign polyp removed from his colon and was diagnosed as having a duodenal ulcer. Although the treatment for it was successful at first, he developed a more serious problem, inflammation of the pancreas, that summer at Folly Cove. By 28 November, however, he could report that the doctors had given him "a clean bill of health"; but ominously he added that he still felt "precarious and often somewhat ill." He was henceforth never to be without this feeling, in greater or lesser degree, and his last years can be summed up in his sentence, "I am partly ill, active, and unhappy" (16 January 1989). He nevertheless delivered a paper ("Elizabethan Dramatic Texts: Problems in Semi-Substantives") at the April 1989 Society for Textual Scholarship conference in New York, went to the Huntington Library in May (this time on Mellon Foundation support), and spent the summer at Folly Cove. From the Huntington in early June he made a characteristic report: "I'm getting quantities of work done here, and helping a couple students in off hours when rare book room closed." And back in Charlottesville on 21 June, before leaving for Folly Cove: "I am busting the traditional gut to get my introduction off to England for the next Beaumont and Fletcher volume." What was uncharacteristic in these reports was his emphasis on his exhaustion. He did obtain satisfaction, however, from the work he was still able to do, and from his family and his friendships—he had himself always been the most loyal and considerate of friends. He continued to welcome family gatherings at Folly Cove; and on his last drives there, he was delighted to visit with his wife's granddaughter in Connecticut, having finally given in to the family's request that he make the trip in two days rather than one. (As late as 16 September 1987 he had referred to "a grueling 14-hour drive down from Folly Cove, two hours behind schedule with massive traffic jams.") In Charlottesville, he enjoyed seeing old English department friends, like Martin and Ruthe Battestin, Irby and Betty Cauthen, Don and Polly Hirsch, Robert and Francesca Langbaum, Barbara Nolan, and Tony and Viola Winner, as well as new friends like David and Doris Vander Meulen, who had moved there in the summer of 1984. David Vander Meulen's bibliographical work (stemming from a landmark Wisconsin dissertation of 1981, "A Descriptive Bibliography of Alexander Pope's Dunciad , 1728-1751") was beginning to be widely noticed; and, at Bowers's urging, he joined the Virginia English department that fall, with the understanding that he would assist Bowers in editing SB . Once they got to know each other, Bowers recognized that Vander Meulen was indeed the person he had hoped for as his successor to look after the future of SB and the Virginia bibliographical tradition. Another satisfaction of his last years was the publication in late 1989 of Hamlet as Minister and Scourge and Other Studies in Shakespeare and Milton , a 239-page volume bringing together thirteen of his critical essays (one of which was also bibliographical, the one on "sullied"/"solid"), preceded by a biographically interesting preface. The dedication to Nancy Hale repeated the dedication in his volume of Lyell Lectures twenty-five years earlier, but he could not conceive of dedicating it to anyone else. The essays were drawn from a period of almost three decades: the title essay, his most famous piece of critical writing, was the earliest one (1955), and the latest dated from 1982. After four essays on large themes (tragic reconciliation, dramatic structure, point of view, and "dramatic vagueness" in Shakespeare), the volume concentrated on Hamlet , with six pieces, followed by one on Lear and one on Henry IV ; it closed with the only non-Shakespearean essay in the volume, his 1978 study of Samson Agonistes . David Bevington is quoted on the jacket as saying that the essays taken together "show the cohesion and growth of an impressive critical mind"; and the volume itself has more cohesion than one often finds in a collection of essays, because Bowers kept returning to certain subjects, notably structure and reconciliation—not unrelated in his mind, for he always dealt with the ethical implications of structure (as he had done from the time of his study of revenge tragedy half a century earlier). His critical essays gave permanent form to the kind of criticism that he engaged in so effectively in the classroom: explication thoroughly grounded in historical knowledge. Reviewers naturally compared and contrasted these essays with Bowers's bibliographical and textual work. Robert Y. Turner (in Shakespeare Quarterly , 1991), acknowledging the great influence of Bowers's approach to Hamlet , found the decisiveness and certainty of Bowers's "confident criticism," with its "tightly controlled postulates and definitions," to be related to the rigorous tone of his bibliographical writing. R. S. White (in Shakespeare Survey , 1991), on the other hand, said, "Fredson Bowers was known to my generation as the one who cast a long shadow on textual studies," but this volume "shows him in a more benign light as teacherly guide and critical inspiration." When in early 1990 the next conference of the Society for Textual Scholarship was being planned (for the following year), Bowers agreed immediately to provide a paper, but in the autumn he began to wonder whether he would feel like attending and reading the paper himself. Both his perpetual stomach pains, still unsatisfactorily diagnosed, and his anti-depression medication robbed him of energy and concentration; "it is especially annoying," he said, "that I cannot forget my woes in work since my concentration is so bad that the tension rises if I put in much more than half an hour checking my play bibliography entries. And some days I can't quite manage that." By the time of this letter (15 March 1991), he had decided definitely that he could not attempt traveling to the conference (though he had not given up hope of going to Folly Cove in the summer). It was agreed that I would read his paper for him; but the paper apparently went astray in the mail, and on 8 April, three days before the conference, I telephoned him to ask for another copy. He found one, which he thought was not identical to the one previously sent, and Vander Meulen faxed it to me. On the morning of Thursday, 11 April 1991, at the opening session of the conference, I read his paper "Why Apparatus?" as part of a program that also included a paper by his good friend Jo Ann Boydston. When I returned to my office that afternoon, there was a message to telephone Vander Meulen; he informed me that Bowers had died in his sleep early that morning and had been found by the housekeeper at about the time his paper was being read to the assembled textual scholars in New York. In two weeks he would have been eighty-six. The news was learned by most of the conference participants during the course of the afternoon, and at the banquet the following evening David Greetham, founder and executive secretary of the Society for Textual Scholarship, read a memorial resolution, in which Bowers was described as "the most respected textual critic of this century." After the banquet Jo Ann Boydston and I, over drinks at the Algonquin, exchanged memories of Bowers—conscious of the fact that the three of us had regularly gathered there after these biennial occasions and had last dined together just before the 1989 conference. By having that conversation, we were acting in the spirit of Bowers's wishes for a memorial, because he had left these instructions, dated 25 June 1989: I strongly desire and instruct my friends and former colleagues that no memorial service of any kind should be held for me. If one evening my closest friends want to gather in someone's house and reminisce over sufficent drink, that is the extent of any formal remembrance. I should wish any cash in my possession at death might contribute toward the expenses of this wake. But if the idea does not please, it is of no importance and I shall certainly not know it. I have found that academic memorial services are embarrassing, and it would be inappropriate for me to have a religious service. I hope my friends will not sneak one over on me in this matter, in which I wish to set a good example. On 21 April the Langbaums invited some forty-four of Bowers's friends "for drinks in Fredson's memory"; the only formal reminiscences on that occasion were moving statements by Fredson T. Bowers, Jr., Robert Langbaum, and David Levin (whose letter was read in his absence by J. C. Levenson). Two days later E. D. Hirsch delivered before the university faculty meeting a perceptive memorial resolution. By this time obituaries had appeared in newspapers in New York and London, as well as in papers closer to home; and the more extended process of reflection in scholarly journals was about to begin. Two moments from Bowers's last months, representing breaks in his suffering, offer appropriate tableaux to remember him by. One shows him and the Vander Meulen daughters on a fine March morning, twelve days before his death, picking daffodils in the Woodburn orchard. The other was described by Bowers's oldest son at the Langbaums' gathering: About a month before he died, our daughter Carolyn and her husband Mark visited Dad in Charlottesville, and they expressed a desire to hear his built-in stereo system. He obliged by locating a favorite record, swinging wide the large doors covering the speakers which were located on either side of the entrance to the dining room, and cranking up the volume to its apparently customary earsplitting level. Carolyn tells us that they stood there for 15 minutes with him, not wanting to break his concentration while Dad gazed through the massive living room windows towards the Blue Ridge Mountains and occasionally commented on some technical aspect of the music. The body of Fredson Bowers was cremated, and the ashes were buried on 29 June 1991 in the Hale family plot at Forest Hills Cemetery, Jamaica Plain, Boston, next to the grave of Nancy Hale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V Fredson Bowers's life of scholarship was so productive and so controversial that his name, if not always his ideas, became known to nearly everyone in the field of English and American literary scholarship and to a great many in related fields. He was unquestionably one of the most famous scholars of the twentieth century. The sheer bulk of his publications was sufficient in itself to attract attention: a complete collection of his scholarly works would consist of 172 volumes (his eight books and six pamphlets, sixty-eight volumes of scholarly editions, forty-five volumes of SB , and thirty-three anthologies and twelve editions to which he contributed), plus two hundred issues of periodicals containing pieces by him. (These figures include the three volumes of Beaumont and Fletcher not published during his lifetime, but they exclude those volumes of editions for which he was a consultant and which contain no prose by him.) He published some seven thousand pages of scholarly expository prose, amounting to something like three million words (inclusive of the textual essays in his editions, but not counting the hundreds of pages of discursive notes and other apparatus in them). When one adds to this record the million and a quarter words he wrote on music and his writings on dogs and stamps (along with the activities that lay behind them), his participation in other enjoyments, and his services to his profession, one tends to think of him in nineteenth-century terms, for many people today seem to believe that twentieth-century distractions have made such full lives scarcely possible. A life so full of satisfactions is indeed an accomplishment. His life was significant, however, not merely for the quantity of his endeavors, or the wonder that he could engage so productively in so many of them (a wonder hardly lessened by the knowledge that he suffered from insomnia and never owned a television set); even more important was the nature of his productivity. His presence had a major impact on the history of bibliography—and on the perception of bibliography by those not directly engaged in it. Not only did he symbolize a whole field of scholarship; but people also thought of the field more often as a result of his presence, and saw more often the broad relevance of it. That the texts of verbal works are affected by the material means of their transmission —and therefore that the study of literature in the broadest sense entails the study of books and manuscripts as physical objects—are concepts not yet widely understood by readers in general, or even by all scholarly readers. But more people have probably been exposed to these ideas by Bowers than by any other person. He was a worldly scholar, not only in the sense that his scholarship was an element in a richly varied life but also because he cared nearly as much about promoting an understanding of his field as about contributing substantively to it. His influence was felt through his roles as publicist and catalyst in addition to his activities as research scholar. An examination of that influence can usefully begin with a consideration of the style and tone of his writing, for his reputation—from the beginning—was linked to the personality conveyed by them. Although SB and the Principles were sufficient to earn him the respect of bibliographical scholars early in his career, they alone do not account for the special position he quickly came to occupy in the minds of many people, outside as well as inside the small circle of committed bibliographical scholars. The picture of him was more likely to be that of the advocate, the publicist, the polemicist, for it was he who often, and insistently, called their attention to the field and forced them to consider its indispensability for their own work. He tirelessly pressed the claims for "the bibliographical way" (to echo the title of his 1958 Kansas lecture); and he perennially made statements like this one from his earliest proselytizing talk (at the University of Pennsylvania in 1949): "No matter what the field of study, the basis lies in the analysis of the records in printed or in manuscript form." The justice of his general position cannot be questioned; but the manner in which it was presented caused some people, if they were not already receptive, to resist what seemed to them a hard sell. Advocates are often inclined, through temperament or the repeated necessity of being assertive, to overstate their cases, or to irritate some of their audience through too candid a depiction of the follies requiring correction. There is no doubt that Bowers was occasionally—or, as some thought, more often than that—guilty of these charges. Everyone who has read Bowers must have a collection of favorite examples of his scorn. "First let me," he once said (in the Pennsylvania talk), "utterly cast aside the kind of gossiping about books which is written by and published for amateur collectors and which reaches its nadir in some so-called bibliographies of modern authors or in book-collectors['] manuals." On the same occasion he asserted that library schools "do not know enough to teach analytical bibliography as I understand it, and this deficiency sometimes also means, unfortunately, that books cannot be recorded accurately in libraries." And we recall the curator who was an "outworn cataloguer" deposited in the rare-book room "as a reward for faithful service where the world will pass her peacefully by and no extraordinary demands will interfere with her equable latter years" (the University of California lecture in 1966). These snippets suggest why his talks (and the published papers they became) did not always win him new friends. But his blunt attacks did not arise from a love of controversy: as he said in a letter of 8 February 1986 (echoing similar statements in earlier letters), "I dislike controversy and the acrimony of the scholar." (Nicolas Barker, in his obituary of Bowers, put the matter well: "He was a powerful but never a joyful antagonist." Barker added, with reason, that Bowers's forcefulness "concealed a more tender regard for the sensibility and foibles of his adversaries than they appreciated.") The positions he took were not motivated by petty animosities or perceived slights but always by his deep commitment to the advancement of his field. The movement of his prose was of a piece with his enthusiasm as an advocate. His sentences, often loosely constructed, seemed to rush along and, as they piled up, to envelop a subject. (He once described to his oldest son—in a letter of 27 February 1981—how, as he typed from a half-finished manuscript, "the thing sort of took over by itself and so without regard to my manuscript I went ahead composing on the typewriter until the end.") His was not a tight, elegant, balanced style but a flowing and encompassing one. John Carter, a highly conscious stylist, said in the Times Literary Supplement early in Bowers's career (4 September 1948) that Bowers wrote "in a style sometimes lacking in limpidity." This comment, coming from a person sympathetic with Bowers's aims, was a relatively kind version of what many reviewers (largely British) spelled out in frank detail—noting examples of overly complex sentence structure, fuzzy syntax, and imprecise diction. But there was another point of view, which can be represented by Philip Young, though he was no admirer of Bowers's editorial practice. In an unfriendly examination of the Hawthorne edition (collected in Three Bags Full , 1973), he conceded that Bowers "writes rather well." Young did not elaborate, but one understands the virtues he must have had in mind. Bowers's prose had the strength that comes from immersion in a subject and from an analytical intelligence alert to the ramifications of every point. The density and complexity of his writing reflected both detailed learning and a delight in exploring exhaustively the implications of an observation. This is not to say that such attributes cannot also underlie a spare, orderly prose; and in fact there were times when Bowers's sentences became uncomplicated in syntax and marched along in inexorable order, particularly in extemporaneous talks. (Those of us present at the small conference that brought together six Soviet editors and six American editors, held at Indiana University on 8-11 April 1976, will not forget an afternoon at the Howells edition headquarters when Bowers explained the rationale and procedures of critical editing; speaking without notes, he moved from one point to the next with a simplicity and clarity that not only reflected his familiarity with the subject but also revealed in action the workings of a keen intelligence.) Bowers's temperament was expansive, however, and in his case wide knowledge and acuteness of mind resulted normally in an exuberant prose that had the power of undisguised emotional involvement. Stylistic infelicities tended to be lost amid the onrush of ideas and examples, abetted by conversational clichés. This kind of prose is obviously not to everyone's taste, but it is by no means an ineffective way of using the language. (And it was certainly not unrevised: surviving drafts of his work show extensive rewriting, and in a 1982 interview for a student magazine Nancy Hale said that she had learned the importance of revision from— in the words of the interviewer's summary—"her husband's unceasing modification of his own work.") Bowers's ear, trained by wide reading in English literature and vast amounts of writing from the age of sixteen on, was thoroughly attuned to the nuances of English; and if some individual sentences suggested the reverse, his prose when taken in larger units was generally very effective indeed. The language of such discourse can give rise to serious problems, however, when an imprecise word, used for promotional effect, can be seen, upon reflection, to detract from the intellectual integrity of what is being said. A prime example is Bowers's use of the word "definitive" in connection with critical editions (a usage that fortunately declined in his later years). Those who already understood the nature of critical editing recognized that he was employing "definitive" in a special sense and that the word was rhetorically effective in helping him emphasize the rigor, discipline, and thoroughness of the bibliographical way. They knew, and realized he knew, that no product of critical judgment can ever be definitive. But not everyone knew: some people have been put off by what they regarded as an excessive claim, and others (less critical-minded) have come away believing bibliography and textual criticism to be more definite and factual than they are. In this way a tension sometimes developed, within a single piece, between the charged language of advocacy and the calmer and more precise discourse of the scholarship being advocated. The dominant attitude that always came through, however, was one of uncompromising rigor, and that in itself has been enough to bring his work under attack from those who were made to feel defensive of their own less rigorous ways. Being an active advocate affords unlimited opportunities for giving offense in one way or another, both to the people one wishes to win over and to those who are already converted. If Bowers had written a quieter, less impassioned prose, he might have irritated fewer people, but his message would have received less attention—an outcome not in the long-term best interests of the field. In any case, Bowers's personality did not give him that option: he was not inclined to see any necessity for tempering his opinions in order to win support—and, indeed, no doubt felt that a forthright approach would ultimately command more respect. The persona that emerged from his writing is one that many people have taken pleasure in attacking; but the number who have thereby been blinded to the integrity and coherence of his position are relatively few (if sometimes vocal). The review of The Bibliographical Way in the Times Literary Supplement (19 February 1960) is paradigmatic: it took obvious enjoyment in declaring that Bowers's examples "are delivered like straight lefts to the jaw" and that readers might be "more amenable to conversion if the missionary acted less like Pizarro or Cortes"; but it nevertheless called the essay "required reading." Bowers's forceful lectures outlining the place of bibliographical and textual research in the world of scholarship form a major segment of his output and have been "required reading" for a great many people. His advocacy of his field, which through the printed form of his lectures will continue to be influential, was one of his great accomplishments. Bowers's role as a catalyst of bibliographical advances, closely related to his role as a publicist, benefited from the same qualities. The easy way in which prose flowed forth profusely from him, for example, enabled him to give copious advice, in the form of extremely long letters, to SB contributors, or potential contributors who had submitted articles for consideration. It was not uncommon for them to receive letters of six, eight, ten, or more single-spaced—and sometimes unparagraphed—pages (often with a postscript in his notoriously difficult handwriting). Frequently such letters were the by-products of the actual process of reading: he would go through articles at the typewriter (one of his trusted old machines, which he pecked at with two fingers of his left hand and one of his right and which produced pages that were recognizable at a glance to dozens of correspondents), and he would type out a running commentary as he read. This procedure sometimes resulted in his having to say, at some later place in a letter, that an earlier point he had made should now be disregarded; but even these adjustments of opinion were useful to the authors, who were thus alerted to spots in their articles that might at first be misleading or misunderstood. The authors always knew that their work was receiving Bowers's concentrated attention and that his suggestions grew out of an understanding of—and respect for—what they were trying to accomplish. From the first volume of SB to the last one that he edited, his shaping hand was reflected throughout the published contents. When Curt F. Bühler reviewed the first one (in PBSA , 1949), he explained why it was not a "breach of good taste" for him to undertake a review when an article of his was included in the volume: "there may be advantages in these special conditions since I can testify, not only as a contributor but also as a very minor assistant in regard to another paper, to the great care exercised by the editorial board [essentially Bowers]. It is not too much to say that Professor Bowers virtually rewrote a whole section of my own contribution." Another such instance, the next year, has recently been described by George Walton Williams, who as a graduate student had been asked to give one of his papers to Studies : I was surprised to find set up in type in the center of my article paragraphs I had never seen before. When I asked him what had happened, Bowers acknowledged that they were his: he had had a few thoughts on the topic of my paper and had just slipped them into my argument. "That's what a good editor does," he explained. And so his thoughts became part of my article and were published as if mine. Some months after publication of these "joint" thoughts, W. W. Greg commented on them in an article of his; he particularly praised me for certain insights; they were Bowers's insights, of course. By this silent editorial accretion, a graduate student was helped on his way, an article was strengthened, and a volume of Studies was made a better book. This kind of care—if usually less dramatic—was lavished on contributors for the next four decades. There was another, and even more significant, way in which he influenced the work that appeared in Studies : the solicitation and encouragement that brought the material to him in the first place. Solicitation of articles, which he engaged in continually, was of course a compliment and an incentive to the authors; but equally important was his recognition of bibliographical talent at an early stage and his supportive (if rigorous) criticisms that helped to give both reassurance and direction to those possessing it. He frequently invited his graduate students to contribute to Studies , when he saw that they had appropriate material, and thus helped to launch several of them on notable careers as publishing scholars. As for those who were not his students, Bowers's record of discovering talent extended from Allan Stevenson and William B. Todd, in the first volume, to Adrian Weiss, whose exciting and innovative investigations of Renaissance type fonts appeared in the final three volumes that Bowers oversaw. In the last of them, which was published nine months after Bowers's death, Weiss movingly recorded his indebtedness to Bowers: I dedicate this paper to the memory of Fredson Bowers whose death on 11 April 1991 deprived the bibliographical world of its guiding force. It is a great personal loss as well. He gave validity to my research when I had no idea that it was anything more than an accumulation of amusing bibliographical details. The idea of formulating my methods of analysis was entirely his. Without that guidance it would all have amounted to nothing. His criticisms of my thinking and writing were blunt but respectful of my efforts which, at times, fell far short of the mark. For this I am grateful. Sit tibi terra levis . It is a pleasing coincidence that Weiss's article dealt with A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres , the subject of Bowers's earliest substantial scholarly paper (and, further, that it concerned shared printing, the detection of which had caused Bowers a problem in his first contribution to The Library ). But the significant point is that Weiss was giving voice to sentiments that had been felt by many earlier contributors as well. I can testify myself to the friendly support that underlay his letters to me, from the time of our first correspondence about SB in 1962; his encouraging inquiries (and, sometimes, tentative hints) regarding my work in progress were as important to me as his sensitive and shrewd comments on the work actually submitted. I cannot imagine being read by a more responsive and understanding reader, or receiving more constructive and meaningful encouragement. I know that my feelings are shared by many others; thus a considerable portion of the contents of SB might never have existed without his perceptively chosen words at the right moments. Although SB was certainly Bowers's creature, it did not always speak for him. He conducted it with an open-mindedness that surprised some people, who thought that the assertiveness of his own writing indicated a lack of openness to other points of view. But just as the uncompromising quality of his public statements emerged from a principled and reasoned position, not from personal pique or stubbornness, so his standards for SB concerned cogency and scholarly responsibility, not a particular line of thinking. His position was revealingly illustrated by his response to a short piece I sent him in early 1969, criticizing one of the "notes" in that year's volume of SB : he said that he had planned to answer that note himself in the next volume but was pleased that the reply could now come from someone else. It is not common for an editor to print a contribution in one number and take exception to it in the next; but his willingness to do so was in line with his conception of SB as a place for the interplay of ideas, not the promulgation of a party line. On one occasion, nearly a decade earlier, he published a paper and a rejoinder to it in the same volume: John Russell Brown's defense of modernized editions and Arthur Brown's of old-spelling editions appeared side by side in the 1960 volume. He made no secret about his disagreement with certain other articles he had accepted. In his 1975 volume of collected essays, one of his new footnotes commented on D. F. McKenzie's "brilliantly argumentative article," "Printers of the Mind," published in SB in 1969: I find I cannot accept his attempted disintegration of relatively efficient and economical printing practices in a small London competitive commercial printing-house in the early years of the 17th and the later years of the 16th centuries from the special evidence of the late-Restoration Cambridge University Press printing practices operating on a non-commercial and non-hurried basis without pressure for completion applied by a commercial publisher. Unless one is to scrap analytical bibliography altogether (as Dr. McKenzie comes perilously close to recommending) it may seem sounder to base one's reconstructions on the hypothesis of attempted efficiency, as in Moxon, instead of deliberate inefficiency. (p. 250) This was not the only occasion on which Bowers objected to McKenzie's distrust of analytical bibliography as reflected in this article; but he knew that the article deserved a hearing. Two other new footnotes in his 1975 volume referred critically to an article by Hans Zeller that had just been published in SB : in one he characterized its attitude as a "fetish" (p. 499), and in the other he questioned its use of the word "critical" to describe its approach (p. 527). The policy he always followed in SB was concisely stated in a letter to David J. Nordloh on 17 January 1970: " Studies in Bibliography is always prepared to consider articles about textual theory and practice whether or not they coincide with my own beliefs." Bowers was obviously an active journal editor who influenced the production as well as the final form of the material that he published. The resulting publication has been at the heart of bibliographical developments since its founding. During the first half of the twentieth century, The Library was the journal that conveyed the excitement of being at the center of a growing field; and although its standard of excellence did not diminish in the second half of the century, SB nevertheless became the place after 1948 where one witnessed most dramatically the exploration of new techniques and new areas. One of the remarkable aspects of the impressive succession of SB volumes is that they were the product of a single sensibility. (Bowers's editorial longevity surpassed McKerrow's fifteen years as founding editor of the Review of English Studies and even Pollard's thirty-one-year editorship of The Library .) During this long period he proved himself to be a great editor, in an additional sense to the one usually thought of—for editing a journal is different from editing the text of a classic work of literature. Yet one of the distinguishing marks of his handling of SB is his understanding of the connections between the two. (His experience in thinking about textual matters surely lies behind his sensitive treatment of certain aspects of contributors' manuscripts—recognizing, for instance, that it is more sensible to let British scholars retain their British spellings than to enforce a formal consistency from article to article.) To create a journal that is indispensable to a field, and to maintain its vitality and stature over an extended period, are rare achievements. The role that SB has played in the history of twentieth-century bibliography can hardly be overestimated, and the influence that Bowers exerted through SB is thus one of his enduring legacies. And when one thinks of the additional ways in which his influence operated through the writings and actions of others (his students and the many people who sought, and generously were given, his advice), one sees that his catalytic activities behind the scenes had effects as far-reaching as his promotional activities on the podium. Of his own direct contributions to bibliographical and textual study, those concerned with descriptive bibliography may appropriately be considered first. It was the area in which he made his earliest extended contribution, the Principles , a book that remains his most widely known and influential piece of work; and he brought his focus back to descriptive bibliography at the end of his life, feeling that his Restoration bibliography in progress would be the essential capstone to his career. As he wrote me on 22 October 1985, "It is now . . . clear to me that this is a cap that must be put in place if I am to feel any real and lasting satisfaction." At that point the work had been a part of his life for forty years, a continuous thread in the fabric of his endeavor; but as an item on his agenda it frequently had to yield to other projects. It had been uppermost in his mind in the late 1940s, and again at the end of the 1950s, when it was his Guggenheim project (at that time, according to his Guggenheim application, he had completed his "basic examination" of copies and anticipated that a year "should largely finish the project"); and it surfaced intermittently after that whenever he was in a library and had time to examine some Restoration quartos. Reflecting on Greg's death during his Guggenheim year, he gave most attention to A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration and stated, "Among Greg's many achievements this seems to me to rank as perhaps the greatest"—an achievement that was "something of a miracle." Having written the Principles , Bowers was in a position to see "the originality of mind and the depth of comprehension that went into the detailed formulation" adopted by Greg in his Bibliography . (Eight years later, reviewing Greg's collected essays, he called Greg's collation formulary "an example of creative scholarship of near-perfect proportions.") But what particularly struck Bowers in 1959, given his impatience with abstractions divorced from concrete instances, was the way in which Greg's Bibliography put theory into practice: "in the Bibliography the concrete illustration of the adaptability and simplicity of his comprehensive system was so much more overwhelming than the previous bare statement of theory that common acceptance of his principles as the norm for modern bibliographical writing inevitably followed." Bowers had produced his own statement of theory (by no means a "bare" one); but he would not be satisfied until he, like Greg, had completed a great bibliography to exemplify it. The fact that Bowers felt so strongly about descriptive bibliography and returned to it from textual criticism with an increased sense of its importance may surprise some people, who think of descriptive bibliography as less stimulating. But his final elevation of it was a striking reflection of the view of the field depicted in the Principles , which makes clear the intellectual excitement of its subject. The book shows that the practice of descriptive bibliography is a form of history, with all the same challenges and rewards. Although this point is not discussed explicitly at length, it in fact is the most fundamental and striking insight conveyed by the book—conveyed by its author's practice of treating bibliographies as pieces of writing (not as compilations), by his emphasis—in describing how bibliographers work—on the analysis and interpretation of physical evidence, and by the habit of mind he displays in working through particular examples. That descriptive bibliography is a demanding form of historical scholarship underlies every sentence of the book. Although there were a few earlier scholars who understood these points, none of them produced a detailed manual of practice. The Principles moves well beyond what had previously been written, in two directions: it refines the formulary of collation by examining it in greater detail than had ever before been attempted, reinforcing the discussion with an extraordinary array of examples; and it places the collation in a larger context, offering a comprehensive plan for describing all features of books from all periods. The thoughtfulness of the exposition, which seems to cover nearly every contingency that might arise, remains impressive, even to readers who have gone over it many times. Those who have had occasion to work carefully through every statement of the book have emerged with some minor amendments but have also gained renewed respect for the quality of mind that produced such a structure of argument. The book's great achievement is to have made readily accessible, for the first time, a detailed and comprehensive practical guide to bibliographical procedure, building upon the best that had previously been written on the subject and reflecting a thoroughly considered rationale. It became standard upon publication, and it will remain so. Such an accomplishment is not diminished by noting that it left some work undone and that some of its conceptual approaches may need adjustment. In treating the details of typography, paper, and binding, for example, the book was charting far less explored territory than was the case with signature collation, and there is correspondingly more that one now might feel needs to be added to those discussions. On some larger theoretical issues, a few questions also must be raised: whether, for instance, the traditional approach to signature collation sufficiently distinguished an account of physical structure from a record of printed signatures; and whether the concept of issue could justifiably exclude binding if the binding was the publisher's. When the Principles was published, Bowers (like nearly everyone else) was less experienced in handling books after 1700 than earlier ones, and his account therefore needs more supplementing in its later parts. The failure to think through the implications of issue for volumes in publisher's bindings is an instance of the less perceptive coverage of modern books. Several scholars in recent decades have addressed some of these problems, and more will be said about them in the future, and about other trouble spots in the Principles . (Someone, for example, should publish an adequate index to it.) But such work is in the nature of the maintenance and alteration that a grand edifice inevitably requires, despite the soundness of its basic structure. It is not surprising that when Bowers made remarks supplementary to the Principles , notably in his 1967 Bibliographical Society address, a dominant theme was "degressive bibliography," for any decision to abridge the quantity of detail in bibliographical entries reflects a sense of priorities regarding the purposes served by those entries. Thus whether the emphasis of a bibliography is on literary history and biography (in which case the description of impressions and editions after the author's death may be shortened) or on printing and publishing history (in which case such impressions and editions are no less interesting than those of greater textual significance) is a basic issue to be considered. However this matter is decided, Bowers left no doubt about another: the length of an entry cannot be allowed to determine the amount of investigation performed. The space one devotes to reporting the results of research, in other words, has no bearing on the effort required to determine what one is willing to assert are the facts. There can be no question that he was right on this score; but the propriety of the proportions embodied in published bibliographical accounts will always be a subject of debate, for it can no more be settled finally than the emphases in any other kind of historical account can be prescribed. Whether descriptive bibliographers should be expected to collate texts and whether textual scholars have surpassed bibliographers in sophistication are perhaps finally rather unimportant jurisdictional disputes; what matters is that the work be done, by those who understand how to do it, not how much of it is reported in bibliographies and how much in editions. Bowers's efforts to distinguish these scholarly genres may in the long run seem dated; but his cogent explanation of the relationships between the two provides a grounding of perennial value. His approach to descriptive bibliography, both in concept and in procedure, has been immensely influential—having been taught to thousands of graduate students in literature departments and library schools and having been followed by dozens of bibliographers in writing their bibliographies. (The basic form of entry used in the Pittsburgh Series in Bibliography was designed by him.) A great many people in the book world would join with B. J. McMullin in calling the Principles their "professional 'bible.'" Even though Bowers's Restoration bibliography remains to be completed by another hand, his contribution to descriptive bibliography stands as one of the great achievements in modern scholarship. Bibliographical analysis is a tool of descriptive bibliography, but analysis can of course take place independently of an intention to write a full bibliographical description; and Bowers engaged in analysis in his earliest bibliographical articles, a decade before the Principles . By 1938 he had achieved some sophistication in the use of headlines for analysis; and when he and Charlton Hinman presented papers on headlines at the English Institute in 1941, they were—as matters turned out—offering a preview of how analytical bibliography would develop after they returned from war duty four years later. There is a historical neatness in the fact that the fiftieth anniversary of the Bibliographical Society occurred in 1942 and that for the occasion F. P. Wilson wrote his now-famous account of "Shakespeare and the 'New Bibliography,'" for these events proved to mark the close of one phase of the development of analytical bibliography. What was prophetic about the prewar Bowers and Hinman articles was not simply that they presaged the shift in major activity to America but that they emphasized new techniques for extracting, from physical evidence, details of the printing procedures underlying particular books. As Helen Gardner remarked in her revised edition of Wilson's essay, nearly three decades later, the greatest advances in the intervening years had been in the study of the printing of Shakespeare's plays, and she spoke of this work as the product of "what we must call the 'newer bibliography.'" The earlier development of the field, from Pollard (who was himself a link with the analytical study of incunabula) through McKerrow and E. E. Willoughby to Greg (whose writings were the climax of the prewar phase), resulted of course from the continued exploration of physical evidence; and the "newer bibliography" represented no turning away from this trend. Its distinctiveness lay largely in its more intense focus on minute physical details, particularly on damaged types, and in its repertory of techniques (which expanded rapidly in the postwar years) for organizing those details into page-by-page case histories. Bowers played a critical role in this renewal of vitality in the field both through his early articles (several of which remain—despite later amendments—classic treatments of bibliographical detection) and through his encouragement of analytical work in SB , which resulted in an efflorescence of compositorial study, produced by an impressive assembly of able young scholars. As the years passed, Bowers did not concentrate on this kind of work, as Hinman did, and his accomplishment in this area is not as great as Hinman's. In 1968, T. H. Howard-Hill asserted (in Shakespeare Studies ), "Professor Bowers' own direct contributions to the advance of Shake-spearian bibliographical scholarship have been small, and rarely definitive." Few would contest the view that Bowers's essays in analytical bibliography have not been as important for understanding the printing of Shakespeare's—and other Renaissance dramatists'—plays as have the writings of a number of other scholars; and some of the conclusions he reached (as on Elizabethan proofreading) have since been challenged or overturned. Nevertheless, there remain a considerable number of accomplished and convincing analyses, particularly within the textual introductions to his various editions. As he well knew, inferences drawn from bibliographical evidence rarely reach the level of certainty, and new analyses may modify previous conclusions. But he also recognized that conclusions, however provisional, must be drawn in order to proceed; and the vast body of his editorial work demonstrates the essential role of bibliographical analysis in the textual criticism of authors from the Renaissance to the present. The exemplary role of his analyses, given his prominence and the visibility of his editions, is a major reason (along with his fostering role as editor of SB ) for according him a significant place in the history of analytical bibliography; but one should not overlook the substantive contribution made within those editions, where order is brought (with more or less certainty) to the bibliography of several dozen important works. There is yet another, and equally important, way in which Bowers was of service to analytical bibliography. Although one may regret that he never wrote an equivalent to the Principles for this aspect of bibliographical investigation, he did in effect write the prolegomena for such a book in his 1959 Lyell Lectures, Bibliography and Textual Criticism . The book is subtle, rigorous, and absolutely fundamental, aiming at nothing less than a characterization of the habit of mind required for recognizing, and then responsibly employing, inductive bibliographical evidence. One might perhaps take from it (once again) the conclusion that bibliographers are historians, confronting the same problem that all historians face: how to weigh the preserved evidence in order to reconstruct past events. These points would seem to be unexceptionable and uncontroversial, and indeed the book has been generally neglected; yet it has a role to play in debates about the foundations of research in book history. A suspicion of analytical bibliography, publicized in McKenzie's "Printers of the Mind," exists in other quarters as well—such as among those historians of the book who work in the tradition of the French school of histoire du livre and stress the role of books in society. Recourse to archives, as these writers maintain, is certainly important; but they have difficulty in accepting the great store of existing books as an archive itself, containing primary evidence of printing processes. Anyone who understands that fact finds it a truism that the scrutiny of physical evidence in books cannot be abandoned; but the point is strangely difficult for some people to accept. Underlying this difficulty is a failure to perceive bibliography as historical research and interpretation; therefore Bowers's book ought to be assigned reading for those engaged in such discussion and ought to become increasingly prominent in future methodological controversy. Bowers's impact in the field of textual criticism and scholarly editing is symbolized by the extent of his own published work in this area—three theoretical books, some two dozen major essays, and more than five dozen edited volumes (of works by thirteen authors from five centuries)—to say nothing of some forty-two additional volumes for which he was textual adviser (in the Dewey and Fielding editions), and a number of posthumous volumes in series for which he provided textual plans or procedures (the editions of F. Scott Fitzgerald and William James's correspondence). If, in descriptive bibliography, he did not live to produce a major demonstration of his principles in action, he provided ample testimony to the way his theories of editing could be applied in practice. He emerges from all this work as the preeminent authority of his time on the textual criticism of post-medieval writings; he was also—and this does not automatically follow—the most influential as well. His advice and his practice have not, it is true, been universally accepted; but they have been so widely analyzed that even those who take a different line can scarcely be unaware of how their own views have been affected by the debate. Many of the criticisms inevitably refer to specific textual decisions, or classes of decision, in particular editions. Since any critical edition rests on critical judgment, there will always be grounds for legitimate disagreement on individual cruxes or groups of related ones. Some critics, however, argue as if they believe that only one correct text, or responsible edition, of a work can exist; they do not seem to see that one can disagree with certain judgments in a critical edition and yet understand how those judgments can be defended, and thus still have respect for the edition as a whole. The same critics might well see this point in connection with a critical essay but have not learned that a critical edition is equally the product of judgment, which is necessarily subjective. Bowers embraced the opportunity for judgment in critical editions, regarding judgment not as a necessary evil but as a powerful tool for historical reconstruction. To Bowers's mind, textual criticism—as Ignas K. Skrupskelis (associate editor of the William James edition) has appropriately remarked—was "a means of controlling and stimulating the critical imagination," both for the editor and for the reader. (It is noteworthy that in a 1961 talk with the title "Future Needs for Editing" he emphasized the role of "practical criticism" in literary scholars' lives, stating that research should lead "to a better understanding of works and a greater capacity to teach their artistic values.") He was nevertheless fully aware of how tenuous some critical decisions are and was surprised when other people failed to understand that more than one outcome can be defended. On the controversy over his adoption of Crane's revised ending of Maggie , he wrote in a letter of 24 October 1981: This is a case where honest men may differ and I might very well go to the original ending if I were to do the job again. I was certainly unprepared for the hullabaloo it caused when after all it came down only to a question of an individual estimate whether Crane took the chance to make a literary improvement (as I argued) regardless of whether his initial thought was to remove a possibly censorable scene. There is other evidence in the second edition that he was making literary improvements. But it may be that censorship was stronger in his mind, and I am prepared to admit that possibility. Bowers was more reasonable and open-minded than many of his critics. The magnitude of his achievement in elucidating the textual histories and providing critical texts of such a large number of important writings is not lessened by disagreements about some categories of emendations, or by the realization that no critical text can ever be the only defensible one. There are, however, appropriate grounds for dissatisfaction with certain aspects of Bowers's editorial performance. For example, he had a tendency to engage in the partial regularization of punctuation and spelling. A given author's practice in these matters may of course be a matter of judgment; but, despite his usual statement that authorial preferences were honored, he often seemed to begin with the assumption that an author was consistent in pointing and spelling, or intended to be (an assumption that results in an unwarranted contraction of the area in which critical judgment can operate). And to regularize or normalize on the grounds that an author expected such alteration (a standard occasionally appealed to) seems at odds with his regular rejection of other instances of possibly tacit approval by the author. Another lapse is his attempt to justify omitting punctuation and spelling variants from the historical collation on grounds of principle rather than simply of expense. In the textual essay in the Dewey edition, for example, he said, "since the editors will have adopted as emendations of the copytext all such accidentals variants that seem to be either authoritative or advisable changes, no useful purpose would be served by listing the hundreds and hundreds of publishers' or printers' unauthoritative normalizings of the text on which they worked." In fact, several purposes would be served—the most obvious being that readers would have the opportunity of judging for themselves whether all those variants are "unauthoritative." In the Crane edition, Bowers dismissed the idea of collating multiple copies of magazines containing contributions by Crane: "no useful purpose would be served by multiple machine collation of magazine copies in search of textual variation." Yet magazines are printed objects, just as books are, and they are subject to the same possibilities for variation among supposedly identical copies. Also in the Crane edition, the apparatus for Crane's syndicated newspaper pieces is illogical, reflecting a failure to think through the implications of radiating texts for apparatus: after recognizing that no one of the radiating texts can be a copy-text in Greg's sense, Bowers still chooses one of them (for economy, the one closest to his reconstructed text) as a "copy-text" for purposes of the apparatus and does not report variant accidentals in the other equally authoritative texts. Furthermore, an alarming number of inaccuracies exist in the apparatuses to Bowers's editions; some of the errors have been put on record in the editions themselves (in the last volume of the Crane edition, for example, is a section of nine pages listing errata in the previous nine volumes), and others no doubt remain to be detected. Perhaps there would have been fewer errors if Bowers had not undertaken so many editions and felt obliged to work so fast. An additional problem related to his prolific production of editions, with contents covering such a broad span of time, is that it has unfortunately fueled the already prevalent misconception of editing as a mechanical or technical skill, which—once learned—can readily be applied to any writing. Bowers certainly knew that the critical judgments required by critical editing must grow out of a thorough knowledge of the writers being edited and their times: in Textual and Literary Criticism , for instance, he spoke of the necessity of having a "feeling for its [the past's] idiom, and above all the knowledge of its language for which no amount of enthusiastic dilettante sensibility can adequately compensate" (p. 10). But many people concerned with literature (even among the scholarly public) do not understand the point. No one would wish that Bowers had edited fewer authors simply to avoid this situation; but it is a regrettable fact that his actions sometimes exacerbated it. That he sometimes failed to follow through the implications of his arguments has led Paul Eggert to assert, "Bowers's concentration on questions of editorial methods and standards was not accompanied by an equivalent, philosophic interest in their underlying assumptions." Although this statement is perhaps too harsh, there is no doubt that Bowers was temperamentally less interested in concepts than in procedures. One of the consequences—one that Eggert discusses in some detail—is that he did not clearly work out the relation of authorial expectation to his concept of authorial intention. These various concerns about Bowers's editing do not raise the question of his editorial goal—the construction of texts representing their authors' final artistic intentions. His preference for texts that were as unaffected as possible by the processes of publication (or dramatic production) was a source of some criticism nearly from the beginning; and in his later years those who conceived intention to include expectation, or viewed authorship as social and collaborative, became more vocal. To them, Bowers's concentration on writers as individual creators, rather than writing as the product of a social milieu, seemed unrealistic and old-fashioned. Others believed that his emphasis on "final" intention minimized the importance of textual evolution and instability. These views all reflect valid approaches to textual study that have been neglected and deserve to be pursued; but they do not discredit an interest in final authorial intention, which must remain one of the few available paths to an understanding of writings from the past. When Bowers's editorial career began, it would have been hard to conceive that by the end of his life editions focusing on final authorial intention would be received grudgingly by a number of critics, who found the basic aim misguided. His unswerving devotion to it was quite proper, however; changing fashions in literary scholarship do not alter the basic value of a "Bowers edition," and the majority of readers are still interested in works from the past as the products of individual minds. In his immense series of volumes he set a style for scholarly editions—both in concept and in form—that was widely imitated. Other styles will follow, and other critical editions of the same works will inevitably appear. But his masterly charting of textual histories and his judgments as to the intended wording of numerous texts will continue, into the indefinite future, to affect the way readers approach the authors he dealt with. His influence on scholarly editing was of course also felt through lectures and other writings; and his introductions to the rationale of critical editing—like On Editing Shakespeare (1955), Textual and Literary Criticism (1959), "Textual Criticism" (in the 1963 MLA pamphlet), and "Scholarship and Editing" ( PBSA , 1976)—are still, and seem likely to remain, among the best examples of their genre. In all his editorial writing there is an unflagging insistence on the importance of critical editing to reconstruct authorially intended texts; although he recognized the value of facsimile editions, he felt passionately that documentary texts cannot bring one as close to past intentions as can texts that are the joint product of documentary evidence and informed judgment. His resistance, in some of his late lectures, to the "social" approach to textual criticism came not from closed-mindedness but rather from the belief that a socialized concept of literary production did not lead to textual criticism at all, for an emphasis on texts as they emerged from the process of publication seemed to require the diplomatic or facsimile reproduction of texts. A late lecture like "Greg's 'Rationale of Copy-Text' Revisited" showed the supreme importance to him of the exercise of critical judgment, which he felt should not be hampered by any set of guidelines, even Greg's "Rationale." (Critics who have accused Bowers of dogmatism in pushing the claims of Greg have not taken this important paper to heart.) Those late lectures were the last in his long series of writings on the eclecticism of critical editing, which have set a standard of argument and eloquence that those taking other positions must attempt to equal. He has thus been a powerful force for raising the level on which editorial discussion must be conducted. At the beginning of his Rosenbach Lectures in 1955 he had remarked on the "comparatively little discussion" of the principles for editing printed, rather than manuscript, texts; they have now of course been very much discussed, and the sophistication of his essay revisiting Greg, emerging as it did from a long line of his own essays and responses to them by others, is a measure of the extent to which he is responsible for the profoundly changed environment in which editors of modern writings work. This view of Bowers's achievement makes clear why any serious discussion on a bibliographical theme is bound to involve issues on which he took an illuminating and provocative stand, and why anyone with the slightest exposure to descriptive bibliography, analytical bibliography, or textual criticism has come across his name. The extent of his influence is suggested by the frequency with which one encounters references to him—references sometimes trivial in themselves, yet revealing, like Roy Stokes's allusion to the "grey eminence in Charlottesville" ( Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada , 1979). The graduate students of 1963 who read Frederick C. Crews's The Pooh Perplex no doubt saw something of Bowers in the supposed contribution of "Smedley Force"; at any rate one can maintain that without his presence it is not likely that there would have been a chapter of that book asking "why are there no watermarks in Winnie-the Pooh ? Why are there no chain lines? Why no colophon? Why no catchwords? No signature? No cancelland or cancellans?" If one turns to the Oxford English Dictionary to learn what cancelland and cancellans mean, one finds that quotations from Bowers's Bibliography and Textual Criticism are among the citations offered. Quotations from him appropriately appear in the entries for other bibliographical terms as well, such as collational, copy (as in "copy-text"), ideal (as in "ideal copy"), impression, inner (as in "inner forme"), Q (standing for "quarto"), recto , and skeleton (as in "skeleton forme"), among others. While they were at it, readers for the OED used his writings to illustrate some nonbibliographical words, which indicate how colorful his prose could be: blue-nosed, furor poeticus, heurige (page 3 of Bibliography and Textual Criticism yields, "a headache can be especially acute the morning after tasting Heurige , the new wine"), and stand-off , among others. All told, the second edition of the OED contains fifty-nine quotations from Bowers (forty-four from Bibliography and Textual Criticism , ten from the Principles , four from Textual and Literary Criticism , and one from his 1952 PBSA article, "Bibliography, Pure Bibliography, and Literary Studies"). Bowers also wrote the articles on "Textual Criticism" (1959) and "Bibliography" (1960) for the Encyclopaedia Britannica and thus was a prominent representative of his field in two of the most widely used reference works in the English-speaking world. His fame by now extends beyond that world, as one can see from the work of Roger Laufer and Wallace Kirsop (e.g., Australian Journal of French Studies , 1966); or from Katia Lysy's translation of "Multiple Authority" into Italian (in Pasquale Stopelli's 1987 anthology, Filologia dei testi a stampa ), Conor Fahy's eleven-page Bibliofilia obituary of Bowers in Italian (1991), and his Italian translation of "A Digest of the Formulary" (from the Principles ) in Bibliofilia (1992); or from Sachiho Tanaka's translation of Textual and Literary Criticism into Japanese (1983), Akira Takano's exposition of the Principles in Yōsho no hanashi (1991), and Hiroshi Yamashita's teaching of Bowersian bibliography and textual criticism at Tsukuba. As Yamashita wrote David Vander Meulen on 22 July 1991, "Mr. Bowers's influence in Japan has been quite great not only on English literature but also on Japanese literature"—an influence that owes much to Yamashita's own compositor studies of Spenser and his textual work on Rashomon and Natsume Soseki. The depth of Yamashita's feeling for Bowers—both as individual and as spokesman for an approach—is suggested in a letter he wrote me on 1 June 1992: Since I heard the death of Mr. Bowers last year, I often remember the day when I met him in Birmingham, England in 1972 when Dr. Peter Davison and his students including me had lunch with him. He talked to us about "the problem of multiple authority". I promised him to go to Virginia to study bibliography from him but I could not at last. However, I sometimes wrote to him and he never failed to answer me by a long letter full of invaluable advice. He was extremely kind to us bibliographical students. I keep his last letter to me written two months before his death as my treasure. . . . My main concern (and my duty I believe) has long been to let Japanese people know how important and profound is the bibliographical and textual study (concept) of the [Bowers] school and how useful to edit (reedit) our modern Japanese literary texts. Peter Davison's obituary of Bowers in The Library (1991) mentions the same occasion in Birmingham: I particularly recall his tearing himself away from a packed research programme at Oxford to spend an afternoon—at his own expense—with my bibliography class at the University of Birmingham. It was typical of his belief in the prime responsibility he felt towards the discipline of which he was such an outstanding exponent, and towards those who endeavoured to follow in his footsteps, however haltingly. Bowers's work is naturally still best known in the English-speaking world, which produced a wide array of admiring and affectionate obituary tributes like Davison's—among them Nicolas Barker's in the London Independent (15 April 1991) and David Vander Meulen's in the Johnsonian News Letter (1992), along with a substantial gathering of recollections in the Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook 1991 (1992) and a "Fredson Bowers Commemorative Issue" (Second Quarter 1991) of the Bulletin of the Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand. The awe with which Bowers's attainments were viewed in all of them was conveyed by the opening of Barker's piece: "To revolutionise any branch of human study is an achievement: to do it twice is a triumph. Fredson Bowers brought this off." (The two fields are of course bibliography and textual criticism.) If the so-called "new bibliography," emphasizing the place of physical evidence in literary study, can be designated—as it often is—an Anglo-American approach, we must recognize that Bowers played the pivotal role in causing "American" to be a part of this epithet. What had been essentially a British movement became an active field in American scholarship through the force and breadth of his published writings and through his personal influence. The central position of his work across the whole spectrum of bibliographical-textual studies is what places him in direct succession to the great triumvirate of Pollard, McKerrow, and Greg. One can name other first-rate bibliographical scholars between Bradshaw and Bowers, but none of them matches those three for the size and quality of a body of work that encompasses bibliographical description and analysis and critical editing. And Bowers outdistanced his great predecessors in the range of detail at his command—without recourse to the discoveries of others—to support general observations. Bowers is their rightful heir in the double sense that he built on their achievement and that what he built ranks with their achievement in range and distinction. Comparisons of Bowers with Greg have often been made. F. C. Francis, for instance, in his Feldman Lecture ( A Bibliographical Ghost Revisits His Old Haunts , 1972), said that Bowers "wears the mantle of Sir Walter Greg with such conspicuous success," and he elaborated on the parallel between the two. G. Blakemore Evans, in his review of Bowers's collected essays ( Library Quarterly , 1977), stated that Bowers, "both by precept and example, has done more for those first cousins, bibliography . . . and textual criticism, than any other man in this century except W. W. Greg—a single exception Bowers would himself be the first generously to admit." Not everyone would admit it, but the ranking is not important. Joost Daalder, in a somewhat different comparative evaluation, believed that Bowers "was probably not quite as extraordinary a scholar as Greg" but was "a better literary mind." There is much to be said for this view; but both men were so extraordinary that the only point in making such judgments is the possibility of arriving at a more precise sense of their achievements. Bowers himself had some doubts about Greg's critical abilities, for in his review of Greg's collected essays ( Times Literary Supplement , 28 September 1967) he described Greg's "blind side" as those instances "when the daring of a logically pursued but highly speculative critical argument obscured his usual fine discrimination between fact and fantasy." Regarding a nonbibliographical essay of Greg's on King Lear , Bowers believed that "the end result may be more valuable for the exposure of the simple facts about the dislocations of time than for the critical conclusions drawn from the evidence, which are in part strained." But Bowers firmly believed in the necessity of linking bibliographical and literary considerations; and—whatever he thought of the outcome of Greg's critical thinking—he could still say, "One of Greg's most striking characteristics as a scholar was that in the end his technical skill, as for example in palaeography, was always placed at the service of textual and other forms of criticism." From the beginning Bowers's emphasis was on literary values, and he would not have disagreed with F. W. Bateson's point (in The Scholar-Critic , 1972) that the function of bibliography in textual criticism is "negative—to exclude the irrelevant or to correct what is historically impossible." It is therefore ironic that Bateson, who felt that Greg "was not a literary critic" and who called Bowers "Greg's most enthusiastic American disciple," thought that some of Bowers's arguments illustrated the "dead-end into which textual criticism is driven if it ignores aesthetic considerations." Bateson was not the only person, however, to misunderstand the role of judgment in bibliography and to be misled by Bowers's emphasis on bibliography into thinking that he was more interested in mechanical routines than in literary considerations. The ultimate reputation of Bowers's literary criticism depends on the readers of his editions, where thousands of his literary judgments are embedded. When all these judgments, and the notes discussing some of them, are counted in his literary criticism, as they should be, his position as a critic is seen to be of enormous proportions. Even if one focuses on the more limited body of his critical essays, he remains a prominent critic through his influence on the study of Hamlet and revenge tragedy generally. In 1991 Robert Y. Turner said (in Shakespeare Quarterly ), "Fredson Bowers was one of three or four scholars who set the pace and direction for literary studies of the English Renaissance during his generation. The names of Alfred Harbage and Madeleine Doran come to mind as his peers, but not many others." Whatever group of names one finally fixes on, the fact is that Bowers belongs there, judged not as a "textual" or a "bibliographical" scholar but simply as a literary scholar. A love of literature, as deep as the love of music so movingly depicted in his 1961 Richmond lecture, underlay his literary judgments and his willingness to spend endless hours investigating textual evidence. I believe that Ignas K. Skrupskelis was correct when he said (in Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook 1991 ) that Bowers "did what he did not because he thought it was useful but because it was part of his enjoyment of literature." Skrupskelis then significantly enlarged the point: The Bowers I knew enjoyed what he was doing. He enjoyed challenges to his theories, he liked books, he liked being intimate with authors. And he liked doing things with style, whether driving his Mercedes 250 SL from Charlottesville to Folly Cove in one day or producing urbane footnotes. Bowers's enjoyment of literature and his enjoyment of editing were a part of his enjoyment of a life filled with enthusiasms—for dogs, music, stamps, cars, contract bridge, food, wine, single-malt Scotch, the stock market. The sense of his life as one activity followed by another, punctuated by satisfactions, is conveyed by a passage in his uncharacteristically self-reflective letter of 22 October 1985 (from which I have quoted several times): To be truthful I do not have much of a scholarly ego, and when a job is done it is done and the only important thing is the next one. Of course there are moments of special satisfaction, as, now I recall, when to my surprise, about 4 am on a sleepless night, the answer came to me of how to use a symbol like the asterisk to solve the previously unsolvable problem of how to identify the extent of a manuscript alteration and not only to get rid of those cursed arbitrary symbols that must be memorized, and which change with every editor, but also to put the final reading up front, not buried at the end of a series of signs. And I did enjoy breaking the code of the two different systems of compositor marking for takes in Blithedale Romance and Seven Gables and thus to be able to use compositor analysis at that late date as a tool for sifting variants from the manuscript printer's copy. There are some moments like that which you also have had and will understand the sense of well-being and pleasure when a problem unravels and one sees the light. Except I too often then curse my slowness in getting to a position where the light can indeed shine through. One's natural stupidity and dullness is very hard to overcome. This helps to reduce any (non-existent, anyway) tendency toward conceit at what longevity has helped me to produce. Quite honestly I feel not that I am especially bright except that so many other scholars are not very good either and probably do not work so hard as I used to. And that they do not sufficiently fall into the way of thinking of categorizing, which I have come to feel is the essence of scholarship and the only basis for analysis, or analytical thinking. Whatever he thought of his mental abilities, nearly everyone else saw in him an extraordinary intelligence. But the mood of the passage in other regards—the brisk and unsentimental attitude, the delight in intellectual puzzles and "analytical thinking," the eagerness for the next challenge—does seem accurate. He once described the rewards of bibliographical work, which overshadow the drudgery, as "a generative excitement of exploring the unknown" and of "drawing some maps of terra incognita" (Clark Library lecture, 1966). The terra incognita of the past yields some of its secrets to bibliography, which he described near the beginning of Textual and Literary Criticism as "the only sure foundation on which to rear the necessary wide acquaintance with the whole complex of the past" (p. 10). He pursued the work with joy and vigor, as he pursued all his interests, and the maps that resulted will serve as guides for an increasing number of fields. In thinking about the place of Fredson Bowers in the history of scholarship, we must remember how intertwined in him were the publicist and the scholar, and how interrelated were the responses each aroused. The value of securing for the field a larger place in the scholarly public's consciousness is undeniable, and Bowers's success in this regard was directly related to his stature as a productive scholar: we listen more attentively, if not always with agreement, to the publicist who is not a popularizer but who has actually produced some of the work that makes the field important. If Bowers had not chosen to play this larger role, the state of bibliography today would be less vital and populous, even though he had made his scholarly contributions. It must be admitted that there is a less fortunate side to these connections: temperament and feelings influence scholarly judgment, and some scholars who—for whatever reason—have been offended by, or who disapprove of, the stance of the polemicist may criticize the scholarship without having been open-minded to what it had to say and without fully understanding it. This personal element has entered into commentary on Bowers's scholarship; it is one of the side-effects of his unique position. What we should concentrate on in the future is a productive criticism of his work. I think it can be said that in descriptive bibliography, in analytical bibliography, and in textual criticism an understanding of his treatment of the basic issues is an essential ingredient of future progress: his work may need, here and there, some revising and extending, but to proceed without recourse to it would be folly. In matters of consequence, the last word can never be said; the highest praise is not that one's work has ended debate but that it is indispensable for further discussion. Reciting Bowers's accomplishments is therefore only the beginning of a proper assessment; our debt to him is adequately acknowledged only when we understand that our discussions, now and in the future, must build on his. To find that some of his practices or conclusions require rethinking or amplification is not to diminish his achievement; indeed, it is the best way to underscore his accomplishment, because it reveals that whatever we say takes its bearings from what he has already said. In Nancy Hale's The Life in the Studio , we read, "With their instinct for making something, artists tend to respect the past as something also made." The bibliographical way, like all other paths to the past, requires the shaping vision of the scholar-artist. Bibliographical clues, like the objects she found in the studio, serve as "keys to release the life that trembles behind them in the void," a life that one "otherwise would never have suspected was there." She might have been describing her husband's writing. And he understood the ways in which his work was similar to hers: in 1982 he told an interviewer, "I think some of my wife's intuitiveness has rubbed off on me." The effort to establish what a printer did, or what an author thought, at a particular moment in the past is not essentially different from any other exercise of the historical imagination. There are responsible ways, and irresponsible ways, of marshaling the preserved evidence to create a picture of the past. What we have cause to admire in Fredson Bowers's work, whether or not we agree with every detail of it, is his responsible and imaginative fashioning of bibliographical evidence into a coherent view of certain kinds of past events. His writings have made, and will continue to make, the bibliographical way of thinking a presence in many people's lives, through the artistry of his creative scholarship.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Note on Sources Fredson Bowers put himself on record voluminously, and his own writings, which are naturally the primary source for his intellectual biography, also contain a surprising amount of personal information. (They are recorded in the accompanying checklist, which is followed by a chronology.) Among other printed sources, there are several pamphlets of biographical interest that appeared in connection with significant moments in his life: at the time of his Gold Medal from the Bibliographical Society, John Carter's elegant assessment was printed in The Gold Medal of the Bibliographical Society: Graham Pollard, Fredson Bowers, 1969 (1969); at the time his last year of teaching began, a chronology of his life and a selection of photographs (described in the text above) appeared in A Keepsake to Honor Fredson Bowers (1974), and a list of the students who wrote dissertations with him was included in a menu-keepsake entitled Honoring Fredson Bowers: A Dinner with His Doctoral Students (26 October 1974); and at the time of his eightieth birthday, Fredson Bowers at Eighty (1985; reprinted from Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America [ PBSA ]) contained my address "The Achievement of Fredson Bowers" (many passages from which are incorporated into the last section of the present essay), David L. Vander Meulen's "The History and Future of Bowers's Principles ," David J. Nordloh's brief account of "The Bowers Eightieth-Birthday Conference," a resolution from the Bibliographical Society of America, and a checklist supplementing Bowers's own checklist of his writings in his 1975 Essays (which also included a chronology). Bowers's death of course produced a large outpouring of biographical accounts and memoirs. Two substantial gatherings have appeared: a "Fredson Bowers Commemorative Issue" (ed. Ross Harvey) of the Bulletin of the Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand (15.2 [Second Quarter 1991], 45-102), which contains reminiscences by Hans Walter Gabler, Clive Probyn, and David L. Vander Meulen, along with articles by Joost Daalder (on Marlowe's Doctor Faustus ), Paul Eggert (on Bowers's textual practice), B. J. McMullin (on the Principles ), and Peter L. Shillingsburg (on the concept of work ); and "Fredson Thayer Bowers" in the Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook 1991 , ed. James W. Hipp (1992), pp. 224-253, which contains articles by Matthew J. Bruccoli (on working with Bowers), Irby B. Cauthen, Jr. (on Bowers as teacher), George L. Geckle (on Bowers as literary critic), Ignas K. Skrupskelis (on Bowers as editor of William James), Robert Kean Turner (on Bowers as editor of Beaumont and Fletcher), David L. Vander Meulen (on Bowers as music critic), and George Walton Williams (on Studies ). Among the other notable obituary tributes are Nicolas Barker, "Professor Fredson Bowers," The Independent (London), 15 April 1991 (reprinted in Book Collector , 40 [1991], 257-259); Jo Ann Boydston, "In Memoriam: Fredson Thayer Bowers," Documentary Editing , 13 (1991), 68; Peter Davison, "Fredson Thayer Bowers," The Library , 6th ser., 13 (1991), 356-358; Conor Fahy, "In Memoriam Fredson Bowers (1905-1991)," Bibliofilia , 93 (1991), 311-321; Roy Flannagan, "The Death of Fredson Bowers," Shakespeare Electronic Conference , 2.126 (5 May 1991); G. Thomas Tanselle, "In Memoriam: Fredson Bowers, 1905-1991," PBSA , 85 (1991), 183-187, and "Fredson Thayer Bowers," Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society , 101 (1991), 235-240; David L. Vander Meulen, "In Memoriam: Fredson Thayer Bowers (1905-91)," South Atlantic Review , 56.3 (September 1991), 165-167, and "Fredson Bowers and the Eighteenth Century," Johnsonian News Letter , 52.2-3 (June-September 1992). For the general context of bibliographical history into which Bowers's work fits, one might turn to my "Issues in Bibliographical Studies since 1942," in The Book Encompassed , ed. Peter Davison (1992), pp. 24-36. The influence of Bowers in the fields of descriptive bibliography and textual criticism is so pervasive that almost everything about them since mid-century discusses him in one way or another. For descriptive bibliography, the places to start are Vander Meulen's PBSA article cited above; two Engelhard Lectures, his Where Angels Fear to Tread (1988) and my A Description of Descriptive Bibliography (1992; also printed in Studies in Bibliography [ SB ], 45 [1992], 1-30); and my "A Sample Bibliographical Description with Commentary," SB , 40 (1987), 1-30, which records the major articles that supplement the Principles . For textual criticism, I will mention two titles of mine, only because they attempt to provide comprehensive surveys of the textual debates of this period and therefore can serve as a guide to an extensive literature dealing with Bowers's ideas: Textual Criticism since Greg (1987), supplemented by "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology," SB , 44 (1991), 83-143. Reviews of Bowers's monographs and editions of course form another extensive body of commentary. In the present essay I have mentioned the reviews that seem to me the most significant or useful, and I shall not repeat those references here. For additional reviews of the Principles , one should consult Vander Meulen's 1985 article (cited above). For some of the other books and editions, I list here a few more worthwhile reviews: on Elizabethan Revenge Tragedy —Frederick S. Boas in Year's Work in English Studies (1940), Edgar C. Knowlton in South Atlantic Quarterly (1941), and Leland Schubert in Quarterly Journal of Speech (1940); on On Editing Shakespeare —James G. McManaway in Shakespeare Survey (1956); on Textual and Literary Criticism —Johan Gerritsen in English Studies (1967), Donald J. Greene in Studies in English Literature (1961), Victor M. Hamm in Thought (1960), John Edward Hardy in Yale Review (1959-60), F. D. Hoeniger in Queen's Quarterly (1960), James G. McManaway in Shakespeare Survey (1961), and Times Literary Supplement (17 April 1959); on Bibliography and Textual Criticism —Robert Donaldson in The Library (1965), Paul S. Dunkin in American Notes &amp; Queries (1965), and Johan Gerritsen in English Studies (1967); on Beaumont and Fletcher edition—G. I. Duthie in English Language Notes (1966-67), Philip Edwards in The Library (1968), and Johan Gerritsen in Review of English Studies (1969, 1972, 1979); on Crane edition—Peter Davison in The Library (1972) and G. Thomas Tanselle in Book Collector (1974); on Dekker edition—J. R. Brown and W. W. Greg in Review of English Studies (1956, 1963) and Karl J. Holzknecht and Thomas B. Stroup in PBSA (1955, 1959); on Fielding edition—Frederick W. Hilles in Yale Review (1975; replied to by Martin C. Battestin, 1976) and Michael Irwin in Review of English Studies (1976); on Hawthorne edition—John Freehafer in Jahrbuch für Amerikastudien (1970), Leon Howard in Nineteenth-Century Fiction (1967-68), Buford Jones in Studies in the Novel (1970), G. Thomas Tanselle in Book Collector (1974), and Dennis Welland in The Library (1964); on Marlowe edition— Times Literary Supplement (8 February 1974); on Whitman edition—I. R. Willison in The Library (1956). In addition, the annual commentaries in Year's Work in English Studies and Shakespeare Survey should be examined: Bowers's name appears in the indexes nearly every year during his most active period. A number of sources provide background for specific aspects of Bowers's life. For information on the family Bowers thought himself to be descended from, see Charles Candee Baldwin, Rev. John Bower, First Minister at Derby, Conn., and His Descendants (1879); for a picture of Brown University in Bowers's time, see By Quentin Reynolds (1963), in addition to the biographies of S. J. Perelman and Nathanael West cited in the essay; for an understanding of Bowers's place in the world of dogs, see the fiftieth-anniversary number of Harp &amp; Hound , 27.1 (1976), esp. 19, 36-41 (and the earlier and briefer account in 5.2 [Spring 1954], 37); for a thorough listing of Bowers's music reviews (with the main subject of each column indicated), see John Denniston, "Fredson Bowers and 'Music Off Records': An Index of Newspaper Columns, 1939-1967" (April 1990 typescript, available in the Special Collections Department, University of Virginia Library); for Bowers's place in the local stamp scene, see Bernard P. Chamberlain, "History of Charlottesville Stamp Club, 1936-1961" (1 September 1961 typescript, available in the Albemarle County Historical Society). Nancy Hale's autobiographical and critical writings—especially A New England Girlhood (1958), The Realities of Fiction (1962), and The Life in the Studio (1969)—contain many passages relevant to the study of Bowers's life. Biographical accounts of Nancy Hale also inevitably contain relevant information; see the articles by Anne Hobson Freeman in the Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook 1980 , ed. Karen L. Rood, Jean W. Ross, and Richard Ziegfeld (1981), pp. 212-219, and 1988 , ed. J. M. Brook (1989), pp. 218-228 (the latter also containing tributes by John C. Coleman, Philip Hamburger, Mary Gray Hughes, William Maxwell, and John Frederick Nims), and the article by Laurie Buchanan in Dictionary of Literary Biography , 86 ( American Short-Story Writers, 1910-1945, First Series , ed. Bobby Ellen Kimbel, 1989), 124-129. The Bowerses were interviewed many times by local reporters; three particularly useful news stories about them are Anne Simmonds, "A Profile of a Lioness of Letters," Charlottesville Daily Progress , 9 June 1966; Doug Kamholz, "Writing Careers for Charlottesville Couple Are a Natural," ibid. , 18 November 1979; and Paige Tucker, "A Tale of Two Authors," Creator [sponsored by the Cavalier Daily ], March-April 1982, pp. 20-22. (These and other news stories are available in a clipping file at the Albemarle County Historical Society.) Many of the details in the present essay come from manuscript sources or from conversations and correspondence I have had with persons who knew Bowers. The principal collection of his papers is in the Special Collections Department of the University of Virginia Library (much of it housed under the classification numbers 5691 and RG-21/30.801, .811, .872, .881-.884, .901, .911). His work on the Crane and Nabokov editions is particularly well represented, but there are papers relating to other editions, as well as typescripts and proofs of a number of his articles, and some correspondence. Bowers's extraordinary term paper for Hyder Rollins at Harvard is a part of this collection (RG-21/30.882), as are the manuscript and typescript of his Richmond lecture on music (5691-f). Letters from this collection mentioned in the essay are Bowers's to Mrs. James Southall Wilson, 28 June 1963 (6453-f); Bowers's to David J. Nordloh, 17 January 1970, and to Matthew J. Bruccoli, 7 February 1970 (both RG-21/30.883); and A. L. Rowse's to Bowers, August 1982 (5691-ag). I am grateful for permission from the Library to quote from these documents. Some important letters to Henry Allen Moe and Gordon N. Ray are in the files of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, along with Bowers's statements of plans for, and reports on, his Guggenheim Fellowships. All other quoted letters of Bowers—to Fredson T. Bowers, Jr., Jo Ann Boydston, David L. Vander Meulen, and me—are still in the hands of the recipients. (I am to be understood as the recipient whenever no other person is stated.) I have also drawn on several other unpublished documents: letters in the files of the University of Virginia English department (including V. A. Kolve's letter to Bowers, 28 May 1980); the typewritten citation for Bowers's Thomas Jefferson Award, 13 April 1971; typewritten reminiscences by Fredson T. Bowers, Jr., along with his compilation of excerpts from his father's letters and from other letters and tributes; memorial statements by Robert Langbaum and David Levin (21 April 1991); E. D. Hirsch's memorial resolution for the University of Virginia faculty meeting on 23 April 1991; and Hiroshi Yamashita's letter to David L. Vander Meulen, 22 July 1991. I wish to express my gratitude to the following archivists, librarians, and representatives of organizations for their gracious assistance, in correspondence and in person: Ann Sergi, American Kennel Club Library; Susan Dixon, American Philatelic Research Library; Martha L. Mitchell and Gayle Lynch, Brown University Archives; Maxine Sullivan, University of Chicago Registrar's Office; Bruce Rutherford, Collectors Club Library; Martin Antonetti and Kimball Higgs, Grolier Club Library; Nancy Boyden, Harvard University Student Affairs Office; Alfred de Quoy and Mrs. Charles F. Schreiner, Irish Wolfhound Club of America; Warren F. Kimball, Jr., Mobile Post Office Society; James W. Campbell, New Haven Colony Historical Society; Carl Esche, Princeton University Archives; Maida Goodwin, Smith College Archives; and Kathryn N. Morgan and Michael F. Plunkett, University of Virginia Library Special Collections Department. I am also greatly indebted to the following individuals (some of whom are quoted in the text) for their friendly cooperation and invaluable help: Martin C. and Ruthe Battestin, David M. Bevington, William H. Bond, Fredson T. Bowers, Jr., Jo Ann Boydston, Mark Eccles, Richard Colles Johnson, Gwin Kolb, Vera Brodsky Lawrence, Robert V. Lindsay, Nina W. Matheson, David Rubin, Samuel Schoenbaum, Sue Schwager, William B. Todd, Michael L. Turner, Robert Kean Turner, Jr., David L. and Doris Vander Meulen, James M. Wells, Anthony Winner, and Hiroshi Yamashita. Three of these people must be singled out for their special contributions: Martin Battestin, Bowers's literary executor, for his permission to quote from Bowers's letters and other unpublished writing; Fred Bowers, Jr., for his readiness to locate family details and share them with me; and Dave Vander Meulen, for his indefatigable researches, which went far beyond the call of duty, even for an editor of SB . The generosity of their assistance is a reflection of the depth of their feeling for the subject of this essay.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Preliminary Handlist of Books to which Dr. Samuel Johnson Subscribed by D. D. Eddy and J. D. Fleeman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Introduction The books to which Samuel Johnson subscribed are worth identifying, both because they depict his range of associations and because they may be presumed to have been at some time on his shelves and formed part of his reading. Some can be recognized from the catalogue of the sale of his books at Christie's, 18 February 1785. Several of the actual copies are known to have survived; 1 some of these are already mentioned in J. D. Fleeman, A Preliminary Handlist of Copies of Books associated with Dr. Samuel Johnson (Oxford Bibliographical Society, Occasional Publications no. 17, 1984). 2 The following list is an attempt to bring together the titles which include Johnson's name among their subscribers. This task was first attempted by Iolo A. Williams in his Points in Eighteenth-Century Verse (1934), 111-113. A slightly fuller list was offered by Donald D. Eddy, J. D. Fleeman, and W. R. Keast in the Johnsonian News Letter , 25.4 (Dec. 1965), 2-3, and again in the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature , ii (1971), col. 1150. Further additions were proposed by R. H. Lonsdale, 'Johnson as Subscriber: some Additions', Notes &amp; Queries , 225 (Oct. 1980), 410-412, and by the late H. B. Forster, Notes &amp; Queries , 228 (Feb. 1983), 54-55. The chronological appendix that follows the main listing by author reveals that Johnson subscribed to eleven books in the 1750s, fourteen in the 1760s, eighteen in the 1770s, and, although he died in 1784, seventeen books in the 1780s. The most active period by far involved twenty books from 1772 to 1782. The earliest volume to which he subscribed is Brooke's Gustavus Vasa of 1739 (10). We list the Palladio, of 1738 (46), merely because of its proximity in time; because of the subject matter we have little faith in the attribution. We omit entirely such earlier works as John Oldmixon's History of England during the reigns of the Royal House of Stuart . . . (London, 1730; copies at NIC, Goldberg). The name of 'Mr. Samuel Johnson' is among the subscribers, but we do not believe that our Samuel Johnson, virtually penniless at the age of twenty-one, subscribed to the book. Apparently as Johnson's fame and reputation increased, he was solicited more frequently for subscriptions; and as his personal finances improved, he was able to subscribe more often. The final three books in the list were published after his death, yet there is every indication that these were genuine subscriptions by Johnson. The form in which Johnson's name is recorded in the subscription lists is not always unequivocal: 'Mr. Johnson' requires stronger supporting evidence than does 'Samuel Johnson, LL.D.', but in a preliminary list such as this there is not always room for debate. At this early stage we have preferred to be inclusive, and there are doubtless several items here which will eventually be discarded or degraded. Corroboration of an identification must derive from some association with the names of Johnson's known acquaintances, yet of those there is no complete list. Johnson's letter of (?) December 1753 ( Letters 49.1) and the progress of the subscription for his own edition of Shakespeare show that it was usual to enlist the aid of friends. 3 The notes of Dr Lonsdale and of Mr Forster supply further arguments. We are indebted to both of them for their generous communication of several discoveries. The main entries and dates are those listed in the Eighteenth-Century Short Title Catalogue (ESTC). Four other categories usually follow: the form of Johnson's name that appears in the subscription list, notes chiefly about other subscribers, published references to the book or to Johnson's connection with it, and the copies on which the record is based. A full listing of copies presents some difficulties, for with few exceptions the following titles are not scarce (ESTC sometimes reports fifty or more locations). It seems unnecessary to record all of these since ESTC is now widely available on microfiche, in an on-line database through RLIN terminals, and on CDROM. Furthermore, because each verified entry in ESTC supplies a call-number or shelf-mark, we have also omitted these from the list. Locations recorded here make no pretensions to a census, and they are verified either by ESTC or by the personal inspection of the compilers. The three libraries best known to us are the Bodleian, Cornell, and the National Library of Scotland. We are grateful to Mrs. Charlotte A. Stewart-Murphy for keeping us abreast of the fine holdings in McMaster University Library, in Hamilton, Ontario. We are also indebted to many friends, booksellers, librarians, and collectors, preeminent among whom is Herman W. Liebert, whose distinguished collection until its recent dispersal made a prominent showing in this list, and whose unerring instinct for a Johnsonian item has contributed greatly to our compilation. There are few items here which he did not at some time own, and fewer which he did not know. His inexhaustible enthusiasm and assistance deserve particular thanks.

      <field name="heading_text">Rehabilitating the A-Text of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus by Eric Rasmussen *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Few bibliographical theories are so apparently unassailable and, paradoxically, so constantly assailed as the prevailing belief that the 1604 quarto of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus (the "A-text") is a corrupt, memorially reconstructed, "bad" quarto. Ever since the argument was first advanced by Leo Kirschbaum in 1946 and supplemented by W. W. Greg in 1950, the memorial reconstruction theory has enjoyed the status of fact. 1 In 1952, Fredson Bowers was wholly convinced ("we may take it as fully proved that the A-text is a reconstruction from memory of the play as originally performed"), and he remained so in 1973: "facts are facts." 2 Thus dismissed as a "bad" quarto, the A-text has been relegated to the appendixes in nearly every edition of the play completed in the last half-century. And even those who choose to edit the A-text acknowledge that "signs that it has been memorially reconstructed are incontestable." 3 Though seemingly incontestable, the fact of the A-text's memorial origins has encountered nearly a half-century of contestation. Bowers himself, pointing out that the B-text contains entire scenes that are not in the A-text, observed that "the reporter of the A-text would need to have suffered a complete blackout." 4 Alternatively, Bowers argued that the substantial differences between the two textual versions of Faustus might best be attributed not to memory failures on the part of a reporter but to the presence in the B-text of additional passages, probably the "adicyones in docter fostes" for which Henslowe paid £4 to William Birde and Samuel Rowley in 1602, that are absent from the A-text. Although Bowers is not prepared to abandon memorial reconstruction ("the case for A1 as a bad quarto is weakened but not, I am strongly inclined to think, destroyed"), he now finds virtue in an if : "the A-text, if it is a report . . ." ("The 1602 Additions," p. 2n., 4). Other Marlowe scholars are more skeptical still. Constance Brown Kuriyama contends that "the case for A's being a reported text rather than a heavily cut and otherwise debased text is hardly conclusive." Michael Warren also expresses doubts: "the 'reported text' hypothesis is poor in relation to the A-text." And, in a posthumously published essay on Faustus , William Empson can hardly contain his contempt for " memorial reconstruction , that romantic darling of the modern expert." 5 The theory of the A-text as a memorial reconstruction is further cast into doubt by its enthusiastic critical reception, both early and late. No other "bad" quarto went through three editions in the seventeenth century, and no other supposedly corrupt Renaissance text has found such favor in the twentieth. Although literary interpreters have little use for the "bad" quartos of Hamlet or Romeo and Juliet , influential critics such as C. L. Barber and Stephen Greenblatt employ the A-text of Faustus despite its apparently unauthoritative status. As Barber explains, "my experience as a reader runs counter to the conclusions . . . which W. W. Greg arrives at from textual study." 6 So too, if a Shakespearean "bad" quarto text is ever performed it is only as a dramatic curiosity; and yet, both the Royal Shakespeare Company and Chicago's Court Theater chose the A-text of Faustus for their 1989 productions of the play. There appears to be a zeitgeist at work as scholars and theater companies embrace the A-text and so reject (or simply ignore) the rulings of bibliographers. It would seem that the time has come to reappraise the bibliographical facts and re-evaluate the theories surrounding the A-text of Doctor Faustus .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II In January of 1601, the publisher Thomas Bushell entered in the Stationers' Register for his copy of "A booke called the plaie of Dcor ffaustus." 7 The first known edition of Faustus is a black-letter quarto, known as A1, printed by Valentine Simmes for Bushell in 1604. The A1 quarto collates A-F 4 , but the unique copy in the Bodleian Library, classified Malone 233(3), lacks F4, which was presumably blank. In his study of the printing of A1, Robert Ford Welsh notes that identifiable headlines recur in groups and maintain their relative positions (except on sheet E). 8 Apparently, the quarto was printed with two skeleton-formes throughout, the skeletons switching formes in sheet E. Welsh suggests that the switch of the skeletons at E may have been due to some break in the printing process between sheets D and E ("Printing," p. 111). This may well be, for there is another anomalous change between sheets D and E that has not been previously noticed: in sheets A-D each page has 37 lines of type, but sheets E-F have only 36 lines per page. Such a change in the number of lines per page might be taken as a sign that Simmes had shared the printing of the quarto with another printer. 9 Moreover, sheet F of the only surviving copy has a different watermark from the previous sheets. Such a change in paper might also be suggestive of a change in printer. However, the watermark on sheet F is found in some copies of Q3 of I Henry IV (STC 22282), which was also printed by Simmes in 1604; so it seems likely that Simmes simply ran out of the paper that Bushell had supplied for Faustus , and so had to use another stock that he had on hand for the final sheet F. Such a hypothesis supports Bowers's contention that sheet A was not cast-off and set last, but was instead the first to be composed ( Complete Works , II.146). Moreover, the 82 mm. black-letter font used in sheets E-F is the same as that used in A-D, and the fact that several identifiable types from the earlier sheets recur in the later effectively rules out the possibility of shared printing. 10 The A1 quarto was set in type by two compositors, first distinguished by Welsh who labeled them X and Y . Welsh's Compositor X abbreviates speech headings and punctuates them with a period, uses an upper-case " E " in Exit directions, prefers - ea - spellings in words like year , dear , and chear , prefers bloud over blood , and uses - ll spellings in words like will , shall , and hell . Welsh's Compositor Y frequently uses unabbreviated and unstopped speech headings or abbreviated speech headings punctuated with a colon. In contrast to X , Y uses a lower-case " e " in exit directions, prefers - ee - spellings in words like yeer , deer , and cheer , prefers blood over bloud , and uses single - l spellings in words like wil , shal , and hel . Although Y 's habits may reflect simple spelling preferences, they should also be seen to represent work-saving expedients. The black-letter font (probably of French origin) included - oo - and - ée - ligatures. Y apparently had no desire to set two pieces of metal if he could get away with setting only one: thus his preference for blood over bloud , - ee - over - ea -, and - l over - ll . Welsh surveyed all of the dramatic quartos Simmes printed from 1603 to 1605 and concluded that "we have no relevant knowledge of either Compositor X or Compositor Y outside of the Faustus quarto itself" ("Printing," p. 126). However, the habits of Welsh's Compositor Y resemble those that W. Craig Ferguson had previously noticed in Q1 of 2 Henry IV , printed by Simmes in 1600: unabbreviated speech headings and exits with lower-case " e ". Moreover, the compositor of 2 Henry IV , designated Compositor A by Ferguson, resembles Compositor Y of Faustus in that he does not distinguish names by setting them in a contrasting type font. 11 Ferguson's essay has been supplemented by a series of articles by Alan Craven which, taken together, claim that Compositor A set the type for quite a bit of Renaissance drama as we know it: all or part of Q1 Richard II (1597), Richard III (1597), Q2 Richard II (1598), A Warning for Fair Women (1599), An Humorous Day's Mirth (1599), Much Ado about Nothing (1600), The Shoemakers' Holiday (1600), Q2 The First Part of the Contention (1600), Q1 2 Henry IV (1600), Q1 Hamlet (1603), Q3 I Henry IV (1604), and Q1 and Q3 The Malcontent (both 1604). 12 Ferguson and Craven attach a great deal of importance to the unusual (although by no means unique) compositorial habit of setting unabbreviated and unstopped speech headings; any dramatic quarto printed by Simmes between 1597 and 1604 in which such speech headings appear is automatically assigned to Compositor A . The assumption that only one of Simmes's compositors would ever have set an unabbreviated speech heading without adding a mark of punctuation is so strong that little significance is attached to some of the manifest differences between the texts attributed to Compositor A . Q1 Hamlet , for instance, is assigned to A despite the fact that "proper names (characters and places) in the dialogue are often set in contrasting italic type, a practice never used in 2 Henry IV and Much Ado " (Craven, 1973; p. 40). And even though one of A 's hallmarks, setting lower-case exits , is nowhere to be found in Q3 of I Henry IV , Craven asserts that this evidence should not "raise doubts" about the identity of the compositor (1979; p. 188). As the dramatic texts for which Compositor A was assigned responsibility began to multiply like Falstaff's men in buckram, A1 Faustus was added to the list by Craven, who asserts (in a brief footnote) that Welsh's Compositor Y and Compositor A are one and the same (1973; p. 49n). The identification was accepted by Bowers, who, in the textual introduction to his Cambridge edition of Faustus , substitutes A for Welsh's Y . There are indeed a few points of similarity between Compositor Y in Faustus and Compositor A : both show a preference for eie over eye and the - nesse suffix over - nes . But these minor similarities are outweighed, it seems to me, by major differences. Welsh's Y has a nearly absolute preference for the spelling blood (8 occurrences; the spelling bloud appears only once in Y 's share of Faustus ). However, Craven has shown that A has a nearly absolute preference for bloud (37 occurrences in Q1 Richard II and 30 occurrences in Richard III ; the spelling blood does not occur in A 's supposed share of either of these two texts). Moreover, whereas Compositor Y has a marked preference for singe - l spellings, Ferguson characterizes A by his preference for the longer - ll form (1960; p. 23). Craven, intent upon proving that A and Y are the same workman, admits that single - l spellings are indeed "rare" in A 's work, and is forced to dig back to Q2 of Richard II (1598) to find a single example of this habit among the multitude of texts he attributes to A (1973; p. 49n). Although the characteristics of Compositor Y in Faustus do resemble, to a certain extent, those of Compositor A in Q1 2 Henry IV (1600), we ought to bear in mind Peter Blayney's caveat that "similar habits found a year or so apart in the same printing house do not prove identity." 13 Of the dramatic quartos that Simmes printed in 1604, the same year as A1 Faustus , Craven has assigned three to Compositor A . These three texts do contain the unabbreviated and unstopped speech headings necessary for attribution to A , but the other distinguishing characteristics of Compositor Y appear not at all (see table 1). Table 1: Compositor Y 's Characteristics in A1 Faustus Compared with Other Play Quartos Printed by Simmes in 1604 Text unabbrv. Names Single - l Unstopped Lower- not set in Spellings Speech case contrasting Headings exits font A1 Faustus Yes Yes Yes Yes Q1 Malcontent Yes No No No Q3 Malcontent Yes No No No Q3 I Henry IV Yes No No No I suspect (although I cannot prove) that, over a period of eight years, Simmes may have employed more than one compositor who did not abbreviate and did not punctuate his speech headings when he set a play quarto, and that "Compositor A " as he is currently constructed was probably a number of different workmen. In any case, I can find little evidence to support Craven's identification as it pertains to Faustus , for it seems clear that Welsh's Compositor Y is not Compositor A . Moreover, the habits of X and Y in Faustus do not resemble the recurring patterns of the two other identified compositors ( B and S ) who worked for Simmes. 14 Although Compositors X and Y have not been found at work on any other Simmes book, they can be readily distinguished within the text of A1 Faustus where their individual habits form clear and regular patterns. The alternating groups of speech heading punctuation on sheet C may serve as an example (see table 2). This sort of patterned alternation might in itself be sufficient evidence from which to deduce that compositor shifts have taken place at C2r:25, C3r:28, C3v:31, and C4v:16. When the punctuation data are combined with the spelling evidence, the compositors' stints can be charted throughout the quarto with some accuracy (see table 3). 15 Curiously, the compositors' stints generally do not begin (or end) at the beginning of a new page or sheet. Instead, the compositors frequently change in mid-page, often at the beginning of a new scene or at an entrance direction for a character within a scene. The shift on signature C2r:24 comes at Enter with a diuell drest like a woman , with fier workes ; on C3v:31 at Enter Lucifer , Belsabub , and Mephostophilus ; on D1r:28 at Enter Faustus and Mephastophilus ; on D3r:9 at Enter Robin the Ostler with a booke in his hand ; on E3r:6 at Enter to them the Duke, and the Dutchess, the Duke speakes . As Bowers observes, "this practice is so consistent and so odd as to call for explanation" ( Complete Works , II.147). Welsh found evidence of type-shortages indicating that the compositors were setting seriatim, rather than by formes, and Bowers notes that this conclusion is supported by the nature of the stints which are not confined to formes. Welsh assumes that the two compositors worked chiefly in turn rather than simultaneously, each setting a scene of the text ("Printing," pp. 114-115). D. F. McKenzie claims that such a procedure for shared setting would have been normal in a seventeenth-century print shop: "normally, even when two or more compositors worked on a book, they did not work together setting sheet and sheet about. What usually happened was that one took over where the other left off." 16 So strong is McKenzie's insistence upon "a fairly accurate definition of 'normality'" that there can be little doubt that this was the way that compositors usually worked. However, the irregularity of the stints in Faustus is so unusual that we may be justified in inquiring as to the possibly abnormal circumstances in which they were produced. 17 Welsh concludes that only one type-case was in use because both compositors suffered shortages of black-letter W , and he imagines that two type-cases could not both contain an inadequate supply of this letter ("Printing," pp. 115-119). But Bowers points out that such W shortages were a congenital difficulty in French fonts and rightly observes that the question of whether the compositors were setting from one case or from two, in turns or simultaneously, can only be proven by a detailed analysis of identifiable broken types. However, "in the absence of more precise findings from the distribution and setting of identified types," Bowers assumes that the compositors were setting simultaneously. He then conjectures that the irregularity of the stints is most explicable if the compositors were setting from manuscript that had not been cast off but where arbitrary joins could be marked at readily identifiable points. It would follow almost by necessity that they were generally setting without thought of complete pages. Only after their galleys had been transferred to the imposing stone was the type divided into the proper pages, by formes, when the time came for imposition. This method is so unusual as to suggest that the copy was not an easy one to cast off for exact operation by two simultaneously setting compositors. ( Complete Works , II.146) If, as Bowers suggests, the printer's copy was a manuscript that was particularly difficult to cast off, it might well have been easier for the two compositors each to set individual scenes in their galleys, which could then be combined into pages during imposition. 18 Bowers's attractive and sensible conjecture has important ramifications for our understanding of the nature of the underlying copy that have not been previously realized. Compositors' stints are necessarily limited, and sometimes defined, by separable sections of the printer's copy. 19 If the compositors were setting simultaneously from separate cases, the copy itself would have to have been physically separated and divided between them. In order for each compositor to be given a successive scene from the manuscript copy, we would have to suppose that every fresh scene began on a new manuscript page. And Bowers himself elsewhere surmises that the only type of manuscript in which this might be true would be "the foul papers of a collaboration" ("The Text of Marlowe's Faustus ," p. 199). The issue of whether or not the compositors were working simultaneously on the A1 quarto can now be seen to have considerable implications. Simultaneous setting might point to the use of foul paper copy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Three decades ago, Charlton Hinman "noticed by chance" that what seemed to be the same damaged letter "m" appeared frequently in the Shakespeare First Folio. By examining the Folio under slight magnification, Hinman was able to identify 615 distinctively damaged pieces of type and to trace their 13,000 appearances throughout the Folio. Their patterns of recurrence allowed Hinman to identify the pairs of type-cases used by the Folio compositors. When identifiable types from B1r appeared only on Cr4 and types from B2v appeared only on C3v, for example, Hinman could demonstrate that two pairs of type-cases were being used: one into which B1r was distributed and from which C4r was set, and one into which B2v was distributed and from which C3v was set. This type-recurrence evidence supported the spelling evidence which indicated that Compositor A set C4r and Compositor C set C3v. "In such circumstances," Hinman concluded, "there can be no serious doubt that the two pages . . . were set simultaneously." 20 My investigation of the A1 quarto of Faustus followed Hinman's methods as modified by Blayney for application to quarto texts (see Texts , pp. 93-94). I examined the unique Bodleian copy of A1, type by type, under 7x magnification with a calibrated lens. Each type that differed in any significant respect from the usual appearance of that character was noted on a photocopy facsimile. 2250 types were so marked. I then examined each sort individually and rejected as evidence most of the types originally marked, usually because, as Hinman discovered, certain sorts are often similarly damaged because they are especially vulnerable to a particular kind of injury; identical injuries in several types are useless for identifying individual types. The blackletter font used to print Faustus , which was hardly fresh in appearance when Simmes first used it in 1594, had, in the intervening decade, been used for at least twenty-seven books. 21 By the time Faustus was printed, the font was old and battered: letters in which a vertical joins a curve (b, d, h, m, n, p, q, r, u) are almost all damaged at the join; ascenders and descenders (b, d, h, l, k, p, q,) are frequently bent or broken. Nearly every letter has a nick, chip, bend, break or bite (though not necessarily a distinctive one). 22 Nevertheless I found sufficiently distinctive damage to allow for accurate identification of 599 individual types and made a sketch of each, recording the position of its initial appearance along with any subsequent appearances. I then repeated the examination of the entire quarto, type by type, in order to ensure that no appearances of the 599 distinctive types had been overlooked. The result was 89 appearances made by 37 types (listed in Appendix I). Although 37 recurring types out of a possible 599 is a surprisingly low number, it should be stressed that because A1 survives in only one copy a type-recurrence study is inherently limited in its ability to gather large amounts of reliable evidence. 23 Hinman noticed that some identifiable type defects are liable to be inked over occasionally, so that a distinctive type might be unrecognizable in some copies, and he concluded that a "thorough investigation will certainly require the use of more than one copy" ( Printing and Proof-Reading , I.55). When Blayney compared the damaged types he had identified in the Bodleian copy of Q1 Lear with those in the Trinity College copy, he found that more than a thousand supposedly damaged types were, in fact, simply inking flaws ( Texts , p. 95). And Blayney has been criticized because he did not examine more of the extant copies. In similar studies, Anthony Hammond found it necessary to consult ten copies of Q1 The White Devil and Paul Werstine examined all of the extant copies of Q1 Love's Labour's Lost . 24 Unfortunately, such comparison and cross-checking is impossible with A1 Faustus because the Bodleian copy is unique. The difficulty is felt even more keenly because of the uneven inking of the extant copy. On several pages the inking is quite heavy (A4r, B1r, B3r), and consequently some identifiable type damage may have been inked over. Conversely, on other pages the inking is so faint that there are sections of text (B3v:21-35, C3r:33-37, D3r:1-10, and E3v:29-34 are prime examples) in which what may be actual type damage cannot possibly be distinguished from mere inking flaws. I have no doubt that many distinctive types have chosen these pages on which to make their only reappearance, but, short of discovering a better inked copy of A1, there is no way to trace them. Blayney, who rightly argues for greater rigor in type-recurrence studies of quarto texts, has shown that a large quantity of evidence—certainly more than 5 or 6 types per page—is necessary in order "to allow the page-order of a quarto to be determined with any great precision" ( Texts , p. 91). Given that the "evidence-density" of recurring types in the pages of Faustus is relatively low, it would be foolish to try to prove the order in which the pages were set, and I have not attempted to do so. Despite their limited numbers, however, the recurring types do form clear patterns from which several general conclusions regarding distribution may be drawn. The black-letter font was apparently large enough to enable two entire gatherings (four formes) to be in type at the same time. Types from sheet A do not reappear until sheet C; types from B not until D; from C not until E; and from D not until F. It is reasonable to deduce that A did not need to be distributed until C was set; B not until D was set; C not until E; and D not until F (see Distribution Tables in Appendix II). But because the only identifiable type from outer D appearing in sheet F is a capital "W" (W3), which may simply have been cannibalized from the margin of an undistributed page, we have no evidence that outer D was necessarily distributed. Thus, the relatively large type supply meant that only seven formes needed to be distributed during the printing of this relatively short quarto. 25 This type-recurrence study was undertaken primarily to determine whether or not the two compositors were setting simultaneously. The type evidence, minimal though it is, seems to point to the use of two separate pairs of type-cases. Twenty-two identifiable types from sheet C reappear for the first time in sheet E. Types last seen on C1r and C4v appear only on the pages of E set by Compositor X . Types from C2v, C3r, C3v, C4r appear only on the pages of E set by Compositor Y (see table 4). Apparently, C1r and C4v were distributed into one pair of type-cases from which X set E2v, E3v(lower), and E4r; while C2v, C3r, C3v, and C4r were distributed into another pair of cases from which Y set E1r, E1v, E3r(lower), E3v(upper), and E4v(lower). Hinman observed that, in the Shakespeare Folio, "a compositor would ordinarily distribute pages which he had himself set before he distributed material set by someone else" ( Printing and Proof-Reading , I.124). Indeed, Compositor X is here found distributing the Faustus pages that he had set (he was responsible for all of C1r and most of C4v), while Y is found distributing the pages that he had set (all of C2v, most of C3r, some of C3v, and all of C4r). Compositor Y distributed two pages from the inner forme of C and two pages from the outer forme into his own case. The sudden influx of types from inner C on E3r suggests that the inner forme was distributed sometime after Y set E1r and E1v and before he began on E3r. In addition to distributing C1r and C4v of the outer forme, Compositor X may have distributed C1v and C2r of the inner forme as well (both of which he had set) although no identifiable types from these pages recur. The evidence that two pairs of type-cases were in use does not, in itself, prove simultaneous setting by two compositors. Theoretically, the same compositor could set one page of a forme from one case and then another page from another case. However, the combined evidence of distinctive compositorial patterns of spelling-punctuation and the recurrence of identifiable types may be taken as proof of simultaneous setting. For while there would have been little point in employing two compositors, each working at his own type case, alternately to set pages and part-pages for the same forme, simultaneous setting, as Hinman points out, "would have secured the very important advantage of speeding up composition in relation to presswork" ( Printing and Proof-Reading , I.109). It would appear, then, that Compositor X and Compositor Y , working from two pairs of type-cases, set the text of Faustus simultaneously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV We are now in a position to consider the probable nature of the printer's copy for the A1 quarto. In order for Compositor X to be able to set the end of Act IV scene i at his pair of type-cases while Y simultaneously set the beginning of the next scene at his (as they did for E3r), each would need to have had the copy for his scene at his own case, probably held by a visorum. 26 Apparently, the manuscript leaf that contained the end of IV.i was physically separable from the leaf on which the beginning of IV.ii was written. That this division of copy between the two compositors was possible throughout the setting of A1 suggests that every fresh scene in the manuscript began on a new page. Bowers (discussing Faustus in another text and context) asserts that he knows of "no preserved dramatic manuscript which does this" but adds that "it might well be a convenience for the foul papers of a collaboration" ("The Text of Marlowe's Faustus ," p. 199). In fact, in the only preserved example of the foul papers of a collaboration, The Book of Sir Thomas More (B.L. MS Harl. 7368), three of the scenes written by the collaborating playwrights do begin on new pages (see fol. 7v, 8r, 12r). Another manuscript that may have some application here as well is the fragment of The Massacre at Paris . This manuscript leaf, now in the Folger Shakespeare Library (MS J.b.8), may be in Marlowe's own hand, and, if so, it is one of the few preserved examples of a playwright's foul papers. 27 The approximately 7" X 8" manuscript leaf contains exactly one scene of the play, beginning with Enter at the top of the recto, and ending with Exeunt halfway down the verso; the rest of the page is left blank. If the leaf is genuine then we may have evidence that Marlowe's method of composition was to begin and end individual scenes on separate pieces of paper. There are, however, enough doubts about the authenticity of the leaf that any such conclusions can only be tentative. Whatever Marlowe's practice when he was writing alone, it is generally agreed that Doctor Faustus was something of a collaborative effort, and a collaboration might necessarily entail special methods of composition. Before speculating further about the nature of the manuscript (or manuscripts) that the collaborating playwrights produced, we need to consider how that collaboration may have progressed. Specifically, was the writing of Faustus an interactive collaboration, or did the collaborator merely inherit a play that Marlowe had left unfinished? 28 Greg contends that Marlowe "planned the whole" and farmed out certain scenes to another dramatist, but Roma Gill speculates that Marlowe's "encounter at Depford brought his writing of Dr. Faustus to an untimely end" so that the actors were left with "the beginning and end of a great tragedy, and the problem of how to bridge the twenty-four years." 29 Although Gill's conjecture has a certain attraction, it does not account for inconsistencies in the text that seem to point instead to a collaboration in which the two dramatists were writing their scenes separately and simultaneously. For it appears that the collaborator was, to a certain extent, unfamiliar with Marlowe's section of the play. Indeed, to speak of Renaissance dramatic "collaboration" may be something of a misnomer, because playwrights who worked together on a play generally worked apart. Rather than a line-by-line collaboration (such as that employed by the twentieth-century team of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart), the usual division of labor was the separate composition of individual acts and scenes. 30 Writing in relative isolation, one collaborator would often not know exactly what the other was doing: Shakespeare was using a different source for his share of The Two Noble Kinsmen than Fletcher was using for his. 31 Nashe, who wrote only the induction and first act of The Isle of Dogs , complains that Ben Jonson, who wrote the other four acts, did not have "the least guess of my drift or scope." 32 In Shakespeare's additional scene for More , he seems unaware of both the original version of the play and the revisions made by his fellow collaborators. 33 Tucker Brooke was the first to point out that the author of Mephistopheles's complaint in the Faustus scene with the clowns—"How am I vexèd with these villains' charms! / From Constantinople am I hither come / Only for pleasure of these damnèd slaves" (III.ii.33-35)—contradicts Marlowe's conception of the effects of conjuring at I.iii.43-57, where Mephistopheles explains that he was not "raised" by Faustus's conjuring speeches but came of his "own accord." 34 Greg, while noting that we need not expect the philosophical outlook of the serious scenes to be maintained in the farcical scenes, agrees that this contradiction "may legitimately be cited as confirmation of the manifest difference of authorship" ( Parallel Texts , p. 360). Moreover, it has not been previously noticed that two of the collaborator's scenes refer to specific incidents from the prose History of the Damnable Life and Deserved Death of Doctor John Faustus (1592) that do not appear in the play. At the end of the Show of Sins scene, Lucifer promises to send for Faustus at midnight for a visit to hell (II.ii.171). The promised trip to hell takes place in the Damnable Life (chap. 20), but not in the play. 35 In the collaborator's Robin and Rafe scene, Mephistopheles says that he has come "from Constantinople" (III.ii.34). Although an important episode takes place in Constantinople in the Damnable Life (chap. 22), there is no corresponding scene in the play. Apparently, the collaborator assumed that the play, like its source, would include both a scene of Faustus's visit to hell and a scene at Constantinople. If the collaborator was given a copy of the Damnable Life from which to dramatize certain scenes (i.e. the scene at Rome [chap. 22], the scene at the Emperor's court [chap. 29-30], the Horsecorser episode [chap. 34], the scene at Vanholt [chap. 39]), but was unaware of exactly what other material from the source Marlowe was incorporating into his share of the play, the inconsistencies in the collaborative text might easily have resulted. 36 It would make sense, or, as Bowers says, it would be a "convenience" for a collaborating playwright to begin each of his scenes on a new page so that they could later be collated with those of his collaborator (as appears to have been the case in the collaborative revision of The Book of Sir Thomas More ). Such a supposition, which may seem sufficiently obvious, is corroborated by Thomas Dekker's testimony that playwrights conceived of collaboration in terms of writing separate acts on separate pieces of paper. In a libel suit brought by Benjamin Garfield over the portrayal of his mother-in-law in the subplot of Keep the Widow Waking , Dekker asserts that he only "wrote two sheets of paper containing the first act" (Bentley, p. 233). It is reasonable to suppose that Marlowe and his collaborator proceeded in this fashion. Presumably, their separate foul papers would then be combined and, perhaps after some stitching and reworking, a fair copy would be transcribed (either to be used as or preparatory to the promptbook). In such a transcript the scenes would follow one after the other, with no necessary relation to the beginning or end of the pages on which they were written. Bowers is essentially correct in that there is no extant fair copy dramatic manuscript in which every fresh scene begins on a new page, but we might expect new scenes to begin on new pages in the foul papers of a collaboration. I would suggest, then, that the printers of A1 Faustus had as their copy the original foul papers of Marlowe and his collaborator. 37 A certain amount of shuffling and reshuffling of the combined papers might have occurred when they were first transcribed or during the more than a decade that they spent in storage; such a manuscript would have been anything but orderly, and we would not be surprised to find certain scenes out of place in a text that was printed from it. And, indeed, it has long been suspected that the two Robin/Rafe scenes, which follow one immediately after the other, are not in their proper positions; the Act IV Chorus, which is obviously intended to introduce the Carolus scene but comes two scenes too early in A1, is certainly misplaced. This type of manuscript, in which Marlowe's scenes could be easily separated from those of his collaborator, would have facilitated the unusual method of composition found in the A1 quarto: it would allow one compositor to set a scene (Marlowe's) while another simultaneously set the following scene (collaborator's). This hypothesis gains considerable strength when we compare the compositors' stints with the shares of the play that have been traditionally assigned to Marlowe and to his collaborator. Compositor changes often coincide with authorship changes: on D1r, Y set Wagner's chorus (Marlowe's), while X set the beginning of the scene at Rome (collaborator's); on D3r, X set the chorus (Marlowe's), while Y set the beginning of the Robin and Rafe scene (collaborator's). The compositors are here able to divide up their copy at the exact points at which authorship changes. This textual feature can perhaps best be explained if the copy that they had to work with was the foul papers of the two playwrights. 38</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V In the winter of 1600-01, four plays from the repertoire of Philip Henslowe's company, the Admiral's Men, found their way to London publishers: The Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntingdon, The Death of Robert Earl of Huntingdon, Look About You , and The Shoemakers' Holiday . In each case, Henslowe appears to have sold the dramatists' foul papers. 39 This suggests a course of events in which the playwrights delivered their foul paper manuscripts to the company, that they were then transcribed for the purpose of the promptbook, and that the originals thus superseded were in due course released for publication. In January of 1601, the publisher Thomas Bushell came into possession of another Admiral's play: Doctor Faustus . The body of evidence presented in this essay is incompatible with the commonly held view that Bushell was given a memorially reconstructed version of the play. Instead, we now have reason to believe that the manuscript that Bushell had acquired, and that Valentine Simmes would subsequently print, was the original foul papers of Marlowe and his collaborator.</field>

See W. Craig Ferguson's chapter on "Shared Printing" in Valentine Simmes, Printer to Drayton, Shakespeare et al.

Compositor " B " was first identified by Ferguson as A 's partner in Q2 of The Contention ("The Compositors of Henry IV , etc.," p. 25). Craven, after deciding that "there can be no doubt that Compositor A set all of The Contention ," took the freed-up letter " B " and applied it to the second compositor of The Shoemakers' Holiday , noting that "Ferguson does not call the alternate compositor Compositor B " ("Two Valentine Simmes Compositors," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 67 (1973), 161-171, esp. 163, 166). However, Craven is mistaken: Ferguson does suggest, in the last word of his article, that the second Shoemaker compositor is " B ". 15 I have conducted an independent compositor analysis, and my assignment of compositorial shares differs in minor respects from both Welsh's and Bowers's (cf. Complete Works , II.145). 16 "Printers of the Mind: Some Notes on Bibliographical Theories and Printing-house Practices," Studies in Bibliography , 22 (1969), 1-75, esp. 18. 17 I have been able to find only one other instance in Renaissance dramatic texts in which a compositor's stint begins and ends in mid-page, corresponding to the beginning and ending of a scene. In Q1 Lear , Blayney's compositor C 's stint begins at the opening stage direction of IV.iii (sig. H4v18) and probably ends with the last line of IV.iv (sig. I1v25). But, as Blayney notes, "there is absolutely no reason why stints and scenes should coincide" ( Texts , p. 158). See also note 38 below. 18 This does not, of course, mean that it must therefore have been the playwrights' foul papers. Presumably, the holograph manuscript of a reporter's memorial reconstruction (which is what Bowers has in mind) could be equally foul. In context, Bowers is here refuting Greg's suggestion that the 1604 quarto may be a mere reprint of a lost 1601 edition. He offers this bibliographical evidence as a proof that A1 "was composed from manuscript and hence that it is the true first edition" ( Complete Works , II.147). 19 In Q1 Lear , Blayney's Compositor C set H4v18-I1v25 and Compositor B set H3r26-4v17, apparently simultaneously. Blayney argues that the section of the copy that C was given "was probably the first physically separable sheet or leaf of the copy following that on which the first compositor was already working" ( Texts , p. 127). 20 The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare , 2 vols. (1963), I.56, 109. 21 Ferguson lists the dates and Short Title Catalogue numbers for each appearance of the font ( Valentine Simmes , p. 43): 1594 : STC 709, 22860; 1595 : 4042, 4101, 4102, 15638, 23361; 1596 : 720, 1053, 1829, 13252, 14802, 15281, 17126.1, 20297, 23362; 1597 : 15379; 1598 : 12099; 1599 : 25089; 1600 : 6523, 6798, 21466; 1601 : 18893, 18894, 19343; 1602 : 26026; 1603 : 14377; 1604 : 17429 [ Faustus ]. Although Ferguson asserts that Simmes had a "Black Letter 1a" font that was also used in 1594-96 and not after, he apparently does not distinguish between this font and Simmes's other 82 mm black-letter font "B.L.1b" in the above list. For a critique of some aspects of Ferguson's typographic scholarship see Adrian Weiss's review of Ferguson's Pica Roman Type in Elizabethan England (1989) in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 83 (1989), 539-546. 22 In his seminal study of font analysis and type recognition, Adrian Weiss observes that "routine battering and the beating of the type into place in the chase during locking-up of the forme wreaked havoc with lower-case letters" and he provides a useful survey of the typical damage sustained by pica roman sorts. See "Font Analysis as a Bibliographical Method: The Elizabethan Play-Quarto Printers and Compositors," Studies in Bibliography , 43 (1990), 95-164, esp. 116. 23 Some type-recurrence investigators do not weed out from their final results identifications about which they are uncertain. Hammond's final count for Q1 of The White Devil , for example, includes types from four levels of (un)certainty (" The White Devil in Nicholas Okes's Shop," Studies in Bibliography , 39 (1986), 135-172, esp. 170n). Although I considered amplifying my results by including such doubtful identifications, it ultimately seemed preferable to have a small amount of reliable data rather than a slightly larger amount that was untrustworthy. 24 See Hammond, review of Blayney's Texts in The Library , 6th ser., 6 (1984), 91-92; Hammond, " The White Devil in Nicholas Okes's Shop," p. 159; Werstine, review of Blayney's Texts in Shakespeare Quarterly , 36 (1985), 121-125; Werstine, "The Editorial Usefulness of Printing House and Compositor Studies," in Play-Texts in Old Spelling: Papers from the Glendon Conference , eds. G. B. Shand and Raymond Shady (1984), pp. 35-64. 25 With only six gatherings, A1 Faustus is easily one of the shortest play quartos printed in the Renaissance; even the severely truncated first quarto of Hamlet (1603), also printed by Simmes, with nine gatherings, is twenty-six pages longer. 26 See Joseph Moxon's description of the compositor's use of visorums in Mechanick Exercises on the Whole Art of Printing (1683-4) , eds. Herbert Davis and Harry Carter (1958), p. 204. 27 The authenticity of the manuscript has been argued for, on paleographic and literary grounds, by J. Q. Adams, " The Massacre at Paris Leaf," The Library , 4th ser., 14 (1934), 447-469, and J. M. Nosworthy, "The Marlowe Manuscript," The Library , 4th ser., 26 (1946), 158-171. In his Revels edition of Dido and The Massacre at Paris , H. J. Oliver makes use of the manuscript leaf in order to determine "Marlowe's mannerisms" and attempts (unsuccessfully) to find these in the printed text of Dido (1968, pp. xxiv, lviii). In 1973, Bowers claimed that "early doubts about the authenticity of the manuscript of this brief scene are no longer raised" ( Complete Works , I.358). In the following year, however, after comparing the leaf with Marlowe's signature on the will of Katherin Benchkin, R. E. Alton denied the Massacre manuscript holograph status ( TLS , 26 April 1974). Anthony G. Petti also expresses doubts on paleographic grounds ( English Literary Hands from Chaucer to Dryden [1977], p. 85). 28 A similar difficulty is presented by the co-authorship of Hero and Leander . The title-page of Paul Linley's 1598 edition asserts that the poem was "Begun by Christopher Marloe; and finished by George Chapman." In a passage in the third sestiad (lines 183-198), Chapman apparently alludes to his reasons for concluding the poem, and makes a veiled reference to Marlowe's "late desires" (III.195), from which Tucker Brooke concludes that "Chapman's conclusion was undertaken by the authority of Marlowe himself" ( The Works of Christopher Marlowe [1910], p. 486). Conversely, Millar Maclure asserts that "we are not to suppose that Marlowe asked Chapman to finish the poem; rather that he would naturally wish to finish it himself" ( Christopher Marlowe, The Poems [Revels, 1968], p. 52n). 29 Greg, "The Damnation of Faustus," Modern Language Review , 41 (1946), 97-107, esp. 99; Gill, "'Such Conceits as Clownage Keeps in Pay'—Comedy and Dr. Faustus ," in The Fool and the Trickster , ed. Paul V. A. Williams (1979), pp. 55-63, esp. p. 56. 30 See G. E. Bentley, The Profession of Dramatist in Shakespeare's Time (1971), p. 228. 31 The two authors apparently learned the name of the character Pirithous from different sources. In Shakespeare's share of the play, the name is trisyllabic and spelled Pirithous (the spelling in North's Plutarch); in Fletcher's share, it has four syllables and is spelled Perithous (the spelling in Chaucer's Knight's Tale ). See G. R. Proudfoot's introduction to his Regents Renaissance Drama edition (1970), p. xix. 32 The Works of Thomas Nashe , ed. R. B. McKerrow, 5 vols. (1904-10), III.154. 33 See Giorgio Melchiori, "Hand D in Sir Thomas More : An Essay in Misinterpretation," Shakespeare Survey , 38 (1985), 112; see also Gary Taylor, William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion (1987), p. 461. 34 All act-scene-line numbers refer to those in the forthcoming Revels edition of the A-text. 35 A similar inconsistency, possibly caused by dual authorship, appears in Timon of Athens where the interview between Flavius and Ventidius that is arranged at the end of II.ii never materializes. See Taylor, William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion , p. 501. 36 It appears that the collaborator did, however, have access to Marlowe's two internal choruses; he appropriates a line from the first—"And take some part of holy Peter's feast" (III.Chorus.10)—verbatim for his scene at Rome (III.i.51). Before drafting the choruses, Marlowe seems to have skimmed through the Damnable Life , choosing incidents from the Faust legend that could be used for the middle of his play. Marlowe's review of the source appears to have been no more than cursory, and at times he merely versifies the chapter headings from the Damnable Life : "A question put foorth to Doctor Faustus, concerning the Starres. Chapt. 25." becomes "They put forth questions of astrology" (IV.Chorus.9). If it was Marlowe who planned the basic outline of the play, we might speculate that he provided his collaborator with these two choruses early on, one introducing the scene at Rome and one the scene with the emperor Carolus, as both a guide to and preliminary material for those scenes from the Damnable Life that he wanted dramatized. 37 In the printer's dedication "To the Gentlemen Readers" of Tamburlaine , Richard Jones claims that he has intentionally omitted what seem to have been comic or farcical scenes that were not germane to Marlowe's tragic scenes. These omitted scenes may have been written by a collaborator. Bowers suggests that the printer's copy that Jones had acquired did not contain these scenes and "hence his virtuous defense of the omission of unsuitable scenes may very possibly be an attempt to anticipate criticism that they were not present, though acted" ( Complete Works , I.75). 38 Similarly, in the Folio text of I Henry VI , which Gary Taylor has recently argued was set from collaborative foul papers, one mid-page compositor change coincides exactly with an apparent change in authorship: while Compositor A set the conclusion of the first act (which, Taylor argues, was written by Nashe) for sig. K5r from type case x, Compositor B was simultaneously setting the beginning of Act Two (which, Taylor argues, was written by another, as-yet unidentified playwright) for the same page from case y ("Shakespeare and Others: the Authorship of I Henry VI," Medieval and Renaissance Drama in England , forthcoming). 39 See John C.

      <field name="heading_text">Rhyming in Pericles : More Evidence of Dual Authorship by MacD. P. Jackson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pericles was first published in a quarto of 1609, which attributed the play to William Shakespeare and claimed that it had been "divers and sundry times acted by his Majesty's Servants at the Globe." Scholars agree that the quarto, on which modern editions must be based, provides an imperfect text, though there has been disagreement about the extent and nature of the corruption. The majority view is that it is a "bad quarto," printed from an unauthorized manuscript, which may have been concocted largely from memory. But the quarto's textual imperfections are not so drastic as to obscure a stylistic disparity between the play's first two and last three acts. The second part of Pericles is unmistakably Shakespearian; the first part is not. 1 Several theories have been advanced to account for this state of affairs. It has been suggested that the circumstances of the text's transmission may have produced the disjunction in style, two different "reporters" having reconstructed the two parts of the play. 2 Another hypothesis is that acts 1 and 2 of Pericles are vestiges of an early Shakespearian play that the mature dramatist thoroughly revised over acts 3-5, or that Shakespeare wrote acts 1 and 2 at the beginning of his career and failed to finish the play until around 1606-1607. 3 Other commentators have supposed that Shakespeare wrote the whole of Pericles within a single period but that he deliberately made the first two acts odd for some special artistic purpose. 4 The choruses, in which the resurrected medieval poet John Gower furnishes narrative links in the dramatization of a story for which his Confessio Amantis served as a significant source, are composed in couplets imitative of the real Gower, and the suggestion is that the play's dialogue may have been consciously adjusted to the choruses' apt archaism. There is also a group of modern critics who seem almost oblivious to the difference between the stilted verse of Pericles 1-2 and the vigorous poetry of Pericles 3-5. But the most common view has been that the first portion of the play was written by another playwright—that Shakespeare either reworked the second half of the other man's play, or completed his unfinished play, or collaborated with him. 5 No other play generally accepted as wholly Shakespeare's was excluded from the First Folio of 1623. So the failure of Pericles to appear in that volume tells strongly in favour of the theory of divided authorship. 6 The leading candidate for the role of non-Shakespearian contributor to Pericles has long been the minor dramatist George Wilkins, whose one independent play, The Miseries of Enforced Marriage , was published two years before Pericles , with a title page claiming that it had been acted by Shakespeare's company, the King's Men; over the last twenty years or so some quite substantial evidence has accumulated in support of Wilkins's authorship of Pericles 1-2. 7 The purpose of this paper is to add some more. Among the most valuable contributions to the case for Wilkins's participation in Pericles is David J. Lake's investigation of the play's rhymes. There are 145 rhymes within acts 1-2 of Pericles and 128 within acts 3-5. Lake offers a mass of data demonstrating that certain features of the rhymes in Pericles 1-2 associate this portion of the play much more closely with the known verse of Wilkins than with the acknowledged verse of Shakespeare or with work by any of the alternative candidates for the role of Shakespeare's collaborator in Pericles , namely John Day, William Rowley, and Thomas Heywood. 8 The most important of these features are the prevalence of assonantal near-rhymes, especially those involving nasal consonants; the use of a high proportion of rhymes with a short vowel plus stop-consonant; and the frequent use of an "aabcc" rhyme pattern and of sporadic outbursts of couplets surrounded by blank verse. Lake gives figures for the rates of occurrence of these features within Pericles and plays by various playwrights. He also lists a few individual rhymes shared by Miseries and Pericles 1-2, and mentions that H. Dugdale Sykes had noted several such specific rhyme-word links as long ago as 1919. 9 But the investigation of individual rhymes, rather than types of rhyme, can be carried a good deal further. 10 My procedure was first to compile a list of all the rhymes in Pericles and in The Miseries of Enforced Marriage . 11 The texts were scanned carefully from beginning to end and rhyme words were keyed into a computer in alphabetically arranged pairs: breath|death, ill|will, life|wife , and so on. Those from Miseries were tagged with an extra final symbol so that they could be identified as coming from that source play, not from Pericles . The order in which a rhyme's components appeared within the text— ill followed by will , or will followed by ill —was regarded as irrelevant. This holds for every phase of the investigation reported in this paper. The majority of rhymes were in couplets. When three consecutive lines rhymed (as in " away . . . stay . . . day "), three rhyme pairs were recorded: away|day, away|stay , and day|stay . Similarly a sequence of four lines rhyming on a single sound would produce six rhyme pairs. Thus " die . . . testify . . . eye . . . justify " yields die|eye, die|justify, die|testify, eye|justify, eye|testify, justify|testify . There were very few cases in which there could be doubt over whether a rhyme was intentional or accidental. Imperfect rhymes were included when they occurred within a rhymed context or in places, such as gnomic lines or ends of speeches, where rhyme might be expected. The Micro-OCP concordance programme was then used to generate an alphabetical list of all the rhyme pairs and to tally the number of occurrences of each in Pericles and in Miseries . As rhymes from both plays were printed in the one list, with the total of ill|will , for example, in Pericles being followed by the total of ill|will in Miseries , shared rhymes were visible almost at a glance. A list of rhymes shared by Pericles and Miseries is given in Table 1, which also shows the number of occurrences of these rhymes in each play and provides the Pericles line references. Where links are recorded the rhyme words appear in exactly the same form in each play, except that in Pericles the plural or verbal - s ending occurs in beds|heads , debts/gets , and swears|tears and the last rhyme listed is in the form thrived|wived . My intention was to treat - s endings, whether plurals or verbal inflexions, as equivalent to the root form, but to regard prefixes, suffixes, and more complex inflexions as establishing separate rhyme words. The reason for the slight relaxation of this rule in the case of thrives|wives or thrived|wived will be explained shortly. There were no other cases where relaxation of the rule would have produced additional links. It is immediately obvious that although the total number of rhymes in Pericles 1-2 is not much larger than the total number of rhymes in Pericles 3-5, it is within acts 1-2 that the great majority of rhyme links with Miseries fall. Twenty-six of the Pericles line references are to the first two acts, only six to the last three. Also noticeable is that the two rhymes that occur most frequently in Miseries —and they are easily the most frequent not only in the list of shared rhymes but in Miseries as a whole—are also the only two shared rhymes that occur as often as three times in Pericles . But in order to determine the significance of the links with Miseries we need data concerning rhymes in all Shakespeare's works. The necessary information is available in Helge Kökeritz's Shakespeare's Pronunciation (1953), which ends with an index to all the rhymes in Shakespeare's collected works, including The Two Noble Kinsmen and the largely spurious miscellany The Passionate Pilgrim . From Kökeritz's index it is clear that three of the rhyme pairs common to Miseries and Pericles occur nowhere else in the Shakespeare canon. These are consist|resist, him|sin , and impudence|offence. Fears|years is paralleled only by fear|half year in I Henry IV , 4.1.136, tears/years only by Venus and Adonis , 1091, both|oath only by The Rape of Lucrece , 569, and awe|law only by Richard III , 5.3.312; and the index records only two further instances of bed|wed, bring|sing , and do|you . Even examples of ill|will and life|wife are far from numerous: outside Pericles there are eleven of each. However, a just assessment of the presence in Pericles 1-2 of so many rhymes that are also found in Miseries requires comparisons between Miseries and all Shakespeare's works. I therefore consulted Kökeritz's comprehensive inventory for citations of each individual rhyme in my alphabetical list of rhymes in Miseries so as to obtain counts of the links with the various Shakespearian plays and poems. "Links" were counted not merely in terms of the presence of a rhyme in both Miseries and the Shakespearian work but in terms of the number of occurrences of the rhyme in each work. Thus, to illustrate from the data in Table 1, since all|call appears once in Pericles and twice in Miseries , two links are recorded, and since die|eye appears twice in Pericles and once in Miseries two links are recorded. The rhyme him|sin appears twice in each play, and so yields four links, while ill|will , which occurs three times in Pericles and six times in Miseries , yields as many as eighteen links. The same principles were used in calculating links with each play and poem. Kökeritz normally groups minor inflexional and derivative forms with their basic words, agree(d,-s,-ing) rhyming not only with be|me , etc., but also with bleed, sees, seeing , and abhor (thee) rhyming with more, for thee , and adore thee . Thus a single head word thrive(d,-th) includes rhymes with thrive , such as thrive|wive in Twelfth Night , and rhymes with thriveth and thrived , such as thrived|wived in Pericles . However, when a rhyme word is exceedingly common, as are die and eye , Kökeritz gives a separate head word to even the - s plural or verbal inflexion, dies and eyes . In such cases I differentiated between die|eye rhymes and dies|eyes rhymes. In practice, it matters little what rules-of-thumb one adopts. The word kiss , for example, is given the head kiss(ed,-es,-ing, you) , but the inflexions and the feminine rhyme with you are irrelevant to kiss|this and to most of the other examples. In the large majority of cases, "links" implied exact equivalence of the rhyme words, and most of the few exceptions involved the simple - s ending. It was easy enough to preserve Kökeritz's separate categorization of such homophones as knight and night , somewhat more difficult to be sure of consistently maintaining his distinctions between such different words as the verb and the noun tear . Again, multiple rhymes were broken down into their components, so that triple rhyme yielded three rhyme pairs, a series of four rhyming lines (whether consecutive or part of a more complex pattern) yielded six rhyme pairs, a string of five rhyming lines yielded ten rhyme pairs, and so on. When a particular rhyme word appeared twice or thrice within such a sequence calculations were made as though it appeared only once. Thus " holly . . . folly . . . holly . . . jolly " was taken as creating three rhyme pairs, not six. Two attempts to extract the relevant information, made over a year apart, resulted in sets of figures that were identical for most works and so closely similar for others that errors or inconsistencies in the application of my criteria must have been few and of no practical consequence. Once we have figures for the number of rhyme links between George Wilkins's The Miseries of Enforced Marriage and each one of Shakespeare's plays and poems, we still need to calculate how frequent these links are in proportion to the number of possible links , that is to the total number of rhymes in each Shakespearian work. Unfortunately, it is not possible to use ready-made tallies of Shakespeare's rhymed lines, such as those presented in the metrical tables appended to the second volume of E. K. Chambers's William Shakespeare (1930) or those given by Frederic William Ness in The Use of Rhyme in Shakespeare's Plays (1941). Ness's totals are often seriously at variance with Chambers's, which themselves result from Chambers's efforts to correct the tables of F. G. Fleay. Chambers's main table excludes "external" verses—prologues, epilogues, choruses, interludes, masques, Pistol's bombast, and the Mousetrap play within Hamlet , and it is not perfectly clear whether his supplementary figures are intended to make good all these omissions. More importantly, a simple halving of the number of rhymed lines in a play will not give the number of rhyme pairs, for the reasons indicated above. The Fool's jingle in King Lear , 1.4.131-136—" goest . . . showest . . . knowest . . . owest . . . trowest . . . throwest "—creates fifteen rhyme pairs. The three "b" lines in The Rape of Lucrece 's ababbcc stanzas create three rhyme pairs, so that each seven-line stanza yields five rhymes. It was therefore necessary to produce new figures for the number of rhymes in each Shakespearian play and poem by working systematically through Kökeritz's one hundred page inventory, and marking each example of a rhyme on graph paper in which the various Shakespearian titles were allotted separate columns. This proved a tedious and tricky task. It takes a while to familiarize oneself with the organization of Kökeritz's index. References to all instances of above|love , for example, are given under the head word above ; later, under the head word love , the rhyme above is listed, but the references are not repeated. However, references for multiple rhymes (" fight . . . sprite . . . night ") and for especially unusual rhymes ( am|Tom ) are sometimes given under the later alphabetical head or heads as well. So it requires vigilance to avoid counting some instances of a rhyme twice. Kökeritz, who comments on the inaccuracy of Ness's statistics, seems to have been careful himself, and he is much more cautious about admitting rhymes as intentional, though he includes some doubtful examples, marking them with an asterisk. I included these few doubtful examples in my counts. But I excluded rhymes peculiar to bad quarto texts, ignoring all those that Kökeritz marks with a Q, except those from King Lear and the single example from Richard II . As a check on the accuracy of my counts, I calculated directly the number of rhymes in the Sonnets, A Lover's Complaint, Venus and Adonis , and The Rape of Lucrece . The Sonnets consist of 154 sonnets, each with seven rhymes, except that Sonnet 126 is a tail-piece with twelve lines and six rhymes and Sonnet 99 has an extra line connected with the opening quatrain and so yields nine rhymes. This gives 1079 rhymes. The total I compiled from Kökeritz's inventory was 1075. Kökeritz is responsible for at least part of this discrepancy. He has omitted the headword truth and so has no reference for the truth|youth rhyme in Sonnet 138, though he includes the rhyme (without reference) under the headword youth. A Lover's Complaint has 47 stanzas rhyming ababbcc, giving five rhymes in each and 235 overall. My total, compiled from Kökeritz's inventory, was 242. Venus and Adonis has 199 stanzas rhyming ababcc. This gives 597 rhymes, compared to my total of 603. The Rape of Lucrece has 265 stanzas, each with five rhymes. This gives 1325 rhymes altogether, compared to my total of 1338. Presumably my counts for the three narrative poems accidentally included some rhymes twice, though Kökeritz's index may itself contain pertinent minor mistakes. I corrected my original tallies for the poems in accord with the later calculations, but the main point of these checks was to provide assurance that the processing of the data available in Kökeritz's inventory had been tolerably reliable. We can reckon on a margin of error of not much more than 1.0 per cent. My total for the much shorter The Phoenix and Turtle proved exactly right. The poem contains thirteen quatrains (abab), followed by five rhymed tercets, but in one of these the lines end " be . . . she . . . be ", giving one rhyme rather than three. The total of 39 rhymes agrees with the figure extracted from Kökeritz's data. An additional step in the investigation was to compile, with the help of Micro-OCP, an alphabetical list of all the rhymes in those sections of The Travels of the Three English Brothers which have been assigned to George Wilkins. 12 The play, another belonging to the King's Men, was printed in 1607 with a dedicatory preface to which were appended the names of John Day, William Rowley, and George Wilkins, and there has been a fair measure of agreement among scholars upon which scenes were composed by Wilkins. The list of Travels rhymes was then compared with the list of Miseries rhymes, so that the number of links could be ascertained. Travels was thus treated like each of Shakespeare's works, in that the proportion of its rhymes that were shared with Miseries was calculated. Table 2 presents for each Shakespearian work and for Wilkins's putative share of Travels (a) the total number of rhymes, (b) the number of rhyme links with The Miseries of Enforced Marriage , and (c) the number of rhyme links with Miseries expressed as a percentage of the total number of rhymes (that is, total-b divided by total-a and multiplied by 100). The plays are ordered according to the size of this percentage. Pericles 1-2 is treated separately from Pericles 3-5. Pericles 1-2 heads the list with a percentage of rhyme links with Miseries that is almost double that of the highest authentic work by Shakespeare. This means that Pericles 1-2 is far more "Wilkinsian" in its rhymes—when "Wilkinsian" is defined in terms of the one play of George Wilkins's undoubted sole authorship—than any of the other plays or poems. This is a remarkable result considering the rather small number of rhymes in some of the plays, which would produce considerable chance variation in the percentages: in a play without many rhymes, a few instances of Miseries favourites such as ill|will and life|wife would have given a high percentage of links. The results are very difficult to explain without resort to a theory of dual authorship. Pericles 3-5, in striking contrast to Pericles 1-2, falls about midway on the list, exhibiting roughly the same proportion of rhyme links with Wilkins's The Miseries of Enforced Marriage as is exhibited by such other late romances as The Winter's Tale and Cymbeline . The notion that acts 1 and 2 of Pericles are early Shakespearian work receives no support from Table 2. There is no tendency for Shakespeare's earliest plays to display, in their use of rhyme, the same association with Miseries that is evident in Pericles 1-2. Nor does the theory that the style of Pericles 1-2 results from Shakespeare's conscious attempts at archaism provide a satisfactory explanation of the data. If attempts at archaism were responsible for the prevalence of rhyme links with Miseries , the links should be predominantly with the Gower choruses, which deliberately imitate Gower's medieval rhymes. But of the 58 rhyme links with Miseries in Pericles 1-2, 46 occur within the dialogue of Pericles 1-2 with its 100 rhymes, and only 12 within the Gower choruses to Pericles 1-2 with their 45 rhymes: the percentage of Miseries links with Gower choruses 1 and 2, namely 26.7, is higher than for any of the Shakespearian works, but the percentage of Miseries links with the dialogue of Pericles 1-2 rises as high as 46. In Pericles 3-5, in contrast, neither the Gower choruses nor the dialogue are significantly linked with Miseries in their use of rhyme. And of course the author of The Miseries of Enforced Marriage had no reason for aiming at archaism within that particular play, whose very success was due to its topical subject matter, the abuse of the powers of a guardian over his ward in the making of a marriage settlement. An indication that the rhyme links between Pericles 1-2 and Miseries are due to common authorship is afforded by the results for Wilkins's share of Travels , for which the percentage of links with Miseries is higher than for any of the Shakespeare works. It can hardly be coincidental that those sections of Pericles and Travels which have often been attributed to Wilkins are both more "Wilkinsian" in their rhymes than the sections of Pericles generally accepted as Shakespearian or than any other of Shakespeare's works. In themselves the results are perhaps less decisive for Wilkins's authorship of Pericles 1-2 than for the dual authorship theory generally. Dramatists other than Wilkins may have had an unShakespearian liking for Wilkinsian rhymes. Shakespeare appears to have favoured variety in his rhymes, and the high proportion of links between Pericles 1-2 and Miseries may have arisen because the rhyming in both these pieces of dramatic writing tends towards the commonplace. There are, however, less predictable links, such as consist|resist, him|sin , and impudence|offence , and this new evidence has to be considered in connection with all the other internal evidence that has been offered in support of the case for Wilkins's authorship of Pericles 1-2. David J. Lake showed that in its rates of use of certain categories of rhyme and of rhyming "rifts" and "rafts" Pericles 1-2 was more like Wilkins's verse than the undisputed verse of Shakespeare or the verse of Day, Heywood, or Rowley. M.W.A. Smith, using a computer programme to compare different plays in terms of rates of occurrence of the most common words, and strictly adhering to preset rules, has demonstrated that Pericles 1-2 is more like the acknowledged work of George Wilkins than that of George Chapman, Thomas Middleton, Ben Jonson, John Webster, Cyril Tourneur, or William Shakespeare. Smith validates his methods by showing that they can pick the correct authors of plays by Webster and Jonson, for example, when these are treated as anonymous. For the purposes of his tests, "Shakespeare" is defined as the author of Cymbeline and The Winter's Tale . Smith has not yet compared Pericles 1-2 with early Shakespeare plays. But my own statistical analysis of selected function words, which compares Pericles 1-2 and Pericles 3-5 with samples from 112 plays by twenty playwrights and represents early, middle, and late Shakespeare, shows that whereas samples by Shakespeare most closely match Pericles 3-5, samples by Wilkins most closely match Pericles 1-2. In another article I have shown that certain uses of the word "which" occur in Pericles 1-2 at rates more closely paralleled in Wilkins's work than in any play by Shakespeare or in thirty plays by nineteen other dramatists of the period. And as early as 1919 H. Dugdale Sykes had made out a case for Wilkins's responsibility for Pericles 1-2 which, though methodologically defective, was suggestive enough to persuade the Arden editor, F. D. Hoeniger, in 1963 that Wilkins probably contributed to the play. Sykes pointed especially to conspicuous elision of the relative pronoun as a feature of Wilkins's style, and it is notable that all sixteen examples in The Travels of the Three English Brothers fall within the three-fifths of the play assigned to Wilkins, as do nine of the ten examples of unusual "which". 13 Eric Sams has argued that Wilkins, an inveterate plagiarist, must have imitated Shakespeare, 14 and certainly Wilkins's prose narrative The Painful Adventures of Pericles Prince of Tyre (1608) follows the plot of the extant Pericles play and often echoes its wording. But a theory that Wilkins in Miseries and Travels imitated the style of Pericles 1-2 does not even begin to explain why Wilkins should have modelled his verse on those particular acts of the play or why they should be so notably unlike any other section of the Shakespeare canon. In Pericles we have a play whose omission from the First Folio encourages the suspicion that it is not wholly Shakespearian, and a play, moreover, which divides stylistically into two parts. The natural conclusion is that the part which sounds like Shakespeare's is his, and that somebody else wrote the rest. At present the evidence favours the identification of that second "somebody" as George Wilkins. 15 Table 1 Rhymes shared by Pericles and The Miseries of Enforced Marriage .

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 This paper was presented at a seminar, chaired by me, on "Defining Shakespeare: Works of Disputed Authorship", at the World Shakespeare Congress, Tokyo, August 1991. A useful guide to scholarship on Pericles is provided by Nancy C. Michael, Pericles: An Annotated Bibliography (1987). There is a concise evaluation of the evidence relating to the 1609 quarto in Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor with John Jowett and William Montgomery, William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion (1987), pp. 130-131 and 556-560. 2 Philip Edwards, "An Approach to the Problem of Pericles," Shakespeare Survey , 5 (1952), 25-49. Edwards reargued the case, in modified form, in his Penguin edition of Pericles (1976), 7-8, 31-41, 193-199. Gary Taylor offers a rebuttal in "The Transmission of Pericles ," PBSA , 80 (1986), 193-217. 3 This has been the view upheld by James O. Wood in a series of articles, notably "The Running Image in Pericles ," Shakespeare Studies , 5 (1969), 240-252. He has been joined by an impassioned advocate in Eric Sams, "The Painful Misadventures of Pericles Acts I and II," Notes and Queries , 236 (1991), 67-70. 4 F. David Hoeniger expounds this idea in "Gower and Shakespeare," Shakespeare Quarterly , 33 (1982), 461-479. Karen Csengeri supports single authorship in "William Shakespeare, Sole Author of Pericles ," English Studies , 71 (1990), 230-243. 5 This was Hoeniger's position when editing the Arden Pericles (1963), and it has been taken by almost all editors of the play. 6 The quarto's attribution of Pericles to Shakespeare alone is less significant. Both A Yorkshire Tragedy (1608) and The London Prodigal (1605) were first published in quartos assigning them to Shakespeare and the King's Men. Yet even scholars who suspect that Shakespeare may have had "something to do" with one or both these plays are unwilling to suppose that he was the sole author of them both. 7 The case for Wilkins is summarized in Hoeniger's Arden edition, pp. lix-lxii, and in the Oxford Textual Companion , as in note 1 above.

Lake, "Rhymes in Pericles," Notes and Queries , 214 (1969), 139-143; "Wilkins and Pericles — Vocabulary", Notes and Queries , 214 (1969), 288-291; "The Pericles Candidates—Heywood, Rowley, Wilkins," Notes and Queries , 215 (1970), 135-141; M.

Dugdale Sykes, Sidelights on Shakespeare (Stratford on Avon, 1919), pp. 143-204. 10 John Jowett makes good use of the evidence of rhymes to distinguish between Chettle and Munday in "Henry Chettle and the Original Text of Sir Thomas More," Shakespeare and "Sir Thomas More": Essays on the Play and its Shakespearian Interest , ed. T. H. Howard-Hill (1989), 131-149. 11 The source text for Pericles was the Arden edition, for Miseries the Malone Society Reprint, ed. Glenn H. Blayney (1964 for 1963). But my line references for Shakespeare's rhymes are taken from Helge Kökeritz, Shakespeare's Pronunciation (1953). 12 The text used was that in The Works of John Day , ed. A. H. Bullen (1881; reprinted London: Holland Press, 1963). The table on p. xix of Robin Jeffs's introduction to the reprint shows considerable agreement among scholars over which portions of the play were written by Wilkins. Like Lake, I accept the following sections as his: pp. 319-320, 328-341 ("Enter the great Turke . . ." to "Exeunt"), 348-360 ("Enter Chorus" to "Exit"), 378-389 (to "Exit"), 391-405 (from "Exit Iaylor . . ."); the lack of scene divisions in Bullen's edition and the different pagination of the reprint cause some confusion over allocations; the passage from "Enter Messenger" to "Exeunt" on p. 328 may be by Wilkins. 13 This last statement is substantiated in my " Pericles , Acts I and II: New Evidence for George Wilkins," Notes and Queries , 235 (1990), 196, notes 12-14. References for all the articles described in this paragraph are given in note 7 of the present article; see note 9 for Sykes. 14 As in note 3 above. 15 To attribute Pericles 1-2 to Wilkins is not necessarily to claim that he wrote everything in this portion of the play. There are passages for which Shakespeare may well have been responsible. The first sixteen lines of the first Gower chorus are a fine introduction to the play's essential concerns, as Howard Felperin stressed in "Shakespeare's Miracle Play," Shakespeare Quarterly , 18 (1967), 363-374. And yet Gower's initial couplet contains a nasal rhyme ( sung|come ) typical of Wilkins. The speech with which Pericles opens 2.1 begins with four strong blank verse lines not unworthy of Shakespeare, collapses into bathos with the next three lines, which include a rhymed couplet, picks up with two good blank verse lines that might have followed on directly from the first four, and ends with an undistinguished but unobjectionable couplet. However, Wilkins's Miseries and share in Travels show that he was quite capable of producing effective verse, though intermittently. Whatever the extent and nature of Wilkins's participation in the play, its overall design, though unusual, seems Shakespearian.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A Restoration Lampoon in Transmission and Revision: Rochester's(?) "Signior Dildo" by Harold Love</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The texts of 'Signior Dildo'," writes Keith Walker, "differ widely, not to say wildly. There is general agreement on the title, but upon little else." 1 This challenge has been impossible to pass up. What follows is a report on an attempt to establish the relationship of the texts, together with a reconsideration of the question of authorship. A full collation of the known early texts is included as none has so far been published. 2 "Signior Dildo" is a lampoon directed at ladies of the court of Charles II on the excuse of their supposed passion for the "Italian" device: as far as is known it is the only poem in the English language wholly devoted to the advocacy of masturbation. It belongs to a tradition of mysogynistic dildo satires which reaches back as far as the sixth mimiamb of Herondas (first or second century A.D.), and was represented in English as early as Nashe's "A Choice of Valentines" (1592). In 1671 a consignment of dildos, in this case French, had been seized on arrival in England and burned, inspiring the widely copied burlesque "Dildoides," which accompanies "Signior Dildoe" in the anthologies of the well-known "Cameron" scriptorium. 3 The occasion of the poem was the arrival in London of Mary of Modena on 26 November 1673 as the bride-to-be of James, Duke of York—indeed it may even have been written as a set of fescennine verses for some celebration connected with the royal wedding. On 26 January following, a letter from Walter Overbury to Sir Joseph Williamson mentions the sending of "a song of a certain senior that came in with the Dutchesse of Modena," adding that "it reaches and touches most of the ladys from Westminster to Wapping." 4 Its first appearance in print was not to be until 1703, transmission up to that time being exclusively in sung or manuscript form. The currently accepted attribution to Rochester, while not intrinsically improbable, rests, as we shall see later, on rather thin evidence. Crudely written to the ballad tune "Peg's gone to sea with a soldier," the lampoon gives every sign of hurried composition. Its jaunty tune can be found in Claude M. Simpson, The British Broadside Ballad and its music (New Brunswick, 1966), p. 572.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sources The early texts currently known are as follows: British Library MS Harley 7317, ff. 65 v -67 r ( BLh17 ) British Library MS Harley 7319, ff. 4 r -6 v ( BLh19 ) Nottingham University Library MS Portland Pw V 42, pp. 13-20 ( Np42 ) Bodleian MS Don b 8, pp. 477-478, 480-482 ( Od8 ) Bodleian MS Firth c 15, pp. 10-14 ( Of15 ) Ohio State University Library MS Eng. 15, pp. 10-14 ( OSe15 ) Princeton University Library MS Taylor 2, pp. 9-13 ( Pt2 ) Österreichische Nationalbibliothek MS 14090, ff. 66 v -68 v ( V90 ) Victoria and Albert Museum MS Dyce 43, pp. 119-124 ( VAd43 ) Poems on Affairs of State (London, 1703), pp. 188-191 ( 03 ) Between them these represent two distinct recensions, the first of which itself exists in two highly variant forms. Once this fact is realised, the disparities begin to look less alarming.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The versions Version A is represented by the earliest datable text, Od8 , a much later one, BLh17 , and a single stanza entered by a reader of OSe15 . The first of these is part of the personal miscellany of the courtier Sir William Haward, an assiduous collector of topical satire. While it cannot be assumed that Sir William entered material in strict order of acquisition, in this case "Signior Dildo" follows an item which is specifically marked as having been transcribed on 23 November 1673. The poem is in two sections, incongruously separated by "On the bible A Pindarique Ode." Significantly, the second is headed "Additions to Seigneur Dildoe." Taken together with the "Additions," which include some stanzas found in other integral texts, this is by far the longest version of the poem, and indicates that, once in circulation, it had continued to grow. The second source, BLh17 , gives a shorter, differently ordered text of the same version without the division into two sections. This occurs in a manuscript anthology with a strong Jacobite tendency, copied no earlier than 1695. 5 Although neatly written, this collection is error-prone. Its marginalia, found throughout the volume, are mostly the creation of the scribe or compiler, who was not very well informed. Despite the many variants between BLh17 and Od8 , they agree consistently against the B version both at the verbal level and in some aspects of stanza sequence; however, all but four of the actual lines of the B version are to be found in one or the other text of the A version. BLh17 lacks only B version lines 37-40 and 77-92, while the two sections of Od8 contain all the B-version lines except for 45-48 and 77-80. Both A-version texts contain a group of eight lines (ll. 24.1-24.8) which are not found in the B version, while a further forty lines (ll. 28.1-28.12, 28.17-28.32, 36.1-36.4, 40.1-40.4, 92.1-92.4) are unique to Od8 . Lines 28.13-28.16, found in Od8 but not BLh17 , reappear as a reader's scribble in the margin of the B-version text, OSe15 . Of the B-version texts, all but BLh19 and 03 are found in anthologies of satires issued by the Cameron scriptorium and can be assumed to descend from the archive copy of that scriptorium. V90 and VAd43 belong to Cameron's "Restoration" group and Np42 , Of15 , OSe15 and Pt2 to his "Venus" group. The handful of anomalous agreements almost certainly arise from chance concurrence in change and the minor memorial contamination to be expected within a busy scribal organisation. 6 The printed text 03 may also derive from a scriptorium original—a matter considered below. The other B-version scribal text, BLh19 , is found in a large anthology of satires written circa 1695 which displays a special hostility towards Mary of Modena. 7 Although similar in its layout and scope to the scriptorium anthologies, it is actually the product of another agency.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Order of stanzas The transmission of the poem is characterised by a remarkable, and at first sight chaotic, degree of variation in the sequence of stanzas. Taking as our point of reference the line-order of BLh19 and VAd43 , which is probably that of the lost B-version ancestor, we find the following variants. A version: BLh17 : 1-24, 24.1-24.8, 29-32, 25-28, 57-60, 33-36, 45-48, 41-44, 49-56, 65-72, 61-64, 73-76 Od8/I : 1-16, 29-32, 17-24, 24.1-24.8 [ marg. ], 57-60, 49-56, 73-76, 61-64 Od8/2 (the "Additions"): 33-36, 36.1-36.4, 25-28, 28.1-28.32, 81-92, 92.1-92.4, 65-72, 41-44, 37-40, 40.1-40.4 OSe15-marg : 28.13-28.16. B version: BLh19 : 1-92 Np42 : 1-7, 12, 9-20, 25-28, 21-24, 29-92 [ line 12 appears twice ] Of15 : 1-56, 61-92 OSe15 : 1-36, 41-72, 28.13-28.16 [ marginal in second hand ], 73-92 8 Pt2 : 1-32, 37-92 V90 : 1-32, 37-40, 33-36, 41-48, 53-56, 49-52, 57-92 [ both pairs of inverted stanzas reordered by marginal numbers ] VAd43 : 1-92 03 : 1-32, 37-40, 33-36, 41-92 Apart from the striking variations between versions A and B and the two texts of A, most of these differences arise from nothing more than the scribe skipping over a stanza, and either omitting it entirely or repairing the damage by incorporating it after its incorrectly entered successor. The whole-stanza eyeskip was an easy enough error in a poem composed of four-line stanzas with a refrain, especially as it is only in the conclusion that we encounter anything resembling a developing narrative. The lineation variants suggest that some aspect of the scriptorium master copy led to confusion over the correct position of the stanzas ll. 33-36 and ll. 37-40. It should be remembered that the sources listed are the survivors of many times that number. The fact that the term "signior" became accepted as a euphemism for dildo indicates that knowledge of the 1673 version was much more widespread than the one remaining pre-1690 transcript would suggest. 9 Of course, this may have happened through hearing the piece sung rather than reading it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The growth of the text There are three possible models for the development of the two versions. The first, which I prefer, is that the A version preserves the original form of the poem and the B version is a later (perhaps much later) revision. The second, which has been assumed by all editors of Rochester, is that the B version preserves the original form and the A version is a revision, though in this case one that was already present at the earliest stage of circulation. The third is that the A and the B versions derived independently from a lost version that was either radically different from either of them, or so equally balanced between them as to be assignable to neither group. While such a derivation is textually possible, the historical evidence mitigates against it and it will not be considered further. The case for the primacy of the A version rests on the form in which the poem was recorded by Haward and the fact that his version is the earliest by at least seventeen years of those that survive. Od8 carefully divides the poem into two sections with the second classified as "Additions." The simple sense of this would seem to be that the fourteen-stanza version preserves something close to the original form in which the poem was circulated at court in 1673, and that the additions represent a subsequent initiative, material from which in some cases found its way into an enlarged integral text. Under this assumption BLh17 would represent a version revised to the extent of incorporating lines 25-28, 33-36, 41-44 and 65-72, found in the Od8 additions, into the main text and rationalizing the order of stanzas, but not so far as adding the "pursuit" stanzas (ll. 81-92), which are present in Od8/2 , though not in the concluding position they occupy in the B version. In fact, both Od8/1 and BLh17 conclude with lines 61-64, 73-76, though with the two stanzas in the reverse of this order in Od8/1 . As mentioned earlier, all the B-version lines are to be found in one or other of the A-version sources. Under this hypothesis, the B version would represent a second level of revision, based on an A-version text different from either of those we possess. An opposed view, tacitly accepted by Vieth, Wilson and Walker, is that it is the B version, not Od8/1 , that represents the original form of the poem; that Od8/1 , by implication, should be regarded as a cut-down version of this; and that Od8/2 is an assemblage of "lost" as well as added stanzas. (In fact none of the editors mentioned even discusses the problem of the versions, only Walker warning his readers that there are problems with the text of this poem.) This order of development is not impossible but requires us to assume a self-consciously literary origin for the poem, which seems at odds with its improvisatory, occasional air and the likelihood that its early transmission would have been as much in sung as in written form. (The B version is certainly the more polished.) It also seems to proceed from the assumption that the poem is the work of Rochester rather than, say, of some court singer, an assumption that is far less secure than editors have suggested. A further objection, already raised, is that, while we know from BLh17 and the marginal addition to OSe15 that the A version was known in the 1690s, there is no evidence prior to this date for the existence of the B version. To gain further purchase on the dating problem it will be necessary to consider the political meaning of the satire both at the time of composition and at that of its renewed circulation in the mid-1690s. In its original conception it was an attack on the Yorkist party at court, whose position had been strengthened by the marriage of the Catholic heir to the throne to a Catholic princess. (This theme is particularly apparent in Od8/2 , but the majority of the victims throughout were either Catholics or sympathisers.) Its circulation at this period was clearly anonymous and its substance elastic: Haward went as far as to leave a blank space for any future additions he might acquire or invent. Intended for singing, it was to be regarded as a performance piece rather than a work for the eye. Once its topicality departed, it ceased to be transcribed and is found in none of the many scribal anthologies of the later 1670s and the 1680s. The reappearance of the poem in anthologies of the 1690s must have resulted from more than the chance survival of a copy. There could hardly have been much interest in the sexual taunts of twenty years earlier, but there would certainly have been in the connection with Mary of Modena, who had gone into exile in December 1688 and was now living near Paris with her husband, James II. The revival of a poem poking fun at the events of her marriage and at the morals of the Catholic nobility of that epoch would have an obvious polemic value to supporters of the Protestant succession. Moreover, if the renewed circulation of the satire at this stage, in anthologies written by professional scribes, was a deliberate anti-Jacobite initiative, it is also possible that the rewriting that produced the B version was done at that time. The compiler of BLh17 and the annotator of OSe15 were presumably interested in the poem for the same reason but had encountered it in the A version. By accepting the hypothesis that Od8/1 preserves the earliest form of the poem and that all other surviving texts are derived from this version (or something like it), we are able to establish the place of BLh19 in the tradition. Its agreement in A-version readings against the scriptorium texts at 12 "chance get," 17 "The," 21 "My good," 30 "Harrys," 56 "fittest," 59 "With" and 84 "upon" (see list of variants) indicates that it cannot itself be descended from the Cameron scriptorium master copy, but is a collateral descendent from a higher-level ancestor. Reconstruction of the readings of this ancestor would require adjudication between those of BLh19 and those of the scriptorium master copy which can itself be reconstructed from its descendants. The printed text of 1703 may also be independently derived from the common ancestor of BLh19 and the scriptorium master copy, though the evidence for this is less marked, and I would place greater weight on its agreements with V90 which include the displacement of lines 33-36. 10</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Authorship "Signior Dildo" has been accepted by all editors of Rochester without demur, but the evidence for his authorship is not particularly strong. The major considerations against it are as follows: (1) A vast mass of satirical verse not by Rochester was attributed to him by scribes and printers. (This problem has been exhaustively treated by Vieth in his Attribution in Restoration poetry [New Haven, 1963].) (2) Neither of our witnesses from 1673-74, Walter Overbury and Sir William Haward, appear to have thought the poem was his work. Verse by Rochester was eagerly sought at this period and there can be no doubt that the possibility of his authorship would have been mentioned if it had been suspected. (3) The poem does not appear in any of the manuscript and printed collections of Rochester's verse and Rochesteriana that appeared in 1680, the year of his death, and for some time following. The manuscripts containing the attribution were all written at least a decade after that date. (4) BLh19 attributes it to him in the "Catalogue" at the end of the volume (p. 762) but not in the text proper, suggesting a degree of uncertainty about the matter. The scribe of BLh17 copying circa 1695 was not aware of the attribution. (5) The fact that the Cameron scriptorium archive copy's attribution is repeated in its descendants Of15, OSe15, Pt2, V90 , and VAd43 does nothing to strengthen that attribution. Vieth's argument that the numerical weight of the attributions to Rochester "outweighs the single ascription" to Charles Sackville, Earl of Dorset and Fleetwood Sheppard only betrays his imperfect understanding of the textual relationships involved, despite their being made clear by Cameron's article ( Complete Poems , p. 192). (6) The attribution to Dorset and Sheppard, found in Np42 , a fairly late production from the scriptorium, presumably reflects an emendation made to the archive copy subsequent to the writing of the texts with the Rochester attribution. There would seem to be no reason for doing this apart from the controller of the archive having become persuaded that the poem was not by Rochester. (7) The victims of the poem include the Countess of Shrewsbury (ll. 45-48), who was the mistress of Rochester's patron and close friend, George Villiers, second Duke of Buckingham, and the Countess of Falmouth (ll. 25-28), who was on the point of marriage with another close friend, Dorset (who must himself, for this reason, be regarded as unlikely to have written it). There can be no doubt that the relationship between these three peers was a very close one during the mid-1680s. 11 (However, this objection would not apply to Od8/1 , which contains neither of the stanzas.) Against this, the only piece of external evidence that might link Rochester with the poem is two lines from a satire of 1680, "The visitt": "There was obscene Rotchesters Choise storys | Of matrix Glances Dildo and Clittoris." 12 But a reference to dildos does not mean a reference to "Signior Dildoe": it could easily have been inspired by "Tunbridge Wells," ll. 29-34, The Destruction of Sodom , one of whose characters is a dildo-maker, "Upon Cary Frazer," or whatever lost work was the source of the puzzling "matrix glances." The story of the Countess of Northumberland hiding her dildo under the pillow (l. 31) seems to be alluded to in "Timon," ll. 80-82; but this information would also have been available to Rochester's companions in riot, who included Dorset and Sheppard. If, indeed, the attribution to Rochester depends on no more than an annotation made to a single manuscript possibly as much as ten years after his death, and subsequently deleted in one of the descendants of that text in favor of another attribution, it cannot be regarded very seriously. This is not to say that Rochester was not capable of writing the poem, or would not have enjoyed reading it, simply that the existing attributions cannot in any way be regarded as conclusive.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Conclusion The main point of interest to emerge from the collation is that, as already demonstrated, BLh19 is not a Cameron scriptorium text but independently derived from the B-version ancestor. Among the scriptorium texts, the Restoration pair ( V90, VAd43 ) form a sub-group in which VAd43 by virtue of having no unique variants must be declared the ancestor and V90 the copy; however, it would be rash to assume that this relationship was consistent throughout the entire length of these bulky anthologies. There is no firm evidence among the variants for the existence of an exclusive common ancestor for the "Venus" group ( Np42, Of15, OSe15, Pt2 ), distinct from the scriptorium master copy; but a wider analysis of the collections could well reveal one. In this connection, attention should be paid to the close similarity of the hands of Of15, OSe15 and Pt2 , which to me suggests conscious mimicry of that of a common exemplar.</field>

See also pp. 537-538. 8 Following l. 80, the OSe15 scribe got as far as writing l. 85, the first of the following stanza, and then had to scrape it out before inscribing the correct line. 9 Wilson, p. 14, cites the epilogue to The Mistaken Husband (1675): "What will not poor forsaken women try? | When man's not near, the Signior must supply." 10 For variants of both tendencies see Title (assuming 1678 is a mistake for 1673), and ll. 17, 26, 27, 30 ("Harris"), 43, 44, 51, 53, 62 and 67. Few of these are of the kind to carry much textual weight; however, 43 "least" and 53 "Moll" certainly suggest at least a memorial influence from an extra-scriptorial source. 11 Note in this respect the affectionate letters from Dorset and Buckingham reprinted in The Letters of John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester , ed. Jeremy Treglown (Oxford, 1980), pp. 51-52, 60-62, 145-149 and 151-155, and their inclusion among the list of close friends in the concluding lines of "An Allusion to Horace" ( circa 1675). 12 Lincolnshire Archives Office MS Anc 15/B/4, p. 20. 13 I wish to thank Joan McKeown, Dianne Heriot and Meredith Sherlock for their assistance in preparing and checking this list. 14 The references are to Np42 and BLh19 respectively. 15 This note seems to have been intended for 1.6, where "Her" is underlined. 16 The speaker is the Duchess of Portsmouth whose apartments were at the end of the Long Gallery at the Palace of Whitehall. The fumbler is the king—this being the only reference to him in any version of the poem. 17 This stanza has the same victim as ll. 69-72. The OSe15 annotator has positioned it to follow that stanza. 18 The "Harrys" variant shared by BLh19 and Od8/1 is likely to be the original reading, the reference apparently being to an occasion on which Rochester's friend, Henry Savile, had attempted to rape the countess ( Letters , pp. 68-69). "Harris" is found only in texts descended from the scriptorium master copy. 19 Actually her mother. 20 The sex confusion is repeated in V90 . 21 There was no military or naval officer named "Bartrow," which should be given consideration as the lectio difficilior . If it is not simply a mistake for "cazzo" (Italian for penis), the context would suggest an allusion to Charles II under his Civil-war pseudonym "Barlow".</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Bibliographical Significance of the Turned Letter by Robin Dix and Trudi Laura Darby *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carelessness at one or more of the various stages of book production has caused bibliographers and editors many headaches over the years. And yet it is generally accepted that certain forms of carelessness can be very revealing—a leaf slit for cancellation but not actually removed, for example, is a valuable find. The humble turned letter can also be used for a wide variety of bibliographical purposes by those who are alive to its potential. In normal circumstances, the production of an accurate text in the handpress period was the result of a team effort by author, scribe if there was one, compositor, in-house proof-corrector and, possibly, author as proofreader; and unless manuscripts and proofs have survived, it is not easy to distinguish their individual contributions to the accuracy of the finished product. In the absence of such documents, a turned letter can provide useful evidence about the compositor's working habits and the degree of care he used. It should after all have been more or less impossible to allow an inverted letter to stand: the nick in the front of each sort meant that by running his thumb along a line of type after he had set it, a compositor could check that each letter was the right way up. The existence of a turned letter in print thus implies that the compositor either did not check the nicks, or, having checked them and found an error, did not rectify it. In fact, inversions of the grossest kind—that is, where the resulting symbol does not form a letter at all—are comparatively rare. Doubtless the nicks enabled compositors to find the vast majority of such errors themselves, and to correct them while the type was still in the stick; those that were missed at this stage would have been picked up easily enough in proof (assuming that the page in question was proofread). But there was one letter where the attitude of all concerned was likely to be very different: rounded 's'. Here, inversion did not result either in nonsense or in a different letter: the mark would be read correctly, even when inverted, by all who saw it; and while the upper and lower loops of the letter differed in virtually all old typefaces, 1 the number of readers who noticed such minutiae would have been tiny. For these reasons, those in the printing-house who found an inverted 's' were unlikely to devote time and resources to correcting it. Perhaps the most obvious use of the turned letter is in the identification of different states within a book. A glance at the bibliography of Locke's An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding (1690) provides a good example. The first edition of this seminal philosophical text exists in two issues. In what is now generally accepted as the later of the two, the title-page is a cancel, presumably introduced because considerable changes had to be made to the imprint; but the most immediately noticeable difference is that both 'S's of 'ESSAY' are inverted. 2 The case is unusual only because of the prominence of the error: most editors of works from the hand-press period will find instances of turned 's' if the texts they are dealing with are substantial. In the works of Mark Akenside (1721-1770), for example, there are some twenty cases of inverted 's' 3 —and Akenside's printers were conscientious professionals such as Hughs and Bowyer. It has to be recognized that uneven inking or damaged type can mask the serifs and distort the proportions of the letter, and that in a small number of cases the inversion may thus be more apparent than real. Nevertheless, the evidence is normally unequivocal, and there are occasions when it can provide bibliographical information of significance beyond the existence of variant states. Thus, in 'Hymn to the Naiads', one of Akenside's contributions to Dodsley's A Collection of Poems by Several Hands (vol. vi, 1st edn., 1758), an inverted 's' not only led to the discovery of a previously unidentified variant state within the first gathering but also strongly suggested that a very late, major authorial change, hitherto unsuspected, had been made to the text. There are two typographical differences between the variant states: the final 's' of 'steams' (A3 r , 15th line of text) is the right way up in the newly discovered state, and a hyphen which usually appears between 'ill' and 'repaid' (A3 v , 23rd line) is omitted. Tests using a straight edge show that the type on both pages was largely reset between printings. This fact was in turn explained by Michael Suarez, S.J., of Campion Hall Oxford: in the newly discovered state without the hyphen or the turned letter, A3, which is usually a cancel, forms an integral part of gathering A. 4 The reason for cancelling the original leaf remains obscure: these two tiny adjustments comprise the only textual differences. As such changes are clearly insufficient to warrant cancellation, the most likely explanation is that a late authorial change necessitated some resetting and the insertion of a cancel, and that at a suitable opportunity A3 was reset to incorporate the revision into the formes for A. 5 No manuscripts of the poem survive, and no copies of gathering A in any other state are known, however, so the theory cannot be proved. These examples from Locke and Akenside show how the introduction or correction of a turned letter such as rounded 's' suggests resetting. Similarly, the recurrence of an inverted sort in supposedly different editions implies that not all the type was distributed. Take for instance The World Tost at Tennis , a masque written by Middleton and Rowley, and printed by George Purslowe. The British Library catalogue states that the book exists in two editions; but both contain two examples of turned 's': in 'names' on B3 v and 'wrongs' on E4 v . This strongly suggests that the type, in these areas at least, was not distributed between the printings. Further analysis shows that the different 'editions' are in fact merely different states: the title-page is a variant leaf, and the type is otherwise undisturbed. A second example of recurring inversion, from Akenside's Odes on Several Subjects (1745; quarto edition), shows how a turned letter can provide important clues in bibliographical puzzles. Gathering B exists in three states: in one, it is printed normally; in another, B1 v contains the text of p. 52 rather than p. 10; while in the third, B1 is a cancel, and the pagination runs correctly. It is possible to demonstrate that in the two variant states containing p. 10, the type is of the same setting; and a very useful piece of evidence contributing to that demonstration is the fact that in the penultimate line the 's' of 'is' is inverted. This in turn permits a credible explanation of the error. The book was printed normally, but it became necessary to print extra copies of B; the formes for B were reassembled while G was also being assembled at the imposing-stone; G2 v was accidentally placed in the wrong chase; and when the error was discovered, it was rectified by cancellation. 6 A third example of recurring inversion gives an interesting insight into compositors' sharp practice in eighteenth-century print shops. Akenside's best-known poem, The Pleasures of Imagination , was brought out by Robert Dodsley in January 1744, and went through three further editions that year. The first two editions were quartos, the third and fourth octavos. A few of the later formes in the quartos are of the same setting of type; but the octavos have always been considered as quite distinct from each other. The third edition appeared in May, the fourth in November 1744. In fact the octavos are not entirely distinct. The poem contains a number of long footnotes in the first half of Book III, and parts of these, along with some of the prelims, are of the same setting of type in both. The clearest signal to the editor is that at several points an inverted 's' appears in the same place in the same word in the two editions. A comparison of damaged sorts in the two editions, and tests using a straight edge, confirm that a considerable part of the long notes in gatherings G and H are indeed of the same setting of type. 7 The same tests, however, show that the poetry on these pages was reset. The implication seems to be that the compositors did not relish the prospect of resetting the long notes, which were in small type and which required justification, so they transferred type from the previous edition wherever possible for these; but they reset the verse, thus making the page look different, and so ensuring that they were paid in full. W. B. Todd identified and described a similar practice (which he called 'featherbedding') in his bibliography of Burke, and we venture to suggest that it is more frequent in the hand-press period than has been recognized. 8 It is obviously a habit that editors need to be aware of, and the recurrence of an inverted 's' at the same point in supposedly different editions is precisely the kind of feature which can serve to alert them to it. It is possible that with rounded 's' a compositor might have made a conscious decision not to emend: he may have identified the turned letter, seen that it was an 's', and ignored it on the basis that the inversion was unimportant. But even if some of the instances can be explained in this way, the implication is still that the compositor was prepared to make judgments about the weight to be attached to a mistake. From an editor's point of view, such an attitude must affect any assessment of the reliability of the text, and may justify a less conservative approach to troublesome readings than would normally be permissible. The Akenside texts examined so far represent an extreme case, in that they were carefully set, and received attention from an author who was more than usually interested in typographical minutiae. 9 But the significance of the turned letter remains—and indeed in some respects increases—when texts at the other end of the spectrum are involved. Seventeenth-century drama provides good material to illustrate the point. Received wisdom has it that each newly-imposed forme was proofed; 10 but it is very common to find that, in quartos at least, printers' errors occur in groups, interspersed with relatively 'clean' formes. The obvious inference is that often only sample formes of the less prestigious books received proof correction. If the formes which were accorded this attention can be identified, the modern editor is able to assess the accuracy of each compositor involved in the production of a given text—and indeed the accuracy of the proof corrector. And a further conclusion is possible: when formes which did not receive the corrector's attention contain a significant number of turned letters, it is necessary to bear in mind the possibility of emendation wherever symmetrical letters can make a viable alternative reading by being rotated. Every 'jape' may in fact be a 'jade'. The importance of turned letters—both those which were spotted by the corrector, and those which were not—is well illustrated by the surviving copies of A New Wonder, A Woman Never Vext , a play by William Rowley which Purslowe printed for Francis Constable in 1632. Eleven copies survive in the United Kingdom, one in Stockholm, and another twelve in the United States. 11 The press variants in sheets A-D are due mainly to loose or pulled type, or poor inking; but in the outer forme of E the nature of the changes alters, and there are more corrections of obvious compositorial errors. For instance, 'solyd' is corrected to 'soyld' (E1 r ), 'handfell' to 'handsell' and a turned 'a' put right (E2 v ), 'some' altered to 'sum' (E3 r ), and an erroneous signature ('E5') corrected to 'E3'. The inner forme of F shows some thirteen press variants of a similar kind. Those on F4 r are particularly interesting, as they imply a preferred spelling for certain words: these were amended, apparently to conform to house style. 12 The outer forme of G shows an added 'Sir' on G1 r , and speech prefixes which were incorrectly assigned are changed on G2 v . 13 Equally important are the corrections which should have been made but were not—most obviously, in the inner forme of E, the signature 'E2' on E3 was not put right. The easiest inference is that E outer, F inner and possibly G inner were proof-read, but that the other formes were not. The alternative explanation—that a second, more conscientious compositor was involved with these formes—is unlikely: an analysis of running titles, italicised type, punctuation and spacing suggests that A-H were set by a single compositor. It was not until sheet I that an apparently more experienced workman was brought in, whose italic usage differed from house style. The text of A New Wonder, A Woman Never Vext shows a relatively high incidence of turned letters. Moxon asserts in Mechanick Exercises that if a letter is turned, the corrector marks it and the compositor picks it out and puts it back correctly (p. 249). This seems to have happened on the corrected pages of E and F that we have noted; and on K2 r an inverted 'm' in the running title was emended. On K4 r , 'H' was set sideways below the line; this again was corrected in press. But other examples of inversion escaped correction: on F2 v 'shade' is printed instead of 'shape'; on H2 v we have 'barkiug' for 'barking'; on K3 v 'disiuheritance' for 'disinheritance', and on K4 v 'onght' for 'ought'. Of these, the n/u confusion may well be attributable to foul case, and is unlikely to cause serious problems for either editor or reader, however important it may be to a bibliographer concerned with the conscientiousness of the compositor. The story is rather different with the inverted 'p' on F2 v , which produced 'shade': in context, the reading makes sense of a sort, and only the vigilant reader or editor will realize that the wrong word has been created. Close examination of the serifs shows that the 'd' is in fact a turned 'p'. But that in itself is insufficient to prove that 'shade' is wrong: foul case could explain the presence of a 'p' sort among the 'd's, and the compositor may have inverted the letter deliberately in order to obtain a 'correct' reading more quickly than he could by replacing the letter in its proper box and selecting another. Ultimately, the question of which reading to accept has to be decided by the editor, using the full range of his or her critical judgment. Purslowe's shop printed another play in 1632: Changes by James Shirley. This text shares certain distinctive characteristics with A New Wonder, A Woman Never Vext , notably the setting of prose as verse. Purslowe had printed dramatic texts before—he printed ten in his nineteen years in business—but the last had been an edition of Mucedorus in 1626, and both Changes and A New Wonder, A Woman Never Vext seem to have been set mainly by a compositor unfamiliar with dramatic works. In fact Purslowe employed two apprentices at this time, both of whom joined him in 1629. 14 Changes shows turned letters on B2 r (terminal 's' of 'spurnes'), D1 v ('s' of 'appeares'), E3 r (' Anr. ' for ' Aur. ' in the uncorrected state), and F4 r ('s' of 'vertues'). An especially noteworthy turned 's' is found in the running title which appears on B3 v , B4 v , and then on 1 v and 4 v of C-F and G1 v . The letter was corrected on G4 v and recurs, the right way up, on H1 v , H4 v , I1 v , I4 v and K1 v (K being a half-sheet). Sheets A-F are generally poorly set, with a number of obvious errors such as 'as' for 'at' (A3 v ), 'servantss' (C1 v ), 'athough' (C4 r ), 'Be' for 'By', 'ad' for 'and' (D1 v ), 'yon' for 'you' (D3 r : probably foul case). Although G-L are not flawless, there is only one obvious error of this kind ('chsue' for 'chuse', K2 r ). It should also be noted that character names are set in roman in some stage directions, instead of in italic as in the remainder of the text, on F2 v , F3 r , F4 v , G1 v , G2 r , G3 r and G3 v (there are no entrances on F3 v , F4 r or G1 r ; on G2 v a marginal stage direction is entirely in italic). No collation of this text has been attempted; 15 but the alteration to the running title could suggest that at F outer a second, more accurate, workman was assigned to the project, and that it was he who corrected the turned letter, once he noticed it while composing G outer. This would accord with the practice in setting A New Wonder, A Woman Never Vext , for which a more experienced workman was apparently brought in at I. An examination of turned letters in sample texts from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, then, suggests a number of points which are of interest to editors and bibliographers. First, inversions generally can help to prove that two supposedly different editions, or passages, are of the same setting of type; and where either the text was not proofread, or where the proofreader was unlikely to require a correction to be made (as with rounded 's'), inversions can also be useful in proving that the setting has been changed. Secondly, the frequency with which turned letters appear in uncorrected passages or texts gives an editor a quick and valuable indication of the compositor's reliability, and may also be of use in compositorial identification. Thirdly, and perhaps most radically, where inversion is frequent, editors need to beware of any characters which could form a different letter when rotated about a horizontal, vertical, or oblique axis. This remains true even where the page was proofread and rounded 's' is the only unequivocal evidence of inversion to remain: since proofing was normally done orally, it would be easy enough for sounds such as 'shape' and 'shade' to be confused if the wrong word had been created. Nasal congestion, dialectal differences, and other factors apparently extraneous to a bibliographer's concerns, may play their part in determining the accuracy of the printed text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * The authors would like to thank B. W. Ife, Cervantes Professor of Spanish at King's College London, for reading and commenting on the article in draft. 1 In England, Caslon's, Baskerville's, and Martin's designs all used an asymmetrical form of rounded 's'. The same is true of the major French, Dutch and Italian typefaces. 2 For bibliographical descriptions of the two issues, and a discussion of priority, see the catalogue for the Carl H. Pforzheimer Library: English Literature 1475-1700 (1940), 619-621. 3 Four examples—from Dodsley's Collection (1758), Odes on Several Subjects (1745), and two from The Pleasures of Imagination (3rd and 4th editions, 1744)—are discussed in this article. Others include 'A British Philippic', Gentleman's Magazine viii (1738), 428 (terminal 's' of 'sons', line 102); The Pleasures of Imagination (first edition, 1744, Foxon A139), iii. 621 (terminal 's' of 'sun's'); op. cit. (Dodsley's seventh edition, 1765), ii. 241 ('s' of 'thunders'); op. cit. (Dodsley's eighth edition, 1769), iii. 504 ('s' of 'feels'); and The Pleasures of Imagination ii. 621 ('s' of 'eyes') in the posthumous The Poems of Mark Akenside, M.D. (quarto edition, 1772). 4 R. W. Chapman, 'Dodsley's Collection of Poems by Several Hands', Oxford Bibliographical Society Proceedings &amp; Papers iii (1931-33), 272, lists A3 as a cancel, but does not mention the existence of the variant, uncancelled state. Michael Suarez and I (RD) were working on Dodsley's Collection at the British Library on the same day. I found the variant readings, and he found that the variants depended on whether or not there was a cancel. He generously told me about his discovery. The British Library has three copies of the 1758 edition of volume vi; of these, C.107.dg.28 and C117.aa.16 are in the cancelled state; 992.d.17 in the uncancelled. 5 W. B. Todd analyses the printing schedules of Dodsley's Collection in 'Concurrent Printing: An Analysis of Dodsley's Collection of Poems by Several Hands', PBSA xlvi (1952), 45-57, and it is clear that various opportunities for such adjustment would have arisen during the rather halting start to the printing of volume vi. 6 For discussion of the various possible explanations for this error, and their respective probability, see R. Dix, 'Akenside's Odes on Several Subjects', The Library VI xiv (1992) 51-59. 7 See 'things' (G4 v , 13th line of note), and 'this' (H3 r , 5th line of note). On H4 r , another page where the note is of the same setting in both the third and fourth editions, an inverted 's' in 'species' (12th line of note) in the third edition is corrected in the fourth; but a misprint only four lines further on ( accute ) was being corrected here, and the opportunity was apparently taken to correct the turned letter at the same time. 8 For Todd's discussion of 'featherbedding', see his A Bibliography of Edmund Burke (1964), pp. 146-147. Among Akenside's works, featherbedding occurred between the two folio texts of A British Philippic (1738), and the two 'editions' of An Ode to the Country Gentlemen of England (1758). There are two other possible cases. First, as D. F. Foxon noted in 'Akenside's The Pleasures of Imagination', The Book Collector v (1956), 77-78, the two 1744 quartos of The Pleasures of Imagination , O-Q, together with the prelims and some of both formes of N, are shared between the editions. Changes were introduced into the standing type between the printings, though, so this is no simple case of overprinting the final formes in preparation for the second edition. Second, in An Ode to the Right Honourable the Earl of Huntingdon (1748) the two editions share the same setting of B outer and the half-sheet D. In the case of the octavo editions of The Pleasures of Imagination , the six-month gap between them would normally ensure that the type was distributed. But this poem was so much in demand—there were four 'official' editions and several piracies in 1744 alone—that standing type may well have been stored in case it could be re-used at some stage. 9 Changes introduced into the standing type, such as those introduced into the quarto editions of The Pleasures of Imagination (1744) and mentioned in the previous note, can be ascribed to the author with reasonable confidence. The eccentric typography of Akenside's later works reflects his practice in manuscript, and must demonstrate his involvement in decisions affecting the appearance of the printed book. 10 P.

      <field name="heading_text">Young's Corrections to Dodington's Epistle to Bute : Evidence from the Yale Manuscript by James E. May</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1776, Thomas Becket published A Poetical Epistle from the Late Lord Melcombe to the Earl of Bute: With Corrections, by the Author of the Night Thoughts . 1 George Bubb Dodington, Lord Melcombe, though better known as a politician and patron, dabbled in poetry while at Oxford before entering politics and returned to it throughout his career. Although he published few poems, these have not slipped unnoticed from the press. His An Epistle to Sir Robert Walpole (1725) was reprinted in London and Dublin; his "On Sir Robert Walpole's Birth-Day" was reprinted in Dodsley's A Collection of Poems by Several Hands ; and his ode "Shorten Sail," to be discussed below, was anthologized in our own century. 2 He had been a friend, collaborator, and patron of the poet Edward Young, the author of The Complaint or Night Thoughts (1742-45), from his Oxford years into the 1720's; then they grew apart until the collaboration discussed below brought them together in 1761, forging a final reconciliation. In 1710, Dodington had written flatteringly of fellow Exeter College poet George Stubbes that his lines were "bold as nervous Y --- g. " Dodington would later help Young not only to obtain a pension for poetical accomplishments from the Walpole administration but also to revise his tragedies and his satires The Universal Passion (1725-28), largely written at Dodington's Eastbury estate. 3 Thus, it was with some justice that Dodington late in his career turned to Young for help with his Poetical Epistle to the Earl of Bute . Becket's publication consists of a brief publisher's advertisement, the Proem, the Epistle proper, and a series of footnotes to both sets of verses. In the advertisement, while insisting on his source's authenticity, Becket offered a vague description of the manuscript: "To preclude every Doubt, concerning it's Authenticity, the Original Manuscript, in Lord Melcombe's Hand-writing, with the Corrections, in That of Dr. Young, is left for Inspection at the Shop of the Publisher." The 70-line Proem is addressed to John Stuart (1713-1792), the third Earl of Bute, styled Pollio in the poem (pp. 1-5); in it, Dodington eulogizes the virtues of his deceased friend John Duke of Argyll, Bute's maternal uncle. The Epistle offers 294 lines on wisdom and cunning and their consequences (pp. 7-25), which briefly address the youthful Pollio in the opening and refer to the young King George III in the close. The texts of both the Proem and the Epistle have respectively 21 and 50 readings in italic, varying in length from a word (38 of the total) to a couplet, preceded by a number that refers to alternate readings at the foot. Becket does not indicate what the footnotes represent. The reader may well suppose that the text is entirely Dodington's original with Young's corrections placed in the footnotes. However, it is also possible that Becket printed the revised text incorporating Young's suggestions and that he placed Dodington's rejected original readings in the footnotes. Several authors have assumed that the footnotes contain Young's revisions, including a writer for The Critical Review, Lloyd Sanders (Dodington's biographer), and Harold Forster (Young's biographer). 4 That ascription, I think, is suggested by the title phrase "With Corrections" (as opposed, say, to "As Corrected by"), and, as I shall argue, there is some evidence that the footnotes are Young's corrections. But never has the authenticity of Becket's edition been examined. The poem itself deserves some attention: The Monthly Review said it "has some merit, and some morality in it. It is, really, as decent a thing as one could expect from a Lord." 5 Also, no one has yet examined the nature of Young and Dodington's collaboration, even though a fairly clear record of it remains. Although Becket's printer's copy has been lost, the Lewis Walpole Library of Yale University possesses a manuscript version of the Epistle to Bute bound with a signed autograph letter from Young to Dodington dated 17 October 1761 and referring to the poem. The poetical manuscript, which I will argue postdates that version printed in 1776, and the letter from Young to Dodington dated 17 October 1761, along with another dated 6 October 1761, substantiate most of Becket's claims for his source. However, these documents question Becket's claim that his copy "bears [the] Date the 26th of October 1761" or at least deny that date's accuracy. For, as I shall argue, the letter dated 6 October accompanied the return of a corrected manuscript (presumably that printed by Becket), and the second, dated 17 October, refers to a later version of the Epistle to Bute than that reprinted by Becket. 6 The poetical manuscript at the Lewis Walpole Library (LWL), though it has received little attention and never been printed, conflates the readings in both the text and footnotes of Becket's edition. By examining the printed text and its footnotes, the manuscript version of the poem, and several of Young's letters relating to the poem and to another of Dodington's poetical compositions, we are able to understand much about Dodington's composition and Young's collaboration. This examination will also answer the great question raised by the Becket edition, indicating which of Young's suggestions were incorporated by the author. The LWL manuscript, bound with a front endpaper and Young's letter of 17 October, is written throughout in the same scribal hand on 16 numbered folio pages. The proem is prefaced by the head-title, 'Of Wisdom &amp; Cunning | &amp; their Consequences | True &amp; False Greatness | Lord M. to the Earl of Bute. &amp;c | Quos irrupta [ sic ] tenet Copula. Hor:' [.] 7 Above the title, presumably in the eighteenth century, a hand extraneous to the manuscript and in a different ink has written the date '1760'. W. S. Lewis, who purchased the manuscript in 1925, 8 has written inside the front cover that the date '1760' is in Horace Walpole's hand. However, that date cannot be right since, as Walpole probably knew, Dodington did not become Baron Melcombe of Melcombe Regis, Dorsetshire, until 6 April 1761, 9 about the time Bute, already prominent in the administration, became Secretary of State for the Northern Department. Possibly the date was inscribed by Henry Penruddock Wyndham, Dodington's relation who inherited Dodington's papers, and published an abridgement of his diary in 1784. Two notes on the front endpaper are both in Wyndham's hand, the first initialed by him. The '6' and '7' in the '67' of the first note distinctly resemble those characters in the date '1760': Compare the following Epistle to Lord Bute, with the Epistle to Pollio (S r Rob. Walpole George 1 st [or 's vt' ]) in the Mss. collection of Poems, Page 67. HP.W. It also appears by the inclosed papers that, during the Interval of the Administrations of Sr. Rob: Walpole &amp; Lord Bute, the Epistle had been addressed to Frederick, Prince of Wales. These notes assert that the Epistle proper was largely composed long before 1761. Although the first note does not explicitly say this epistle is the same as another addressed to Sir Robert, "also" in the second note might imply such. Furthermore, Horace Walpole noted in the margins of his copy of Dodington's Diary (1784) that Wyndham "wrote to Joseph Warton in 1784 that he had found among Dodington's papers an old copy of the poem, but inscribed to Sir Robert Walpole." 10 However, it is possible that Wyndham confused the epistle later sent to Bute with a fair copy of Dodington's published Epistle to Sir Robert Walpole . If the epistle on wisdom and cunning were written before Dodington parted company with Sir Robert Walpole, we must wonder why it was not published more than two decades before Young saw it, for Dodington had had no hesitation about publishing an epistle to Walpole. Although this poetical manuscript addressed to Walpole is not extant and Dodington's Proem to Bute must date from around 1761, there is no evidence to deny Wyndham's claim that Dodington had addressed to Frederick an earlier version of the Epistle, presumably during his two years as chief advisor to the Prince before his death in 1751. Sanders, knowing of the manuscript now at LWL, assumed the footnotes of the 1776 edition were Young's revisions and concluded that the LWL manuscript "apparently represents the form in which Melcombe wished his 'Epistle' should be given to the world, because many of Young's emendations have been adopted in it [the LWL manuscript], while others have been discarded" (p. 260). Sanders, who misdates the edition "1766," does not offer any textual evidence that the notes contain Young's readings, but his assessment seems correct. With and without reference to the manuscript, one can find evidence in the edition to argue Young's alterations are in the notes. The footnote to the word "narrows" in line 28 of the Epistle ("narrows" is also the LWL manuscript reading) is "strangles, or smothers." It seems more likely that Young offered two alternate readings than that Dodington had. Also, a few footnotes with readings shared by the manuscript are obvious corrections, like the replacement of the unidiomatic "in prey" with "a Prey" at line 29 of the Epistle. Although the footnoted readings contain no additions and are nearly all rephrasings, some of these verbal alterations seem characteristic of Young, and none are uncharacteristic. At line 32 of the Epistle, where the manuscript and footnotes share the word "Toils," the printed text has "Moyls," which is a word very uncommon, if ever present, in Young's writings. The footnote reading "These Fiends" referring to personified emotions and conditions resembles Young's calling sorrow "that foul Fiend" in Resignation , written within a year of this revision. 11 The best stylistic evidence involves twelve footnotes making substitutions for the relative conjunction and pronoun "that," in nine instances with "which." (The manuscript accepted ten of the changes, rejecting the use of "It" in Epistle, line 44, and "which" in Proem, line 38). Although Young often used 'That' as a demonstrative, he rarely used it as a relative pronoun. For example, in the first 708 lines of the second edition of Resignation , "that" appears as a relative five times, half as often as it is used as an adjective and demonstrative pronoun; whereas, "which" is employed as a relative pronoun twenty-one times. Although it cannot identify who did what, textual criticism can show that the manuscript represents a version later than that published, one incorporating readings from both the printed text and footnotes and introducing others not found in either source. In the 71 passages with variant readings between the printed text and the footnotes, the LWL manuscript shares substantive readings with the footnotes on 47 occasions, shares all but one substantive (taken from the printed text) with the footnotes on 1 occasion, and shares or largely shares the substantives of the printed text on 22 others. 12 In the remaining case, Epistle, lines 45-46 (discussed below), it divides its fidelity equally between the printed text and footnotes. On four pages all the footnoted readings are like the manuscript's, but on one page with seven footnotes (page 3) all the readings in the poetic text are more like the manuscript's. If the LWL manuscript had preceded the copy Young corrected, the press would have had to have inconsistently placed Young's and Dodington's readings. For example, on pages B1 r and B1 v in both the printed text and the footnotes individual lines agree with and differ from those on manuscript pages five and six. This varying conformity cannot be explained by any division of work (by manuscript pages or by printed formes or pages) between one or more compositors confused about where to put Dodington's original readings and Young's emendations. 13 Furthermore, variant readings to lines 45-46 of the Epistle found in the printed text, printed footnotes, and the LWL manuscript can best be understood by assuming the manuscript to be an eclectic text produced from the text and annotations printed in 1776: Where Judgment tempers Wit's enliv'ning blaze, And Genius quickens what Reflection weighs. (printed text; my italics here and below) From Judgment temp'ring Wit's excessive blaze, And Genius bright'ning what Reflection weighs. (footnote) Where Judgment tempers Witts enlivening Blaze, And Genius brightens what Reflection weighs. (LWL manuscript) If the LWL manuscript were composed prior to the printer's copy annotated by Young, then Young would have guessed Dodington's original but since-changed readings in either lines 45 or 46. If the printed text records Young's readings, Young chose 'enliv'ning' in line 45, the word Dodington would have formerly used but had since replaced with 'excessive'. If the footnotes record Young's readings, Young chose 'bright'ning' in line 46, much the same wording Dodington would have formerly used but had since replaced with 'quickens'. To make sense of these alternate readings, we must suppose Dodington produced the LWL couplet from his and Young's earlier attempts, later recorded in 1776. Not surprisingly, the manuscript at line 46 does not agree precisely with the phrasing of either the printed text or footnotes. About a dozen readings in the manuscript are independent of either source, and, a few, including additional lines, must be later revisions. 14 Of course, some substantive variants are probably compositorial errors. The compositor's fallibility is evident at line 62 of the Epistle, where a paragraph begins with the second line of a couplet. That the LWL manuscript reflects the author's final intentions seems likely to judge from the quality of its variants. In revising to compose the LWL version, Dodington chose the better of at least several alternatives offered by his original text (extant as the printed text) and Young's emended version (extant as the footnotes). For example, lines 9-10 of the Proem have a faulty rhyme in the printed text that the footnote corrects with a simple shift of words. One cannot imagine anyone proposing the printed text as a correction for the footnote: Trace ev'ry feature of the fav'rite piece, Revive his Grace, his Dignity, and Ease; (printed text) Each feature of the fav'rite picture trace, Recall his Ease, and Dignity, and Grace; (footnote) Not surprisingly, the LWL manuscript shares substantives with the footnote except for retaining the reading 'his' before 'Dignity'. Or, again, in lines 43-44 of the Proem, where the now heavenly Argyll is eulogized as a model for conduct, the manuscript shares the footnote's substantives, which regularize the meter and simplify the complex syntax in the printed text: From thence, while, darkling, we thy Star survey, Thy bright Example marks and lights the way. (printed text) Thence let thy bright Example's brilliant ray To Wisdom point, and light us on our way. (footnote) It would usually be presumptuous to judge when Dodington made right or wrong choices or what readings are characteristically Young's or Dodington's; however, these stylistic judgments add some support to the textual arguments. When the manuscript rejects what strike me as superior readings, these are more often in the printed text (as at line 193). 15 In these cases one must suppose Dodington's better judgment acquiesced to either Young's friendship or poetical success. That inclination is also evident in the manuscript's agreeing twice as often with the footnotes as with alternative readings in the printed text. Before supporting the likelihood of Dodington's accepting Young's corrections, I would digress to argue the improbability of the LWL manuscript being the product, not of Dodington, but of an editor possessing the manuscript that Young annotated. This possibility need be admitted since the LWL manuscript is not a Dodington autograph to judge from comparison of it with autographs of Dodington's diaries, parliamentary speeches, and letters. 16 If only because of Young's contemporary status, it seems more likely that an owner editing the annotated manuscript would accept all Young's changes or none than that he would labor to produce an eclectic text. Moreover, the manuscript's being bound with Young's letter of 1761 suggests that it was produced for or by Dodington, as does Wyndham's possession of the manuscript in the 1780's. The modest abbreviation "Lord M." in its title suggests the manuscript was prepared for Dodington. And there are readings peculiar to the LWL manuscript, like the motto, requiring an unlikely boldness on the part of an editor. For example, in the Proem, line 38, the LWL manuscript has 'Hearts' where the printed text and footnotes have 'Soul'; in the Epistle, line 290, it has 'Virtue' where they have 'Glory'; and in the Epistle, line 14, it has 'Th'Imperial Murderer' where the printed text has 'The purple Murderer' and the footnote reads '[The] royal Butcher'. Dodington's inclination to accept the majority of Young's suggestions while yet rejecting many others is also evident in the collaboration on Dodington's verses "Kind Companion." A week or so after receiving Young's final revisions of the Epistle to Bute , Dodington sent Young, perhaps partly in thanks, verses addressed to and commending Young, apparently along with the Horatian ode "Shorten Sail," which they would preface. 17 After Young expressed his appreciation in an untraced letter, possibly with some suggested revisions, Dodington on 27 October 1761 sent Young a fair copy of these verses: "Ye seem'd to like the Ode I sent you for your Amusement, I now send it you as a Present. If you please to accept of it, and are willing our Friendship should be known when we are gone you will be pleas'd to leave this among those of your Papers, which may possibly see the Light by a posthumous Publication" (Pettit, 550-551). Two days later Young asked Dodington if the verses might be "Prefixed" to the second edition of Resignation , "considering the Similar Contents of Both." (Dodington rejected Young's proposal, insisting upon posthumous publication.) More significantly, Young added a postscript with suggested revisions for that set of verses addressed to himself: Genius Soars, &amp; virtue guides Where Omnipotence resides Suppose it was thus He who Parts &amp; Virtue gave, Bad thee Look beyond the Grave; Genius Soars, &amp; Virtue guides, When the Love of God presides. There's a Gulph twixt us, &amp; God Let the dreadfull Path be trod, Why stand Shivring on the Shore? &amp;c. (Pettit, 551-552) When published with the ode in The Public Advertiser of 23 August 1762, the prefatory verses contained in lines 7-13 almost all the changes Young had proposed on 29 October 1761. The published text agrees in all its substantives with that Young sent the Dutchess of Portland on 2 January 1763, claiming that Dodington had sent it to him "scarce a Month before his Death" (Pettit, 565-566). In this final version, Dodington did emend the line "Where Omnipotence resides" much as Young had suggested ("When the Love of God presides"), though he maintained "Where" for "When." The only other substantive difference between the seven lines in Young's letter and those published is Dodington's employment of "gloomy Path," not "dreadful Path." It is curious that Young had used "gloomy Path" with just this meaning in the second edition of Resignation , published in May 1762. 18 Young had sent the revised opening for the second edition to Dodington on 29 October 1761 and would have sent the whole revision upon its publication, but perhaps Dodington's word choice influenced Young's. In any case Young would not have quoted seven lines to correct the third, fourth, and sixth quoted. The first two lines may well be Young's in their entirety, and, also, the seventh line, for Young to have written it out, must contain a substantive revision. The commonplace of moving from the "Shore" on to the ocean of God and righteousness appears in Resignation (2nd edition, pp. 48-49); but then all Dodington's imagery and diction in the two short verses can be found in Young's Resignation . It is as if Dodington had written for Young the sort of poem that he knew Young would have written him. This too suggests a disposition prone to accept Young's recommended changes. When did Dodington compose the Proem to Bute and write or revise the Epistle? The facts of Dodington's friendship with Bute argue that the poetical gift would have been undertaken during the last half of 1761 or the first half of 1762. During 1761 Dodington's friendship with Bute cooled somewhat, but the two remained friends up until Dodington's death on 28 July 1762. Although there is much friendly correspondence between Dodington and Bute during the October when Young revised the poem, the two were not so close as Dodington wished them to be. On 13 April 1762, Dodington wrote Bute, "since the middle of the summer, I found such an alteration, not in your kindness, my dear Lord, but in your confidence, which would have been very grievous" but for Dodington's "unswerving attachment." 19 Dodington supposed he owed "the Diminuition of your [Bute's] Confidence to this false Impression" that Dodington was eager "to gett a Place." He insisted that he was too old to seek the wealth attendant to place. Subsequent correspondence grows increasingly cordial, and on 13 June 1762 Bute offered Dodington the Admiralty. Thus, the Epistle's high moral tone and belief in patriotic service would have served Dodington's need from June 1761 to June 1762 to reassure Bute of the author's motivations and abilities. Young's letters to Dodington suggest that the LWL manuscript was produced between 6 and 17 October 1761. Also, the letters suggest that the collaboration was no more the product of friendship than the means to renew it. Young seems to have returned the corrected manuscript—presumably that used by Becket—with his letter of 6 October. Referring only generally to the poem, the letter implies Young's distance from, yet warmth toward, Dodington: Indeed; my good &amp; honourd Ld! I have not been in Town since January last.—I probably may be mistaken in my fancy'd amendments; but in truth I have done my best; for I was pleas'd &amp; proud of the Task. There is much Noble &amp; Usefull sense in it, Which Will be more applauded than Obey'd. (Pettit, 547) After the complimentary close and signature, a short postscript further remarks: "I know but little of Lord Bute, but admire his Uncle as much as you my dear Lord! God preserve you, &amp; prepare us both for the Urn you mention." That Young saw the Epistle itself is suggested by his calling the work "Noble and Useful," a characterization more proper to it than the Proem. Certainly Young read the Proem. He refers to its lengthy praise of Bute's uncle, John Campbell, the second Duke of Argyll, and the urn he mentions is in line 34 of the Proem. This letter appears to have been written to accompany the revised manuscript. That is particularly suggested by the absence of any other business in the letter, and its being Young's first letter to Dodington for some time, probably the first since at least late April when Dodington was elevated to Baron Melcombe (as is suggested by the playful repetition of "Lord!"). Indeed, aside from Young's requesting that his Conjectures on Original Composition be sent to Dodington in 1759 (Pettit, 495), this letter is the first reference to Dodington in Young's extant correspondence since 1727. Young's letter to Dodington of 17 October contains two specific textual references. Although it was principally written to thank Dodington for the ode "Kind Companion," Young opens the letter with two thoughts regarding the Epistle to Bute and returns to it in concluding. I quote the entire letter since it has only been known from Thomas Warton the Younger's fairly accurate transcription: What, my Good Lord! if it ran thus (viz) --- --- if we can judge aright From a fair Morning of meridian Light. As to y e Other place, y e . 2 Verses you have reinstated sets all Right. I am much obligd by y e . serious Ode You sent me, as I think it introduces me to your Heart; wh I find in good Health. The Ode is a beautifully finisd Piece. We in y e Country stare, &amp; wonder, &amp; look as wise, &amp; as well satisfied as we can; &amp; talk much because we know not what to say. Your thinking some of my Notes not Useless to You, gives me Pleasure for, indeed, I am my Dear &amp; Hon d . Lord Y r Affectionate &amp; much Obligd &amp; most Humble Ser t Oct r . 17. 1761. EYoung There is an Ease &amp; Simplicity in y e above alteration , (wh I think right, Especially in an Epistle) &amp; allmost the Reverse of Flattery. Dodington had evidently sent Young thanks for his emendations, indicating that some of them had been used. This communication probably was accompanied by a text substantially the same as the LWL manuscript, which would show the outcome of Young's labor. That Dodington had sent a new manuscript is evident in Young's reference to Dodington's reinstating two verses. These might well be lines 49-50 of the Epistle, which are transposed and have substantive differences between the manuscript and the footnotes. They are the only lines found in different positions in the manuscript and either the printed text or footnotes. As in the printed text where the lines differ only in accidentals, the manuscript reads: "She ["Wisdom"] warrs on Vice alone, &amp; her Decree | Draws not the Sword to fetter, but to free." The footnote reads: "Draws not the sword to fetter, but to free, | And Vice alone is slain by her decree." If, as the footnote suggests, Young had reversed their position, and Dodington had rejected the change, then, in the sense that Young had altered them, Dodington had "reinstated" the verses to their old position, possibly with some revision, so that Young could have been satisfied that they were now set right. More significantly, the three feet of one line and all the following line which Young would change in the concluding couplet ("if we can judge aright | From a fair Morning of meridian Light") are from the only lines of the LWL manuscript not printed in 1776. The printed text ends with the remark that it is the Muse's charge "to praise True Greatness on the Throne, | 'Tis thine, O George! to make that Praise thy own." The couplet added in the manuscript introduces a compliment into the exhortation, ascribing some "true Greatness" (l. 293) to young King George III: "And Thine it is, if we can judge Aright, | From Morning Brightness of Meridian Light." Young's remark in the postscript about the "Ease &amp; Simplicity of y e above alteration," though it could refer to the whole revised epistle (i.e., the new manuscript), more probably refers to either of the two changes specifically noted. Since the other change concerns the power of wisdom and cannot raise the issue of flattery, the "alteration" Young referred to must be the concluding couplet. Young's revision reduces somewhat the "brightness" ascribed to King George, and, thus, makes the close less flatterning. This couplet must not have concluded the manuscript Young revised. That would explain why now Young amended it. Also, if it was in the printer's copy, why, when he was intent on faithfully reproducing an old manuscript, did Becket strike the couplet in 1776? Similarly, we may ask why, if the LWL manuscript had preceded the version printed by Becket, didn't he receive and reprint the work's full title and its motto? In summary, Dodington sent Young an epistle on "Wisdom and Cunning" probably drafted at least a decade earlier, along with a recently written proem to the Earl of Bute. Young revised both sets of verses, which were later printed together by Becket with Young's emendations placed in the footnotes. As I have hypothesized, Dodington returned a revised version incorporating most of Young's emendations and adding a closing couplet, this text being either the LWL manuscript or another very similar text. Young commented on two passages in this manuscript and returned it to Dodington. Presumably, Dodington then had a fair-copy drawn up for presentation to the Earl of Bute, possibly inserting Young's suggestion for the final couplet. 20 This collaborative revision was a part of a larger exchange begun when Young sent Dodington his privately printed Resignation around 1 September 1761 (Young recalled the gift on 29 October 1761 [Pettit, 551]). It involved the revision of one or two shorter poems by Dodington and perhaps the second edition of Young's Resignation . The Becket edition of Dodington's Poetical Epistle to the Earl of Bute manifests Young's continued regard for his old friend and patron. But it is the Yale manuscript of this poem, with its incorporation of Young's revisions into the author's final intentions, that testifies to Dodington's esteem for Young.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The imprint reads "London: Printed for T. Becket, Corner of the Adelphi, in the Strand. M DCC LXXVI." The edition collates 4°: i 2 A-C 4 D1 [$1, 2 signed]; pp. [ 4 ] 1 2-5 6-7 8-25 26. Walpole wrote William Mason on 18 February 1776 that he had been given a copy of the epistle, and the editors of Walpole's Correspondence note the poem was announced in The Public Advertiser of 13 February ( Yale Edition of Horace Walpole's Correspondence , Vol. 28, ed. by W. S. Lewis, Grover Cronin, Jr., and Charles Bennet [1955], 242). 2 Dodington's An Epistle to the Right Honorable Sir Robert Walpole was printed by John Walthoe in 1726 (Foxon D371, noting publication December 1725), apparently with press-variant "second-" and "third-" edition title-pages; it was reprinted that year in Dublin (n.p.) and ascribed to Edward Young in a nonce collection advertised by Thomas White-house ( Dublin Weekly Journal , 19 June 1726), and reprinted in London, 1741, by Thomas Cooper. Dodington's "On Sir Robert Walpole's Birth-Day" was printed in Dodsley's A Collection of Poems by Several Hands , volume 4 (1755), 227; on Dodington's authorship, see James Tierney's The Correspondence of Robert Dodsley 1733-1764 (1988), pp. 196-198. Dodington's Horatian ode "Shorten Sail," beginning "Love thy country, wish it well," was reprinted in the Oxford Book of English Verse ed. Arthur Quiller-Couch (1926), p. 508. See footnote 17 below on the likelihood that this ode was sent to Young in 1761. David Foxon notes other poems by Dodington in English Verse 1701-1750 (1975), I, 191. 3 On Dodington and Young's fellowship in a circle of Oxford poets, see Harold Forster's Edward Young: The Poet of the 'Night Thoughts' 1683-1765 (Alburgh Harleston Norfolk: Erskine Press, 1986), pp. 24, 30-31; on Dodington's likely involvement in Young's receiving a pension, see Forster, pp. 97-100. Young's fullest testimony to Dodington's patronage comes in the opening, dedicatory lines of Satire III of The Universal Passion (1725); also, in Satire V (1727), Young referred to composing the poem at Dodington's estate: "these numbers free, / Pierian Eastbury! I owe to thee" (ll. 265-266). Before pulling from production his tragedy The Brothers in 1724, Young remarked to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu that "the players and Mr. Dodington, neither of whom were backward in finding fault, or careless in attention, took no notice" of a flaw she had observed ( The Correspondence of Edward Young 1683-1765 , ed. Henry Pettit [1971], p. 24). 4 The Critical Review , 45 (March, 1776), 230; Sanders, Patron and Place-Hunter: A Study of George Bubb Dodington, Lord Melcombe (1919), p. 260; Forster, p. 345. 5 The Monthly Review , 54 (March, 1776), 241. 6 Pettit, pp. 547-548. Pettit reprinted Thomas Warton the Younger's transcripts of these letters at the British Museum. 7 I thank Librarian Marie Divine of the Lewis Walpole Library for her considerable assistance and Yale University and the Lewis Walpole Library for their kind permission to quote from the manuscripts. The manuscripts of Dodington's Epistle to Bute and Young's A.L.s. of 17 October 1761 are indexed as "HW MSS" in the Lewis Walpole collection. The front endpaper bears W. S. Lewis's bookplate and has annotations by Lewis and Henry Penruddock Wyndham. The motto is from Horace, Odes , I,xiii,18: "Felices ter et amplius / felices quos inrupta tenet copula," or "Thrice happy and more are they whom an unbroken bond unites" ( The Odes and Epodes , transl. C. E. Bennett, Loeb Classical Library [1952], pp. 40-41). In the manuscript the Epistle directly follows the Proem without any spacing, as if they were parts of one long poem, but line numeration begins with the Epistle. 8 John Carswell offers an account of what became of Dodington's papers in the second appendix to The Old Cause: Three Biographical Studies in Whiggism (1954). On the Maggs' Brothers sale (1913) of the manuscript and letter of 17 October, see Pettit, p. 547n; Pettit mistakenly seems to assume, despite his quoting the sale catalogue to the contrary, that the letter of 6 October was also sold at this time, perhaps because Thomas Warton the Younger had transcribed both. Sanders (1919) noted that both the letter of 17 October and manuscript, as well as papers now at Harvard, were once in the collection of "the late Mr. A. M. Broadley" (p. 260; see also p. ix). Lewis indicated inside the front cover that he purchased the manuscript in 1925 from Hodgson. 9 John Carswell and Lewis A. Dralle noted that Dodington's "peerage as Lord Melcombe dated from 6 April" in their edition of The Political Journals of George Bubb Dodington (1965), p. 42on. 10 Walpole records Wyndham's letter to Warton in a note to the long appendix "A Memorial of Several Noblemen and Gentlemen of the first rank and fortune," which he wrote in his copy of Wyndham's edition of Dodington's Diary (Hazen 2837A). Later Lord Holland printed this appendix within his edition of Walpole's Memoirs of the Reign of King George the Second (1846). More recently, it was reprinted as Appendix 5 in volume 3 of the Memoirs of King George II , ed. John Brooke (1985), pp. 159-162. 11 Epistle, line 193. The comparable phrasing in Resignation was added to the second edition, p. 20, line 14, quoted in footnote 14 below. Young speaks of revising Resignation for the second edition in his letter to Dodington of 29 October 1761 (Pettit, 551), though the edition was not published until about the time it was entered in the Stationers' Register, 23 May 1762. 12 The LWL manuscript shares the substantive readings of the printed text in the following occasions where footnotes provide alternatives: Proem, lines 14, 27 *, 28, 31 *, 32, 34, 38 *, 40, 51-52, 54; Epistle, lines 14 *, 18, 22, 28, 44, 49-50, 57, 102, 134, 135, 244, 273-274. The asterisks indicate the manuscript's incomplete fidelity to the printed text's substantives; some of these changes are recorded in footnote 14 below. With two exceptions, the manuscript faithfully adopts the substantives of all the other footnoted readings. One exception is at Epistle, lines 45-46, discussed below; the other is in the Proem, lines 9-10, where the manuscript, like the printed text, has 'his Dignity' for 'and Dignity'. 13 On B1 r (with lines 25-38 of the Epistle) the printed text (PT) agrees with the LWL manuscript (MS) in line 28, and the footnotes (FN) agree with the MS in lines 32, 35, and 37. On B1 v (with lines 39-52) the PT agrees with the MS in lines 44-46 and 49-50 and the FN agree with the MS in lines 42 and 52. The alternating agreement of the PT and FN with the MS occurs in all printed formes of the book. The fifth page of the MS begins with line 15, the sixth with line 39. 14 Substantive readings unique to the LWL manuscript are: the head-title; in the Proem, in lines 27 ('o'er' for 'to'), 29 ('Oh much, &amp; long' for 'Oh! long and much'), 31 ('Th'Effusion' for 'Th'effusions' in the printed text [PT] and 'The fulness' in the footnotes [FN]), and 38 ('That flood our Hearts, &amp; swell into our Eyes' for 'That flood the Soul, and swell the Eyes' in the PT and 'Which melt the Soul, and swell the Eyes' in the FN); and, in the Epistle, at lines 14 ('Th'Imperial Murderer' for 'The purple Murd'rer' in the PT and 'The royal Butcher' in the FN), 25 ('withers Statemen's' for 'blights the Stateman's' in the PT and 'withers Statesman's' in the FN), 46 ('brightens' for 'quickens' in the PT and 'bright'ning' in the FN), 83 ('Mansion' for 'mansions'), 144 ('Consists' for 'Consist'), 290 (the erroneous 'Tract' for the 'track'), 292 ('Virtue' for 'Glory'), 295-296 (two lines added, unique to the manuscript; discussed below in the text). 15 For example, the manuscript follows the footnote in replacing the ironic 'Chos'n Friends' with the tired phrase 'These Fiends' in a catalogue of personified vices: "See Ribald Mirth, and Begg'ry void of shame, | Demure Detraction, and loud-bawling Blame, | Chos'n Friends! by Int'rest rank'd, in order stand" (Epistle, lines 191-193). 16 As compared to the manuscript, Dodington's handwriting in his diary and various speeches (Harvard MS Eng 188 and MS Eng 188.5f) and letters from 1760 (within the library of the Marquess of Bute) is less florid and ornate. 17 All the references in Dodington's and Young's correspondence during October 1761 speak of Dodington's sending one composition, which Dodington calls an ode. Young quotes from only those verses to him beginning "Kind Companion" which are not an ode. However, after sending the Dutchess of Portland the "Kind Companion" verses on 2 January 1763, Young sent her on 13 January the Horatian ode sometimes called "Shorten Sail," which begins "Love thy Country." In sending the first, Young remarked that Dodington had sent it "scarce a Month before his Death," and, in sending the second, he indicated that it was sent "at the same time with the Former" (Pettit, pp. 565 and 567, respectively). Assuming Young recalled accurately the date of the gift, we can only suppose that in October 1761 he had also received copies of both compositions, though that seems likely given Dodington's reference to "the Ode" (see below in the text). In his edition of Young, James Nichols reprinted both poems on the strength of Herbert Croft's claim in his account of Young in Johnson's Lives of the Poets : "Croft informs us, that the verses which precede this 'ode' were only an introduction to what is called, in the third couplet, 'the Muse's latest spark'" ( Complete Works, Poetry and Prose [1854; fasc. rpt. Hildesheim: Olms, 1968], II, 83). 18 P. 41. The phrase "gloomy Way" is to be found in the first edition of Resignation (n.p., privately distributed in early September, 1761): "To Peace, thro' Truths austere, we work | Our rugged, gloomy Way" (p. 7), but I have not found "gloomy path" there. 19 Carswell and Dralle, pp. 437-438. 20 Alexander Hunter, the archivist in the library of the Sixth Marquess of Bute, Lord John Crichton-Stuart, Mount Stuart, was unable to locate a manuscript of Dodington's epistle among extant papers sent by Dodington to the third Earl of Bute.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Greek Tragedy with a Happy Ending: The Publication of Robert Potter's Translations of Aeschylus, Euripides, and Sophocles by David Stoker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The middle years of the eighteenth century saw the decline of the system of literary patronage and the emergence of authorship as a full-time profession. However, patronage did not die overnight, and throughout the eighteenth century there were plenty of authors whose works of scholarship could not command substantial sums from the booksellers, and indeed might never have been published on a commercial basis. Such writers continued to look to patrons for financial assistance either to supplement their limited incomes or else to underwrite the production costs of their works. The various ways in which literary patronage operated, and on occasions failed to operate, in the later years of the eighteenth century are well illustrated by the career of Robert Potter. According to his draft autobiography in the National Library of Wales (Ms 125021, Wigfair 21) he was born in 1721 at Podimore in Somerset, the third son of a Prebendary of Wells Cathedral. For more than forty years he held various meagre livings, notably as the Curate of the village of Scarning in Norfolk, where he also ran a boarding school. Potter was also a poet, critic, and the translator of Greek drama, as well as a writer of works of political and social commentary. He is now remembered primarily as a translator and critic rather than as a poet, but he had literary talents in several fields, which were only partly recognised by his contemporaries. 1 He was a witty and perceptive correspondent and conversationalist, displaying a lively interest in all aspects of contemporary literature, drama and the arts. According to the antiquary Craven Ord, he was "Narrow in his circumstances; with a disaggreable [sic] wife—he is rather an entertaining &amp; well behaved gentleman, with some singularities of thinking" (B.L. Addl. Ms. 14823 fo.137). Potter's abilities went largely unnoticed for the first fifty-seven years of his life. Then in 1777-78 he achieved fame among polite and educated society with his verse translation of the tragedies of Aeschylus, the first to have been undertaken into English. As a result of the critical acclaim awarded to this work, Potter was taken up by literary society in London and encouraged to undertake similar translations of the remaining Greek tragedians—Euripides and Sophocles. According to John Nichols ( Literary Anecdotes , II.306) Potter was "a scholar of the old school; and nothing tempted him to relinquish divine and polite literature." He never expected to profit directly from his writings, yet much of this work was undertaken with the aim of seeking preferment within the church. Whilst he was ultimately successful in this objective, he had to wait more than a decade and suffer many disappointments before he reaped any reward for his considerable labours. By the mid-1770s Robert Potter was perhaps beginning to feel that life had passed him by, and he had not been able to fulfil his early promise. He was midway through his sixth decade and had published a number of works at his own expense, 2 but without having achieved any great literary reputation, or advanced to any extent within his profession. In spite of holding several poor livings and the office of schoolmaster at the village of Scarning, his total income was always relatively small and barely kept pace with the living costs of a minor gentleman. Above all, it had not enabled him to amass any legacy for his children. Yet he could point to friends of his youth who, although from similar backgrounds, had fared much better in life. His school fellow Edward Thurlow, although ten years his junior, was then Attorney General, and would shortly become Lord Chancellor. Likewise Richard Hurd, with whom he had studied at Emmanuel College, had since risen to become Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry. In spite of his lack of financial success Potter continued to publish his own poetry, and had contributed to The new foundling hospital for wit (London, 1771). He also appears to have continued a particular interest in Greek drama, which he gained at school. In December 1773 he sent to the press an octavo edition of his collected Poems (London, 1774). This work reprinted most of his existing published verses but also included a blank verse translation of a chorus from the Hecuba of Euripides. It was published a few months later for a respectable number of subscribers. It also contained the important announcement that there was "preparing for the Press, by the same Author, a translation of the intire Tragedies of Euripides". Greek drama had not been much read or appreciated in England during the first half of the eighteenth century. Although Pope's translation of Homer in particular had done much to popularize Greek narrative poetry among those who did not have a sufficient grasp of the language, until the second half of the century the dramatists had been largely overlooked. 3 There had been a prose translation of Sophocles by George Adams published in 1729, but this appears to have had very little impact on Hellenic studies. However, the appearance of Thomas Francklin's edition of the tragedies of Sophocles in 1758-59 did awaken public interest in the genre. A translation of Euripides was therefore the obvious next step for a classical scholar such as Potter who wished to establish a reputation. Whereas "in the early and mideighteenth century Sophocles was generally awarded the palm; later when sensibility took the place of good sense, the tender Euripides was preferred" (Clarke, 147). Potter was not the only scholar whose interest in Euripides had been awakened. Writing to Elizabeth Montagu on 12 December 1782, he explained: . . . in February following [ie.1774] Mr [Michael] Wodhull announced the same intention; and my bookseller at that time sent Dr [Edward] Harwood's proposals: I had at that time some of the tragedies ready for the press, I would not publish them, though much urged to it by my friends, nor precipitate a volume, but gave these gentlemen a clear stage, and finished Aeschylus, which I had intended for the second task well knowing it would be most popular. (Huntington Library MO 4164) Potter may have been writing with the benefit of hindsight in his judgment that Aeschylus would be the more popular translation. According to Clarke (151), "Aeschylus was commonly regarded as a venerable monument of antiquity, one whose works were good in their day but were surpassed by the latter dramatists". In the event Wodhull's translation of Euripides did not appear until 1782, and Harwood did not complete his version. Nevertheless Potter's limited free time over the next three years was spent translating the plays of Aeschylus into blank verse, which task was completed early in 1777, when he advertised for subscribers: As this bold and animated writer, the father of the drama, hath never yet appeared in an English dress, the translator flatters himself that his attempt will be acceptable to the public. The work will be immediately put to the press, and shall be elegantly printed in one volume quarto. Price to the subscribers one guinea in boards, to be paid on delivery of the book. Subscriptions taken in by Mr T. Payne, Mews Gate; Mr Dodsley Pall-Mall; Mr White Fleet-street; and Mr Wilkie, St Paul's Church-yard, London; Messrs T. &amp; Mr Prince Oxford; Mr Hazard at Bath; Mr Balfour in Edinburgh; the Booksellers in Dublin; and by J. &amp; C. Berry Norwich. ( Norwich Mercury 1 March 1777.) The Tragedies of Aeschylus was to be a work on a far greater scale than any of his previous publications and required in the region of eighty printed sheets. As a relatively unknown author, he had to cover the cost of production for his own publication, but he did not have sufficient capital to finance a project on this scale. The number of copies printed is not known but is most unlikely to have been more than the six hundred ultimately subscribed for. The author might have requested part payment from his subscribers in advance, but had he done so it is certain he would not have secured nearly so many promises. The whole system of taking subscriptions in advance had fallen into disrepute long before Potter's time. Instead, he chose to produce the work as cheaply as might be acceptable to his aristocratic subscribers. He did this by dealing directly with a local printer (John Crouse of Norwich, the proprietor of the Norfolk Chronicle newspaper) rather than entrusting the whole work to the supervision of a wholesale bookseller in London, such as James Dodsley. He also included only the translation together with a minimal introduction, without benefit of the usual commentary or scholarly apparatus. Throughout 1777 the translator used all the influence he could muster and managed to gather a respectable number of subscribers for such a work. Bishop Hurd, Potter's friend from University, was appointed Preceptor to the Prince of Wales and his brother Prince Frederick in 1776. He appears to have used his influence in getting them to subscribe together with the Duchess of Cumberland. Yet in spite of the work's subsequent critical success, nearly one hundred of the copies which had been subscribed for through Dodsley were not in fact purchased and had to be disposed of separately over the next year (see below). The Tragedies of Aeschylus was advertised in the Public Advertiser for 23 December 1777 and appears to have been an overnight success among educated society. In January 1778 Horace Walpole wrote to his friend the poet William Mason, There is a Mr Potter too, I don't know who, that has published a translation of Aeschylus, and as far as I have looked is a good poet. I am sure he has taste, for in his preface he speaks like an initiate of Elfrida and Caractacus. I am delighted with Prometheus though I do not approve of a mad cow for first woman. 4 Soon afterwards it received a favourable review in the Gentleman's Magazine (XL, 34-35), and in March, James Harris, one of the first Britons to study Greek philosophy, and author of Hermes , wrote from the House of Commons, to congratulate the translator: "I have perused a large part of your fine translation of Aeschylus, and, had I been happy in knowing you before publication, I should have thought it an honour to have my name appear in your list of subscribers" (B.L. Addl. MS 4079 f.70). According to James Boswell, Potter's work was the topic of conversation between Harris, David Garrick, and Samuel Johnson on April 9 of that year ( Life of Johnson [Oxford, 1969], 920-921). Harris defended the work, whilst Johnson described the little he had read as verbiage (a word not to be found in his dictionary), but he nevertheless agreed to read a play. Before he died in 1779, Garrick is also reputed to have wanted to stage Potter's unpublished translation of Euripides' Hecuba , and went to some expense in procuring costumes. However the plan had ultimately to be abandoned because of the cost of the accompanying Greek chorus (letter from Daniel Watson to John Carr, 2 April 1788, in John Nichols, Illustrations of literary history of the eighteenth century [1817-58], I.431). In his short introduction to Aeschylus, Potter quoted several lines from an essay on Shakespeare, written by one of his subscribers, which he described as "the amiable candor of a fine writer". This compliment to Elizabeth Montagu, the rich and influential leader of society in London, was singularly well placed. As a result she befriended the poor country curate and introduced him to some of the most famous names of literary society. She also undertook to encourage and assist him in his future work. Thus society's verdict on Potter's translation of Aeschylus was indeed favourable, and may perhaps be summed up by the opinion of the Scottish poet James Beattie, writing to Mrs Montagu 1st February 1779: I did not think it possible to do justice to the old Grecian in any modern tongue; but Mr Potter has satisfied me that I was mistaken. It seems to me, that this is indisputably the best translation that ever appeared in English of any Greek poet. I beg, madam you will exert all your influence with the author, to make him go on with Euripides. 5 Nevertheless the publication as a whole was considered by Harris, Mrs Montagu and others to be flawed because of the lack of commentary and footnotes. Such elucidatory notes were then judged to be an essential appendage to such a work. As Harris suggested, If I might venture to hazard a wish upon what you have already done so ably, my wish would have been that you had subjoin'd a few notes of the historical &amp; mythological kind, such as might have assisted un-informed readers. This for their use that translation, and, above all, that of antient authors seems principally to be calculated; and when they want such helps, I know they are often disappointed. (B.L. Addl. MS 4079 f.70) This point was also made in George Colman's otherwise favourable review of the work in the Monthly Review (LIX [1778], 286): "It were to have been wished also, that to the version of an author so difficult as Aeschylus, the Translator had subjoined copious notes, instead of penuriously stinting his readers to a meagre preface to the work, and spare introductions to each play". Potter considered such detailed commentary to be an unnecessary fashion of 'polite literature' and had no particular wish to compile these notes, particularly as the work was now published. 6 However, when the bookseller Thomas Cadell added the additional incentive of purchasing the copyright of a second, annotated, edition of Aeschylus , Potter felt he could not easily refuse the requests he had received. He explained his position in letters written 13 March and 14 May 1778 to his friend Samuel Parr, Master of the Norwich Grammar School (John Johnstone ed., The works of Samuel Parr [1818], 227-228.) At the desire of some persons, of such rank that their requests have the force of commands, I am engaged in writing notes to the English Aeschylus: this is much against my own judgment, as I think with Mr Gray, that notes are an affront to the reader's understanding, and I am sure that every one knows, or ought to know, whatever I know. . . . I write notes most furiously, but they are chiefly in the style of the ingenious and praiseworthy Mr Newbery, 7 for masters and misses: some few must necessarily be critical; such as they are shall be printed in quarto, and presented to the subscribers before the second edition is published, to avoid the common complaint against authorism and booksellerism. It is remarkable that the author's sense of justice to his original subscribers demanded that he must therefore give away copies of the notes which were to be included in the second edition. In a letter to Mrs Montagu on 4 April 1778, however, the author sought to take advantage of his new-found patron in more ways than one: you expressed a desire that notes explanatory of the antient mythology, history, customs &amp;c might be added to the English Aeschylus. Tho' I think that every body knows, or ought to know, whatever I know; and I am certain that you want notes the least of any person alive, yet in deference to your judgment a second edition is preparing with notes: . . . I have consulted many books on the explanation of the antient mythology, but find very little satisfactory; Mr Bryant has more good sense than all of them put together, . . . Mr de Gebelin's Monde Primitif might also be of use to me; but it is not to be met with in the country; you will therefore give me leave to avail my self of the liberty you gave me, and beg the favour of you to send it to me; if the book be scarce &amp; valuable (I know nothing of it) it shall carefully be returned to you. With this Dr Burton's Pentalogia will be very acceptable. 8 By the Norwich Coach from the Swan with two Necks in Lad Lane, to be left at Mr Berry's, Bookseller, Norwich. With regard to this second edition of Aeschylus I am under some difficulties; thro' the disingenuity of Mr Dodsley the unsold copies of the Qto edition, about 100, remain my property; these should be sold before the Book be republished; my friends assisting me in this will do me the same favour as in solliciting subscriptions. But will not my subscribers have reason to think themselves ill treated, if an edition be offered to the public at a less price and, as some may deem it, so much improved? This Consideration has great weight with me, and I know not how to exculpate my self. (Huntington Lib. MO 4155) Mrs Montagu took one of the hints and supplied Potter with the reference works, but in a further letter a fortnight later she needed to be reminded of the great trouble and the additional cost to which she was subjecting her protégé. I write notes most furiously, and have gone thro' two of the Tragedies. Mr Cadell is desirous of having the notes so as to be ready with his new edition by the beginning of November and I fear that I shall not be able to prevail on him to defer the publication till February so that what of the Quarto edition is unsold at that time will become of little value. I fear too that I must be at the expence of printing these notes to present them to my subscribers, that they may have no cause of complaint. (Huntington Lib. MO 4156) By June eighty-five quarto pages of notes and commentary were completed without any decision being made as to their publication. One thing was clear, however: since the notes (and more particularly the notes to the notes) contained a substantial amount of Greek, it would not be possible for them to be entrusted to the original Norwich printer, John Crouse. Their publication and distribution to the original subscribers would therefore involve a printer in London or one of the University presses. Again he wrote to Elizabeth Montagu with a heavy hint: I cannot deny my self the honour of telling you that last night after four months close application I finished the rough draught of the notes on Aeschylus: these are to be transcribed for the press against the second week in July, when they will be printed separately in Quarto as an appendix to the present edition, &amp; given to the subscribers; a copy or two shall be sent to Hill Street; I wish you may find any thing in them worth your attention; few of them are critical, and those will give offence as they differ from a favorite annotator; 9 the rest are explanatory of the antient mythology, history, and customs alluded to by the author: . . . I have the ambition to wish to dedicate to Mrs Montagu; indeed I now write purposely to request that favour; be not under apprehensions, your delicacy shall not be hurt with dedicationlanguage; only permit me the honour of devoting to you the notes, the translation, and the translator. (Huntington Lib. MO 4157) On this occasion he was not disappointed, and Mrs Montagu agreed to pay the publication costs. He wrote to thank her and report upon progress, 14 July 1778: Late on Saturday night I finished the transcript of the notes on Aeschylus; they are sent to the University Press at Cambridge, that the many Greek quotations may have a chance to be correct; as soon as the work is finished, Mr Archdeacon's 10 account of charges shall be sent to you. What shall I say of your generous, noble ---. I believe the less is said, the more acceptable it will be to such a mind; mine is deeply gratefull. (Huntington Lib. MO 4158) Potter informed his nephew John Conway Potter that by 19 August 1778 the University printers "are got forward as far as Agamemnon; they will be finished in a fortnight," (N.L.W. Ms. 12433, Wigfair 33D letter 1), but as usual with assurances from printers this was overly optimistic. By 5 October he had still not seen a copy, although he reported to Elizabeth Montagu that "Mr Dodsley will have a parcell this week" (Huntington Lib. MO 4159). Both the original translation and the subsequent notes were reviewed in the Monthly Review (LIX [1778] 286, 486) by the dramatist and translator George Colman, but whereas the translation was commended, Potter was accused of having compiled the notes "with reluctance" and "too drily and stiffly", whilst occasionally debasing his style with "low expressions" and "familiar French phrases". However, far more fulsome tribute to the notes was forthcoming from his friend Samuel Parr. I am happy to find that you perform the less task with propriety as well as the greater with dignity, and that your labour as commentator will not disgrace your reputation as translator. I speak the language of my serious and most fixed conviction, when I say that the soundness of your understanding, the delicacy of your taste, and the brilliancy of your imagination, are strongly marked in evry page of your annotations: they unite elegance with perspicuity, they illustrate the beauties as well as explain the obscurities of your author, and they are happily calculated at once for the information of the unlearned reader and the entertainment of the most learned. (Johnstone, The works of Samuel Parr [1828], 228-229) Parr did however go on to censure his friend's use of his commentary to praise another Greek scholar, Richard Paul Jodrell, whom he rather described as "the pedant of Berners Street" and a "coxcomb". Jodrell was a London barrister and dramatist, then working on a scholarly commentary on the plays of Euripides. He appears to have befriended Potter after the publication of Aeschylus, and visited him briefly at Scarning in 1779. Robert Potter, now aged fifty-seven, was at the high point of his literary career, and for the first time in his life was a sought-after member of society, with a little spare money from the profits of the first edition and the sale of the copyright for the second octavo edition published by William Strahan and Thomas Cadell in 1779. 11 During the summer of 1778 he even took a brief holiday in London with his son: we spent two evenings at Vaux Hall, one at the Haymarket Theatre, one at Kensington Gardens, the rest with our friends; the days were spent chiefly in rambling from painter to painter, which to me is the highest of all entertainments; Jack sate for his picture to a very pretty young man at Sir Joshua Reynolds', a Mr Doughty; I have a good opinion of it, &amp; expect it home every day. The excellent Romney gave me my head, as a picture a wonderfull fine one, 12 . . . I have done nothing since but saunter; indeed I meditate an attack on Euripides, but the weather is too hot for reading Greek. (N.L.W. Ms. 12433, Wigfair 33D letter 1) The trip also included invitations to literary assemblies, one of which included an introduction by Mrs Montagu to the famous Doctor Johnson whom Potter greatly admired. Unfortunately, Johnson was in one of his ungracious moods and publicly snubbed the poor curate, which humiliation was never thereafter forgotten (E. H. Barker, Literary anecdotes and contemporary reminiscences of Professor Porson and others [London, 1852], I.1-2). 13 However Potter could not for long live on the intellectual capital and meagre profits of his translation of Aeschylus; he wished to consolidate his reputation as a classical scholar. Since nothing had been heard of the projected translations by Wodhull and Harwood since 1775, the obvious next step was a return to Euripides, a task already partially complete. As he explained to Elizabeth Montagu in a letter date 5 October 1778, "I have the deepest sense of your favours; the best return I can think of making you is by attending to Euripides with care, &amp; expediting the translation as fast as I well can, though my servile employment leaves me but little leisure" (Huntington Lib. MO 4159). Mrs Montagu was a useful friend to Potter, who helped him in many ways, but she was not in a position to give him the one thing he most needed—long-term financial security. As she explained to James Beattie, "Mr Potter is now translating Euripides; and, if he succeed as well as in the other translation, the world will owe him a great deal; I heartily wish, that, in some shape, it would pay him part of the debt; he is a man of great merit, small preferment, and large family" (Forbes, An account of the life and writings of James Beattie [London, 1824], 269). This could only come from patronage within the church, and inevitably one of the main reasons for his undertaking this work was in the hope of thereby achieving some recognition. Thus, when the following February he was invited to interrupt work on Euripides in order to assist a man who was in a position to provide such patronage, he did not hesitate to do so, in spite of his previous promises to Mrs Montagu. Potter's notes on Aeschylus had attracted the attention of Hans Stanley, a Privy Councillor and Member of Parliament for Southampton. Stanley was preparing his own translation of Pindar's Odes and wished to employ the curate to oversee the whole and prepare the necessary annotations. 14 Potter did not consider Stanley to be a man of great poetic talent, but the opportunity of making an influential friend was too good to turn down. Between February and August 1779 Potter and Stanley collaborated on the Pindar, whilst in June the former sought to assure Mrs Montagu that he was not neglecting Euripides: This work goes on tolerably well, I suffer nothing to interrupt it, not even my attention to the translation of Pindar though I fear Mr S. thinks me indiligent. I find that Gentleman sensible, a good scholar, well acquainted with his author, and patient under my animadversions; as far as it lies in my poor ability his work shall be kept free from faults; but I fear it will want that rich stream of music which ought to flow deep, majestic, smooth, and strong; he may drive the car of Pindar without overturning it, but he has not The Coursers of ethereal race, With necks in thunder cloath'd, and long-resounding pace. 15 (Huntington Lib. MO 4160.). The collaboration between Stanley and Potter was a success and the project was complete by September 1779; thus the following month the curate who had been overlooked for so many years confided his optimism about his future to his nephew: "I am flattered too with the expectation of being removed from Scarning, but do not too much rely upon the promises of the Great. I work very close upon Euripides, and have not stirred from home all this summer. One volume will be ready this winter" (N.L.W. Ms. 12433, Wigfair 33D letter 5). However in February of the next year he had to confess that his hopes and expectations had been dealt a major setback: My journey to town proved very unfortunate: it was undertaken at the desire of a great man, for whom I had gone through a laborious task, and had the good fortune to please him; he had without sollicitation promised to place me in a more easy station; his power was great, and he was remarkable for his generous spirit and warm attachment where he professed a friendship: the day before I expected him in town the public papers announced his death: so that I not only lost an handsome present, but all my hopes of future preferment. To add to my misfortune, Mrs Montagu was ill, and to go to Bath as soon as she is able; so that Euripides will have little support from her. (N.L.W. Ms. 12433, Wigfair 33D letter 8) Stanley from time to time suffered from chronic depression, which appears to have been a family trait. For like his father before him, he took his own life by slitting his throat. 16 Potter had no choice but to return to Euripides, which task had been set back at least a year. The next mention of the proposed edition of Euripides comes in a letter to his friend, the poet Edward Jerningham, on 30 November 1780, by which time he had finished the text of the first volume and was writing the preface (Huntington Lib. JE 683; Bettany, Edward Jerningham , 332-333). But more specific information was given in a letter to the artist George Romney, written on the Boxing Day following: the [first] Volume of the English Euripides is finished, nay more, it is in the press, and will be published as soon as the printer can get through his work; but I fear this will not be till the end of March; when the book is ready to be delivered, I shall take a journey to town of necessity, as I shall not be able to settle the list of subscribers without waiting in person on some gentlemen who are too great to be addressed by letter, and who, I flatter myself, are friendly to me. (John Romney, Memoirs of the life and works of George Romney [London, 1830], 160) A similar letter was sent to Elizabeth Montagu in February 1781 asking for her help in finalizing the list and thanking some of her aristocratic friends who had been canvassing for subscriptions; my friend in Ireland tells me that the Primate 17 has been in many places before him; I have a very gratefull sense of the honour done me by such a man, and know to whom my first thanks are due for it, and have now to beg the favour of you to request his Grace to send you the names of such Gentlemen as having subscribed thro' his application; if I find this list with you about the end of the next month, when I expect to have the honour of waiting on you, it will be very sufficient. . . . The books will, I expect, be ready to be delivered by the first or second week in April, and I flatter my self that Euripides will be as favourably received as Aeschylus was. (Huntington Lib. MO 4162) The Introduction was dated at Scarning, 2 April, 1781. On the same day Potter wrote a far less optimistic letter to Mrs Montagu. Having made his journey up to town, immediately before publication, he was feeling deeply humbled over the necessity of his being obsequious to such eminent subscribers: The times are indeed very unfavorable to works of literature, perhaps the spirit of the times is worse than the times themselves; besides this, with regard to subscriptions there is an illiberality in many persons not otherwise illiberal, which induces them to think the money they pay is levied upon their charity; though they would be among the first to purchase the book if it were published for a bookseller: this has more than once been suggested to me from under mitres, and may perhaps be a necessary mortification to the natural vanity of a well-received writer; but should I have life and health to publish any thing after the second volume of Euripides, Mr. Dodsley and I will manage as we can, without troubling their Lordships. Notwithstanding this I am so far from complaining, that I have the greatest reasons to be very gratefull for so liberal an encouragement, I am supported by many persons whose names do me the greatest honour, which I have not failed to acknowledge. (Huntington Lib. MO 4163) Nevertheless, the publication of the first volume of Euripides was undoubtedly a success. The list of five hundred and eleven subscriptions was again headed by the Prince of Wales and his brother Prince Frederick, the Archbishops of Canterbury and Armagh (who subscribed for ten and six copies respectively), the Lord Chancellors of England and Ireland, several other Bishops and a large number of the nobility. Potter had also managed to secure the specific patronage of the Duchess of Beaufort, to whom the work was dedicated, and who subscribed for three copies. 18 Mrs Montagu subscribed for a further six copies. The largest single number of subscriptions however was fifteen copies in the name of Hans Stanley, which were presumably delivered to his executor. Although the total number of subscriptions for Euripides was significantly less than for Aeschylus, this work nevertheless should have been the more profitable for Potter. Following the success of his first work, and his reputation as translator, Potter was now able to negotiate the sale of the copyright to the wholesale bookseller James Dodsley, and the agreement is preserved in the British Library (Egerton Ms. 2334 f.19). In lieu of money, he accepted five hundred and twenty-five copies of each volume delivered free of the cost of paper and printing. Thus, before publication he had secured the sale of virtually all his copies, for which he had only to meet the cost of binding. This was fine in theory, but in practice the binding costs had to be paid immediately, whereas the receipts from book sales might take many months to reach him. Thus the following March Potter was writing to his nephew, "I am sorry that the epidemical distemper has reached so far as Denbighshire, I mean the want of money; it rages here, I never was so poorly ; since the first week in January I have not received a guinea; not one of my correspondents, who long ago received Euripidean money for me, will send me a shilling" (N.L.W. Ms. 12433, Wigfair 33D letter 14). During the first three months of 1782 came the next major setback to Potter's career as a translator. The Euripides received an unusually long and detailed review which appeared in the January and March issues of the Critical Review for that year (LIII. 17-28, and 169-173): Euripides, as we observed in a former Review, is undoubtedly of all Greek tragedians, on many accounts, the most difficult to translate. Arduous, however, as the task is, we entertained the most sanguine hopes that Mr Potter, of whose taste, learning, and abilities, we had a favourable opinion, would have been able to perform it. His Aeschylus, though not without faults, was deservedly applauded in the literary world as a performance of no inconsiderable merit; we are sorry to add, that his Euripides is, by no means, equal to it. Whilst allowing that the translation was "tolerably faithful" to the original, the anonymous reviewer attacked the work on the grounds of the lack of perspicuity and elegance: "The colouring is coarse and indelicate, without that grace and softness, that elegance and pathos, which so eminently distinguish the original. . . . This translation, as every reader who has any ear or taste cannot but observe, is too close and literal, and the lines consequently tame, ill-sounding, and prosaical". The reviewer also criticised two fundamental principles adopted by Potter in his translation and explained in the preface. The first of these was his adherence to the convention of Athenian theatre, whereby "in the most interesting and important scenes the dialogue is often thus broken into single lines, each speaker confining himself to his line, sometimes for a long continuance. It is difficult to conceive what grace this amoebean recitative had on the Athenian stage, . . . yet the translator did not think himself at liberty to deviate from the manner of composition prescribed by his author". 19 Secondly the reviewer complained "that the work is very deficient in point of notes: a deficiency which the author has endeavoured in his preface, to apologize for, by observing that "Annotations are not properly the province of the translator.' [see preface, p. xv.] From which assertion we beg to differ". The review ended with the overall assessment that "the first volume of the Translation of Euripides by Mr Potter, is, we will venture to pronounce, upon the whole, a very indifferent performance". In essence, this review disputed Potter's theory of translation and its function, 20 and although there was justice in some of the statements made, it was not perhaps necessary for them to be reiterated at such length. Undoubtedly Potter considered he had been most unfairly treated and that the review stemmed rather from a personal animosity. He was sent copies of the issues of the Critical Review by his friend and neighbour John Fenn of East Dereham. On each occasion Potter wrote to thank him: Alas, who would be an author? But I am not much crest-fallen; there is strong internal evidence which points out to me the writer of this review. I thank you for this review, I am more confirmed in my suspicions of the writer, and at a proper time the objections shall be carefully attended to, and where I find them just, I will avail myself of them. (Letters to John Fenn, 24 February and 11 April 1782. Norfolk Record Office NNAS C3/2/4.) He also outlined his anger and suspicions in a letter to Edward Jerningham of 4 April 1782. You have seen, and doubtless with great indignation, the violent attack of the Critical Reviewers on me; they have shown as much ignorance and want of taste, as want of candour; with such persons I shall enter into no contest, it is not pro dignitate; but I shrewdly suspect, from internal evidence, that this malignity proceeds from Berners Street: is it impossible to ascertain this? Can you put me upon any method to trace it? Could I fix the affront on that learned personage, I should be attempted to make an appeal to the Public. (Huntington Lib. JE 685 and Bettany, Edward Jerningham , 336-337) Potter thus considered the review to be the work of his erstwhile friend Richard Jodrell. He felt betrayed, since he had given his reviewer such fulsome praise in his notes on Aeschylus and had loaned him the translation of Euripides so that Jodrell might have benefit of it when preparing his own Illustrations of Euripides , the first volume of which was published in 1781. 21 However, when in 1786 Jodrell's play The Persian heroine , founded upon Herodotus, was rejected by Drury Lane and Covent Garden because the elucidatory notes occupied as much space as the text, Potter was mightily pleased (letter to Edward Jerningham April 1786 [Huntington Lib. JE 696 and Bettany, Edward Jerningham , 353-354]). Another disappointment occurred in late 1782 with the appearance of Michael Wodhull's complete and long awaited, The nineteen tragedies and fragments of Euripides , in four volumes, before Potter could publish his second volume. Nevertheless Potter considered his own version to be the superior, as he explained to Elizabeth Montagu on 12 December 1782: "I have Mr Wodhull's translation; it will do me credit; he mentions me twice in his preface, once with slight civility, once ( absit invidia dicto ) with impertinence; twice in his notes he honours me with indirect censure; for which reason, and perhaps with some pride on my part, I have taken no notice of him; he deserves no compliment from me, and I am not of a disposition to say any thing uncivil (Huntington Lib. MO 4164). 22 In the same letter he could report the completion of his own version: the last Mss sheets of Euripides are sent to Mr Dodsley, the greatest part is through the press, and I expect that the volume will be published by the Queen's birth-day, at which it may be presumed that every body of fashion will be in town. In this volume I have said nothing of my self or of my work; the book must speak for itself: if it is well written, it wants no apology: if ill, it deserves none. Some professed critics have been sagacious enough to discover marks of hurry and weariness of so long a work; but all their sagacity will not lead them to discover what parts were written first, what last; you will judge whether my attention has abated, by comparing the Hecuba, which was the first Greek Drama I ever attempted to translate, with the Electra which was the last. (Huntington Lib. MO 4164) 23 Potter now considered that his career as a translator of Greek dramatists was at an end. He turned his attention rather to lyric poetry, where he hoped to combine his earlier experience with Pindar with an essay on contemporary poetry: my next attempt will be a most beautiful Ode of Pindar, merely for the sake of a preface inquiring into the nature of the sublime lyric compositions of Antient Greece, and pointing out the unrival'd excellence of Mr Gray among the moderns; it will be no difficult task to show that Dr Johnson has no portion nor sense of that aetherial flame, which animates true genius to make daring incursions into unexplored regions of invention, and boldly to strike into the pathless sublime. (Huntington Lib. MO 4164) By the time the work appeared in May 1783 however, it had fundamentally changed in nature, perhaps due in part to the influence of Mrs Montagu, to a direct attack on Johnson's Lives of the Poets . 24 With two completed translations of Greek dramatists under his belt, Potter's chief concern was in securing his future. He was now in his sixties and relatively famous and had many influential acquaintances. Yet in spite of the earnings from his two works (which never lived up to his expectations), he was still a relatively poor man whose income was largely tied to his "servile employment" as a school master. As he explained to his patroness in a letter of 1 July 1783, "I only wish for such an income as would enable me to make some little provision for my family: as a father it is my duty to endeavour this" (Huntington Lib. MO 4165). Potter's correspondence over the next four years refers to a succession of abortive attempts to persuade his friends to use their influence in securing him some form of preferment. He might solicit the help of Mrs Montagu or Bishop Hurd, only to find his chances of promotion blocked elsewhere. A letter to Mrs Montagu of 22 March 1784 is typical of several from this period: You know perhaps that Mr Frederick Montagu has been earnest to serve me; he induced Lord John Cavendish to support my interest, they together recommended me to the Duke of Portland for a Crown Living, and my name was entered, in the Great Book as a scholar forsooth, a man of genius, and the defender of Mr Gray; the two Gentlemen abovementioned signed their names to this recommendation. Soon after this measure, which does me so much honour, was taken, a revolution happened in public affairs, and my friends no longer had the power to serve me, nor does it appear that they are likely to recover it. I should not have thought this disappointment any hardship had I been taken up in a political view; but my politics carry me very little further than to wish my country well, to fear God, and honour the King. I never had any ambitious views, my expectations were not very sanguine, nor is my disposition apt to despond; I know who disposes of all events. (Huntington Lib. MO 4166) 25 On occasions he became despondent about his plight, particularly when writing to his nephew: "I made an excursion to London; my business was partly to put my great and promising friends to the proof, whether they were in earnest in their professions; I am fully convinced of their insincerity" (N.L.W. Ms 12433, Wigfair 33D letter 21). Most letters to Jerningham show rather a bitter sense of humour, such as on 8 February 1787: . . . I beg, and request, and entreat you never to mention a Lord to me more, and especially not a Lord Spiritual; they are animals of another species, and have nothing of the communis sensus about them; talk to me of persons that feel the glow of humanity warm at their hearts. Of Lord Carlisle I know nothing, but that his Excellency did me the honour to subscribe to Euripides; but he is among an hundred other Lords who have not done me the justice to take the second volume. But I have learnt to speak of this neglect a little distrustingly, as Dodsley's carelessness has led me into some scrapes. Farewell to Lords. Let me turn my enquiries towards Mrs Montagu: I have not been honoured with any notice from her since July last. Is she made Bishop? (Huntington Lib. JE 698 and Bettany, Edward Jerningham , 356-357) In any event he lost much of the will and impetus to push his claims forward following the death of his wife in July 1786. In spite of his disappointments and tribulations, Potter's publishing activities did not cease with his attack on Johnson in 1783. In 1785 he published The Oracle concerning Babylon. And the Song of Exultation from Isaiah, Chap. XIII and XIV , "to revive my dormant name" (letter to Jerningham 17 April 1785 [Huntington Lib. JE 693 and Bettany, Edward Jerningham , 350]). This work had been offered to Dodsley to publish, but he refused Potter's terms (Huntington Lib. MO 4153). This small publication was nothing compared to his work with the Greek dramatists, and it was not long before suggestions were being made that he should complete the trio of tragedies by undertaking a new translation of Sophocles. As he explained in a letter to Elizabeth Montagu of 17 March 1786, I had not finished Euripides, when I was requested to give Sophocles also; this was so often repeated that at length I looked over the Oedipus Tyrannus with such a view; but Sophocles has so much of that beauty which characterizes Virgil and Pope, that happy choice and arrangement and condensation of words, that I thought it impossible to preserve his graces, and shrunk back from the task. About a year ago I was called upon in a very singular manner to undertake this work, with such liberal offers of assistance in the publication, that I could not refuse the attempt; I have done so much, that I flatter myself with the hopes of being able to do the whole well, better than Aeschylus is done, though for obvious reasons it will not be so well received. But to what purpose is it to present the public with works of manly and Attic composition, when nothing will go down but the nauseous morsels with which his many-headed Worship is daily gorged? (Huntington Lib. MO 4171) The approach had come in the Spring of 1785, from Dr Charles Poyntz of North Creake in Norfolk, on behalf of Georgiana Dowager Countess Spencer, whom Potter had met when collaborating with Hans Stanley. Countess Spencer suggester that she might provide Potter with the necessary reference works to complete the translation and underwrite the publication costs. Potter considered the proposition for several months before agreeing. In December 1785 Poyntz supplied Potter with a copy of Thomas Johnson's edition of the collected plays of Sophocles in Greek and Latin ( Sophoclis tragoedia , 3v [London: 1746]). In his letter of thanks, Potter committed himself to the new project: to show you that I am seriously in earnest, I have the honour of acquainting you that I have translated the Oedipus Tyrannus, and have sent it with the original and with Dr Franklin's translation, which is in high repute, though in truth it is ill done, it is unfaithfull, always spiritless: if my friend encourages me, I shall proceed with redoubled alacrity. Sophocles, you well know, is the most correct of all writers and has a thousand peculiar graces in his style and manner: what a task then have you set me? and if I succeed, how very few are capable of firming a just judgement? yet for the sake of those few, if I do the whole, it shall be well done, it shall not be unworthy of the perusal of Lady Spencer. (British Library, temporary reference, Althorp Ms. E28) In April 1786 Edward Jerningham chided his elderly friend for taking over another such large project when he had received so little benefit from the two previous translations. Potter replied in mock anger: I want to rap your knuckles for your jibes and your jeers. You were one of the first to encourage me to give the public a translation of Sophocles; I will do it for all your vloutings; what care I for Franklin's ghost? 26 . . . I wish however the public may think with you, that my mind retains its whole vigour in the advance of life; (though by the by, what occasion have you to wipe the advance of life over my nose?) it was not thought so in my Euripides, because it had not the fire &amp; fury of Aeschylus; nor has Sophocles: can I help that? I will do it well. (Huntington Lib. JE 696; Bettany, Edward Jerningham , 353) The translation of Sophocles was completed by the end of March 1787, but required revision and transcription, although Potter was not then in good health; "a disorder in my stomach has lately brought me within a near expectation of the long black box" (Huntington Lib. JE 699; Bettany, Edward Jerningham , 357). He had now to find a publisher for the work, for his relations with Dodsley had apparently become strained. This was perhaps the result of the large number of subscribers who had not taken the second volume of Euripides, blamed by Potter on the bookseller's mismanagement. In any event, Potter was still seeking some of his receipts from sales of Euripides from Dodsley as late as 1787. He therefore determined to find another bookseller. Potter's good friend John Fenn was then dealing with the London wholesale booksellers George and John Robinson, who were publishing his edition of the Paston Letters . 27 It was presumably as a result of his recommendation that Potter made an approach. Because by 1 October 1787 agreement had still not been reached, Potter wrote to Jerningham to find another bookseller: I have not been able to elicit any answer from Mr Robinson, and am determined to wait no longer for his fastidious insolence; I therefore request the favour of you to recommend me to Mr [James] Robson [a wholesale bookseller in New Bond Street], this moment by letter. I do not wish you to commit yourself, only put us together. It would be most eligible to me to sell the copy right through all possible editions; but I shall ask what he perhaps will think a great deal of money; if he cannot agree to my terms, I will without any hesitation publish at my own expence, and shall be glad to engage him as my Bookseller. (Huntington Lib. JE 701; Bettany, Edward Jerningham , 359-360). By mid November Potter reported to his nephew that Sophocles "is finished, and gone to the Devil (of the Press)". On this occasion he was a little more realistic over the likely profits however. "I am not yet certain that I shall get a shilling by it; but I am sure of not being a loser by it; . . . it is very probable that I have laboured very assiduously two years and six months for nothing but a little fame, which I value at just as much as in these days of taxation it is worth" (N.L.W. Ms. 12433, Wigfair 33D letter 26). In spite of his earlier letter, Potter did eventually use George Robinson as the publisher, although not under his preferred terms. Presumably Dodsley's losses on the Euripides made Robinson wary of purchasing the copyright. As Potter explained to Charles Poyntz, A tedious negotiation with Mr Robinson is at length concluded, but in a manner not altogether agreeable to my wishes. I hoped to have sold the copy, that I might not be troublesome to Lady Spencer or you and with that view proposed what I think advantageous terms to him, he has made me no offer, and only says "I decline purchasing the Copy Right". He has sent me a sheet &amp; half as a specimen, which I approve, and an estimate of the expence, both which I enclose to you, but should be glad to have the specimen returned. You will see that there is a considerable advantage in printing 750 copies, but I fear that 500 will be more than I shall be able to sell. I now most thankfully accept your kind offer of supplying me with money for this occasion, and beg to be informed how and where Mr Robinson may draw for it as it will be wanted; I can only assure you that I will not touch a single guinea arising from the sale till you are reimbursed. I wished to have your answer as soon as may be, that the press may go on, the whole copy is in Mr Robinson's hands. . . . Estimate of Sophocles 72 Sheets printing at 18s/ a sheet 64 16 72 Reams of Paper, 1£ a Ream 72 Putting 500 Copies in boards 18 15 Advertisements and the incidental expenses, suppose at 10 0 ------ Expence of 500 Copies 165 11 250 more, about 58 0 750 copies 223 11 Agreeable to the specimen of paper &amp; print now sent Further details of the publication were finalised the following month, when Potter also sought the advice of Dr Poyntz over the wording of his preface. In this age of anecdote and sing-song I dare not hazard more than 500 copies of such a work as the translation of Sophocles, and I must set every engine at work to secure the sale of these; much depends on fashion, and I hope that the Duchess of Devonshire will be prevailed upon to interest her self in its favour. Should this impression have a quick sale, I may probably sell the copy right for future editions to some advantage; but nothing of this must even be hinted to Mr Robinson. I shall write to him immediately; I think the proper time of publishing will be soon after Easter. I shall be under a necessity of speaking in any preface of Dr Franklin; it will be a delicate and a difficult point. I cannot praise, it is not in my disposition to censure. I know not for whom he translated, nor to whom his translation can be pleasing. (B.L. Althorp E28) In the event, Potter's only reference to Franklin in his preface was that he had wished to leave him "in the undisturbed possession of his well-acquired reputation". During December 1787 final details of the wording of the preface and dedication were agreed, and by the end of February the translator was able to report to his nephew that the work was all but complete: Sophocles is nearly through the Press, it has been lately advertised and will be soon published. I have now translated into English more than forty four thousand three hundred Greek verses, by which I have gained some reputation, a very few guineas, many promises and as many disappointments: but it has been an amusement to me under some severe affilictions. I have not other work in view. (N.L.W. Ms. 12433, Wigfair 33D letter 28) In a letter to Edward Jerningham of 22 February, Potter claimed that "the new edition of Dr Franklin's translation hastens the publication", and five weeks later he was announcing that "Sophocles comes flying all abroad on Monday next. . . . My great object, and great interest is to sell this impression, that I may dispose of the copy right to some advantage; therefore he serves me best, who assists me most in expediting the sale" (Huntington Lib. JE 702/3; Bettany, Edward Jerningham , 361). Potter's The tragedies of Sophocles translated (1788) was reasonably well received, although subject to the usual criticism of paucity of notes. 28 Three months after publication he was reporting to Jerningham that "Sophocles sells very slowly" (Huntington Lib. JE 704; Bettany, Edward Jerningham , 363) and ultimately the work was not as successful as he hoped. It did not manage to supplant Francklin's version, although some commentators considered it to be the superior. Thus the edition did not sell out quickly and provide its author with a profit, although the translation was recognised by contemporaries as being one of some merit, and at least as good as his Euripides. But according to the poet Coleridge, "Pope's popular translation [of Homer] was in the hand, nay, in the mouth of every person; while the translations of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides [by Francklin, Potter and Wodhull] were found only in the libraries of those who did not want them, making scarcely any impression on the community at large" (Thomas Raysor, Coleridge's Shakesperian Criticism , 2v. (1930), II.83). Whilst it is true that many of Potter's subscribers were people of literary fashion rather than learning, all three of the translations were reprinted several times during the nineteenth century and were held in fairly high esteem for fifty years until eventually replaced by more modern editions. 29 The elderly translator therefore retired to Scarning in the Spring of 1788 without having made his fortune but nevertheless having made a major contribution to Greek Studies in eighteenth-century England. But Potter's story does not end with the disappointing sales of Sophocles. Within a month of publication he received a terse letter from Lord Chancellor Thurlow, to whom he had sent copies of his works. Sir Your merit with the literary world intitles you to the attention of the Publick; and consequently of those who possess the opportunity of shewing any degree of respect to such merit. This circumstance draws upon you the trouble of the present letter. The present vacancy of a prebend of Norwich, which is not far out of your neighbourhood seems to afford such an opportunity which may possibly be agreeable to you; if so, I should place some pride, as well as pleasure in disposing of it so properly. (N.R.O. Ms. 21511) Potter continued the story in a joyful letter to his nephew written 17 May 1788. This carried me to Cambridge, as the Degree of A.M. was necessary on this occasion; I was received at Emanuel with every mark of civility and kindness, and by the University with the highest honour it can bestow, the offer of a Dr's Degree, which I declined, at least for the present. From Cambridge I went forward to London, and brought the Great Seal home with me on Saturday last. This week I have been at Norwich, and have been installed. (N.L.W. Ms. 12433, Wigfair 33D) Lord Chancellor Thurlow, with whom the sixty-seven year old Potter had been at School, later claimed "he did not like to promote him earlier for fear of making him indolent" (John Campbell, Lives of the Lord Chancellors and keepers of the Great Seal of England , 5th ed. (London, 1868), VII.295). Thurlow's subsequent ungracious behaviour to Potter, when he attempted to thank him in person for the promotion, is described in William Beloe's The sexagenarian (2v. [London, 1817], I.299-300). The value of the promotion was £300 per year, double his existing income; furthermore, it did not involve the family leaving Scarning since attendance at the Cathedral was required for only two months each year. However, if this were not good fortune enough, the local ecclesiastical establishment at last began to recognize the scholar whom they had so long neglected. In June 1789 Bishop Lewis Bagot, without being asked, awarded to Potter the united livings of the Vicarage of Lowestoft and Rectory of Kessingland, which were valued at £470 and therefore among the richest benefices within the diocese. Thus the family had a new home and an income well beyond their expectations. Potter retained his Prebend's stall but resigned from his other livings, and in 1790 he moved from Scarning to Lowestoft. His remaining literary works were a discussion of his ideas of literary criticism in the form of a further more detailed pamphlet attack on Johnson ( The Art of criticism; as exemplified in Dr. Johnson's lives of the most eminent English poets [London, 1789]) and two commemoration sermons. Potter is usually portrayed as having been a likeable, unaffected and simple-mannered man with an undoubted sense of humour. There was, however, some aspect of his character which could irritate great men such as Johnson or Thurlow. But the old man was obviously appreciated by his new parishioners, who later subscribed to a mural monument for him in Lowestoft churchyard: Near to this place are interred the remains of the Rev. Robert Potter, A.M., a prebendary of Norwich, and also vicar of Lowestoft and Kessingland, with which preferment his highly deserved literary fame as 'the learned and elegant translator of Aeschylus' and other Greek dramatic poets, was nobly rewarded. Endeared to the inhabitants of this parish by his open, manly, and generous attachment to their general welfare, and earnest zeal for their spiritual improvement, let this stone, placed at their expense, attest how warmly they cherish the remembrance of their late pastor, who died 9th August 1804. in the eighty-fourth year of his age. 30</field>

Publication had been delayed until February 1779 to allow Potter first to dispose of the quarto edition. However, there were still copies of the quarto edition advertised for sale in the first volume of Euripides, which was published nearly three years later. 12 William Doughty (d. 1782), the portrait painter and mezzotint engraver. Romney's portrait of Potter eventually arrived in Scarning in August 1779. According to Romney's son and biographer, "Dr Potter's translation of Aeschylus was read by Mr Romney immediately after its publication, and he was so forcibly impressed by the boldness and sublimity of the subjects selected by that early dramatist, and by the simple, but vigorous manner in which they were treated, that he called him the painter's poet, and ranked him next to Shakespeare as a powerful delineator of the stronger passions" (John Romney, Memoirs of the life and works of George Romney [London, 1830], 161). Romney also planned to illustrate a scene from Alcestis, and Potter therefore sent him a transcript (ibid., 150). Potter's keen interest in art is also evident from the prologue to The Supplicant , where he describes "the persons of the drama forming a picture, that would have well employed the united pencils of Poussin and Claude Loraine" ( Aeschylus , 68). 13 Johnson's mockery of Potter's attempts at blank verse is also mentioned in a letter of 1 August 1779 from Susan Burney to Fanny Burney ( The early diary of Frances Burney , 2v. (London, 1889), II. 256-258). 14 Stanley approached Potter through a mutual acquaintance, the Honourable Charles Townsend (N.L.W. Ms. 12481C, Wigfair 81). This manuscript also contains Potter's notes and drafts of his correspondence relating to this matter. 15 Quotation from Gray's Progress of Poesy . 16 See Horace Walpole's Correspondence , ed. W. S. Lewis (1955), XXVIII. This happened whilst Stanley was staying with his friend Lord Spencer of Althorp. Potter did however later manage to use part of his work in An inquiry into some passages in Dr. Johnson's Lives of the poets: particularly his observations on lyric poetry, and the odes of Gray (London, 1783), which included 'The ninth Pythian ode of Pindar translated' (pp. 39-50). 17 Richard Robinson, Lord Rokeby and Archbishop of Armagh, who subscribed for six copies. He was a distant relation of Mrs Montagu. 18 She may also have given Potter the expensive engraving of the Head of Euripides, which adorns the title page (Huntington Lib. MO 4163). 19 The reviewer is here quoting from Potter's introduction (I. 27, footnote). Potter explained his principles when translating poetry in an undated draft of a letter to Hans Stanley (NLW 12481C fol. 15): "It appears to me that a translator should not only endeavour to preserve the sense &amp; spirit of his author, but even the form of the original composition, as far as the rhythms of a different language will permit." 20 Other reviews of the Euripides were less damning or else reserved judgment until the appearance of the second volume (e.g. Westminster Magazine , February 1782, 26). That appearing in the Monthly Review (LXVII [1782], 242) however complained of "several expressions too familiar and prosaic for the tragic Muse, and which by no means were necessary to give a faithful representation of the original". See also Penelope Wilson, 'Classical poetry and the eighteenth-century reader', 80. 21 Richard Jodrell, Illustrations of Euripides, on the ion and the Bacchae (London, 1781). A second volume on The Alcestis was published in 1789. Jodrell used Potter's (unpublished) translation in various illustrations from the text, acknowledged only by the translator's name given in brackets. He did not however mention the forthcoming edition among the list of modern poetical translations (p. 610). Potter and Wodhull together received fleeting praise in the second volume (p. 365). 22 Wodhull's translation is usually considered to be inferior to that of Potter (Clarke, Greek Studies in England 1700-1830 , 151); the Critical Review pronounced, "The translation is accurate and just, the poetry, in general, inharmonious, and the dialogue flat and prosaic". However, coming after Potter, this work was not submitted to the same contemporary criticism. 23 Potter also reported to Edward Jerningham that the work was printed and would immediately be published on 3 March 1783 (Huntington Lib. JE 4165, and Bettany, Edward Jerningham , 339. 24 Robert Potter, An inquiry into some passages in Dr. Johnson's Lives of the poets: particularly his observations on lyric poetry, and the odes of Gray (London, 1783).

      <field name="heading_text">Rickaby Cancellation: A New Species of Post-Impression Correction by B. N. Gerrard *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is commonly accepted that the purpose of cancellation in printed works is to change the text in some way, perhaps to soften a possibly libellous view, or to correct, belatedly, an error in setting. The essence of cancellation is that it alters the text as originally set. The intention of this paper is to report a new form of cancellation which has nothing to do with the text but rather with the quality of the engraved, illustrative matter. The London printer Thomas Rickaby practised this specialised form of cancellation at the end of the eighteenth century, and for this reason I term it 'Rickaby cancellation'. I define Rickaby cancellation as the cancellation of a leaf (or more) because the quality of an illustration , whether of itself or through bad press work, was below some arbitrary standard. In 1793 Rickaby printed an edition of Virgil with variant readings and notes by the German editor Christian Gottlieb Heine. 1 The works and annotations were published as four quarto volumes. Since these would have been very thick, part title-pages were supplied to allow the Virgil to appear in eight volumes, and it is normally found in this way. The set is generally admired, for it has many charming engraved vignettes, in the cameo style characteristic of the 1790's. 2 An examination of the Virgil reveals a number of cancellantia, but these appear, at first, to be randomly distributed between copies, which is most improbable if textual changes have been made. The Virgil is printed on a good quality, heavy, wove paper watermarked 'J Whatman' once only on a shorter edge of each sheet. However, this mark occurs in two distinct places which are best explained by referring to the quarto leaves, rather than the original sheet. In those sheets, which we may describe as having watermark 1, the name, which must be read vertically, appears close to the foot of the outer edge of a leaf. With watermark 2 the name is in the middle of the outer edge of the leaf. With the exception of the preliminary leaves in vol. 1, these two types of paper are the only ones used in the Virgil , and there is never any overlap in the positions of the watermarks. 3 There is never a situation when an examiner is in doubt whether the example is of watermark 1 or 2. As there was only a single mark in the original sheet, so there is only one mark in each gathering of the finished book, and it will occur randomly in any one of the four leaves. Traditionally the detection of cancellantia has been through the presence of stubs of cancellanda. But in the second half of the eighteenth century bookbinders became increasingly clever at disguising these stubs. This skill seems to have been practised especially upon more valuable books, and ordinary reading of the Virgil reveals no stubs at all, at least in the copies examined for the purposes of this paper. The only way in which cancellation can be detected in the Rickaby Virgil is by disruption of the watermark sequence; we must examine the individual leaves against a direct light. Here we encounter a problem. Only one in four of the leaves of each gathering in its original state has a watermark. If we consider a single-leaf cancellation there is only a 1:4 chance that the leaf with the watermark will be removed. Similarly there is only a 1:4 chance that this leaf will be replaced by another having the watermark, if the same paper stock is used. There is, therefore, a 1:16 chance that a watermarked leaf which is cancelled will be replaced by another watermarked leaf. On the other hand, the chances of an unmarked leaf being cancelled are 3:4, and the replacement leaf is also likely to be unmarked 3:4 times. So that there is a 9:16 probability that an unmarked leaf, that has to be cancelled, will be replaced by another unmarked leaf. If the job of binding in cancellantia is done 'without trace' then 10:16 will not betray themselves by a disruption of the watermark sequence. Looked at the other way round we will find cancellantia through a disrupted sequence of watermarks in only 6:16 (or 37.5%) of all the instances where there are, in fact, cancellantia. Could this low level of cancellantia revealing themselves through a disruption to the pattern of watermarks account for the apparently random distribution of cancellantia in copies of the edition? In part this could be the answer, but only in part. Certainly, without resorting to dissection of the book it would not be possible to identify absolutely the cancellantia in a particular copy. One of the copies examined for this paper was uncut and so enabled some extra gatherings, with normal watermark patterns, to be defined as having cancellantia, for lengths of leaves did not always coincide in what should have been conjugate pairs. 4 In replicate examinations of the Virgil a number of cancellantia were noticed. It was also observed that: i. Cancellantia appeared to occur only in gatherings which had an engraved illustration. ii. Where checking was possible—that is because an extra watermark was now present in the gathering—the watermarks were always both type 1, or both type 2. Examination of replicate copies did not seem to show the repetition of cancellation within the same gatherings that would be expected with an ordinary textural cancellation; but the apparent absence of consistent cancellantia might have been a function of detecting only 37.5% of the possible cancellantia. Nevertheless, where there was an obvious cancellans, it conformed to the two observations already given. One example was even found of three watermarks being observable in a single gathering, and all were of the type 1 kind. 5 Examination of more and more copies revealed that almost always the cancellantia were associated with gatherings in which there was also an engraving present. Furthermore, where an extra watermark was found in the gathering one of those watermarks occurs on a leaf with an engraving. For example, let us suppose that an engraving appears on the third leaf of a particular gathering. All we can say of the original gathering is that one of the four leaves will have the characteristic 'J Whatman' watermark in the type 1 or type 2 place. If there has been cancellation three results are possible in the case of trimmed copies of the Virgil with no visible stubs of cancellanda: 1. The gathering has a watermark in leaves 1, or 2, or 4, and, if there has been cancellation of an engraving on leaf 3, the event has not occurred with the addition of an extra watermark. Such a cancellation is at present undetectable. 2. The gathering has now no watermark. The absence of a watermark indicates that as the cancellandum had a watermark (one was present in the original sheet, and so in the original gathering) the gathering is a cancellans. The absence of a watermark from the gathering provides evidence of cancellation, but does not enable us to state which leaf is a cancellans: it might be any one of the four leaves in the gathering, as no leaf differs from any other. 3. The gathering contains two watermarks, which indicates cancellation. However, we now have some added evidence. Originally the gathering must have had a single watermark, and a cancellandum leaf without a mark has been replaced by a cancellans with a watermark. It therefore follows that the cancellans must be one of the two leaves with a watermark. It is found that one of the two watermarks always occurs in the third leaf of our hypothetical gathering, that is, the leaf with the engraved illustration. Where there are two watermarks in the gathering, both are found to be either type 1 or type 2; there is no occasion on which two watermarks are found in a gathering one of one type, and one of another. Replicate examination of the Virgil links the cancellation phenomena almost exclusively with engravings and permits no other explanation. Why was such cancellation carried out? Rickaby's problems possibly lay with the fact that the plates used for the engravings were not new; they had been used previously for an edition of the Virgil printed by Caspar Fritsch in Leipzig during 1788 and 1789. 6 It a plate became too worn or damaged, it might have been discarded. Because this could happen at different stages in the lives of individual plates, it is, moreover, conceivable that some books contain, or want, more illustrations than others. A second problem may have been that some illustrations were spoilt by bad press-work. Even in the book as issued, the vignettes occasionally cover some of the text, 7 and cancellantia, presumably containing the better state of a leaf, have the engraving misaligned with the text. Sheets with more than one engraving would have compounded the chances for error. To solve the problems he encountered, Rickaby seems to have cut up sheets with good engravings to provide cancellantia to replace the poor impressions in other sheets. With the recording by the ESTC of eighteenth-century printings still incomplete, it is difficult to know how many copies of the quarto Virgil still exist. At present some fifteen copies are known to ESTC and I have personally examined eleven of them. Bearing in mind that the same two papers have been used throughout the volumes, and allowing for the fact that, if the survey is large enough, we are able to detect only 37.5% of all cancellantia, then the results for each volume can be shown in tabular form (see Table 1).

Three comments are called for when consulting the Table: 1. Generally it is possible to state only that a particular gathering has a cancellans within it. This means that the ± signs used in the table represent a cancellation, within that gathering . The ± sign should not be taken to indicate absolute certainty that the cancellans is synonymous with the leaf bearing the engravings. Nevertheless, for easy reference the actual locations of all the engravings (throughout the volumes) are given. Thus there is a cancellans present in gathering k in vol. 1 in the copy now at Yale, and in all copies there is an engraving at k1 v . In all volumes there are instances where more than one engraving occurs in a gathering—in vol. 1, at D, M, 2P and 3C. In these gatherings it is not always possible to determine which leaf is a cancellans. These signs, like all other ± signs, indicate only that there is a cancellation within the gathering. 2. The amount of cancellation varies widely between copies. For example, in vol. 1 the BN copy has only one detectable cancellans, and the VMoU copy only two. On the other hand the BL(2) copy has six detectable cancellantia. Nevertheless, it is possible that these wide variations are a consequence of the 62.5% undetectable cancellantia. 3. In setting out Table 1 only the cancellantia are given which can be linked with cancelled engravings. There are others and, since these appear not to be Rickaby cancellantia, they must be analysed in detail. In vol. 1 the relevant gatherings, and the associated copies, are i (BL[1]); 1 (MH-H); O (BL[1]; BL[2]; Dm; CtY); X (VU[2]; BL[2]; Dm; MH-H; CtY); 2O (BL[2]; BN; MH-H). The opening gathering i 4 may have an ordinary or a Rickaby cancellans; it is simply not possible to tell. Signature l in the Houghton copy has type 1 watermarks at l1 and l2. This is presumed to be an ordinary cancellation of matters textual, since there is no illustration within the gathering, and no place where an illustration might have been added. It may well occur in other copies and be undetected for the reasons already stated. Signature O contains a cancellans in four copies. In the BL(2) copy there are watermarks at O2 and O3, one of which must be a cancellans. In all copies seen O3 r has a large white space at its foot, and it is highly likely that there was once an engraving there, that it was not up to Rickaby's standards, and therefore that it was removed. It will be explained that at some stage in the book-production, some engravings, which were expected in the edition, were no longer included in the Virgil , and this is probably one of the lacunae. There is a chance that the leaf with the engraving will be found, in an as yet unexamined copy. Signature X has a cancellans in five copies. X2 and X3 have watermarks in BL(2), X2 and X4 in Dm, X1 and X2 in CtY. X2 is the only common leaf here, and X2 v has again considerable white space. Again this is presumably a Rickaby cancellation, and perhaps a cancellandum will be discovered. Only signature 2O remains to be accounted for. In both the BN and MH-H copies, type 1 watermarks occur at 2O1 and 2O3. In all copies 2O3 v has a large area of white space, and again this appears to be a lacuna where an engraving existed but was cancelled. The Rickaby cancellation is indirectly suggested by the apparent shortage of engravings in the final copies, but absolute proof depends, once more, upon the discovery of a cancellandum leaf with an engraving. If we regard the existence of cancellation in vol. 2 in the same way as vol. 1, we are left with three anomalous cancellantia: b (BL[1]; BL[2]; CSmH); 2K (BL[2]; CSmH); 4G (CtY). All three anomalous copies of gathering b lack watermarks. Nevertheless, there is a large white area at the foot of b2 v , and this suggests Rickaby cancellation. In gathering 2K again both anomalous examples have no watermarks in the gathering and a white space suggestive of Rickaby cancellation is at the foot of 2K1 v . There are at least four more copies of the quarto Virgil which I have not examined. If Rickaby cancellation is sound as a principle, then two watermarks may be found in some of the second volumes, at b and 2K. Further, where two watermarks are found in these gatherings, one of them is likely to be at b2 and one at 2K1 to allow for leaves which held engravings, but which were cancelled. There is also a possibility that the cancellanda will be found. In gathering 4G the CtY copy has type 2 watermarks in 4G3 and 4G4. One of these leaves must therefore be a cancellans. However, this is not a Rickaby cancellation, as the cancelled passage is in the middle of the Fifth Book of the Æneid . The cancellations and their sites in vol. 3 in the same eleven copies are shown, except that the second part of the volume was not examined in the Göttingen copy, and here the anomalous cancellantia are at: M (CtY); 4F (VU[1]; BN). The CtY copy has type 2 watermarks at M2 and M4. One of these leaves has to have been cancelled for textual reasons. Gathering 4F in the VU (1) copy has no watermarks. But the BN copy has two type 1 watermarks, one at 4F3, the other at 4F4. It appears that the extra watermark at 4F3 could indicate a Rickaby cancellation as 4F3 v has the lower half of the page blank. There remains only vol. 4 to be considered. The volume now at Göttingen was not examined so that only ten copies were analysed. There are two anomalous cancellantia: 2A (BL[2]); 4A (MH-H). Gathering 2A is split into two parts: the first two leaves conclude the first part of vol. 4, the second two leaves begin the second part. However, in the BL(2) copy there are no watermarks in the gathering and this may represent either a cancellation or simply that the two half-gatherings did not come from the same sheet. Gathering 4A must contain a textual cancellation as it is in the middle of the index. In the MH-H copy there are no watermarks in the gathering, so that from this single anomalous copy it is not possible to suggest which leaf is a cancellans. There are, then, only four examples of cancellation, in the copies which I examined, which appear to be textual: Vol. 1 MH-H copy has type 1 watermarks at l1 and l2. Vol. 2 CtY copy has type 2 watermarks at 4G3 and 4G4. Vol. 3 CtY copy has type 2 watermarks at M2 and M4. Vol. 4 MH-H copy has no watermark in gathering 4A. At present nothing can be gleaned from gathering 4A in the Houghton copy, other than to state the obvious: that one or more leaves have been cancelled with the removal of the original watermark. This leaves only three other copies with apparently 'ordinary' cancellantia, and each example is unique. More copies, with cancellantia in the same gatherings, need to be examined before any conclusions can be drawn from these isolated examples. It appears strange that in the three cases of two watermarks within the gathering, identical paper has been used on each occasion, for, if a textual cancellans was required, printing must have been after the regular letterpress run, and would not necessarily have employed the paper which was used in the first instance. We might speculate that in only three cases the presence of identical paper is pure chance; it may also be significant that in each of these three cases the paper type could be identical because the watermark belongs to a pair of conjugate leaves: perhaps there has not been cancellation of a textual sort, but Rickaby bifoliar cancellation, perhaps because the letter press was poorly registered. Such speculation remains just that, without further evidence. When all the watermarks were recorded, they reflected the statistics, in that many gatherings in which there is a cancellans (37.5% of all cancellations) had no watermark. There is a 1:4 chance that the leaf with the watermark has been removed and a 3:4 chance that it has been replaced by an unmarked leaf, that is 3:16 or 18.75%. In other words the analysis reveals only 37.5% of cancellantia, and half of these have no marks, whilst half have an extra watermark, in the gathering. If the results of this rather limited analysis are tabulated they prove what is not visible to the bibliographer's prepared eye: which leaves—with an engraving—must contain the intrusive second watermarks in each gathering. Set out in Table 2 are the results of this analysis showing those gatherings with an engraving and in which two leaves with watermarks were noted. The leaf with the engraving is underlined. The results show a relationship between an intrusive watermark and a leaf with either an engraving or a white area (where it is suggested that there was once an engraving). There are two anomalies in the table, both in vol. 1 of the Harvard copy. In gathering U, U1 has an engraving, but watermarks were found in leaves U2 and U4; in gathering 2A though there is an engraving at 2A3, watermarks are present in leaves 2A2 and 2A4. This suggests a bifoliar cancellation, or if it is a single leaf, a textual and not a Rickaby cancellation. It will have been observed that records are given for only three of the four volumes. This is because only one copy shows any gathering with intrusive watermarks in vol. 4. This is the Harvard copy and in gathering n watermarks are present in n2, n3 and n4. Both n3 and n4 have engravings, which means that originally there was a watermark only at n2 within the gathering, but single-leaf cancellations at n3 and n4 have fortuitously brought two more watermarks in. It is now possible to summarise cancellations in the Virgil : there are 69 engravings present in 54 gatherings, at least 38 of which have cancellantia within them, though once again it must be stressed that many cancellantia will go undetected. In addition to these confirmed Rickaby cancellantia there are twelve cancellantia with no engravings. It seems reasonable to suppose that six of these are Rickaby cancellantia, where the printer, it is presumed, disposed of an engraving which was unsatisfactory. Thus we have perhaps only six cancellations of the normal textual sort and evidence that cancellation was practised to improve the appearance of engravings. It is then my considered opinion that there appear once to have been 75 engravings adorning the Virgil , six more than are present in each of the copies examined for this paper. Confirmation of the originally greater number of vignettes is in fact given in the Critical Review 10 (1794): 303-304 where amongst the encomiums on the Virgil we read 'the plates (in number no less than seventy-five)'. Here surely is the strongest indication of Rickaby cancellation. Do any copies extant contain 75 engravings? Did any copy ever have that many? Did the reviewer base his remarks on advice from the booksellers or the printer? It is a very laborious process to count the engravings for whilst three may be found in close proximity, the next one may be found many, many pages on. It appears that the reviewer in the Critical Review relied on advice from an 'informed' source, or a very early source, possibly even a Proposals leaflet. Wherever this information came from, doubtless the reviewer passed it on in good faith, and in so doing confirmed the existence of six engravings which have not been seen, and Rickaby cancellation. This 'improvement' of vignettes—rather than text—is the explanation for the observations noted. It means as a corollary that a careful description of the cancellantia within the work in the usual manner is pointless. There is little value in stating A-C 4 (±C3) D-F 4 (±F2) etc. when in another copy it may be A-B 4 (±B2) C-D 4 (±D1) E-G 4 etc., even if we are fortunate enough to know that in these copies these leaves are definitely cancellantia. Such a formula is glib, as it stands, suggesting that the bibliographer is certain that particular leaves, and only these particular leaves, are cancellantia. The nature of Rickaby cancellation in the Virgil is such that some leaves which are cancelled will remain undetectable. This has important ramifications, for the phenomenon of Rickaby cancellation bedevils classical bibliographical description, though the possibility of multiple ideal copies had been suggested by Tanselle in SB 33 (1980): 18-53 (and perhaps especially p. 47). Now two quite different copies—as far as cancellantia are concerned—may be ideal, for these were the states which the printer released to the public. Since not all cancellantia can be identified in the Virgil with our present techniques, no certain description of any particular copy is possible. However, even with the statistical limitations of undetected cancellantia and the problems associated with wove paper, we may be able to offer a description which will, at least, alert the bibliographer to the need for care when examining an edition in which there are Rickaby cancellantia. If the bibliographer describes a quarto copy as A-C 4 (±C1) D-E 4 (±E2) . . ., then it is anticipated that there are possibly two loci for cancellantia, at C1 and E2, and absence of the cancellantia suggests the presence of cancellanda. With Rickaby cancellantia the loci are not fixed throughout the edition, and not only do we expect to find variability between copies, but even what is known is still likely to leave about 60% of cancellantia undetected in the Virgil . I propose that in view of these factors the bibliographer should describe copies in a manner which will point up the differences between Rickaby cancellation and ordinary cancellation, and where the formula for two copies might be: A: A-C 4 (±C1 R ) D-E 4 (±E2 R ) . . . B: A-B 4 (±B3 R ) C-D 4 (±D4 R ) . . . Here the copy is inextricably linked with the formula, and the bibliographer realises that copy A—possibly uniquely—has Rickaby cancellantia at C1 and E2 because the capital letter R is used as an index. Again the nexus is clearly shown in the second formula where copy B has Rickaby cancellantia at B3 and D4. In the case of the Virgil we might write, for example, of parts of vol. 2: GOT . . . 3I-3K 4 (±3K1 R ) 3L-3X 4 MH-H . . . 3I 4 (±3I4 R ) 3K 4 (±3K1 R ) 3L-3X 4 . . . CtY . . . 3I-3X 4 (±3X2 R ) . . . CSmH . . . 3I-3X 4 (±3X2 R ) . . . —always providing that we could be certain which leaf was the cancellans in each copy. There is now an absolute nexus between copy and the Rickaby cancellantia within that copy. Of course, it may be that further examination of copies reveals information about the status of a copy that was previously examined, but the distinctive formula alerts the bibliographer to conditions governing the cancellations. Part of the importance of this novel style of describing the Rickaby cancellation status of particular copies may lie in future findings. If we consider the formulae advanced for the sections of vol. 2 described above, we see that the Yale and Huntington copies appear the same: CtY . . . 3I-3X 4 (±3X2 R ) . . . CSmH . . . 3I-3X 4 (±3X2 R ) . . . However, bibliographical techniques may be developed which enable investigators to demonstrate cancellations at a number of other sites, cancellations which will clearly distinguish the Yale and Huntington copies. Some, but not all, copies of the Virgil have gathering 2 Yy 4 at the close of vol. 4 detailing addenda and corrigenda. To a potential buyer of the works of Virgil this substantial list might have been somewhat discouraging, though it might not have bothered the buyer of the illustrated works of Virgil. There are only fifteen copies of the Virgil known at present, and even with the completion of ESTC this number is unlikely to be doubled. It would have been interesting to ascertain whether Rickaby had intended to print more quarto copies than this, but so far it has not proved possible to trace any of his records. A great deal of paper had been wasted, as well as a great deal of ink and printers' time. What were needed now were positive reviews to ensure successful sales of the Virgil . Rickaby himself printed the British Critic and it is tempting to think that he influenced the favorable reviewer of the Virgil in that work. 8 However, from a new price of £21 in boards the price of the Virgil tumbled. In Lowndes's Bibliographer's Manual , prices are quoted for the quarto ranging from the 16 guineas for lot 341 in the Steevens Sale in 1800 for a copy bound in russia, to £5-12-6d for lot 830 in Part 3 of the Sale of Sir Mark Masterman Sykes in 1824. 9 Before leaving the Rickaby Virgil mention should be made of one other curious feature. The tail-piece on 3X2 r of vol. 2 remains something of a puzzle. The engraving there has been clumsily sandwiched between the text and the direction line, with the plate mark overlapping two lines of text. Has any reader seen a possibly different state where the tail-piece is set beneath the text and the re-positioned direction line? This is where the engraving might be expected. If applicable, this phenomenon is probably present elsewhere and suggests the initial examination of other illustrated works printed by Rickaby. Thomas Rickaby printed more than 60 works in the eighteenth century alone, but few are illustrated. I have examined all the other relevant illustrated works of Rickaby's from that century, but only one bears the characteristic stigma of Rickaby cancellation. This is the Hudibras edited by Treadway Russell Nash and printed in the same year as the Virgil , 1793. 10 The Hudibras is in a limited edition variously described as of one or two hundred copies. 11 Again the format is quarto and whilst there are a few plates in the early part of vol. 1i, the interest lies in the engraved vignettes which are placed as headand tail-pieces to the cantos. At the time of the analysis 25 copies of the Hudibras had been catalogued by the ESTC, and I examined eighteen of these. The same two papers used in the Virgil are used for the Hudibras , and the results are set out in Table 3. Table 3 shows the position of the engravings and cancellantia within vol. 1i-ii, and again the obvious question is, how many more cancellations are there in this volume? There is only one anomalous gathering with a cancellation: 4M, which has no vignette. There is cancellation within this gathering in six copies: Gerrard, CSmH, VU, GOT, MH-H and PPL. Again, like so many of the apparently anomalous cancellations in the Virgil , this is probably a site of Rickaby cancellation. 4M2 r has the conclusion of Part III Canto III, and holds only eight lines of text—less than half the page is occupied. Once there was probably a vignette to conclude this piece. There are no other cancellantia in vol. 1, and this suggests that all the cancellantia in this volume are Rickaby cancellantia. There remains vol. 2, that part of the whole book with a title page reading 'Notes, on Hudibras.', which were written by Nash. 12 Here, originally, there was printed a final gathering 3T 4 in the volume. However, it appears that originally 3T 4 had 3T1 the close of the index, and 3T2 an errata list. 3T3 was then a blank leaf, which if it is still found in the volume is usually at the close of vol. 2. 3T4 was the title-page to the second part of vol. 2. Sometimes the blank is bound in immediately before the inserted title page, but the Copies Gerrard Author's own copy. BL(1) British Library: 77.1.9-11. Owo Worcester College, Oxford: N.11.6-8.

The original gathering 3T 4 —the four leaves wherever they are placed in vol. 2—occasionally have two watermarks within them, notably, in this study, in the copies at Ck and GOT. Presumably this Rickaby cancellation represents dissatisfaction with the 'Bevereye' engraving on the title page to vol. 2ii. In the Hudibras there are eighteen gatherings with engravings, and cancellantia can be identified in fourteen of these gatherings—and one other where there probably once was an engraving. There are no other cancellantia. It does not seem that there is a possibility of anything other than Rickaby cancellation. As with the Virgil , so originally with the Hudibras , not all the leaves with intrusive watermarks betraying Rickaby cancellations were recorded. However, the watermarks were recorded in ten copies, which had, in total, 35 gatherings with extra watermarks. One difference from the Virgil was immediately apparent: in every case the cancellation is bifoliar. This is confirmed by leaf lengths in the two uncut copies examined. For example in the Eastnor copy there are two gatherings with two watermarks: 2D and 2L. 2D1 and 2D2 have watermarks, but here the engraving is found on 2D4. Similarly 2L1 and 2L2 have watermarks but the engraving is on 2L4. In these gatherings Rickaby cancellation has caused a leaf containing a watermark to be introduced conjugate with the leaf bearing the engraving. Now it might be that the leaf conjugate with the engraving had to be cancelled, but this can be dismissed, by analogy with the Virgil , on two counts: the certainty of bifoliar cancellation in the uncut copies, already mentioned, and the regularity of cancellantia being associated with gatherings containing engravings. Nash proceeded from the King's School, Worcester, in 1740 to Worcester College, Oxford, as a Cookes Scholar. Later he took orders and became an official of Worcester College before inheriting substantial estates, which caused him to resign his college positions at the end of 1758, move to Bevere and marry. It is possible that two of the copies have a direct link with Nash: those now at Worcester College, Oxford and Eastnor Castle. 13 Nash fathered only one daughter, and in 1785 this daughter, Margaret, married John Somers Cocks, eldest son of Baron Somers. Margaret Cocks became Lady Somers on the death of her father-in-law in 1806, and lived at Eastnor. It might be expected that a Nash-connected copy of Hudibras would be in the fine library now at Eastnor Castle. There is a red-inked copy at Eastnor, but though it has the bookplate of Margaret's husband, it does not have the armorial plate of Nash which is found in very many of the Eastnor books. Once more there is no definite link between the Eastnor copy and Nash himself. 14 In the copies with red-inked engravings which were examined, the Gerrard, BL(1) and CSmH copies have all engravings in red ink—though, as noted, each of these copies possesses some Rickaby cancellations. However, the other four copies with engravings in red ink did not reach such a stage of perfection. In the copy now at Owo the engravings on B2 r in vol. 1i, and on the title page of vol. 2i are both in black ink. The Eastnor copy has vignettes in black in vol. 1 at e4 r , B2 r and 4R3 v . In the other copies of the red-inked issue seen, those at E and CLU-C(1), the engraving at B2 r in vol. 1i is again in black ink. None of these gatherings, admittedly only seven in all, appears to possess a Rickaby cancellans, though this may reflect statistical probabilities. In the Eastnor copy, the Bevereye illustration on the title page of vol. 2 is badly mis-aligned, with the plate being skewed across the volume number beneath it. 15 It has not yet been possible for me to examine other works with illustrations, except where they impinge on other work in progress. For this reason I can cite only one other case that I consider possibly a Rickaby cancellation. This is the bifoliar cancellation of 7Q1.4 in a copy of AI∧IANOΓ IIEPI ZΩΩN IΔIOTHTOΣ (London: 1744). It appears, on analogy with the Virgil and Hudibras , that the cancellation in one of the copies at the British Library (54.g.9) was effected because the engraved illustration in the final leaf of the book was defective. This is the only copy of this edition that I know of with this leaf (or conjugate pair of leaves) cancelled, and there appears to be no textual difference from other copies. Since there is no known archival material of Rickaby's substandard illustrations, it is possible only to conjecture what his standards may have been. All that can be said is that, in the two editions treated here, Rickaby's 'quality control standards' of 1793 found some illustrations to be unacceptable for publication. Rickaby cancellation applies to an illustration, rather than the text upon a leaf, for otherwise there is no distinction from any other cancellation. It is important to note that Rickaby cancellation is a term that I have coined purely from the source of the discovery; there is reason to suppose that Rickaby cancellations occur in other illustrated editions, not printed by, or associated in any way with, Thomas Rickaby. Furthermore, though this article describes the use of stock paper—that is, the same paper that is used throughout the edition—for Rickaby cancellations, there is no reason why this should be so for Rickaby cancellations of other editions. Indeed if an intrusive paper had been used for the cancellations described in this article, the determination of the specific cancellans leaf would have been much easier, just as the cancellantia are easily detected in Baskerville's 1757 Virgil . It is likely that Rickaby cancellations, in editions which have yet to be discovered, use previously printed sheets (or leaves) with, or without, engraved material; cancellation of the engraved material may be with a 'better' engraving than was originally present—whatever that may mean—or with a sheet, or part of a sheet, which had not been through the rolling press, but only the letter press.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * I acknowledge with gratitude my University Department's grant of the Cécile Parrish Scholarship for 1989, which contributed towards my travelling expenses in Europe and the United States of America. 1 P. Virgilii Maronis opera , edited by Chr. Gottl. Heyne, 3rd ed., 4 vols. in 8. (London: 1793). At the same time Rickaby printed other issues of the work in octavo in 1793, but these do not have the engravings. For reasons that will become obvious with the reading of this paper, it is not possible to give an accurate formulaic description for the Virgil . Basically the collation is: 1i: i 4 a-ii 4 A-Z 4 Aa 4 (-Aa4). 1ii: 2 1 1 Aa4 Bb-Zz 4 3A-4B 4 (-4B4). 2i: i 1 a-m 4 A-Z 4 Aa-Qq 4 Rr 4 (-Rr2-4). 2ii: 2 i 1 Rr 4 (-Rr1) Ss-Zz 4 3A-5K 4 . 3i: i 1 A-Z 4 Aa-Zz 4 3A 4 ; 2M and 2N are signed 'M' and 'N'. 3ii: 2 i 1 3B-4Y 4 4Z 2 4Z2 is blank. 4i: i 1 a-z 4 aa-ii 4 2 r 2 A-Z 4 Aa 4 (-Aa3,4); 2e Signed 'e'. 4ii: 2 i 1 Aa 4 (-Aa1,2) Bb-Zz 4 3A-4S 4 2 Yy 4 . There are other lacunae and mistakes in the signatures such as 3B2 being unsigned, and 3R2 being signed '2R2' in vol. 3 of BL (1), but these are of little significance in this article. The reader should also be cautioned that occasionally leaves are found much misplaced from where they might be expected. To give just one example, the final leaf of vol. 1i, Aa4, is sometimes found in vol. 1ii following leaf Cc3. 2 The cost of the work in printer's boards was £21. This figure is mentioned at the time in reviews such as the Critical Review 10 (1794): 301. It is also confirmed by a contemporary pencilled note on the front flyleaf of vol. 1 in the copy at Archbishop Marsh's Library, Dublin, which reads: Published 21. 0. 0 Binding 12.12. --- 33.12. 0 At the close of the eighteenth century this sum would have been equivalent to six months' wages for a journeyman. 3 If gathering 2B, in a particular section of the edition, is the last gathering on watermark 2 paper, and 2C is the beginning of a run of watermark 1 paper, this is so in all eleven copies seen of the Virgil . This certainty is also true of the Hudibras v. infra. It may well be that each type of paper comprises a pair of watermarks, though any differences between moulds were not demonstrable. 4 Uncut copy in the Baillieu Library, University of Melbourne, VU:RBR:25D, Poynton Collection. 5 Three type 1 watermarks were found in signature M in vol. 1 of the Baillieu Library copy, VU:RBR:25D: Poynton Collection. A cancellans is by definition a post-impression correction. If it is a feature produced after printing then it might be printed on type 1 or 2 paper, or if those had run out, on a quite different paper. For an example we need only consider the first book to ultilise wove paper, the Virgil of 1757, printed by John Baskerville. Although he was a printer most concerned with appearance, the cancellantia in this edition are on a quite different paper. They stand out in the sequence of unmarked wove leaves because they are on unmarked laid paper, though stubs are generally not noticeable. The point is that it is unlikely that a printer would go to the trouble of printing cancellantia on exactly the same paper previously used for a particular gathering. There would be no reason to do so. It might even be questioned whether Rickaby was aware of any difference in the papers, for both were wove, of the same quality, and with the same watermark. If, on the other hand, sheets all printed at one time from one stock were used to cancel one another, all the watermarks would indeed match. 6 P. Virgilii Maroni opera , edited by Chr. Gottl. Heyne, 'editio altera', 4 vols. (Leipzig: 1788-89). Here I wish to acknowledge the great help given to me in preliminary investigations by Marie-Luise Spieckermann of the English Department, the University of Münster, Federal Republic of Germany. 7 There is an engraving which actually intrudes on the text of the title page in vol. 3 of the copy at Monash University. 8 In the British Critic 2 (1793): 416 the reviewer writes, 'Splendid publications, like the present, have seldom been carried on in other countries of Europe, but under the immediate patronage of sovereign princes, or eminent and affluent men, who, from their own bounty and munificence, have undertaken to indemnify the individual from that peril which might eventually attend his want of success with the public. It is not therefore a little honourable to this country, and the state of the arts among us, that the booksellers of the metropolis, relying with confidence on the public taste, have, without calling for any collateral aids, prosecuted to its accomplishment a work of extraordinary splendor, and consequently of serious expence'. Referring to the Rickaby Virgil there is a footnote in the Critical Review 10 (1794): 302 which states that 'On this undertaking, if we are not misinformed, the proprietors have expended 4000l.' 9 William Thomas Lowndes, Bibliographer's Manual , revised and enlarged edition by Henry G. Bohn, 6 vols. (London: 1890). 10 Samuel Butler, Hudibras , with notes by Treadway Russell Nash (London: 1793). This edition of Hudibras is (always?) found bound in three vols. Volumes '1' and '2', the poem itself, are described on the title pages as the first and second parts of vol. 1, and the register is continuous. The third volume contains Dr Nash's very extensive commentary and notes, and this again is one continuous register broken into two parts by an inserted second-part title page. These two parts of the commentary are, in my experience, never divided, most probably because they form a volume of more or less the same thickness as the first two volumes. 11 By very kind permission of James and Sarah Hervey-Bathurst of Eastnor Castle, Herefordshire, I was allowed access to what may have been Nash's own copy of Hudibras . Further, Mr and Mrs Hervey-Bathurst extended to me the invaluable services of their archivist Lis Hissink, who guided me through the Nash papers held in the Castle's muniments room. Though Dr Nash frequently mentions contacts with Rickaby, he nowhere refers to how many copies of Hudibras were printed. Nash even mentions problems with the engravings for the work, but little more. Lowndes, Bibliographer's Manual , indicates: '200 copies printed, some with the plates in red, others in black'. However many were printed, most were in black ink and only a few in red. This latter form is now what may charitably be described as sepia in tone, rather than red . The distinction between sepia and red may be merely a point of late twentieth-century taste, or it may be that the red pigment has oxidised over the centuries. The ESTC states that 100 copies were printed, and does not give a source for this assertion. It may be presumed to originate in a possibly early nineteenth-century comment written by Grenville, or his librarian, or bookseller, and now bound with the flyleaves into vol. 1i of the Grenville copy at the British Library, BL(2). The note states that there were '100 copies printed of this rare and valuable edition'. 12 Nash was a very testy fellow by all accounts, and his treatment of the Hudibras is somewhat idiosyncratic. The title page reading 'Notes, on Hudibras' implies a stand-alone character belied by the volume number. Similarly Nash's name does not occur within the book as the writer of these notes. His engraved portrait is a frontispiece to vol. 2, but, though Nash's arms are shown on the plate, there is no legend as to whom we are seeing. The original of this portrait is at Eastnor Castle. This frontispiece parallels that of Samuel Butler (who is identified) in vol. 1. In that volume the engraved title pages have a vignette of 'Butler's tenement at Strensham, Worcestershire' showing a half-timbered cottage viewed from the opposite bank of the Avon. On the letterpress title pages in vol. 2—for there are no engraved ones in this volume—are large vignettes showing a pastoral scene with a Georgian house. Across the top of the plate is inscribed 'Bevereye'. In fact, this is a view of Bevere (pron. Beverē) Manor, Nash's house, three miles north-west of Worcester. Nowhere is there any explanation of Nash's portrait, or his house. 13 It would be nice to know if Nash presented Worcester with one of the special copies printed with red-inked engravings. But unfortunately the archives of the College for the period in question are incomplete, and no Nash connection can be identified. For this advice I am indebted to Lesley Le Claire, the College Librarian. 14 The Somers family, at least throughout the nineteenth century, kept its libraries intact. But the family did move books between their country homes, Reigate Priory and Eastnor Castle, and their London home. Reigate Priory was sold and some books went in an associated sale of chattels. Unfortunately, from the insufficient catalogue details of the sale, it is not possible to state whether a copy of Hudibras associated with Nash was sold at that time. 15 Correctly the plate should, of course, be parallel with the volume number. In most copies this is so, and the foot of the plate mark is about 6mm above the volume number.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">From The Bookman of London by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first number of The Bookman (October 1891), the periodical of that name published in London, bore, as would all subsequent numbers, the running head "I am a Bookman. James Russell Lowell ." It was founded by W. R. Nicoll, for many years its editor, and is not to be confused with The Bookman, a Review of Books and Life . . . published in New York by Dodd, Mead and Company. The London Bookman appeared without any editorial manifesto but with a prefatory list of contributors, the first number listing, among others, J. M. Barrie, A. C. Benson, Oscar Browning, Thomas Hardy, Nicoll himself, Walter Pater, A. T. Quiller-Couch ("Q"), and Lord Selborne. Contributors to later volumes included W. B. Yeats, G. K. Chesterton, Alfred Noyes, Walter de la Mare, T. J. Wise, Katherine Tynan and a growing number of academics. Some notice has been taken in author bibliographies of the writings of these and other contributors, although many, especially reviews and letters, have been neglected. A random check of a number of the articles in The Bookman reveals that the compilers of the CBEL and of the NCBEL have, for the most part, overlooked much that should have been noted, including some letters. The editor of The Bookman asked a number of "representative authors, artists, and men and women eminent in English public life" to favour him with a note of (1) Any personal recollection they had of or connected with Dickens; (2) whether their life or work owed anything to his influence; (3) their personal opinion of the value of his novels; whether they considered his humour appealed as strongly to readers of our time as of his own, and which they would rank as the greatest of his books. (41:247) Among those responding and whose replies were printed in the February 1912 number were Thomas Hardy and G. K. Chesterton. I quote them in order of appearance. In reply to your inquiries I regret to say that I have no information to give that can be of much service to you. I did not know Dickens, though when a young man in London I heard him read from his books in the Hanover Square Rooms. But as I was thinking more of verse than of prose at that time, I do not know that my literary efforts owed much to his influence. No doubt they owed something unconsciously, since everybody's did in those days. Your other questions I cannot answer. (41:247) G. K. Chesterton's reply was described as "brief but emphatic." (1) Personal recollection . . . — Nothing . (2) Whether life or work owes anything to influence . . . — Everything . (3) Personal opinion of value of his novels—His novels have long been independent of anybody's personal opinion. I consider that his humour appeals more to readers of the present day. I think his greatest book is "Pickwick." 1 (41:255) Hall Caine's autobiographical My Story (1968) has a chapter on his friendship with John Ruskin and one on his friendship with Wilkie Collins. He quotes no letters from Ruskin to him but he does quote passages from letters of Collins to him. The first letter from Collins, from which Caine quotes the last four paragraphs (20:319-320), is undated, but the entire letter, dated March 15, 1888, is printed in full in volume twenty (August 1901) as part of a long article on Caine by J. E. Hodder Williams (20:138-146). This letter from London is of primary interest for its light on Collins as a critic of the novel. He had received a copy of Hall Caine's The Deemster and thus had led him to compare it to Caine's The Shadow of a Crime . He wrote, You have written a remarkable work of fiction—a great advance on "The Shadow of a Crime" (to my mind)—a powerful and pathetic story, the characters vividly conceived, and set in action with a master hand. Within the limits of a letter, I cannot quote a tenth part of the passages which have seized on my interest and admiration. As one example, among many others which I should like to quote, let me mention the chapter that describes the fishermen taking the dead body out to sea in the hope of concealing the murder. The motives assigned to the men and the manner in which they express themselves show a knowledge of human nature which places you among the masters of our craft, and a superiority to temptations to conventional treatment that no words of mine can praise too highly. He then looked forward to Caine's next book and had this advice for him. When you next take up your pen, will you consider a little whether your tendency to dwell on what is grotesque and violent in human character does not require some discipline? Look again at the "Deemster," and at some of the qualities and modes of thought attributed to "Dan." Again, your power as a writer sometimes misleads you, as I think, into forgetting the value of contrast. The grand picture which your story presents of terror and grief wants relief. Individually and collectively, there is variety in the human lot. We are no more continuously neglected than we are continuously happy. Next time, I want more of the humour which leaks out so delightfully in old "Quilleash." More breaks of sunshine in your splendid cloudy sky will be a truer picture of nature, and will certainly enlarge the number of your admiring readers. He closed by assuring Caine that he had not yet written his best book. Caine quotes fragments from what would appear to be two more letters from Collins, the first being an invitation for Caine to visit him: "If you don't object to a room without a carpet or a curtain, I can declare myself still possessed of a table and two chairs, pen and ink, and brandy and water, and I should be delighted to see you" (20:320-321). The second fragment is actually the second paragraph of the March 15, 1888, letter (20:334-335). The letter from Ruskin (20:140-141) is known; there is no edition of Collins's letters. The October 1892 number prints two more letters from Wilkie Collins in a piece titled "An Interview with Mr. A. P. Watt" (3:20). Watt was a prominent literary agent the walls of whose office "on the first floor of 2 Paternoster Square" were covered with photographs of his clients. Among these was one of "the late Wilkie Collins, and beside it the following note— a codicil which was found after his death attached to his will": I desire that my friend and literary representative, Mr. W. P. Watt, of 2, Paternoster Square, may act as my Literary Executor, and that his advice may be accepted as representing my literary interests and wishes in regard to the copyrights of my books which may remain to be sold after my death by my other executors. WILKIE COLLINS. Watt commented, Wilkie and I were the best of friends since the time I first met him, about 1880, until the day of his death. As his health began to fail he felt less and less able to do all the work for which he had commissions, and I had some rather delicate negotiations with some of his publishers to keep things going smoothly. He was always so profuse in his thanks, however, that it was a real pleasure to do him a service of any kind. I remember a very amusing letter I had from him about the time of the Sackville incident in the U.S.A. The answering letter concludes the part about Collins in the interview. 83, Wimpole Street, W. 13th Nov. , 1888. MY DEAR WATT,—My best thanks for your letter and the enclosures. You have achieved a masterly success with our proprietors. If I could spare you as a friend (which I cannot possibly do), I should recommend the Government to send you to the United States as diplomatic representative in the place of Lord Sackville.—Ever yours. WILKIE COLLINS. Kenneth Robinson, in Wilkie Collins. A Biography (1952), acknowledges that "The Executors of the late Alexander Pollock Watt, who was the first literary agent and Wilkie Collins' literary executor have given me permission to publish Collins' letters in this biography; and the present partners in the firm of A. P. Watt &amp; Son have allowed me to read a number of his other letters" (p. [9]). Although Robinson refers to the preservation of Collins's letters to Watt and mentions Collins's appointing Watt as his literary executor, he does not quote the codicil or the letter (pp. 299-300). The first volume of The Bookman (Dec. 1891) contained an article titled "The State Recognition of Authors" (pp. 97-98), the first two sentences of which read, "In the recent controversy between Mr. Besant and the Spectator as to the desirability of titles and distinctions being conferred by the State on eminent men of letters, the voices of those most directly interested in the matter, with the exception of Mr. Besant, have not been kind. For this reason we asked a few distinguished literary and scientific men to express their opinions on the subject." There were replies from F. Max Müller, John Tyndall, Selborne, Walter Lecky, and Thomas Hardy. Hardy wrote, Sir,—I dare say it would be very interesting that literature should be honoured by the State. But I don't see how it could be satisfactorily done. The highest flights of the pen are often, indeed mostly, the excursions and revelations of souls unreconciled to life; while the natural tendency of a government would be to encourage acquiescence in life as it is. However, I have not thought much about the matter. (p. 98) Only F. Max Müller thought the suggestion a good one, since honors and distinctions were accorded literary men in Germany. Hardy figured prominently in the second volume, as Nicoll, the editor, reported on a recent conversation someone had had with Hardy. He was asked "why he gave 'Tess' so sad an ending." "For the simple reason," he replied, "that I could not help myself. I hate the optimistic grin which ends a story happily, merely to suit conventional ideas. It raises a far greater horror in me than the honest sadness that comes after tragedy. Many people wrote to me begging to end it well. One old gentleman of eighty implored me to reconcile Tess and Angel. But I could not. They would never have lived happily. Angel was far too fastidious and particular. He would inevitably have thrown her fall in her face. But indeed I had little or nothing to do with it. When I got to the middle of the story, the characters took their fates into their own hands, and I literally had no power." ------------------ "Besides," went on Mr. Hardy, "don't you see by her violent death poor Tess makes some reparation for her sins, and so justice is satisfied. I can assure you many of my feminine readers feel that very strongly." ------------------ "Don't some people find fault with you for calling Tess a pure woman?" "Well, perhaps they do. I consider that she was to all intents and purposes a pure woman till her last fall. Then she was as a mere corpse drifting in the water to her end—an absolutely irresponsible being. No," went on Mr. Hardy in reply to a remark, "I hate word -painting. I never try to do it; all I endeavour is to give an impression of a scene as it strikes me. For instance, Stonehenge I describe exactly as I saw it on that sad day, when I decided Tess must die—can I ever forget the misery of that day? There was the lowering sky, and the wind booming past the great temple of the Druids; I always go to a place first before attempting to describe it. I went purposely to Winchester that I might know what to say when I described Angel Clare and her sister climbing up the hill to see the black flag run up that was to announce the doom of Tess." ------------------ "Are many of your characters from life, Mr. Hardy?" "Oh yes, almost all of them. I knew those three dairy maids as a boy well. The old clergyman was a much-loved vicar in this very neighborhood. Bathsheba Everdene in 'Far from the Madding Crowd' was my own aunt. Now and again real people with their own names walk into my pages. Do you remember Admiral Hardy in 'The Trumpet Major'? Well, there he is;" and Mr. Hardy pointed to the portrait of a handsome old naval officer that hung upon the wall; "that is Sir Thomas Hardy in whose arms Nelson died; he was a relation of mine. Then 'Shepherd Oak' I knew well when I was a boy." "And you find these simple country people interesting to write about?" "Why, certainly I do. They have far more sentiment and romance than the class above them, which has a struggle ever going on within its ranks for petty social superiority. If you live among these people you will find after a time that variety takes the place of monotony. The people begin to differentiate themselves as in a chemical process. They become beings of many minds, infinite in difference; some happy, many serene, a few depressed, one here and there bright even to genius; some stupid, others wanton, others austere; some mutely Miltonic, some potentially Cromwellian. The men strong heroic souls; the girls dainty heroines. Remember, as I have said, they, or many of them, are the representatives of a magnificent antiquity." (p. 6) Here, better than any second-hand or more remote account, are Hardy's ipsissima verba , as reported by Nicoll. A "Symposium on the Republication of Newspaper Articles" designed to elicit replies "on the desirability of seeking a more permanent audience for journalistic work" prompted a reply from Andrew Lang, surely one of the most prolific journalists of his time. Dear Sir, —I do not think I can enter into the subject of my own performances. But some things are written with the purpose of publishing them in book shape, yet are first used in a serial, just as a novel runs through a magazine. The serial form is a mere accident. I doubt whether essays written as journalistic work pure and simple are often worth reprinting. The distinction between the two sorts is obvious and essential, and specimens of both kinds may be found in the final collection, for example, of Thackeray's writings.—Faithfully yours, A. Lang. (12:65) Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, not yet knighted, to be sure, contributed a number of pieces over the years. He contributed an appreciation of J. M. Barrie to the first volume of the Bookman (1:169, 171) and reviewed Barrie's novel The Little White Bird ten years later (23:49-51). One of the pieces in the first number of volume two (April 1892) was "A Talk With Mr. Quiller-Couch—'Q'" (14-15; quoted below). When the Scots scholar-critic, biographer, and editor of Sir Walter Scott's poetry Walter Minto died, "Q" was one of those asked to contribute an obituary notice to the Bookman (4:13). In addition he wrote a number of other reviews: Vol. 21, E. A. Bennet, Fame and Fiction . . . (21-22); Letters of John Richard Green , ed. Leslie Stephen (85-86); Augustine Birrell, Miscellanies (95); Patrick Walker, Six Saints of the Covenant . . . (138-139); Irving Bacheller, D'ri and I . . . (140-141); G. K. Chesterton, The Defendant (168-169). Vol. 22, The Victorian Anthology , ed. M. E. Grant Duff (19-20); Margaretta Byrde, The Searchers (99-100); William Watson, Coronation Ode . . . (130-137); Charles G. Harper, The Holy Road . . . (207-208). Vol. 23, Austin Dobson, Side-Walk Studies (60-61); fourteen novels (94-96); Sidney Lee, Queen Victoria (152-153). Vol. 24, Emile Zola, Truth (20-22); Elsworth Lawson, From the Unvarying Star (66); Joseph Conrad, Typhoon and Other Stories (108-109). I have insisted, so far privately, on the importance of reviews, and take this as one opportunity to explain my reasons, if, indeed, reasons be needed. While some bibliographers and fewer biographers list all or some of the reviews of their authors, most do not (the Soho bibliographies for the most part being exceptions). F. Brittain, for example, lists some of Q's reviews in his biography but overlooks those written for The Bookman —among others. 2 One reads the essay on J. M. Barrie in volume one and the review of The Little White Bird in volume twenty-three with keener appreciation of Q's words when one knows the relationship between the two men. Barrie was on the staff of The Speaker when Q was assistant editor; Q dedicated his novel Ia to him; Barrie spent much of his honeymoon in Fowey and "spent many happy hours at The Haven" (Q's home in Fowey); the two contemplated collaborating on a play; and, to summarize, although more could be mentioned, in 1903 Barrie wrote, "I think it is the truth to say that in these 40 years I have met no man who has meant as much to me," and in 1909, "On the whole I've cared for you more than any other of our calling" (Brittain, pp. 19, 31, 33, 42, and 45). Although there was some constraint in their later relationship, Q could write to a friend on Barrie's death, "For all that, our affection held, unstrained, to the end. A few months before his death he dined with us at Queen Anne's Mansions and talked away till past midnight—loth to go then, as he told us, rather wistfully" (Brittain, p. 141). But Q could be objective about the weaknesses in Barrie's work in the early essay, though in the review, ten years later, he outdid himself in praise of The Little White Bird . The review of Zola's Truth ( Verité ) is important in that in it Q expresses some of his most dearly-held beliefs. As prelude, however, I should point out that Q had reviewed Zola's Lá Debâcle in The Speaker for September 23, 1892 (reprinted in Adventures in Criticism [1925], pp. 107-111). There he had written that the novel stifled him as did Zola's later books (p. 108). Q was Church of England and a Liberal, an active one, Brittain writing of his "life-long fidelity to Liberalism" (p. 51). One of Q's Cambridge lectures, "Tradition and Orthodoxy," published in 1934 as one of the essays in The Poet as Citizen and Other Papers , was in reply to T. S. Eliot's who had used the phrase, "a society like ours, worm-eaten with Liberalism." Q wrote that what Eliot meant by Liberalism was "anything which questions dogma: which dogma, to be right dogma, is the priestly utterance of a particular branch of a historically fissiparous Church" (quoted in Brittain, pp. 141-142). Thus, when one goes back to the Zola review in The Bookman , thirty-one years before the publication of the volume in which the lecture was printed, one sees, retrospectively, how very strongly Q felt. Indeed, I believe the relevant part of the Zola review is the strongest statement, couched in the strongest language, Q ever made on the subject. The review, as with others of his reviews, is material for biographers, and, of course, for bibliographers. Q's mention of his lifting "a humble voice at the time of the Rennes trial" of Alfred Dreyfus would not be known from Brittain's biography, and the locus of his remarks remains to be discovered. E. A. Bennet's Fame and Fiction. An Enquiry into Certain Popularities (1901), reviewed by Q, had a chapter on "Mr. J. M. Barrie" in which Bennet wrote, among other statements, that "when we return to the best parts of 'A Window in Thrums,' we are apt to remark that we care not whether Mr. Barrie is a literary artist or not, he is an undefined. Something that we enjoy." Q, who had quoted this statement, wrote that Bennet's "shrewdness" had deserted him in the chapter on Barrie, adding that "the business of the critic is to define these undefined somethings, and to expound the pleasure which he has had the capacity to feel" (21:21). Given what I have already written above about Q and Barrie, one can understand Q's reservations about Bennet's chapter on Barrie. One of Q's associates on The Speaker , the periodical of which he was assistant editor, was Augustine Birrell, whom he disliked. "'That man takes himself much too seriously and nothing else seriously enough' he once wrote to Wemyss Reid; but at another time he described Birrell as 'representing Fife [for which he was MP] as it ought to be represented—by wind'" (Brittain, p. 19). Despite his dislike of the man, Q praised the volume of essays, Miscellanies , in his review of it, writing of the "enjoyment" afforded by "this wise and witty volume" (21:95). William Watson was another of Q's associates on The Speaker , and Q's review of Watson's Coronation ode is laudatory with but one flaw noted, an "untrue" conceit (22:130-131). I do not know how many interviews Q granted, and hence reprint this one from the Bookman , especially as here one gets his off-the-cuff remarks about a number of authors. I omit the first two paragraphs and begin with Q's answer to the question of how he would justify the existence of a critic. "Well," he replied, with a smile, "the only justification for his existence is that criticism is a branch of the art of enjoyment. He tells the people what they are to enjoy. But it is not therefore necessary to blackguard a man. No, I don't think it is possible to 'train' critics; we cannot establish a 'critical' college, or hold 'critical' exams. for professional critics. The question is not Does he find enjoyment in his work? so much as Do other people enjoy it? 'The proof of the pudding is in the eating.' Howells starts with a priori notions about truth being the first necessity for art, and then in this notion he condemns writers. Now, I maintain that you can't stick to the dead level of truth. The artist sees simply or melodramatically according as he has simplicity or melodrama in the back of his eye. Jane Austen is true, and Charles Reade is true, and yet there is no similarity between 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'The Cloister and the Hearth.' There is room for all. The test of an artist's truth is his strength." Blathwayt then asked what the general trend in English fiction was today. "Well," was the reply, "we are beginning to see the truth of realism. There is more representation of life, and less presentation. All this involves an attitude of humility towards nature and the great facts of life. Take Hardy, for instance. See how true he is. In one of his books he tells us he knows what kind of tree it is he is walking under at night, merely by the sound the wind makes rustling through the leaves. There is an indication of humble study of nature. Look at that picture of Alfred Parsons," continued Mr. Couch, for I may mention that at the moment we were seated in Mr. Parsons' studio, "look at that picture of Parsons, and see how true it is to nature. Look at those trees, the sunlight on that upland, the massing of those clouds on the horizon. That is nature. Hardy and Parsons are wonderfully alike in that respect. But still, whilst you must represent , you can't get rid of presentation , as Howells urges must be done. A writer cannot get away from himself. I believe myself in no general statement. Each man brings forth his own work, and the critics must find this out." Do men or women most respond to the spirit of the age? Q said it was decidedly men. Take Meredith, for instance. No man, or woman either, has made us so thoroughly understand women as he has done, and that is the great test of a novelist. Tolstoi's 'War and Peace' is the biggest novel ever written as yet. But Meredith is the greatest amongst the English writers. He is so far ahead in his ideas of women and what they want." And when Blathwayt confessed he couldn't understand Meredith, Q replied "Well," he said, "as a matter of fact, I think only one or two artists can really understand him. These advanced views of his have really retarded him more than the difficulties of his style. Hardy and Meredith understand women better than any one else, though both Henry James and Howells are very careful students of women also." The rest of the interview was largely about Q's own books. Q confessed he attached real value only to Noughts and Crosses , which led him to consideration of the supposed wane of the vogue of the novel. "Look at 'Our Conquerors,' 'The Scapegoat,' 'Tess,' 'The Little Minister.' It is wonderful. And quite as remarkable it is to notice the manner in which we are getting out of the old conventional groove. To transplant a bad French convention and to defy Mudie, as a year or two ago people were inclined to do, is not good art, nor is it realism. But to produce splendid originality and a clean, healthy realism is to promulgate a new gospel. The outlook is very bright." The interview, one of many Blathwayt conducted, evidently made but little impression on him for there is no mention of Q in the chapter "Some people I have met" in his autobiography, Through Life and Round the World, the Story of My Life (1917). The relevance of reviews for a more complete understanding of the reviewer's critical opinions, as well as the possible addition of new or complementary biographical information, can be seen in the reviews Q wrote for the London Bookman . Should one resurrect all the reviews Q wrote for the periodicals, one would have a large body of material upon which to call. Q was a most prolific writer, but those of his reviews which have been forgotten, whatever their number and extent, should be added to his bibliography and studied for whatever light they may throw upon him as man and critic.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Piltdown Man and the Norman Conquest: Working Volumes and Printer's Copy for Charles Dawson's The History of Hastings Castle by Peter Miles</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charles Dawson (1864-1916) played a central but essentially still unresolved role in one of the greatest controversies in the history of science. The Piltdown Man hoax centered on the 'discovery' of what were many years afterwards recognized as a five-hundred-year-old human skull and the doctored jawbone of an orang-utang. Yet before they were discredited, these artifacts found international acceptance as the fossil record of a transitional creature between ape and man, and as a validation of Darwin's account of human evolution. For the period of the hoax's public success, from 1912 to the mid-1950s, science knew this missing link as Eoanthropus dawsoni —Charles Dawson's Dawn Man. The Piltdown hoax continues to be documented and analyzed, Dawson himself being variously construed as the principal hoaxer and as main victim of the hoax. 1 For the learned community of the day, Dawson's credibility in the Piltdown affair was supported by a reputation that extended beyond palaeontology into archaeology, antiquarianism and local history. Indeed, his most substantial publication in any of these fields was his two-volume study The History of Hastings Castle (London: Constable, 1909 [1910]). The preface of Hastings Castle is signed as from Uckfield, the Sussex town (some four or five miles from Piltdown) where Dawson practised as a solicitor in the years after 1890. More than twenty years ago a small cache of books was retrieved from builders' waste during renovation of an Uckfield store-room with a remote association with Dawson. 2 In 1953, at the time of the British Museum's reassessment of the Piltdown material, it had been understood that there were 'no papers of C[harles] D[awson]'s at Uckfield, and that the lofts [of his office premises there] had all been cleared out during the war for salvage'. The latest study of the Piltdown story has reconfirmed this view ( Piltdown Papers , p. 217). The purpose of this article is to modify that understanding (i.e. that Dawson materials did not survive in the Uckfield area); to present, indeed, the evidence for this particular cache having once formed part of Dawson's library; more specifically, to suggest that the books constituted working volumes in Dawson's preparation of Hastings Castle , and in one case provisional printer's copy for part of that study. 3 The evidence of the cache also has some implications for the larger Piltdown debate in terms of the detail that it adds to knowledge of estimates of Dawson's scholarship. 4 In this context, those proposing Dawson as the Piltdown hoaxer have at times called into question the scholarly integrity of Hastings Castle . Referring to the British Museum investigations in the 1950s led by J.S. Weiner, Frank Spencer summarizes this aspect of the debate: Equally disturbing to Weiner was the criticism levelled at Dawson's two-volume work, the History of Hastings Castle . Published in 1910 this imposing work was received with mixed reviews. Some believed it was destined to become the standard work, while others were less than complimentary. There were some, in fact, in particular Louis F. Salzman (1878-1971), a medieval historian and Council Member of the Sussex Archaeological Society, who, Weiner reported, considered the work to be 'less a product of genuine scholarship than of extensive plagiarism'. Salzman's estimate of Dawson's History was later endorsed by J. Mainwaring Baines, who, in 1954, was Curator of the Hastings Museum. In Baines' opinion, well over half of Dawson's text had been 'copied unblushingly' from an old manuscript written by the antiquarian William Herbert who had carried out excavations at Hastings Castle in 1824. ( Piltdown . . . Forgery , pp. 151-152) Like his colleague Langham, Spencer concludes that the charge of 'plagiarism' against Dawson on this particular head was 'quite inaccurate' ( Piltdown . . . Forgery , p. 231, n. 70). However, the evidence of the Uckfield cache in fact highlights at least one minor instance of effective plagiarism elsewhere in Hastings Castle. Moreover, at the same time as it provides a snapshot of some fairly meticulous work on Dawson's part, it also raises questions concerning the depth of his scholarship. The title page of Hastings Castle bears the date 1909. Spencer has pointed out that the English Catalogue of Books lists the study as in fact published in July 1910, and also cites a letter dated 10 July 1910 from Dawson to his principal associate in the Piltdown affair, Smith Woodward, mentioning that 'I have been very busy lately attending to the last details of my book on Hastings Castle etc (2 vols) which is published tomorrow (Monday). I am glad to get it off my hands'. Spencer also observes that 'the reason for the delay in publication is not known' ( Piltdown Papers , p. 10). The evidence of the Uckfield cache additionally suggests where some of the problems in producing a final text, and perhaps some of the consequent delays in publishing the study, may have lain. There was nothing incongruous about Dawson seeing Hastings Castle through the press well into the period when he was supposedly also pondering the first 'finds' at Piltdown (allegedly dating from 1908). The cultural environment that fostered the search for (and eventually the fabrication of) a native British prehistoric skull to rival the discoveries of continental, and especially German scholarship, equally fostered an attention to the Battle of Hastings as one of the 'Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World' (vol. I, p. v) and as a key moment in the ineluctable making of Britain as great power. (Dawson's colleague Smith Woodward was to entitle his account of the Piltdown discoveries The First Englishman ; in discussing the ancient coinage of Hastings, Dawson found space to highlight the 'humiliation to modern ideas' involved in the best specimens of the Hastings mint then being preserved in Copenhagen, a legacy from the payment of Danegelt [vol. I, p. ix].) One must assume that Dawson was glad to get Hastings Castle 'off his hands' only because of the difficulties and delays in its production rather than because of its relative lack of importance to him. On the contrary ('2 vols', he stresses to Smith Woodward), it was the culmination of Dawson's multifarious studies to that date. The Uckfield cache consists of ten nineteenth-century texts in the publishers' bindings, which by the time of their salvage were somewhat battered and damp-stained. Viewed against the background of Dawson's work on Hastings Castle , they can be divided into three hypothetical categories: (a) primary sources; (b) secondary sources; (c) others. (a) Primary Sources The Venerable Bede's Ecclesiastical History of England. Also the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle , ed. by J. A. Giles, Bohn's Antiquarian Library, 5th edn (London: Bell, 1884). The Annals of Roger de Hoveden. Comprising the History of England and of Other Countries of Europe from A.D. 732 to A.D. 1201 , trans. by Henry T. Riley, Bohn's Antiquarian Library, 2 vols (London: Bohn, 1853); I, A.D. 732 to A.D. 1180 ; II, A.D. 1181 to A.D. 1201. The Chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon, Comprising the History of England from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Accession of Henry II. Also the Acts of Stephen . . ., ed. and trans. by Thomas Forester, Bohn's Antiquarian Library (London: Bohn, 1853). Select Historical Documents of the Middle Ages , ed. and trans. by Ernest F. Henderson, Bohn's Antiquarian Library (London: Bell, 1892). Ordericus Vitalis, The ecclesiastical History of england and Normandy , trans. by Thomas Forester, Bohn's Antiquarian Library, 4 vols (London: Bohn, 1853): I. (b) Secondary Sources Augustin Thierry, History of the Conquest of England by the Normans; Its Causes and Consequences, in england, Scotland, Ireland and on the Continent , trans. by William Hazlitt, Bogue's European Library, 2 vols (London: Bogue, 1847): I, II. George Townsend, Russell's History of Modern Europe Epitomised. Being A Complete Text-Book of Modern History . . ., eighth thousand (London: Routledge, 1858). (c) Others The Orations of Marcus Tullius Cicero , trans. by C. D. Yonge, Bell's Classical Library, 4 vols (London: Bell, 1884): III, Orations for his House, Plancius, Sextus, Coelius, Milo, Ligarius, &amp;c. &amp;c. (This classification of the copies is only modified below to suggest that vol. I of Thierry's History of the Conquest is better regarded as having functioned as a primary, rather than as a secondary, source.) The section of Hastings Castle to which most of the cache relates is the distinctive set of twenty-seven separate 'sheets' bound in between pp. 568/569 of the second volume. Each sheet consists of a pair of standard-sized leaves printed on one side only and mounted after the fashion of atlas bifolios in order to allow text to be scanned across a flat-lying verso and recto. Mark Antony Lower, a Sussex antiquarian of a generation preceding Dawson's, commented of the Battle of Hastings that 'it is only by collation of many descriptions . . . that a writer can hope to convey a moderately accurate idea of such a scene'. Dawson effectively followed Lower's hint by using these sheets to allow readers to compare the standard sources' accounts of the battle. The various narratives were edited to produce a parallel-text format involving five printed columns per sheet. The twenty-seven sheets fall into twelve numbered sections, each devoted to a phase of the preparations for battle, the battle itself, and its aftermath. Two sections are made up of only one sheet each (5; 10); six have two sheets (1; 2; 4; 7; 11; 12); three have three sheets (3; 6; 8), and one has four (9). The presence of the third or middle column on each sheet necessitates the special form of mountings, though the factor ultimately determining this presentation may rather have been the decision to include across the head of the first sheet of each section the relevant portion of the Bayeux Tapestry as a visual parallel to the accounts printed beneath. Of the copies in the Uckfield cache, none bear any explicit inscription or annotation identifying their owner as Charles Dawson. Indeed, vol. II of Thierry's History of the Conquest and the singleton volume of Cicero's Orations bear no annotation at all. Russell's History carries on its title page, as the only annotation of the copy, the pencil signature 'G. E. Hart Junr'. As a solicitor in Uckfield, Dawson was senior partner in the firm of Dawson and Hart. 5 While this connects the book to Dawson's partner, no closer link with Dawson himself can be established on the strength of the evidence of this volume alone. Indeed, the claim for the provenance of these three volumes largely rests simply on their collocation with volumes which are much more demonstrably Dawson's. At the same time, they are obviously the three texts with the least bearing, in terms of their content, on the concerns of Hastings Castle : their lack of annotation may then be construed as consistent with a view of the cache as having had a specific function in the preparation of that study. Nevertheless, the case of Russell's History (and even of Cicero's Orations ) could certainly involve nothing more than one or two of Hart's books getting mixed up with some of Dawson's. However, the circumstantial evidence for Dawsonian provenance is rather stronger in the case of vol. II of Thierry's History of the Conquest in the light of the annotation of the associated vol. I discussed below. The evidence is also a little stronger still in the case of the barely annotated copy of Bede's Ecclesiastical History [and] The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle , partly in the light of the evidence of the annotation of Henderson's Documents discussed below, but also because the three extracts from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that Dawson used in his battle sheets do follow the wording of the translation in Giles's edition. Moreover, while many of the pages of the copy in the Uckfield cache remain uncut, the uncut pages do not include those dealing with the years 1065-1070. That section of the copy also includes a marginal mark and an underlining in pencil which isolate, with a significance which becomes more apparent and consistent in the light of the annotation of the other copies, the heart of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle's extremely minimal treatment of the Battle of Hastings itself: '[and Harold came from the north,] and fought against him before all his army had come up' (p. 443). Vol. I of the Annals of Roger de Hoveden displays the kind of annotation associated with informal research: a great number of pencilled marks in the margins, a little underlining and the odd word of comment. These annotations are consistent with a particular interest in Hastings on the part of the annotator: any mention of Hastings or of the Eu family, for example, tends to be marked, though these factors do not by themselves provide strong evidence of provenance. Vol. II of the Annals is very similar in the characteristics of its annotation and in the paucity of their implication. 6 At the same time, the evidence of the copy of Henderson's Documents (see below) has a bearing on the provenance of both volumes of the Annals of Roger de Hoveden . In short, while these six volumes reveal no evidence wholly contradicting the idea of Dawson's ownership of them, the evidence that they do present is merely consistent with the idea rather than actively forwarding the case. The strongest evidence for Dawson having owned all or the vast majority of the volumes in the cache, and for their having constituted material stages in the writing and printing of Hastings Castle , lies in just four of them: Henderson's Documents ; the Chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon ; vol. I of Thierry's History of the Conquest , and the Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy of Ordericus Vitalis. The copy of Henderson's Documents has the publisher's 24-page 'Catalogue of Bohn's Libraries' bound in at the rear. The catalogue is annotated in pencil where it deals with 'Bohn's Antiquarian Library' (pp. 10-11). One title is marked with a cross (Matthew of Westminster's Flowers of History, Especially Such as Relate to the Affairs of Britain, from the Beginning of the World to A.D. 1307 ). Another title is marked with a deleted cross (Matthew Paris's English History, from 1235 to 1273 ). Fifteen other titles are ticked: Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Asser's Life of Alfred Bede's Ecclesiastical History of England Florence of Worcester's Chronicle Chronicle of Geoffrey of Monmouth Chronicle of Gildas Historical Works of Giraldus Cambrensis Henry of Huntingdon's History Chronicle of Nennius Ordericus Vitalis's Ecclesiastical History Chronicle of Richard of Cirencester Roger de Hoveden's Annals of English History Roger of Wendover's Flowers of History Six Old English Chronicles William of Malmesbury's Chronicle The ticked titles include all the Bohn's Antiquarian Library volumes in the cache (which are also all the volumes above proposed as 'primary sources' for Hastings Castle ). There is one apparent exception, which is the volume in which the annotated catalogue itself appears. The reason for its omission is that as the title does not itself appear in the catalogue, it could not be ticked: although Henderson's Documents was published in 1892, the same year as the catalogue (March 1892), the catalogue appears simply not to have been completely updated. Meanwhile, what this particular act of annotation suggests is that the collocation of the copies in the cache is on the whole by no means fortuitous, and that the majority of them cohere as a fragment of a discrete historical collection of antiquarian texts. Moreover, even when reconstructed only in respect of its holdings of Bohn's Antiquarian Library editions, that collection was certainly somewhat larger than the extant group of copies. It is at least a reasonable speculation that the ticked titles represent holdings in that historical collection while the crossed title represents a deficiency in the collection which the annotator felt needed remedying. The deleted cross is possibly explained by the fact that the text of Matthew Paris's English History is, lower down the catalogue page, reattributed to Roger of Wendover and presented by the publishers in another edition. This title the annotator ticks, presumably then returning to delete the cross by the edition which attributes the work to Matthew Paris. Indeed, the presence of crosses as well as ticks suggests that these annotations are more than a post facto taking stock of books in the collection: rather they have the appearance of reflecting the musings of a scholar checking off what he possesses, what he does not possess, and what he really ought to get hold of. If one were wholly confident that these annotations were Dawson's, they would clearly help confirm that the books in the cache were his own copies, as well as indicating something of the wider contents of his library in 1892 or later. The evidence from this particular volume for moving to those conclusions is very slight, but it continues to point in that direction. For example, in the Documents (p. 12) the names of John, Count of Eu, and of William of Hastings are selected for underlining out of a long list of the names of nobles who witnessed the Constitutions of Clarendon. Bearing in mind that six members of the Eu family (including John) successively held Hastings Castle following the original grant by William the Conqueror (and that they figure prominently in Dawson's study), this particular annotation does not, at the very least, conflict with the proposition that the annotator here was the author of Hastings Castle . Moreover, a number of the titles which the annotator ticked but which do not happen to be represented in the cache are nevertheless texts which Dawson did use, and quote from, in Hastings Castle : the chronicle of Florence of Worcester and that of William of Malmesbury are cases in point. In other words, the profile of the larger collection of antiquarian texts indicated by the ticks is indeed what one might anticipate as appropriate titles for a scholar working in the area covered by Hastings Castle . The annotations to the Chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon relate far more closely to the text of Hastings Castle . Among these, the opening of the chronicler's paragraph-long entry for A.D. 490 is marked with two horizontal lines in pencil and the word 'Begin', while the paragraph closes with similar marks and the word 'End' (p. 45). The marked lines are quoted to precisely these boundaries in Hastings Castle (vol. I, p. 12, note 2). However, they are also quoted a little too fully. Forester's edition of the Chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon has a footnote to the sixth line of the quoted passage; curiously, Dawson's footnote reproduces not only the passage but also Forester's related footnote of approximately fifty words. It does so quite without acknowledgement, interpolating Forester's words by breaking the quotation of the text at the point where the original note was keyed in. Effectively this is plagiarism. However, there is something to be said in mitigation or explanation. Forester's note refers to 'the great wood mentioned in a preceding note' (i.e. a preceding note of Forester's to the Chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon ), but by chance Dawson also had an immediately preceding note to the text of Hastings Castle mentioning the same wood (vol. I, p. 11), and so the borrowing would certainly have sat far less conspicuously in the proofs than it might have done—and this perhaps explains how Dawson himself came to overlook it. As far as 'Begin' and 'End' are concerned, these terms must be assumed to be Dawson's notes, possibly to himself, just possibly to a compositor, but most probably to a secretary, to transcribe (or set up in type) the passage for use in Hastings Castle . There is one substantive variant in Forester's reproduced note: Forester's awkward expression 'the subsequent details of Henry of Huntingdon' is improved to 'the subsequent description given by Henry of Huntingdon'. While an authorial hand is apparent in this stylistic emendation, the inclusion of Forester's note at all tends to suggest a scribe's mechanical and over-dutiful transcription which Dawson failed to register as a blunder. Any other interpretation provides a crumb for the detractors of Dawson as 'underhand scoundrel' ( Piltdown . . . Forgery , p. 10). Elsewhere, a long section of the text of the Chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon is marked with a pencilled line in the margin, running from near the foot of p. 209 to near the foot of p. 212; again the words 'Begin' and 'End' appear in the margins. This marked section includes Henry of Huntingdon's entire account of the Battle of Hastings. It also duly represents the exact span of Henry of Huntingdon's account quoted by Dawson in his battle sheets, broken into units appearing on sheets 3A, 5, 6, 7A, 8B, 9B and 11A. Elsewhere in the volume, a pencilled marginal annotation reading 'trans?' by a reference to William II's 'infamous debauchery' (p. 240) suggests (as do a number of less articulate squiggles) that the annotator was not at all happy with the general quality of Forester's translation. It is indeed the case that the version of the Battle of Hastings from the Chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon that appears in Dawson's battle sheets is considerably emended stylistically. Further, within this marked section, a pencilled marginal note (p. 212) relates to Forester's use of the phrase 'making a rampart' (which the annotator underlines): the marginal note reads, in modification of the printed expression, ' quasi a sort of castle'. The relevant passage in the printed battle sheets departs from Forester to read 'making a castle as it were of them'. Read as a sequence ('making a rampart' [Forester] / ' quasi a sort of castle' [annotation] / 'making a castle as it were of them' [ Hastings Castle ]) these phrases enact the development of Dawson's phraseology out of Forester's, the annotation constituting a transitional stage in the evolution of the text as printed in Hastings Castle . The annotation also gives some substance to one of Dawson's prefactory statements: The author believes that average readers will prefer to read their ancient records and chronicles, in the same way as most people read their Bibles, that is, by means of a translation, and he has provided accordingly. . . . Where previous translations have been adopted, care has been taken to check them by the aid of the best evidence available. (vol. I, pp. v-vi) As a general point, then, Dawson can certainly be shown to have put work into modifying and improving some of the translations that he presented in the battle sheets; others, however, he let stand as they were, and perhaps simply because he was quite satisfied with them. What, however, may well be regretted is that his references to the early authorities do not deal in references to editions (and so not in page or line numbers), nor, beyond the general declaration in his preface, does he specify which accounts are taken verbatim from existing editions or which have undergone modification (and how). Here, however, one is left in a double-bind, responding with one set of expectations to the impression of considerable scholarship that Dawson conveys, yet also aware of his stated concern to provide for an 'average reader', leaving one unsure where to excuse and where to condemn. Is the absence of a bibliography a scholarly failing? Does Dawson's justification of his limited index (prepared in any case by another hand) hold water? Certainly his formal notes on the authorities represented in the battle sheets gave him an appropriate place to note information about editions and the modification of particular translations (vol. II, pp. 567-568), and even the introductions to Bohn's editions (such as Giles's) could have reminded him of the decorum; instead, he arguably chose to create a slightly misleading impression of the depth of his scholarship by rather noting in each case the language and date of 'the oldest-known manuscript now extant'. In this context it is also hard to overlook the fact that, at the time Dawson was working, Bohn editions of the classics (at least) did have a standing reputation as the English schoolboy's crib for translation exercises. In The Hill , Horace Vachell's 1905 novel about Harrow School, an older boy warns younger ones that 'You kids ought not to use "Bohns". Besides, its dangerous.' The context of the use of Bohn editions in The Hill (boys cheating in their schoolwork and thereby risking punishment) is of course a very different one, and one involving different materials, to the case of the composition of Hastings Castle . Nevertheless, with such connotations, Dawson's silence about his use of Bohn editions as working sources might well be interpreted as a sin of omission. As far as the Chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon is concerned, there can be little doubt that the pencilled notes are Dawson's own. As for the instructions 'Begin' and 'End' in this case, such are the differences between Forester's translation and the version that Dawson presented in the battle sheets that there is no room to propose that the annotations constitute Dawson's instructions to a compositor. Instead, the likelihood is again that these are Dawson's instructions to a secretary (though with a reminder to himself about the work to be done on improving the translation), perhaps in the context of arranging a transcription of this section of the Chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon more conveniently laid out for the subsequent work of stylistic emendation than the closely set pages of the Bohn's Antiquarian Library edition. The interest of vol. I of Thierry's History of the Conquest lies in the annotation of Appendix VII, which is devoted to presenting, in Norman French, 'Poetical Narrative of the Battle of Hastings'. Here the word 'Begin' appears as a pencilled annotation at the head of a passage from the narrative of Geoffroi Gaimar; the instruction 'End' appears at the conclusion of a longer passage from the narrative of Benoit de Sainte-Maure which immediately follows on in the appendix. In the battle sheets in Hastings Castle an English translation of Geoffroi Gaimar's narrative appears on sheets 2A, 4, 8B and 11A, and of Benoit de Saint-Maure's on sheets 1A, 2A, 3, 3A, 4, 5, 6, 6B, 7A, 8B, 9B, 11A, 12, 12A. In the case of Geoffroi Gaimar, the translation running through the battle sheets duly begins with the first and ends with the last line of the marked passage in the appendix to Thierry. Just one block of six lines between the first and second extracts appears not to have been used. The case of the Benoit de Sainte-Maure narrative is rather different. The extracts translated in the early battle sheets (1A, 2A, 3, 3A) fall outside the lines quoted in the Thierry appendix. Nevertheless, the translated extract on Sheet 4 ends with the opening three lines of the appendix passage. The subsequent extracts then translate nearly the entirety of the long passage quoted in the appendix, though with some reordering of the material (and in which process just one or two lines appear to have been omitted). On sheet 12A the final translated extract from Benoit de Sainte-Maure also extends, by a few paragraphs, beyond the lines quoted in the appendix. In this context, however, there is an interesting pencil annotation at the conclusion of the Benoit de Sainte-Maure passage in the appendix which reads: '[The Duke placed a guard in Hastings from the best of his knights, so as to garrison the castle well &amp; went thence to Romend (Romney)] (Beniot de Sainte-Mre)'. This may indicate that the annotator already found the appendix extract too short for his purposes, and that he was noting further lines to be presented—or indeed indicating the further boundary of the required supplement. The translation of the narrative of Benoit de Sainte-Maure does indeed end on sheet 12A with a short paragraph beginning: 'At Hastings he put guards. With his best knights he garrisoned the Castle; thence he went to Romney.' One further annotation, though cryptic, is also of interest. A unit of two or three lines in the appendix is marked with green crayon, and this unit turns out to be one of the three units of the passage which in translation are presented out of their original order. In respect of vol. I of Thierry's History of the Conquest , then, Dawson's hand as annotator again seems evident. 'Begin' and 'End' once more appear to be instructions to a secretary to transcribe the Norman French narratives in order to provide a working copy of some kind en route to establishing an edited translation, a task which clearly must have required Dawson to supplement Thierry's appendix with a fuller version of Benoit de Sainte-Maure's narrative. Although matters were here at an early stage of development, the annotations also suggest that Dawson was already thinking ahead to the shape and extent of that translation as it would appear in the battle sheets. The copy of vol. I of the Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy by Ordericus Vitalis is the most striking of the working volumes and shows a number of different layers of annotation. There is one discrete phase of pencilled marks running through pp. 454-465, in manner resembling the annotation of the Annals of Roger de Hoveden (though with the incidental interest that they specifically relate to pages dealing with the years 1061-1066). Pages 480-488, however, specifically dealing with the Battle of Hastings, are annotated in pencil, in green crayon and in black ink. In addition, interleaving in the form of a number of annotations on slips glued between leaves occurs between pp. 480/481 (two separate slips annotated in ink on the verso), and between pp. 482/483 and 484/485 (where in each case there is one larger slip with annotations in ink on both recto and verso). Together, these features make this section of the Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy the most formally and intensively annotated section of any of the working volumes. While much of the present discussion has necessarily dealt with the implications of non-verbal annotation, this portion of the Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy displays words, phrases and sentences as annotations, and so provides an opportunity to consider the identity of the handwriting concerned. In brief, as far as all annotation in pencil and green crayon is concerned, here and through the rest of the volumes (with the exception of Hart's signature in Russell's History ), comparison with Charles Dawson's handwriting in correspondence as held by the Natural History Museum provides a high degree of corroboration that such annotations are in Dawson's hand. 7 However, the annotations in black ink in this volume present distinctive characteristics, to which I shall return. Of the more striking annotations here, the familiar instruction 'Begin' occurs in the margin of p. 480, this time between two lines, and on this occasion in green crayon. On p. 481 there are more horizontal lines in the margin, together with the note 'Sheet 3', again in green. On p. 482 there is an annotation in the form of pencilled lines but also more green crayon in the form of vertical and horizontal lines, and again the instruction 'Sheet 3'. Green crayon lines and a cross also occur on p. 483, while on p. 487 there is the instruction 'end' in green crayon, subsequently struck out in pencil with the instruction 'see next page' where a further short section is lined and marked 'Begin' and 'End' in pencil (p. 488). Phrases written on the interleaved slips are lucidly keyed into the text on the facing page by means of numbers and lower-case letters. All the inked annotations in the text, as well as in the margins and in the interleaving, deal in emendations to the substance and expression of the text of the Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy as printed. In the event, however, Hastings Castle only made use of two short extracts from Ordericus Vitalis in battle sheets 2A and 4. Nevertheless, the extract on sheet 2A significantly incorporates the emended reading found on the first annotated slip in the working volume: 'Landed safely on the coast of England, took possession of Pevensey and Hastings' (p. 481) is emended on the slip and in the battle sheet to 'rejoicing, seized the shore of the Sea, then occupied Pevensey and Hastings'. Moreover, the two lines in green crayon define the start and finish of this extract. Similarly, the extract on battle sheet 4 is marked out on pp. 482-483 of the Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy by means of the green lines and cross. However, it is puzzling why only two short paragraphs were eventually used, when approximately seven pages of the text had been so carefully emended, the whole involving some thirty separate substantive emendations. This is the more surprising when one follows through the layers of annotation, and surmises their function. The first layer appears to consist of pencillings that have the same characteristics as those of pp. 454-465 and which again suggest an informal process of reading and highlighting. Possibly belonging to the same phase, but more probably constituting a more formal second layer, is the pencil annotation on p. 488 involving the instructions 'Begin' and 'End'. This seems strictly analogous with the annotations to vol. I of Thierry's History of the Conquest and the Chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon , and on that basis implies instructions to a secretary regarding transcription of the passage. In this case, however, Dawson may have changed his mind about developing his version of the account of Ordericus Vitalis from a transcription, and instead gone ahead with an attempt to emend the translation in situ . (The translation was again by his bugbear Forester.) The distinctive and elaborate nature of this process, involving interleaving, the use of black ink, conscientious keying-in and carefully formed written characters, suggests that here Dawson was directly preparing copy for the printer. These processes constituted the third level of annotation. A fourth level is then apparent in the green crayon instructions 'Begin', 'end' and 'Sheet 3'. Sheet 3 in Hastings Castle covers 'Messages between the Duke of Normandy and Harold King of England' and also 'Incidents of King Harold's Preparations and Councils': the passages here marked 'Sheet 3' do indeed fall into those categories. Clearly the planning of the sheets was fairly well advanced at the stage these annotations were made (though possibly not so well advanced or indeed so manageable that Dawson could assign the remainder of the pages to their appropriate battle sheets). Here, the green crayon 'Begin' and 'end' look like further instructions to the printer rather than to a secretary. A fifth layer of annotation is apparent when the word 'end' is deleted and attention drawn to one more paragraph over the page, which, though previously marked, Dawson had presumably overlooked, the deletion and instruction representing an emendation of his first instruction to the printer. At this point, then, one appears to be looking at the fullest extent of the extract which Dawson at one point proposed to include from the Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy . Eventually, however, the extract was decimated (and hence the sixth layer of annotation, the green-crayon definition of the two extracts that were ultimately printed in battle sheets 2A and 4). Such is the difference in length between the proposed extract and what was actually included, that one can only infer that Dawson came up against severe problems of space in the battle sheets and that this required considerable rethinking of them at a late stage. In such technical problems in handling the battle sheets lies the most reasonable explanation for the delay in the book's publication and for Dawson's relief, in July 1910, at getting the whole project 'off his hands'. There remains a problem, however, concerning the handwriting of the annotations in black ink in the margins and the interleaving of The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy . These are in a carefully formed print-hand, and the character formation differs markedly from Dawson's usual script-hand. However, towards the end of the interleaving, the print-hand begins to deviate into script. This may suggest that the print-hand was a rather stilted medium, temporarily adopted for purposes of clarity, and indeed as the script re-emerges there are some indications that it may well be Dawson's hand which is again in evidence. However, confident attribution of the distinctive print-hand to Dawson must remain in abeyance. If it is not his hand, it may be that Dawson did after all improve the translation via a transcription and that a secretary entered up these rather finicky emendations for the printer. There is an alternative possibility that Dawson delegated the improvement of the translation to another scholar, and that it is that scholar's hand that appears here. However, Dawson had been more than happy to emend Forester's translation of the Chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon himself, and if the print-hand is not Dawson's, then there seems no strong reason to look beyond the explanation of an intervenient secretary. The degree of correlation between the annotation and the printed battle sheets means that there can be no doubt that this copy of the Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy was one of Charles Dawson's working volumes in his preparation of Hastings Castle . There is also a strong likelihood that it represents what was at one stage intended as the printer's copy, emended in meticulous detail to that end by Dawson—possibly assisted by a secretary. The continuities in patterns of annotation, and the separate correlations of annotation and the battle sheets, mean that the copies of vol. I of Thierry's History of the Conquest and of the Chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon were similarly working volumes of Dawson's, though probably containing in their annotations instructions to a secretary rather than to the printer. The copy of Henderson's Documents sets itself in a very likely collective relationship, as one of Dawson's copies, not only with the Chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon and the Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy , but also with the copies of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of England and both volumes of the Annals of Roger de Hoveden . If volume II of Thierry's History of the Conquest also creeps into the Dawsonian fold on the strength of the case made by its sibling volume, then Cicero's Orations and Hart's copy of Russell's History alone depend for their status as books from Charles Dawson's library on the bare fact of their physical association with the cache as a whole. From the annotations to Henderson's Documents can then be deduced some of the other antiquarian works in Dawson's library. The annotations also testify to a certain energy if also a limitation in the depth of Dawson's methods of working, and to some problems caused, arguably, by over-ambition and by loose scholarly method. While they suggest no fraud on the scale of Piltdown, they do perhaps suggest a man not afraid of taking a short-cut or two. Admittedly, as far as his role at Piltdown was to be concerned, such a characteristic qualified Dawson as much for the role of hoaxed as for the role of hoaxer.</field>

By the time of the British Museum investigations his firm had moved to the 'Old Grammar School' in nearby Church Street (premises which were not commercially available until after 1930). Some materials connected with Dawson, such as the books discussed, may have escaped wartime recycling simply because they were dispersed earlier, perhaps during the change of premises. 4 'The proliferation of suspects has been due to a limited knowledge of the primary archival materials and a corresponding lack of detailed information on the activities of the individuals who were either directly or indirectly involved.'

      <field name="heading_text">Paulding's Anonymous Writings: New Attributions and Speculations by Ralph M. Aderman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Anonymity in writing for public consumption was the rule for a long time in the nineteenth century; and even after writers had achieved recognition for their literary efforts, they often continued to publish without signing their names. For some the sheer pleasure of writing was sufficient reward; recognition of authorship was not necessary. Such a one was James Kirke Paulding, who probably began his literary career with poems and prose contributed to New York magazines while he was still in his teens 1 and who continued with offerings to Peter Irving's Morning Chronicle under the pen name of Walter Withers and to Irving's short-lived Corrector (1804). These were followed with his unacknowledged efforts in some of the popular magazines 2 and in Salmagundi (1807-08), a joint venture with Washington and William Irving. After that collaboration it is difficult to chart Paulding's publications. On his numerous visits to Philadelphia he probably renewed his acquaintance with Joseph Dennie and contributed an occasional piece to the Port Folio . Several items signed "P." bear the unmistakable stamp of Paulding's prose and verse. 3 In view of his later tendency to contribute frequently to publications that accepted his work (the Analectic Magazine and the New-York Mirror , for example) it is possible that he wrote articles and poems for the Port Folio which were not identified, even with an initial. 4 When Select Reviews and Spirit of Foreign Magazines , edited by his friend Samuel Ewing, started in Philadelphia in 1809, Paulding was said to be one of the contributors of original material. 5 Since most of the contents was copied from British and American reviews, the journal contains only a small amount of original writing; and that is published anonymously. Paulding's offerings have not been identified. The appearance in 1812 of the National Advocate , a newspaper edited by Henry Wheaton for Tammany Hall, provided Paulding with an opportunity to express his patriotic feelings during the increasing tension with England. He wrote anonymous, still unidentified essays attacking the British and supporting American independence. 6 He continued writing for newspapers after he went to Washington in 1815; there he sent at least twenty-one letters to the National Intelligencer under the pseudonym of "Parvus Homo." 7 Many of these letters were a part of a running debate with a proponent of paper money writing as "Homo" over issues of paper currency, decentralized control of banks, and speculation. Paulding argued for Congressional control of banking and the use of specie as the basis for a national currency. When he struck out on his own in book form with The Diverting History of John Bull and Brother Jonathan (1812), he kept on with the practice of anonymity and continued it for the next twenty years. It should be noted, however, that knowledgeable readers were often aware of his authorship of poems, essays, and tales. 8 Sometimes he used a pseudonym, as he did in John Bull and Brother Jonathan , where the authorship was attributed to "Hector Bull-Us." In Salmagundi, Second Series the author was identified as Launcelot Langstaff, whom discerning readers immediately recognized as one of the characters in the original Salmagundi . On other occasions one of his books might be attributed to the author of John Bull and Brother Jonathan , as happened in the case of Letters from the South (1817). In similar fashion when Paulding collected into book form stories and tales that had first appeared in the magazines, he did not include his name as author. The Book of Saint Nicholas (1836) consisted mainly of stories published in the New-York Mirror , some anonymously and some with his name. When A Gift from Fairy Land (1838) was being printed, Paulding, then in Washington serving as secretary of the Navy, cautioned William Kemble, his brother-in-law who was seeing the book through the press in New York, not to reveal his identity, for "it would not Sound well for a Cabinet minister to be writing Fairy Tales." 9 For Paulding writing provided not only an outlet for his fanciful stories and perceptive views on a variety of subjects; it also served as a means of occupying his time in a pleasing manner. Along with recreation and delight it provided him with funds which supplemented his regular income. During the period of heated debate over the suspension of specie payments following the demise of the First Bank of the United States Paulding entered the fray with an anonymous pamphlet entitled "The History of a Little Frenchman and His Bank Notes. Rags! Rags! Rags!" (1815). The pamphlet told the story of a Frenchman who converted his gold into paper bank notes in Savannah and watched them decline in value as he traveled north and tried to use them to pay his bills. The parable provided Paulding with an opportunity to attack the widespread use of paper money largely unsupported by specie deposits and to advocate a return to the use of hard money for commercial transactions and the payment of debts. 10 While most of Paulding's unsigned writings have been identified through republication in collections, through self-acknowledgment, or through the reports of others, some efforts still await positive identification. 11 Many of them appeared anonymously in various newspapers where it is difficult, if not impossible, to pick out some of the items he wrote. Occasionally he would indicate in a letter that he had been writing for a particular newspaper or magazine, but he did not list specific titles or subjects, thus leaving the investigator today with only a vague reference. When he moved to Washington in 1815, he furnished articles for the National Intelligencer , the administration organ, but much of his unsigned material lies unrecognized in the files of the paper. 12 In one instance, after a lapse of nearly thirty years, Lewis Gaylord Clark stated that Paulding had contributed "searching and sarcastic articles, involving 'England and the English'" to the Morning Courier and New-York Enquirer during and after the visit of Harriet Martineau to the United States from 1834 to 1836. 13 An examination of the file of the newspaper failed to locate items that can be specifically assigned to Paulding because his views coincided with those of the editor. Similarly, he wrote for the New-York Evening Post when the paper actively supported the Democratic administrations in the 1830s, 14 but again it is not possible to designate certain articles as Paulding's. A few of Paulding's contributions to magazines have hitherto escaped notice as well. Soon after his return to New York in 1824 he wrote several pieces for the New York Review and Athenaeum Magazine , a periodical edited by William Cullen Bryant, who had recently come to the city. He persuaded Paulding to lend his pen to the new literary enterprise, 15 and Paulding obliged with "The Literary Trifler," "A Letter of Adrian Lubbersen," and "The Beau's Tale." 16 These stories, replete with heavy-handed moralizing, provided a bit of relief and entertainment from the serious fare of most of the articles. If the magazine had not failed, Paulding probably would have continued to write for it. In 1835 Paulding wrote a review of Catherine Maria Sedgick's The Linnwoods; or "Sixty Years Since" in America , which William Gilmore Simms sent to Daniel Kimball Whittaker, editor of the Southern Literary Journal, and Monthly Magazine . Paulding's assessment noted her "pure and unaffected style . . . equally free from vulgarity and exaggeration" and her "taste and good sense." 17 Upon the completion of two novels after he had retired in 1845 to a farm near Hyde Park Paulding looked for other writing projects to occupy his time and provide an opportunity for him to express his views on current political problems, especially those relating to the Compromise of 1850, abolition, and the threat to national unity. After the Democratic Review printed his letter to Robert J. Dillon and other members of the Hunker faction of the New York Democratic party Paulding sent three articles to it in rapid succession. 18 These essays addressed issues occurring in the Congressional debates over free soil and fugitive slaves. Earlier Paulding had written an eloquent defense of black servitude in Slavery in the United States (1836), and he still felt that slaveholding, which was protected by the Constitution, should be approved or rejected by the individual states, not the federal government. He protested against the inflammatory tactics of the abolitionists, calling them Puritans and fanatics who were willfully leading the country toward disunion. As a staunch believer in the physical integrity of the United States, Paulding regarded these actions as totally irresponsible. Paulding may have continued to write for the Democratic Review during the remainder of the editorship of Thomas P. Kettell, which extended through 1851; but without evidence relating to Paulding's involvement it is not possible to make positive attributions. In 1852 George N. Sanders edited the magazine and used it as a vehicle to promote the political ambitions of Stephen A. Douglas by attacking the "Old Fogies" among the Democrats. 19 Although Paulding probably did not write for Sanders, he obviously continued to read the Review and used the epithet "Old Fogy" occasionally thereafter. 20 After Sanders relinquished the editorship of the magazine and it changed its name to the United States Review , Paulding took an active role in its support of pro-Southern, states' rights Democrats. The new editor, Theodore A. Foster, was a long-standing acquaintance who had once served as Paulding's boatman on fishing forays on the Hudson River, and he now applied to his old friend for assistance in the venture. As Paulding put it, As he had often in bygone days, lent me an oar, I thought I would now lend him one in return, and have accordingly largely contributed, and shall probably continue to contribute to the work. I have not the slightest pecuniary interest it, &amp; all my contributions are gratuitous. It is perfectly well understood however that I shall continue to aid the Review only so long as it maintains my principles. 21 From his home he wrote essays and offered advice on the conduct of the magazine. By his own testimony Paulding "largely contributed" to the United States Review under Foster's editorship and continued when D. W. Holly succeeded him later in 1853. From his association with the magazine we can positively identify seven offerings: "The Apotheosis of Dullness," n.s. 1 (February 1853): 115-119. "Six Weeks in the Moon," n.s. 1 (June 1853): 513-522. "The British Spy; or The Three Honest Men and True," n.s. 2 (August 1853): 117-125. "Dawn in the Highlands of the Hudson," n.s. 2 (September 1853): 218-220. "Song" ("Sweet is the breath of morn that blows"), n.s. 2 (September 1853): 225. "The Stripes and Stars," n.s. 2 (September 1853): 272-273. (This and the preceding poem are preserved in manuscript versions in the copybook of Paulding's poems in the University of Pennsylvania Library, pp. 44, 39.) "The Eyes and the Spectacles," n.s. 3 (November 1854): 446. These poems and sketches are all nonpolitical, were written earlier, and were taken from his portfolio of manuscripts for use in the Review . 22 In addition, Paulding wrote essays on topics relating to slavery, abolition, states' rights, defense of the Democratic party, foreign relations, the eastern question, and national politics while he was closely associated with the journal. Since he never stated precisely what he had written, it is necessary to look for articles on the subjects of primary interest to him and for any stylistic traits which might reveal his authorship. On these grounds the following pieces may have been written by him: "Foreign and Continental Policy of the United States," n.s. 1 (January 1853): 1-11. Places strong emphasis on states' rights. "The Message. Political Considerations Suggested by the President's Message of December 1852," n.s. 1 (February 1853): 97-114. Reflects Paulding's views: "Clearly, the one grand effect of Democracy is to maintain the liberties and sovereignties of states against centralization." Paulding was an assiduous reader of Presidential messages to Congress. "John Bull, Esquire," n.s. 1 (March 1853): 236-247. Deals with the John Bull-Brother Jonathan idea which he had initiated forty years earlier. "Blackwood's Magazine Article—Slavery and Slave Power in the United States," n.s. 1 (April 1853): 289-323. Attacks British attitudes toward the United States, alludes to the misrepresentations of British travelers, and discusses the American treatment of slaves. These were topics Paulding had earlier dealt with in The United States and England (1815), Letters from the South (1817), and John Bull in America (1825). "The United States and the United Kingdom," n.s. 1 (May 1853): 385-414. Continues the attack started in the previous issue and reflects his concern with the British influence in the western hemisphere. "Brother Jonathan," n.s. 1 (May 1853): 433-439. Uses the Jonathan figure again. Discusses American life and points out such weaknesses as imitativeness, fanaticism, gullibility, and materialism—all topics which had long concerned Paulding. "The Power of Congress over Internal Improvements," n.s. 1 (June 1853): 566-572. Deals with issues of internal improvements and states' rights, expressing views similar to those held by Paulding at this time. "Democracy—What Is It?" n.s. 2 (July 1853): 1-28. Emphasizes states' rights and equality, attacks banks, domestic industry, and internal improvements. Paulding echoes some of the same sentiments in his letter to Joseph S. Sims, October 6, 1853. "The Federal Power of Taxation," n.s. 2 (July 1853): 56-64. Attacks Whigs for advocating higher tariffs and higher taxes to pay for internal improvements. "The Union of the Democratic Party," n.s. 2 (July 1853): 84-90. Reflects Paulding's concern with party harmony and unity. "Supplementary Visit to the Moon," n.s. 2 (August 1853): 125-143. A sequel to his parable in the June 1853 issue. "National Literature and the International Copy-Right Treaty," n.s. 2 (August 1853): 97-117. Calls for originality and nationalism in American writing, urges freedom from British writing which is undemocratic and often inflammatory in its agitation against slavery. Echoes many of Paulding's long-standing ideas. "Fanny Fern," n.s. 2 (August 1853): 187-190. An assault on a popular woman writer, "a charming little humbug" and the sister of N. P. Willis, whom Paulding detested because of earlier personal attacks on him in The Corsair in 1839. 23 "The Spirit of the Times; or The Fast Age," n.s. 2 (September 1853): 257-263. Reflects Paulding's feelings about progress, change, and speed, subjects about which he held pronounced conservative views. "The Power of Congress over Internal Improvements," n.s. 2 (September 1853): 273-276. A sequel to the June article on the same subject, this one focusing on harbor improvements by the federal government. "Abolition vs. the Union," n.s. 2 (June 1854): 289-316. An essay on a subject about which Paulding felt strongly. It is the lead article in the first issue of the Review to appear after the suspension of publication in September 1853. 24 "Nathaniel Parker Willis," n.s. 2 (June 1854): 340-344. A disparaging review of Willis's Sacred Poems and Dramas pointing out his lack of ideas, talent, and artistry. A belated retaliation against Willis's attack on Paulding in 1839. The reviewer also refers to himself as an "old gentleman." "Turkey and Russia," n.s. 2 (June 1854): 373-375. Reiterates some of the same ideas he expressed in his articles in the Washington Union in March 1854 while the Review was suspended. (See below.) "Compromises," n.s. 3 (July 1854): 1-16. States views on the nature of the Constitution and the power of the people similar to those held by Paulding. "Holidays," n.s. 3 (July 1854): 56-66. Attacks English travelers who ridicule American customs as low and vulgar, talks about and illustrates Dutch holiday customs as he had done in the articles and tales in The Book of Saint Nicholas (1836). "Abolition and Sectarian Mobs," n.s. 3 (August 1854): 97-120. A reprise of Paulding's pet peeves from canting ministers, fanatic abolitionists, and lady reformers to enemies of the Constitution. Uses "progress of the human mind," a favorite phrase. In a letter to Joseph S. Sims he speaks of ministers becoming politicians. 25 "What is Slavery?" n.s. 3 (October 1854): 342-344. Contrasts British and American attitudes toward slavery, approves of paternalistic treatment of slaves by American owners. Reiterates ideas from Letters from the South and Slavery in the United States . "The Czar of Russia," n.s. 4 (January 1855): 1-13. Repeats some of the same ideas in the article of June 1854. "Saint Jonathan," n.s. 4 (February 1855): 99-106. A tongue-in-cheek discussion of one of Paulding's favorite symbols of Americanism. "Perils of Our Steam Marine," n.s. 4 (February 1855): 122-124. Shows knowledge of steamboats and their construction, details which Paulding acquired while Secretary of the Navy. "The Common Defense and General Welfare," n.s. 4 (May 1855): 405-410. Attacks the extension of the powers of the federal government, praises the Constitution as "one of the simplest, clearest, most explicit, productions that ever emanated from the human brain, and as easily comprehended as the ten commandments." "Monopoly and Paper-Money," n.s. 4 (June 1855): 435-441. Treats a subject on which Paulding had long held strong feelings. "Puritanism and Abolitionism," n.s. 5 (July 1855): 79-85. Expresses views about the relationship of Puritanism and fanaticism in the actions of several states concerning the Fugitive Slave Law. Paulding frequently linked abolitionism with Puritanism and fanaticism in the early 1850s. With this essay Paulding probably severed his connection with the United States Review . In a letter to a Southern friend in mid-October of 1855 he stated that I have not written anything for the U.S. Review the last two or three months and shall probably write no more. It is a ricketty concern, perpetually changing hands. . . . though in the first instance, I had in great measure control of its political course. I have not interfered with it under its last two publishers, though I have occasionally contributed an article. I am no longer responsible for its course &amp; it has been intimated to me, that there is a probability it will fall into hands that will give it a new direction. I therefore wish you at present at least to consider me disconnected with the Review, until I see which way the wind blows. But the South requires a stout advocate here, and it is to be regretted that it has not one in which it can place sufficient confidence to justify a liberal patronage." 26 Paulding seems not to have contributed to the magazine after this time. His writings for the United States Review consist primarily of timely political pieces and tales and poems he had written earlier. The latter appeared most frequently during the early part of his connection with the magazine and were doubtless offered to provide variety to a miscellany which was largely political in nature. In addition, they were materials that he had readily at hand and could easily copy and send off. The serious articles reflect Paulding's broad-ranging interests in national and international affairs. Since the magazine was supported by Democrats, its point of view reflected the liberal stance of the party, particularly as it related to the issues of states' rights and the upholding of the Constitution. While it is impossible absolutely to ascribe to Paulding the political writings listed above, they reflect his ideas and feelings during this period. Admittedly the editors and other contributors shared his views, but their style differs in tone, word choice, sentence structure, and rhetorical effect. These elements are difficult to specify, but a reader with a close familiarity with Paulding's writings can sense when the prose style in combination with the ideas is his. For example, Paulding does not use slang expressions; several articles on topics on which he had strong opinions can be rejected as his because the language and phrasing are foreign to his usage. These attributions are based on a long and close familiarity with his prose; they represent an attempt to identify some of his writing at a time when it was thought that he had put aside his pen. During the hiatus when the United States Review had suspended publication Paulding continued to observe national and international political developments and react to them. Since his customary outlet was cut off, he set down his observations in essays which he allowed to accumulate. On March 3, 1854, he sent five articles on the eastern question involving England, France, Russia, and Turkey to A. O. P. Nicholson, editor of the Washington Union , the Democratic newspaper in the capital, offering them for his consideration. He shrewdly pointed out that since these items were communications, not editorial statements, they would not necessarily reflect or endorse the position of the administration. Moreover, he suggested to Nicholson, "If you think any parts of them too spicy You are at full liberty to omit or soften them." 27 Nicholson was sufficiently impressed with the cogency of Paulding's comments to begin printing them as soon as he received them. In a special editorial Nicholson introduced the essays entitled "An American View of the Eastern Question by A Retired Statesman" by observing that One of the ablest statesmen of our country proposes, in a series of numbers, to discuss the Eastern question. His first number appears in our paper today, and it will attract attention, as well by the vigor and beauty of its style as by the independence and fearlessness of his sentiments. Of course, we cannot now be presumed to endorse all the views which the writer may present in his several articles; but we have the best guarantee, in his high standing as a statesman and in his acknowledged abilities, that his sentiments will be purely American, and that they will be presented in the most forcible manner. Our readers will consider themselves fortunate in having the subject elucidated by one so capable of shedding light upon it. 28 The first article appeared on March 8, 1854 and was followed on March 9, 11, 12, and 15 with other pieces. Paulding's reasoned arguments had a positive effect on readers in Washington and elsewhere as the Union was careful to declare: "The late numbers of a 'Retired Statesman' in our paper have produced a sensible influence upon the public mind in our country, whilst the late arrogant announcement of Lord Clarendon as to the objects of the English and French alliance has greatly increased that influence." 29 Nicholson's statement was prompted in part by his receipt of another packet of essays on timely subjects which Paulding had sent off on April 1. 30 Among the additional articles appearing under the authorship of "A Retired Statesman" was a letter from Paris which Paulding had copied off; it was printed on April 5. Following were "New System of Maritime Law" (April 6, 1854), "Central America" (April 11, 1854), "Politics and the Pulpit" (April 16, 1854), "Neutral Rights" (April 25, 1854), and "The Rights of War and Peace" (May 6, 1854). It is not known whether Paulding sent all of these pieces at one time. Perhaps he did, and Nicholson decided to spread them out in order not to overwhelm his readers with Paulding's ideas. In any event, they gave him an opportunity once again to express his opinions about British activities in Eastern Europe and Central America, about fanatical ministers who preach abolitionism, and about British and French acts of search and seizure of American vessels. These were subjects which aroused Paulding to a state of vigorous protest. Another series of shorter observations for the Union called "Obsolete Ideas by an Old Fogy" also has Paulding's stamp upon them. Often in his essays and letters of this period he referred to himself as an "Old Fogy," which in view of his age and some of his unpopular ideas was an appropriate epithet. In one section ("Turkish Toleration," May 27, 1854) Paulding used a figure of speech in which truth, hobbling like a duck, overtakes falsehood, flying on swift wings. In a poem entitled "Truth and Falsehood" published in the preceding year, he used the same image. 31 He alluded in other sections of "Obsolete Ideas" to travel books about the United States written by English visitors "in the true spirt of John Bullism" (June 1, 1854) and to the abuse of the constitutional guarantee of free speech by "a minority of seditious malcontents" (June 8, 1854). Other instances of Paulding's recurring themes could be adduced from "Obsolete Ideas," but the examples above suggest his authorship. Although he had not acknowledged these contributions as his, the unique approach to contemporary issues and the use of certain idiosyncratic phrases make him a prime candidate for authorship. "Obsolete Ideas by an Old Fogy" appeared on April 22, May 2, 27, June 1, 2, and 8, 1854, with treatment of the following topics: No. 1 "Political Fanaticism" No. 2 "European News from the Seat of War," "Mitigating the Evils of War" No. 3 "Inconsistencies and Contradictions," "Turkish Toleration," "The Paris Moniteur" No. 4 "Rights of Women," "Sympathizing" No. 5 "The D---1 in Connecticut," "Odessa," "Tickling John Bull," "Tickling Monsieur," "The New Crusade" No. 6 "The Nebraska Bill," "Protection and Obedience," "The Scriptures," "Congress," "Religion and Morality" Some of the sections are several paragraphs long, and others are very short. The length apparently depended upon the intensity of his reaction. Sometimes he was able to distill his thoughts into a brief, pungent statement. An example of such an apothegm is his reflection on Congress: "Congress is like a silk-worm. It spins its web, lays its eggs, and dies" (June 8, 1854). Paulding's satiric bite is in evidence throughout "Obsolete Ideas" and offers another reason for attributing these selections to him. The identification of these writings suggests the need for a new evaluation of Paulding's activities on the 1850s. It has been commonly assumed that after the publication of his last two novels, The Old Continental (1846) and The Puritan and His Daughter (1849) he settled into placid oblivion on his farm at Hyde Park. In reality, he kept his finger on the political pulse and continued his sturdy support of Democratic principles. He became more insistent in attacking the forces that weakened the Constitution and interfered with the exercise of the individual rights of states. Political expediency or compromise he denounced as undercutting the principles on which the American nation had been founded, and he regarded the actions of abolitionists as fanatical and irrational. For him the preservation of the Union became a dominating concern. On a wider front he espoused the unpopular idea of supporting Russia against Turkey and her allies, England and France. For the latter two he had only contempt because of their efforts to increase their influence in the Western Hemisphere. His distrust of the English had not lessened after forty years of protest, and he found new reasons for concern as he watched her activities in the 1850s. The Paulding who is reflected in the newspaper and magazine writing of the decade before the outbreak of the Civil War is an alert, intense, wellinformed, albeit opinionated, student of the national and international political scene. His strong role in guiding the course of the United States Review during its first dozen issues is a remarkable achievement for a man in his seventies, especially in view of the physical distance separating him from the rest of the editorial staff in New York City. His self-effacement and desire for privacy have prevented readers from recognizing the extent of his involvement in partisan political journalism in the last decade of his life. The items expressly or tentatively identified in this study offer testimony to the energy and concern of the septuagenarian who was supposedly living in retirement, and they show that Paulding's writing continued unabated for more than fifty years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 For example, "Sonnet to Enthusiasm" by "J.P. Aged 14," New-York Magazine 4 (April 1793): 252; "Affecting Epistle to an Heiress," "Evening-Extempore," "Of Knowledge of the World, with Respect to the Follies and Vices of It," New-York Magazine 1 (October 14, 1795): 120; 2 (November 2, 1796): 409-410. These are signed with the initials "J.P." Other examples of Paulding's early poems were enclosed in his letters to Sally Hanlon, August 22, 1800; May 8, 1801; September 3, [1802], in The Letters of James Kirke Paulding , ed. Ralph M. Aderman (1962) 6-7, 9-10, 13, 22. 2 "Advice," signed "P.," ( Port Folio 5 [March 9, 1805]: 72) and a letter and "Song," both signed "P." in Port Folio 5 (September 14, 1805): 288 are probably by Paulding. The tone of the letter and the poems is similar to Paulding's writings of the time. Paulding probably became acquainted with Joseph Dennie, editor of the Port Folio , through William Meredith, with whom Dennie lived when he first moved to Philadelphia. Meredith's wife was Gertrude Gouverneur Ogden, and Paulding's mother was also an Ogden. See Harold Milton Ellis, Joseph Dennie and His Circle (Bulletin of the University of Texas, No. 40. Studies in English, No. 3 [repr. 1971] 113-114. 3 See, for example, the satirical note written in ponderous critical language which accuses Thomas Moore of plagiarizing from Joseph Warton (ser. 3, 1 [June 1809]: 513-514) or poems such as "The Lion and the Hottentot" and "The Eagle and the Bat" (ser. 3, 4 [October 1810]: 377-379) or "The Sick Lion, the Fox, and the Wolf" and "The Shepherd and the Wolf" (ser. 3, 5 [January 1811]: 34-36). 4 Paulding is not included among the identifications in Randolph C. Randall, "Authors of the Port Folio Revealed by the Hall Files," American Literature 11 (January 1940): 379-416. 5 Albert Henry Smyth, Philadelphia Magazines and Their Contributors (1892) 179. Smyth states that Paulding's contributions are marked with a "P." A check of the file of Select Reviews does not turn up any articles with that identification. 6 Frederic Hudson, Journalism in the United States (1969 [reprint of the 1873 edition]) 282-283; Paulding, Manuscript Autobiography (New York Public Library). 7 Paulding's son and biographer identifies his father as the author of the "Parvus Homo" letters in the National Intelligencer . See William I. Paulding, Literary Life of James K. Paulding (1867) 155. A survey of two incomplete files of newspaper discloses twenty-one letters by Parvus Homo between April 23, 1819, and May 8, 1821, appearing as follows: Daily National Intelligencer , April 23, 26, May 15, June 8, 1819; National Intelligencer , May 29, July 7, 1819; November 21, 30, December 14, 1820; January 6, 25, 30, February 10, March 22, 27, 31, April 7, 12, 28, May 3, 8, 1821. In the last ten letters, purportedly written from the Elysian Fields, Paulding turns from banking and monetary matters to comments on the contemporary literary scene, an area in which he doubtless felt more at home. 8 For example, Rebecca Gratz in Philadelphia wrote to her friends about Paulding's authorship of Lay of the Scottish Fiddle (1813), Letters from the South (1817) and The Backwoodsman (1818). See Rebecca Gratz to Mary Eliza Fenno Hoffman, August 30, 1813 (Verplanck Papers, New-York Historical Society); to Maria Hoffman, December 21, 1817, and n.d. [1818?]; and to Benjamin Gratz, November 12, 1818 (all in Gratz Papers, American Jewish Historical Society). See also Gorham A. Worth, American Bards: A Modern Poem in Three Parts (1819) 51; Robert Waln, American Bards, A Satire (1820) 70-71, 79-80; British Review 14 (August 1819): 48; Kaleidoscope, or Literary and Scientific Mirror 2 (March 28, 1820): 148; Literary Chronicle and Weekly Review 4 (May 18, 1822): 312; Retrospective Review 9 (1824): 304; Edinburgh Literary Journal 2 (August 8, 1831): 131. 9 Paulding to William Kemble, September 23, 1838 (letter owned by William Kemble). 10 The pamphlet was published in Philadelphia for the author by Edwa[r]d Earle. A copy in the New-York Historical Society has "by Mr. Paulding" written on the title page. In 1831 George Pope Morris published a notice asking to buy or borrow a copy of the work, noting that it was "written, we believe, by Mr. Paulding." New-York Mirror (January 1, 1831): 203. 11 For example, Paulding contributed to the Encyclopedia Americana , edited by Francis Lieber, but his specific entries have not been identified. See The Life and Letters of Francis Lieber , ed. Thomas Sergeant Perry (1881) 80. For earlier attempts to identify his writings for periodicals see Ralph M. Aderman, "James Kirke Paulding's Contributions to American Magazines," Studies in Bibliography 17 (1964): [141]-151; and Joyce Henry, "Five More Essays by James Kirke Paulding?" Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 66 (Third Quarter 1972): 310-321. 12 A biographical sketch published in 1855 included the following list of newspapers or magazines containing anonymous writings by Paulding: New-York Mirror, Analectic Magazine, Knickerbocker Magazine, Graham's Magazine, Godey's Lady Book, Democratic Review, United States Review, Literary World, Wheaton's National Advocate, National Intelligencer, Southern Press , and Washington Union . See Cyclopaedia of American Literature , ed. Evert A. Duyckinck and George L. Duyckinck (1855) 2: 5. 13 "Editor's Table," Knickerbocker Magazine 56 (July 1860): 87. 14 In offering his support to President Jackson and Vice-President Van Buren, Paulding stated that "I think I can do more good, and more agreeably to my feelings, by making use of the Columns, of the Evening Post, as heretofore . . . . you and the General should Know what I am about; but many considerations make me wish to avoid publicity in this business. By remaining unknown, I can not only write more freely, but avoid the necessity of acting on the defensive, which is always bad policy in Controversies." Paulding to Martin Van Buren, July 8, 1834, in The Letters of James Kirke Paulding 147-148. At about the same time Paulding acknowledged that he was "occupied with political scribbling," again probably in the columns of the New-York Evening Post . See Paulding to Gouverneur Kemble, March 8, 1838 (letter owned by William Kemble). 15 The Letters of William Cullen Bryant , ed. William Cullen Bryant II and Thomas G. Voss (1975) 1: 176. 16 "The Literary Trifler," New York Review and Athenaeum Magazine 1 (July 1825): 146-154; "A Letter from Adrian Lubbersen," 1 (November 1825): 461-471 and 2 (December 1825): 66-70; and "The Beau's Tale" 2 (January 1826): 133-146. 17 See William Gilmore Simms to Daniel Kimball Whittaker, [September 29, 1835], in The Letters of William Gilmore Simms , ed. Mary C. Simms Oliphant and T. C. Duncan Eaves (1982) 6: 5; and Southern Journal 1 (November 1835): 175-176. 18 See Paulding to Robert J. Dillon, James T. Brady, Daniel Sickles, Augustus Schell, and Edward C. West, March 14, 1850, Democratic Review 26 (April 1850): 374-377, reprinted in The Letters of James Kirke Paulding 508-513; "The Conspiracy of Fanaticism," Democratic Review 26 (May 1850): 385-400; "Military Presidents," Democratic Review 26 (June 1850): 481-498; "Fugitive Slaves," Democratic Review 27 July 1850): 57-62. These articles can be ascribed to Paulding because he mentions in a letter to Henry S. Foote, June 3, 1850, that he had sent essays on the slavery question to the magazine. Part of the article on military presidents relating to Andrew Jackson was reprinted in Literary Life of James K. Paulding 287-289. 19 See Frank Luther Mott, A History of American Magazines, 1741-1850 (1957) 682; and Bruce I. Weiner, "The United States Magazine and Democratic Review" in American Literary Magazines: The Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries , ed. Edward E. Chielens (1986) 427. 20 James Kirke Paulding to Joseph S. Sims, April 10, 1852 (letter in William E. Perkins Library, Duke University. Subsequent references to letters to Sims are from the same collection.) See, for example, "Obsolete Ideas by an Old Fogy," which appeared in the Washington Union in April, May, and June of 1854. 21 Paulding to Joseph S. Sims, May 29, 1853. 22 For proof of Paulding's authorship see Aderman, "Paulding's Contributions to American Magazines," p. 146. 23 See "Paulding the Author Disinterred," The Corsair 1 (April 27, 1839): 104-105; (May 4, 1839): 2; (May 18, 1839): 152. 24 At the end of the September 1853 issue the editor made a plea for payment of subscriptions: "A hopeful reliance on the generosity of the American Republican [i.e., Democratic] party induced us to start the Review on a comparatively small capital, and although we have received every encouragement in the way of subscriptions, the delay in making immediate payment of subscriptions on the part of some of our best friends has already occasioned delays of publication, and other business derangements, very injurious to the prospects of the work." United States Review n.s. 2 (September 1853): 288. Paulding attributed the delays in the regular appearance of the Review to "the embarrassments of the Proprietors who commenced the undertaking with little or no capital. Although they have received a considerable patronage, all things considered, it has not been sufficient to keep them going without occasional obstacles and interruptions, and it depends in a great measure on the South, I apprehend, whether it can be continued beyond the present year. It is intended to be essentially a Southern Review, not an Executive organ, and will— so long as I have control over it— remain true to that character." Paulding to Joseph S. Sims, October 6, 1853. The United States Review suspended publication from October 1853 through May 1854 while the proprietors attempted to raise funds to continue. 25 "They seem to be most all turning politicians. . . . By intruding religion into the sphere of politics, and making points of faith not political principles the basis of Party organization, they are unquestionably aiming to place the church above the state and establish a new hierarchy." Paulding to Joseph S. Sims, July 14, 1854. 26 Paulding to Joseph S. Sims, October 13, 1855. 27 Paulding to A. O. P. Nicholson, March 3, 1854, in The Letters of James Kirke Paulding 539. 28 Washington Union , March 8, 1854; quoted in The Letters of James Kirke Paulding 540n. 29 Washington Union , April 5, 1854. 30 Paulding to A. O. P. Nicholson, April 1, 1854, in The Letters of James Kirke Paulding 541. 31 See Literary World 12 (January 15, 1853): 44-45, where the poem appears in a series called "Odds and Ends, by an Obsolete Author." The "Obsolete Author" is akin to the "Old Fogy," and the use of "obsolete" in both the Literary World and the Washington Union is hardly coincidence.</field>
