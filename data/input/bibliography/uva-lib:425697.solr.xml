      <field name="heading_text">From Aldine to Everyman: Cheap Reprint Series of the English Classics 1830-1906 by Richard D. Altick</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A PROMINENT BOOKSELLER," REPORTED AN English book trade journal at the end of the last century, "lately affirmed that the dead are today taking the bread out of the mouths of the living at a rate unparalleled in the history of literature. Even the popular novelist, he said, feels the competition of those who 'rule our spirits from their urn.'" 1 Not that Marie Corelli, Hall Caine, Rider Haggard, and the other best-selling writers of the 1890's were in any danger of starvation. Financially speaking, the profession of authorship had never before been as rewarding. But it was also true that the flood of reprinted classics, which had been steadily mounting for several decades, had reached a new peak. The full history of this important branch of Victorian publishing, a task writer a leader-writer in the Times Literary Supplement a decade ago urged some "industrious bibliographer" to undertake, 2 will not be attempted here. Instead, we shall be concerned mainly with two aspects of cheap-reprint publishing: its relation to the contemporary social and cultural background, and the way in which it illustrates in microcosm some of the theories and practices of the Victorian book trade generally. From one viewpoint, Victorian England was not a very fertile ground on which to sow reprints of the national classics. In some educated quarters, the work of English writers was still looked upon, as it had been in Elizabethan times, as a second-class literature. This attitude is implied in a letter Sir Alexander Grant wrote from Bombay to F. T. Palgrave in 1862, discussing the possibility of adopting Palgrave's Golden Treasury as a classbook for Indian students: "I hope you won't think this a degradation. English poetry is to these people what Homer is to us." 3 Down almost to the end of the century, the old universities were officially unaware of English literature as a subject for serious study. Again, their lofty or complex style, their far-ranging allusiveness, and the sophistication of their thought placed many English classics beyond the grasp of readers with limited education. The mass audience of Victorian times was ill-equipped to understand, let alone find pleasure in, books that had been addressed to the intellectual élite of preceding centuries. In that era, as in any other, it was contemporary writers, speaking their audience's own language, and reflecting their audience's own preoccupations, who had the greatest appeal. Finally, the anti-imaginative bias of evangelicalism and utilitarianism was everywhere felt, especially in the first half of the century. Reading belles lettres, it was alleged, was both sinful and wasteful of time that could be put to far better advantage in "practical" pursuits. But even more numerous and stronger counter-forces were at work. One was a backwash of romanticism: the growing charm of the antique, exemplified in the bibliophily of men like Lamb, Hunt, and the elder Disraeli. The sense that books, and particularly old ones, have a magical glamor spread as the high place of imaginative and emotional experience in men's lives was reaffirmed. Closely associated with this reaction against rationalism and gritty utilitarianism was the increased importance literature acquired as a social institution. As Lionel Trilling has pointed out, literature "came to be the medium and the repository of the ethical values and the feelings that had once been peculiar to religion. And literature became even more. Carlyle, under the influence of Goethe, formulated the notion of the Man of Letters not only as a priest but as a hero and a seer and thus made him co-equal with the political leader and the rival of the scientist. In short, literature took upon itself the very greatest responsibilities and arrogated to itself the most effective powers." 4 Furthermore, as democracy slowly spread, the age-old notion that literature was the concern only of the cultural and social aristocracy faded. As early as 1819, Francis Jeffrey announced that "the fame of a poet is popular, or nothing. He does not address himself, like the man of science, to the learned, or those who desire to learn, but to all mankind; and his purpose being to delight and be praised, necessarily extends to all who can receive pleasure, or join in applause." 5 Literature of both the past and the present gradually came to be looked upon as part of the cultural heritage of all the people. As the limitations of the utilitarian philosophy became more apparent, the Victorians became uncomfortably aware that in their society humanistic values had been more and more neglected; and in an attempt to redress the balance, their journalists and public men joined to praise books as the great medium of cultural enrichment. The countless essays and speeches they composed on "The Blessedness of Books," "Little Books with Large Aims," "What a Single Book May Do for a Youth," and similar topics were part of a continuous campaign to encourage the habit of serious, profitable reading among the multitude. With opportunities for formal education severely limited, the idea of self-help was part of the Victorian creed; hence books were revered as fireside universities. Polite literature was prized not so much for its capacity to give pleasure as for its extra-literary, or non-aesthetic, values. It was through reading masterpieces of literature that the student could, for instance, enhance his understanding of history. Such an approach was used by F. D. Maurice in his lectures on English literature at King's College in the forties, 6 and by the author of the articles on literature in Cassell's influential Popular Educator . These were some of the reasons why non-contemporary English literature was constantly brought to the attention of ordinary readers, through excerpts and appreciative comment, in the pages of early mass-circulation periodicals like the Penny Magazine and Chambers's Journal . Indeed, all the way down to the era of George Newnes's Tit-Bits , some of the most popular cheap weeklies unapologetically used extracts from classic English literature as fillers. Middle-class newspapers gave generous space to reviews of current books and other literary topics. Literature was a favorite subject for the mechanics' institute lectures which had so prominent a part in middle-class cultural life in early-and mid-Victorian England. And, with the adoption of Mundella's code in 1883, elementary schools began to require pupils in the upper standards to read, parse, and memorize selected English classics. Full-length works, or substantial parts thereof, replaced the old "beauties" anthologies which for many decades had represented virtually the only chance children had to gain a glimpse of the standard classics, at least in the schoolroom. This, in brief, was the background against which the rise of the cheap classic reprint series took place. Historically, the first important inexpensive reprints, made possible by the momentous decision in Donaldson v. Beckett (1774), which killed the legal fiction of perpetual copyright, were those of John Bell, John Cooke, and James Harrison, each of whom produced two or more series devoted to out-of-copyright poets, prose writers, and dramatists. The delight they brought to impecunious book-lovers in the last quarter of the eighteenth century and the early years of the nineteenth was celebrated by Leigh Hunt, Hazlitt, Henry Kirke White, and William Hone, among others. Of Cooke in particular, Augustine Birrell wrote a century later: "You never see on a stall one of Cooke's books but it is soiled by honest usage, its odour . . . speaks of the thousand thumbs that have turned over its pages with delight. . . . He believed both in genius and his country. He gave people cheap books, and they bought them gladly." 7 Between 1790 and 1830 there was a scattering of relatively cheap series, appealing to a class of readers who could not afford the better-remembered, but higher-priced, collections of Alexander Chalmers (English Poets and British Essayists), Robert Anderson (British Poets), Robert Lynam (British Essayists), Mrs. Inchbald (British Theatre), Mrs. Barbauld (British Novelists), and Sir Walter Scott (Ballantyne's Novelist's Library). The bookseller John Sharpe brought out a long series of English poets, another of the eighteenth-century essayists, and a third of the dramatists. John Fowler Dove's miniature (24mo.) reprints of the English classics, ranging from The Compleat Angler to Pope's Poetical Works , ran to well over 100 titles. The Chiswick printer Charles Whittingham, producer of a typographically distinguished 100-volume set of the British poets for the carriage trade, served the humbler public with his Cabinet Library and Novelists Library (or, as it was also called, Whittingham's Pocket Novelists). The price range of all these series was rather wide—in the case of Whittingham's, from 2 s. to 4 s. 6 d. per volume. The cheapest series of all during this period seems to have been that of John Limbird, publisher of the 2 d. weekly Mirror of Literature , who brought out a series of British novels, with prices running from 6 d. to 3 s. 6 d. , and another of miscellaneous British classics, from 8 d. a volume upward. In addition to reprints dignified by a series title, individual cheap editions of classic authors were also issued by various publishers, nearly all of whom were despised by the genteel firms of Paternoster Row. Conspicuous among them was Thomas Tegg, the energetic scavenger of remainders and expired copyrights, whose products were memorable for their low prices, miserly format, and slovenly, not to say slashed, texts. The period 1827-32 saw the first important burst of interest in cheap books among "respectable" publishers. The appearance of Constable's Miscellany, the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge's twin Libraries of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge, Murray's Family Library, Cadell's reissue of Scott's novels at 5 s. , and Colburn and Bentley's Standard Novels touched off a virtual mania in the trade. No firm was without at least one hastily contrived "library" in its bid for the shillings of the suddenly-discovered mass reading public, whose size was now as much exaggerated as it had previously been underestimated. Cheap reprints of literary classics inevitably figured in the boom. In 1830 appeared the first volumes of the Aldine Edition of the British Poets, the result of the collaboration of the bookseller William Pickering and the printer Charles Whittingham. The most memorable classic-reprint series of the period, it held an honorable place in an increasingly competitive field down into the present century. For these reasons, it is convenient and fitting to settle upon the year 1830 as the beginning of the era when publishers developed cheap classic libraries as an integral—not merely incidental—part of their lists.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two following sections of this article are based upon a list I have compiled, from all available sources, of cheap reprint series of English classics from 1830 to 1906. At the outset, the criteria of eligibility I have used should be made clear: (1) No hard-and-fast test of "cheapness" has been adopted; but series designed chiefly for the specialist or scholar (such as the Fuller Worthies Library and W. E. Henley's Tudor Translations), or published at a price that was clearly beyond the reach of any but the well-to-do, have been omitted. (2) What is a "classic"? Since value judgments are irrelevant to our present purposes, perhaps the best definition is the one implied in the statement, attributed to the publisher Stanley Unwin, that "it takes two generations to make a classic." 8 Obviously some books become established classics even within the lifetime of their authors, as did the novels of Scott and Dickens and the poetry of Byron and Tennyson, so that the demarcation between classics and recent books of evidently lasting popularity is vague indeed. But since a line must be drawn somewhere, series composed mainly of nineteenth-century titles have been excluded, except for series late in the century, by which time works surviving from the generation of Wordsworth, Shelley, and Lamb had achieved, by any definition, the status of classic. (3) Series expressly designed for schoolroom use have been excluded. (4) Series which were virtually abortive, running to only a few titles and then vanishing, have also been omitted. The remarkable thing is that even with these severe restrictions, the list of cheap classic reprint series for the period 1830-1906 runs to between ninety and one hundred. Even if we make liberal allowance for series which appear more than once, under different names—for the bibliographer, a source of exasperation which will be commented on in a little while—the number would in any event exceed seventy-five: an average of one new classic reprint series for every year in the period covered. Some of the main cultural reasons for the proliferation of cheap classics after 1830 have already been mentioned. In addition, a powerful economic factor encouraged publishers to launch such series: the simple circumstance that most standard classics are in the public domain and therefore are cheaper to reprint than works still in copyright. As the literacy rate increased and the reading habit became more widespread, the demand for cheap books grew. For various reasons, among them the tyranny of the circulating-library system and the higher prices authors were getting for their work, books by contemporary writers were expensive and, despite the developing practice of issuing 6 s. reprints of successful works some time after first publication, they remained so until the 1890's. Thus the hunger for cheap reading matter was met, in part, by printing non-copyright works. In 1894 Augustine Birrell observed that "you may buy twenty books by dead men at the price of one work by a living man." 9 The prices charged for volumes by "dead men" more or less followed the broad tendencies in the publishing trade as a whole. Technological improvements—the use of steam-driven presses; the cheapening of paper by the introduction of paper-making machines, the substitution of esparto and chemical woodpulp for expensive rags, and the reduction and eventual repeal of the paper tax; the invention of machine-made casings to replace hand-sewed bindings—made the production of cheap books more and more rewarding. The low profit per copy was compensated for by the enlarged quantity sold. Down into the fifties and sixties, the usual price of a classic reprint was between 3 s .6 d. and 5 s. . The lower figure was that charged, for instance, for a volume in Bohn's Standard Library and British Classics (series begun in 1846 and 1853 respectively); the higher was the price of most of the other Bohn libraries, which in the aggregate comprised one of the century's two or three most famous reprint lists. Into this price range fell also the other leading series of the period—Routledge's British Poets, Bell and Daldy's reissue of the old Aldine Poets, Warne's Popular Poets and Chandos Library, Nelson's Illustrated Series of the Poets, Nimmo's Cheap Edition of the Poets, and Macmillan's Globe Library. But already, because the 3 s. 6 d. price for non-copyright reprints compared unfavorably with the shilling or two charged for "railway library" reprints of copyright works, certain firms experimented with lower prices. The highly diversified Cottage Library of Milner and Sowerby, a firm originally of Halifax but later of Paternoster Row, sold for a shilling a volume. Robert Bell's Annotated Series of the English Poets came out at 2 s. 6 d. in 1854-57 and was reissued in 1864 in monthly volumes, 1 s. in paper and 1 s. 6 d. in cloth. In the sixties Griffin's Universal Library and Warne's Chandos Classics sold at 2 s. or less. This trend toward lower prices was hastened by two spectacular free-for-alls in the reprint trade. One was occasioned by the Waverley novels, the "Author's Edition" of which, issued in 1829, had initiated the 5 s. or 6 s. copyright reprint. Cadell's "People's Edition," issued in weekly numbers (i.e., parts of volumes) in 1844, sold over 7,000,000 numbers of the novels alone, and 674,000 of the poems. After Cadell's death in 1849, his Scott copyrights were bought by the firm of A. and C. Black, who felt that there still was life left in the fabulous old property. For the "Railway Edition" in 1858-60 the price per volume was reduced to 1 s. 6 d. , and in 1862-63 it was further cut, to a straight shilling. At this point the novels began to fall out of copyright, and other firms scrambled to pick them up. One publisher, John Camden Hotten, brought out 6 d. monthly volumes, each containing a complete novel. Black responded with a competitively priced series, which had the extra attraction of Scott's own revisions and notes—material that was still in copyright. But within a few years (1873) even this sensationally low price was halved when John Dicks, a reprint publisher whose activities deserve more study than the extant records permit, brought out complete Waverley novels at 3 d. 10 There was also the episode of the shilling Shakespeares. In 1864, the year of the poet's tercentenary, John Dicks brought out the plays at two for a penny, and sold about 150,000 copies. Collecting them into a 2 s. cloth-bound volume, he sold 50,000 more. Then, hearing that Hotten was planning a complete Shakespeare to sell at 1 s. , Dicks cut the price of his own edition in half, substituting wrappers for cloth, and sold 700,000 copies in the next three or four years. For his shilling the Shakespeare lover got 1,020 pages of closely packed text and thirty-seven woodcuts. In 1868 both Routledge and Warne issued editions at the same price. 11 In the seventies, the increased demand created by the schools, further economies in production, and, we may suppose, the example of the irrepressible Dicks, who had followed up his shilling Shakespeare with a 473-page illustrated Byron at 7 d. , a Thomson at 6 d. , and about a dozen other classic authors at similar reductions, pushed prices down still further. The Aldine Poets were reissued at 1 s. 6 d. , and in response Bell's Annotated Edition was cut to 1 s. 3 d. Later in the decade the Moxon Library Poets, originally priced at 5 s. , were taken over by Ward, Lock and Co., and, renamed the Standard Poets, sold at 1 s. 6 d. in paper and 2 s. in cloth. In the eighties, houses like Routledge and Cassell, by then the titans of the reprint trade, waged an all-out price war. Routledge's Universal Library, edited by Henry Morley, began in 1883 at a shilling a volume. Two years later Cassell hired Morley to edit the firm's new National Library, issued weekly at 3 d. in paper and 6 d. in cloth. This proved the most popular classic series yet produced, and in quick retaliation Routledge brought out their World Library at the same price. The bitterness of the rivalry between these houses can be judged from a squabble they conducted in the correspondence columns of the London Times for March 20, 22, and 23, 1886. Cassell vigorously objected to Routledge's issuing, in their World Library, the same titles that had been announced for Cassell's National Library; Routledge retorted that they had been forced to do so by similar "illegitimate competition" on the part of Cassell. Morley managed to smooth the ruffled feathers of both his employers, but among other questions left unanswered was that of the ethics involved in an editor's managing two rival series at once. 12 The gradual but steady reduction in price during the second half of the century is exemplified by the fact that Sampson Low's Choice Editions of Choice Books, originally published in the late 1850's at 5 s. a volume, were reprinted in the seventies at 2 s. 6 d. , and again in the nineties at 1 s. (There was also a progressive shrinkage in size, from "small quarto" to "small octavo" to "royal 16mo.") By the end of the century, one or two shillings or a half-crown was the standard price for a full-length pocket classic bound in cloth. The enterprising W. T. Stead, to be sure, undercut even the 3 d. National and World Libraries with his Masterpiece Library (1895), composed of weekly leaflets in two series, the Penny Novelists and Penny Poets. But this venture, though initially successful, was short-lived and set no precedent. Our modern era of cheap-reprint publishing may be dated from 1906, the year with which the present study ends. It was then that J. M. Dent, who had gained experience as the publisher of the Temple Shakespeare, the Temple Dramatists, and the Temple Classics, fulfilled a long-standing ambition by issuing Everyman's Library at 1 s. a volume: not one title at a time, but fifty. The frenzied editorial and production activity and financial maneuvering necessary to issue a classic library on so grandiose a scale—a "small army" of "British Museum foragers" and introduction-writers was employed, extended credit was wheedled from papermakers—is a vividly recorded episode in British book trade history. 13 But the larger significance of the Everyman series (and in this connection, the World's Classics, begun a few years earlier by Grant Richards but soon transferred to Henry Frowde, must also receive honorable mention) is twofold: it reintroduced into reprint publishing the concern for attractive format which had been largely neglected since the days of Whittingham and the Chiswick Press, and it boldly departed from the conventionalized lists of classics, reprinting for the first time scores upon scores of good books which had never before been available in inexpensive editions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The practices adopted in producing and marketing the cheap classic series often throw interesting light upon contemporary publishing theory and book-buying habits. The "library" idea—selling a frequently miscellaneous list of books under a generic title—reflects three familiar merchandising premises, now known as "package psychology," "brand name psychology," and "snob appeal" respectively. The first assumes that when a buyer owns a few volumes in a given series (the "package"), he is likely to want to acquire the rest. The second assumes that a reader who is already pleased with one or two books belonging to such-and-such a "library" will regard the name of that series as a guarantee of excellence. The third depends on the connotation of "library," a term which in the nineteenth century was frequently preceded by "gentleman's." Possession of a shelf or two of books prominently labeled "library" gave a man a pleasant feeling of added status, however humble his actual circumstances. Closely associated with the series concept—they developed side by side in the eighteenth century—is the practice of publishing a book in instalments. From the publisher's standpoint, number- or part-issue not only has the advantages just attributed to the series but in addition, by spreading the book's cost to the purchaser over a period of time, makes it seem lower than it actually is. Many classic reprint series during the first two-thirds of the century—Cassell's various illustrated editions of literary masterpieces offer examples from the 1860's—were initially issued in weekly or monthly numbers at a few pennies each, with the completed volume becoming available immediately upon the end of the part-issue. This, of course, was exactly the procedure followed in the case of well-known Victorian novelists, from The Pickwick Papers on into the early seventies. Frequently, too, the principle of publishing at stated intervals was applied to complete volumes, without the preliminary step of issuing in several separate numbers. Thus book publishers exploited the habit of regular purchase which became increasingly prevalent as cheap periodicals won the allegiance of the mass public. If a reader was used to buying a favorite paper each Saturday, why should he not acquire the custom of buying the latest issue in a certain reprint series at the same time? This was the reasoning behind the weekly or monthly issue of series like Walter Scott's Camelot Classics and Canterbury Poets, Routledge's Universal Library, and Cassell's National Library. Like the yellow-backs that had won immense popularity a generation earlier, the classic reprint series of the nineties, priced at 3 d. , and 1 s. , used the newsagents' stalls to reach a large public that never ventured inside a regular bookshop. Then as now (at least in certain outlets) classic reprints were displayed alongside soft-bound copyright reprints and mass-circulation weeklies. In their anxiety to squeeze every possible farthing of profit from the plates and sheets of their classic titles, publishers used almost every conceivable merchandising device. Frequently an old series whose component titles had not originally appeared at regular intervals—the Aldine Poets, Bell's English Poets, and Kent's (later Cassell's) Miniature Library of Poets are cases in point—was reissued in periodic volumes, fortnightly or monthly. Sometimes, as was true of Moxon's Old Dramatists, a series previously issued in complete volumes was reintroduced in numbers. Almost every successful series was reissued, sometimes more than once, in cheaper format. Occasionally the process was reversed, and a cheap series (for instance, Bell and Daldy's Pocket Volumes) was transmuted into a more expensive one (the Elzevir Series) "so as to be more suitable for Presents and School Prizes." 14 Some series had relatively brief lives, at least in the catalogues of their original publishers. They strutted their brief moment on the stage, heralded by blaring publicity, and then were heard no more. In 1866, for example, Frederick Warne proclaimed the debut of the Clydesdale Classics, "Marvels of Standard Cheap Literature, without a parallel as yet in English Publishing"; their first number, a Pilgrim's Progress , offered eighty pages of original colored designs, new type, and fine paper—all for 6 d. "One Hundred Thousand of this elegant Pocket Edition is all that can be produced this year," Warne advertised. 15 But the supply must have exceeded the demand, for nothing more is recorded of the series. Series with longer lives often were transferred from firm to firm. Sometimes they retained their baptismal name, as did the Aldine Poets, acquired after Pickering's death in 1854 by Bell and Daldy and later inherited (1873) by their successors, George Bell and Sons. Still others suffered a name-change every time they passed to a new house, and a few appeared simultaneously, under different names, in the catalogues of two or more firms—the result of the practice, not infrequent in that era, of a "publisher-jobber [selling] other firms' sheets over his own imprint." 16 Even libraries retained by the original publisher were not exempt from rechristening whenever sales needed a boost. The firms that purveyed serial shockers to the pavement market often did the same thing when they started a fresh issue of an old favorite, and the practice is hardly extinct today, when individual soft-bound reprints sometimes bear titles different from those under which the hard-cover edition appeared. 17 Renamed series and series that led double or triple lives under the auspices of different firms are the bibliographer's despair. As he attempts to establish their provenance and history from the published records of the trade, he feels as if he were reviewing a stage army: the same lists of titles turn up again and again under different series designations. For example, unless the firm's archives were painstakingly examined, it would be an almost hopeless task to disentangle and properly label the various series of reprints which the Edinburgh house of Nimmo advertised over two or three decades. Nimmo seems to have made a specialty of buying up odds and ends; and he displayed remarkable energy and ingenuity in dressing his wares in new bindings and marshaling them under new series titles. There is a striking family resemblance between his Cheap Edition of the Poets, Red Line Editions (later retitled Popular Edition of the Works of the Poets), and Crown Library, all published in the sixties. Nimmo's Library Edition of the British Poets was a reissue of George Gilfillan's British Poets, an expensive series originally published by Nimmo's townsman, J. Nichol. In 1870 the sheets of this edition were remaindered to a third owner, Cassell, who sent them forth again in 6 d. parts as Cassell's Library Edition, and in cloth-bound volumes as Cassell's Three-and-Sixpenny Edition. 18 Or take the case of Moxon's Popular Poets, first issued about 1870 at 3 s. 6 d. , then presented in more expensive formats as Moxon's Royal Poets (7 s. 6 d. ) and Moxon's Library Poets (5 s. ) As if membership in three separate series were not enough, the collection was subsequently acquired by Ward, Lock, who reissued it in cheaper form as Ward, Lock's Standard Poets, and in turn by Collins, who converted it into the Grosvenor Poets. After coping with genealogies like these, one is grateful for the comparative simplicity of concurrent series within a single house. There is no problem, for instance, with Warne's five series of the 1860's and '70's: the Chandos Classics, which eventually extended to over 120 titles, were a cheaper edition of works printed earlier in the Chandos Library of prose writers and the Chandos Poets; and the Lansdowne and Arundel Poets were simply alternate formats, the one cheap, the other expensive, for certain titles in the Chandos Poets. In 1882 Warne published Longfellow's Poems in no fewer than four series—the Chandos Poets, the Chandos Classics, the Arundel Poets, and the Lansdowne Poets. Warne, indeed, was one of the most resourceful of all Victorian publishers when it came to getting the maximum mileage out of his stock of standard authors. In addition to the series already named, in the eighties he offered a dozen or so titles (all of them long familiar to readers of his advertisements) in the Imperial Poets, and at the same time a virtually identical list in the Albion Poets. The latter genus was divided into several species according to binding: 3 s. 6 d. cloth gilt, 5 s. imitation half-roxburghe, 7 s. 6 d. limp French morocco, 10 s. 6 d. full calf. This diversification of binding styles, either under a single series heading or under a new name for each style, was common Victorian practice. Many, if not most, series were offered in both paper and cloth, and some also were available in at least one kind of leather. In an age when middle-class taste favored highly ornate household objects, more than a few publishers regarded the printed sheets of a classic work primarily as something around which to sew or glue a pretty binding. Nimmo, for instance, devised new bindings every season; between 1870 and 1873 his Popular Edition of the Works of the Poets could be had in (among others) "Cloth Extra, Gold and Colours," "Morocco Extra, with novel prismatic effect and floral silk centre," and "entirely new cloth binding, with beautifully illuminated imitation ivory tablet on side." Elaborate bindings and lavish internal "embellishments" of course tended to remove such books from the cheap-reprint category. But even among reprints whose price was unquestionably low, the quality of physical makeup varied widely. The Aldine Poets set a high standard of typography and general design that was seldom equalled until the advent of J. M. Dent and his Temple and Everyman series. It would be hard to say which series, of the several scores published, marked the nadir of cheap book production. The 6 d. plays and novels of John Dicks would be a strong contender for the distinction, but numerous other series would be in the running. Strenuously small (and often badly worn) type; thin margins, sometimes crowded with legends advertising tea, baking powder, or patent medicines; poor paper; paper wrappers; flimsy sewing—these were too often the result of the pressure to cut prices. Whatever aesthetic satisfaction the impecunious reader derived from his purchase came from the text alone, not from the volume's appearance. Though some series were designed for parlor display and thus were of a size that would catch the eye, the majority were in small octavo or 12mo., or even as tiny as 32mo.—true "pocket books." 19 Not only were these smaller sizes, requiring less paper and binding material per volume, more economical to produce; they were best adapted to the living habits of the period. Popular books had to be portable, for an ever-increasing amount of reading was done in railway carriages and buses, and they had to be small enough to find room in the cramped households of the lower-middle and working classes, who were coming more and more to constitute the bulk of the reading audience. The day of the folio and quarto was over. The quantity and quality of text in these series varied as greatly as did the format. Some series provided complete texts of the works described on the title-page, while others provided only selections or truncated texts, a fact that was often suppressed in advertisements and on title-pages. A buyer of Spenser's "works" in one volume, for example, was not likely to acquire the whole of the Spenser canon thereby. A reprint publisher especially notorious for his cavalier handling of texts was Thomas Tegg, who, according to some of his contemporaries, included only as much of a given classic in a volume as the paper set aside for the job permitted. Tegg was scarcely unique in this respect. While they may not have been so completely lacking in concern for textual accuracy and completeness as to give rise to trade legends, most publishers were content to reprint whatever version of a masterpiece came to hand, however corrupt or fragmentary the text might be. Even if accuracy had been prized as highly in Victorian times as it is today—at least among scholars—the economics of the cheap reprinting business made careful scrutiny of the printer's copy, and subsequently of proofs, a dispensable luxury. Editorial supervision in the modern sense was rare, except in the interests of bowdlerization. Money laid out to oblige Mrs. Grundy was a thoroughly justifiable business expense. The contents of the various series, if subjected to close statistical analysis, would provide an interesting, if not always dependable, index of Victorian literary taste and of the comparative reputations of classic authors in Victorian times. The relative frequency with which various standard works were reprinted, as well as the decline in availability of certain classics and the rise of others, can be documented by studying the advertisements in the trade journals and the lists of reprints-in-series in the Reference Catalogue and Appendix B of the cumulated volumes of the English Catalogue . But one cannot assume that the reprint libraries were an unerringly faithful barometer of the literary climate, the publishers readily responding to changes in the critical and popular standings of classic authors. Practical considerations, such as the publishers' desire to get their full money's worth out of their investment in plates and stock, may well have caused certain old standbys, such as Dryden, Pope, Goldsmith, Johnson, and Cowper, to overstay their welcome. Accessibility, in short, must not be equated with popularity. The fact that Author A was represented in 75 percent of the reprint series current at a certain date, while Author B was in only 10 percent, does not prove that Author A actually stood that much higher in contemporary esteem. Thus it is quite posssible that by artificially prolonging the dominance of certain classic writers in the reprint libraries, publishers not only impeded the normal fluctuations of taste but left us a record of popular preference which is easily misinterpreted. (Future historians of a classic author's reputation in the nineteenth century, take note.) However, until much more information on the inner workings of the English book trade is available, the problem of how far the reprint publisher was responsive to public taste, and how far he influenced it, must remain a matter for speculation. The selection of titles for a classic reprint series and the preparation of introductory matter often gave employment to well-known men of letters, just as they do today. Robert Bell consulted Leigh Hunt when planning his Annotated Edition of the English Poets; it was Hunt who encouraged Bell to stray from the beaten path and include some little-known poets in his collection. 20 After Bell and Daldy acquired the Aldine Poets, they called upon men like Lord Houghton, W. M. Rossetti, Buxton Forman, and Edward Dowden to prepare new titles for the series. The individual volumes in Macmillan's Globe Edition, one of the few relatively authoritative series, were edited by men of the stature of David Masson, F. T. Palgrave, and A. W. Ward. William Michael Rossetti was the general editor of Moxon's Popular Poets during the brief period before Ward and Lock took over the series. He specifically states in his autobiography that revision or emendation of the text was not part of his job. 21 The Camelot and Canterbury series, issued by Walter Scott, a wealthy Newcastle dock and railway contractor and colliery owner who turned publisher in his late fifties, were edited in part by the self-taught collier-poet Joseph Skipsey, the novelist William Sharp, and Ernest Rhys. But perhaps the brightest galaxy of "name" editors was the one associated with Kegan Paul's Parchment Library, begun in 1880. It included Dowden, Edmund Gosse, Andrew Lang, Richard Garnett, Mark Pattison, Austin Dobson, and George Saintsbury. Until Ernest Rhys became the living symbol of Everyman's Library, the single figure most conspicuously associated with cheap classic reprints in the public mind was the critic and lecturer, Henry Morley. His son-in-law and biographer, Henry Solly, implies that his fame as editor of various reprint series somewhat embarrassed his family. "There seemed real danger," wrote Solly, "that he would be remembered after his death only in connection with his services for the diffusion of cheap literature"—a fear which proved not unfounded. 22 Punch praised him thus, in lines whose sentiment is more to be admired than their execution: John Bull is not sweet on the type of "Professor," But good Henry Morley was happy possessor Of John Bull's respect, John Bull, Junior's, love. He made Good Letters Cheap! 'Tis a title above Many Dryasdust dignities told in strung letters. Ah! many who felt Iron Fortune's stern fetters In days ante-Morleyish, look on the rows Of cheap Classics, in musical verse and sound prose, Which bear the well-known editorial "H.M.," And sigh, "If my youth-time had only known them , These threepenny treasures, and sixpenny glories, These histories, treatises, poems, and stories, Which cost in my time a small fortune, what thanks And what joys would have swelled o'er their neat-rangèd ranks!" Ah! studious boys must feel gratitude, surely, To have lived in the times of the good Henry Morley! 23 Comment in trade journals suggests that the National Library, which Morley edited for Cassell, had the greatest success of any classic-reprint series down to that time. As Solly said, "At a cost not exceeding the gas or water rate, a constant supply of good literature could be 'laid on' to any house in town or country, and a circulation varying from 50,000 to 100,000 copies for each volume attests the popular appreciation of the enterprise. Letters, which Professor Morley greatly prized, came from the far West in America, and from other lands on the borders of civilization, expressing gratitude for these cheap and handy volumes, which seemed almost as ubiquitous as Palmer's biscuits." 24</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Which raises the question, Just how influential were these reprint series in stimulating an interest in English masterpieces among the expanding reading public? In a period when cheap weeklies like the Family Herald and Tit-Bits achieved individual circulations of from 500,000 to a million, what place had older works of established literary merit in the reading diet of the multitude? One view of the matter was reported at the beginning of this article. But what were the facts? We have the boasts of certain reprint publishers, for whatever they may be worth. Of Macmillan's Globe Edition, "upwards of 140,000 volumes" were sold to the end of 1870; presumably this figure includes the sales of the first and most famous member of the series, the Shakespeare, which had found 95,000 buyers since publication in December, 1864. 25 Between the spring of 1870 and May, 1872, Moxon's sold 150,000 volumes of their Popular Poets. 26 Over a quarter-million copies of the Miniature Library of the Poets were disposed of in the period 1879-1884, according to the publishers, William Kent and Co. 27 In 1884 Warne and Co. advertised that their Chandos Classics, then numbering over 100 titles, had sold 3,500,000 volumes since publication had begun in 1868. 28 Through what seems to have been either unaccountable dereliction or heroic restraint on the part of their advertising writer, this figure remained unchanged for several years. In 1894, however, Warne revised their copy, and the total to date for the Chandos Classics was announced as six million. 29 The Canterbury Poets were reported to have sold "about a million volumes" within ten years of their beginning in 1884. 30 Ward and Lock's Minerva Library sold over 150,000 between 1889 and 1894. 31 For some years after first publication in 1894-96, the Temple Shakespeare, a forty-volume series, sold 250,000 volumes annually (and the total between 1894 and 1934 was five million). 32 Of W. T. Stead's Penny Poets, almost five million copies were published in a year, a figure exceeded by Stead's condensed Popular Novels, which were said to have sold "about six and a half million." 33 These are staggering totals indeed; but in estimating their significance, one must remember several things. One is that since most of the series mentioned included some copyright works, or at least works whose copyright had only recently lapsed, the figures are not a good indication of the current appetite for older literature. Another is that the figures are for the total sale of a whole series, which might comprise twenty, fifty, or a hundred volumes. The average sale per title would, of course, be only a fraction of the total. Unfortunately, with one or two exceptions, such as the Globe one-volume Shakespeare, sales figures for individual titles in the various series are unavailable. 33a A further consideration is that the totals often, if not always, include export sales. Of the annual total for the Temple Shakespeare, for example, 100,000 copies went to America; 34 and the Empire itself provided a large audience for books published in the British Isles. Although the books we are concerned with here were designed for the general trade, not for classroom use, they were in great demand as school prizes. And, as the advertisements also show, they were among the items most favored for family Christmas giving, or for a decorous exchange of presents between swain and sweetheart. The extent to which school prizes or sentimental gifts were actually read, let alone understood, is, however, something else again. As George Gissing observed, "Hardly will a prudent statistician venture to declare that one in every score of those who actually read sterling books do so with comprehension of their author. These dainty series of noble and delightful works, which have so seemingly wide an acceptance, think you they vouch for true appreciation in all who buy them? Remember those who purchase to follow the fashion, to impose upon their neighbor, or even to flatter themselves; think of those who wish to make cheap presents, and those who are merely pleased by the outer aspect of the volume." 35 Gissing's pessimism was widely shared throughout the Victorian period; more widely than ever at the end of the epoch, when the reading preferences of the masses had been fully expressed at public libraries and newsagents', and the verdict was overwhelmingly in favor of light novels and penny papers. "The constant flow of new editions of Great Authors," observed a writer in the Academy in 1903, "is deceptive. They are regarded as part of the necessary furniture of the house—not of the mind; and having been duly and dutifully bought they are taught to know their place on the appointed shelf. They are taken as read. . . . There are few men now who, when a new book is published, read an old one." 36 In such views — and examples could be multiplied from the annals of the nineteenth-century reading public—there is more than a hint of snobbery. The phenomenon of a semi-literate reading audience numbering in the millions stirred the residual social prejudices of the class who wrote for, and read, the leading literary journals, and it was only to be expected that they would exaggerate the situation they deplored. On the other hand, there were sturdy believers in the common man's capacity for literary culture and his active interest in acquiring it. The best-known of these was Charles Dickens, who told the Birmingham Society of Artists in 1853, "I believe there are in Birmingham at this moment many working men infinitely better versed in Shakespeare and in Milton than the average of fine gentlemen in the days of bought-and-sold dedications and dear books." 37 Every public man who had faith in mechanics' institutes and free libraries as disseminators of culture among the middle and lower classes, everyone who advocated the repeal of the newspaper tax, the amendment of the copyright law, and other schemes connected with spreading the blessings of cheap print, asserted that the multitude was ready and eager for good literature. 38 As events proved, there was just as much exaggeration on this side of the issue. The bright words of hope uttered at mid-century, when the "taxes on knowledge" and the absence of free libraries were alleged to be the only barriers to the development of a broadly cultured populace, were seldom echoed a generation later. It was indisputable that the widening of educational opportunity had not been accompanied by the same degree of literary enlightenment. In 1886 a writer in the Nineteenth Century said: "Cheap editions have brought standard works within their [the workers'] reach, and though the privilege is not largely availed of, it is not altogether neglected. . . . Lots of working men have studied with great care one or two of Shakespeare's plays; others know one or two of Dickens's works almost by heart. . . . At the same time there are working men who will devour every book they can buy or can secure from friends, and a curious undigested, if not indigestible, mass they do sometimes get hold of. Hundreds, on the other hand, have never read a line of a book." But having achieved this precarious balance on the fence, the writer continued: "The chief difficulty about literature for the working classes is to reach them. If the literature were lying on their table they would often read, but they seldom sally forth into the highways and byways of the literary world to discover what they shall purchase." 39 Since it was at this very time that paper-bound classic reprints were finding wider distribution through newsagents and other channels, one would expect to hear no more complaint that cheap reprints were difficult to obtain. Yet fifteen years later—in 1901—another writer, committed to the assumption that "hordes of men and women . . . are waiting to respond to an offer of really good and really cheap books," alleged that the trouble still lay in distribution (more specifically, the high postal rate charged for books as against the negligible cost of mailing sensational papers) and price. The solution he put forth was the issue of weekly volumes in a "General Library" subdivided into series, to be sold by subscription: 104 volumes in two years, total cost £4 in paper, £6 in cloth. 40 There was nothing really new in this proposal; but the very fact that it was reiterated defines the position of the idealist confronted with a situation in whose permanence he refuses to believe. The hard fact seemed to be that the constant activity in cheap reprint series for the past seventy years had not made the common man a devotee of great literature; no combination of merchandising devices, no amount of cheapening, had achieved that goal. But men who shared Dickens' and Sir John Herschel's and Wilkie Collins' faith in the common man's latent hunger for literary experience clung to the familiar Victorian reliance on "the proper measures." Fortunately for us, that spirit is not lost in our own time, as the many recent experiments in reprinting books of great worth in soft covers attest. However short the cheap reprint series fell of the most optimistic expectations in Victorian times, they were responsible for a wider popular interest in classic English literature than would otherwise have prevailed during the era. Concurrently with them, designed especially for students facing the various examinations for university admission and civil service posts, but undoubtedly finding an additional market beyond the crammers, were published a score or more of concise manuals, outlines, and other study-guides of English literature. Chambers's Cyclopaedia of English Literature , originally published (1842-43) in weekly numbers, and in two volumes (1844), within a few years sold 130,000 copies in England alone. 41 During the Victorian period, too, there was a revival, to which the proliferation of cheap classic reprints undoubtedly contributed, of appreciative literary journalism. In both periodicals and collected volumes, the bookish commentaries of men like Gosse, Lang, Birrell, Dowden, and Saintsbury delighted readers who, in another age, would have read Lamb, Hazlitt, and Hunt. Demand increased for popular biographies of literary figures. Macmillan's English Men of Letters series, a pioneer in its field, sold over 300,000 copies between 1878, when the first volumes, priced at 2 s. 6 d. , were published, and 1887, when a reissue in monthly volumes, at 1 s. in paper, 1 s. 6 d. in cloth, was begun. Some of the titles were reprinted from three to six times in the first ten years, while others had only a single reprinting. 42 The popularity of the various volumes evidently depended on the contemporary interest in the author treated and on the reputation of the man who wrote the biography itself. The great majority of the boys and girls and men and women into whose hands fell copies of cheap classic reprints did not leave any printed record of their pleasure. Only occasionally did the mute, inglorious common reader take pen in hand, in the manner of the Lancashire workman who wrote to Cassell's that the first twenty-three volumes of the National Library "have done a great deal of good even in my own neighbourhood, for several of my own friends have given up drinking for the sake of taking and reading your beautiful little books." 43 But a systematic combing of the memoirs of eventually well-known people who grew up in the Victorian period would reveal how many cultivated and expanded their literary taste by reading these inexpensive volumes. Thomas Hardy's first copy of Shelley was an edition of Queen Mab and Other Poems published in the Cottage Library. 44 Havelock Ellis' interest in the Elizabethan drama, which was to bear fruit in his editorship of the Mermaid series, was nurtured by his buying, as a schoolboy at Mitcham in the early 1870's, successive penny numbers of Dicks's Standard Plays. 45 Dicks's penny-number edition of Shakespeare was affectionately remembered by Thomas Burt, the Labour politician: "No matter that the print was small and the paper poor; no matter that there were neither theatre nor stage, neither actors nor orchestra. All the more scope was given to fancy and imagination." 46 Perhaps the final word may be that of the journalist Sir John Hammerton, looking back on his early days in Glasgow, about the time he left school and went to work as a correspondence clerk. In his reminiscences he exclaimed of Cassell's National Library: "What an Aladdin's cave that proved to me! Addison, Goldsmith, Bacon, Steele, DeQuincey. . . ., Charles Lamb, Macaulay and many scores of others whom old Professor Morley introduced to me—what a joy of life I obtained from these, and how greatly they made life worth living!" 47</field>

The appendix of the Marlowe volume in the Mermaid series, edited by young Have-lock Ellis, referred to certain blasphemous opinions attributed to the dramatist. The resultant uproar "in various quarters" (even Swinburne and John Addington Symonds were shocked) caused Henry Vizetelly, the publisher, to prepare a new edition in which the objectionable passages were suppressed, as well as cancels for insertion in unsold copies of the original edition. A little later, after Vizetelly's imprisonment for selling translations of Zola, and his subsequent death, the series was acquired by Fisher Unwin, who dismissed Ellis from the editorship, removed his name from the volumes, and incurred his life-long contempt.

George Dawson, a mechanics' institute lecturer, told the former committee (Qq. 1368-1375) that poetry "is a great deal read" by the working class, "and of course the result is, very much poetry is written by working people. Anybody connected with a newspaper knows what an enormous flood of poetry the working classes send in the course of a year." "The higher class of poetry," he continued, was "very much read by the working people. . . . Shakespeare is known by heart, almost," and Milton also was "much read."

      <field name="heading_text">Editing the Letters of Letter-Writers by Robert Halsband *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DURING THE LAST FEW DECADES SO MANY NEW editions of letters have been produced that any editor contemplating still another must pause and take his bearings. In the edition of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's letters which I am now preparing I hope to be guided by the virtues and warned by the faults of others before me. But if in my remarks here I raise questions which I do not answer with definite conviction, it is because my editorial resolutions are still somewhat flexible. Certainly it is easy enough to criticize nineteenth-century editors of letters. We are often impatient with their methods—their casual attitude toward accuracy of text, their skimpy and superficial annotations, their partisan attitudes, and their diligence in excising any word or passage that might bring a blush to a maiden's cheek or a blot to a family escutcheon. Perhaps we can regard them more kindly if we recall what they conceived their function to be. They intended their editions to be enjoyed by a reading public interested in genuine literature but intolerant of pedantry and dullness. These editors did not require patronage or subsidies—from either well-endowed angels or universities; they prepared their handy volumes for a reading public who bought and read. It is inconceivable, for example, that—aside from the indelicacy of publishing a living writer's complete letters—there could have been produced in the nineteenth century such a work as Professor Haight's recent seven-volume edition of the George Eliot letters. Let me say immediately that this edition is admirable as an editorial job; its only fault, reviewers have agreed, is that the letters are terribly dull. Although it is a useful work for the study of nineteenth-century literature, and will no doubt prove its value to students of George Eliot, of the novel, of literary economics, of German influence, of medical history, its warmest defenders will hardly allege that it will be read by any one whose interests are unconfined by any of these special subjects. Here, I believe, is the prime difference between letter-editing in the nineteenth century and today. In our view letters have become "documents"; and the editor, instead of presenting a literary work, is setting up an archive. The long shelves of books are no longer meant to be read but only to be referred to. Is this not corroborated by the proliferation of indexes in recent editions? Professor Haight has been temperate in allowing himself one uncomplicated index; what are we to think of Dr. Chapman's three-volume edition of Johnson's letters with its seven immense indexes? If index-learning turns no student pale, how fortunate is the student who holds the eel of science by seven tails! Our editions differ from the nineteenth century's in another related way: our tendency to "monumentalize" editions of letters, to provide—as Dr. Chapman's reviewer in the Times Literary Supplement writes— "an edition which shall be, humanly speaking, definitive and final." The sceptic may well wonder how definitive and final this edition can be when each volume has a section of addenda, and there is even a last minute inclusion in the preliminary leaves of Volume I. Our concept of definitive editions—which nineteenth-century editors did not try to produce—is perhaps related to the advertisements one sees by beauty parlors which offer permanent waves "guaranteed for three months." Our desire to make these editions all inclusive leads us to throw into them every scrap of writing by, to, and about the writer, every collateral and associated reference however remote; and so annotations grow in length and appendixes in number. Besides differing from us in their attitude toward readability and toward completeness, nineteenth-century editors necessarily reflected the genteel tone and taboos of their time. Thus in 1861 when Moy Thomas edited Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's letters he was confronted in one of her gossipy ones with a scandalous anecdote, and rather than discard it—for it makes a clever, vivid episode—he dropped it into a footnote and labeled it an excerpt from an anonymous friend's letter to her. Of course, following the editorial practice of his time, he corrected her grammar and usage like a fussy governess; and he emasculated or omitted her frank expressions and racy anecdotes. Today, fortunately, Victorian prudishness has given way to plain frankness. No word is too crude for the editors of Walpole's correspondence to transcribe or translate. The editor of Hart Crane's letters, a few years ago, published the full record of that poet's neurotic existence—only twenty years after his death. There can be no difference of opinion as to the desirability of transcription without bowdlerizing; for in an age when four-letter words unabashedly litter our fiction, and Freudian theory has passed into everyday lingo, the editor need not be a verbal or moral censor. Before discussing specific questions of text and annotation, I should like to discriminate between what we may consider the letters written by writers who are noted for their other writings and the letters by writers noted mainly for their letters. This distinction, I believe, has some bearing on the form of the edition. For the eighteenth century—which I am primarily concerned with—we may consider as letter-writers Lord Chesterfield, whose letters were last edited by Bonamy Dobrée in 1932; Horace Walpole, whose correspondence under the urbane general-editorship of Mr. Lewis has been in progress since 1937; and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, whose letters, last edited in 1861, still await complete publication. For these three writers, letters are their main claim to a place in literary history; hence they can be classified as letter-writers rather than mere writers of letters. The letter as a genre was exceptionally congenial to their talents, and they expended on it all their self-conscious, disciplined craft. In contrast, there are the mere writers of letters—Addison, edited in 1951; Steele, edited by Professor Blanchard in 1941; and Pope, whose correspondence has recently been edited by Professor Sherburn. Unquestionably these letters are important in literary history, but it is at least debatable whether they are themselves literature. To Addison and to Steele letters were a functional means of transacting business or sending messages. Addison's letters smell of the Public Record Office, where many of them indeed lie; and doesn't one become a little tired of the repetitive "Dear Prue" notes of Steele? Between these two categories—letter-writers and writers of letters—fall Thomas Gray, edited in 1935, and Johnson, edited by Dr. Chapman in 1952. Neither Gray's nor Johnson's stature comes from their letters alone, but it is raised by them. Gray's scintillate with the lively intimacy repressed in his external life; and Johnson's display the drama of a combative many-sided personality. Many readers, no doubt, go to these letters not for any particular fact but for the enjoyment of reading. And now to the editor's problems—to his "job of work." He must first decide what to include in his edition. This problem is, today, less obvious than it would seem. All of us agree that every letter by the writer should be included, whether it survives in manuscript or only in a printed copy. The headaches that afflict editors of printed works in deciding on a correct copy-text are spared the letter editor: the manuscript has prime authority, and where it does not survive, then the printed text closest to it. In printing every letter, the editor may have to welcome brief and inconsequential notes. It is Robert Browning's recent editor, I believe, who was confronted by scores of postal cards on which the poet had merely accepted or declined dinner invitations. Fortunately eighteenth-century letter-writers did not bother to write letters unless they had something to say in them. Johnson remarked to an old friend, "I find myself very unwilling to take up a pen only to tell my friends that I am well." And where only brief notes survive, they are valuable for filling in sparsely documented biography. If most editors print all the letters by their writers, there is some disagreement in the matter of printing letters to or even about them. Professor Haight calls his edition The George Eliot Letters , yet only two-thirds of the letters come from her pen. The editions of Gray and of Walpole, called correspondences, print letters to and from these writers; so does Professor Sherburn, although since he also prints letters by Pope's friends to each other, his edition may be called "Pope and His Circle." A more extreme example of this tendency is Theodore Besterman's edition of Voltaire's correspondence, now in progress; and that collection, one may observe, is not so much an edition of letters as a collection of materials toward Voltaire's biography. The practice of giving both sides of a correspondence—as we see in the Walpole edition—has obvious advantages; it also has the disadvantage of swelling the volumes with a great mass of material which is dull and only of oblique literary interest. Horace Mann's letters to Walpole illustrate this; and his editors even print the long official documents which Mann occasionally enclosed. If this correspondence is intended to be a political history of the eighteenth century, the plan is sound; but it is difficult to see its literary justification. Mr. Lewis admits as much, when he writes (in Collector's Progress ), "From the first the Yale Walpole has been planned as an encyclopedia of eighteenth century life and thought." Any decision as to what to print rests ultimately on two factors: what is the edition's purpose and what materials are available. If I may discuss, for the moment, my own concern with Lady Mary's letters, this is how it works out: I wish to present, essentially, her own writings—not because they are a source of historical, literary, social, or biographical information, but because they have value as literature. (I need not take time now to say why they can be considered so; we can accept the sanction of critical opinion since her own time.) In round numbers I have about 800 letters written by Lady Mary, more than twice the number printed by her last editor. Of these 800, about 650 survive in manuscript—which will give my text a solid and reliable basis. What of the surviving letters written to her? Should they be printed in the text? I have about 90 from her husband, and about 60 drafts of letters sent to her by the Countess of Oxford. These two series are so dry and dull that they would, if printed, infect the book with a deadly tedium. I plan instead to quote from them, only where relevant, in my annotations. Lady Mary's correspondence with Pope presents a different problem. There are about 20 of his letters to her; and although they illustrate Pope's inflamed imagination and one of his epistolary styles, they tell us very little about Lady Mary's lost letters to him. Since Professor Sherburn has carefully printed from manuscript this series of letters from Pope, there is no point in my duplicating the text. The only surviving letters from Lady Mary to Pope are two very brief notes sent after his effusive friendship and correspondence had abated. These two will appear in my text, in accordance with my rule that all of her letters deserve a place there. Her correspondence with Lord Hervey raises still a different problem. For over twenty years they maintained a lively friendship, usually sympathetic but sometimes malicious. (Lady Mary is responsible for the epigram that there are three sexes: men, women, and Herveys.) After his death his son courteously sealed up all of Lady Mary's letters and returned them to her. Not a single one has come down to us. But of Hervey's letters to her, I have his manuscript copies of 43 which have never been printed. Many of them are direct replies to those she sent him, and so they tell us something of her lost letters; they are, besides, of great interest in their own right, displaying the copious talent and skill that make his Memoirs of the Reign of George II such a brilliant document. I plan to print them as part of my text; or, if I lose heart at thus flouting my own rule, I can assign them to an appendix. Having decided, in general, that only Lady Mary's own letters belong in the text, and that those to her belong in the annotations, I must next decide how to arrange them: in a single chronological sequence or in separate correspondences. Mr. Lewis's edition of Walpole and the Nichol Smith-Cleanth Brooks edition of Bishop Percy's letters follow the latter arrangement. Mr. Lewis's defense of it for his edition seems to me persuasive for two special reasons: that both sides of the Walpole correspondences are very fully printed, and that Walpole channeled his four main interests among particular friends—so that each series has an inherent unity. But editors of both letter-writers and writers of letters generally prefer the single sequence. The fascination of reading these collections comes from seeing the gradual unfolding of their writers' lives and ideas, as well as their coherent comments on topics which caught their interest. If editors agree on the arrangement of their letters, they diverge sharply in the matter of how to present their texts. The root of the divergence is the fact that the copy-text is a manuscript. The editor must decide, essentially, whether he wishes to put the letter into the reader's hands as a manuscript or as a printed text. Dr. Chapman writes in his introduction: "I have aimed at reproducing my manuscripts as closely as typography admits." But does he? I notice, for example, that he does not reproduce Johnson's long s. I believe, perhaps naïvely, that the exact reproduction of a manuscript is impossible. Even if we used a photo-process, we should then begin to worry about the color of the ink, the quality of the paper, the manner of folding the sheet, and so on. When we decide to reproduce it by means of typography, we have made a great concession; and once having made it we need not be stingy as to its extent. No reader of the book will be fooled into thinking he has a manuscript in his hand. Dr. Chapman, of course, is neither the innovator of this point of view, nor even its most extreme champion. The Toynbee-Whibley edition of Gray prints long s 's, abbreviations, and raised letters; it is fussy and finicky about every detail of the manuscript. It does not indent, so that we sometimes come up against a tight-packed, full page of dense type without a crack in the text to allow us a breath. As a reference work this edition is excellent, but who reads it? At the other extreme of textual style—that of normalizing—stand the newest editions of Walpole and Chesterfield. Mr. Lewis's practice is to retain Walpole's spelling of proper names and (careful) punctuation, but to normalize other spellings and capitalization. Professor Dobrée also normalizes spelling and capitalization. His object, he writes in his preface, has been "to make the text as pleasurable as possible to the reader of today, while altering as little as possible." As a general principle this makes good sense. It seems paradoxical that political and social historians—who, one would think, are sticklers for exactness—should prefer normalized texts, whereas literary historians strive for exact transcription. I can only conjecture why this is so: the former group want the letters set forth as factually exact as possible but without any distracting irrelevances because to them the facts are paramount; literary historians believe that they will lose the nuances of style if the text is normalized, and that these small details convey the flavor of the writer's personality and milieu. Between these extremes there are other sensible styles. Nichol Smith writes in his edition of the Burnet-Ducket letters: "It has been found desirable to expand the simpler contractions and to add occasionally to the punctuation"; but in his Swift-Ford letters (twenty-one years later), although he expands contractions he retains raised letters for titles—a confusing procedure when footnote numerals are also raised. (One would think a title like Lord or Duchess simple enough to expand.) Professor Tinker in his 1924 edition of Boswell's letters has normalized except for spelling; and it is only necessary to glance at his page to see how much is gained and how little lost. What kind of text—to come to my own job—do I plan to use for Lady Mary's letters? I am fairly certain that I do not want a facsimile manuscript reproduction. Nor do I want the letters to look as though they had appeared in this morning's Times . My solution, a compromise, comes from these factors: that the edition will be published by a university press, and so must be scholarly and reasonably complete; that as a great letter-writer Lady Mary will attract readers beyond the ranks of eighteenth-century students and scholars; and that her letters, as manuscripts, raise several peculiar problems. I have therefore decided on the following style. I shall reproduce her exact spelling and capitalization. The range of her spelling—extending over more than fifty years of her activity as a letter-writer—illustrates the gradual evolution of her writing from that of a girl haphazardly and self-educated to that of a poised woman of letters. Her spelling of family and place names is historically useful. Her use of capitals for nouns, though unsystematic, was often her way of achieving emphasis. These differences (in spelling and capitalization) from twentieth-century norms do not impede the reader, for he finds them in the printed texts of the eighteenth century. In regard to capitalization, Mr. Lewis states that it is often not possible to be sure when the writer intended a capital; but an editor, who is presumably best qualified to read the manuscript, is least likely to make this error in transcription. With all abbreviations (including the ampersand) and with raised letters I intend to be pitiless: the contractions and abbreviations will be expanded in full, and the raised letters lowered to the plane where they belong. (Proper names will be expanded within square brackets.) These niceties are of no more importance, it seems to me, than an extra flourish of the pen or the placing of a date on the left or right hand side of the manuscript page. It may be objected that abbreviations are significant in showing the degree of familiarity or of formality in a letter, for letter-writers tended to avoid abbreviations in their formal notes. But surely we judge the tone of a letter by its actual words and ideas and not by its flourishes and shorthand. As the reader picks his way through stenographic symbols like D s for Duchess or y m for them , he may forget the thought. Even Dr. Chapman, so faithful to his manuscripts, does not reproduce Johnson's "displayed" conclusions because he believes they would waste space and offend the eye. Professor Sherburn, with more precision, uses vertical lines (as in the bibliographical description of title pages) to set forth the conclusions of Pope's letters; but it is difficult to see any advantage beyond mere exactness. Nor do I see any benefit in indicating the pages of the manuscript letter, as the editors of Percy's letters do by printing marginal glosses. As a result their page is disfigured, and the reader is burdened with useless information about the physical condition of the manuscript. How should the editor treat the writer's erasures (assuming he can read them) and inadvertent errors like repeated or omitted small words and syllables? Dr. Chapman neglects Johnson's erasures but preserves his inadvertences "partly because they furnish some indication of his state of health or his state of mind, partly because they show the sort of error to which he was prone. . . ." As good or even a better case can be made for preserving the one and neglecting the other; for the erasures show us the writer's literal intention, whereas his inadvertences provide an incalculable number of speculative possibilities. When Johnson repeats a syllable in carrying a divided word over to a new page, what does that signify? Perhaps merely that a fly alighted on his nose and distracted his attention. For both types of lapses the editor need not set himself any rigid rules. In many instances he can avail himself of square brackets to insert what the reader does need, and common sense to omit what the reader clearly does not. My most radical treatment of the text is this: I shall add punctuation where the sense demands it, and I shall capitalize the first word of every sentence. Lady Mary's custom in these two respects is rather cavalier; its exact reproduction would be meaningless. I have noticed that when I read a text exactly reproduced from manuscript, a sentence ending without a period or a sentence beginning with a lower-case letter stops me in my tracks, and my eye swings forward and back to catch hold of the sense. Careful analysis of the clauses usually determines the sentence sense; and if the editor does this first, then the reader can read without interruption. The exact typographical copy of a manuscript has this ironic effect (as Mr. Lewis shrewdly remarks); it "imparts an air of quaintness to a text which was not apparent to the correspondents themselves." For their letters printed in their own day do not challenge the modern eye, as we can see in any eighteenth-century collection. The text-style I have chosen, then, is a compromise, but I believe a sensible one—something between eighteenth-century printed and manuscript styles and at the same time hospitable to the modern reader. So much for my text. These matters of spelling, capitalization, abbreviations, and punctuation are relatively trivial compared to the fact that every word written by Lady Mary in her letters will be clearly reproduced. A manuscript letter contains more than simply the writer's message; and the editor must decide how to deal with this other material. The recipient's name and the date of the letter, although they may not appear on the letter (and are hence editorial intrusions) are obviously a necessary adjunct to the letter if it is to be intelligible. The postmark, if any, should be recorded, for it is evidence that the letter was actually sent, and may have some bearing on the letter's date of composition and of transmission. But I see no reason why it should be with the text when it can be dropped into a footnote. The endorsement, since it is also part of the letter, should also appear on the page—under the text, if by the writer; as a footnote, if by the recipient. Most of Lady Mary's letters to her husband were endorsed by him with a date and a summary of their contents, and this information is often clarifying. Does the editor have to record which passages in a letter have been struck out by the recipient or subsequent owners of the manuscript? Here his own judgment takes precedence over definite rules. Of course he will always decipher and print the passages. Any mutilation of the manuscript likely to mislead a later user can be noted at the foot of the page. This editorial problem does not exist in Lady Mary's letters, for her heirs, instead of using scissors or india ink, more effectively censored the letters which they disapproved of by burning them. Fanny Burney censored her father's letters, Mr. James Osborn tells us; there is good literary justification for an editor's noting her editorial treatment. The recent owners of Boswell's manuscripts censored before selling; and to record their attempts at suppression may illustrate Victorian prudery, but nothing is thus added to Boswell's letters. Mr. Lewis's edition of Walpole points out what has been omitted in previous printed editions. Although this unwittingly focusses the reader's attention on the scandalous and off-color anecdotes, it adds nothing to the letters. Any reader interested in what earlier editions have omitted can simply collate the printed texts. With a manuscript letter in his hand the editor can disregard a previously printed copy. But if he cannot find the manuscript and must depend on a printed text, he must be grateful—and very cautious. In my own work on Lady Mary's letters I have had a variety of illuminating experiences. Moy Thomas printed a letter from Lady Mary to her daughter, but he could not find the original among the Wortley Manuscripts, and so he took his text from Dallaway, Lady Mary's first acknowledged editor (in 1803). The letter contains an elaborate anecdote about William Pitt's ministry, and Thomas footnotes it thus: "It is remarkable that Lady Mary herself appears to have appropriated the passage from a letter of her friend, Miss Tichborne"; and he then quotes the identical passage from the friend's (manuscript) letter. But the truth of the matter is that Lady Mary's letter—which exists among the Wortley Manuscripts, though Thomas could not find it—does not contain the anecdote. Dallaway had simply transferred it from the friend's to Lady Mary's letter. Thomas should have been on guard, particularly since in his preface he accuses Dallaway of flagrant tampering. Of greater importance than this kind of conflation—which an editor can discover by carefully checking his manuscripts—are those letters which exist only in printed form and without clear authority. The editor of Lady Mary's letters must deal with this situation: her Embassy Letters were published posthumously and without her family's permission, but their authenticity is beyond doubt since her own manuscript still exists. Four years later the same publisher issued an Additional Volume containing six letters, of which one had been published long before (in 1719). The other five, I do not doubt, are spurious, yet they have since then been printed among Lady Mary's letters. Moy Thomas put them in his text, labeled as of doubtful authenticity, but that has not prevented careless literary historians and anthologists from using them as examples of Lady Mary's epistolary art. How shall I treat them in my edition? Probably consign them to the purgatory of an appendix. What of each letter's provenience as a manuscript and its bibliographical history? Most modern editors put these facts at the head of the letters. I believe that this information, although interesting and perhaps important, is primarily antiquarian; and so instead of cluttering the text to the reader's distraction, it can be neatly dropped into the footnotes. Having set up the text of his letters the editor must then wrestle with his annotations. In this bout he will find even less agreement than in textual style. "It is impossible," wrote Dr. Johnson, "for an expositor not to write too little for some, and too much for others." Mr. Lewis's Walpole annotations are considered by many to err on the side of generosity; and in England one hears quips about the full genealogies attached to everyone mentioned in the text. This tendency to annotate Walpole widely and deeply has become more pronounced in the Mann correspondence, so that the volumes are becoming not a source for political history but a veritable reference collection. Whether or not one agrees with this objection, there can be no doubt as to the balance, tact, and efficient accuracy of these annotations. Although the editor may set up formulas to determine what requires elucidation, he must actually judge each instance individually. When Lady Mary writes of Gulliver's Travels : ". . . and very wonderful it is, God knows!" should the reader be referred to the Bible passim or to Sir Harold Williams' bibliographical study? But if she refers to an obscure politician, the reader should be told his identity and referred to the DNB . If you will recall my initial premise—that the reader wishes to read the letters—then the annotations must remain subservient. They must not be tantalizingly brief lest they generate their own puzzles. Nor should the editor disregard a name or quotation or allusion in a letter because—he may rationalize—his main job was to present the text. It would be easy, but not really necessary, to quote examples of faulty annotations. Let me instead give a couple of samples of how I intend to deal with this. In a letter from Avignon, Lady Mary writes to Lady Oxford in October 1744 that she supposes the slowness of the mails is "occasioned by the cessation of correspondence between Dover and Calais." My footnote reads: "War between England and France had broken out on 15 March 1744." Merely that. It is not necessary to give the causes or battles of the war, the organization of the post office, or a survey of postal routes in 1744. In the same letter Lady Mary sends her opinion of Pope's will; and in my footnote I quote the few sentences from Lady Oxford's letter which had told Lady Mary the news. I doubt that more is required, for this is not a biography of Pope or a study of his reputation; it is a letter by Lady Mary. Should passages in foreign languages be translated in the footnotes? Most editors have conceded that the reader of even scholarly editions needs to have Latin translated for him. (Professor Sherburn's edition of Pope does not make this concession.) The relatively few Latin quotations in Lady Mary's letters will be translated in the footnotes. And like all these other editors I do not intend to translate French passages. To the reader unfamiliar with that language, about twenty newly discovered letters in French by Lady Mary will have to remain buried in the obscurity of a modern language. I hope Dr. Chapman's extensive use of abbreviations in his letterheads and footnotes does not win many imitators. (So far, Miss Norton, in her edition of Gibbon's letters, has imitated.) The reader must fight his way through an alphabetical thicket, for he is forced to expand initials into names so frequently that reading gives way to mnemonics. The elaboration of short cuts can reach a point of diminishing returns. I also confess myself irritated by Dr. Chapman's abbreviated year dates —'74 for 1774. Only one space is saved, and again the reader's attention is distracted by having to fill in what has been omitted. The editor's job, after all, is to remove obstacles, not to create new ones. For my own abbreviations: since I have such mouth- and line-filling names for Lady Mary and for her husband, I designate them as M and as W. But there I draw the line. Where sensible and useful, the editor can use short cuts. The letters, for example, can be assigned numbers, and these can then be used for cross references. If the letter-numbers are printed as shoulder-notes on each page, they can easily be found by the reader. The freedom and elasticity of footnotes are a great temptation to a vivacious editor. He can fill them with materials for his autobiography as a scholar, telling us how and where he has searched, whom solicited, why failed, when succeeded, and so on. His acknowledgments belong in the prefatory material; after page one the reader is concerned not with the editor but with the letter-writer. A simple rule for avoiding editorial exhibitionism is to avoid the first person pronoun. Besides cozy footnote chats, the editor will be tempted into sly quips and oblique jokes; and this should also be resisted. The editor, in short, should practise the most extreme self-effacement in favor of the letter-writer. I hope I do not seem to be in favor of erasing the editor. I wish, on the contrary, to restore to him the function stated in Dr. Johnson's definition: "he that revises or prepares any work for publication." The editor, as I see him, should be discriminating as to what goes into the edition and also as to what belongs in the text and in the annotations. He should prepare his text in such a way as to make it faithful to his manuscript and at the same time serviceable to his readers; he should arrange his annotations and apparatus in a simple, lucid form. Earlier in this paper I made a distinction between letter-writers and writers of letters. Perhaps this gap can be narrowed if we print more letters as though they were worth reading for their own sake. Unless we print letters in such a form as to allow them to be read as widely as possible and with ease and pleasure we are in danger of creating a coterie scholarship, when we will only read each other's footnotes; and the ranks of monumental editions will, in truth, be only monuments. If I seem reactionary in advocating a return to the nineteenth-century concept of readable editions, I hope it is still progress—on a spiral, so to speak; for we can also make our texts accurate and our annotations full and scholarly. Is this possible? you may well ask. I hold here the first volume of the new edition, in the Pléiade series, of Madame de Sévigné's letters. In several respects it is more radical than I have outlined: the notes, of exemplary brevity and directness, are in the back of the volume, and the spelling, punctuation, and capitalization are normalized. (The text is for the most part based not on the writer's own manuscripts, which do not survive, but on a later transcript.) While it is both scholarly and complete, it is at the same time attractively made and invitingly readable. "Mon cousin," she once wrote to Bussy-Rabutin, "s'il vous prend fantaisie un jour de publier mes lettres, je vous prie de les corriger." He answered, "Ma cousine, on ne corrige pas le Titien." (But he did.) If today we do not believe in correcting our Titians, we as editors should at least clean, frame, and light them for all to see and enjoy.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Setting By Formes in Quarto Printing by George Walton Williams *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT HAS GENERALLY BEEN ASSUMED AS "VIRTUALLY axiomatic" that the pages of hand-set books of the sixteenth century were composed in seriatim order in first editions. 1 Moxon had suggested to be sure that casting-off manuscript copy and setting by formes were possibilities, but his tone intimated that the phenomenon was both troublesome and of infrequent occurrence. 2 Dr. William Bond in 1948 advanced the tentative hypothesis based on line-counts that setting by formes did occur in sixteenth-century quartos and octavos. 3 More recently Dr. Charlton Hinman has irrefutably demonstrated that the Shakespeare First Folio was regularly set by formes. 4 In this paper I shall argue that setting by formes in quarto printing was a more common occurrence than has been thought. The evidence for this theory is derived from the sufficiency and deficiency of particular characters from a given font in a given text. It is based on two observations: (1) the count of type-pieces of a character as they appear in a sheet or a forme, and (2) the presence of substitutions for the character which indicate that the supply of the character has been exhausted in the course of the work. A few difficulties must be admitted and a few cautions mentioned at the outset. Not all substitutions point perforce to the exhaustion of the proper character, and insignificant substitutions must be distinguished from significant ones. Studies of type shortage should depend on prior compositorial analysis. Differences in compositors or differences in their cases can obscure or invalidate the results of any findings. Often the evidence is not really comprehensible; presumably the human element has intervened. Occasionally the compositor, knowing that he would run short of a character, seems to have saved his characters for use in prominent locations, mixed his proper and his improper sorts indiscriminately, or distributed his wrought-off pages in an unpredictable time sequence. Some substitutions may have been used to assist in justifying lines without regard to the supply or shortage of the proper character. Difficulties also exist in tracing shortages through the successive sheets of a quarto; characters in demand in one sheet are often not needed in another so that a continuing pattern is not attainable. But in spite of all these difficulties, the method is serviceable in some cases, as the following examples will make clear. Those presented first were all set from the same font of type by the same compositor working in the shop of Thomas Creede between 1593 and 1599. 5 The first example of this investigation is found in the Epicedium: A Funeral Song upon the Death of the Lady Helen Branch (STC 12751), printed by Creede in 1594, one of the first works to be issued from his newly established shop. The Epicedium is a single-sheet quarto comprising 144 lines of verse, printed in roman type of a size approximating to modern pica (20 ll. 84 mm.). This particular font of type was apparently not supplied with the characters for lowercase and upper-case 'w' in sufficient quantity for this particular job, and the supplies of those characters were exhausted during the setting of the sheet. The place of the lower-case character was then filled with 'vv', and the place of the upper-case character with 'VV' — substitutions common enough in the period. The following table lists the incidence of 'w', 'vv' and 'W', 'VV' in the sheet: A1 A1 v A2 A2 v A3 A3 v A4 A4 v Total w - 20 19 3 26 15 - 83 vv 1 - 30 31 -- 114 W - - 8 4 3 4 2 - 21 VV 2 2 -- 23 The lower-case character was required 114 times in the sheet. On 83 instances the 'w' was set in the proper fashion, but on 31 instances on pages A1 and A3 the substitute 'vv' was used in its place. The upper-case character was required 23 times in the sheet. On 21 instances the 'W' was set in the proper fashion, but on two instances on page A3 the substitute 'VV' was used in its place. I have suggested that before drawing any conclusions from the appearance and disappearance of a character, we must be aware of the compositorial situation before us. But in any given problem we must also be satisfied as to the reactions of the compositor in one particular. In this example we must know the compositor's attitude toward 'w' and 'vv'. On signature A3 where both forms of both characters occur, the dividing lines between the proper and the substitute forms are distinct; the proper forms appear at the top of the page and the substitute forms follow them. 6 We may reasonably infer from this fact that the compositor was not indifferent to the w/vv distinction. He obviously used the proper character until he had no more. We may have some confidence, then, in believing that when this compositor set the upper- or lower-case 'vv' form, he did so because his supply of the proper sort was exhausted, and we may conclude that in the Epicedium the substitution is significant. 7 It seems reasonable to suppose that the compositor began his type-setting with a supply of the 'w' character in his cases. It follows then if the compositor was careful in this matter — and we have just seen that he was — that the sufficiency of the character should appear at the beginning of the work and the shortage of the character and its substitution at the end of the work. From the evidence of the shortage of 'w' and 'W', we may conclude that pages A2, A2 v , A3 v , and A4, which exhibit a sufficient supply of the character were composed before pages A3 and A1, which by the use of the substitution exhibit an insufficient supply. An order of setting in which A3 v and A4 precede A3 and A1 is comprehensible only if we assume that the compositor was setting by formes, the inner forme preceding the outer: A1 v A2 A3 v A4 A2 v A3 A4 v A1 w - 20 26 15 19 3 vv 30 - 1 W - 8 4 2 4 3 VV 2 - - This rearrangement by formes reveals a sufficiency of the 'w' and 'W' characters for all the pages of the inner forme, A1 v (a blank), A2, A3 v , and A4 — and for the first page of the outer forme, A2 v . Three more 'w' forms and three more 'W' forms appear in the upper section of A3, but the substitutions for these characters occur throughout the rest of the page. The 'vv' substitution found on the title page, A1, argues that that page was set last in the forme (not unnaturally). Page A4 v is a blank. The outer forme thus displays the shortage of 'w' in two of its pages and must therefore have been set after the inner. Two objections to the theory of setting by formes for this quarto come at once to mind: the possibility of a distribution of type after page A3, and the difficulty of casting-off copy so as to set pages out of normal consecutive order. As to the first, a distribution of type in the midst of a work as small as the Epicedium would have been improbable. 8 Furthermore, such an argument cannot logically explain the presence of the 'vv' on the title page. As to the difficulty of casting-off copy, there is none. The verse is in twelve-line stanzas which are set three to a page. There could have been no difficulty in counting off the number of stanzas and setting them out of their seriatim order. Neither of these objections is of any genuine concern in the present example, and we may safely conclude on the basis of the evidence of type shortage in the pages of the outer forme that the quarto was set by formes, the inner preceding and the outer succeeding. Another work printed by Creede which made heavy demands on this font was The First Part of the Contention betwixt the Two Famous Houses of Yorke and Lancaster (STC 26099), issued in 1594. In this quarto shortages occur frequently. Most conspicuous is the shortage of lower-case 'w', though there seems for this play to have been a sufficiency of the upper-case 'W'. Shortages in the associated italic font are also evident, but they seem to present no clear pattern. Random mixing of roman and italic forms of 'k', 'K', 'S', and 'Q' and the substitutions of ' VV ' and 'W' for the proper ' W ' (of which only three pieces seem to exist) are common in the quarto and are without significance. The shortage of lower-case 'w', on the other hand, discloses a pattern throughout the quarto. An ample supply of the character was available for most of the pages of sheet A: A1 v 2 2 v 3 3 v 4 4 v 1 w - 8 19 17 25 35 vv 2 23 1 Pages A2, A2 v , A3, and A3 v were set with the proper character; on A4 the supply was exhausted at the bottom of the page, and A4 v was set with the 'vv' substitution entirely. The division between the 'w' and the 'vv' forms is a clean one, the 'w' forms appearing at the top of the page, the 'vv' forms at the bottom. Such a pattern argues here for seriatim composition of sheet A beginning with A2 (A1 v blank). At the same time the evidence of the single 'vv' on A1, the title page, suggests that that page was composed last, after A4 v (as in the Epicedium ). 9 A seriatim arrangement for the pages of sheet B produces what would seem to be two distinct and contradictory instances of font depletion in adjoining pages, B3 and B3 v . The arrangement by formes (the outer first) 10 offers a solution to the contradiction. B1 1 v 2 2 v 3 3 v 4 4 v B1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 w 23 21 29 24 15 25 28 23 24 15 28 21 29 25 vv 6 10 16 6 10 16 This rearrangement suggests that after the composition of B3 the type used in earlier press-work was distributed and the cases were restocked. Once more the divisions of 'w' and 'vv' on the two pages, B3 and B3 v , on which both forms appear are clear-cut and distinct. 11 Corroborating evidence for a distribution after B3 and for the font depletion on B4 exists in the appearance of substitutions for 'W' and for 'I'. Near the bottom of B3, just one line above the first of the 'vv' substitutions, occurs the unique example of 'VV' in the quarto. It indicates that the supply of 'W' — like the supply of 'w' — has been exhausted at that point. Similarly at the bottom of B4 occur eight italic ' I ' substitutions for the correct roman 'I'. Since they occur in the last appearances of the character in the forme, they indicate that the font has been depleted and that the supply of the proper roman character has been exhausted. Sheet C is likewise more regularly arranged by formes, the outer preceding. This rearrangement is based more on the relationship of the type-pieces in this sheet to adjoining sheets than on the equivocal evidence of the type shortage within the sheet. C1 1 v 2 2 v 3 3 v 4 4 v C1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 w 22 34 31 19 24 19 1 26 22 19 24 26 34 31 19 1 vv 5 24 5 24 Sheet C exhibits the shortage of 'w' in signatures 3 v and 4, the last pages of the sheet to be composed. Sheets D and E exhibit the shortages in 4 v . Hence we may conclude that 4 v was the last page to be composed in sheets D and E and that the composition of these sheets was therefore probably seriatim. This conjecture involves certain assumptions, chief among which is this that the compositor was well in advance of his press at the beginning of sheet D. That this assumption is correct and that the compositor was not only ahead but was gaining on his press are indicated by the evidence for the distribution of type and the restocking of the cases. Thus it would seem that one forme was distributed and the supply of 'w' replenished before E1 was set (after depletion on D4 v ), one forme was distributed before F1 v was set (after depletion on F1), and one forme was distributed before G2 was set (after depletion on G1 v ). The progression from one to one-verso to two suggests that the compositor was able to set the sheets of this quarto faster than his press could print them, for the delivery and the distribution of the wrought-off forme come increasingly later in the composition period. D1 1 v 2 2 v 3 3 v 4 4 v E1 1 v 2 2 v 3 3 v 4 4 v w 18 13 30 27 17 23 16 15 30 25 25 24 33 33 19 20 vv 13 4 F1 1 v 2 2 v 3 3 v 4 4 v G1 1 v 2 2 v 3 3 v 4 4 v w 23 17 17 29 29 20 26 24 13 27 26 28 25 32 9 vv 31 15 14 H1 1 v 2 2 v 3 3 v 4 4 v w 5 24 19 32 21 1 6 - vv 18 6 w 13 Sheet H presents two difficulties in interpreting the w/vv pattern. The appearance of five 'w' forms on sig. H1 is not readily explicable. The pattern of deficiency and sufficiency for H3 v is unique in the quarto. The page begins with a single 'w' form; this is followed by six 'vv' forms; and these by thirteen 'w' forms. It is arguable that the supply of 'w' was exhausted at the top of the page and that the compositor then turned to his substitution ('vv') for six settings. At this moment the type of a forme released by the press was distributed, and the cases were restocked. The compositor was thus able to finish sheet H with the proper 'w' character as he had begun it. The fresh supplies of 'w' available for pages B1, B4 v , C1, D1, E1, F1 v , and G2 testify to a distribution of an earlier forme at the beginnings of these pages. The appearance of eight substitutions of ' I ' for 'I' at the bottom of B4 and of two at the bottom of F1, and the resumption of the proper form on C1 and F1 v respectively, confirm the fact that the font was depleted at those points. 12 The appearance of six substitutions of ' A ' for 'A' in the middle of D2 v suggests an exhaustion and a restocking on that page. 13 Distribution after: A1 B3 B4 C4 v C4 D2 v D4 v E3 F1 F3 G1 v G3 G4 v H1 H3 v Pieces utilized between points of distribution: 62 103 91 85 77 82 137 72 86 112 81 66 5 97 19 Pieces released by distribution of forme 62 68 36 90 75 91 85 77 82 107 102 72 89 87 Ai Ao Bo Bi Co Ci Do Di Eo Ei Fo Fi Go Increment: 35 50 50 (Argument for distribution after C4 v , E3, F3, G3 is hypothetical; argument for distribution on D2 v is based on shortage of 'A'. Argument for distribution after all other pages is based on shortage of 'w', confirmed for B3 and F1 by shortage of 'I'. Distribution occurs in the middle of D2 v and H3 v , not after those pages.) The preceding table indicates a high degree of correlation between the number of pieces released and the number of pieces utilized. Thus between pages E3 and F1, 72 'w' pieces are used; these are supplied by the distribution of D outer — containing 77 pieces — at the end of E3. Between G3 and G4 v , 66 pieces are used; these are supplied by the distribution of F outer yielding 72 pieces. Sheets A and B derive their supply from initially full cases and from distribution of earlier press-work. Sheets C and E made extraordinary demands on the font. The fact that the shortages of 'w' do not appear in the earlier pages of these two sheets indicates that some extra pieces of the sort must have been added to the font during the composition of both sheets. 14 The analysis of the shortage of 'w' in the Contention has presented an hypothesis for the order of the pages in the sheets and for the formes in the press. The appearance of a pattern of generally predictable depletion and distribution of the 'w' character in the play corroborates an argument for a single set of cases and for a single compositor and allows a conjecture as to the speed and the facility of the compositor. The Menechmi (STC 20002), printed by Creede in 1595, offers an informative example of the compositor's solution to another problem of deficiency of type, this time in the italic font associated with the roman font under discussion. This English translation of the Plautine comedy exhibits a shortage of italic capital ' M '. This shortage is not occasioned by normal demands of the text on an inadequate font; rather is it the result of abnormal demands of the text on an adequate font. It is this compositor's practice to set speech prefixes and proper names in the text in italic, and as the play includes the characters of the Menechmi, Messenio, Mulier, and Medicus, and as mention is made of Moschus, the need for the italic ' M ' is frequent. The supply of the letter is exhausted early in the composition, and the roman capital is substituted for the italic. The substituted pieces in this play are not divided from the proper pieces by the clear lines of demarcation that we have noticed in the preceding examples. On the contrary there appears after the first few pages a complete indifference to the distinctions between italic and roman capital 'M'. It is evident that the compositor's solution (a common one) has been to distribute italic and roman pieces of the capital 'M' into the same box indiscriminately and to use them thereafter without any regard to proper style. It is possible, however, by counting the number of italic pieces on each page to determine the proportion of italic to substituted roman. These ratios show clearly that in the pages of the outer formes there are more italic ' M ' pieces than there are roman and in the pages of the inner formes there are fewer italic ' M ' pieces than there are roman. The pages have consequently been arranged in the table by formes, the outer preceding as they exhibit the greater supply of the italic. (To conserve space A2, title page, and A2 v , Argument, have been omitted; they contain no ' M ' forms.) A3 3 v 4 4 v B1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 C1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 M - 1 2 3 15 8 3 8 9 3 15 9 5 8 5 1 4 2 M 6 3 4 14 13 4 1 8 12 6 3 5 11 Total: italic/roman 34/9 12/31 37/25 12/25 D1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 E1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 F1 1 v 2 2 v M 12 13 6 6 3 3 1 4 5 3 10 18 9 8 11 15 7 3 - - M 11 5 4 5 6 4 8 7 3 4 7 11 11 1 7 14 15 7 37/25 11/25 36/25 43/33 10/22 The last line of the table contains the ratio of pieces by formes. The figure to the left of the virgule represents the number of italic pieces in the forme, that to the right the number of roman pieces. Thus we have in sheets B, C, and D, a high proportion of italic in the outer and precedent formes, a low proportion of italic in the inner and subsequent formes. It would seem, furthermore, that the supply and the proportion of italic ' M ' used for setting each forme were derived from the distribution of the comparable forme of the immediately preceding sheet. So we note that the twelve italic ' M ' pieces used in sheet B inner are reused (and no others) in sheet C inner; the 37 italic pieces in sheet D outer are reused (and no others) in sheet E outer. The outer forme of sheet E evidently parallels the outer formes of sheets B, C, and D, for it shares the same relatively high proportion of italic pieces. But the inner forme of sheet E offers figures that are entirely disproportionate to all other inner formes, and that resemble in fact much more the figures of the outer formes. On the other hand the pages of half-sheet F exhibit, where we should expect figures correlative to the outer forme, figures exactly correlative to the inner formes. The situation would be explained by supposing the composition of half-sheet F prior to the composition of the inner forme of sheet E. When this rearrangement is made, the resulting figures are found to be perfectly regular and in keeping with the rest of the quarto. D1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 E1 2 v 3 4 v F1 1 v E1 v 2 3 v 4 M 12 13 6 6 3 3 1 4 5 3 10 18 7 3 - - 9 8 11 15 M 11 5 4 5 6 4 8 7 3 4 7 11 15 7 11 1 7 14 37/25 11/25 36/25 10/22 43/33 The hypothesis is a curious one and would hardly be tenable were it not that the analysis of the running titles proves that after E outer was imposed, half-sheet F was interjected before the imposition of E inner. 15 There is an explanation for this phenomenon. The proportions of the mixed font of italic and roman 'M' reveal that the compositor was distributing his formes in a regular pattern and was managing to keep up with the press. But he was not gaining on the press as he was in the Contention , and any opportunity to save composition time would therefore have been welcomed. The composition of half-sheet F was such an opportunity. Half-sheet F consisted of two pages of type and two blank pages; these could have been prepared in just half the time required for the usual four-page forme. But these two pages required just as much time on the press as a full four-page forme. If the compositor was being hurried by the press, he could have gained time by setting the two-page forme out of order. Running-title evidence and type-shortage evidence combine to argue that this procedure was followed here. But the question may well be posed why the compositor in the Contention was able to gain on his press and in the Menechmi was not. The answer lies in the nature of the texts. The Contention was a public play on a patriotic subject designed for the boards; the Menechmi was a private play, designed for the closet. It was the first translation of Plautus printed in English and was admitted to be a trial venture in the printer's address to the reader. There is hardly a need to look for further evidence that the edition was a small one. In a small edition press time would be briefer than composition time, and the compositor would always be concerned lest he fall behind and so delay his press. 16 The Comicall Historie of Alphonsus , King of Aragon (STC 12233), printed by Creede in 1599, presents yet another solution made by the compositor to the problem of a deficiency of type in the italic font used also in the Menechmi . The normal practice of the compositor is to set all proper names in the text in contrasting italic type. In a violation of that practice, proper names of persons are set in this play in non-contrasting roman type in the inner formes of sheets B and C and in the outer formes of sheets D and E. A closer look discloses that the question is not simply one of the setting of personal names, but of the setting of personal names beginning with 'A'. The text includes the characters Alphonsus, Albinius, Amurack, and Arcastus, and references are frequent to Aragon, Asia, and Africa. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the shortage of capital italic ' A ', induced by the excessive need for the character, is closely related to the failure to use italic for personal names, first for personal names beginning with 'A' and thence for all personal names. It is on sig. B2 that the shortage of italic ' A ' is first apparent, and it is on the same page that personal names are first set in roman type. Thereafter the shortage of ' A ' as it appears in the various pages of the sheets clearly argues for composition by formes, for the precedence in composition of the outer forme in sheets B and C, the inner forme in sheets D through H, and for distribution after each sheet. 17 A3 3 v 4 4 v B1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 Italic ' A ' found in prefixes 1. 2 4 3 1 5 2 8 Italic ' A ' found in place names 2. 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 Italic ' A ' found in personal names 3. 3 2 2 3 3 6 1 2 Roman 'A' found in prefixes 4. 6 Roman 'A' found in italic personal names 5. 1 1 Roman 'A' found in roman personal names 6. 8 1 Roman 'A' found in italic place names 7. 1 Roman 'A' found in roman place names 8. 1 Roman 'A' found in Other personal names in roman 9. 1 4 C1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 D1 v 2 3 v 4 1 2 v 3 4 v E1 v 2 3 v 4 1 2 v 3 4 v 1. 1 2 4 3 2 1 2 1 1 3 1 1 2 1 1 1 2. 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 4 4 1 1 1 3. 3 1 5 1 1 3 4 4 5 1 1 4 5 1 6 1 7 6 4. 5. 6. 3 2 2 4 3 3 7 6 4 2 7. 1 1 8. 9. 3 1 4 3 7 5 3 6 3 4 1 F1 v 2 3 v 4 1 2 v 3 4 v G1 v 2 3 v 4 1 2 v 3 4 v H1 v 2 3 v 4 1 2 v 3 4 v 1. 3 2 3 2 1 4 3 1 2 2 1 3 2. 1 1 2 1 2 3. 4 1 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 2 2 1 6 7 4 5 2 5 4 4. 1 1 2 5. 4 1 1 2 5 3 6. 7. 1 3 8. 9.

Confronted with the problem of an inadequacy of italic ' A ', the compositor was obliged to find a solution. His solution was to set personal names in italic until the supply of italic ' A ' began to diminish ( i.e. , after the completion of the first forme of the sheet), then to set such names completely in roman in order to avoid the mixture of italic and roman in the same word (the mixture is standard in the Menechmi ). Such a decision provided for (1) uniformity of font in each word, (2) uniformity of pattern in setting (by including all personal names, not merely those beginning in 'A'), and (3) a supply of italic ' A ' for use in place names and in speech prefixes, where the absence of the proper font would be more conspicuous. Thus at the beginning of B2, having used 45 italic ' A ' forms, the compositor was faced with a demand for sixteen more pieces of the character. These he did not have, and he was forced to substitute the roman 'A' to make up the deficiency. He set the prefixes on the page in italic type but with roman capitals, and he set one word in the text in the same "mixed-font" manner. At this point the decision was made to set all personal names in roman in the text as the supply of italic ' A ' began to diminish, so that the lower-case letters would be uniform with the roman capitals, and to reserve the italic capitals for the prefixes. The few remaining italic pieces were used for the prefixes on B3 v and B4, and personal names in the text were set in roman. The pattern thus described for sheet B with a preceding forme containing personal names fully italicized, a succeeding forme showing signs of shortage of italic ' A ' by the use of roman personal names is constant through sheet E. Sheet B required 66 italic ' A ' pieces, and on the basis of this requirement the compositor adopted his method for setting the rest of the quarto. The number was above average, for no other sheet required so many. The compositor therefore began to abandon the policy in sheet E, setting personal names beginning with other letters in italic after E3, and in sheet F setting personal names beginning with 'A' in italic even though a roman capital had to be used. Sheet F used only eighteen pieces of italic ' A ', and as a result sheet G was set with only one irregular roman form, doubtless an oversight. The 43 capitals required in sheet G induced the usual shortage in sheet H and in turn in sheet I. The evidence from type shortage in Alphonsus tells us the order of composition of the formes and indirectly reveals information on a quite different matter, the setting of roman type in the place of italic. The examples presented thus far have been from a small shop. Though the limited facilities of the small shop offer more opportunity for evidence of type shortage, these examples are not unusual, and exceptional demands of certain texts will cause type shortages to appear in works from larger shops as well. One more example from another shop will be presented here. In his discussion of the "bad" quarto of Romeo and Juliet (1597) (STC 22322), Dr. Harry R. Hoppe pointed out that sheets E through K were set by two compositors alternating in this manner: X: E1 E2 v E3-4 v F3-4 v G3-4 v H3-4 v I3-4 v K3-3 v Y: E1 v -2 F1-2 v G1-2 v H1-2 v I1-2 v K1-2 v K4 Mr. Hoppe's argument was based on spelling characteristics of the two men. 18 The evidence from type shortage suggests that Compositor X was setting his half of the sheet by formes (the outer first) in the order 3 4 v 3 v 4, with a distribution at the beginning of each sheet (with the possible exception of sheet H). 19 On eleven of the thirteen pages where both forms of letters occur, the dividing lines are distinct; on F4 v ' R ' and 'R' are mixed, and on F3 v one proper 'W' is misplaced. E F G H I K 3 4 v 3 v 4 3 4 v 3 v 4 3 4 v 3 v 4 3 4 v 3 v 4 3 4 v 3 v 4 3 3 (4) 20 R 4 5 3 3 8 3 1 4 1 1 1 3 1 2 4 4 1 R 4 8 5 1 8 5 4 I 5 6 2 5 3 5 5 2 3 5 4 4 1 5 2 2 1 3 2 3 3 I 3 2 2 6 3 N 5 1 4 5 2 3 3 1 2 N 7 2 1 W 4 2 4 2 3 8 1 6 2 3 2 4 7 1 VV 3 4 2 5 1 4 9 6 The pattern of type shortage in the work of Compositor Y is much less clear than that in the work of X, though Compositor Y too would seem to have set by formes (indeed there would be no purpose in having X set by formes and Y set seriatim), because the cases used by Y are in several letters more adequately stocked than those used by X, and for other letters Y is less concerned to keep his proper type-pieces and his substitutes unmixed. The evidence is not so convincing as could be wished, and I hesitate to speculate further. The examples that have been presented in this paper have demonstrated the utility of this particular sort of investigation in shedding light on mechanical and on compositorial practices that offer problems to the bibliographer. Type shortages can often reveal the order of composition of the pages of a sheet and the times of distribution; sometimes they can point to much more information. As the evidence can be shown to derive from peculiarities of the type and from the nonliterary reactions of the compositor and not from any oddity of the copy, these instances provide arguments from what is purely bibliographical information. Type-shortage evidence should provide a new tool for bibliographical investigation.</field>

The quartos discussed here have all been examined at the Folger Shakespeare Library and/or on University Microfilms. For none of these quartos does the STC list an earlier edition; I assume therefore, subject to correction, that all of the plays are first editions, set from manuscript. 6 This is an oversimplification. Two 'w' sorts appear at the top of the page in lines 1-3; they are followed by nine 'vv' forms in lines 4-13; they by a single 'w' in line 14; it by the remaining 21 'vv' forms. The single 'w' in line 14 is clearly a piece that had been misplaced and was discovered by the compositor in time to be set in the middle of the page. The three 'W' forms occur in lines 1-24; the two 'VV' forms in lines 24-36. 7 Surprising as it may seem, indifference to the w/vv distinction is indicated by the compositor of the 1613 quarto of The Insatiate Countesse , who uses the two forms indiscriminately or possibly as a means of justification. 8 This is not an argument that can be advanced in texts of any length, but in this short work it seems valid. Distribution in the middle of a sheet is common (see below). 9 A different order for the pages of sheet A is suggested by the apparent shortage of ' k ' and the substitution of 'k': A1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 k 4 3 4 2 - 6 k 1 5 10 As this order violates the order of imposition and printing as disclosed by the running-title evidence and as the witness from ' k ' is far from dependable in the rest of the quarto, it seems safest to follow the unequivocal and consistent evidence of the shortage of 'w'. If one could believe that the single 'vv' on A1 was the result of influence from the preceding ' VV ' and that the title page was composed first in the sheet rather than last, this theory would account for the four proper ' k ' forms on that page. But the presence of the 'vv' — and of the ' VV ' too — would seem to militate against this position. Though the shortage of ' W ' is not dependable as evidence, the presence of the substitute on the first page of the quarto to be set seems unlikely. It is of interest to note that the running title for A3 contains the proper italic ' k ' while that for A4 has the 'k.' 10 Evidence from running titles indicates that outer B preceded inner through the press. 11 Of the ten pages on which both forms occur, the divisions of 'w' and 'vv' are clearcut and distinct on A4, B3, B3 v , G4 v , H1, and H3 v . On D4 v , E4 v , and G1 v only one of the proper sort is misplaced. On C3 v the order is mixed: 7 w, 1 vv, 10 w, 1 vv, 2 w, 3 vv. 12 The sprinkling of the ' I ' substitutions mixed with 'I' on D3 may conceivably be traced to a missorting of the substitutions in the distribution of page B4. As B inner was probably distributed at the beginning of sheet D, the substitutions might well turn up in a single cluster of missorts on a subsequent page. (C outer, however, was distributed in the middle of D2 v .) 13 The distribution of B inner at the beginning of sheet D yields 75 'w' pieces. These are used up by line 23 of D2 v . The italic ' A ' substitution occurs in lines 13 through 25; the proper form resumes in line 31. The proximity of the final substitute ' A ' in line 25 and the anticipated but not realized exhaustion of 'w' in line 24 would suggest that at some point near lines 24 and 25 the distribution of C outer took place. 14 In the discussion following the oral presentation of this paper, Mr. Hinman rendered this supposition less startling by pointing to an analogy in the printing of the Shakespeare First Folio. 15 Another indication that this hypothesis is correct is provided by the pattern of swash italic capital ' M ' in the text. Such sorts appear once on each of these pages: B1, B3, C1, C3, D1, D4 v , E3, E4 v , and twice on E4. It is thus seen that only two of these pieces were available to the compositor (two more were left standing and used regularly in the recto running titles) who used them in the outer formes of sheets B, C, D, and E. They do not appear in half-sheet F where we should normally have expected them, but they do appear in the inner forme of sheet E. This reappearance out of normal order indicates that one forme, viz., half-sheet F, has intervened between the composition of the formes of sheet E. 16 Mr. Sidney Thomas ("The Date of The Comedy of Errors ," SQ, VII [1956], 381-382) has suggested that the "long-tailed title" for the entry of the Menechmi in the Stationers' Register was probably taken from an edition already in print by 1594 of which no copies have survived. But this title must have been taken from the manuscript copy which Creede tells us has circulated "for the use and delight of [the author's] private friends," for the printer promises further plays of Plautus if the Menechmi receives "courteous acceptance" (sig. A3). As no other Plautine comedies were published for another century (Wing lists P-2415 in 1694), it would seem unlikely that another edition had preceded Creede's of 1595. Bibliographical evidence that the 1595 edition was a small one corroborates the historical probability that there had been no demand for an earlier edition. 17 On the evidence of the running titles in the DFo copy of the play it appears that the outer forme of sheet I preceded the inner through the press. 18 Harry R. Hoppe, The Bad Quarto of Romeo and Juliet (1948), pp. 47-56. 19 Running titles suggest that inner H may have preceded outer through the press. Type-shortage evidence in the latter half of the sheet would corroborate the theory, arguing that X composed in the order 3 v 4 4 v 3. 20 The figures for K4 are included in this table, because though that page was set by Compositor Y it was set from the cases of Compositor X. This hypothesis is proved (1) by the shortage of 'W' on the page, a shortage common in the sections set by X but not found in the sections set by Y and (2) by the appearance of a swash italic capital ' I ' on the page, one of five (?) such pieces in the case of Compositor X found on no other pages set by Y. The italic " R " in the catchword on 13 v is not included in these figures as it seems to be from a font of a larger sort in the DFo copy; it seems normal in the CSmH film.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">On the First Folio Text of Henry VIII by R. A. Foakes</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AS ALICE WALKER RECENTLY EMPHASIZED 1 , THE study of the ways of compositors in spelling and other usages in Shakespearian texts may help to shed light on their "metamorphosis into print", and a knowledge of the compositors' habits at each stage of their work in the First Folio is useful as filling out a picture from which generalisations may at some time be drawn. The following remarks on the Folio text of Henry VIII may then have some general interest. As far as this play is concerned, they support the conclusion of W. W. Greg 2 that the text derived from a "carefully edited" fair copy, and they suggest further that it was in a single hand. Discussion of the play has been complicated by the question of authorship, a bogy which arose in the nineteenth century, 3 and has troubled editors and critics ever since. These have usually divided the play between Fletcher and Shakespeare, and a distinction between the work of the two compositors who set the Folio text also has a direct bearing upon this. The well-known main differences in the spelling used by Jaggard A and Jaggard B, the compositors who between them set most of the Folio in type, 4 reveal a clear division of labour in the text of Henry VIII . The shares of the compositors are as follows: Compositor A (16 pages): t4 r -v2 r ; v3 r , v3 v ; x3 r , x3 v Compositor B (13 pages): t3 r , t3 v ; v2 v ; v4 r -x2 v The evidence of the spellings is best presented in tabular form: Compositor A Compositor B goe 11 0 go 1 6 doe 43 0 do 4 25 here 6 0 heere 16 14 young 6 0 yong 0 3 Some words which have been observed to reveal spelling differences in other plays 5 do not occur frequently enough in this text, or they afford a blurred evidence, or no evidence at all; examples are the words "year" (5 times set by A, 2 by B), and "devil" (3 by A, 4 by B), which always have the same spelling. On the other hand, a few spellings and uses of accidentals which occur not at all in some plays, or not in sufficient number to provide certain evidence, offer a clear distinction between the work of the compositors in Henry VIII . The habits of the compositors may have changed as time went by during the printing of the Folio, 6 and some new or previously unnoticed variations may be appearing here. The following table presents this evidence: Compositor A Compositor B to th' 17 1 to' th' 0 5 tis 7 0 'tis 7 6 busines 10 0 businesse 9 12 highnes 7 0 highnesse 11 17 honour 24 1 honor 1 25 lose 1 0 loose (lose) 1 4 One more peculiarity may be noticed, that is B's apparent fondness for "too" as a spelling of "to"; he uses it ten times as against twice by A. An interesting feature of these statistics is that A seems to have been a little less consistent than B in his usages, 7 and it may be that many of B's preferential spellings appeared in the manuscript. A striking confirmation of this evidence is provided by differences in the spellings of speech-headings in the play, and in this matter A is more consistent than B. Again the differences are best presented in the form of statistics: Compositor A Compositor B Buck . 12 2 Buc . 0 11 Norf(f) . 17 3 Nor . 0 25 Card . 22 12 Car . 0 24 Kin . 49 0 King . 3 28 Suff . 10 1 Suf . 0 17 Quee(n) . 20 1 Qu . 0 7 One further piece of evidence is afforded by the brief appearance on the stage of Dr Butts, the King's physician, in V.ii. His name occurs 8 times in speech-headings and in the text, and it so happens that these are distributed between x2 v , set by B, and x3 r , set by A; B spells the name "Buts" (5 times), and A spells it "Butts" (3 times). The shares of the text which fell to the two compositors in no way correspond to the shares often assigned by critics to the two authors, Shakespeare and Fletcher. The most compelling arguments for dual authorship have been assembled by A. C. Partridge, 8 who has reaffirmed the division proposed by Spedding, allocating to Shakespeare I.i and ii; II.iii and iv; III.ii.1-203; and V.i. The rest of the play he assigns to Fletcher, offering as his main evidence the occurrence of forms which Fletcher habitually used (notably 'em , for them , and ye ) predominantly in this part. He found 59 examples of the use of 'em in the section ascribed to Fletcher, as compared with 5 in that ascribed to Shakespeare, and 72 examples of ye , as compared with only 2 in Shakespeare's part. One 'em crept into this total through an emendation of the Folio text, but allowing for this, the forms are spread across the work of the two compositors to the following extent: 'em appears 12 times in the work of B, 51 times in the work of A; ye appears 24 times in the work of B, 48 times in the work of A. The spread is uneven, partly because A set many more than B of the lines ascribed to Fletcher, 9 partly, as Philip Williams Jr. pointed out, 10 because A, as was his habit, no doubt reproduced his copy more literally than B, who may have normalized a number of these forms. Another feature of the text of Henry VIII is interesting because it seems to be unrelated either to the division between the work of the compositors, or to the postulated division between authors. The speech-headings for certain characters vary in what appears to be an inconsequential manner. Some minor variations, such as the change from Qu. or Quee(n). in the early scenes to Kath. in IV.ii signify little. In one case the variation is important because it causes confusion between characters; the Lord Chamberlain, who appears earlier in the play as L. Ch. becomes Cham . in V.ii, where, as a result, there is confusion between him and the Lord Chancellor ( Chan. ), and the Folio gives to Cham. speeches which, as Capell noted, belong to the Lord Chancellor, who is conducting the business of the Council in this scene. The most significant variations, however, are those in the speech-headings used for Wolsey. 11 He figures first as Car(d). in the work of both compositors, but on v1 v (II.ii), after the entry, "Enter Wolsey and Campeius with a commission", the heading changes to Wol. . On this page, the work of A, the new heading may have been introduced by transference from the name in the entry. The next page contains no speeches by Wolsey, who returns on v2 v , (II.iv), for which B was responsible, first as Car. (II.iv.1, 5), then as Wol. (l. 55ff.); here there is no mention of his name in the text to suggest such change. The next two pages, the work of A again, have both Card. and Wol(s). . Then follows a longish stretch of text set by B; on v4 r , v4 v , and v5 r , only Car(d). is used, until again at III.ii.252, and for a few later speeches on v5 v , the heading Wol. recurs, again for no discernible reason. On all except the first page on which Wol. appears (v1 v ), the two forms alternate on the same page, and the intrusion of Wol. cannot be explained as a transference from the text, or by a shortage of italic capital C , which abounds throughout the play, in speech-headings for the Chamberlain, the Chancellor, Cromwell, and Cranmer, as well as in stage directions. This variation in speech-headings cannot then be related to compositors. Since it extends across scenes ascribed both to Fletcher (II.ii; III.i; III.ii.204ff.), and to Shakespeare (II.iv; III.ii.1-203), it cannot be linked with the theory of dual authorship. It is safe to assume that it was in the copy from which the compositors worked and a little may be added to W. W. Greg's conclusion that "The copy for F was clearly a carefully prepared manuscript, in whose hand or hands there is no evidence to show. It could have been used as a prompt-book, but there is no indication that it was." 12 It seems likely that the manuscript was in a single hand. The printed text is very clean, and, except for variations in spelling and usage for which the scribe was not responsible, consistently good. Its general appearance, the very full and elaborately set-out stage directions and entries, and the full division into acts and scenes, indicate fair copy. The mixed speech-headings, unless two writers are postulated who both used the same ones, also seem to point to a single scribe, who failed to regularize, or only partially regularized, what he found in the papers from which he copied, and, perhaps, suggest a single author. There seem to be no changes in spelling or usage of the kind which Philip Williams Jr. observed in the text of I Henry VI , 13 and which might indicate a change in manuscript copy. One small detail lends further support; the name "Gilbert Pecke" occurs twice in the text, at I.i.219, in a scene by Shakespeare, and at II.i.20, in a scene ascribed to Fletcher. This is almost certainly a mistake for or an alteration of Holinshed's "Gilbert Perke"; and since the historian is elsewhere followed closely with respect to names, and the change here is pointless, it is safe to assume that the author (s) wrote "Perke", which the scribe misread as "Pecke". However the form arose, it must have been written in the same way at the two places where it appeared in the manuscript from which the text was set. With regard to the origin of the copy, the variations in speech-headings which give rise to the confusion noted above between Cham. and Chan. in V.ii, and could cause difficulty in III.i., where Car(d). might represent either of the two cardinals (Wolsey and Campeius) on stage, afford contributory evidence towards the supposition that the copy stemmed from foul papers. Greg's statement on the play may be modified to this extent; that the copy for the Folio Henry VIII was a carefully prepared manuscript, probably in a single hand; there is no indication that it was used as a prompt-book, whereas there is evidence from variations in speech-headings and the confusion these might occasion in the theatre, to suggest that it was based on foul papers. A study of the habits of the compositors in the text of Henry VIII thus offers not only further examples of their differences in usage and spelling, but also some evidence bearing on the transmission of the text, and on the authorship problem.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Printer's Copy for The Two Noble Kinsmen by Frederick O. Waller *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BECAUSE THE FIRST PRINTED TEXT OF THE TWO Noble Kinsmen , the quarto of 1634, preserves a number of manifest signs of prompt annotation, it has been assumed that the printer's copy was a prompt book, and specifically the prompt book that the King's company used for a revival of the play which apparently took place in the middle 1620's. In the notes to his edition of the play in The Shakespeare Apocrypha (1908), C. F. Tucker Brooke said that the "text is based upon the prompter's stage copy, as we know from the S.D.D. to I.iii.68, I.v.28, &amp;c." (p. 434). In William Shakespeare (1930), Sir Edmund Chambers remarked that "evidently the manuscript had been used as prompt-copy" (I, 529), and in an article published in 1945, Sir Walter Greg stated that the quarto "shows unmistakable signs of having been set up from the very prompt-book used by the King's company." 1 In his latest work Greg adds that Q was "evidently printed from a prompt-copy written or at least annotated by Edward Knight, book-keeper in the King's company" ( The Shakespeare First Folio [1955], p. 98). But a close examination of the basic text of the play suggests that the case may not be quite so simple: whereas the printed text does show unmistakable signs of the prompter's hand in marginal warning notes and in actors' names, it also exhibits certain other textual peculiarities that point to foul papers. If so, then the printer's copy for Q would constitute annotated foul papers, a species of manuscript which Greg has elsewhere inferred from what appears to be the original draft of Heywood's The Captives . Heywood's autograph manuscript bears elaborate prompt annotations in another hand, but since both hands are too foul for prompt copy, the inference is that in this case the book-keeper did his work of stage adaptation on the author's foul papers with a view to having a transcript made for the prompter presumably by another hand. That would be the natural procedure unless the book-keeper were himself, like Knight, something of a calligrapher, which the annotator of The Captives clearly was not . . . . Clearly foul papers annotated by the book-keeper are one of the types of manuscript we shall have to take into account ( ibid. , p. 109). And in a note, Greg adds, "If the inference here made is correct, the important conclusion follows that a printed text that shows distinctive marks of the prompter may yet have been printed from foul papers." The "distinctive marks of the prompter" shown in the Kinsmen do not seem to have been introduced for the original production. Scholars are now generally agreed that the play was written in 1613. The date is primarily established by the use in a morris dance in the play of the same characters who constitute the cast for the second anti-masque of Beaumont's Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn , presented at Whitehall on February 20, 1613. There is, however, no external reference to the play's first performance; the first which occurs appears on a scrap of paper from the Revels Office probably dating about 1619, and seems to indicate consideration for court performance. 2 The prompter's notes belong to a revival of 1625 or 1626; two actors he cast as minor characters were employed by the company together during those years only. The pertinent directions are printed as follows 3 : Enter Messengers. Curtis . (IV.ii.72, sig. I4 v ) Scaena 3. Enter Theseus, Hipolita, Emilia, Perithous: and some Attendants, T. Tucke: Curtis . (V.iii, sig. L4 v ) " Curtis " has been identified as Curtis Greville, an actor who left the Lady Elizabeth's men for the Palsgrave's company in 1622 and had joined the King's men by the fall of 1626, when his name appeared in the cast of The Roman Actor , licensed October 11; Bentley suggests he probably joined the King's company in 1625 at the time of the reorganization of the companies. 4 "T. Tucke" is evidently an abbreviation for Thomas Tuckfield, whose name appears twelfth in the list of "Musitions and other necessary attendantes" of the company, whom Sir Henry Herbert exempted from arrest on December 27, 1624. 5 The Two Noble Kinsmen provides the only record of his appearance on the stage; and since his name is not in the full list of actors printed with The Roman Actor , it has been assumed that he was not with the company when that play was performed in 1626. Greville and Tuckfield were members of the company together, therefore, for no more than two years, and in view of the severity of the plague through most of 1625, a revival of the Kinsmen in the winter of 1625 or spring of 1626 seems likeliest. As shall be shown in a moment, the inferior limit is also confirmed by the marginal warnings. The warning notes are printed in the outside margins of verso and recto pages, in small roman type; also so printed is one instance of what appears to be an authorial direction: 1. "2. Hearses rea-/dy with Pala-/mon: and Arci-/te: the 3. / Queenes. / Theseus: and / his Lordes / ready." (I.iii.58 ff., sig. C3 v ) 2. "3. Hearses rea-/dy." (I.iv.26, sig. C4 v ) 3. "This short flo-/rish of Cor-/nets and / Showtes with-/in." (II.v, opposite opening stage-direction, sig. E4 v ) 4. "Cornets in / sundry places. / Noise and / hallowing as / people a May-/ing." (III.i, opposite act division, sig. F2) 5. "Chaire and / stooles out." (III.v.64-65, sig. G2 v ) 6. "Knocke for / Schoole. Enter / The Dance." (III.v.137-39, sig. G3 v ) 7. "They bow se-/verall wayes: / then advance / and stand." (III.vi.93-96, sig. H1 v ) In addition, one speech-prefix, " Daughter. ", is printed in the left margin, at III.v.60, sig. G2 v . The first, second, and fifth of these are clearly the prompter's annotations. The specification of particular musical instruments and effects in the third and fourth sounds like the prompter, while the sixth appears to be the prompter's direction for a signal to bring on the morris dance. But the language as well as the substance of the seventh sounds authorial. That the direction appears in the left margin may be due to an absence of space in the white area to the right of the speeches, although elsewhere the compositors have set long directions between lines of speech, as, for example, on the next page. And there is another point to be noted: just opposite the first line of the direction, within a line of speech, there appears a star or asterisk, as follows: They bow severall wayes: then advance and stand. Arc. And me my love: * Is there ought else to say? Pal. This onely, and no more . . . It is difficult to avoid the inference that there is a connection between the direction and the star—that the star is intended to mark the point where the action specified by the direction is to occur. If so, the direction is probably an authorial gloss. 6 It is a fair a priori assumption that all the prompt annotations were made at the same time that the actors' names were introduced into the text, by the same hand; and there is some evidence, I think, that this is so in fact. The King's company's book-keeper at the time of the revival was probably Edward Knight; his name appears at the head of Herbert's protection of 1624, and he is specifically identified as the book-keeper by an entry in Herbert's Office Book, dated October 21, 1633. The extant prompt copy of The Honest Man's Fortune , still bearing Herbert's licence of February 8, 1625, is in his hand, and it has been suggested that he took up his duties as book-keeper not long before that date. 7 Now, all of Knight's manuscripts show a distinctive use of colons in name-sequences. His practice may be illustrated by a few examples from The Honest Man's Fortune and Believe as you List , the latter a manuscript in Massinger's hand but annotated and prepared for the stage by Knight. 8 At III.iii.37-39 in the former, an entry in the left margin reads, " Ent: Montagne : / bare: Lamyra : / Lady Orleance : / Charlot: Viram :". Or at the head of IV.ii, the following: " Ent : Dubois: Orleance: Longauile: Amience : / .2. Lacqueyes: A Page w th .2. Pistolls :". A typical example from Believe as you List is the entry in the left margin at ll. 342-344: " Ent: fflaminius : / Calistus: Demetri :". Massinger's own use of periods in name-sequences may be illustrated by the direction which Knight's replaces: " enter Titus flaminivs. Calistus . / Demetrius . 2 freedmen ." The cancelled direction is some six lines below Knight's. The sequence of names in the first of the Kinsmen's marginal notes is also punctuated with colons, and this feature, as Sir Walter Greg has suggested, 9 points to the hand of Edward Knight. It may be noted, too, that the single sequence of actors' names similarly shows a colon, in distinction from the sequence of character names to which it is attached; and in view of the probability arising from the date of the revival that Knight introduced the actors' names, it seems to be a reasonable assumption that the colon here is his. The punctuation in part of the direction at the head of I.iv may also be Knight's. The entire direction is printed in Q as follows: Cornets . Scaena 4. A Battaile strooke withi[n]: Then a Retrait: Florish. Then Enter Theseus (victor) the three Queenes meete him, and fall on their faces before him . The description of the action sounds authorial, but the specification of off-stage noises and music in the first line, where the colons appear, could very well be the prompter's. 10 The mid-sentence capitalization of Enter , not duplicated elsewhere in the text, suggests that the words preceding may have been an addition. Otherwise, the stage-directions in Q are punctuated in what might be called conventional fashion, without an unusual use of colons in sequence. It would follow, therefore, that Knight did not transcribe the basic copy to which the annotations were made; in other words, the prompt annotations must be additions to the original manuscript and not integral parts of it; and if the clearly identifiable signs of prompt use are eliminated, it appears that the original manuscript may not have been a prompt copy. A prompt copy was prepared in 1613, presumably, when the play was written and first produced. If this copy was not available when the play was revived, what kind of copy could the company archives have supplied Edward Knight when he made his annotations preparatory to the revival? Whatever it was, it was this copy with Knight's annotations which John Waterson, the publisher, obtained (from the playhouse, presumably 11 ) for his quarto of 1634. Authors' fair copy may be eliminated because, first of all, the quarto exhibits too many irregularities for fair copy, either authorial or scribal. These will be surveyed in a moment. Secondly, Q shows two distinct linguistic habits which correspond to the authorial divisions indicated by other areas of evidence —metrical, stylistic, etc . The implication of this is that an authorial draft in the hands of the two authors lies behind the quarto; a faithful copyist might preserve the authors' linguistic preferences, but an authorial fair copy would be likely to bear the impress of whichever of the collaborators made the copy, for it may be supposed that the responsibility of preparing the fair copy would fall to one of the authors, the better that any imperfections resulting from divided authorship might be removed. As will be seen, Q bears a number of just such marks of jointure. There remain, then, foul papers, probably the likeliest possibility on a priori grounds, or a form of intermediate scribal transcript, a class of manuscript Professor Fredson Bowers has recently postulated; such a copy, he suggests, might have been prepared from foul papers for "consideration, revision, submission to the censor, copying of the parts, or sometimes for marking and cutting in preparation for the final prompt copy." 12 The characteristics of foul papers have been summarized by Greg as follows: . . . loose ends and false starts and unresolved confusions in the text, which sometimes reveal themselves as duplications in print: next, inconsistency in the designation of characters in directions and prefixes alike, and occasionally the substitution of the name of an actor, when the part is written with a particular performer in view: lastly, the appearance of indefinite and permissive stage-directions, and occasionally of explanatory glosses on the text. 13 According to Professor Bowers, however, some of these marks might persist in an intermediate transcript: . . . some scribes might attempt to clean up difficulties in the act of transcribing, but unless the scribe were the book-keeper himself, it is more probable that he would usually concentrate on making a more or less faithful copy of the foul papers before him, and would reproduce many of the very authorial characteristics which in printed form are taken as indicating foul papers. 14 Bowers (following Hoy) cites the 1647 Folio text of Fletcher's Wife for a Month as perhaps exemplifying such a transcript, because on the one hand the textual tangles the play exhibits make it unlikely that a prompt copy stood behind the printed text, and on the other, "there is a considerable diminution in some classes, though not in all, of Fletcher's linguistic characteristics, which cannot be laid at the door of the printer," but which may be due to scribal intervention. Now, the quarto Kinsmen exemplifies all of the stigmata of foul papers listed by Greg except the "substitution of the name of an actor, when the part is written with a particular performer in view"; but it also shows the same kind of evidence for an intervening scribal transcript to which Bowers refers above—that is, in the scenes assigned to Fletcher there is a reduction from his usual practice in the number of ye 's. The problem this represents will be discussed in a moment; first, however, the evidence for foul papers. So far as the sense of the spoken word is concerned, Q is generally fair. Still, there are a number of passages which can hardly represent the authors' final intentions. Many of the difficulties in Q are of course compositorial in origin; Clough hee (I.i.20), for example, is probably only a misreading of Chough hore . But there are some obscurities arising from the syntax, which must be, therefore, authorial. In I.iii.19-22, the essential meaning is clear enough, but the words must have sorely tried the art of the actor who had to read the passage as it stands: Or tell of Babes broachd on the Launce, or women That have sod their Infants in (and after eate them) The brine, they wept at killing 'em; Then if You stay to see of us such Spincsters . . . . The sentence would be less disturbing if the parenthetical element were transposed to the line below, following "killing 'em"; a misplaced marginal or interlinear addition or revision might be conjectured, although reconstruction is difficult. Part of the trouble with a later passage in the same scene is probably compositorial misreading, but the passage remains defective even when the obvious corruptions are corrected. In Q, lines 72-82 read as follows: . . . her affections (pretty Though happely, her careles, were, I followed For my most serious decking, had mine eare Stolne some new aire, or at adventure humd on From misicall Coynadge, why it was a note Whereon her spirits would sojourne (rather dwell on) And sing it in her slumbers; This rehearsall (Which fury-innocent wots well) comes in Like old importments bastard, has this end, That the true love tweene Mayde, and mayde, may be More then in sex individuall. "her careles, were," appears to be a misreading of "her careles weare," "humd on" must be a variant spelling for "humd one", and "misicall" is an obvious misprint. The emendation for "fury-innocent" now generally adopted is Lamb's "eu'ry innocent", although it does not satisfactorily answer all the questions which arise as to the origin of the error. Finally, "comes in Like old importments bastard" not only resists emendation but defies sense. The whole passage, which falls in one of the non-Fletcherian scenes, suggests that the author had not fully worked out his meaning, nor found adequate expression for it, and had written in an almost illegible hand. The jumble at I.iv.40-45 is one of the cruxes of the play. It is also in a non-Fletcherian scene: Since I have knowne frights, fury, friends, beheastes, Loves, provocations, zeale, a mistris Taske, Desire of liberty, a feavour, madnes, Hath set a marke which nature could not reach too Without some imposition, sicknes in will Or wrastling strength in reason . . . . Another tangle appears at V.iii.85-89, again a non-Fletcherian scene: . . . there were no woman Worth so composd a Man: their single share, Their noblenes peculier to them, gives The prejudice of disparity values shortnes To any Lady breathing------More exulting? As with the passage just above, some improvement may be effected by punctuational emendation, but even so the meaning, or a meaning, must be forced from the passage. There are other passages nearly as obscure, but these are the worst. In addition to textual tangle, there are two evident hiatuses in the play, at V.i.50 and V.iv.77. The former appears in print as follows: Thou mighty one, that with thy power hast turnd Greene Neptu[n]e into purple. 50 Comets prewarne, whose havocke in vaste Feild Vnearthed skulls proclaime . . . . And the latter: He kept him tweene his legges, on his hind hoofes on end he stands 77 That Arcites leggs being higher then his head Seem'd with strange art to hang . . . . In the former, an object for "prewarne", corresponding to "havocke" for "proclaime", seems necessary, and all editors following Seward have adopted "whose approach" arbitrarily. It is likely that merely illegible copy is at fault. Such may also be the case in the latter example; it may be conjectured, however, that the fragment of V.iv.77, "on end he stands", represents a revision of the four words immediately above in line 76, "on his hind hoofes". It would seem significant that all the passages cited fall in scenes traditionally assigned to Fletcher's collaborator. It is not to be expected, of course, that Fletcher and his co-author, whether or not he be Shakespeare, should have necessarily produced scenes of equal verbal clarity; indeed, one of the features which is invariably mentioned in discussions of the non-Fletcherian parts is their denseness or "knottiness". But such denseness is spoken of as a positive characteristic of style and thought, while the trouble with the passages cited may almost be described as an absence of style and thought. It would appear, therefore, that the copy presented some differences as to the state of finish between the Fletcherian and non-Fletcherian parts. Q also exhibits a number of defects in the stage-directions. An omission occurs in the opening entrance, wherein the names of Pirithous and Artesius are absent. Both characters are essential to the ensuing action. The discrimination against Pirithous may be laid to compositorial eye-skip, since Theseus's name appears twice in consecutive lines, once correctly and once where Pirithous should have been named. While the compositor may have overlooked Artesius, it is more likely, especially in view of another omission in a later scene, that the dramatist—the scene is one given to Shakespeare—had not fully planned the action when he wrote the initial stage-direction, or that in his concern with the pageantry of the wedding procession, he simply overlooked this minor functionary: Artesius is not involved in the action for some 160 lines, when he is directed to go out and gather an army. The other omission occurs at I.iv, another non-Fletcherian scene. This time the missing characters are a Herald and the kinsmen themselves; the latter are apparently to be borne in unconscious in the hearses provided by the marginal warning note printed thirty lines earlier (see no. 1, above). There is no provision, either, for the attending Lords who, as the prompter recognized, should have accompanied Theseus on this triumphal occasion. The omissions are too many to make it likely that the compositor is to blame; it rather appears that the author was intent on the action which opens the scene, the meeting of Theseus and the three Queens (strictly speaking, there is no entry for them either—only their meeting Theseus is specified), and in the moment of composition left the other characters to shift for themselves. The prompter's specification of Theseus's Lords in the marginal note at I.iii.58 incidentally reflects upon the adequacy of his manuscript with respect to the supernumeraries. In several other entrances, no attendants are indicated, when the circumstances clearly require them; for example, in addition to the omission noted above, the transport of the dying Arcite in his chair at V.iv.85 is left up to Theseus, Hipolita, and Emilia. However, Hipolita and Emilia were Amazons, and Theseus was the kinsman of Hercules. Otherwise, Q's stage-directions provide "attendants," "others," or most often, simply "&amp;c." A permissive direction also involving a discrepancy between the number of characters indicated in the stage-direction and ultimately presented on the stage should be particularly noted. It occurs at the beginning of III.v, the scene in which the morris dance drawn from Beaumont's masque is performed. Beaumont's original anti-masque called for six women and six men, plus a presenter; all had specific roles to play, the women's corresponding to the men's, such as He-Fool and She-Fool, He-Baboon and She-Baboon, etc . There is some question whether the parts in the play are exactly parallel to those in the anti-masque, 15 but it is certain that in both there are supposed to be six couples. When the Schoolmaster, acting as presenter, asks, "where's their women?" five respond by name. When he commands, "Couple then And see what's wanting", the absence of a sixth, Cicely, is discovered. Her part is eventually taken by the Jailer's Daughter, who wanders on the scene a little later. At the very outset, then, there are five women on stage; but the stage-direction provides for " a Schoole master .4. Countrymen : and Baum [read Bavian ] .2. or 3 wenches, with a Taborer ." The discrepancy is especially curious because the source for the piece, Beaumont's anti-masque, clearly requires six; either the author—Fletcher—had not decided at the beginning how all the women were to be gathered on stage or he was simply uncertain as to the composition of the cast. At any rate, the discrepancies point to an authorial manuscript of a species closer to foul paper than fair copy. The inconsistencies in the casting of both female and male parts (see note 15) lead one to wonder, indeed, if the author even had a complete text of Beaumont's masque before him as he wrote. The masque was licensed on February 27, 1613, and printed, presumably, shortly after, but the cast of the morris dance is given in a narrative description, in language reflecting the viewpoint of a reporter or spectator, rather than in the text proper; the 1647 Folio text is more likely to be based on Beaumont's own papers, and it has only the bare direction, " The second Antimasque rusheth in, they dance their measure, and as rudely depart ." It is quite improbable that the dance in the play was the genesis for that in the masque; Stowe's Annales (1631) speaks of the anti-masque as being of a strange and different fashion from others, both in habit and manners, a very delectable: a rural or country maske, consisting of many persons, men and women, being in sundry habits, likewise as strange, variable and delightful, 16 and as A. H. Thorndike wrote, "it is inconceivable that this antimasque should have been introduced into that notable court entertainment after having been staled at the public theatres." 17 Thorndike adds, however, that the company must have utilized the morris dance very shortly after the masque was presented, "while the novelty and success of this dance were common talk. A few years later, other antimasques would have been performed at the theatre." The quarto's description of the anti-masque especially notes the audience's delight with the "Countrey jollitie" and records that James himself called for an encore. An inconsistency in the designation of a character occurs in II.i-ii and is notable because it appears to reveal the authors' division of labor. The facts are briefly these. II.i is a prose scene assigned to Fletcher's collaborator, with II.ii a verse scene clearly belonging to Fletcher. In the former, the Jailer makes his first appearance and is called Iailor in the stage-direction and in the speech-prefixes. But at both his appearances in II.ii, he is called Keeper , in the speeches, entrances, and prefixes. It is quite unlikely that the Jailer and Keeper are in fact two different persons; there is no indication elsewhere in the text that Palamon and Arcite are guarded by more than one man; there is only one Jailer in the play's source, Chaucer's Knight's Tale ; and in II.iv Fletcher has the Jailer's Daughter, there so called, speak of her father as the "meane Keeper of his Prison". When the Jailer reappears in Acts IV and V, in both Fletcherian and non-Fletcherian scenes, he is regularly Iailor (or Iaylor ). The likeliest explanation is that Fletcher himself realized the discrepancy after writing II.ii. The inconsistency in character-names is accompanied by a further irregularity in the articulation of scenes i and ii, as marked in Q. The dialogue establishes that II.i is played in a garden court just below the tower where Palamon and Arcite are imprisoned. It is to this court that the Jailer, his Daughter, and her Wooer enter; during the scene, Palamon and Arcite appear—without speaking—on their prison parapet above, upon which they are observed by the others below. The scene is closed with a bare " Exeunt ". II.ii opens with another entrance for Palamon and Arcite, as follows: " Enter Palamon, and Arcite in prison ." Now, on the Jacobean stage this would in fact have been a re-entrance and as such quite anomalous. There is no indication of an intended break in the continuity of action: Q's II.i-ii must have been played as a single scene, with Palamon and Arcite remaining on the upper stage after the departure of the Jailer and his company at the " Exeunt " of scene i. But the irregularities are readily explained as consequences of divided authorship, with the shares of the two authors imperfectly joined. Had the authors composed their work in close collaboration, it is unlikely that the discrepancy in character-names or the re-entry of Palamon and Arcite would have occurred. 18 Nor would these irregularities be likely to have persisted in a fair copy made either by one of the authors or a competent theatrical scribe. The implication is that the printer's copy was the two authors' foul papers, or a very literal transcript of them, showing no editing or normalization in these scenes, at least. It also seems to be implied that the two authors wrote their shares simultaneously but without close consultation; had, for example, Shakespeare written his share (and to Fletcher's collaborator goes the initiation of all the major lines of action) from retirement in Stratford, leaving Fletcher to complete his fragments, as some scholars have postulated, we should expect Fletcher to have achieved a closer meshing of his scenes than appears here. The textual evidence thus supports the inference Sir Edmund Chambers drew from the authorial divisions: "The distribution of the Shakespearean matter shows that it is a case of collaboration and not of the completion by Fletcher of a Shakespearean fragment" ( W. S. , I, 532). If the printer's copy for Q were foul papers, it is improbable that the scene divisions, including the erroneous division at II.ii, were an original feature of the manuscript. The formal division merely reflects, of course, the apparent clearance of the stage at the end of II.i and the following entrance of Palamon and Arcite. It is also improbable that the divisions were introduced while the manuscript was in the playhouse. For one thing, there are several errors in the scene numbers, 19 whereas we would expect accuracy if the divisions were introduced for a functional purpose—for example, as a means of articulating the shares of the two authors, which, according to the pattern shown by the variant character-names for the Jailer, consisted of scenes (or groups of scenes) on separate sheets. Furthermore, it seems to have been Edward Knight's practice to delete scene divisions when they appeared in his copy, as he did when he prepared Massinger's manuscript of Believe as you List for the stage. Only in The Soddered Citizen did he allow the copy scene divisions to stand, and when parts of some scenes of that play were deleted, he was scrupulous in correcting the scene numbers accordingly. Possibly the divisions were introduced by the publisher, at the time of printing. The greater number of Waterson's plays are fully divided; of the ten plays he first published, seven are divided into acts and scenes and three into acts alone. 20 Greg suggests that the numbering of scenes was mainly a literary convention ( First Folio , p. 144). It is fruitless to guess just how the errors in the scene numbers occurred, but it is safe to assume that accuracy would not be so pressing a concern in a text prepared for printing as for performance. 21 Since playhouse manuscripts, that is, prompt books, are scrupulously accurate in the placing of speech-prefixes, 22 errors in this respect which appear in a printed text may point to foul papers as printer's copy. Some of those shown by the Kinsmen may be compositorial in origin, but at least a few probably belonged to the copy. There is one misplacing: " Emil ." is printed a line too late at II.ii.119, so that the first line of her speech is given to Arcite. There are three different repetitions of the same speech-prefix in consecutive lines, of " Per ." at III.v.97-98, of "1. Fr ." at IV.i.141-42, and of "1 . . . K ." at V.iv.38-39. All three may represent compositorial eye-skip, but for the third there is also some evidence, to be discussed below, of copy error. There are two omissions, of the Schoolmaster's prefix at III.v.137 and of Palamon's at V.iv.1. Finally, there are two redundant prefixes (i.e., two in one speech), one for the Wooer at IV.i.46 and one for Palamon at V.i.130. The former appears in Q as follows: 2. Fr . Not well?---- Wooer , No Sir not well. 45 Woo . Tis too true, she is mad. The Wooer's half line in 45 may represent a marginal addition, although, since it is metrically necessary, it is more likely that the compositor omitted it and in making the correction had to supply a new prefix in order to distinguish the Wooer's speech from the second friend's, on the same line. Palamon's extra prefix follows a stage direction which interrupts his long prayer to Venus. Attention has already been called to the appearance in Q of indefinite and permissive stage directions—in entrances calling for " attendants, &amp;c ." or ".2. or 3 wenches "—and to the marginal direction in III.vi which amounts to an explanatory gloss on the text. A further word needs to be said on the stage directions for the spectacular episodes, all of which fall in non-Fletcherian scenes. These have all the tone of authorial directions for the producer: Here they fall on their faces as formerly, and there is heard clanging of Armor, with a short Thunder as the burst of a Battaile, whereupon they all rise and bow to the Altar . (V.i.61) Still Musicke of Records . Enter Emilia in white, her haire about her shoulders, a wheaten wreath : One in white holding up her traine, her haire stucke with flowers: One before her carrying a silver Hynde, in which is conveyd Incense and sweet odours, which being set upon the Altar her maides standing a loofe, she sets fire to it: then they curtsey and kneele . (V.i.136) The direction for music may be the prompter's addition—its location suggests interpolation—but the rest is clearly the author's. It may be added to the evidence already presented that Q shows no general tendency to print entrances a few lines too early, a feature which is sometimes characteristic of prompt copy. It seems clear enough that foul papers are the ultimate basis for the quarto Kinsmen . As suggested above, however, there is some possibility of an intervening scribal transcript, in the light of recent suggestions made by Cyrus Hoy in Studies 23 and by Professor Bowers in On Editing Shakespeare , concerning the lesser incidence of Fletcher's ye 's in certain printed and manuscript texts of his plays. Briefly, Hoy conjectures that when such plays as The Woman's Prize or A Wife for a Month show far fewer ye 's than the average for Fletcher's other unaided plays, there is strong likelihood of scribal influence at work. The hypothesis is, as he points out, demonstrably true of Bonduca , which exists in two states: a private transcript from foul papers by Knight, showing 147 ye 's, and the 1647 Folio text, from the prompt book, showing 352. The Folio text must more nearly represent Fletcher's usage. It has already been observed that the Kinsmen is marked by two sets of linguistic characteristics which may be presumed authorial; one is certainly Fletcher's. In the tabulation which follows, Fletcher is assigned lines 25-28 of I.i (the attribution will be discussed below); I.iv.25-38; II.ii-vi; III.iii-vi; IV.i-ii; V.i.1-17; V.ii; and V.iv.22-38; to Fletcher's collaborator go all of Act I except the passages noted above; II.i; III.i-ii; IV.iii; V.i.18-173; and V.iii-iv, except lines noted above. These divisions give Fletcher 1517 lines, according to Kittredge's lineation, and his collaborator 1257 lines. hath has 'em them ye y' you i'th o'th Flet.: 1 26 44 9 38 8 252 10 8 non-Flet.: 15 10 11 24 2 129 12 21 other contractions in s ' (contractions of let's 24 th' (e.g. to'th , us &amp; his ; e.g., in's , th'offense, etc .) told's, between's ) Flet.: 12 4 10 non-Flet.: 27 6 3 When projected against the average Hoy gives for Fletcher's unaided plays (322), the incidence of ye 's in his parts of the Kinsmen is decidedly low. The occurrence of ' em 's, i'th' s, and o'th 's in Fletcher's parts is about what should be expected, and according to W. E. Farnham's examination of colloquial contractions in The Winter's Tale, Henry VIII , and The Two Noble Kinsmen , the rate of occurrence of these and other contractions in the non-Fletcherian scenes of the Kinsmen identifies these scenes as Shakespeare's. If scribal intervention has been at work, it has manifested itself only in a diminution of Fletcher's ye 's, as with The Woman's Prize , and even at the lower rate, ye serves to distinguish the shares of the two authors. Dr. Hoy suggests that the reduction of ye 's in the 1647 Folio text of The Woman's Prize may be attributed to Edward Knight; the Folio text appears to be based upon a prompt book which was very probably in Knight's hand. As noted above, Knight's manuscript of Bonduca also reflects a prejudice against Fletcher's ye 's. If the low rate of ye 's in the Kinsmen is indicative of scribal influence, Knight's hand might be suspected here also, were it not that the text provides other evidence—the restriction of his peculiar punctuation to the prompt annotations—indicating that Knight's work may be distinguished from the basic text. However, the manuscript Knight took in hand might well have been a transcript made by an assistant for the revival of the middle 1620's or by another book-keeper for even earlier stage use. We may recall that in addition to the original production of 1613 there appears to have been a court performance, or consideration therefor, in 1619 or 1620. A post-revival transcript is improbable; if a new prompt book were prepared for the revival in the 1620's, as seems probable, whatever manuscript Knight first took in hand would be available to serve as printer's copy and a further transcript would be unnecessary. Whether it was the foul papers themselves or a very literal transcript of them, the manuscript from which Q was printed was utilized for some kind of theatrical purpose. The annotator showed himself implicitly aware of his text's inadequacy when he provided a warning note for the entrance of Palamon and Arcite at I.iv (see above), although he failed to correct the omission of their names from the stage-direction itself. This defect, or the confusion over the Jailer's title in II.i-ii, or the inconsistencies in the number of dancers required for the morris in III.v, would render the text inconvenient, to say the least, in actual performances. In advising that the Elizabethan theatre be approached with some consideration of present-day and past theatrical experience, Professor Bowers has a suggestion which might apply in the present case: It may seem probable . . . that as an ordinary procedure once the production of the play was started with the copying of the parts, the making-up of the prompt copy would be delayed to incorporate as many as possible of the revisions decided on in the test of rehearsal . . . . The manuscript from which the parts were made would suffice for the initial ordering of the play, and indeed the book-keeper's jottings we occasionally surmise in the author's manuscript may well have been the notes made as the action was worked out during rehearsal. Presumably as scene by scene the play was perfected in rehearsal, the prompt copy might be transcribed from this manuscript. 25 Thus, initial plans for production of the Kinsmen might have been laid with whatever manuscript was at hand, with the marginal annotations representing notes the prompter made during this planning stage, perhaps before the parts were copied out, since some of the speeches would need working on before the actors could begin memorizing their lines. The notes are manifestly incomplete, but they would certainly be supplemented when the regular book was eventually constructed. To the above Professor Bowers adds, however, that If something like this were the general procedure, then it is obvious that the usual author's original drafts or very foul papers would not do, and that a temporary manuscript to serve as a basis for the copying of the parts and for guiding rehearsals would be a practical necessity before the book-keeper was ready to engage himself to the preparation of the final prompt book. A transcript which reproduces as many of the original copy's errors as are shown in Q might seem uneconomical; on the other hand, the need for legibility may have been sufficiently great to justify an intermediate transcript, even one which turned out to be as literal as the printer's copy for Q. Such a transcript might have been particularly expedient for a collaborated play in which the authors appear to have written their parts on separate groups of sheets, with, furthermore, the parts of one author bearing interpolations by his colleague (see below). At any rate, no very clear alternative to the intermediate transcript presents itself, to account for the diminished number of ye 's in Fletcher's scenes. There is the possibility that Fletcher's collaborator gave the play its final form and in the process changed most of Fletcher's ye 's to you 's; but the evidence already shown indicates that the authors wrote their scenes separately, and there is further evidence, to be discussed below, that the play went through Fletcher's hands last, not for general revision but for the insertion of additional matter; there is no evidence of the collaborator's hand in Fletcher's scenes. There is the second possibility that one of the compositors is to blame. An analysis of certain spellings and of the spacings around punctuation shows that the quarto was set by two compositors, Compositor A doing B1-C1, C2 v -E4, F3 v -G2 v , G4 v , I1-I4 v , K3, and L4 v -M2 v , and Compositor B, C1 v -C2, E4 v -F3, G3-G4, H1-H4 v , I4 v -K2, K3 v -L3 v , M3 v -M4 v , and the Prologue and Epilogue on A1 v and N1. According to this division, 25 of Fletcher's ye 's and 122 of his you 's in the text proper fall in A's stint, with 13 and 130 in B's; the ratio of ye 's to you 's in A's pages is thus about one to five, but only one to ten in B's, exclusive of Prologue and Epilogue. But even A's rate is far below Fletcher's for his unaided plays. And although there are three you 's but no ye 's in the Prologue, there are seven ye 's but no you 's in the Epilogue; the latter distribution does not show Compositor B's apparent preference for you in the play itself to have been constant. There is little doubt that the Epilogue is Fletcher's, and the Prologue is probably his as well; if the printer's copy for the dramatic text proper were a transcript, it is quite possible that the Epilogue, at least, was still printed from Fletcher's original draft. The you 's in the Prologue, however, may denote that it was set from a transcript; perhaps there is other evidence of the textual homogeneity of the Prologue and Fletcher's scenes in the occurrence in both of a rather unusual spelling, take for tack , in the phrase, take about (see line 26 of the Prologue, and III.iv.10 and IV.i.152 in two Fletcherian scenes). Some compositorial influence in the reduction of Fletcher's ye 's may be present, but it would not seem to have been especially significant. 26 There is one final possibility, which, although it rests upon an altogether undemonstrable hypothesis, does permit a rationalization of the apparently conflicting evidence of the linguistic criteria in Fletcher's scenes, on the one hand, and on the other, of the various tangles and irregularities which seem to mark foul papers. All the evidence, bibliographical as well as structural and stylistic, indicates that the two authors wrote their scenes separately, and in no very close collaboration; it is possible, therefore, that their separate sets of pages were handed in to be assembled at the playhouse, presumably by one of the authors, and that a transcript was made of Fletcher's scenes but not of his collaborator's. On the face of it, the transcription of the scenes of only one author in a collaborated play would seem somewhat unlikely, but it might be conjectured that Fletcher's pages were in such a messy state it was felt imperative to prepare clean copy of them, even though, for whatever reason, the original draft of his collaborator was accepted as it stood. It could well have been that some priority had to be established, with Fletcher's scenes being the less legible. The fact that the textual tangles and evidences of illegibility seem to be chiefly prevalent in the non-Fletcherian scenes would appear to support the hypothesis. 27 Evidence will be presented below that some of the non-Fletcherian scenes bear a few additional lines by Fletcher, to suggest that those scenes went through his hands last; but since his interpolations are relatively short, they are not necessarily inconsistent with the procedure sketched above; there is nothing to indicate any general revision upon Fletcher's part. The whole play would almost have to have been put together by one of the authors; Fletcher's treatment of his collaborator's scenes suggests that the responsibility of assemblage was his, and, as conjectured above, the task may have been performed at the play-house, after both parts had been submitted to the company. The interpolations could have been introduced at the same time. If some such procedure as that described above were followed, the chief desideratum would appear to have been simply clean copy, in accord with Professor Bowers's hypothesis, for some discrepancies remain in Fletcher's scenes—i.e., the variant character-name for the Jailer in II.ii (although it may have been the scribe who later regularized his title), or the confusion over the number of wenches for the morris dance in III.v. So, while it cannot be demonstrated, the transcription of Fletcher's scenes provides an explanation for the diminished ye 's and for the signs of foul papers: the preservation in Q of various marks of jointure between the scenes of the two collaborators and the tangles and irregularities which are more numerous in the scenes given to Shakespeare. But whether the printer's copy was an intermediate transcript, foul papers, or a mixture of the two, it seems clear enough that foul papers are the ultimate basis for Q. Differences of style or metre in scattered passages in certain of the non-Fletcherian scenes have led a number of critics to suppose that such scenes had been reworked by Fletcher. Thus Chambers ( W. S. , I, 532) found no evidence of revision but suggested that "in fitting the scenes together, Fletcher may possibly have added a few lines to Shakespeare's." For at least one of the interpolated passages Chambers cited, some visible "seams" remain in Q, to provide further evidence of the author's method of collaboration. The passage is V.iv.22-38; 28 it presents no conclusive linguistic or metrical evidence for or against Fletcher's authorship, but the exaggerated courage Palamon displays in it is strongly suggestive of Fletcher, and it incidentally resolves the sub-plot involving the Jailer's Daughter, the development of most of which had been in Fletcher's hands. There is no mark of textual disarrangement at line 22, but at the other end there are two significant features. Q prints lines 21-23 and 37-40 as follows: 3. K. Come? who begins? 21 Pal . Ev'n he that led you to this Banket, shall Taste to you all: ah ha my Friend, my Friend, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Pal . Adiew; and let my life be now as short, As my leave taking. Lies on the Blocke. 37 1. K . Leade couragiou[s] Cosin. 1. 2. K . Wee'l follow cheerefully. A great noise within crying, run, save hold: Enter in hast a Messenger. Mess . Hold, hold, O hold, hold, hold. Line 39 is not only metrically defective but the speech-prefixes show a manifest error; the dramatist hardly intended that the first knight should answer himself. But if lines 22-38 are excised, as they may be without destroying the sense of what is left, then the first and second knights' declaration in line 39, "Wee'l follow cheerefully", becomes a natural answer to the third knight's question in line 21, "Come? who begins?" Significantly, the question and answer make up one full line. An alternative explanation for the confusion in speech-prefixes based on compositorial misreading must ascribe the apparent relation between divided authorship and textual irregularity to sheer coincidence. It is more probable that the repetition of prefixes is an inadvertent seam resulting from an imperfect fusing of Fletcher's addition with an originally non-Fletcherian scene. It would appear that after the initial draft was complete, Fletcher went through his collaborator's scenes, or some of them, not to effect a thoroughgoing revision (unless he subsequently prepared a fair copy, for which there is no evidence), but here and there to insert slight additions, making little or no attempt to remove the marks of jointure. One of the other passages Chambers cites—I.i.25-28—is also marked by defective lineation, as is a third if its line divisions are slightly adjusted. Chambers put the interpolation at I.iv.32-38; line 24, however, is a short line followed by a full line beginning a new speech, and if we allow the addition to have begun at line 25, it can then include a passage which I think has a Fletcherian ring: "Yet they breathe And haue the name of men" (ll. 27-28). Thorndike thought Fletcher had retouched 28-49 of this scene—that is, to the end of the scene. If Fletcher's work extends that far, the textual confusion at 40-45 may be related to his intervention, but in what fashion it is impossible to say, except that in this case Fletcher must have cancelled the original ending of his collaborator or worked his additions into his collaborator's lines so that they cannot now be distinguished. The division I have adopted, 25-38, is a somewhat unsatisfactory compromise. Finally, Chambers and every recent commentator has assigned V.i.1-17 to Fletcher; the number of ' em 's and ye 's is evidence of his work, although there is no disarrangement of text or lineation here to mark off the interpolation. The quarto provides a little other evidence of alteration, but it is probably not authorial. It lies in two questions of plus or minus, with probability pointing to the latter, at least for the second instance. The first occurs in IV.ii, which opens with a long soliloquy by Emilia. The initial entrance reads, " Enter Emilia alone, with 2. Pictures ", but her speech is closed with a second entrance, " Enter Emil. and Gent ." The second example occurs in IV.iii, where two exits are marked for the Jailer's Daughter, at lines 43 and 63, both on sig. K2 v . The exits just bracket her vehement and no doubt censorable denunciation of adulterous courtiers and her cynical comment on proud ladies. In each case we can only guess whether the duplications represent addition or deletion. The whole scene in which Emilia's soliloquy appears is unquestionably Fletcher's, so if there has been addition it was Fletcher's; on the other hand, in 54 lines of soliloquy Emilia protests too much, so that deletion is equally possible, by Knight or any one else through whose hands the manuscript passed in the playhouse. On stylistic and linguistic grounds IV.iii appears to be homogeneous, and it is probable that the first exit for the Jailer's Daughter shows deletion to avert censorship. Except for the passage cited above, the play shows no evidence of general censorship, although, as Greg warned, "the presence or absence of profanity cannot be regarded as affording altogether reliable evidence respecting the nature and date of the manuscript that served as copy for a printed text" ( First Folio , p. 152). The Two Noble Kinsmen is not a heavily profane play, but it does contain a few oaths with which Sir Henry Herbert might have taken exception—e.g., "Marry," "god's lyd," "Faith," numerous invocations of God and Gods, and even one affirmation by "wine and bread"—and if we may judge from his practice in Barnavelt , Buc would have objected to the courtier reference in IV.iii. For what it is worth, then, such evidence points to an unrevised draft or at least an unexpurgated transcript; it also points back to the date of original composition rather than revision or transcription for the revival of 1625-26. One might also note that Knight's copy of The Honest Man's Fortune , made within a year or so of the Kinsmen 's revival, shows fairly extensive purgation, particularly of such obvious expletives as "God", in which the Kinsmen abounds. There is one other area of evidence which may have some bearing on the nature of the copy. In The Shakespeare First Folio , Sir Walter Greg wrote, "if we find any considerable number of eccentric or archaic spellings in a print, the likelihood is great that it was set from the author's own manuscript and not from a scribal copy" (p. 148). I should not want to say that a "considerable number" of eccentric spellings occur in The Two Noble Kinsmen , but I have the impression that the texture is more archaic in the scenes ascribed to Shakespeare. The list which follows is drawn from his scenes and also represents spellings which are paralleled in various texts of his acknowledged plays, thought to have been printed from authorial manuscripts: angle (i.e., angel ), Asprayes, boudge, cease (i.e., seize ), Cizard, cizd, mervaile, right (i.e., rite ), and Wrinching (i.e., rinsing ). In addition, I conjecture the anomalous form, a eleven , at I.iii.54, to be a compositorial misreading (or "normalization") of an original copy spelling, a leven . Spellings of eleven with a occur, of course, in a number of the Shakespeare good quartos and in Addition D of Sir Thomas More . In the Fletcherian scenes I note only stoa (i.e., stow ), aborne (i.e., auburn ), and take (i.e., tack , in both Prologue and text). I had hoped that a tabulation of various morphological groups according to the authorial divisions might be possible, but any significant variation which might have once appeared seems to have been almost hopelessly obscured by the compositorial pattern. In several classes the distribution of variant forms is disproportionate for one author or another but not sufficiently so to permit certainty that one of the compositors has not intervened. For example, the ratio of spellings in - nck and - nk in the non-Fletcherian scenes is 8:16, but in the Fletcherian scenes, 3:48; however, in the second half of the text only one - nck spelling occurs. For various classes of elisions, the patterns may be authorial; of elisions of e in verbals ending - en , the distribution between non-Fletcherian and Fletcherian scenes is six to three; of e in verbals ending - er , eight to zero; of e in various nouns and adjectives with - er -, nine to three, all instances in Fletcherian scenes being wondrous ; and finally, the elided spellings medcine and heav'nly both appear in non-Fletcherian scenes. Save for the diminished ye 's in Fletcher's scenes, the accumulation of evidence is, it seems to me, strong for foul papers. The hypothesis of mixed copy described above offers one resolution to the apparent dilemma; otherwise, we may choose between annotated foul papers and an annotated intermediate transcript when we pay our money. There are arguments on both sides. But even if it be concluded that a scribal transcript has intervened between the author's original draft and the printed text, the preservation in the quarto of so many signs of jointure and divided authorship would still warrant the inferences which have been drawn concerning the authors' method of collaboration. Not only the authorial tests but bibliographical evidence indicates that they divided their work by scenes (or structural dramatic units, since Q's II.i-ii really constitute a single scene) and wrote their shares concurrently, for, as suggested above, Fletcher would hardly have called his tower guard "Keeper" if he had just read his collaborator's scenes and there found the title "Iailor". Presumably they worked from a scenario or some sort of outline; analysis of the plot shows that each must have understood the essential outlines of the whole play from the very beginning. The Jailer-Keeper confusion is not overly serious, but it is just the kind of discrepancy which might have occurred had the authors divided the scenes between themselves and then begun writing their respective shares simultaneously but in no very close collaboration. Then, while Fletcher seems to have given the text a final reworking, his revisory attentions appear haphazard and incomplete: they amounted only to the addition of some new matter, with a number of irregularities, some quite obvious, left untouched. It is quite possible that the play had to be written and put together under some pressure, so that it might be on the stage before the festivities attendant upon the wedding of Elizabeth and Frederick were over—very likely while the morris dance it borrowed from Beaumont's Masque was still fresh. The great difficulty in the acceptance of Shakespeare's authorship is the inferiority of the scenes given to him, especially in characterization and thought, in comparison with his known work. Attention has already been called to the rather marked difference as to state of finish between the Shakespearean and Fletcherian parts of the play. The textual tangles and general impression of carelessness, the evidence that the authors did not work in especially close collaboration, and the evidence that it was Fletcher who gave Shakespeare's scenes their final touches, all suggest that Shakespeare simply did not give the play the thought and attention which might have satisfied those who reject the attribution of the quarto title-page. 29 "Foul papers," therefore, may lie at the heart of the authorial problem.</field>

Here the directions are clearly authorial: e.g., " Ang. makes discontented signes ", or " Maid lais her finger crosse her mouth to him ".

Like the example given above, several appear to have been added to original directions; see the direction for " Still Musicke of Records ", shown below. 11 It may be pertinent to point out that of eight King's men's plays first published by Waterson, three show some signs of playhouse origin, in addition to the Kinsmen . They are Massinger's The Unnatural Combat (1639), D'Avenant's The Cruel Brother (1630), and Fletcher's Monsieur Thomas (1639). 12 On Editing Shakespeare and the Elizabethan Dramatists (1955), p. 21. 13 The Shakespeare First Folio , p. 142. 14 Op. cit. , p. 21. 15 In the masque, the He-Fool and He-Baboon are different characters. The quarto Kinsmen provides for a total of six males: the four countrymen, the " Bavian " or Baboon, and the taborer. It has been argued by various critics that in the play the Bavian and the Fool are the same, there being thus only five male dancers and the taborer. Cf . Helge Kökeritz, "The Beast-Eating Clown, The Two Noble Kinsmen , 3.5.131," Modern Language Notes , LXI (1946), 532-535. But this reckoning leaves one of the women uncoupled: either Q's stage-direction erred in the number of countrymen supposed to be present, as it manifestly did for the wenches; or one of the women did not have a partner after all, which renders absurd the Schoolmaster's command to couple; or the taborer danced, which is hardly likely. 16 John Stowe, Annales, or a Generall Chronicle of England , continued and augmented by Edmund Howes (1631), p. [914], sig. 3H2 v . 17 The Influence of Beaumont and Fletcher on Shakspere (1901), p. 46. 18 The scene divisions are removed in the editions of Weber, Dyce, and Skeat. Other modern editors get around the problem by a series of scene locations which would be feasible in the movies but hardly on the Jacobean stage: thus, II.i is placed in "a garden, with a castle in the background", with Palamon and Arcite entering "at a window, above"; then II.ii is laid in "a room in the prison", with Emilia and her woman entering "below". All this would require that in II.i the audience's point of view be outside looking at the garden and the prison, but for II.ii inside the prison looking out at the garden below. Obviously, the audience's orientation must be the same in both scenes: outside the garden and prison tower. 19 I.i is not numbered and Acts II and III are misnumbered as follows: II.i, ii, iii, iv, iv, vi; III.i, ii, iii, iv, vi, vii. So far as can be determined from an analysis of the play's structure, the errors do not seem to have resulted from an alteration of the play's original order of scenes. 20 The three are D'Avenant's The Cruel Brother and The Just Italian , both King's plays published in 1630, and The Valiant Scot , an anonymous "Red Bull-King's" play published in 1637. 21 Since the quarto was set up by two compositors, the possibility arises that the errors came about as one compositor left off and the second took over, getting mixed up in the count in the process. But their work was not so divided as to make this likely. 22 Cf. W. W. Greg, Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses . . . Commentary (1931), p. 207. 23 "The Shares of Fletcher and his Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon (I)," Studies in Bibliography , VIII (1956), 138-142. 24 The count is my own but the tabulation is based upon various tests first developed by R. B. McKerrow, ed., The Spanish Curate , in the Variorum Beaumont and Fletcher, vol. II (1905); A. H. Thorndike, op. cit. ; W. E. Farnham, "Colloquial Contractions in Beaumont, Fletcher, Massinger, and Shakespeare as a Test of Authorship," PMLA , XXXI (1916), 326-359; and A. C. Partridge, The Problem of "Henry VIII" Reopened (1949); see also Cyrus Hoy's article in Studies . 25 Op. cit. , n. 8, p. 113. 26 It may be instructive to glance at the other Fletcher texts printed by Thomas Cotes, whose shop produced the Kinsmen . It was Cotes, of course, who printed the second Shakespeare Folio of 1632; his reprint therein of Henry VIII reproduces all the ye 's from the First Folio text, in the scenes assigned to Fletcher. In 1639 he printed Wit Without Money , a play traditionally attributed to Fletcher alone, but one which, because of the linguistic pattern it exhibits, Dr. Hoy suggests was revised or rewritten by another hand. Wit Without Money shows only one ye , printed as yeare ; the form may mean that while a systematic effort was made to remove Fletcher's ye 's, in this instance a copy ye are was passed over because it was misread as year ( e ). But otherwise, the linguistic pattern is pretty clearly Fletcher's, even to the consistent spelling ' um for ' em , a form which Dr. Hoy cites as Fletcher's. Cotes's final Fletcher quarto is The Night Walker , printed in 1640. There is external evidence that it was revised by Shirley in 1633, and the greatly reduced number of ye 's the play shows may undoubtedly be attributed to Shirley's hand; furthermore, a number of spellings which appear to be Shirley's, such as wonnot or wo'not , are distributed throughout the text. The known fact of Shirley's revision and the additional fact that neither Wit Without Money nor The Night Walker were King's plays make it impossible, of course, that the quartos could have had a common scribal background. The variations in the linguistic patterns of the three plays also remove the printing house as a likely factor in the diminution of Fletcher's ye 's. 27 Most of the play's unusual or archaic spellings also appear in the non-Fletcherian scenes; see below. 28 Actually, Chambers puts the passage at lines 23-38, rather than 22-38. The points of division Chambers indicates apparently go back to William Spalding's "Letter on Shakspere's Authorship of The Two Noble Kinsmen " of 1833, reprinted in Transactions of the New Shakspere Society , Series VIII, No. 1 (1876), 1-109, and Harold Littledale's introduction to his edition of the play, also published in the Transactions , Series II, No. 15 (1885), 9-82. Line 23 is the second line of a new speech, and Spalding put the point of division in the very middle of the line without explaining why; since there is nothing particularly un-Fletcherian about line 22, there is no reason why Fletcher should not be given the whole of the speech with which the passage begins, and, as is shown below, there is reason to assign it all to him. 29 In an article on the authorship of the play which appeared in Modern Philology , XXXVI (1939), 255-276, Theodore Spencer also suggests that the disappointing qualities of Shakespeare's scenes are due to the author's lack of attentive care, although he attributes the lapse to psychological causes as well as the company's pressure: "It is the dramatic writing of a man to whom action has lost importance, but who is trying to recapture, for the immediate necessity of writing a money-making play, the devices and the lost enthusiasm of a forgotten intensity. It is the writing of a man who has come out on the other side of human experience, and who, looking back, can no longer be interested in what he has once seen so vividly and so passionately felt" (p. 264).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Shares of Fletcher and his Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon (III) by Cyrus Hoy *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BEAUMONT'S WORK IS PRESENT IN TWELVE PLAYS of the canon, but the extent of his share in each of these varies widely. At the one extreme, there is The Knight of the Burning Pestle , a play which I regard as wholly his. Second only to this is The Woman Hater , in its original state almost certainly a product of Beaumont's sole authorship, but revised in five scenes of its extant text by Fletcher. Then there is The Noble Gentleman , another apparently Beaumontian original extensively revised by Fletcher some twenty years after its composition. And after these must be reckoned the famous trio of Philaster, The Maid's Tragedy , and A King and no King , in all of which (but to a less extent in the first than in the last two) Beaumont's share is much the greater, and his hand is the controlling one. In Cupid's Revenge and Love's Pilgrimage the shares of the two collaborators are roughly equal, and in the collaborations with Fletcher and Massinger, Beggars' Bush and Thierry and Theodoret , Beaumont's work accounts for approximately a third of the whole. But with The Coxcomb and The Scornful Lady we have reached the other extreme, for Fletcher's contribution is here the major one, and Beaumont's share in comparison is small indeed. To distinguish, on the basis of linguistic evidence, the respective shares of the Beaumont-Fletcher collaborations is not always easy or possible. Only in Love's Pilgrimage , the revised scenes of The Woman Hater , and the two collaborations of Beaumont, Fletcher, and Massinger ( Beggars' Bush and Thierry and Theodoret ) does the Fletcherian ye occur to such an extent as to point immediately to the scenes of his authorship. In the chief of Fletcher's collaborations with Beaumont, ye is rarely found, with the result that such plays as The Coxcomb, Cupid's Revenge, A King and no King, The Maid's Tragedy , and Philaster afford no scope for applying what has hitherto been the most successful linguistic test for Fletcher's authorship. All five of these plays have evidently been given their final form by Beaumont, and one can only assume that whatever instances of ye they might once have displayed have been almost wholly removed in the process of stylistic revision. If one is to judge from The Knight of the Burning Pestle and The Woman Hater (excluding, of course, the scenes revised by Fletcher), ye is a form which Beaumont almost never employed. It seems reasonable to assume that, if Beaumont did re-work his finished collaborations with Fletcher, the Fletcherian ye would have been one of the first linguistic forms to be eliminated in the interest of a single harmony of language. How conspicuous Fletcher's use of ye could be in a play principally of Beaumont's authorship can be seen from the revised scenes of The Woman Hater , probably the first play on which the two dramatists worked together. It may perhaps point to Beaumont's awareness of this that, thereafter, ye has come to be all but banished from Fletcher's share of their most notable collaborations. With the evidence of ye no longer available, one comes to consider the evidence of such other linguistic forms as hath and doth, 'em and them, i'th, o'th' , and the rest. As has been seen, these have often served to distinguish the work of Fletcher and Massinger even when the evidence of ye has been obscured, for each dramatist can be shown to have had fairly distinct preferences which tended to govern the use of such forms in his work. In the case of the Beaumont-Fletcher collaborations, even evidence of this sort avails nothing, for on the whole there is little if anything to distinguish Beaumont's preferences among such forms from Fletcher's. In the Beaumont-Fletcher collaborations, i'th', o'th', 'em, h'as, 's for his , and similar contractions can be found alike in scenes by both dramatists. The whole matter is further complicated by the fact that Beaumont's linguistic practices are themselves so widely divergent as to make it all but impossible to predict what they will be from one play to another. Thus The Woman Hater can show a strong preference for them instead of 'em , while Cupid's Revenge and A King and no King show a reverse preference. Hath and doth can occur 86 and 22 times respectively in The Woman Hater , and but 7 and 3 times respectively in A King and no King. I'th' may appear 7 times in Beaumont's share of Cupid's Revenge , and but once in the whole of The Maid's Tragedy . The variety of contracted forms to be found in Beaumont's work is enormous, but one would be rash indeed to attempt to formulate from these a pattern of linguistic preferences that would purport to represent his language practices, for no single form is to be found at a sustained rate of occurrence throughout his work. His use of such forms as ye , o'th' , and 's for his is a case in point: these he neither employs regularly and to a fairly consistent degree, as does Fletcher, nor does he avoid using them altogether, as does Massinger. His linguistic "preferences"—if they can be termed such—are, in a word, nothing if not eclectic, and the quality of his writing gains accordingly, for his language is flexible and various. But it is this very protean character which makes it, in the end, quite impossible to establish for Beaumont a neat pattern of linguistic preferences that will serve as a guide to identifying his work wherever it might appear. Beggars' Bush Beaumont : II; V, 1, 2b (from entrance of Hubert to the end). Fletcher : III; IV. Massinger : I; V, 2a (to entrance of Hubert). In addition to the text of the first folio, the play is preserved in a scribal transcript in the Lambarde Collection at the Folger Shakespeare Library. Dr. R. C. Bald suggests that the manuscript, the work of the scribe of Aglaura , was commissioned by a private patron of the drama; on the evidence of the stage directions which it exhibits, the manuscript clearly derives from a theatrical prompt-book. 1 This seems to have been abridged somewhat for acting purposes, for the folio contains some thirty-five lines which the manuscript omits. The linguistic evidence to be derived from the two texts is sufficiently of a piece. Though ye occurs somewhat more frequently in the manuscript than in the folio (191 instances in the manuscript to 158 in the folio), such divergence as is to be marked in the distribution of other language forms is hardly greater than what might be expected to exist between two texts independently transmitted. The important thing for the purpose of authorial evidence is the manner in which identical language forms appear at a virtually identical rate of occurrence at identical points in the two texts. In both texts, three separate linguistic patterns can be distinguished. The most readily discernible of these is to be traced through Acts III and IV; of the 158 occurrences of ye in the folio text, 152 are found here. When, in this portion of the play, one finds no occurrence of hath (the only acts in which the form does not appear), and but a single use of them as opposed to 28 instances of the contracted ' em , the share of Fletcher is clear enough. In contrast to the linguistic pattern that emerges from Acts III and IV is that which emerges from Act I (and which can be discerned again at the beginning of V,ii). Here ye does not occur in the folio text (though the form appears 4 times in the manuscript). Both manuscript and folio exhibit 7 occurrences of hath ; and while, in Act I of the folio and manuscript, the contracted ' em appears but twice and a single time respectively, the expanded them is found 16 times. In neither text is any use made throughout the first act of such contractions as i'th', o'th', h'as, or ' s for his . The linguistic pattern here, so markedly opposed to the Fletcherian one, is that of Massinger. The third linguistic pattern that is present in Beggars' Bush can be traced throughout Act II, in V,i, and in the latter part of V,ii. These scenes have in common a number of linguistic features which sets them apart from the rest of the play. They exhibit an occasional use of ye (6 instances in the folio, 15 in the manuscript) that is enough to provide a contrast with the Massingerian scenes where, in the folio at least, the form does not appear; 2 at the same time, the use of ye in pattern number three never approaches the high occurrence of the form in the scenes of Fletcher's authorship. Of the play's 5 occurrences of doth , 4 appear in Act II and accordingly mark pattern number three with their presence. While the Fletcherian scenes show a decided preference for ' em to them , and the Massingerian scenes show an exactly opposite preference, the tendency in pattern number three, though there is an evident preference for the contracted form, falls somewhere between these opposing practices; there them occurs 9 times in both texts, while ' em is used 16 times in the folio, 15 times in the manuscript. In its use of such contractions as i'th', o'th ', and the like, pattern number three does not differ in any distinguishable way from the Fletcherian one, though since these language forms do not have any significant part in the pattern of Massinger, the contrast on this score at least is sufficiently marked. Perhaps the single linguistic feature which serves most strikingly to distinguish pattern number three from the other two is the use of the contraction ha ' for have . In the folio text this is found 12 times (9 times in the manuscript) in Acts II and V, but not elsewhere in the play. It occurs in none of the unaided plays of Massinger, and in the unaided plays of Fletcher it occurs but 4 times in three plays (twice in The Loyal Subject , once each in Monsieur Thomas and The Island Princess ). To judge from its appearance in the plays that follow, it is a contraction that might be reasonably associated with the work of Beaumont, with whom pattern number three of Beggars' Bush is to be identified. And yet to speak of a linguistic pattern for Beaumont is something of an anomaly, as has already been observed. That something approaching a pattern of linguistic preferences can be derived from his share of Beggars' Bush is possible simply because the individual features of the patterns of Fletcher and Massigner have been preserved in so evident a degree. When the Fletcherian ye gives way, and Beaumont refrains from his use of hath and doth , nothing remains to distinguish the linguistic practices of the one from the linguistic practices of the other. In the table below, the occurrence of the relevant linguistic forms in both the folio and the manuscript texts of Beggars' Bush is given. Figures based on the manuscript are enclosed in square brackets. The Coxcomb Beaumont : I, 4; II, 4; IV, 1, 3, 7; V. Fletcher : I, 1-3, 5; II, 1, 3; III, 1-2; IV, 2, 4-6, 8. Beaumont and Fletcher : I, 6; II,2 ; III, 3. The prologue indicates that the play was revised when it was re-staged some years after the original production. Whether such evidences of Fletcher's linguistic pattern as ever existed in the text were lost then, or whether they had already been removed by Beaumont in his customary practice of giving the final form to his collaborations with Fletcher it is impossible to say. At any rate, Fletcher's usual language preferences are not to be found in any very noticeable degree in the extant text. Ye occurs but 7 times in the entire play, though it should be pointed out that all instances of the form appear in scenes in which Fletcher's hand can be traced. The Fletcherian scenes display as well 9 occurrences of 'em to an equal number of them , 9 instances of i'th' , 3 of o'th ', 2 of h'as , 2 of 's for his . Hath is found here 5 times, doth twice. The Beaumont portion shows a decided preference for them (used 26 times) to the contracted 'em (used 5 times). Here i'th' occurs thrice, o'th' not at all; there are single occurrences of 's for his , and h'as . And in Beaumont's share hath is found 4 times, doth 3 times. In dividing the play between the two dramatists I have been guided in part by metrical considerations, though since a large part of the text is in prose, and since verse—when it occurs—is often printed as prose, even this criterion is not so serviceable as one could wish. In the main I have regarded all scenes involving Viola and her manifold woes as the work of Beaumont, while I consider Fletcher to be largely responsible for the main plot concerning the coxcombly Antonio, his wife Maria, and his friend Mercury whom he is so outrageously eager to enstate as his wife's lover. Viola is as tearful and as patiently self-sacrificing a maiden as Beaumont ever drew, and she has her place in a gallery that includes Aspatia in The Maid's Tragedy , Bellerio in Philaster , and Urania in Cupid's Revenge . But even an attribution on the basis of the play's two plots will not completely hold, for Beaumont is almost certainly responsible for the entire fifth act, which brings both to their resolution. At the same time, this may be still another example of the kind of close collaboration between the two dramatists that is evident elsewhere in the play. One instance of this is I, 6; Viola's speech which opens the scene, and all of her brief lines thereafter, are surely the work of Beaumont, but the remainder of the scene involving Richardo and his drunken companions is, with almost equal surety, the work of Fletcher. Similarly with II, 2: Viola's first speech I regard as Beaumont's work, and the same I hold to be true of her brief soliloquy after the exit of the Tinker and Dorothy. Other than this, I regard the scene as Fletcher's. And though III, 3 is, I think, essentially Beaumont's, there are traces of Fletcher toward the end, as in such a line as Nan's "doe you know what a wake is? we have mighty cheer then, and such a coyle, 'twould blesse ye." There is no doubt that the play represents, in its original form at least, a Beaumont-Fletcher collaboration. The extent to which it was subsequently revised will probably never be satisfactorily determined. Oliphant believed the reviser to have been Massinger, and divided the play among the three dramatists. I find nothing in the play that points even remotely to Massinger, and since his work elsewhere is so very distinctive it is hard to imagine he is present here. Cupid's Revenge Beaumont : I, 1, 3; II, 1-2, 4-5; III, 1-2; IV, 1, 5; V, 1. Fletcher : I, 2, 4; II, 3, 6; III, 3-4; IV, 2-4; V, 2-3. The linguistic evidence that emerges from the play gives no very clear indication of the respective shares of the two dramatists. Ye is found but a total of 13 times, though each time it occurs in a scene which I assign to Fletcher. But contractions which have tended to distinguish Fletcher's linguistic pattern from that of Massinger are of no avail in separating his work from Beaumont's, in this play at least. 'Em is used 16 times in Fletcher's share of the play, and 19 times in Beaumont's. The Fletcherian portion contains 3 instances of i'th' , but that of Beaumont contains 7 occurrences of the form. The shares of both contain single occurrences of o'th' . And while 's for his is found twice in scenes by Fletcher, it appears 8 times in scenes by Beaumont. Finally, the occurrence of hath and doth is not here confined to the share of a single collaborator. In Beaumont's portion, hath is found once, doth twice. In Fletcher's share, there are 5 instances of hath , one of doth . The only linguistic form of any significance which does not occur equally in scenes by both dramatists is the contraction ha' , all 7 instances of which appear in Beaumont's portion of the play. Two inferences are to be drawn from the linguistic evidence afforded by Cupid's Revenge . The first is the natural one that the play has been given its final form by Beaumont, who in the process has eliminated most of Fletcher's ye' s. The second is of even greater significance: that Beaumont's language preferences are not essentially different from Fletcher's, and that the contractions ( 'em , i'th' , o'th' , 's for his , and the like) which have often served to separate Fletcher's work from Massinger's can be expected to appear alike in both portions of a play of Beaumont and Fletcher's joint authorship. A King and no King Beaumont : I; II; III; IV, 4; V, 2, 4. Fletcher : IV, 1-3; V, 1, 3. The play is largely the work of Beaumont, who seems to be responsible as well for the final form of the whole. Ye is found but 7 times in the entire play: 4 times in scenes by Beaumont, and thrice in Fletcher's V, 3. Apart from this, the only vestige of Fletcher's customary linguistic practices consists in the fact that, though hath and doth are used respectively 7 and 3 times in Beaumont's share of the play, neither form occurs in the Fletcherian portion. Fletcher's usual preference for the contraction 'em (here spelled throughout the play 'um ), to them is evident, but a similar preference is evident in Beaumont's share as well. The play, indeed, furnishes striking proof that Beaumont's language preferences (apart from his avoidance of ye ) are not essentially different from Fletcher's. In the five scenes of Fletcher's authorship, 'um is used 10 times, them 4 times, i'th' 3 times, o'th' 4 times, h'as 2 times, and 's for his a single time. There is little enough to distinguish the Fletcherian usage from the occurrence of the same forms in Beaumont's share, where 'um appears 39 times, them 17 times, i'th' 5 times, o'th' 2 times, h'as a single time, and 's for his 4 times. Fletcher's extra-metrical verse serves, on the whole, to set the five scenes of his authorship apart from the rest of the play, though one of these (V, 3) is almost entirely prose, and prose is to be found elsewhere in his share, most notably in the final half of V, 1. The Knight of the Burning Pestle Beaumont : I-V. Though one should, perhaps, be reluctant to deprive Fletcher of a share in this, the most celebrated play in the canon, I find no shred of evidence for assuming his work to be present here. Even granting Beaumont's practice of giving the final form to his collaborations with Fletcher, the evidence —linguistic, metrical, syntactic—which the play affords gives no valid basis for assuming a theory of dual authorship. Linguistically, at least, the play is very much of a piece, and the linguistic pattern which emerges from it is at one with all that we know of the pattern of Beaumont. Ye occurs but 3 times throughout the play. There are 37 instances of hath , 12 of doth . For 9 occurrences of 'em (and 2 of the unusual 'am , which occurs as well in The Woman Hater ), there are 36 of them . The contraction ha' , elsewhere associated with Beaumont, appears here 13 times. As for the contractions i'th' (here used 8 times), o'th' (used twice), h'as (used once), 's for his (used 7 times): it has been already noted that there is little if anything to distinguish Beaumont's use of such forms from Fletcher's. If Fletcher's work is present, it is present to a very negligible degree indeed, and whatever distinctive features it may have possessed have been brought by Beaumont to a thorough conformity with the texture of the whole. In all essentials, the play is the product of a single dramatist. Love's Pilgrimage Beaumont : I, 1a (lines 1-23), 1c (line 75 to entrance of Lazaro); IV; V. Fletcher : I, 2; II; III. Adapted from Jonson : I, 1b (lines 24-74), 1d (from Lazaro's entrance to the end). The play's opening scene incorporates two sizeable passages (of 21 and 111 lines respectively) from Jonson's The New Inn , and the explanations for how this has come about have been numerous and various. Jonson's play was first produced, and immediately denounced by the first-night audience, in January 1629. On 16 September 1635, Herbert records in his Office-Book the receipt of one pound "from the King's Company, for the renewing of Love's Pilgrimage " ( Herbert , p. 36). Since this was Herbert's usual fee for re-licensing an old play to which new scenes had been added, 3 the supposition is that Love's Pilgrimage had undergone alterations. It seems reasonable to assume that these consisted, in part at least, in adapting the two passages from Jonson's hapless comedy into the old Beaumont and Fletcher play that was about to be revived. So disastrous had been the reception of The New Inn that the play must have represented a total financial loss to the King's Company, and one might speculate that the actors would have been ready enough to salvage from it anything that could be put to use in refurbishing an old play for revival. The discussion that has raged over the reproduction of the passages in the two plays has, of course, been chiefly concerned with whether they were in fact transferred from The New Inn at the revival of Love's Pilgrimage in 1635, or whether Jonson himself had lifted them from Beaumont and Fletcher's earlier work. Since both Beaumont and Fletcher were dead by the time Jonson wrote The New Inn , neither can be charged with stealing from Jonson, and if the two passages stood in the original version of Love's Pilgrimage , then Jonson must be judged guilty of appropriating them for his own. Oliphant ( The Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher , p. 439) advances an elaborate theory which would suppose Jonson to have commenced, "probably about the time of Fletcher's death [August 1625]," a revision of Love's Pilgrimage , but one which was never carried beyond the first half of I, 1, When, according to Oliphant, Jonson began The New Inn several years later, he reclaimed some of his lines that had gone into his revision of the earlier play. But since Oliphant considers the second of the two passages in question to be the work of Fletcher, he would contend that Jonson lifted not only some of his own lines, but carried with him as well "the only piece of Fletcher's work he had left in the only scene he had meddled with." Though Oliphant "fanc[ied] that [no] other explanation has been put forward that satisfies so many of the conditions," his theory is rather less than credible. Herford and Simpson, in their edition of Jonson's Works (II, 198 ff.), present as convincing proof as is likely to be advanced that the passages in The New Inn are the original ones. Since the authors of Love's Pilgrimage were dead at the date of Jonson's play, the passages could only have been introduced into their work by a later hand, most probably at the time the play was re-licensed in 1635. That the play represents an original Beaumont-Fletcher collaboration is, I think, certain. About Fletcher's presence, there can be no doubt at all. The occurrence of ye clearly charts the extent of his share, from I, 2 through the end of Act III. The linguistic pattern that emerges from these scenes is as distinctly Fletcherian as any to be found in his unaided work, or the most readily distinguishable of his collaborations with Massinger. Ye in the Fletcherian scenes occurs 170 times, and is found but twice elsewhere in the play. The Fletcherian portion displays as well his usual linguistic preferences: 'em occurs 35 times, them not at all. There are 3 instances of i'th' , 5 of o'th' , 1 of 's for his. Hath is used but twice; doth does not occur. Beaumont's share is distinguished from Fletcher's first of course by the absence of ye , which, as has been said, occurs but twice in scenes assigned to him. But it is worth noting that here, as in Beggars' Bush and Cupid's Revenge , all instances of the contraction ha' appear in Beaumont's portion of the play. Finally, the 9 instances of hath in the Beaumont scenes afford something of a contrast with the infrequent use of the form in scenes by Fletcher. But the linguistic pattern that emerges for Beaumont here displays, on the whole, a wide variety of contractions used at a rate that can seldom be distinguished from their occurrence in Fletcher. Thus we find in Beaumont's share of Love's Pilgrimage 32 instances of 'em (with 5 of them ), 4 of i'th' , 2 of o'th' , 3 of h'as , and 3 of 's for his . The use of such contractions as these in the two shares of Love's Pilgrimage but serves further to bear out the truth of what was said regarding the use of such contractions in Cupid's Revenge : that they are of no value as evidence for distinguishing the work of Beaumont and Fletcher. That the Fletcherian ye should be preserved to the extent that it is in Love's Pilgrimage is itself remarkable in a play of which Beaumont was part-author; it is the more so in view of the fact that the play has undergone some degree of alteration. The presence of ye would seem to indicate that here Beaumont is not responsible for the play's final form. It may indicate as well that the alterations of 1635 did not go much beyond the Jonsonian insertions in I, 1. The ye' s of the Fletcherian scenes, at any rate, have not suffered the usual reduction that elsewhere has been found to be the inevitable consequence of a non-authorial revision of Fletcher's work. The Maid's Tragedy Beaumont : I; II, 1; III; IV, 2; V, 3. Fletcher : II, 2; IV, 1; V, 1-2. Like A King and no King , The Maid's Tragedy is essentially Beaumont's work. Fletcher's contribution seems to be confined to four scenes, though one of these IV, 1)—the scene in which Melantius confronts his sister Evadne with his knowledge that she is the mistress of the King, and orders her to murder her royal lover—constitutes the climax of the play. The catastrophe that directly results from this scene, the actual murder of the King by Evadne (V, 1), is also Fletcher's work. As usual with the Beaumont-Fletcher collaborations, the linguistic evidence which the play affords tells us very little. There is no scope for the test of ye : the form occurs but 7 times in the entire play, 5 times in Beaumont's share and twice in scenes by Fletcher. Hath is found 17 times in the Beaumont portion and but thrice in Fletcher's; doth appears 4 times in Beaumont's share and not at all in Fletcher's. This is the only possible evidence of distinct linguistic preferences that emerges for the two collaborators. Here again the contraction 'em is found in the shares of both dramatists: 9 times in Beaumont's, 5 times in Fletcher's. There are single occurrences of i'th' , o'th' , and 's for his in Beaumont's share of the play, though none of these typically Fletcherian contractions appears in the four scenes attributed to him. Of the play's 14 instances of the contraction ha' , 11 are found in scenes of Beaumont's authorship. The Noble Gentleman Beaumont : I, 4; II, 2; III, 1, 3-4; IV, 3-5. Beaumont and Fletcher : I, 1-3; II, 1; III, 2; IV, 1-2; V. I consider the extant text of the play to represent Fletcher's revision of an early work of Beaumont's sole authorship. There is a certain amount of external evidence for such a supposition. The prologue printed with the first folio text declares the play to have been revived some two decades after its original production: we know That what was worne some twenty yeare agoe, Comes into grace againe, and we pursue That custome, by presenting to your view A play in fashion then. According to the Office-Book of Sir Henry Herbert, under the date of 3 February 1626, The Noble Gentleman was licensed for acting as the work of Fletcher ( Herbert , p. 31). The play is certainly not his unaided work, and the supposition must be that, since it had been revised and was about to be re-staged after a considerable lapse of time, it had necessarily to be licensed anew. That it was attributed to Fletcher is understandable, since he was the reviser. An identical situation was to occur eight years later, when Fletcher's A Very Woman was revised by Massigner and re-licensed as his work. 4 If the prologue, with its reference to a play in fashion "some twenty yeare agoe," was spoken at the revival of 1626, then the original date of The Noble Gentleman would be around 1605-6, thus according perfectly with the period of Beaumont's early work. Apart from the occurrence of ye , the linguistic pattern that emerges from the play as a whole closely resembles that of The Woman Hater , another of Beaumont's early and—in its original form—unaided plays which was printed in 1607. Certainly the pattern is, in almost every respect, a decidedly un-Fletcherian one. The total occurrence of hath and doth throughout the play (39 and 23 times respectively) comes close to approximating Beaumont's record use of these forms in The Woman Hater . And the preference for them to the contracted 'em apparent in that play is paralleled here; for 30 instances of them in The Noble Gentleman , there are but 7 of 'em. Ye occurs a total of 38 times in the play, and it is found at least once in all but three of the play's sixteen scenes. The manner in which the Fletcherian ye thus comes to be grafted on to a basic linguistic pattern that fairly abounds with hath's , doth's , and them's makes for something of an anomaly in the plays of the canon. In attributing the respective shares of the two dramatists, I have specified as the work of Beaumont and Fletcher those scenes in which the Fletcherian revisions seem to have been most extensive. Since ye is not unknown in the work of Beaumont, one cannot consider every occurrence of the form in The Noble Gentleman to have been introduced by Fletcher. But it will be understood that, in designating certain scenes as Beaumont's own, I by no means exclude the possibility that Fletcher has made certain stylistic revisions in these as well. It is only that here Beaumont's original work seems less altered than in those scenes where revision has been specifically indicated. Philaster Beaumont : I, 2; II, 1, 3, 4a (to Pharamond's entrance); III; IV, 3-6; V, 1-2, 3a (to King's exit), 5. Fletcher : I, 1; II, 2, 4b (from Pharamond's entrance to end); IV, 1-2; V, 3b (from King's exit to end), 4. Fletcher's share in Philaster is more considerable than in either The Maid's Tragedy or A King and no King , but here again it is overshadowed by Beaumont's, and once again Beaumont's is the controlling hand. Like the other two plays, Philaster exhibits 7 occurrences of ye , 5 of which occur in Fletcher's scenes, 2 in Beaumont's. And as is elsewhere the case in certain of the Beaumont-Fletcher collaborations, the only trace of Fletcher's linguistic pattern that is evident is his general avoidance of third person singular verb forms in -th. Where hath is found 10 times in Beaumont's portion of the play, it appears but thrice in Fletcher's. And while doth does not appear at all in Fletcher's share, it occurs 6 times in Beaumont's. Them is found more frequently than the contracted form in the Beaumont portion, but here again the contraction (which, with one exception, is spelled 'um throughout the play, as in A King and no King ) is used at an almost equal rate in the shares of both dramatists (14 times in Beaumont's, 13 times in Fletcher's) and so can afford no evidence for a distinctive linguistic preference. This is the case with the other contractions that have tended to distinguish Fletcher from Massigner; their rate of occurrence in Philaster , as elsewhere in the Beaumont and Fletcher collaborations, is virtually identical in the shares of both dramatists. The Scornful Lady Beaumont : I, 1; II, 1; V, 2. Fletcher : I, 2; II, 2-3; III; IV; V, 1, 3-4. Perhaps because Fletcher's share of the play is the larger, the features of his linguistic pattern emerge somewhat more clearly than is generally the case in his collaborations with Beaumont. Ye appears a total of 31 times in the play: 29 times in scenes by Fletcher, twice in scenes by Beaumont. The Fletcherian portion displays as well 14 instances of y' , a form which does not appear in Beaumont's share. Fletcher's use of them (4 times) is once again greatly overshadowed by his use of the contracted form, which occurs 4 times as 'em , 20 times as 'um . Other contractions associated with Fletcher are present in abundance: i'th' (20 times), o'th' (6 times), h'as (7 times), 's for his (3 times). But certain at least of these same linguistic forms are to be found in the three scenes assigned to Beaumont: a single instance of 'em and 6 of 'um (to 3 instances of them ), 3 occurrences of i'th' , one of o'th' . Beaumont's share displays 6 occurrences of hath and 2 of doth . In Fletcher's share, doth —as is so often the case—does not appear, but hath is used to the un-Fletcherian total of 9 times. Though Beaumont's share in the actual authorship of the play is decidedly subordinate to Fletcher's, I think there is no doubt that he is responsible for the final form of the extant text. Only thus can I account for the apparently reduced occurrence of ye . If Fletcher is indeed responsible for as much of the play as I credit to him, the supposition would be that originally ye occurred at a much higher rate. The very fact that the form appears to the extent that it does is, I think, to be interpreted as evidence that Fletcher was here the principal collaborator. The Maid's Tragedy and A King and no King afford examples of how, when Fletcher's share was confined to a few scenes, such ye 's as he could manage to introduce in such a comparatively small portion of the whole all but disappeared under Beaumont's revising hand. Thierry and Theodoret Beaumont : III; V, 1. Fletcher : I, 1; II, 2-3; IV, 1; V, 2. Massigner : I, 2; II, 1, 4; IV, 2. Linguistically, the play can be divided into three distinct parts. That of Fletcher's authorship exhibits 21 of the play's 22 occurrences of ye . Those scenes in which ye is found reveal as well a strong preference for the contracted 'em to the full pronoun them . In the Fletcherian portion, them is used but once, while the contraction occurs 21 times; 3 times as 'em , 18 times as 'um . The play's single instance of o'th' is found in Fletcher's V, 2. Such other contractions as i'th' , h'as , and 's for his do not appear in the first quarto text. Hath , in Fletcher's share of the play, occurs 3 times, doth once. Ye does not occur in any of these scenes assigned to Massinger. There are here but 2 occurrences of 'em , to 18 uses of them , so reversing, in Massinger's usual fashion at this period of his career (prior to 1621), the Fletcherian preference. 5 Though doth does not occur in Massinger's share of the play, hath appears 10 times. The play's 2 instances of t' are found in Massinger's II, 1 and IV, 2. 6 The linguistic evidence to be derived from Beaumont's share of the play demonstrates in little a tendency that can be observed in virtually all of his work: a tendency to employ together such distinctive linguistic forms as ye , hath , doth , and 'em , without using any of these to any very marked degree. In his share of Thierry and Theodoret there are single instances of ye , hath , and doth , while 'em and them are used 6 times each. The manner in which the play's 18 occurrences of the pronominal contraction 'um are all to be found in scenes by Fletcher is worthy of notice. The use of the form in Fletcher's unaided work has already been discussed; 7 it appears throughout the first quarto text of Rule a Wife , and the manuscript—prepared from Fletcher's foul papers—of Bonduca . Further evidence for associating the form with Fletcher is afforded by three of the plays—including The Scornful Lady —considered in this section of the present study. The three instances of 'um in Cupid's Revenge are found in scenes assigned to Fletcher. And the three occurrences of the form in The Woman Hater appear in scenes which, if not of Fletcher's original authorship, were certainly re-worked by him. Finally, the fact that in Thierry and Theodoret both Beaumont and Massigner employ the more usual contraction 'em , while all occurrences of 'um are confined to Fletcher's share of the play, is certainly striking. And yet to regard the form as distinctly Fletcherian is to involve oneself in certain real difficulties, as the evidence of three other plays considered in the present section makes clear. In both A King and no King and Philaster , 'um is to be found in abundance throughout the shares of Beaumont and Fletcher alike. And while in The Scornful Lady , 'um appears 20 times in the Fletcherian portion, it appears 6 times in scenes assigned to Beaumont. Since Philaster and A King and no King are largely Beaumont's work, and since presumably all three plays were given their final form by him, it is hard to see how 'um could have found its way into scenes of his authorship if, as the evidence of Thierry and Theodoret implies, 'um was the contraction favored by Fletcher, while 'em represented the preference of Beaumont. The evidence of the first quarto text of Thierry seems valid enough, and there is no reason to attribute the variant forms to the separate practices of two compositors, or to the caprice of a single one. The occurrence of 'em and 'um does not coincide with bibliographical units of the printed text, but with separate scenes of the play itself. Thus while Beaumont's V, 1 contains 5 'em 's and no 'um 's, Fletcher's V, 2 exhibits 4 'um 's and no 'em 's. When, in Fletcher's I, 1, the two forms are found together in the same scene, both 'em 's appear on signatures (B1 v and B2 v ) which contain respectively two and three 'um 's. From this it might be argued, especially since the occurrence is near the beginning of the play, that the compositor was faithfully trying to reproduce the less familiar contraction that stood in his copy, but twice failed to do so and inserted the more usual 'em instead. That 'um was the less familiar of the two contractions, and one not always preserved by compositors, is evident from the fact that, with one exception, all occurrences of the form in the plays of the Beaumont and Fletcher corpus appear only in quarto texts. 'Um appears in the text of only one play ( Wit at Several Weapons ) included in the first folio. In the second folio texts of plays printed from quartos in which 'um appears, the contraction is regularly changed to 'em . A notable example of this is the second folio text of Rule a Wife , printed from the 1640 quarto (the only quarto edition of the play). The 27 instances of 'um in the quarto appear in the second folio as 'em . To conclude, on the evidence of the manuscript of Bonduca , and the quarto texts of Thierry and Theodoret and Rule a Wife (and, to a lesser extent, the quarto texts of Cupid's Revenge and The Woman Hater ), there is reasonably good evidence for regarding the pronominal contraction 'um as a distinct feature of Fletcher's linguistic usage, but until an explanation is furnished for the occurrence of the form in the Beaumont portion of Philaster , A King and no King , and The Scornful Lady , one is hardly justified in doing so. The Woman Hater Beaumont : I; II; III, 2-4; IV, 1; V, 1, 3-4. Beaumont and Fletcher : III, 1; IV, 2-3; V, 2, 5. Published in quarto in 1607, the play was the first in the Beaumont and Fletcher corpus to appear in print. It is essentially Beaumont's, and in all probability represents an early work of his unaided authorship. Beyond any doubt, however, at least five scenes had been revised by Fletcher by the time the play was printed, for these are noticeably stamped with pronominal ye 's, a fact which at once renders them conspicuous amid the rest of the play, and affords evidence of Fletcher's fondness for the form even at this early date. In the five scenes where Fletcher's hand is present, ye occurs a total of 76 times; elsewhere in the play it occurs but twice. The linguistic pattern that emerges from the play as a whole—excluding these five scenes —is decidedly non-Fletcherian. In it, hath is used 75 times, doth 21 times. There is evident here a strong preference for the full pronoun them over the contracted form which occurs once as 'em , thrice as 'am , the last a form which has occurred twice in The Knight of the Burning Pestle . There are single instances of i'th' , o'th' , and 's for his . The pattern—putting aside the very high occurrence of hath and doth —is typical of Beaumont, with his eclectic taste in contractions, but his tendency to use none to a marked degree. Apart from ye , it would be difficult to determine whether or not such other linguistic forms as are exhibited in the scenes revised by Fletcher are to be traced to him. The 11 instances of hath found here seem rather excessive for Fletcher, though the same five scenes display but a single use of doth . And in view of what has already been said regarding the contraction 'um , it may be significant that the 3 instances of the form in the play appear in scenes where the Fletcherian ye is conspicuously present.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes * For Parts I and II of this series, see Studies in Bibliography , vols. VIII and IX. 1 Bibliographical Studies in the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647 , pp. 61 ff. 2 The 4 occurrences of ye in the first act of the manuscript text are troublesome. The scene is unmistakably Massinger's, and there is no reason to suppose the ye 's to have entered it through revision by either Beaumont or Fletcher. Since the ye 's do not occur in the corresponding passages of the folio, and in view of Massinger's known tendency to avoid the form, it is tempting to consider the scribe responsible for their introduction into the manuscript. But if this is so, one is faced with the possibility that the scribe is responsible as well for the 11 ye 's (beyond the folio's one) that the manuscript exhibits in the Beaumont scenes of Act V, or the 13 ye 's that Act IV of the manuscript demonstrates beyond the folio's 60. The obvious fact that emerges is simply that, on the evidence available, it is not possible to state whether the scribe has introduced into his manuscript ye 's that were not in his copy, or whether the folio compositor has ignored ye 's that did stand in his. 3 Cf., for instance, the entry for 16 August 1634: "An ould play, with some new scenes, Doctor Lambe and the Witches, to Salisbury Court, . . .,—one pound" ( Herbert , p. 36); or that for 12 May 1636: "Received of ould Cartwright for allowing the [Fortune] company to add scenes to an ould play, and to give it out for a new one, . . .,—one pound" ( Herbert , p. 37). 4 Cf.

      <field name="heading_text">The Distribution of Almanacks in the Second Half of the Seventeenth Century by Cyprian Blagden</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NATURE HAS ARRANGED THAT, WHERE THE odds against survival are heavy, the seeds or the eggs through which survival is achieved are proliferated; in the world of the printed word, human activity achieves a corresponding balance by destroying a very high proportion of the books which are produced in the greatest quantities. This must surely be a cause for rejoicing in the twentieth century—so far at least as contemporary production is concerned; but it can be a cause of difficulty, and even of error, when we move back 250 years or more and are forced to rely, for instance, on a single mutilated copy of a school book or even on hearsay for our knowledge of a once widely distributed and frequently handled publication. The study of Literature is probably unaffected by this; but our understanding of what people were reading is made more difficult. Moreover, with the destruction of popular literature went (though for somewhat different reasons) the almost total destruction of the records of its manufacture and distribution; and the survival of quantitative evidence dating back into the seventeenth century is rare enough to be exciting. It happened that, in 1603, the Stationers' Company received from James I the sole right of printing—amongst other popular books—Almanacks and Prognostications; and there has survived one of the ledgers 1 —a Stock Book dating from sixty years later—in which were maintained the basic records of the trading company within the Company. For the first twenty-four years of the Stock Book's use a detailed account was kept of the almanacks delivered to the Treasurer, the 'manager' of the English Stock of the Stationers' Company; from these details, and from such other contemporary evidence as I have been able to find, I want to show the size and importance of one kind of popular book production during the reigns of Charles II and James II. A certain amount of information about the Company's policy in the production and sale of almanacks from 1603 can be found in the Court Books, 2 and there are useful items of information in the Treasurer's Journal which covers the years from 1653 to 1698. Mr Bosanquet has written, in general terms and out of his great experience of handling surviving examples, an account 3 of almanacks during the seventeenth century. I will therefore concentrate upon the quantitative detail which survives in the Stock Book and try to answer as many as possible of the following questions: How many copies of each almanack were printed in London and how many almanacks sold well enough to be reprinted? What proportions remained unsold? Which were printed at Cambridge and in what quantities? What evidence is there for other printing of almanacks—either in London or elsewhere, either surreptitious or legitimate? What were the costs of setting and printing the texts and of printing the plates, and what was the price of paper? How much were the authors paid? At what prices did the Treasurer sell to London booksellers and what prices did country booksellers and the public normally pay? Finally, what profit did the almanack monopoly earn for the partners in the English Stock? The answers to some of these questions are simple and can be given most easily in tabular form. But, since it would be fatiguing to supply all the figures in all the years for which they are available, I have, in Table I, shown the details of first printings, reprints and unsold copies for nine years only—for the first three years, for the next three (which are also the first three after the Fire) and for the last three. The year at the head of each column is, of course, that for which and not in which the almanacks were printed. In order to provide a complete picture for one almanack and an indication of the steadiness of the almanack business (the evidence being available for a much longer period), I have, in Table II given the numbers printed of Andrews for all but two of the twenty-four years; and in Table III the value, at wholesale prices, of all the almanacks delivered to the Treasurer from the winter of 1663/4 to the winter of 1713/4, the last of the Stuart era. Table IV lists those almanacks which appeared after 1669 and disappeared before 1685, and which therefore do not find places in Table I. Table II.

(I have also done this in Table IV.) It will be noticed that most of the almanacks fall into one or other of two main categories: 'blanks' and 'sorts'; the former were half a sheet (eight pages) longer than the latter and had the first two sheets rubricated, as compared with the first only; they also gave a whole opening, rather than a single page, to each month. The resulting blank spaces were used for private entries and provided the name for this category; 8 it is possible that variety in 'sorts' developed while there was still only one 'blank', but it can be seen in Table IV that new almanacks tried out during the reign of Charles II were almost all 'blanks'. In Table I, I have also given a column for the amounts (taken from the Journal) paid annually to authors, at the beginning and at the end of the period: a few copies of each almanack were also bound up for presentation to authors, who usually received, in addition, a number of stitched 'offprints'. The normal rate for authors of 'sorts' was £2 throughout the century; as early as 1631 Braithwaite 9 was grumbling at the payment, but sixty years later Mr (?William) Leybourn was content to compile half a dozen or more at forty shillings a piece. For others, however, the rate varied—perhaps with the success of the product the previous year; the 1658 arrangement with William Lilly, for instance, was that he should receive £60 if the sales of his almanack reached 20,000. John Tipper, writing to Humphrey Wanley in November 1703, 10 told him that the Company never paid the author for the first year of a new almanack (though he had been given 100 copies as a present) but that 'if it comes to be printed another year, then they will give me proportionate to what they give others'. The first of the questions to which answers cannot be given in the Tables concerns surreptitious printing, and only the vaguest answer is possible. In the Journal there are scores of references to the buying in of counterfeit almanacks, to the payment of informers and to legal action against pirates. It is obvious that, when 20,000 copies of a book are being distributed within a few weeks, it cannot have been difficult for a pirate, with the connivance of a wholesaler, to feed another 5,000 to the market; since, as I shall show, there was also good profit to be earned by almanack publishing, both opportunity for and temptation to piracy existed; but the extent cannot even be guessed at. The most flagrant case I have found was the printing of almanacks at York in the early part of the period; this was the chief subject discussed, as a result of journeys to the north, at the last meeting of the Court before the Fire; it was the only subject minuted after the first—but informal—post-Fire meeting. In the end the two York stationers, Francis Mawburn (who admitted to distributing 4,000 almanacks, with twenty different titles, 11 and some sheet almanacks) and Richard Lambert paid the English Stock respectively £65 and £24, early in 1667. The heaviness of the fines reflects either the enormous quantities unlawfully produced or the Company's determination to give a sharp lesson to stationers in the city which had recently received official permission to have a press, or both. In addition to the surreptitious printing of the Company's copies, there was the legitimate production of other almanacks—in Dublin; in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow; in Oxford and Cambridge; and even in London, where Raven's and a Welsh almanack were printed under licence. Moreover, the Seymour family laid claim to certain almanacks, 12 as part (I suppose) of the School Book Patent; and there was a trickle of near-almanack publishing, 13 which hoped to cash in on the demand without quite infringing the Company's monopoly. Unfortunately, the vouchers from which the Journal was posted have been destroyed and there are seldom sufficient details, against the payments to printers, to tell what work was being paid for. The most one is told—and this very seldom—is that, in 1668 for instance, Milbourn was paid at the rate of 3 s. 4 d. each for twenty reams of Booker and forty-five of Trigge, and that Bruges was paid £9 13 s. 4 d. for twenty-nine reams of Saunders; or that in 1673 Lilliecrap received £7 10 s. for twenty reams of Dade and, two years later, Bruges £12 for thirty-two reams of Andrews. 14 These are all post-Fire prices and the rates per ream, which work out at 3 s. 4 d. , 6 s. 8 d. and 7 s. 6 d. , are obviously inadequate figures upon which to base any general estimate of cost. Luckily Dr Thomas Yate, Principal of Brazenose College, Oxford, and Bishop Fell's efficient lieutenant, 15 has left some estimates he made about 1671 for printing at Oxford a three-sheet book almanack in octavo. He took paper at 4 s. a ream (allowing 10% for wastage), composing and printing at 2 s. 6 d. a ream and rolling-press work at 4 d. per 1,000. If we accept Yate's figure for paper (which is occasionally confirmed in the Journal), drop the charge for the rolling-press (since the crude illustrations in the London almanacks must have been printed with the text) and bear in mind the facts that the Company rubricated two of the three sheets and often employed more than one printer for the same almanack, the Journal figures make more, if not complete, sense, and we can compile the following tentative estimate for 10,000 copies of a 'blank' 16 almanack at post-Fire rates: £ s. d. 66 reams of paper &amp;c.mmat; 4 s. 13 4 0 composing and printing &amp;c.mmat; 3 s. 4 d. for 2 rubricated sheets 7 6 8 &amp;c.mmat; 2 s. 6 d. for remaining sheet 2 15 0 copy money, say 7 10 0 -------- total 30 15 8 wholesale price &amp;c.mmat; £8 per 1,000 80 0 0 I have worked out that, over the ten-year period 1673/4—1682/3, the total expenditure by the English Stock on paper, printing and authorship was 38.2% of the total value, at wholesale rates, of all books and almanacks delivered to the Treasurer; 38.2% of £80 is £30 11 s. 2½ d. My figure for the printing of 10,000 'blanks' could be varied considerably by altering the sum paid to the author or the ratio of that sum to the number printed; and it is only put forward tentatively. 17 I am inclined to think that I have underestimated the rates for printing, which would mean that the profit on books, which took months to accumulate, was (quite understandably) greater than that on almanacks which was earned in a few weeks—assuming that the length of credit on each kind of business was the same. The possibility that I have overestimated the profit on almanacks is, to some extent, supported by Richard Head who, in The English Rogue , 18 estimates that the Company cleared, in the early 1660s, over £1,000 a year from the sale of almanacks. 'But a knavish printer,' he goes on, 'lately outwitted them, for he printed a great number of almanacks, and though he printed but two sorts, yet they served for all the other sorts [an ingenious method of dealing with the 'sorts', and not so far from the Company's], only altering the title page, at the beginning, and the last sheet which we call the prog, or prognostication. These almanacks he affording cheaper than ordinary, as indeed well he might [a telling phrase], he sold off a good number of them, which was to his gain and their great hindrance, but he is lately discovered, and how they will deal with him I know not.' For once we know more than Richard Head; but his account of the York piracy suggests that the profit of the English Stock (out of which, of course, came handsome dividends to the partners) was greater than private booksellers normally made and that there was some foundation for the usual complaint that monopolies led to high prices. If, however, my calculations are right, the annual profit on almanacks was much nearer £1,500 than £1,000, and we know that it remained, until well into the second half of the nineteenth century, what Christopher Barker had called it in 1582 (when it was still going into the pockets of Watkins and Roberts) 'a pretty commoditie toward an honest mans lyving'. The last questions to which I would like to find complete answers concern the rates at which country booksellers normally bought from the London wholesalers and the prices which members of the public paid. The evidence for transactions of this kind is extremely difficult to find, but some light is thrown on trade prices by a dispute between a Chester bookseller, Richard Thropp, and his London correspondent, Edward Dod; this led to a lawsuit in 1653. 19 From the evidence (and assuming that the English Stock rates were the same ten years before as they were in 1663) the following comparative figures can be given: 'sorts' 'blanks' Gallen Lilly s. s. s. s. rate per 100 to wholesalers 10 12 14 37 rate per 100 to retailers 10/8 d. 13 17 46 It also appears that some almanacks were supplied in small quantities, bound in sheep and clasped: Gallen &amp;c.mmat; six for 2 s. 9 d. , Booker (a 'blank') &amp;c.mmat; four for 2 s. 2 d. and Goldsmith (8 s. per 100 to wholesalers) at six for 1 s. 10 d. The binding rates for Gallen and Booker work out, respectively, at 3½ d. and 5 d. a copy; unfortunately, the list of binding prices, agreed in 1669, makes no mention either of almanacks or of clasping. Competition for the country market must have been severe in the standard lines—'blanks' and 'sorts'—for the wholesaler to have been satisfied with such a small margin. The binding costs were high for single almanacks; but it is believed that many private customers used to have a dozen or more bound up together. The proportion of almanacks which survive in these bound sets is naturally large and may give a false picture of the numbers treated in this way; but many people must have bought them primarily as reference books or as 'desk' books, and only Rider, Gallen and Goldsmith were designed for carrying about, flat or rolled—the ancestors of our pocket diaries. The alternatives in the method and cost of binding, as always in the seventeenth century, make it almost impossible to arrive at what we know as the published prices. Before the Fire, Anthony Wood normally bought 'sorts' at 3 d. and 'blanks' at 4 d. each and for Wharton (1658) he paid 6 d. ; these were probably interleaved and stitched; in December 1667 he paid 7½ d. for Gadbury. Another Oxford customer, Dr Stringer, bought an almanack in 1651 for 2 d. from Henry Cripps, 20 who, a year later, sold another almanack for 6 d. ! The post-Fire prices would be at least 25% higher; but this does not get us very far. If any reader of this article can direct me to booksellers' advertisements or private accounts which will throw any light on the mark-up, with or without the addition of binding, between wholesale and retail prices during the seventeenth century, I shall be grateful. 'Of necessity,' writes Mr Bosanquet at the beginning of the article to which I have already referred, 'an old Almanack, merely as an Almanack, must be a very dull book;' and he gives some splendid reasons in support of this statement. But he devotes the rest of the article to showing what interest and information lie hidden in almanacks. Moreover, he speculates about the numbers of copies printed. 'If the average edition,' he says, 'only consisted of from 1,500 to 2,000 copies, we have a total of from three to four millions for the century, and this must be well under the mark. Figures such as these, even though they do not pretend to be correct, show that no book in the English language had such a large circulation as the annual Almanack.' This is as true as it is important, both for the effect of these little books on a population which was quite small and still far from literate, and for the sheer volume of business with which the book trade was able to deal in the few weeks before Christmas. But the really remarkable point is that Mr Bosanquet's estimate of quantity is true not for the whole century but for the ten years from November 1663. We cannot however multiply his estimate by ten and arrive thereby at a new figure for the century; although the almanack business was a profitable one when the Company took it over, it is most unlikely that the numbers printed approached those of 1664 until the effects both of the Civil War stimulus to printing and of the Restoration conditions for peaceful distribution could be felt together. 1665 was, in fact, a minor peak of a year, which was not equalled until 1683; it would be unwise to continue the line of the graph, which is astonishingly level during the period for which we have figures, backwards into the first half of the century, at anything like the same height; but further guessing would be valueless. In conclusion, I should like to mention again a factor which affected both the total number of almanacks in circulation and the decisions which the Stock-keepers made about the numbers to print for their stock each year; this factor is the quantity of almanacks surreptitiously printed. The figures in the 'unsold' columns for 1665 and 1666 in Table I, compared with those for the previous year, show clearly how well the size of the market was normally estimated 21 and how vulnerable the Company was to competition; Mawburn and Lambert were not discovering a wholly new public from York but, to an uncomfortable extent, biting into the existing market. The value of unsold almanacks tended to increase as the century grew older; in 1684 it was nearly £250 and by 1696 it was over £300. It therefore seems as if the evenness of the Company's production in a generally expanding market might be explained by the ever-present fear—and fact—of infringement. The attack might come at any point: in 1666 and 1667 it seems to have been aimed at Pond and Dove; and by the time the culprits have been discovered the damage has been done; piracy may only delay the sale of a book; it destroys the sale of an annual. In spite of its caution, the English Stock found itself landed each year with a few more reams of unsold 22 almanacks; but, aided by its caution, the Company clung to most of the profits to be made in this market under the changing conditions of the eighteenth century, and it was not until 1775 that Thomas Carnan succeeded in breaking the almanack monopoly.

'Blanks' contained 3 and 'Sorts' 2½ sheets. The London 'Sheet' Almanacks were compiled by Gadbury and Wing. The absence of a figure in the "Copy" column means not that no money was paid to the author but that I have been able to discover no evidence of payment. For 1685-7 there are no details of unsold almanacks and, in the valuations for these years, books and almanacks are lumped together. All 30 almanacks for 1687 were advertised in the Term Catalogue for Michaelmas 1686.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I am grateful to the Master and Wardens of the Stationers' Company for permission to use and quote from the Company's records. 2 Court Book C, up to 1640, has been edited by Professor Jackson, and published earlier this year by the Bibliographical Society. 3 The Library , 4th ser., X (1930). 4 The policy of not detailing the almanacks delivered, which was adopted permanently from November 1687, was in operation for the years 1681 and 1682. 5 Owing to the increase of prices as a result of the Fire, this figure represents a sharp drop in numbers printed, compared with the previous year. What is remarkable is that the drop was not much greater. 6 The impact of the new Paper Duties begins to be felt this year. 7 See note 4 above. 8 Almanacks were often interleaved before binding, as were Dr More's copies of Rider and Goldsmith which are in the University Library at Cambridge; and some, like Anthony Wood's copies of 'blanks' and 'sorts' (in the Bodleian), were bound with blank leaves at either end. 9 Eustace F.

From 1670 Lilliecrap's name appears on the title-pages of Dade; Milbourn's name is intermittently associated with almanacks, but never with either Booker or Trigge; I have found no mention of Bruges. 15 For an account of him see Print and Privilege at Oxford , by J. Johnson and S. Gibson (1946); and for his estimates see Oxford University Archives, S.E.P. 11 * , 7. 16 The calculation for 10,000 'sorts', in which only the first sheet was rubricated, would be: £ s. d. 55 reams of paper &amp;c.mmat; 4 s. 11 0 0 composing &amp; printing &amp;c.mmat; 3 s. 4 d. for 1 sheet 3 13 4 &amp;c.mmat; 2 s. 6 d. for 1½ sheets 4 2 6 copy money 2 0 0 ------ total 20 15 10 Similar calculations could be made for Lilly and Wharton, and, with modifications, for those in 120 and 240. 17 Some confirmation of my estimate is provided by a statement (in the Waste Court Book for 7 Jan. 1668) that Robert White had printed 6,650 copies of the Protestant Almanack for Mr Ponder at a cost of £19 17 s. 6 d. This works out at almost exactly £30 for 10,000. No charge for authorship would be included in this figure; but to offset this there was about one third more paper and printing, since the Protestant Almanack , 1668, was, as Mr Neil Ker has kindly verified for me from the Magdalen College copy, of four sheets and not of three. 18 1928 reprint, p. 384. 19 See the article by Mr Stewart-Brown in The Library , 4th ser., IX (1929). 20 Bodley, MS Jesus Coll.

The drop in the 1669 total was due to the Treasurer's habit (only discovered ten years later) of selling on his own account almanacks printed at Cambridge! This habit accounts for the lack of reference to Whiting; Ephemeris (Wing A 2762). The odd quantities of many of the Cambridge figures are caused by the keeping back of some almanacks for sale at and near Cambridge.

      <field name="heading_text">The Dramatic Piracies of 1661: A Comparative Analysis by Johan Gerritsen *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AS STUDENTS OF THE SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLISH drama are only too well aware, the year 1661 saw a sudden spring for one of the more lucrative ventures in commercial publishing, the pirating of popular plays. With the theatres once again open, and the stocks of play-books understandably low, here was a heaven-sent opportunity for the less scrupulous publisher, and there is evidence that he took it. A name that looms large in all accounts of the matter is that of Francis Kirkman. For a general account the reader may be referred to Professor R. C. Bald's article in Modern Philology , XLI (1943), 17-32, and to Mr Strickland Gibson's Bibliography of Francis Kirkman , Oxford, 1949 (Oxford Bibliographical Society), unless he wishes to immerse himself in Kirkman's own, and not unamusing, The Unlucky Citizen , 1673. Kirkman, in fact, denied all responsibility, though not quite all complicity, stating that he had been drawn in by others and that he, for his part, only printed three play-books, which were his own proper copies. Whatever truth there be in this — and we may note that Mr Gibson accepts it more or less implicitly —, the owners of the copyrights were not impressed, took the simplest way out, and had Kirkman's stock seized. And Kirkman, as he tells us himself, never got any redress. At this day, it is doubtful whether we shall ever know the ins and outs of the matter, but what can be said with certainty is that Kirkman, whether or not he was the principal culprit (and unlike any of the other candidates with the exception of his printer, Thomas Johnson) can be connected with most of these piracies. That this is so was borne in upon the present writer in a rather unusual way. On 17 September 1955, while examining the Folger Shakespeare Library's holdings in Beaumont and Fletcher, he came upon an excerpt from the 1647 folio, signatures 2K2-2M4 v , consisting of exactly one play, Beggars Bush . And the point of the examination at that stage being watermarks, it was not less than startling to note that the marks in the excerpt did not belong in the folio. A cursory examination of the text, however, was enough to show that this was not an excerpt from the folio at all, but an independent print, made to resemble the folio as much as possible. Signatures and lay-out were the same, there was even the same row of fleurons at the head of the text, but the ornamental initial I was different, the tailpiece was different, and the spelling was rather more modern, beginning with the head-title itself, which reads BUSH, not BVSH. Now there would be an obvious explanation handy in the recollection that both for the 1616 Jonson first folio and the 1685 Shakespeare fourth folio, under-printed sheets had been reprinted at a later date to make up complete sets when the stock of these sheets fell short. But this explanation seemed just a little too pat. For though the cases just mentioned are well-established, and though for the Jonson the resetting was much more extensive than has been realized, it seemed rather fortuitous that resetting should have been necessary not merely for six consecutive sheets, but for six consecutive sheets containing exactly one play. These considerations seemed sufficient to reject the supplementary reprint theory as a working hypothesis, and to cast about for a better one. And in this connexion one fact was thought not without possible significance. Beggars Bush was printed in the 1647 folio, which means that Moseley, like ourselves, did not know of any earlier edition. The first known print outside the folio, in fact, was the quarto published by Humphrey Robinson and Anne Moseley, the owners of the copyright, in 1661. Now in some copies of this quarto there is a note on the title-page which did not look without its possibilities in the context: You may speedily expect those other Playes, which Kirkman , and his Hawkers have deceived the buyers withall, selling them at treble the value, that this and the rest will be sold for, which are the onely Originall and corrected copies, as they were first purchased by us at no mean rate, and since printed by us. What no-one had explained so far was why, of all plays, Beggars Bush should have been selected for reprinting and for carrying this note, unless that play itself had been pirated. And the accusing finger pointed at Kirkman seemed well worth the trouble of examining all the books printed for him and connected with him in the years 1660-1662 that could be found. The total came to just over twenty, and among these, two were of particular significance: John Dauncey's A Compendious Chronicle of the Kingdom of Portugal , 1661, and the same author's The English Lovers, or, a Girl worth Gold , 1662. The first of these gives Thomas Johnson for its printer, both are printed for Kirkman and one or two others, and both have at the end an identical catalogue of books printed for and to be sold by Francis Kirkman, 1 followed by an Advertisement which, with a fine insolence, runs as follows: Those books and playes specified in the preceding Catalogue, I acknowledge to be my own Copies, and printed by my direction and order, but whereas in the title page of a Play called Beggers Bush , I am charged with printing and publishing that play and others, and to have exhausted the Prices of them, I desire notice may be taken that I printed none of them, but whosoever did, though he have printed them in a fairer Character and better Paper, yet can and will afford them as cheap as any whose Covetousness makes them print them in a Character, and Paper not fit for any Gentleman to look on. Though that is not its main significance in our context, it may be noted that the phrasing of the advertisement leaves an interesting loophole, for all that Kirkman really says, after having first been so explicit about 'my direction and order' and 'printing and publishing', is that he never printed any of them. Since he never was a printer, that, doubtless, is entirely true. What is, however, of special importance for our investigation is Kirkman's amplification of the Beggars Bush accusation. Though the use of the words 'those other Playes' clearly implied that the play itself had been pirated, Robinson and Mrs Moseley did not actually say so. But Kirkman, the dramatic specialist, who in at least five of his publications offered to furnish anyone with 'all the Playes that were ever yet printed', and who published a list of nearly 700 after Tom Tyler and his Wife , not only acknowledges the charge expressis verbis , but also does not deny the piracy's existence. And for a very good reason, for he is offering it for sale in the front of the very book, the Chronicle , in which the Advertisement first appears. There, in a list of works of which he has 'sufficient numbers', and heading the section Playes , we find: The Beggars Bush , a Comedy written by Fran. Beamont and John Fletcher , both in folio, and in quarto. And the list goes on: The Humerous Lieutenant ; a Comedy, in folio. Taken by themselves, these two Beaumont and Fletcher entries might be, and generally have been thought to refer to excerpts from the 1647 folio. But surely, Kirkman would never have had 'sufficient numbers' — and the works are mentioned 'more especially' for this reason — of just two excerpts from the folio. There was thus, not only, a piracy of Beggars Bush , but also one, still to be recovered, of The Humorous Lieutenant . What we know then, so far, is that our Beggars Bush was in existence in 1661, and probably appeared not very long before the quarto, as a member of a larger series of piracies. Now three piratical reprints, The Elder Brother, A King and no King , and The Maids Tragedy , are known with the imprint London, Printed in the Year, 1661, which at least leaves no doubt about their date. But five others have at various times been assigned to this year, though they all have the same imprint as the previous legitimate edition. They are, another Elder Brother , '1637' (STC 11067, Greg 515c); Loves Mistress , '1640' (STC 13354, Greg 504c); Philaster , '1652' (Greg 363g, not in Wing); and two reprints of The Scornful Lady , '1651' (Wing B 1608, Greg 334g; and Greg 334h, not in Wing). To these we may now add Beggars Bush , folio, and our hypothetical The Humorous Lieutenant , folio, making ten in all. And the only man ever to advertise them all, is Francis Kirkman. 2 Links between Beggars Bush and the others are not far to seek, nor are links between the piracies and the other publications of Kirkman and his syndicate around 1661. It is true that Beggars Bush is set apart from the rest by its format — a pirate who wished to be undetected was obliged to reprint in folio — so that we need not look for the use of standing type, but enough distinctive features remain to make identification easy. The main fount, to begin with, is a peculiar one. Basically a normal pica fount, measuring 81 mm for 20 lines, it is notable for the addition of small caps and titling caps cast on the same pica body, used indiscriminately instead of the normal size. 3 Apparently the fount had once fallen short on capitals, but the use of titling caps to make good the deficiency is highly uncommon and makes the fount very easy to spot. Now this fount has long been known to occur in some of the 1661 piracies, but that is not its only appearance. We find it in both the '1637' and the 1661 Elder Brother , in A King and no King , in The Maids Tragedy , and further in Hells Higher Court of Justice (Wing D 27, 1661), The English Lovers , Tom Tyler , the Catalogue , all 1661, and finally in The Wits , printed for Henry Marsh, 1662. We may further note that the titling B on 2K2 v a, l. 11 from below, of Beggars Bush was printed by the identical type which printed that on B3 v , l. 19, of the '1637' Elder Brother , while the King and no King uses for its act headings the same fount as does the Beggars Bush , the identity being proved by the u of Tertius on 2L1 v of the latter, which was put there by the same type that printed the second u of Secundus on B3 v of the former. Moreover, we find another link with Tom Tyler in that the same rather coarse ornamental I opens both plays, an I which also appears in Matthew Griffith, The Fear of God and the King (Wing G 2012), 4 which was printed for (and by?) Thomas Johnson in 1660. Now Tom Tyler , in its turn, shares probably its watermark, and certainly its ornamental block of a vase and flowers, with the '1637' Elder Brother . The latter, again, shares another ornamental block and an ornamental initial N of the same series as the I with the 1661 Elder Brother , and on i A2 it has the identical setting of fleurons which we find at the top of A2 v in The Presbyterian Lash, or, Noctroff's Maid Whipt , printed 'for the use of Mr. Noctroff's friends' in 1661. The Lash has some importance for dating purposes, as it was received by Thomason on 25 March. It is a skit, written to annoy the Rev. Zachary Crofton, and it has a preface signed by K. F. On the same principle which turned Crofton into Noctroff, K. F. is customarily read as F. K., i.e. Francis Kirkman. The Lash , besides assuring us that the '1637' Elder Brother was actually printed in March, 1661, further links up with Hells Higher Court through a defective large capital C on the title-page of both, and another defective italic capital C occurring on the title-page of the former and in one of the headlines of the latter. The '1637' Elder Brother , moreover, shares an initial B of the same series as before with the King and no King . The English Lovers , next to be considered, is a more intricate case. Like the Lash and Hells Higher Court , it presents evidence of more than one text fount, but unlike these, it was not so clearly set up in one shop. No reservations need, however, be made in stating that the first five sheets of this octavo volume were printed in the same shop as the others now under consideration. On B1 we find the same large C already noticed in the Lash and Hells Higher Court ; on B4 we find a large lower case O which recurs in the head-title on B1 of the 1661 Elder Brother , and on the title-page of this play we see that the d of Elder was printed by the same type which printed on D6 v of the Lovers . Similarly, a large titling E on A4 v recurs on the title-page of The Maids Tragedy . And to confirm the correctness of our identification of the text fount, we notice a pica titling S on C8. These nine books, then, Beggars Bush , the '1637' and 1661 Elder Brother , Hells Higher Court , the Lash , A King and no King , The Maids Tragedy , Tom Tyler and its Catalogue, and the first section of the Lovers form a compact group and leave no doubt that they come from one shop. A similarly compact group can be found if we now examine the remaining piracies and the other productions of the Kirkman group. The piracies still to be accounted for are the '1652' Philaster , the '1640' Loves Mistress , and the two reprints of The Scornful Lady , both dated 1651. The relation, if any, of the second Scornful Lady , Greg's no 334g, to the rest is not clear, though it is certain that it was set partly from the other (334h) and partly from the true 1651 edition. But the first Scornful Lady shares with Loves Mistress a damaged titling N of medium size, occurring on the title-page in both volumes, and, as already noted by Professor Bowers, 5 the fleuron band on A1 v of Loves Mistress recurs, with the addition of two parentheses, on A2 of The Scornful Lady . Similarly, we find on A2 of Loves Mistress a certain obliquely decapitated fleuron which recurs on A2 of Philaster , and also on A2 of A pleasant Comedy , called, The Two Merry Milk-maids , printed by Thomas Johnson and sold by Brook, Kirkman, Johnson and Marsh, i.e. the same consortium of Tom Tyler , 1661. And moreover, Loves Mistress now turns out to have similar links with the Milk-maids , of which we may mention the two E's of READER on A2 of the latter, which recur in PHENIX and EDWARD on respectively the title-page and A2 of the former. Some further links in our chain are now easily come by, since they were already worked out by Professor Bowers in his article just cited, and we may add The Thracian Wonder , A Cure for a Cuckold and Gammer Gurtons Nedle without further comment, except for noting that they are all dated 1661 and all mention Thomas Johnson for their printer, with Kirkman and his group, including Johnson, for publishers. The year's productions can now be rounded off with A merry Dialogue between Band, Cuff, and Ruff , printed for F. K., 1661, another little gadfly affair like Hells Higher Court and, to some extent, the Lash , but far from new. It presents an immediate link with Philaster , as they have an identical fleuron setting and enclosing rules — with slight extra leading in Band, Cuff and Ruff — on their title-pages. The only publication which now remains, 6 besides the one Scornful Lady , is Bottom the Weaver (Wing S 2937), which was printed for Kirkman and Marsh in 1661, could well belong to either group, but has nothing that will serve for a definite link. There is, however, one further publication that should be linked to this group, and one which, between its covers, crystallizes the problem of the relation between the two groups: The English Lovers . As already observed, the Lovers' first section unambiguously belongs with our first group. But as stated on an earlier page, it also has at its end a catalogue and advertisement of Kirkman's which appeared in the identical type-setting, except for minor corrections made in the Lovers , at the end of the Chronicle of Portugal . In both books they form an integral part of the work, not a separate final section as do some other advertisement lists, and all necessary conjugacies can be easily established. The Chronicle is a signed Johnson book, and though, as an unadorned octavo, it provides no typographic links with the second group, which is also certainly Johnson's work, it is yet sufficient to link the Lovers also with that group. The Lovers , indeed, is a complicated book. Its collation, 8°: A-E 8 , 2 A-M 8 , is modestly intriguing, but the evidence from headlines and type is very much so, though at least they go together: 1: (A) B-E; 2: 2 A-D, 2 K-M; 3: 2 E-I. Or more explicitly, the book begins with five sheets signed A-E, all in the same pica text fount, and with the same sets of headlines persisting from B through E. There we find the signatures, and pagination, starting all over at A and 1 again, with a different set of headlines and a different pica text fount, while the text begins with Part I, Book II. And though, with four pages of that Book to go, the text is continuous from 2 D to 2 E, after 2 D type and headlines suddenly jump five sheets to pick up at 2 K and quietly finish the book, while in between, sheets 2 E-I, we find a third pica text fount and a third set of headlines. And as if cutting the book into sections of five, four, five, and three sheets respectively were not enough, we moreover discover that K was already printed off by the time I was being set, since the compositor of I, three lines from the end of I1 v , concluded that he had not enough copy left to fill his sheet and decided to make it do so all the same by turning in his pica cases and using english instead. 7 This time he cast off correctly, and the larger type did the job. Our problem, whether our two groups of books are both from the shop of Thomas Johnson, therefore resolves itself into the question whether The English Lovers was entirely set up in it or not. Now the division of copy seems rather peculiar for work in more than one shop, and the signatures will not countenance it at all, unless we are to assume that by the time printing started, only about half the book had yet been written, a hypothesis that has little to commend itself, also in view of the continuous printing from 2 D to 2 K. But if the whole copy was available before the book was allocated to its printer(s), then the division of the copy into four shares does not fit with division among either two or the maximum three shops, because of the sandwiching of one printer's stint between two stints of another. Moreover, if the copy was originally divided between several shops it would have been cast off first, and we should not expect a perfect link from 2 D to 2 E and such an imperfect one from 2 I to 2 K. But what especially argues against division among shops is the signing. If the copy had been cast off before division among shops, the signatures would have been marked in it, and not only would the second printer not have started with A again, but the third printer, whether or not he was identical with the first, would never have begun to sign his stint with E. If, however, the whole book was the work of a single shop, it is not difficult to account for what happened. With an original cast-off only so far forward as to ensure a proper join between the first two sections, the missigning in the second section can be explained as the result of the second compositor's notion that he had the first sheet of text, his colleague at the other press the preliminaries, including the beginning of the text. That this is not far-fetched is demonstrated by this colleague himself, who also missigned the first page of the sheet following the preliminaries A, instead of B. 8 And of course the consequential missigning in 2 E becomes automatic. There are some further links between the two groups, though none of them of a compelling nature. Thus a particular found of handsome titling capitals, easily recognizable because its E's and I's came from faulty matrices and invariably show a more or less clear white hairline about mid-way across the shank, is in evidence in both. The E's mentioned for Loves Mistress and the Milk-maids belong to it, and similar E's are to be found in the 1661 Elder Brother and in the first section of the Lovers , from the other group. And in fact there are some indications that our group differences are indeed differences, not between shops, but between compositors in one shop using distinct typecases in their charge. The evidence for this consists in a headline peculiarity, and if this interpretation is right, it means that the compositor who used the mixed fount first encountered in Beggars Bush was in the habit of setting up his headlines in larger type than did his colleagues. In the few cases where use of another fount with the mixed fount, within one book, is attended with use of different headline sets, we invariably find a set or sets in larger-than-text type, and usually a set or sets in text type. And perhaps we have here an indication that the remaining Scornful Lady belongs with our piracies after all, for its first section only again shows larger-than-text headlines, nineteen different ones, so help us. One further link remains, and this brings us back to Kirkman again. Four of our plays, two from each group, share a rather uncommon watermark, a peacock in his pride. They are The Maids Tragedy and A King and no King from the first group, Philaster and Band, Cuff and Ruff from the second. Three piracies, that is, and one dialogue printed for Kirkman. If, as was common, the paper was supplied by the publisher — and in Kirkman's case we know that he did so at the outset of his career and near its close 9 — this would place responsibility for the three piracies squarely on his shoulders, whoever printed them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the course of the researches which have been summarized above, it was necessary to carry out thorough bibliographical analyses on most of the works mentioned. Not all the results obtained are of equal value, and some have already been stated; but though they will of necessity make much less of a coherent whole than what has gone before, some of the more significant data obtained may perhaps be detailed here. It will be thought by some that they might better have been utilized for a series of scattered notes, but for ease of reference as well as for their evidential value in the present context it has been thought preferable to record them here, and to arrange them under the titles of the books examined. LOVES MISTRESS. This edition was obviously set from the genuine 1640 edition, but the manner in which is peculiar — though our knowledge of the ways in which compositors worked together is perhaps too scant to justify the word. The book was set in two different pica founts which alternate as follows: A3-4 v , B1-3 v , B4-C3 v , C4-D3:30 , D3:31-F1:15, F1:16-F3 v , F4-G3, G3 v -4 . G4 v was set in long primer in order to get the text into this sheet, and the same smaller fount was used to print a song in two columns on F3 v -4. In terms of the original edition printed from, the division of copy becomes hardly any clearer: A3-4 v , B1-4 v :23 thou , B4 v :23 finde-D1 v :23, D1 v :24-E2:20 , E2:21-G2:18, G2:19-H1 v :15 , H1 v :16-I2 v :2, I2 v :3-4 v . Neither division corresponds, on the whole, to clear units of the book or the text, though in the latter part of the work scene divisions do seem to play a part. If this book was cast off, and set by two compositors simultaneously, the stints would not be too unequal, but the division of the copy remains curious, especially when it comes in the middle of a line. The headlines also do not suggest a clear-cut division of work. There are eighteen of them, and they come together in formes in an apparently haphazard manner, but a manner seen in several of the plays under discussion. Though no solution is here offered, the facts seemed worth calling attention to. THE MAIDS TRAGEDY. This looks like an entirely regular production, set by two compositors, and printed on two presses, each using two skeletons. Two founts are in evidence. The mixed fount prints in sheets E-G and I, another fount, of similar face, prints in A-D and H. Of four sets of headlines, each larger than text, two print once each in sheets E-G and I, the two others in sheets A-D and H. No headline wanders into another skeleton, and there is very little switching about of headlines within the skeleton, during reimposition, although each page has a complete headline. THE TWO MERRY MILK-MAIDS. For reasons of typography and watermarks this play and Loves Mistress must have been printed at much the same time. Besides the links already noticed, the two are set up in the same two founts and in the same manner, and they use almost exactly the same number of headlines — seventeen in this case. There is the same free wandering of headlines in reimposition, although the Milk-Maids split the headline over the opening. The division of founts is as follows: B1-C1, C1 v -D1 v , D2-3 v , D4-E1 v , E2-3 v , E4-I1 , I1 v -3 v , I4-K2 , K2 v -4, K4 v , i.e. 46 pages in the one fount and 26 in the other. Both start with 9 and then 4 pages, but no clear pattern emerges. PHILASTER. Ostensibly a straightforward job, set in a single fount, and with a headline pattern much like that in The Maids Tragedy . But there are some curious headline linkages, such as the spelling PHILSATER in one headline when it prints on B4, F4 and G4, but not when it prints on C1 v , D4, E3 v , H3 v and I1 v . One such anomaly might be explained away as a coincidence, but another headline presents an exclusive B4 v -F1 link, while two others agree in linking outer C, D, E and I to the exclusion of B, F, G and H. THE PRESBYTERIAN LASH. Possibly the wildest job of all, this play uses 19 headlines for eight formes, of which three are in larger-than-text type. Three, possibly four founts are in evidence, B4:8-32 being difficult to assign: A3-B2 v , B3-B4:7 , B4:8-32, B4:33-C3:20 , (C3:21-C3 v in small type), C4-D1 v :19 , D1 v :20-D2:18, D2:19-D3:13 , D3:14-D4. The last three changes in fount occur at scene divisions. There is clear evidence of casting off, A3 and 4 v being set very widely, and B2 v ending one line short, though B3 starts with a one-line speech. THE SCORNFUL LADY, Greg 334g. On the basis that Greg 334f is the genuine 1651 edition it is possible to work out the textual relationship between the three editions with that date on the title-page. A complete collation, though showing, as always, some anomalies (none of them at all disturbing) due to coincidence, shows very clearly that 334g was set from 334f for sheets A-D, from 334h for sheets E-H. Though the number of variants is not large, it is yet too large to print the full collation here, but excerpts should be sufficient to illustrate the trend of the evidence: 334f 334g 334h A4 v 1. 4 posthorse posthorse posthorse, 7 labours labours labors 11 laught at laught at laught at at ( correct ) B1 6 kisse kisse kiss 15 with you with you you with ( correct ) 1 v 1 neere neer never E1 32 Lovelesse Loveless Loveless 35 you, indeed I you indeed, I you indeed, I shall. shall. Travel, shall Travil, Travel, ( wrong ) 41 Lady Lady Ladie 1 v faith. Will . . . sir, your faith, will . . . Sir? your faith. Will . . . sir? your ( wrong ) Since these are excerpts from a complete collation, and since evidence from spelling is always to be regarded with caution, at least in isolation, not all variants are equally illuminating, but the two in the earlier excerpt where 334g follows 334f in error against 334h's correction, and the two in the second excerpt where 334h is followed in error, though 334f is correct, are significant. One possibility, of course, must still be eliminated, but it is easy to show that 334g was printed from 334h (in its latter half) and not the other way round. Thus 334h is consistent in its proper names throughout (except for erratic lapses) when it uses a different spelling from 334f, as Loveless for Lovelesse , Abigal for Abigail , but in A-D 334g agrees with f, in E-H with h. And a particularly illuminating variant occurs at F2 v l. 9: Coach: the Coach. the Coach· the To assume that a turned point would be fortuitous at a point where the other text introduces a variant would be asking rather much of coincidence. Though the textual situation thus admits of clear exposition, it does not make the typographical situation easier to understand. Perhaps it will be simplest to set out the data: Collation: 4°, A-H4. A-C watermark: grapes running-title: The Scornful Lady . type: 20/79 mm. measure 102-3 mm. D-E watermark: name band running-title: The Scornfull Lady . * type: 20/80.5 mm. measure 99-100 mm. F-H watermark: grapes running-title: The Scornful Lady . τ type: 20/81 mm. § measure F, H 98-9 mm, G 99-100 mm. The headlines agree with the typographical division but have their own peculiarities. Sheets A-C have a distinct headline for every page, which makes 19 in all, all of them in larger-than-text type. It is perhaps simplest to assume that the headlines were set up with the text, but that does not tell us why. Sheet D occurs with two different sets 10 of headlines, of which the present writer has so far only seen one, repeated in E. THE SCORNFUL LADY. Greg 334h. This book presents several resemblances to some of those already dealt with, and if it seems possible to work out the printing history here, it should yet be borne in mind that certain basic assumptions are made, assumptions which we have become more or less accustomed to make when dealing with seventeenth-century printing, but which the books so far cited might tend to show are not perhaps so generally valid as we should like to think. The collation is the same as for the edition just described (4°, A-H 4 ), the watermark is the same throughout, and so are the printer's measure and the running-title. Two type-founts are in evidence as follows: A, B1-4 , B4 v -D1 v , D2 , D2 v -4 v , E , F, G , H: i.e. about two sheets more were printed in one fount than in the other. In the copy seen (Folger) B4 and 3 v were misimposed in one another's positions. The imposition scheme, numbering headlines in the order in which they occur in the book and recording them as they appear in the formes, runs as follows: (o) (i) (o) (i) (o) (i) A -- 3 . 2 1 D 2 13 . 7 4 F 6 4 . 7 8 -- -- . -- -- 11 6 . 3 12 13 11 . 3 1 B 7 1 . 9 8 E 5 14 . 8 6 G 10 8 . 9 10 2 4 . 5 6 9 10 . 10 9 5 9 . 12 14 C 13 10 . 13 3 H 8 5 . 7 12 12 3 . 10 11 10 9 . 13 14 The presence of 14 headlines argues for more than one press, and the presence of two type founts argues for two compositors, which, in its turn, argues for two presses as the eighth edition of a play (and a piracy at that) would hardly be printed in a small impression needing two compositors to keep up with one press. Since one of the headlines used in A (2) does not occur after D (o), we may assume that A was printed first, not last. As compositor 1 (making the assumption of 2 compositors from the two founts) set two sheets more than compositor 2 (though A was of course a small job) and was able to help compositor 2 over B by setting B4 v (compositor 2 subsequently reciprocating by setting D2 — there is no indication that setting was by formes), we may think that A was finished well before B, so that press-work began well before B. Assuming that a logical sequence was followed, we should then conclude that the two formes of A were machined concurrently, since the A(o) headline next occurs in a forme machined on press 1 (i.e. the press for which compositor 1 is assumed to have worked) and the two A (i) headlines in a forme machined by press 2. This would mean that the formes of B were machined concurrently with those of C, those of D with E, those of F with G, and, ideally, the two formes of H again machined together. In fact we find that the headlines on C, both inner and outer, exclude the possibility that its formes were machined concurrently with any others than those of B or A(i). Further, though no such general exclusions exist for the other formes, we find that the formes of D and E are mutually exclusive in their headlines, and those for F and G equally so except that F(i) and G(o) cannot have been at press together, as both use headline 8. But the two formes of H are again mutually exclusive, and H(o) is in fact imposed with the last skeleton worked on press (2) although it had been set by compositor 1. The printing can then be reconstructed as follows: G(o) and H(o) are from the same skeleton, so G(o) would have immediately preceded H(o). G(o) shares half its skeleton with G(i) and three-fourths with E(i) and E(o), but probability would choose G(i) as the preceding forme. Since G(i) shares three-fourths of the skeleton with E(o), and E(i) again three-fourths with B(i), there is some reason to suppose that the order of printing was B, E, G, H(o), inner forme preceding outer. A(i) would then naturally take its place before B(i), where both its headlines reappear. We might reverse the order in B, which is immaterial. If this sequence is taken as established, certain consequences follow. C, as we have seen, must have been printed concurrently with A(i) and/or B(i,o), so that we might tentatively place A(o), C(i), C(o) parallel with A(i), B(i), B(o). The order in C is again immaterial, but we may think that D(i) has (12, 3) together because they were together in C(o), though on similar grounds (13, 11) we might advocate C(o), C(i), D(o), D(i). But we also note that F(o) takes over three headlines from D(o), including 6, which also appears in E(i), and that since F(i) has 8, it would have been printed before G(o) and after E(i), while F(i), having (7, 3), would have been printed after D(i), and D(i) — (7, 4) —after B(o). The only way of meeting these conditions is by positing an order D(i), D(o), F(i), F(o), printed concurrently, forme for forme, with E(i), E(o), G(i), G(o). We are then left with H(i), which may reasonably be placed after F(o) on press 1, to give each press eight formes and make them finish together: A(o) C(i) C(o) D(i) D(o) F(i) F(o) H(i) 1 -- 3 13 3 13 10 7 4 2 13 7 8 6 4 7 12 -- -- 10 11 12 3 3 12 11 6 3 1 13 11 13 14 2 1 9 8 7 1 8 6 5 14 9 10 10 8 8 5 2 -- -- 5 6 2 4 10 9 9 10 12 14 5 9 10 9 A(i) B(i) B(o) E(i) E(o) G(i) G(o) H(o) We may be surprised at the setting up of headline 14 as late as E(o), when headlines 1, 8 were left on the bench (presumably D(i) had not yet been broken up), but then 12 was set up for C(o) when 11 must have been available (or vice versa if we reverse the order). A convincing answer to this riddle, which is anything but unique at this time, were a thing devoutly to be wished — but until we have one for 12 we had better not worry over 14.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * This study is based on research done while the author was the holder of a Folger Fellowship and a Fulbright grant. A preliminary account was read to the Society on 18 November 1955. 1 Not all copies of the Chronicle have the catalogue and advertisement at the end, some having merely a catalogue of publications of Henry Marsh, while others may have had a similar list for the third member of the responsible syndicate, Henry Brome. The Gibson entry for the book is not clear. A copy in Dr. Williams's Library is listed as having the catalogue, but the advertisement is not mentioned. The present writer has only seen the Folger copy. Another copy indeed figures in the Library of Congress catalogue, and hence in Wing and Gibson, but it has not been seen these eight and twenty years. 2 The Elder Brother and The Scornful Lady have, of course, only one entry each. 3 The incidence of the titling caps varies greatly, some books having very few, while later books have many more. Perhaps this indicates that several cases of the fount were in use, which had not been equally contaminated. 4 There is a suggestion that Tom Tyler has the later state among the three occurrences, but the apparent damage which the I there shows in some copies is not distinctive enough to be certain. 5 Fredson Bowers, "The First Series of Plays Published by Francis Kirkman in 1661", The Library , 5th ser., II (1947-48), 289-291. 6 The Spanish Gipsie (Wing M 1988), which occurs with a variant title listing Kirkman as the publisher instead of Robert Crofts, and with a similarly variant advertisement on K2 v , has no place in this inquiry. 7 Though this practice is not so frequent as the other, seen for instance in Loves Mistress , of using smaller type at the end in order to avoid overrunning the sheet by half a page or so, other instances can be cited. One, in Locke's Two Treatises of Government , 1690, has already been the subject of controversy. Another, both more interesting and less ambiguous, occurs in the 1650 edition of Howell's Epistolœ Ho-Elianœ . There the compositor, resetting in a different format, first changes from his usual long primer to pica, and finally even to english, in order to make his link from E to 2A. 8 Note the collation of the Chronicle : 8°, i 2 , a 8 (—a1), A-O 8 , and then also note the arrangement in Griffith, published by Johnson, and certainly set up in the same shop as the Beggars Bush group, with A, B, E and F set by one man and C, D, G and H by the other (80: A-G8, H4(—H3, 4).) 9 Kirkman mentions his buying paper for Jane Bell when she printed Amadis de Gaule and Clerio and Lozia for him, and complains that when Thomas Johnson died, his housekeeper concealed his death and made away with all Kirkman's white paper, to the tune of £10. And one has only to look at books published by such a man as Moseley to see where the paper came from. Buck's Richard III was printed by three printers — but all use the same paper. And the Beaumont and Fletcher first folio was printed by as many as seven or eight printers who all start out on the same paper and all, if they change to a different paper, change to the same paper. * E3 v cornfull .

      <field name="heading_text">The First Editions of The Good Natur'd Man and She Stoops to Conquer by William B. Todd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN THIS STUDY I ATTEMPT TO DISTINGUISH, AS SIMPLY as the complexities will allow, the several variants of Goldsmith's two plays. 1 Such an account necessarily includes an array of points not only in the impressions commonly regarded as of the original octavo edition but in every subsequent impression, each of which, whether labelled the "second" or the "fifth," is also part of the first edition. From this wider perspective it will be seen that previous surveys have too often mistaken the exception for the rule (an error which, of course, makes every normal copy another exception), overlooked a number of concealed "editions" (i.e., impressions), asserted as the proper sequence of variants one running contrary to the evident order of impressions, 2 and inferred from all this as quite "haphazard" a combination of sheets which proves to be entirely regular. To each sequence there are indeed some few exceptions, but these may now be dismissed as the mixtures occasionally resulting either from the rapid succession of issues at the time of printing or from intrusions of much later date. Whatever the occasion, they are, at best, merely aberrations from the normal order and thus, in any representative account, of no significance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Good Natur'd Man Within a year of its publication in 1768 Goldsmith's first play ran through five impressions, two of which are unlabelled, two called a "New Edition," and one described, not inappropriately, as a "Fifth Edition." The first was announced in the Public Advertiser on Friday 5 February and another promised in the same paper on the following Tuesday. The first large impression of the new comedy of the Good Natured Man, written by Dr. Goldsmith, being sold off on Saturday last, a new edition will be published this afternoon at three o'clock; when those ladies and gentlemen that were then disappointed of their books may be supplied by W. Griffin, in Catherine Street in the Strand. Since the reference here is specifically to a "new edition" I presume that the one offered at 3 p.m. was the earliest printing so distinguished on its title, or the third impression in this sequence. If so, the second, undesignated impression must have been prepared as a supplement to the "large impression" and may therefore have appeared on Saturday, the day after publication. That it was so designed is evident from its construction, representing for five gatherings (A-C, I-K) an overprint of the first run through the press, for one (L) a mixture of states identical with those in the original printing, and for the remaining five (D-H) a new impression from standing type. Only in this last section are there any signs of reprinting, evident here both in the press figures and in textual corrections. 3 Following its notice of the one "New Edition" the Advertiser has no other reference until the 22d of February, when it lists another "New Edition, being the fourth" or, in our terminology, the fourth in the series of impression. Both of these "New" and the later "Fifth Edition" were reimpressed throughout and contain numerous revisions. Through all impressions the most extensive revision occurs in the final gathering L 2 . Here there are two series of alterations, one affecting the first two immediately related impressions, the other the last and separate three. In the one sequence the compositor juggles a note which Goldsmith belatedly supplied for the epilogue on page [75], appending it first at the bottom of the page (state b ), then—to justify the register—transposing it with the last four lines of verse to the top of the next page (state c ), and finally—to realign the note with its reference—returning it to [75] and displacing four more lines of verse to the next page (state d ). Since with the exception of b all of these shifts involve both sides of the final leaf, it is obvious that, with the same exception, none of these alterations were made at press. Otherwise, in half-sheet imposition, the perfection of sheets on the same forme would produce here (as in the other play) a combination of two unrelated states. After settling the troublesome note, the compositor provided for the later impressions a second setting (B) to replace some other matter that had previously occupied the available space in chase L. For the imposition of quarters in octavo the customary layout, as described by Stower, 4 is in parallel ranges or, in this circumstance: When the sheets are perfected end to end , according to normal procedure, the letter of one setting is always kept apart from the other. For the third impression, however, this sheet apparently was perfected side to side , a maneuver which can be permitted only when, as in this case, the letter is in duplicate. Resulting from this are two further alterations in the gathering, one with the outer "forme" of A perfected upon the inner of B: state e A73 B74 B75 A76 the other with the outer of B perfected upon the inner of A: state f B73 A74 A75 B76 Both of these occur, I believe, only in the third (or first "New") impression. In the last two impressions each of these settings was imposed separately, B alone, apparently, being used for the fourth (state g ) and A alone for the fifth (state h ). In each of these the final line of the epilogue, previously reading And view with favour, the Good-natur'd Man. is altered to read And be each critick the Good-natur'd Man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She Stoops to Conquer Within a year of its publication in 1773 Goldsmith's last play ran through six impressions, two of which, as in the other performance, are unlabelled, the next called either the "Second" or "Third," the one following not improperly termed the "Fourth Edition," and the fifth and sixth both described as a "Fifth Edition." On Tuesday 23 March the London Evening-Post promised the first edition "On Thursday next," a notice confirmed the next day in the Daily Advertiser , which indicated that it would be ready "Tomorrow, at Four o'Clock." Very probably, then, the original issue was on the 25th, one day earlier than that usually assigned. From 27 March through 13 May there are many other advertisements, but as these invariably report "New Editions" they are of little use in determining the chronology of numbered impressions. 5 All work on this play was divided between two shops. Gatherings A to K apparently were the responsibility of William Griffin (the avowed printer of The Good Natur'd Man ), whose pressmen, as usual, identified themselves as 1, 2, and 3. In this section at least two compositors may also be distinguished, the first setting gatherings A-D in 8.8 cm. measure with headlines reading ": Or ," the second setting E-K in 8.6 cm. measure with headline ";Or,". Gatherings L-P were assigned to other, unidentified personnel who printed without figures and set uniformly in 8.4 cm. measure with headline (in its second state) reading ";OR". Apart from the title, which exhibits several variants adequately described in the accompanying Table, Griffin's section illustrates certain features requiring separate notice. One phenomenon not as yet recorded in recent studies of press figures is the recurrence of identical marks through numerous impressions. 6 In this section there are, at the outset, three such impressions, two of a different state throughout, and the third in process of further correction. Each of these, it may be supposed, was successively printed from A to K and then returned to the printer first assigned the job. Thus at three definite intervals Griffin's men machined the same formes, no. 1 undertaking B, presumably, as well as F and K; no. 2 working C, G, and H; and no. 3 working D, E, and I. Thereafter, as shown in the Table, other combinations appear, some of which also persist through two or more impressions. Only gatherings E and F, however, are machined by the same men through all six impressions. Gathering I, though worked throughout by 3, is of a new setting in the last impression. As the selected readings in the Table also indicate, Griffin had, besides his three industrious pressmen, a very officious corrector who was especially adept in pointing the ha ha ha's after every witticism. Once we find him so engaged in the third impression, when he looked over the sheets from both shops, and once again in the fourth. While engaged upon this great enterprise, however, he neglected to observe that on page 13 last line of the fourth impression, the phrase hitherto reading No offence; but question had since been pied and the loose sorts hastily jammed in the forme to produce No offenbu; ß&amp;c.nv; tquesti on This curious mishap, occurring perhaps when no. 2 withdrew his figure from the page at the conclusion of the third impression, went unnoticed through all succeeding pulls of the fourth and fifth before it was amended in the sixth. Though Griffin managed to keep his own work under control, the cast off portion sent to the other shop was soon mangled to a state almost beyond repair. Most of the trouble resulted, I suspect, from Griffin's belated or ambigous instructions concerning headlines, signatures, and page numbers. 7 At first all the other printer had to go on, it would seem, was a provisional title and some vague remark to the effect that the first shop was setting "up to the ninth gathering." This advice could be variously interpreted either as an inclusive count starting from B, the first sheet of text (the sense intended by Griffin), or as an exclusive count starting from A, the first sheet in the book (as understood by his collaborator). Proceeding from this mistaken assumption, the other printer then calculated eight numbers to a half-sheet and arranged his figures with the other data in an order beginning [page 1] A COMEDY. 65 I [pages 2|3] 66 THE MISTAKES OF A NIGHT; | A COMEDY. 67 I2 When a certain number of L in this state (and of M in the comparable state) had been wrought off, the printer was informed that while the title he entered in the headline once had been considered, it was now superseded by another. 8 Moreover, he was advised, this run of signatures was "two gatherings behind." If so, he reasoned, the figures must also be two gatherings or 16 numbers behind, and all references were accordingly arranged as THE MISTAKES OF A NIGHT. 81 L 82 SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER; OR | THE MISTAKES OF A NIGHT. 83 L2 In this second state the printing of L and M was concluded and the invariant series N-P impressed. Only then was it realized that the page numbers in the other section started from B and therefore, in the example cited, should run 73, 74, 75. Thus one final alteration was required and eventually entered, as a third state, in the full series L-P of the next impression. From the two earlier states it is now possible to determine the nature of the several variants within L and M of the first impression. Since no copies appear entirely in the first state but a certain number entirely in the second, it is evident that the correction was made before the end of printing on white paper, a circumstance which, by half-sheet imposition, produces three variants. In abbreviated form these may be identified and described as Page and signature, first 2 rectos Variant Type L gathering M gathering x outer in 1st state perfected upon inner in 2d 65 I 83 L2 73 K 91 M2 y inner in 1st state perfected upon outer in 2d 81 L 67 I2 89 M 75 K2 z both formes in 2d state 81 L 83 L2 89 M 91 M2 From the constant association of comparable variants in L and M it would also appear that these two signatures were imposed together, with the inner (or outer) forme of each within the same chase and the two chases worked simultaneously. If the correction was made about two-thirds of the way through white paper, the remainder then run off in the corrected state, and the two heaps thereafter exchanged for the reiteration, the press working the combined inner formes would turn out first a certain number of L-M sheets in variant z and then twice as many in x , and the press working outer formes an equivalent number in z and again twice as many in y . Though all totals would be doubled when the sheets were sected for binding, there would still be, in this hypothesis, as in the copies I have examined, an approximately equal number of each variant.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 An attempt made, I should add, not without considerable assistance from Mr. David F. Foxon of the British Museum, Mr. Herbert Cahoon of the Pierpont Morgan Library, Miss Barbara D. Simison of the Yale Library, and Professor Arthur Friedman of the University of Chicago. Even this good advice, however, cannot remove the possibility that one or two among the several hundred points cited here may have wandered into the wrong category, and I would be very grateful for any notice of these strays. 2 Among the variants listed for GNM in the standard bibliography, no. 1 page 24 seems to occur only in the second and later impressions, 2-3 pages 43, 48 in the second but the related 1-2 page 44 only in the first, and 1-2 page 51 in reverse order. For SSC the titles are inaccurately distinguished, the 2 (of 3 possible) points for page 8 given apparently in reverse order, 5th point for L gathering a possibility but not seen in any copies, and 2d point for P actually a defective specimen of the 3d. The four copies described by Scott appear to be completely regular; but the copy of SSC cited by Wise ( Ashley Library , X, 115-116), along with various remarks on the integrity of one listed by Scott, is itself mixed—though not, apparently, by his own hand. Wise's example, advanced as a second copy, would seem to be the very one previously, and less accurately described in volume 2 of his Ashley Library , pp. 150-151. 3 Gathering G also presents, I believe, the only instance of deterioration within an impression. In all but the earliest copies of the second the ink balls have dislodged at various times the word "let" in "now let it" (42.3), the L in Lofty (45.1), and both the L and t in another Lofty (45.29), all sorts in a forme unlocked and corrected before the beginning of this run. 4 The Printer's Grammar (1808), p. 173. 5 There are, however, at least two later "New" editions, one in 1785 containing with new preliminaries a reissue of 1773 remainders, and another in 1786 completely reset. 6 Two remarkable examples of this practice, Sheridan's Pizarro and Erskine's View of the Present War with France , are now under study for a later report. If other points may be counted in lieu of invariant figures, the one piece over a fifteen-year interval appears to have gone through 30 impressions or "editions," the other in one year through no less than 35. 7 In this as in other studies I now venture to propose reasonable causes for what are commonly regarded as inexplicable "mistakes." If suppositions are to be avoided I would, at this point, refer the reader to the strictly factual, essentially correct, and most entertaining account given by Mr. Iolo Williams in the London Mercury , XI (1924), 82-86. 8 Through 13 March the London Evening-Post lists the first title; thereafter the second. 1 As compared with Scott facsimile, NN (Berg) copy has upper rule bent at both ends. 2 Except for the one above imprint in variants b and c , all rules in each variant are different and not, as has been supposed, several distortions of the same thing. 3 The price line in 2d impression has been transferred to the new half-title. 4 In his Ashley Library (X. 116) Wise asserts that one of the copies described by Scott, here identified as a , is merely an example of his 'first issue' c with title supplied from the 2d impression. Scott's own facsimiles, however, prove the contrary.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Unrecorded Coleridge Variants by David V. Erdman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHILE PURSUING COLERIDGE'S CAREER through the pages of the Cambridge Intelligencer , the Morning Chronicle , the Morning Post , the Monthly Magazine , and the Courier , I have unearthed so many variant readings and unexpected occurrences of verses not hitherto recorded that it has seemed advisable to make all these available in a brief chronological report. To be usefully inclusive I have also collated all the periodical publication of Coleridge's verse up through 1820 (with exceptions to be noted). And in the same list I have taken occasion to notice certain poems not previously collected, though their attribution to Coleridge will require a separate and fairly elaborate demonstration. To these Professor Robert D. Mayo has enabled me to add a report of two Coleridge poems, "Absence: An Ode" and "Absence: A Poem," which he has recently discovered in the Sherborne Weekly Entertainer of 1793. The standard Oxford edition, edited by Ernest Hartley Coleridge in 1912, of The Complete Poetical Works in two volumes or The Poems in one volume (identical in congruent portions), has all the appearance of a thorough collation, and I trust it may be so for manuscript sources (except in such clearly editorially determined matters as the capitalization or non-capitalization of personifiable nouns). In his preface the editor promises "to furnish the student with an exhaustive summary of various readings," and he defends the supplying of an "exhaustive table of variants" however apparently trifling or accidental. He does indeed record what are intended to be complete newspaper variants whenever the fact of newspaper publication is known to him—with the exception of the Ode to the Rain , supposed to have appeared in an issue of the Morning Post that is missing from the British Museum file. There is a legend, however, that E. H. Coleridge did not do all the newspaper collations himself, and it becomes evident that whoever assisted him sometimes let him down. Rather considerable variants of some poems have been overlooked, and the report of minor textual variants is especially careless for the earlier part of the period covered. Patent typographical errors (e.g. "freeze" for "breeze") have been emended silently even in the table of supposed variants—with the effect of contradicting Coleridge's statements that certain poems were badly printed. And in at least one instance what purport to be variants from a newspaper seem to be merely compiled from one of the manuscripts. Furthermore the discovery of several poems appearing at dates not noted makes it evident that no systematic examination of the periodical files has ever been made. Anything like an orderly search could hardly have missed the 148-line "Fragment by S. T. Coleridge" of The Visions of the Maid of Orleans , for instance. It seems to have been a matter of editorial policy to disregard variations in spelling, punctuation, and other mechanics; yet it is disconcerting to find differences in line indention, in spelling ("clothes" for "cloathes," "tease" for "teize"), and capitalization ("Earth" for "earth" or "remorse" for "Remorse") —even in what purport to be separate transcriptions of the text "as first printed in the Morning Post " or in texts derived uniquely from the newspaper printing. Of rather greater importance is the almost regular neglect of pseudonyms, signatures, or anonymity. Only after the present investigation will it be possible to compile a biography of Coleridge as "Albert," "Laberius," "Cuddy," etc., or variously "S.T.C.," "ESTEESI," and "EΣTHΣE." Again, in the E. H. Coleridge text, the titles actually used in periodical publication are often neglected, or titles are given to poems which had none. The present tabulation, while not claimed to be without its own errors of transcription, is intended to supply all variants in text, title, and signature (not spelling and mechanics, though these are privately available to anyone contemplating an edition) needed to correct the E. H. Coleridge table of variants of all Coleridge poems printed in periodicals from 1793 through 1820—not including the Watchman , the Friend , the Annual Anthology , or Felix Farley's Bristol Journal . My concern is with poems or versions first published in periodicals and not with mere reprintings, although for the four newspapers carefully surveyed, the Intelligencer , Chronicle , Post , and Courier , all items have been attended to. Thus, with the exceptions just noted, all items in E. H. Coleridge's list No. I of "Poems first published in newspapers or periodicals" and No. II of "Epigrams and jeux d'esprit" (pp. 1178-1180) have been collated. But I have not dealt with his list No. III of "Poems included in anthologies and other works" (except to make one addition for 1803) nor made any search for reprints in other periodicals or for poems quoted in reviews. It has seemed advisable, however, to list, even when variants are not involved, the few further newspaper printings mentioned in E. H. Coleridge's notes but not in his lists I and II; also to notice poems not accepted by E. H. Coleridge though assigned to Coleridge by earlier editors. To bring the record up to date I have added two publications of poems in the Courier and New Times discovered by Professor Thomas M. Raysor in 1930; also a first publication of Genevieve as an "Irregular Sonnet" in the Morning Chronicle and three new epigrams in the Monthly Magazine discovered by Professor Earl Leslie Griggs in 1954. Undated items which I have not located are: "On a Late Connubial Rupture," said to have been reprinted in Felix Farley's Bristol Journal , and "To a Friend who had declared his intention of writing no more poetry," said to have appeared "in a Bristol newspaper." Professor Carl R. Woodring, having made an independent collation of most of the newspaper poems, has now checked through the present list and has improved it with several corrections and suggestions. In the course of this survey it was suggested to me that the possibility of duplicate composition of the newspapers in question must be taken into account, and accordingly I made an effort to collate all extant copies noted in William S. Ward's recent and nearly exhaustive Index and Finding List of Serials Published in the British Isles, 1789-1832 (University of Kentucky Press, 1953). The point is that before the introduction of the steam press in 1814 the rate of printing did not normally exceed 250 impressions an hour, so that there had to be more than one setting of type for a daily newspaper if more copies were needed than could be printed on one press in eight or ten hours, i.e. 2000-2500 copies—or, by halfsheet imposition, 4000-5000 copies. Presumably the weekly Cambridge Intelligencer (circulation not known) would never have required duplicate setting. And presumably the Morning Chronicle in 1793-1795 and the Morning Post in 1797-1802 (their Coleridge years) would not have required it for their normal circulations. The Morning Post in 1802 boasted that its circulation had risen "from 400 to 2100 per day" between 1795 and 1801 and again "from 2100 to 3500 per day" by December 3, 1802. The circulation of the Morning Chronicle dropped below 2000 in 1802 and had probably not exceeded 3000 in the preceding decade. None of these figures approaches the critical limit, if halfsheet imposition was practicable. ( The Times is said to have used duplicate setting when the circulation exceeded 4500 copies, as it did not do before 1806.) But bibliographical information about the newspapers is so scanty that a thorough check was advised. (I am grateful to Eugene B. Vest and Gerald E. Bentley, Jr. for help with some of the collating.) Files of the Cambridge Intelligencer in the British Museum (Duke University film), Oxford, and the University of Chicago were collated, leaving unexamined only the file at the Cambridge Public Library. Files of the Morning Chronicle in Oxford, the Boston Public Library (Duke University film), and the University of Chicago were collated, leaving unexamined only one extensive file, the one at Cambridge University. Files of the Morning Post in the British Museum (Duke University film), Oxford, the New York Historical Library, and the Newberry Library in Chicago were examined, leaving only the file which is listed in Ward as at Richmond, Virginia, but cannot now be located. In all cases the texts examined, in which typographical peculiarities such as broken letters were frequently noted, proved to be identical. The evidence appears conclusive that duplicate composition was not practised by the newspapers concerned at the dates in question. It thus seems safe to conclude that apparent errors in E. H. Coleridge are actual errors and not variants derived from variant printings. The few poems appearing in the Courier (on eleven scattered days between 1804 and 1818) are with one exception correctly collated by E. H. Coleridge; so the possibility that in the latter half of that period the Courier reached a circulation requiring multiple setting hardly concerns us. I have collated two or three copies for each of the days for which that many copies were available and found no variation, except that the Courier sometimes went into a "Second Edition" with one or two news paragraphs refreshed. Finally a word should be said about the text of the poems reprinted in 1850 in Sara Coleridge's third volume of Coleridge's Essays on His Own Times . Although she claims to be reprinting these "as they originally appeared," her text is sometimes that of 1817 ( Recantation and Parliamentary Oscillators ); sometimes a doctored text (in "Hippona" the third line, "Whate'er obscenities you say," becomes "Whate'er men over boldly say"); but usually a text changed only in mechanics (for example The Devil's Thoughts and most of the Epigrams). In spelling and punctuation she is more faithful than E. H. Coleridge to the newspaper, and her text does not seem to account for any of his errors.</field>

The still later draft published in 1796, Lines on an Autumnal Evening (pp. 51-54) makes some use of the WE version but often reverts to that of 1792.

Three sonnets, each signed "Nehemiah Higginbottom." E.H.C. (pp. 209-211) collates titles and text properly—except for a mechanical matter of some historical interest, the use of italics and capital letters in Sonnet I (the other two being unvaried in this respect). Since Coleridge's aim was parody of "favourite phrases" and of "flat lines forced into poetry by Italics," it is of some interest to know which words bore emphasis in the earliest printing, and which received emphasis only in subsequent texts. In MM . the only italicized words are: 5 dampy , 13 one . . . no ; the only capitalized words are: 9 Sorrow, 10 myself, 11 spirit. The same is true of the reprinting in the Poetical Register for 1803 (1805). In the Biographia Literaria , 1817, a self-conscious Coleridge reprinted the sonnet with added italics and capitals thus: 1 hard world 2 my poor heart . . . Moon 6 paly 7 did pause me 8 mused me . . . wretched ones 11 soothe . . . breezy 14 my poor heart's inexplicable Swell. At the same time he dropped Sorrow and spirit to plain sorrow and spirit. (All this is faithfully reproduced in the J. Shawcross edition of Biographia Literaria [1907], I, 17.) Cottle, in the first posthumous reprinting, emphasized only: MYSELF, SPIRIT, one . . . no-thing , and later editors generally followed suit. James Dykes Campbell in 1893 restored dampy but reduced Sorrow, Myself, Spirit to simple capitalization. E.H.C. restores the emphases of 1817 with a careless hand, neglecting to italicize breezy and my (line 11) while adding an italic I in line 7, dropping Moon down to Moon and Swell to swell, and tampering thus with lines 9 and 11: 9 O'er the black heath of Sorrow MM O'er the bleak [sic] heath of sorrow 1817 O'er the black heath of Sorrow E.H.C. 11 sooth Spirit . . . breezy wood MM soothe spirit . . . breezy wood 1817 sooth Spirit . . . breezy wood E.H.C.

MP . The Visions of the Maid of Orleans. A Fragment, by S. T. COLERIDGE . "If there be Beings of a higher class than Man." 148 lines. This is an important find. It corresponds to the portion of The Destiny of Nations , lines 127-277, referred to in E. H. C. (pp. 131, 136) as "Coleridge's unpublished poem of 1796 ( The Visions of the Maid of Orleans )" supposed not to have appeared in print until 1817, in Sibylline Leaves . The 1817 text (lines as numbered in E. H. C.) proves to have been considerably emended, generally for the better. It is curious to see "sweltry" deriving from "sultry" and to find that "The crisp milk frozen on its innocent lips" (line 215) is not mentioned in the earlier account of the babe. The variants follow, except for mechanical ones, which may be dismissed with the observation that such nouns as "Spirit," "Sloth," and "Pity" are not capitalized in MP , though on the other hand "huntress" and "maid" (usually) are. 132 choose their human ministers from such states 1817 ] chuse their servants from such mean estates MP 134 Repelled from all the minstrelsies 1817 ] Disdain'd by all the minstrelcies MP 135 palace-roof and soothe the monarch's 1817 ] palace roof, soothing the Monarch's MP 139 infant] childish MP 150-153 The sweltry man . . .

The discovery of these 148 lines, plus the 48 lines of the poem next listed, gives a much better appearance to the credit side of Coleridge's ledger for the first month of his regular employment in the "poetical department" of the Morning Post at a guinea a week. It used to be supposed that after the miserable Lines of December 7 and the 13-line Melancholy of the 12th nothing further was supplied before the two meager epigrams of January 2d. We have learned that Wordsworth helped out with The Convict December 14. And now we can add this handsome Joan of Arc fragment (actually that part of Coleridge's long poem liked by Charles Lamb) as well as the following sizable and fresh political satire: * Dec. 30. MP . To Sir John Sinclair, Alderman Lushington, and the whole Troop of Parliamentary Oscillators. Signed "laberius." 48 lines. Republished a week later, Jan. 6, in CI , with an addition to the title of the name "S. Thornton."

According to Coleridge ( Letters , I, 320) this was "horribly misprinted," but E. H. C. (pp. 335-338) silently corrects the errors in his table of MP variants, thus leaving the impression that Coleridge was fibbing. The howlers were two pairs of reversed rime-words: lines 25 and 28 "finely-fibred flame" and "lambent frame"; lines 72 and 74 "aspect sweet" riming with "communions sweet" instead of "fleet." That was all, but horrible enough. (In the third line of the Motto, E. H. C. reads "preservst" for "preserv'd.") 1800 * Sept. 27. CI . The Dungeon (From the Lyrical Ballads) . Unsigned.

H. C. (as punctuation and capitalization indicate) and even borrow the E. H. C. title without indicating that there is no title in the Words-worth MS.

Collation yields an introductory letter, some extra lines, and a long footnote containing an excerpt from Coleridge's translation of Wallenstein , followed in turn by another note. The introduction reads: Mr. Editor, The following Verses were composed before daylight, on the morning appointed for the departure of a very worthy, but not very pleasant, visitor; whom, it was feared, the rain might detain. If you give it a place in your paper, it must be under the title of AN ODE TO THE RAIN. In the text Rain is always in capitals. Between lines 18 and 19 an extra couplet is found: 18-19 [We] but ill agree: For days and months, and almost years 1817 . as ill agree As fun'ral hymn with Fal de ral : The Lord in Heav'n knows, when we shall! For days, etc. MP . All other variants are merely in mechanics. But to "You're *" in line 32 is appended the following: * Here is seems that the Poet, in a dreamlike mood of mind, well suited to a Poet composing verses in the dark with his eyes shut, begins to confound, and gradually to identify, the personified Rain with the person of the visitor. If authority were wanting, it might be found in the first scene of the last act of Wallenstein, where the idea of the planet, Jupiter, is confounded with that of the young hero, who, as well as Wallenstein, was born under that star. The whole passage is incomparably superior to any other of all Schiller's Works. O si sic omnia . The passage is short, and deserves quotation: (Wallenstein at the window .) There is a busy motion in the heav'n, etc. [ sic ] The passage corresponds to Wallenstein , Act. V, Sc. i., lines 23-49 as published in 1800, with only one material variant: 25 Fast sail the clouds 1800 ] Fast sweep MP The punctuation differs greatly; the stage directions are omitted between lines 31 and 32; and the passage from line 38 to line 49 is telescoped to: Countess . How? Wallenstein —He is gone—is dust! Countess .—Thou speak'st of Piccolomini, &amp;c. The note on "sickle" in line 25 does not appear, but at the end of the excerpt the following paragraph takes up the point made in that note: If we recollect, that Wallenstein acted through the whole of his life, under the strongest influence of an astrological superstition, we shall not find it easy to admire this passage too highly. Some sapient Critics have charged the metaphor in the third and fourth lines of this quotation with an incongruity; but this must surely have been the consequence of their having neither seen the crescent moon in a cloudy, windy night, or a bright sickle at work in a corn field. A simile with greater similitude would scarcely be poetic. (A pleasant addition to Coleridge's dicta on moons and similes.) Oct. 9. MP. Epitaph to a Mercenary Miser . * Signed EΣTHΣE. (E. H. C., p. 967). Oct. 11. MP. Original Epigrams. Lot II . Signed, at the end, "EΣTHΣE." Eight epigrams (E. H.

(p. 386) overlooks "blackbird" in place of "Linnet" in line 2. This supports the hypothesis of George Whalley ( Coleridge and Sara Hutchinson [1955], pp. 7-8) that the text in "Sara's Poets" is earlier than that in Mp . It has not only "Blackbird" for "Linnet" but "Chaffinch" for "Sparrow" and "green Earth" for "green fields." All these changes move in a characteristic direction. 1803 * The Poetical Register and Repository of Fugitive Poetry, for 1802 (London, 1803), p. 372. epigram, from the german of lessing. 2 lines, unsigned. This is a variant of the 4-line Epigram, "Bob now resolves on marriage schemes to trample," which E. H. C. gives (p. 953) as "now first published from an MS." He traces it to Lessing's Sinnegedicht No. 93. You hesitate if you shall take a wife: Do as your father did—live single all your life. 1804 *April 1. MM . "From off that delicate fair cheek." Headed "Cantabrigiana. CLXIV.— By a student of Jesus college." 14 lines. Discovered and reprinted by Earl Leslie Griggs ( MLN , LXIX [1954], 27-31, also in Collected Letters , II, 1092) with this which immediately follows: *April 1. MM. Epigram .— By the same . "Dear Anne . . ." April 16. C. The Exchange of Hearts . *Signed "S. T. C." (E. H. C., p. 391). *June 1. MM. Balsamum in vitro . Headed "CLXXIV.— By a Student of Jesus ." Discovered and reprinted by Griggs (see April 1 above). (The three MM poems are among "Cantabrigiana" sent in by George Dyer.) 1806 Sept. 12. C. *lines on a king-and-emperor-making emperor and king, altered from the 93d sonnet of fulk greville, the friend of sir philip sydney. * Signed "Civis." E. H. C. (p. 1116) garbles the title and the text: 1 we] were C 9 makes ] moves C 12 will laugh ] inly laughs C It is a curious fact that E. H. C. first published the text and signature of this poem perfectly in "Lord Brooke and S. T. Coleridge," The Athenaeum , April 25, 1903, p. 531. Sept. 26. MP. IMPROMPTU, the different sensations produced in france, by the death of two late public characters. " Our Nation's Foes lament on FOX's death." Unsigned. E. H. C. (p. 971) accepts the attribution of this quatrain to Coleridge on very shaky evidence. He forgets that Coleridge was connected not with the MP but with the Courier in 1806. He takes his text from Byron's Fugitive Pieces , capitalizing "let Sense and Truth unclue," though there are no capitals in the original, and then suggests that Coleridge "veiled his initials in the line, 'Let Sense and Truth unClue.'" The idiom "lament on" does not sound to me like Coleridge; I quite doubt the ascription. Incidentally the last line should read: " We give the palm where Justice points it due" (not "its due"). Sept. 27. C. Farewell to Love . * Signed "C." E. H. C. (pp. 402-403) gives variants correctly except for spelling and punctuation. Again (see above) his Athenaeum article noted the signature; also signature "S. T. Coleridge" of reprint in Gentleman's Magazine , November 1815. E. H. C. also notes a reprint, apparently unsigned, in the Morning Herald , Oct. 11, 1806, which I have been unable to collate. 1811 Aug. 30. C. The Virgin's Cradle-Hymn . Unsigned. Given correctly in E. H. C. (pp. 417-418) but for omission after "a few notes" of the words: "I send you the words, with an English Imitation:" 1812 *May 4. C. [ Love. ] 3 stanzas quoted with the following note: Mr. Dawe has a large picture from Coleridge's Poem of 'Love,' and a spirited chalk drawing of Mr. Coleridge, together with a bust of great merit. The Poem was much admired by the late Mr. Fox, who called it in a letter the most pleasing Poem in the English language. It may be found in Walter Scott's Selection, published by Ballantyne [ English Minstrelsy , 1810]. The Stanzas from which the Picture is taken are the following: Quoted are lines 21-24, 33-40 (E. H. C. pp. 332-333). Text agrees with English Minstrelsy in line 22 ("sung" for "sang") but changes "suited" to "fitted" in line 23 and "The ruins" to "The ruin" in line 24. Coleridge, in the Courier office, probably supplied both text and note. And see next item . *Aug. 15. C. Genevieve . "by mr. coleridge." "All thoughts, all passions, all delights" ( Love , E. H. C. pp. 330-335.) Not to be confused with the sonnet called Genevieve . Discovery of this Genevieve version of the poem usually called Love resolves the riddle of Thomas Moore's remark about the beauty but sensuality of "the 'Genevieve.'" (See Elisabeth Schneider, PMLA , LXX [1955], 425n.) The text is a transition between the texts of 1800 and 1828. It varies from the final E.H.C. text thus: 13 leant] lean'd C 15 lay] harp C 22 sang] sung C 23 suited] fitted C 42 that] this C 54 leaped] leapt C 59 expiate] extirpate C 74 An] And C 78 virgin-shame] maiden shame C 93 fears] tears C Mechanics vary, of course; "love" and "lady of the land" and "bride" are not capitalized, but "Knight" is (even in line 14). Stanzas 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 18, 19, 20 are enclosed by inverted commas, which the following footnote explains: *There is a beautiful Picture in the Royal Academy founded upon this Poem.—The Verses within inverted Commas are those which are embodied in the Picture. According to the catalogue of the 1812 Exhibition of the Royal Academy , George Dawe, Academician, of 22, Newman street, exhibited a "Portrait of S. T. Coleridge, Esq." among the Drawings, a "Bust of S. T. Coleridge, Esq." in the Model Academy, and a painting in the Inner Room, Number 220: "Genevieve; from a poem by T. Coleridge [ sic ] entitled 'Love.'" In the catalogue lines 33-40 are quoted, with the Lyrical Ballads version of line 34, "The low, the deep." 1813 *Jan. 25. C . "Hear, sweet spirit!" Song of 14 lines (E. H. C., p. 849) in a review of Remorse informing us that the music for this lyric was "finely composed by Kelly" and "exquisitely sung by Mrs. Bland." 1818 *Jan. 30. C. Fancy in Nubibus; or, The Poet in the Clouds . Signed "S. T. C." This first publication was first noted by Thomas M. Raysor ( Coleridge's Shakespearean Criticism , II, 307). It varies from E. H. C. p. 435 only in mechanics. *Jan. 31. New Times. The Solitary Date Tree . "Imitation of one of the Minnesinger of the Thirteenth Century, introduced by Mr. Coleridge in his lecture on the literature of the Middle Ages." Noted by Thomas M. Raysor, loc. cit. , with mention of "variations from the later text." I have not collated . 1819 November. Blackwood's. Fancy in Nubibus . *Signed "S. T. Coleridge." Variants as noted in E. H. C., p. 435. It is curious that the collected version reverts to the 1818 C text (above). Walter Graham ( English Literary Periodicals , p. 289) notes that this poem also was printed as "for the first time" in Sharpe's London Magazine , 1829.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Financing the Publication of Early New England Sermons by Rollo G. Silver</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ESPECIALLY IN NEW ENGLAND, THE PRINTED SERMON of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries served other purposes aside from the theological. While it was primarily a lecture on moral conduct, it also marked important political occasions, memorialized the dead, and sometimes functioned as a newspaper in reporting and editorializing on current events. As Holmes points out, the first generation of Massachusetts preachers sermonized on church doctrine, polity, and homiletics, but in the second generation the preachers "began to point their morals and to illustrate their sermons with the news of temporal occurrences and events; and even to adopt the more impressive of occasional events as topics for their sermons." 1 Thus our early sermons added the spice of immediate excitement such as hangings, earthquakes, ship explosions, and elections to their routine theological subject matter—what is Right or Wrong, Good or Bad, and the Ways of God to Man. Sales varied according to the interest a sermon aroused: Cotton Mather's sermon on the earthquake of 1727 achieved three editions and Thomas Prince's sermon on the same catastrophe had two editions; but a sermon on the death of a parishioner, or a homily on the public spirit that should be evoked on Election Day attracted few readers, too few, in fact, for publishing at a profit. When such sermons appeared—and they were numerous—their expenses were underwritten by a relative, friends, or a corporate body. Between the best sellers and the worst, there was yet another type that could be marketed with fair prospect of small gain to the publisher who, at times, was the author himself. Here in our early history is a microcosm of present-day publishing— ranging from pre-established successes to what we now call vanity publishing. Although this may also be true for other classes of literature in Calvinist New England, nowhere except in the class of sermons is there so much evidence relating to the financing of publications. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to determine the financial sponsor by looking at the imprint. Books printed "for John Usher" were not always sponsored by him. 2 Nor were all books printed "upon Assignment of Samuel Sewall" printed at Sewall's expense. 3 Additional information lies in the diaries, memoirs, public documents, archives, and occasionally on the title-page of the publication itself. When Lindsay Swift prepared his comprehensive survey of Massachusetts Election Sermons, he turned to public documents and found, for example, that when Richard Mather delivered his Election Sermon in 1644, the General Court voted that "the printer shall have leave to print the election sermon, w th M r Mathers consent, &amp; the artillery sermon, w th M r Nortons consent." 4 Whether or not this permission implies a censorship is not germane; it is clear that the General Court did not plan to pay for printing the Election Sermon and, as a matter of fact, it probably never reached print. Five years later, Thomas Cobbett, who delivered the Election Sermon, was told by the Court that "it is their desire he would print it heere or elsuhere" (Swift, p. 395). As no copy has survived, it is presumed that this, too, did not find a printer. Not until the 1660's were Massachusetts Election Sermons printed, and then at private expense even though the preacher was requested to prepare a copy for the press. In 1668, this request was made of William Stoughton, but when the sermon was printed two years later, the Advertisement mentioned a "Person of Worth" who adventured the publishing (Swift, p. 399). The New Plymouth Colony, on the other hand, voted to print Thomas Walley's Election Sermon of 1669. 5 Still Massachusetts continued its policy of making no provision for printing or honorarium and it was not until the middle of the next decade that the policy of the General Court began to change. On May 27, 1674, it ordered "that the Reuerend M r . Samuel Torrey &amp; M r . Joshua Moody be thanked from this Court for the great &amp; very acceptable pajnes which they tooke in their late election sermons, and that they be desired to print their sajd sermons w th as much speed as may be . . . ." 6 A year later, on May 12, 1675, it declared that "In consideration of the Reuerend M r . Torrey his charge in printing his election sermon, the Court judgeth it meet to give him fiue pounds out of the publick tresury, to reimburse his charge therein" ( Ibid. , V, 32). Though a first step had at last been taken, the Court did not immediately decide to pay for the printing of future sermons so that Joshua Moody, who delivered the Election Sermon in 1675, was, as usual, requested "to transcribe a copy thereof meete for the presse, that it may be printed" (Swift, p. 402). In 1683, however, the General Court ordered payment to Samuel Sewall for Samuel Torrey's Election Sermon; 7 in the following year John Hale's Election Sermon was ordered printed "at the publick charge" (Swift, p. 405). The General Court continued this custom when it approved the sermon and in such instances the sermon was printed upon receipt of fair copy. Sometimes the size of edition varied according to the Court's opinion of the virtue of the discourse. In 1701, the Court ordered five hundred copies of Joseph Belcher's Election Sermon, but in the following year it ordered merely one hundred copies of Increase Mather's ( Holmes IM , I, 250, 254). Perhaps the best-known private organization which maintained the custom of Election Sermons is the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company. Although most of its early records were lost in the fire of 1761, two volumes still exist in Faneuil Hall. 8 Examinations of these records reveals that in 1737, if not before, the Company paid for the printing of its Election Sermon. Two years later, the Company not only voted to print the sermon of 1739, but also to present the Governor and every member of the General Assembly with a copy and to present every member of the Company with two copies. A similar measure was passed the following year. According to the records, many of the Election Sermons after 1741 were printed by subscription, but even in such instances the Company seems to have been financially responsible. On September 5, 1763, it voted that "the Clerk settle with Mess r . Edes &amp; Gill for the last Artillery Election Sermon which was preach'd by the Rev d . M r . Tho s . Balch &amp; pay them for the Remainder of the 300 sermons that were not subscribed for &amp; also that the Clerk sell them to any of the Company at eight pence each." While maintaining a subscription basis for many of its sermons, the Company seems to have varied the procedure when conditions warranted. In June, 1788, the Company voted to procure two hundred copies of David Osgood's Election Sermon; the following September, it voted that "each Member shall pay One Shilling and Six pence for two of Sermons preached by Rev d . D. Osgood at the Anniversary and Six pence apiece for as many more as they may see proper to take." In 1789, the Company evidently had greater confidence in the success of that year's sermon; it voted "to print the Rev d . M r . Barnard's Sermon by Subscription." If any generalization may be derived from these scattered data, it is that printing of Election Sermons with public or organizational funds was not a purely automatic process. It developed over a period of forty years and even when established depended upon approval of text, preparation of the manuscript, and financial resources. Since copies of the sermons were allotted rather than sold, circulation, if not reading, was assured. Another class of sermons, those discussing contemporary events or those on non-resistance to sin and the damnation that was inexorable could be profitably marketed by bookseller-publishers astute enough to assume the financing. When James Morgan was executed for murder in 1686, John Dunton, who had just arrived in Boston, was quick to seize the opportunity of publishing Increase Mather's sermon on the occasion. Issued in partnership with Joseph Brunning, the pamphlet went into a second edition the following year. The success of such ventures encouraged printers and publishers to engage in enterprises which were based upon enthusiasm rather than editorial skill—an occupational hazard of the publishing industry. Isaiah Thomas, writing about Timothy Green, said, "It has been said of him, that whenever he heard a sermon which he highly approved, he would solicit a copy from the author, and print it for his own sales. This honest zeal in the cause of religion often proved injurious to his interest. Large quantities of these sermons lay on hand as dead stock; and, after his decease, they were put into baskets, appraised by the bushel, and sold under the value of common waste paper." 9 It is probable that some members of the book trade placed shorthand writers in the audience when an unusually promising sermon was about to be delivered. Increase Mather, in The Righteous Man a Blessing (1702), wrote: "These Sermons were Preached at the Lecture in Boston . Having been informed that many who live in the Country, as well as in this Town, have desired they might be published, and one who took in Short hand what I delivered, having shewed me his transcribed Copy, I have perused it, and consented to its being sent to the Press" ( Holmes IM , I, 254). Certainly this smacks of a publisher's scheme. And Holmes suggests that it may have been Samuel Phillips, the publisher, who inspired a shorthand writer to take down a sermon delivered by Increase Mather in 1695 ( Holmes IM , II, 612). These examples show that the publishing of this class of sermons was lucrative enough to warrant aggressiveness in securing copy. But for memorial sermons honoring the lesser-known dead subsidizing was usually necessary. As early as 1660, according to Winship, the memory of a deceased pastor was honored by printing his last sermon or two. Winship also points out that "It was customary long afterward for such a publication to be seen to the press by a committee representing the parish, and for one member to dominate its action and often to pay the bill" (Winship, p. 261). The pastor's final sermon was not the only way of honoring his memory; instead, his funeral sermon at times served the purpose. In 1717, for instance, the people of Salem Village published Joseph Capen's funeral sermon on their deceased pastor, Joseph Green ( Holmes IM , II, 583). This custom of paying for the printing of a funeral sermon prevailed as well in the more prosperous families. A typical bill, written in 1748, still exists: The Estate of the Hon. Anthony Stoddard, Esq. Deceased, to Sam l . Kneeland, D r . To paper, printing &amp;c. of 300 of the Rev d . M r . Princes Sermon, on the Death of Madam Stoddard, his Consort, at 3 s per Book, old Tenor} £45 00 00 Errors Excepted, per Sam l . Kneeland 10 Throughout the eighteenth and into the nineteenth centuries, groups or individuals continued to pay for memorials. To honor people of exceptionally high civic status, the authorities not only paid the printing cost but also presented a copy to each family within the town; this was done with the funeral sermon for Nathaniel Gorham in 1786 11 However, the most extensive demonstration of this practice occurred after the death of George Washington when town after town acclaimed him. It is interesting to note that even more sermons should have been printed if there had not been such a surfeit of them. In Salem, for instance, William Bentley delivered the official oration on Washington which was to have been printed at the expense of the town. Bentley duly recorded this in his diary: "The Town at their adjournment have voted to raise in Salem 6000 D. to be appropriated in funeral &amp; other honours to Gen. Washington. Only 100 copies of the Sermon are to be printed at the expence of Salem &amp; of these, 10 copies are to be given to each of the 6 ministers &amp; the remaining 40 to be left with the keeper of the Social Library to be lent to such as cannot purchase." 12 Eight days later he wrote: "In proposing to print all the Sermons of Salem, the Town has tied a Stone to their Oration &amp; has sunk it forever" (Bentley, II, 328). His sermon did not reach a printer, but at least five others delivered in Salem did so. This is not surprising because the biographical and historical information they contained attracted many readers. The works of Cotton Mather, that passionate pamphleteer, afford the best conspectus of the many methods of financing sermon publication. Mather, of course, considered the printed sermon a most important part of his evangelical work. Mere publication did not satisfy him; he worked ardently to circulate his theories of the struggle between temptation and conscience. Referring to one of his sermons, he declared in his diary that "the Sermon will be an agreeable Engine for me to employ on many Occasions, when Books of Piety are to be dispensed." 13 On days of his pastoral visits, he usually gave away a half a dozen books ( CM Diary , I, 518); he also placed them on outgoing vessels ( CM Diary , II, 14). In 1705/6, he stated that he gave away at least six hundred books a year ( CM Diary , I, 548). For one book, Family Religion , Mather ordered a thousand copies. He tied them into bundles and "concerted with some of my Friends a way to convey a Bundle to every Town in all these Colonies, and unto some other Places." 14 To make certain of sufficient material always at hand, he employed a variety of devices to secure publication. References in Mather's diary imply that some of the more popular sermons were issued at the financial risk of the bookseller-publishers. When John Baily died in 1697, Mather preached on the day of the funeral: A Good Man Making A Good End . In his diary, Mather wrote: "The Publication of this Discourse was much Desired; so I gave it unto the Book-sellers" ( CM Diary , I, 245). Similar passages relate to other sermons of obvious popular appeal. In 1697/8, "some of my Neighbours, (and some, from whom I little expected any such Respect,) call for the Discourse, which I lately uttered, at Boston-Lecture , after that a great part of the Town, as well as myself, had recovered from our late Illness. Accordingly in Peece of a Day or two, I fitted the Discourse for the Press, and gave it unto the Bookseller" ( CM Diary , I, 254). And, later in 1698, "The Sermon, I gave to the Book-seller; and annexed thereunto, an History of Criminals executed in this Land, and effectually, an Account of their dying Speeches, and of my own Discourses with them in their last Hours; hoping to warn others against Vice, by an History thus accomodated unto the purpose" ( CM Diary , I, 279-280). The following year, when he delivered the Boston Lecture, he was pleased to note: "And, behold, as I come out of the Meeting-house, the Book-sellers come to mee, entreating that they may have a Copy of these two Sermons, when the next shall bee delivered, for to bee published unto the Countrey" ( CM Diary , I, 296-297). More examples could be cited, but the best demonstration of their financial success appears in an incident which occurred in 1717 when Mather published The Valley of Hinnom , delivered just before the execution of Jeremiah Fenwick who murdered his neighbor: "I gave to the Bookseller my Essay upon, The valley of Hinnom . I was desirous at the same time, to have had him taken another Discourse for the Cure of Ungoverned Anger . He declined it, and I was easy; my Discourse must ly by under a Sentence of Death; my Labour be buried. But in five Dayes time, the Bookseller sells off an Impression of near a thousand which he printed of the former Essay; and now he comes to me for the Latter" ( CM Diary , II, 462). The publisher's lukewarm manner was readily familiar to Mather, but true to the drive of his violent soul he sternly expended more vigorous effort to continue publishing his message. If circumstances allowed, Mather would plan to purchase a number of copies and probably informed the bookseller of his intention. Before Unum Necessarium appeared in 1693, he promised, himself at least, that "for the two Years, next ensuing, if I lived, I would of those Books , buy from the Book-seller , after the rate of two a Week" ( CM Diary , I, 156). When Cares About the Nurseries was finished in 1701/2, Mather "gave it unto the Bookseller; with Resolutions, that when it is published, I will take off two or three every Week" ( CM Diary , I, 421). Seven years later, when The Cure of Sorrow went to the publisher, Mather planned "immediately to purchase forty-shillings worth of them, (and afterwards, if I live, many more,) to be dispersed among the Afflicted" ( CM Diary , II, 21). In 1722, he supplied fifty shillings toward the publication of The Minister and wrote to Thomas Prince expressing the intention of sending copies to Connecticut and some of the more southern provinces as soon as he received his fifty shillings' worth ( CM Diary , II, 684-685). Occasionally Mather would even publish a volume at his own expense. After his son Increase was lost at sea, Mather wrote: "I took the Sermon I preached on that Occasion, adding to it another that is agreeable; and with a considerable Expence enabled the Bookseller to publish them" ( CM Diary , II, 776). But it must be noted that the book finally appeared in an expanded form: "While it was, in the Press (which also was in this Month) a strange Hand of Providence made such an Accession from others, to my own Disbursements, that I could add a third Sermon, to the Book, wherein I may yett more notably serve the Designs of Piety" ( CM Diary , II, 776-777). The resources used by Mather to publish his sermons extended far beyond his own limits; an impressive number were underwritten by individuals and groups. Since the list of these is greater than realized, examples are presented in Table I. Examining it, one can see the extreme diversity of sponsors as well as the varieties of sponsorship which range from contribution of paper to payment for the entire edition. Such aid did not always come unsolicited; extant documents prove that Mather at times aggressively promoted publication. Writing to John Winthrop after he spoke at the funeral of Winthrop's uncle, he asked for publication of the sermon: "I confess freely to you, That, contrary to my usual conduct on such Occasions, (which is, To stay till such a thing be Desired by others,) I have myself Desired, and I do again Request, the publication of it." 15 In 1712, he even prepared the draft of a letter which he asked Samuel Penhallow to write to Thomas Archer seeking "a generous Tender of three or four pounds" towards the printing of Pastoral Desires ( CM Diary , II, 170). After two friends had offered to pay part of the cost of The Minister , Mather wrote to Thomas Prince: "If now I can gett the Assistence of but 50s or 3 d subscribed, I can, I suppose gett thro' the rest of the Expence which the Desired Publication may call for. Wherefore, I will be so rude, as to leave it with you, to Consult with our dear Cooper and Foxcroft " ( CM Diary , II, 684). This rather particular investigation of one man's extraordinary efforts to publish his sermons may be atypical but it does confirm the diversity of financing utilized in publication. Whereas some sermons were completely financed by a publisher or sponsor, others would have never been issued were it not for the informal cooperation of individuals. Many sermons of this period carry phrases like "Published by request" on the title-pages. These words are no more meaningful than "by popular demand" today. Nevertheless, in many cases it is possible to ascertain that the audience actually did, for one reason or another, subsidize publication. As early as 1682, some members of the Second Church paid for Increase Mather's Practical Truths; 16 twenty-five years later, some hearers contributed towards the printing of his Meditations on Death ( Holmes IM , I, 329). As shown in Table I, Cotton Mather's parishioners were sometimes equally generous, but their generosity was not limited to their own preacher. When James Pierpont of New Haven occupied Cotton Mather's pulpit in 1711, some of the listeners published Pierpont's sermon ( Holmes CM , II, 835). To cite one more example, Increase Mather's preface to A Monitor for Delaying Sinners (1719) by Thomas Symmes states that "His Auditors were so affected with it, as to importune him to grant them a Copy of his Discourse in order to its [ sic ] Publication by the Press" ( Holmes IM , II, 443). During the eighteenth century, evidence of this kind occasionally appears on the title-page in phrases like "Published at the desire and expence of some of the hearers" or "Published at the desire and expence of said society." Churches, conventions, and societies often paid for the publication of sermons, particularly those for ordinations, anniversaries, and other commemorative events. Writing to Ezra Stiles about the sermon at a convention in 1767, John Devotion succintly described the procedure: "Our first Business was to thank him in Convention &amp; ask a Copy, and Money was subscribed and paid in Hand." 17 But, in addition to these official publications, the members of a church or society were willing to subscribe for particularly soul-stirring ones. Now and then, an individual paid the entire cost: Increase Mather's A Call to the Tempted was printed posthumously in 1723/4 at the expense of Samuel Sewall ( Holmes IM , I, 98); Nathaniel Appleton's Thanksgiving sermon on the repeal of the Stamp Act was published in 1766 "by the desire of the audience, and at the expence of the honorable Brigadier General Brattle;" 18 Cotton Mather's The Everlasting Gospel was reprinted in Philadelphia in 1767 because Mrs. Elizabeth Hobbs "in her last Will order'd, that a Number of them should be printed and dispersed, according to Directions therein given, gratis " ( Holmes CM , I, 342). While discussing sermons as staple issues of the colonial press, Wroth mentions that "the printing of sermons as a private enterprise by the preachers themselves assumed in New England the proportions of a trade." 19 The minister, establishing the probable sale by circulation of subscription papers, negotiated with the printers for terms of mutual benefit. If the minister happened to reside at a distance from the printer, a colleague might negotiate for him. Charles Chauncy did this for Ezra Stiles in 1761. Writing to Stiles from Boston, Chauncy reported: "I have put your Sermon [ A Discourse on the Christian Union ] into the hands of Edes and Gill. They have engaged to deliver to you 300 copies well printed upon good paper for 75 Dollars. Draper would not do it under 80." 20 Chauncy, by the way, ordered an extra two hundred copies for distribution in Connecticut. When Stiles visited Boston five years later, Edes &amp; Gill told him that "they printed between Seven &amp; Eight Hundred Copies of my Sermon, sold them &amp; had none left—&amp; said they made more by it than was ever made in Boston by one Sermon, and would readily now print a new Edition if any body would engage 200 Copies." 21 David McClure, in 1779, performed a similar service for Jeremy Belknap: I am desired to inform [you] that the preparations for printing your sermon are in forwardness. M r Fowle has undertaken to print it in Portsm o . There are about one hundred subscribed for in this place. Subscriptions must circulate in neighbouring towns. Setting the press for 100 will turn out 6/ per p t exclusive of paper; 200, 4/; 300, 3/; what the expense of paper will be I have not heard. You will please to forward the copy to the printer as soon as convenient. They determine to go thro' with it should no more subscribers offer. 22 Belknap conducted such transactions in a businesslike manner. Writing to Ebenezer Hazard in Philadelphia on October 27, 1792, he discussed plans for his discourse on the discovery of America: You there advised me to print "a large edition" of my Century Sermon, a subscription for which is now filling very fast in this town. I had thoughts of printing about 1,100, but have been persuaded to increase it to 1,500. Brother Morse, who you know is very sanguine, says 2 or 3,000; but I am not so much of an adventurer as he is. However, I suppose 1,500 will be the number, and that they will be finished in about three weeks. I shall send some to you, for Dobson to sell. It is possible , I say possible , that more may be wanted in Philadelphia than I shall send; and, if so, perhaps it may not be improper for you to suggest to Dobson that he might venture an edition there, with my permission. Should this idea be acceptable, I now give you full power to agree with him on terms, as my attorney or agent, only with this exception, that I do not wish to take my share in books or sheets, because I can have enough more printed here, if they are wanted. 23 When the Society for Propagating the Gospel Among the Indians reprinted sermons by Belknap and Thomas Tayler, it was Belknap who arranged matters with the printer. Fortunately, the manuscript of the contract has been preserved: Memorandum—I the subscriber promise to M r Jeremy Belknap that I will print five hundred Copies of his Sermon on 1 Corinthians 3.11. on Crown paper &amp; with a Pica type &amp; will deliver them to his order stitched in blue paper covers at three pence three farthings each Copy, provided the said Sermon can be comprehended in two sheets—&amp; at four pence each Copy provided it do not exceed two sheets &amp; a quarter. I also promise to print a Sermon on Mark 2.27 by T Tayler with the addition of two prayers for the Lords day by M r Henry—in the same manner &amp; on the same Terms.— I further promise that I will print any additional Number of each of the said Sermons on paper delivered to me by said Belknap, for eight shillings for every hundred copies to be delivered in sheets, and that I will print no more copies of the said first mentioned Sermon than those which are contracted for by said Belknap &amp; delivered to his order. Sam 1 . Hall Boston June 1. 1792. 24 If more contracts had survived, it might have been possible to determine the material rewards which accrued to the authors of these pamphlets. Though the publication of sermons was, at times, a trade, the process was probably not very lucrative for the American preacher of the eighteenth century. As late as 1791, William Bentley was surprised to learn that fifteen hundred copies of John Murray's sermon on Blind Prince were engaged—"our best sermons commonly rise no higher than 400 at an impression" (Bentley, I, 251). This, of course, is a number much too small to yield much money. As for official or organizational sermons, author's copies might or might not be provided. Daniel Henchman, calculating his costs for printing the Artillery Company Election Sermons in 1735 and 1736, set aside fifty copies of each for the author; 25 the very incomplete records of the Company indicate that each of the preachers for 1737 and 1790 also received fifty copies. It is probable that the custom prevailed in other years, too. The figure of fifty appears to be standard throughout the eighteenth century for organizations which conducted their work with proper care. In 1787, Ezra Stiles recorded a gift of fifty copies of his ordination sermon for Henry Channing, 26 and three years later William Bentley (I, 205) noted that he had received fifty copies of his sermon preached at the Stone Chapel in Boston. The attitude of other people, however, was sometimes rather cavalier. Belknap told Hazard his difficulty in obtaining copies of his New Hampshire Election Sermon for 1785: "I know not by what policy my quota of copies was detained from me; but, after trying several ways to get them, in vain, I at length made use of a person whom I knew to be indefatigable in the pursuit of any and every thing he undertakes; and, by his means, I got 20 copies". 27 And, under entry for January 28, 1797, William Bentley's diary (II, 212) emphasizes a similar disappointment: "Received thus late a few copies of my Discourse at Roxbury." Mindful of the time spent in preparing the sermons, of the time spent in travel to deliver them and then to return home, of the rudenesses accepted with dignity, one cannot help but have increased admiration for these sturdy and pious men. By these economics, the New England colonist was supplied with much of his reading matter. Perhaps the most striking conclusion to be drawn from an investigation such as this is that, with one qualification, the procedures for financing the publication of sermons in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries survive in America today. In the last century, Edward Everett Hale conducted his own publishing firm for the sale of his sermons, 28 but, of course, few ministers publish their own sermons today. However, the parallel still holds, for memorial volumes are still issued by the family of the departed, churches still print their important sermons, and publishers still seek the manuscripts of popular preachers like Harry Emerson Fosdick and Norman Vincent Peale.

      <field name="heading_text">Benjamin Franklin's Philadelphia Type by C. William Miller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SOME SEVENTY-TWO YEARS AGO C. R. HILDEBURN, at work on his compilation of Colonial Pennsylvania imprints, saw clearly that if a scholar were to identify the mass of unsigned presswork issuing from the shop of Benjamin Franklin, he must first study the distinctive type which Franklin and his fellow craftsmen used. The state of printing in the Middle Colonies made the conditions for such a study unusually favorable. In the early and middle decades of the eighteenth century there were seldom more than a half-dozen important printers at work in this whole cluster of Middle Provinces. The individual printer's array of type sizes was limited, his fonts usually quite different from those of his competitors, and his use of the same letter consistent over long years because type then was particularly hard to come by and costly and difficult to replace. Studying Franklin bibliography was not, however, Hildeburn's prime concern; he was engaged in a pioneering venture of far wider scope and in the end attempted to identify all the unsigned Pennsylvania presswork from that of William Bradford's lone press in 1685 to that issued by the numerous printers of the Post-Revolutionary Era. 1 His contribution to Franklin studies was nevertheless the first major one, and both Charles Evans in the first four volumes of his American Bibliography (1903-04) and W. J. Campbell in his Short-title Checklist of Franklin Imprints (1918) have accepted as authoritative Hildeburn's ascriptions of unsigned items to Franklin. In a project so ambitious as that undertaken by Hildeburn, inaccuracies are almost inevitable, and recent research has shown them to be serious enough in Franklin bibliography alone to force a restudy of that material. Hildeburn, understandably, missed both signed and unsigned Franklin printing which has since come to light, but in addition he mistook Baskerville type for Caslon and hence ascribed to Franklin's press work which must have been done at least fifty years later. He identified type as Franklin's, which was not in his shop or in that of his competitors. He assumed that Franklin had a monopoly on government printing in the Province and ignored type evidence which indicated otherwise, and left unnoted printing done by Franklin but signed by fellow craftsmen. In short, Hildeburn did not pursue his type studies systematically or apply consistently his knowledge. And in his work on Sewel's History of the Quakers (1728) he failed to perceive that his type knowledge was the only tool by which he could solve his bibliographical problem. 2 Hildeburn's most significant contribution to Franklin then, perhaps, is his demonstrating the fruitfulness of his approach through a knowledge of type, and for the student intent on studying anew the whole of Franklin's printing and publishing activities, as I am, the goal is clearly to move in the direction which Hildeburn has indicated and hope to avoid his errors. The type which Franklin owned falls into three divisions: (1) the variety of letter which he used at the Passy press during his sojourn in France from 1776 to 1785 and later brought back to America and sold in part to the New York printer Francis Childs; (2) the arrays of fonts with which Franklin stocked the houses of his numerous printing partners at work in colonies other than Pennsylvania, within the Province of Pennsylvania but not in Philadelphia, or within Philadelphia but printing in German rather than English; and (3) the large body of type which Franklin used in his original printing house established in Philadelphia in the spring of 1728 and relinquished in January of 1766 to David Hall, the reliable Scotsman whom he had taken into partnership eighteen years before in 1748. This present paper deals exclusively with the type last mentioned — that with which Franklin started his career and that used later in the same shop by Franklin and Hall trading as partners. The objectives of the study are principally historical and descriptive. Mr. Lawrence C. Wroth has succeeded admirably in indicating generally where the colonial American printer acquired his type, how much he bought, what sometimes it cost, and how he used it. 3 This paper will offer the fuller information on these points to be gleaned from an intensive study of a single eminent and very enterprising colonial printer like Franklin. The other objective, and as an aid in future research far the more important, is the identification and cataloguing of all of Franklin's type, establishing approximate terminal dates for the use of various fonts and finally supplying plates of each of Franklin's text types together with selected examples of the differing faces used in the shops of his competitors. The resources for carrying on this Franklin investigation, despite my evident inability to find conclusive answers for all the important questions, are extraordinary — richer certainly than those for any other colonial American printer practising his craft in the middle decades of the eighteenth century — and perhaps because of their odd variety merit a comment at the outset. The single most important material is, of course, the large amount of extant printed matter issuing from Franklin's shop: the weekly issues of his newspaper, The Pennsylvania Gazette , and the more than 500 preserved Franklin imprints. Next in significance are the revealing observations in the Autobiography and scattered comments among the thousands of published Franklin letters, especially those in the Strahan-Hall-Franklin correspondences. The important new material, much of it previously unstudied, is the David Hall manuscripts — a series of letter books covering the entire period of the Franklin-Hall partnership, business papers of Hall and of Franklin and Hall recently rediscovered, and a few important new Franklin-Hall letters not known before to exist. Related to these, and ideally suited for this study are the papers of James Parker, Franklin's former printing partner in New York City, commissioned as the agent of Franklin during his stay in London, to reach an equitable settlement with Hall upon termination of the Franklin-Hall partnership. The key document is an itemized list of the firm's complete type holdings in January of 1766, by size, weight, state of wear, and estimated monetary value.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the fall of 1724 Franklin took ship for London where he would be "on the Spot . . . to chuse the Types &amp; see that everything was good of the kind" 4 for the little printing house which Governor Keith of Pennsylvania had urged him to set up in Philadelphia and declared himself willing to underwrite. Within days after his arrival Franklin came to understand the nature of the governor's promises, that they were well intentioned but hollow, and to perceive that he was not to have a shop of his own as he had imagined. Further, except out of curiosity he was now under no compulsion to search among the English foundries for the type faces which most pleased him. Franklin's stay in London, according to the Autobiography , lasted about eighteenth months, from December 24, 1724, to July 23, 1726. Almost immediately upon arrival he secured employment at the large printing house of Samuel Palmer in Bartholomew Close, first as a pressman, and later as a compositor. After staying there about a year, he joined the even larger house of John Watts near Lincoln Inn Fields, where he continued working until his return to America. The associations with both great printing establishments, one may infer, left their considerable mark on Franklin and contributed much to a developing interest in type founding and design. Located near Palmer's in Bartholomew Close was the type foundry of Thomas James, at that time the most important firm of its kind in England. Franklin states that he "had seen type cast at James's in London" ( Memoris , p. 136) and observed the craft sufficiently to be able later while working for Keimer to contrive moulds, crude makeshift puncheons, and matrices suitable to supply Keimer's wanted sorts. At both Palmer's and Watts' Franklin would also have heard of William Caslon, whose new type faces were in time to make obsolete the James' large stock of earlier English and Dutch fonts. Palmer and Watts each had recognized Caslon's genius, and commended him on his early letter cutting, and encouraged him to consider type-founding as a career, Palmer repudiating his stand later when some of his business associates made clear to him that Caslon's success as a founder might ruin their trade. 5 Hence, a dozen years before Franklin was to buy his first Caslon fonts, he must have had pointed out to him, or have seen for himself, the remarkable promise of this new letter designer. Franklin left London late in the summer of 1726 thinking that he was done with the craft of printing forever; he had accepted the offer of a clerkship in the Philadelphia store of Mr. Denham, a Quaker merchant, and entertained high prospects of eventually establishing a business of his own in the West Indies. The death of Denham in the spring of 1727 having dissipated Franklin's hopes, he returned reluctantly to the employ of the printer Samuel Keimer as the foreman of his shop. There he met Hugh Meredith, earned the esteem of Hugh's father, and having been offered financial backing by the elder Meredith agreed to set up a printing house in partnership with the son in the spring of 1728. Franklin drew up a list of needed equipment amounting to £200 in currency and gave it to Mr. Meredith, who in turn carried the order to a merchant ( Memoirs , pp. 126, 132, 140, 164). This inventory for the new shop was sent probably with Captain Annis, clearing Philadelphia customs on October 19, 1727, and docking in London about the first week of December; the new partners' hope obviously was for delivery on an early sailing in the spring. Here then is Franklin's first order of type. He has left us no other record of the transaction or hints about the assortment of fonts requested — only the task of trying to reconstruct the inventory and find answers to a series of questions. An analysis of the type used in his early imprints makes clear that he had commissioned quantities of but six fonts. Three he planned to use regularly as text letter: the English, pica, and long primer; two others — the double pica and the French canon — for both limited text-letter and titling; one, the two line pica, exclusively for titling. 6 In addition he included the usual supply of quotations and a generous quantity of flowers to match the three sizes of his text type; these he used to contrive an ingenious array of factotums and page decorations, a marked feature of his typography throughout his printing career. Foreseeing the likelihood of printing almanacs years before he conceived the idea of writing and publishing his own Poor Richards , he ordered an extra quantity of long primer figures and the necessary planet sorts. In what amounts and at what cost he purchased this type one can make only a close guess. Twenty-five years later, on October 27, 1753, Franklin wrote Strahan in London asking him to order from Caslon a quantity of type for "a small printing office . . . at New Haven," to be shipped by the first boat in the spring. 7 The itemized list except for the 100 lbs. of great primer and the 50 lbs. of two line English parallels so nearly the inventory of fonts found in Franklin's early printing that I offer it as a probable duplication of his first order. 300 lbs. long primer, with figures and signs sufficient for an almanac 300 lbs. pica 100 lbs. great primer 300 lbs. English 30 lbs. two line capitals and ffowers for different fonts 20 lbs. quotations 60 lbs. double pica 50 lbs. two line English 40 lbs. two line great primer 8 Without the great primer and the two line English the order in aggregate weighs 1050 lbs., about one-fourth the weight of the type owned by the firm of Franklin and Hall in 1766. 9 This 1050 lbs. of type purchased in 1728 would have cost Franklin and Meredith at least one-half of their available £200 in currency (Wroth, op. cit. , pp. 65-68). In this 1753 order one has no difficulty in identifying Caslon as the founder responsible for casting the fonts; with Franklin's initial order, on the other hand, one wonders whether or not he designated founder and face, particularly for the distinctive pica and English fonts which are identical except in size. Franklin's recent sojourn in London would have afforded him opportunity to decide upon the text letter he preferred, but his disillusioning experience with Governor Keith and his departure from London thinking that he was done with the printing craft forever might well have made such a hypothetical selection seem pointless. His pica and English fonts are slightly larger than those of his competitors Andrew Bradford and Samuel Keimer, and, I think, considerably more pleasing to the eye; this impression of greater attractiveness results in part, however, from Franklin's superior presswork and consistently cleaner case. On one occasion, at least ( Memoirs , p. 160), Franklin stated that the type which he used in The Pennsylvania Gazette was "better" than that which Keimer had employed earlier in the same publication. Quite possibly Franklin made the claim because he had personally selected the fonts or relied on a knowing craftsman in London to select them for him and knew them to be superior to Keimer's; on the other hand, he may simply have been fortunate in the fonts which the Philadelphia merchant had secured for him. The fact that Franklin reordered quantities of the identical six fonts in 1731 in order to stock the printing house of his partner Thomas Whitmarsh located in Charleston, South Carolina, suggests certainly that Franklin had a marked preference for the type he was then using in his own shop. In 1728 there were in England at most five foundries from which Franklin might have ordered his letter: in Oxford, the Andrews foundry, and in London, the foundries of Grover, Mitchell, James, and an anonymous founder for whom there exist no specific dates of operation. 10 The only recorded extant specimen book for any of these is that one published together with the sale catalogue of the James punches and matrices in 1782. 11 The specimen book includes only a sampling of the extensive holdings of the James foundry, particularly of the romans and italics, and the history of its compilation is a tangled one. "The greatest part" of it was done, however, in 1736, 12 three years after Thomas James had bought up the matrices of the Andrew foundry and years before John James, his son and successor, had acquired a portion of the Mitchell foundry and the whole of those belonging to the Grover foundry, which had ceased operating with the death of its owner early in 1728. 13 The fonts represented in the specimen book must therefore have been cast largely from matrices owned in 1728, the year in which Franklin ordered his letter, by either Andrews or James, and the greater portion of these, presumably, was owned originally by James. Of the type included in this specimen book one font is identical with Franklin's, the French canon no. 3, both roman and italic, labeled further as Berthelet 2, matrices 85, and Berthelet 3, matrices 69 respectively. 14 Since Franklin was acquainted with the James foundry and since either Franklin or the Philadelphia merchant ordering the type would probably have found it more convenient to deal with a London rather than an Oxford foundry, this French canon titling type and the other five fonts listed in Franklin's 1728 inventory were in all likelihood castings from matrices owned by the James foundry. These fonts acquired in 1728 at the outset of his career Franklin used steadily for the next ten years. He did, however, secure in the fall of 1734 15 a small quantity of black letter long primer which he employed sporadically until 1742. For Franklin the new font served two special uses: one was to mark the holy days in the text of his Poor Richards ; the other was to set the Gazette advertisements written in the German language, since Franklin never used in his own shop or in that of Franklin and Hall any German scriptorial letter. Black letter was by no means a novel type in Philadelphia printing. Andrew Bradford had small quantities of two black letter sizes — a two line English and a long primer — from the start of his career in 1713, and he and William Bradford, Jr., his nephew after him used the identical font of long primer for advertisements in German in their newspapers. Franklin's original font, readily distinguishable from that of the Bradfords, bears a family resemblance to the type cut by Christoffel van Dijck and exhibited in the 1681 specimen of the elder Daniel Elzevir. 16 The Bradfords', on the other hand, resembles more closely the black letter English and pica of Oxford University cast from matrices presented by Dr. Fell. 17 Fonts derived from both families of black letter appear among the samples in the James specimen of 1782, but only in sizes larger than the long primer. 18 By 1738 Franklin's printing business had increased enormously. He launched his newspaper in October of 1729. As early as 1730 he had won from Bradford the position of official printer for the Pennsylvania General Assembly. In the late fall of 1732 he began publishing the first of his Poor Richard Almanacks , which soon became so popular that he was eventually printing annual editions of nearly 10,000 copies. By 1734 he was serving as public printer for both New Jersey and Delaware, the second known before 1776 as the counties of New-castle, Kent, and Sussex. His election as Clerk of the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1736 put him in a position to obtain commissions for even more government printing than he had enjoyed before. This increased volume obliged him to consider some long range plans for acquiring additional fonts and for replacing his present text letter which after ten years had become somewhat rubbed. The earliest in a series of purchases of new fonts of text letter appear together in the Gazette on May 4, 1738. The issue is a memorable one, for it marks Franklin's first use of Caslon type, and possibly the earliest use of Caslon in Colonial American printing. His first two new fonts were pica and small pica, the second remarkable for its acute shortage of p and u sorts which obliged Franklin's compositors to substitute inverted d's and n's consistently until February of 1739. From this point in Franklin's career, the spring of 1738, until the termination of his partnership with Hall on January 21, 1766, Franklin, with one exception purchased Caslon text type exclusively for use in his Philadelphia house. The single exception, an obviously non-Caslon font of bourgeois with swash italic capital A's and N's and a gawky oversized roman capital W, makes only two appearances in Franklin's recorded printing: one, the slight Catalogue of Choice and Valuable Books offered for sale in the spring of 1744, and, two, portions of the text of Nos. 922-926 of the Gazette , running from August 14, to September 11, 1746. How this font came into his hands and when finally he disposed of it are at present unknown. There is no proof in Hall's printing that the font was among Franklin's letter when he turned over his shop to his partner in 1748. Franklin's first font of Caslon long primer came into use in the Gazette on May 3, 1739, the issue of the previous week, April 26, 1739, revealing his earliest display of Caslon flowers. By July 17, 1740, he had acquired his first Caslon brevier, and probably his first Caslon English, although it makes no appearance in the Gazette until September 18, 1740. At this time, or within a year, Franklin added fonts of Caslon great primer and paragon, a smaller quantity of Caslon double pica, and an assortment of Caslon titling letter — two line long primer, two line pica, and French canon. His two line double pica and five line pica, acquired about the same time, are for some unexplainable reason non-Caslon. Apparently the final purchase in this series was a small quantity of Caslon black letter brevier used first in the Gazette on September 2, 1742. Parker, in compiling his inventory of the type owned by the partners in 1766, fixed the weight of all the black letter — both long primer and brevier — together with "figures, planets, space rules" at a mere 53 lbs. (J. C. Oswald, loc. cit. ). This extensive purchase of Caslon type over a four-year period, 1738-1742, was the last Franklin was to make for his own shop before turning it over to his partner, David Hall, in January of 1748. The documents covering these transactions with Caslon, like those for Franklin's dealings earlier with the James foundry, are missing. The reconstruction is based, therefore, entirely on the evidence of the appearance of the type in Franklin's signed printing, particularly in the dated weekly issues of the Gazette , which for each new font from brevier to English furnished the basis for assigning the approximate time of purchase and earliest occurrence in Franklin's presswork. Without the records dealing with these type purchases it is impossible to determine how much Franklin paid for his new fonts, how exacting he was in designating a particular letter when Caslon offered for sale a choice of fonts within a given size, and whether or not Franklin dealt directly with the Caslon foundry. If one may form an opinion based on Franklin's later purchases, the likelihood is that Franklin dealt indirectly with the Caslon foundry and merely designated the size of type which he desired to buy. Certainly after 1743, the year in which Franklin initiated his correspondence with Strahan, it is clear that while Franklin dwelt in America he ordered his additional Caslon fonts through Strahan and relied on his judgment in selecting the most suitable letter. 19 Parker's itemized inventory of the type owned by Franklin and Hall in 1766 does make it possible, however, to state with some certainty in what quantity Franklin purchased several of these first Caslon fonts. Parker lists the following: 436 lbs. Long Primer, well worn 318 lbs. Small Pica, almost worn out 421 lbs. Pica, Old, and much batter'd 334 lbs. Old English, fit for little more than old metal 223 lbs. Great Primer, well worn 158 lbs. Double Pica, pretty good 91 lbs. Double English Do. 20 All of these, which represent but a portion of Parker's total inventory, I have associated with Franklin's original purchase of Caslon type only because I have found no clear evidence either in the printed matter or in the extant manuscripts to indicate that Franklin bought later additional quantities of these fonts. The one exception is a later font of Caslon English, but Parker clearly distinguishes it from the older one: "502 lbs. Newer English, nearly half worn" (J. C. Oswald, loc. cit. ). This newer Caslon English, acquired in order that Hall might undertake a large piece of government printing in folio, had appeared first in the printing of the laws of the General Assembly for April 5, 1756, while the older Caslon English seems last to have been employed in the printing of the laws for February 3, 1756. Parker's noting the existence of the two English fonts in 1766 makes clear that though Hall had acquired a fresh font of English some ten years before, he had not seen fit to scrap his worn one. Thus it is possible to explain how Franklin and Hall kept possession of their original font of Caslon English for a period of twenty-six years. They used it for sixteen years, and once it had worn out, merely kept it in storage for the next ten. But what of the other original Caslon fonts which they retained for an equally long period and kept in use? Part of the explanation certainly is that Franklin and Hall were loath to lay out any more money on type than they needed to. They expected their business to yield a substantial income, and to achieve this objective in troubled times with an unstable economy was no simple task. Moreover, Hall was a frugal man who tended to make do with what materials he possessed so long as they were tolerable. But a more important part of the explanation is the kind of printing they were engaged in and the demands that that printing made on their various sizes of type. From 1728 to 1738 Franklin regularly used English, pica, and long primer in his newspaper, long primer in the almanacs, and long primer and pica predominantly in the books he printed. Thereafter he began to use smaller and smaller fonts in the Gazette . The English disappeared, then the pica, and finally much of the small pica. After 1739 he fixed upon long primer and brevier, then all brevier, and eventually, brevier and bourgeois, but neither Franklin nor Hall was happy over their purchase of the bourgeois and wished they had bought brevier instead. The almanacs continued to be set in long primer, but this printing involved long years of standing type which made comparatively small additional demands on their font of long primer. As early as 1729 Franklin had begun printing annually in folio the laws of the Province and the votes and proceedings of the General Assembly; the large collected editions of these laws of Pennsylvania and those of the neighboring provinces followed in the forties and fifties. The font which Franklin and Hall used for their text letter was English and the section headings they set in the larger great primer, double pica, and double English. For the more sporadic portion of their printing — the pamphlets and books published in small editions — Franklin and Hall used their small pica and pica, or English. Hence the fonts which they worked hardest and needed most often to replace were the brevier and the English. The other fonts, the long primer, small pica, pica, great primer, double pica, and double English, they used more sparingly, and therefore understandably it was these sizes of the original Caslon purchase that remained tolerably serviceable from the time of their acquisition in 1738-1742 to the termination of the partnership early in 1766. When Franklin turned over his shop on January 21, 1748, to his new partner, he put into Hall's hands a stock of all-Caslon text type from eight to ten years old. The purchasing of any additional fonts was to be Franklin's responsibility, 21 though by stipulation in the articles of agreement the two men were to share jointly in the expense. 22 The font first in need of replacement was, quite predictably, the brevier, which with ten years of hard wear in the Gazette had become markedly worn; it lingered in the standing type of a few advertisements until December 19, 1752, more than two years after the new Caslon brevier had been pressed into service on September 27, 1750. 23 Franklin placed the order for this new type through Strahan just as he was to do with that for the new Caslon English mentioned earlier, which was commissioned in the summer and again in the fall of 1755 (HLB I, August 28, 1755) and first used in the spring of 1756 for printing one group of the laws. Also in the fall of 1755 both Franklin 24 and Hall were in correspondence with Strahan about a new small-body font. Hall wanted "500 weight" of a font, "Body of Brevier with long primer face &amp; if not with a Long primer Face, with one betwixt a long primer and Brevier" (HLB I, August 28, 1755). Caslon having cast the letter during the winter, Strahan in early March shipped "The Fount of Brevier . . . on Board Captain Reeve, who was ready to sail when an Embargo was clapt on all our Shipping for Six Weeks" (HLB I, March 13, 1756). The type arrived finally in time to be used in the Gazette on June 24, 1756. Franklin writing to Strahan from New York on July 2, remarked that "the brevier fount . . . came to hand in good order and pleases Mr. Hall and me very much." 25 In a reply to Hall written in September Strahan noted that "the new Letter in your Newspaper . . . looks very well" (HLB I, September 11, 1756). Then the storm broke. Hall discovered that he had received not a large face-small body font, but all bourgeois, and shortly thereafter Franklin discovered further that Caslon had billed him for a font of brevier at 2/6 per pound rather than for a font of bourgeois, which should have cost a half shilling less. Franklin felt put upon. He had paid £58/17/6 for the font, had been overcharged £11/15/6, and immediately wrote Strahan somewhat sharply requesting that he see Caslon about a refund, which we may infer was forthcoming since Franklin made no later reference to the matter. 26 An analysis of the bill reveals, incidentally, that the precise weight of the letter was 471 lbs. When Hall next had occasion to ask his partner to buy some new letter, Franklin was residing in London, having arrived there in July of 1757. When Hall's request reached him in the spring of 1758, he went directly to the foundry to place the order. Caslon cast the font — 192 lbs. of bourgeois — over the summer, and Franklin arranged for it to be shipped in September. The shipping was delayed, however, so that the type did not reach Philadelphia until the following spring. 27 What Hall wanted was not bourgeois but brevier. "The old Letter is shockingly bad," he wrote Franklin on March 5, 1760, "and I don't care to use the Bourgois [in the Gazette advertisement], for the Reason I have several times given you, that it drives out so much . . . ." 28 Franklin, having apparently realized his mistake some weeks earlier, had ordered Caslon to cast 300 lbs. of brevier at once. The font reached Hall on June 5, 1760 (HLB II, July 2, 1760), and first appeared in the Gazette on June 19. The precise composition of this font, the last which Franklin was to purchase for the firm of Franklin and Hall, he described to Hall in a letter dated March 28, 1760: "I order'd the Fount all Roman, as it will hold out better in the same Quantity of Work, having but half the Chance of Wanting Sorts, that the same Weight of Rom. &amp; Ital. would have, and the old Italic is not so much worn as the Roman, and so may serve a little longer." 29 The best that Hall could reply was, "The Brevier . . . looks very well, but sticks when distributed most intolerably (HLB II, July 2, 1760); and six months later, "The Brevier seems pretty perfect, only the lower Case s's run short . . . ." (HLB II, February 9, 1761). Thus the problem of insufficient sorts continued to plague Franklin. It had caused him to try his hand at casting type while he still worked for Keimer; it reduced him to an unhappy expedient in working with his new Caslon small pica in 1738; it caused Hall through the years to write Strahan repeatedly for small quantities of individual letters, 30 and Franklin was yet to face in the closing years and even final months of his life the wrangling correspondence with Francis Childs over the short sorts in the old Passy fonts. 31 By July of 1761, a little more than a year after Franklin had sent over the last font of Caslon brevier, Hall was urging him to order a like quantity of the same letter to be shipped at once. The Gazette advertisements were becoming so bulky that he was obliged "to distribute the standing ones in order to set up the new" (HLB II, July 20, 1761). Franklin allowed the request to go unheeded so involved had he become by this time in the responsibilities of his work as provincial agent. Eventually Hall understood that Franklin could no longer be expected to perform even these occasional chores for the firm, and on November 21, 1764, Hall asked Strahan to secure for him 500 lbs. of Caslon brevier, despite the fact that at that moment Franklin was again on the high seas bound for London, after returning to America in the fall of 1762. Hall explained further: "Mr. Franklin used to send for the Printing Letter, but as his Time and mine will, in all probability be out before I have the Pleasure of seeing him again what comes now will be in my Name . . . ." (HLB II, November 21, 1764). When the partnership terminated in January of 1766, Hall took over the shop and shortly thereafter joined in a new business agreement with a former employee, William Sellers. Their type save for the newly acquired font of brevier consisted of the stock previously owned by Franklin and Hall. In quantity and variation of size the letter was extensive, but as Parker explained to Franklin, ". . . indeed the whole is worn much, except the Double Pica and newest English, tho' neither of them are new." 32 Within six months Hall had begun ordering replacements for the old fonts, starting with the long primer and titling type (HLB III, June 7, 1766). Only one of Franklin's 1728 type acquisitions, the James' French canon, remained in use throughout the 38 years of Franklin's association with the Philadelphia printing house, and passed into the possession of Hall and Sellers. I found it used only once, and this in a line of long standing type. Within the year it had disappeared. This then is the history of the fonts of type which Franklin employed in his Philadelphia shop from 1728 to 1766, and the necessary preliminary to the consideration of one final question: With what certainty is it now possible to identify as Franklin's a piece of printing, unsigned or issued as the work of another, which falls within the 38 years of his active printing career and which is by some fashion connected with Pennsylvania, New Jersey, or Delaware? The answer is best divided into two parts. During the greater portion of Franklin's career as the master of his own shop, from the spring of 1728 to the late summer of 1743, I believe it possible to identify positively on the evidence of the type just about any piece of unsigned Franklin printing. In 1728 Franklin had but two competitors in Philadelphia. The less significant was his old employer, Samuel Keimer, whose meager holdings of text type consisted of two fonts of English and one each of pica and long primer, all of them readily distinguishable from Franklin's. Keimer sold his shop to David Harry in 1729 and went to Barbados where Harry joined him in 1730, "taking the printing house with him" ( Memoirs , p. 174). Franklin's more formidable competitor was, of course, Andrew Bradford, whose type holdings exceeded Franklin's but differed from them in every font. One, therefore, can distinguish Franklin's printing from that of Andrew Bradford during the years 1728-1742, and from that of Cornelia Bradford, his widow, who directed the business actively until 1746. Christopher Sauer set up his press in Germantown in 1738, but his type also differed from Franklin's as did the fonts of both Peter Zenger and William Bradford, Sr. in New York. There were no printers in New Jersey or Delaware. The second part of the answer involves complications. It covers the period of 1743 to 1766, the last few years of Franklin's sole proprietorship and the whole of his partnership with Hall. In 1742 Franklin completed his series of purchases of all-Caslon fonts; by 1743 he had disposed of the last of his original James letter except for the seldom seen French canon, which persisted until 1766. It is this array of new Caslon letter acquired by Franklin that at one and the same time presents the surest basis for identifying his later unsigned presswork, and the gravest obstacle. The chief complicating factor is Andrew Bradford's nephew, William Bradford, Jr., who opened his Philadelphia shop about July 1, 1742, and had acquired by early September 1743, a font of Caslon English, by December 1745, a font of Caslon pica, and by December 1746, a font of Caslon long primer. He did possess from the outset, however, non-Caslon fonts of English and long primer, and an assortment of non-Caslon titling letter. Further, he used printer's ornaments only rarely, none of them cast by Caslon. Had he continued systemically to purchase additional Caslon type, the problem of differentiating his printing from Franklin's on the basis of the letter alone would have proved all but insolvable. Fortunately for this study he did not. His two later fonts of bourgeois are non-Caslon, and he seems never to have owned a font of brevier. Further, when William's uncle, Andrew Bradford died, he stipulated in his will that the nephew was to receive at the death of Cornelia Bradford — she died in 1755 — all of his "Printing Press Letter . . . if he shall behave himself handsomely towards her." 33 According to Isaiah Thomas, Cornelia had been responsible for disrupting an earlier partnership between Andrew and his nephew; 34 therefore William's chances of acquiring his uncle's fonts before 1755, if at all, would seem remote. But the letter in William's publications tells another story. By 1746 William was using Andrew's newest font of English, and by 1752 he appears to have gained possession of much of the remainder of Andrew's stock of type. Since Franklin and later Hall used only Caslon fonts and William Bradford, Jr., both Caslon and non-Caslon type, particularly the second after falling heir to his late uncle's letter, it is possible with close study to distinguish most later unsigned Franklin printing from that of Bradford. The identification of unsigned Bradford printing set in Caslon English and long primer is made the easier after 1748 by the fouling of these cases with non-Caslon sorts. Other than Franklin and the Bradfords, who were printing almost entirely in the English language, and Christopher Sauer, who was printing more in German than in English, Philadelphia in the 1740's had only a trio of struggling minor German printers — Joseph Crell and two Franklin partners, Gotthard Armbruster and Johan Boehm — all employing non-Caslon fonts or German scriptorial letter. In the large cities to the north, however, the important printers were all equipping their houses with Caslon. In New York City Franklin established a silent partnership with James Parker, the successor to the retiring William Bradford, Sr., and fitted the new shop with a complete stock of Caslon type by 1743. In Boston by the mid-forties Rogers and Fowle, Kneeland and Green, Gookin, and Henchman had all acquired Caslon fonts. In the 1750's two of the three new printers in English to set up shop in Philadelphia were men trained by Franklin, James Chattin and William Dunlap, the latter a Franklin partner in Lancaster before moving to Philadelphia. The third newcomer was Andrew Steuart. Chattin, active from 1752 to 1758, first in Lancaster and later in Philadelphia, possessed in addition to his Caslon English, long primer, and brevier, an assortment of distinctive non-Caslon fonts, which makes it relatively simple to distinguish much of his printing from Franklin and Hall's. Dunlap and Steuart, on the other hand, both starting their careers in 1758, reveal almost from the outset all-Caslon letter. Further-more, by 1754 James Parker had set up a printing house in Wood-bridge, New Jersey, employing Caslon type entirely, and by 1761, James Adams, a Franklin-trained printer, had begun using Caslon in his new shop located in Wilmington, Delaware. The two new Philadelphia printers in the early sixties were Peter Miller and Henry Miller, craftsmen whose houses were stocked with both German scriptorial and English roman and italic letter. The chief difference between the two is that Henry Miller, a former Franklin journeyman, employed for his publications in English all-Caslon text and titling type while Peter used largely non-Caslon fonts. This increasingly widespread use of Caslon by the printers both in Philadelphia and in the neighboring provinces makes it most difficult after 1753 to identify by means of the letter alone an unsigned Franklin and Hall publication, and between 1758 and 1766, well nigh impossible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There remains finally the need to discuss the pattern of the accompanying series of plates and of the digest of known fact concerning each font exhibited, for these plates and their related commentary constitute the basic evidence by which future bibliographers may test the validity of the conclusions presented in the earlier sections of this paper and carry on independent research in eighteenth-century American printing among the Middle Colonies. There are in all twenty-four plates, seven showing a variety of fonts widely used by Franklin's competitors during the years when Franklin was sole master of his establishment, fifteen reproducing the text fonts used by Franklin or by Franklin and Hall, and two offering selected samples of the Franklin titling type plus his very limited holdings of English scriptorial and pica Greek letter. In each plate exhibiting a text font it was my intention to achieve two objectives: (1) to reproduce at actual size a twenty-one line segment of the font with representative samplings of both the roman and italic letter, and (2) to present considerably enlarged a key selection of characters designed to assist the scholar in identifying a particular type. The first objective has not been fully realized in every plate, but since the fonts owned by Franklin and his Philadelphia competitors often differ markedly, the samples pictured should offer the scholar a reasonably workable basis for positive identification. Several obstacles stood in the way of achieving the first objective. The limited size of the plate prohibited the inclusion of a twenty-one line segment of the larger fonts, the double pica and paragon. Also it was not always possible to find among extant copies of Franklin's imprints set in smaller fonts twenty-one line segments combining representative settings of both the roman and italic letter, or where such examples were found, uneven impression in the original printing or defects such as extreme warping, faded inking, and tears, stains, or distorting repairs made satisfactory photographic reproduction unfeasible. Among the black letter fonts, it was difficult or on occasion impossible to find extended passages from which to choose a suitable example. With each segment of type in mass, regardless of size, I have appended a millimeter rule so that the scholar may test for himself the degree of accuracy with which the letter has been reproduced at life size and make compensations where the enlargement varies a millimeter or two. The second objective, that of reproducing much enlarged and truly characteristic a series of letters useful in identifying a specific font, was likewise a task beset with difficulties. Any enlargements as great as those offered on the plates will of necessity involve a certain amount of distortion, the smaller the characters as those reproduced from the fonts of brevier and bourgeois, the greater the distortion. Furthermore, those letters recurring frequently in a font designed for setting copy written in English may be cast from a series of matrices, rather than from a single one, and therefore may differ slightly in tilt depending on how the puncheon was held when the matrix was struck; hence, despite my careful scanning of many occurrences of the same letter before selecting what was considered a truly characteristic example, it is possible that I may have reproduced only one typical casting where several are present in a given font. Another complication in selection arose from the fact that it was not possible consistently to present reproductions of letters in settings which exhibited the font fresh from the foundry. And even where this was possible, the user of the plates must be wary of what changes in appearance may occur in individual characters after years of use when the sharpness of line is blunted, the terminals distorted, and tails, ears, finials, and beaks damaged. Two other points need brief words of explanation. First, key letters have been presented greatly enlarged in order that one may perceive more easily the distinctive design of the characters: the curvature of bowls, contour of arms, and variation in terminals. The letters in enlargement are not to be considered an accurate basis for judging the relative size of one character to another. Use rather the sampling of the font in mass as the basis for making that judgment. Second, the characters enlarged include many more capitals than lower case letters. The reasons for such a selection are that: (1) in the Franklin period it was compositorial practice to capitalize all important nouns; hence capitals abound in the texts under consideration; (2) many of the capitals exhibit distinctive variations, especially in arms, stems, beaks, finials, and spurs; and (3) these characteristics may be the more readily discerned in the larger capitals than in the lower-case letters. In the enlarged reproduction of characters in the black letter fonts, of which Franklin and the Bradfords had clearly limited supplies and which they employed most frequently in setting advertisements in their newspapers, hastily printed on inferior grades of native paper, I had the greatest difficulty in discovering wholly satisfactory examples; since, however, almost every character in Franklin's long primer font differs from that in the Bradfords, I have chosen to offer the characters as I found them and have refrained from retouching them in order to suggest their original full design.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The commentary accompanying each plate includes approximately the same kind of information. The first entry gives the name of the printer or printers using the font; the eighteenth-century name for the font; its twenty-line measurement in millimeters except for that of the titling type where the height of the capital is given; and the terminal dates of use of a particular font by one or more printers. The second entry, "Key Letters," offered for all but the Caslon fonts, includes descriptions of individual characters useful in identifying the font quickly. The aim usually has been to designate characters which make it possible for the scholar at a glance to distinguish the Franklin letter from the same letter in fonts used by his contemporaries. The third entry, "Comment," includes information concerning the years during which the font was regularly in use and in some instances the transference of a font from one printing house to another. This entry often includes also in a second paragraph the names of printers other than Franklin using a like font during the same years. The final entry, "Occurrences," lists a sampling of imprints wherein the particular font has been used. A number preceded by "C" refers to the entry of the work in W. J. Campbell's A Short-Title Checklist of all known Franklin Imprints ; a number preceded by "E" refers to the entry in C. Evans' American Bibliography ; and a number preceded by "H" refers to the entry in C. R. Hildeburn's A Century of Printing: the Issues of the Press of Pennsylvania, 1685-1784 . PLATE No. 1 FRANKLIN Long Primer No. 1 67 mm. 1728-1743 Key Letters: (Roman) the lower case r with blunt ear, the letter when set between e's or i's falling appreciably short of the mean-line; (Italic) the lower case w characterized by the sweeping downward curving of its head. Comment : This font Franklin used from the spring of 1728 until May 3, 1739, when he acquired his Caslon long primer. Thereafter the non-Caslon letter appears sporadically in Franklin printing until its discard late in 1743; it continues in use, however, in the standing type of the Poor Richard Almanacks until 1747. Type identical with Franklin's long primer No. 1 occurs from January 8, 1732 until March 10, 1733, in The South-Carolina Gazette , printed by Thomas Whitmarsh, Franklin's partner in Charleston; on March 17, 1733, the roman letter with its distinctive lower case r is replaced by another roman font, but the italic like Franklin's persists in the printing of Whitmarsh and his successors, Louis and Peter Timothy, until March 9, 1747.

PLATE No. 2 FRANKLIN Pica No. 1 84 mm. 1728-1738 Key Letters : (Roman) the capital G with sheared serif on upper arm and lower armed spur, the capital S with upper armed barbed serif; (Italic) the capital G with lower armed spur, the distinctive swash capital J and P , the lower case w with center loop and head with sheared inverted terminal. Comment : Franklin used this font from the spring of 1728 until May 4, 1738, after which date the earlier font disappears. See comment for Franklin's English No. 1. Type identical with Franklin's pica No. 1 occurs from January, 1732 until March 9, 1747, in The South-Carolina Gazette .

PLATE No. 13 KEIMER — HARRY Pica 83 mm. 1725-1730 Key Letters: (Roman) the lower case w with the two inner stems joining only at apex; (Italic) the lower case w with head terminals linking apex and stems. Comment : This is Samuel Keimer's lone pica font acquired in 1725, and turned over to his successor, David Harry, who used it in Philadelphia from 1729 to 1730, before taking it with him to Barbados. Occurences : KEIMER — 1728 : E3051; E3905. 1728-1729 : Pa. Gazette , Nos. 1-39. HARRY — 1730 : E3323, E3350.

Comment : This pica, the third used by Andrew Bradford since he had begun printing in 1713, appeared first in the American Weekly Mercury on December 9, 1736. Cornelia Bradford, Andrew's widow, used the font from 1742-1746. It passed to William Bradford, Jr. in the early 1750's. Occurrences : A.

PLATE No. 15 FRANKLIN English No. 1 95 mm. 1728-1742 Key Letters: See descriptions under Franklin's Pica No. 1. Comment: The face of this English font is the same as that of Franklin's Pica No. 1. Franklin used this font from the spring of 1728 until late in 1742. He acquired his first font of Caslon English probably in the summer of 1740; it first appears in the Gazette on September 18, 1740. He used his old and new fonts concurrently from 1740 to 1742. Type identical with Franklin's English No. 1 occurs from January, 1732 to March 9, 1747, in The South-Carolina Gazette . The same type badly rubbed occurs in E6954 dated 1753 with the Newport imprint of Franklin's nephew James. The pica of this font — Franklin's Pica No. 1 — also markedly worn occurs in an unsigned 1757 broadside announcing a Rhode Island lottery. I have not yet made an extensive examination of the Franklin Newport imprints, but the occurrence of these worn fonts in Rhode Island printing suggests the possibility that some years after B. Franklin had purchased his new Caslon English and pica he may have sent his earlier non-Caslon fonts to Newport where in 1738 his brother's widow took over the shop until her son James could be educated and trained to the printing business in Philadelphia by his uncle. Occurrence: 1733 : C49, E3710; C50, E3711. 1735 : C84, E3884. 1736 : C99, E4061. 1738 : C126, E4327. 1741 : C187, E5033. 1742 : C237b, E5033. 1743 : C283, E5272. 1729-1740 : Pa. Gazette, passim . PLATE No. 16 KEIMER - HARRY English No. 2 92 mm. 1726-1730 Key Letters: (Roman) the capital C with its stubby rounded finials; (Italic) the lower case g extending above the mean-line. Comment: This is Keimer's second font of English, not the first "small, wornout font of English" which Franklin found in the shop when he applied to Keimer for a job in October, 1723. Keimer turned over the font to David Harry, who used it in 1729-1730 before taking it with him to Barbados. Occurrences: KEIMER — 1728: E3051. 1728-1729: Pa. Gazette , Nos. 1-39 passim . HARRY — 1730: E3323. PLATE No. 17 FRANKLIN Double Pica No. 1 Cap. 5 mm. 1728-1741 Key Letters: (Roman) capital C with barbed beaks, the small bowl of the lower case g, the lower case v with the apex frequently above the base-line, and lower case y extending above the mean-line; (Italic) swash capital J , heavy stemmed with markedly rounded foot and head terminals, backward tilt of bar in capital H and of head serif on capital L , rounded terminal on head of lower case w . Comment: This font acquired in the spring of 1728 Franklin used often as text type for broadsides and for section headings in printing the Provincial laws as well as for titling type. Once he had acquired his large assortment of Caslon titling type in 1741 and his Caslon fonts of great primer and paragon, his use of double pica in either non-Caslon or Caslon became negligible. Type identical with Franklin's Double Pica No. 1 occurs in The South-Carolina Gazette from January, 1732 to March, 1747. Occurrences : 1729 : C7. 1730 : C16, E3252. 1733 : C49, E3710; C59, E3625. 1734 : C62, E3822. 1735 : C77, E3862; C90, E3905. 1736 : C98, E3986; C99, E4061. 1738 : C123, E4298. 1740 : C148, E4524; C163, E4600; C183, E4651. 1741 : C200, E4722; C209, E4792. PLATE No. 18 BRADFORDS Double Pica No. 2 Cap. 5 mm. 1728-1758 Key Letters: (Roman) lower case g with large bowl and elongated curved ear; (Italic) capital G with spur, and lower case w with lengthy sheared head. Comment: A. Bradford acquired this font in 1728, Cornelia used it until 1746, and then turned it over to W. Bradford, Jr., who by the early 1750's had combined it with his own double pica.

BRADFORD, JR. — 1758 : E8205 PLATE No. 19 FRANKLIN Black Letter Long Primer 66 mm. 1734-1766 Key Letters: the capital and lower case S's may be used to distinguish this font from that used by Andrew and William Bradford, Jr., and from Franklin's brevier black letter. Comment: Franklin used this font first on October 31, 1734, and consistently thereafter until September 2, 1742, when he began using his Caslon brevier black letter either alone or in conjunction with the long primer. Occurrences: 1734-1766 : Pa. Gazette, passim . 1735-1747 : Poor Richard Almanacks . 1737 : C106, E4138. PLATE No. 10 BRADFORDS Black Letter Long Primer 67 mm. 1723-1748 Key Letter: Capital S. Comment: A. Bradford acquired this font early in the 1720's, Cornelia used it until 1746, and turned it over to W. Bradford, Jr., by September 3, 1747. Occurrences: A and C. BRADFORD — 1723-1746 : Am. Weekly Mercury, passim . W. BRADFORD, JR. — 1747-1748 : Pa. Journal , Nos. 250, 290. PLATE No. 11 FRANKLIN Black Letter Brevier 54 mm. 1742-1766 Foundry : Caslon. Comment: Franklin first used this font in the Gazette on September 2, 1742, and thereafter principally in advertisements written in the German language until 1766. Occurrences : 1742-1766 : Pa. Gazette , Nos. 716, 743, 756-57, 773, 814, 818, 820, 880, 899, 972, etc. PLATE No. 12 FRANKLIN Brevier Nos. 1-3 54 mm. 1740-1766 Foundry : Caslon. Comment : Franklin first used his Caslon Brevier No. 1 on July 17, 1740, and thereafter consistenly until he acquired his second font of Caslon brevier (No. 2), first used on September 27, 1750. Brevier No. 1 continued to appear in the standing type of Gazette advertisements until December 19, 1752. Caslon Brevier No. 3, ordered by Franklin in all roman, appears first on February 19, 1761; thereafter No. 2 and No. 3 occur side-by-side in the Gazette until 1766. Occurrences : 1740 : C145, E4506; C177, E4636. 1741 : C200, E4722; C207. E4704; C228, E4856. 1757 : C608, E8041. 1764: C695, E9669. 1740-1766 : Pa. Gazette , passim . PLATE No. 13 FRANKLIN Bourgeois No. 1 57 mm. 1744-1746 Key Letters: (Roman) the unusually large capital W and the lower case w with its enlarged terminal on the far stem; (Italic) the swash A , the curved head terminal on the first stem of the capital M and N , and the arched apex of the lower case w . Comment : This font is the only non-Caslon text type acquired by Franklin after 1738. Its infrequent use and abrupt appearance and disappearance in the mid-forties are puzzling. Occurrences : 1744 : C289, E5396. 1746 : Pa. Gazette , Nos. 922-926. PLATE No. 14 FRANKLIN Bourgeois Nos. 2-3 57 mm. 1756-1766 Foundry : Caslon bourgeois No. 1 Comment : Bourgeois No. 2 makes its first appearance in the Gazette on September 24, 1756, and is used until the spring of 1759 when Bourgeois No. 3 is acquired and combined with No. 2. Occurrences : 1756-1766 : Pa. Gazette , passim . PLATE No. 15 FRANKLIN Long Primer No. 2 67.5 mm. 1739-1766 Foundry : Caslon long primer No. 1 roman Comment: This font first appears in the Gazette on May 3, 1739, and is used concurrently with Franklin's non-Caslon long primer until late in 1743. Thereafter the Caslon font is used exclusively except in the standing type of the Poor Richard Almanacks through 1747. W. Bradford, Jr. had acquired a font of Caslon long primer by December 23, 1746, and put into use a second font of Caslon long primer on March 11, 1756, in the Pa. Journal . Chattin by 1753, Dunlap and Steuart by 1758, and Henry Miller by 1761 were all using fonts of Caslon long primer in Philadelphia. Occurrences : 1739 : C138, E4453. 1740 : C163, E4600; C170, E4613; C175, E4633; C182-83, E4650-51. 1741 : C200, E4722; C209, E4792; C228, E4856. 1742 : C237, E5033. 1748 : C381, E6238; C385, E6165. 1749 : C412, E6300; C417, E6320; C431, E6412. PLATE No. 16 FRANKLIN Small Pica 74 mm. 1738-1766 Foundry : Caslon small pica roman and italic No. 2 Comment : Franklin first used this font in the Gazette on May 4, 1738. From that date until February 1, 1739, he substituted inverted lower case roman d's and n's for the missing p and u sorts.

PLATE No. 17 BRADFORDS Small Pica 72 mm. 1733-1746 Key Letters : (Roman) lower case g with small bowl and vertical ear; (Italic) swash capital B , D , and P . Comment : A. Bradford first used this font on December 22, 1733. W. Bradford, Jr. appears never to have used this letter. Occurrences : A and C. BRADFORD — 1733-1746 : Am. Weekly Mercury , passim . PLATE No. 18 PRANKLIN Pica No. 2 84.5 mm. 1738-1766 Foundry : Caslon pica roman No. 1 Comment : Pica No. 2 first appeared in the Gazette on May 4, 1738, and was used thereafter until 1766. Twenty-eight years is an exceedingly long period for the steady though light use of one font, and it is quite possible that Franklin may have acquired an additional quantity of Caslon pica in the interval, but I have found no evidence either in the correspondence or printing to support the point. W. Bradford, Jr. began using his font of Caslon pica by June 6, 1745. Andrew Steuart, William Dunlap, and Henry Miller were all using theirs early in the 1760's.

PLATE No. 123 FRANKLIN'S EARLIER TITLING TYPE No. 1 French Canon No. 1 Cap. 11.5 mm. 1728-1766 Key Letters : (Roman) capital R with double curved tail, capital E with tilted lower arm, lower case e with slanted bar; (Italic) capital G noticeably condensed, lower case e extending above mean-line. Comment : Franklin owned no larger titling type until 1741. Thereafter he used it concurrently with his French Canon No. 2 through 1747. After 1748 Hall mixed it with his French Canon No. 2. Type identical with Franklin's French Canon No. 1 occurs in the shop of Keimer and his successor, David Harry, until Harry's removal with the font to Barbados in 1730.

The font occurs in the 1782 Sale Catalogue of James' Punches and Matrices as Scriptorial English No. 1. T. B. Reed, op. cit. , p. 199, identifies the letter as one of the two fonts of English occurring in the foundry of Thomas Grover in the earlier decades of the eighteenth century. No. 8 Greek Pica 1744 Comment : This brief passage set in Greek pica, Franklin's lone use of Greek letter, occurs in a footnote for James Logan's translation of Cicero's Cato Major , 1744: C290, E5361. Andrew Bradford in 1738 (E4246) and William Bradford, Jr. in 1753 (E7112) revealed in their printing a considerably larger quantity of Greek pica. William by 1750 had acquired even a small quantity of Hebrew type (E6515).</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Nathanael West: A Bibliography by William White</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THERE IS ALMOST A 'STAR-CROSS'D' QUALITY IN both the life and literary career of Nathanael West. When he was graduated from Brown University in 1924, the college annual said, 'He seems a bit eccentric at times, a characteristic of all geniuses.' His first novel, The Dream Life of Balso Snell , dispensed entirely with plausibility, and his other three could certainly be labeled 'grotesque.' If Balso Snell was ignored and A Cool Million called a disappointment, Miss Lonelyhearts and The Day of the Locust were highly regarded by his friends, especially Edmund Wilson. Yet A Cool Million was remaindered; Miss Lonelyhearts came out just as Live-right was going bankrupt; and when The Day of the Locust had sold but 1,480 copies, West wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald, 'So far the box score stands: Good reviews—fifteen per cent, bad reviews—twenty-five percent, brutal personal attacks—sixty per cent.' Although he went to Hollywood after 20th Century-United Artists bought Miss Lonely-hearts , he never worked on the script and it came out under another title; and except for RKO's 'I Stole a Million,' his talents were wasted by the movies on Westerns and B-pictures. Nine months after he married his Irish beauty they were both killed in an auto collision in California. The New York Times account of the accident featured his wife, the Eileen of 'My Sister Eileen,' put her in the headline, misspelled his name, got two of the titles of his novels wrong, erred on his age and in other particulars. Even his sister-in-law, Ruth McKenney, got his age wrong in her book, Love Story , as do Stanley J. Kunitz and Howard Haycraft's Twentieth Century Authors (also the day of his death), Malcolm Cowley's Exile's Return , and most other accounts. Those who have written on West cite his four novels, but there is no bibliography of his work and of writings about him. He is ignored by Alfred Kazin's On Native Grounds (New York, 1942), by W. M. Frohock's The Novel of Violence, 1920-1950 (Dallas, 1950), by Blanche Housman Gelfant's The American City Novel (Norman, 1954), and by Fred B. Millet's Contemporary American Authors (New York, 1940), which treats 219 writers. The three-volume Literary History of the United States (New York, 1948), edited by Robert Spiller and others, gives him but two sentences; Lewis Leary's Articles on American Literature, 1900-1950 (Durham, 1954) lists only one article about him, and the Hoffman-Allen-Ulrich The Little Magazine (Princeton, 1946) gives his name in one place and spells it wrong. James Hart's Oxford Companion to American Literature omitted him from the first edition (New York, 1941) and the second edition (1948), but in the third edition (1956) he is given a brief paragraph. In addition to his being treated in the Oxford Companion , there are other indications that Nathanael West may be given the attention many think he deserves. A Ph.D. dissertation and at least two M.A. theses have been written on his work; Miss Lonelyhearts and The Day of the Locust have both been reprinted by New Directions in their 'New Classics' series; these two and A Cool Million were recently published in London; Miss Lonelyhearts and The Day of the Locust have been reissued in paperbacks; Miss Lonelyhearts was translated into French; and finally, critical essays—such as those by Robert M. Coates, Malcolm Cowley, Richard B. Gehman, Alan Ross, and Edmund Wilson—continue to appear from time to time. An ironical footnote to West criticism is that the longest essay yet printed, in the Western Review , which the editors called 'definitive,' resulted in a charge of plagiarism. 1 Asked to choose the 'most undeservedly neglected book' of the past twenty-five years, Leslie A. Fiedler wrote in the Autumn 1956 American Scholar that he considered A Cool Million but decided against it because West had 'after all, achieved [a] reputation, though not for the works I prefer.' While this reputation is not yet fixed, it is surely true that West at the moment is neither brutally attacked by critics nor completely ignored. Finally, in May 1957 Farrar, Straus and Cudahy issued The Complete Works of Nathanael West , containing the four novels and an introduction by Alan Ross (from Horizon ). The Saturday Review put his portrait on its cover, every review I have seen has been laudatory, and The New Yorker said the book 'contains some of the best writing that has been produced by an American in this century.' To paraphrase Richard B. Gehman: 'Seventeen years after his death: that is the final ironic, tragic, Westian joke.'</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Both of the antagonists in the dispute, Mr. Herman H. Levart and Mr. Cyril M. Schneider, sent me their bibliographies and other material; and Dr. James F. Light's dissertation has also been helpful. I am further indebted to the publishers, Random House, New Directions, and Bantam Books; to studios, RKO Radio, 20th Century-Fox, and Universal-International; and to Professor I. J. Kapstein, Mrs. Daniel J. Donno, and Mr. Harry L. Nolder, Jr. 2 According to the University Recorder of Brown University, this is Nathanael West's real name and birth date, coming from West himself. In college he used the name Nathan Wallenstein Weinstein or N. von Wallenstein-Weinstein. Wallenstein was his mother's maiden name, and Professor I. J. Kapstein, who knew him at Brown, says 'von Wallenstein' is 'the full flowering of romantic invention. Nathaniel [which he also used at Brown] likewise.' His sister Laura gives her maiden name in Who's Who in America (under the listing of her husband S. J. Perelman) as Laura West. 3 'A Barefaced Lie,' Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine , n. s. LXXXVII (July 1929), 210, 219, is signed N. West; but neither by subject matter nor style does it seem to be written by Nathanael West. 4 Another Brown University magazine, The Brown Jug , has a note in the December 1922 issue: 'Contributors to This Issue: N. Weinstein '24.' But he was not on the staff, and no articles were signed by his name or initials. 5 These ten letters, which I have not seen, are listed in the bibliography of James F.

      <field name="heading_text">The Second Edition of the Compagnia Del Mantellaccio by Curt F. Bühler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A small body of literature has grown up about that anonymous, witty poem entitled La Compagnia del Mantellaccio , formerly (and incorrectly) ascribed to Lorenzo de' Medici. Under no. 7260, the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke describes the only fifteenth-century edition of this work recorded by the Kommission: [Florence: Francesco di Dino], 13 April 1489. A facsimile of this printing, together with a listing and discussion of the then-known editions of this poem (thirteen in all, printed between 1489 and 1817) had previously been issued by R. Salari (Florence: Antonio Cecchi, 1861). Lastly, an article by the Marchese Roberto Ridolfi ("La 'Compagnia del Mantellaccio'e la sua sconosciuta edizione originale," La Bibliofilia , XLII (1940), 282-288) described the earliest existing edition from the unique copy in the author's library [Florence: Bartolommeo di Libri, 1482/3]; in a postscript, Ridolfi noted still another fifteenth-century printing, of which the only known copy then belonged to Dr. Giuseppe Martini. Ridolfi expressed the belief that this was the second edition of this "bizzarra composizione quattrocentesca," an opinion which the present article seeks to confirm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Martini copy of this edition of the fifteenth-century poem is now in the Pierpont Morgan Library and may be described as follows: Compagnia del Mantellaccio, [Florence: Bartolommeo di Libri, 1488]. 4°. 4 leaves. [a 4 ]. Type-page (33 lines): 160 x 73 mm. Type 1:97 1 . folio 1: (d 2 ) Inuouo cise facto una criocca || socto humilta creata &amp; in feruore || . . . (f. 4 v , line 30): dir togli togli hor lieuati diquince || Tanto glifece adosso strecta chaccia || Finita lacompagnia del mantellaccio ||</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The only recorded copy is in the Pierpont Morgan Library ( Check List no. 1133A). It measures 199 x 132 mm. and is bound in brown morocco as item 3 in a "Sammelband" containing: (1) Luigi Pulci. La Confessione . [Florence: Tubini and Ghirlandi, 1510]; (2) Luigi Pulci. Frottole due . [Florence: Societas Colubris, 1499]; and (4) Epistola consolatoria dei Caldi, Freddi, e Tiepidi . [Florence: Lorenzo Morgiani, 1496]. The volume was formerly in the collections of William Roscoe, Richard Heber, Sir George Holford, and Giuseppe Martini. Obtained by the Morgan Library in February, 1948.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Due to the happy circumstance that Ridolfi, in addition to supplying certain specific readings, reproduced the first and last pages of his volume and that the 1489 text is available through the facsimile, it becomes easily possible to establish the position of the Morgan incunabulum in relation to the other two editions. Since the Morgan Compagnia del Mantellaccio contains only the shorter text (262 lines), without the additions ("la giunta facta di nuouo") found in the 1489 printing which extend the poem to 475 lines, it certainly belongs to the earlier redaction. The Morgan edition shares certain variant readings with the Ridolfi text: line 32: &amp; se il suo uista bene &amp; uoi il togliete (Morgan and Ridolfi) et se il suo uista bene uoi il togliete (1489 edition) line 97: Poi si riuolse da sinixtra mano (Morgan and Ridolfi) Poi si riuolse da sinixtra mano (1489) line 236: &amp; da sei mesi inqua non cene stata (Morgan and Ridolfi) [The 1489 text has "stato", though "stata" is required by the rhyme. This text also has incorrectly "mese".]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In other instances the Morgan Compagnia del Mantellaccio sides with the text of the 1489 edition: line 31: Ma fate uenire ad uoi el Solosmeo (Ridolfi) Ma fate ad uoi uenire el Solosmeo (Morgan and 1489) line 240: che di nouizii ha seco una funata (Ridolfi) che di nouizi ha seco una chiassata (Morgan and 1489) line 249: &amp; sta poi audir gli statuti nostri (Ridolfi) &amp; sta audir poi gli statuti nostri (Morgan and 1489) line 259: Pero non saccetti in queste prouince (Ridolfi) Pero nol mecterei in queste prouince (Morgan and 1489)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two lines deserve our special attention. In line 159, we find in the first edition a very curious bit of Latin, which Ridolfi reprints as: dilacuis renuis corpus sine more. For this mysterious text, Ridolfi offers a clever solution, namely that only by misreading a manuscript source could the compositor have arrived at this faulty passage. The Morgan and 1489 editions sensibly provide: dilaceremus corpus sine more. It is easy to see how the compositor could have misread the manuscript ending "-remus" as "renuis" by misinterpreting the minims; the "dilacuis" may be accounted for on the basis of dittography or dittology.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the next line (line 160, not 159 as Ridolfi states), the Morgan text has: Et lorenzo chalchagni il gran martire. While the Ridolfi text also provides the name of Lorenzo Calcagni, the 1489 edition substitutes that of Giulian Grassina, perhaps because Calcagni had died in the meantime. Both the gentlemen are shadowy figures. Who Grassina may have been, I have been unable to determine, unless he be identical (which seems doubtful) with the "Grassi (Jules), prof. de philos. et médec. 1498" listed by Chevalier (col. 1850); the former certainly seems to be the "Calcagni (Laurent), de Brescia, jurisc., 1478" noted by the same authority (col. 750). He is described by Jöcher ( Gelehrten-Lexicon , 1750-51, I, 1557) as "ein Edelmann und Eques auratus von Brescia, im 15 Seculo, war der Rechten Doctor, dabey ein Philosophus und Historicus." Possibly this Calcagni may be further identified as the author of the Frottola del Villan "per el Venerabile homo ditto Calcagno", which begins "O maluasio rio vilā". This was described as an incunabulum by Copinger (no. 1405) but is now assigned to an otherwise unidentified, early sixteenth-century, Italian press in Proctor's Index (no. 14063).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From the above discussion it becomes evident that the Morgan copy, since it agrees in part with the version as found in the Ridolfi volume and partly with the 1489 edition, was certainly printed after the former and before the latter. The type is a good deal more worn than in the first printing and does not contain the gothic capital C, present in the earlier incunable. It is not unlikely that the later di Libri printing, since it contains a great many of the readings subsequently appearing in the di Dino edition, served as the "copy" for this edition after suitable additions had been made; it may, therefore, be dated as not later than the early months of 1489, and probably in 1488. Under these circumstances, the Morgan incunabulum is unquestionably the second surviving edition of the Compagnia del Mantellacio .</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The First Book Printed at Bari: Additional Notes by Dennis E. Rhodes</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am now able to add a few corrections and details to my earlier account of the book printed at Bari in 1535 which may not be without interest for the historian of printing in Italy. 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(a) The author There is in the British Museum a smaller collection of poems which Niccolò Antonio Carmignano published under his own name in 1516: Le Cose vulgare de Missere Colantonio Carmignano. . . nouamente impresse , completed by Georgio di Rusconi at Venice on 23 December 1516. Since the majority of these poems are to be found in the Operette of 'Il Suavio Parthenopeo' printed at Bari in 1535, it is, after all, the author himself who discloses his identity and explains his pseudonym. The only portion of the 1535 book which is not to be found in the earlier Venice edition is the central part addressed to Donna Isabella de Aragonia, Duchess of Milan and Bari, which deals with Queen Bona Sforza and her departure for Poland. More sonnets and eclogues were added, and these one presumes were not written until after 1516. One of the characters in the third and fourth of the four eclogues is called Suavio in both editions: thus by 1516 Carmignano had already thought of the name which he was to use as his pseudonym nearly twenty years later. The two books end with an epistle, ten sonnets, and a poem on the Crucifixion, but the Bari edition adds two or three pages of new poems to the Virgin Mary. On the whole, however, it is in the first half an almost page-for-page reprint of the Venice edition. This discovery was in fact made forty years ago in an exhaustive article by Giovanni Rosalba in a periodical which for no good reason is not available in the British Isles. 2 I had an opportunity to consult it during a recent visit to Florence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(b) The printer The Manzoni—Fairfax Murray copy of the Operette having come up in a recent Paris sale-catalogue, a new possibility concerning the place of origin of Gillibert Nehou may now be surmised. Here it is stated that "l'imprimeur, Gilbert Nehou, ou de Néhou (?), devait être, selon toute probabilité, un normand des environs de Valognes". 3 In fact there is in Normandy, near Valognes on the Cherbourg peninsula, a small villlage named Néhou, from which the printer's family presumably took their name. But there is unfortunately no mention of Gillibert in the only book devoted to this parish, M.J.E. Lebredonchel's Histoire de la paroisse de Néhou, depuis les tems les plus reculés jusqu'à nos jours (Cherbourg, 1835).</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Proof-Sheet from Nicholas Okes' Printing-Shop by John Russell Brown</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first quartos of Shakespeare's King Lear (1608) and John Webster's The White Devil (1612), two works printed by Nicholas Okes in the early years of his career, have received considerable editorial attention in the present century. 1 It is now known that proof-correction during the printing of some of the sheets has resulted in numerous variants between different copies of both these first editions, and in both there seems to have been some special factor governing such correction; for King Lear the text was set from a particularly difficult manuscript copy 2 and for The White Devil the author appears to have intervened on at least one occasion in such a way as to disturb the regular methods of proof-correction. 3 These facts give particular interest to the discovery of a proof-sheet for a book printed by Okes and dated 1609, for this provides an example of what may be called the normal printer's corrections during the printing of a sheet in this printing-house. The proof-sheet is found in the Folger Shakespeare Library copy of John Tichborne's A Triple Antidote, against certaine very common Scandals of this time, . . . . (1609). That the manuscript corrections in this copy are indeed proof-corrections is proved by the facts that they occur on the outer forme of signature I and nowhere else in the book, and that they are mostly corrected in another copy of the same book which is in the Boston Public Library. 4 The concern of the corrector with broken or badly inked type makes it almost certain that he was one of Okes' workmen and not the author of the book. The manuscript corrections in the Folger copy are as follows: 1. Sig. I1. many [broken 'a'] —corrected in the margin to 'many'. 2. Sig. I1. human —corrected in the margin to 'humane'. 3. Sig. I1. power, —followed by a vertical mark, possibly erasing a stop or raised space. 4. Sig. I1. power established —corrected in the margin to 'power, established'. 5. Sig. I1. through —the defective 'r' underlined and a cross added in the margin. 6. Sig. I2 v . fame —corrected in the margin to 'fame,'. 7. Sig. I3. whereof —the defective 'f' underlined and a cross added in the margin. 8. Sig. I3. God —followed by a short vertical mark. 9. Sig. I3. fall [broken 'f'] —corrected in the margin to 'fall'. 10. Sig. I4 v . Bucer —corrected in the margin to ' Bucer ,'. Cropping has probably lost the full correction of 'God' on I3. The Boston copy shows that these corrections were carried out as follows: 1. The defective 'a' was probably replaced, but with a partly defective type. 2. and 3. The 'e' was added to 'human'; a space was mis-adjusted after 'power,' leaving a larger mark than any that could have been covered by the proof-corrector's ink mark; and, to justify the line, a space between two words was reduced and 'State' altered to 'ftate' ['ft' ligatured]. 4. The comma was added wrongly, giving 'powere, stablished', and in doing so a space was raised at one end of the line and 'as' misplaced above the line of type at the other end. 5. Apparently no change was made. 6. The comma was added, but the type disturbed to print 'fame' [with defective 'a']. 7. The defective 'f' was replaced by another, but still imperfect, type. 8. 'God' was changed to 'Gods' with some displacement of type in its vicinity. 9. The defective 'f' was replaced. 10. The comma was added. The Boston copy shows a very faint comma on I4 v after 'outcasts' (line 8) which is not visible in the Folger copy, but this is almost certainly due to faulty type or inking, and not to proof-correction. There are no certain variants between the two copies in this forme other than those listed above. It is clear that the proof-corrector was not thorough in marking faulty type (the page reproduced with this article shows several broken or badly inked letters that he missed), nor did he make every correction that a careful reading without reference to the copy could suggest (for example, on I4 v both copies read 'gouernors &amp;, Primates'). But, on the other hand, the correction of 'human' to 'humane' shows that he had preferential spellings which he would demand even at the cost of a new justification of the type, and the correction of 'God' to 'Gods' shows that he could occasionally read carefully, and perhaps consult the copy. It should also be noted that as the proof-corrector was rushed or uneven in fulfilling his task, so the workman who followed his instructions did so imperfectly, by displacing type, using defective letters or failing to notice all the correction marks. Something further may be added about the variants in King Lear and The White Devil . If those in this one forme of The Triple Antidote represent, as we may suppose, a normal treatment in this printing-house, then the belief that the variants in the other two works represent exceptional treatment is, by their dissimilarities, further strengthened. Moreover the fact that Okes' corrector was concerned with merely preferential changes and with purely typographical improvements in a book published in 1609, lends some support to Professor Fredson Bowers' contention that Okes was the sort of printer who was likely to do his 'conscientious best to produce the best text he could' from the 'miserable' manuscript copy for Lear in 1608. 5 The typographical improvements to The Triple Antidote also imply that there are probably more variants in both the other works than have been traced by human eyes alone, and that the full extent of their proof-correction during the printing of certain sheets will only be revealed by using an optical device such as that which Dr. C. Hinman is using on the first folio of Shakespeare. 6 To search for such typographical variants would not be an idle task; if they exist they would enable us to claim that Okes was at least concerned with the appearance of his printed page in King Lear , and they might help to determine which, in one or two doubtful formes, were the first states and which the 'corrected' ones.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of Sir George Croke's Reports by Lois Spencer</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An anonymous single sheet in the Thomason Collection, together with certain entries in the MS Court Book of the Stationers' Company, tells the story of a contest which ranged from printing-house to Parliament and which illustrates not only the keen competition within the London trade during the mid-seventeenth century, but also the complexities that arose with reference to the printing of legal text-books. The pamphlet (BM 669. f.20 [74]), which has no date, title, or name of printer, is catalogued by Fortescue under March 1658. Thomason's MS. Legal Year dating is "March 1657". It tells how About the 7 th of March 1655, Master Whiting and Master Spelman came to Richard Hodgkinsonne to treat about the printing of Judge Crookes 1 (or Sir George Crookes ) Reports; desiring the said Hodg . to tell him truly and conscientiously, what he would print it for by the sheete and finde Paper? The sum the said Hodgkinsonne then pitcht unto them was a farthing a sheete, the number printed being two thousand upon each sheete, and the Paper to be worth five shillings a Reame ( viz. five shillings and six pence perfect) so for that time they parted: But shortly after Master Whiting came to the said Hodg. with one Master Bacon , and desired the said Hod. to make some Proves, which he accordingly did. About the 12 of September 1656 Mr. Jo. Whiting , and M. Clem. Spelman went to the Warden of the Stationers ; where M. Whiting desired to have Sir G. Crookes Reports entred to the said Hodgkinsonne , declaring unto the said Warden that he had agreed with the said Hodg. for printing them and therefore willed him to take a care that none else should meddle with the printing of them. The 15 day M. Whiting , M. Spelman and Hodg. went to the Clerk, where M. Whiting declared the same words he had done before to the Warden, but the Clerke refused Entrance to the said Hodg. upon pretence of a former entry to one Warren . The 16 day M. Whiting and M. Spelman went to Stationers-Hall, and there at a publique Court M. Whiting disclaimed the Entrance of Warren , as surreptitious, and declared his agreement with Hodg . . . . but no Entry was made as he desired. After two more unsuccessful attempts in October and January, Whiting complained to the Lord Chiefe-Justice of the Upper-Bench , who (accompanied with 3 or 4 other of the Judges) after hearing all that could be said by the Company for neglecting to enter to Hodg. as also what Warren could say for his pretended claim; una voce Ordered, that the former pretended Entry to Warren , so surreptitiously obtein'd, should be obliterate , and the said Copy be Entred de novo to the said Hodgkinson. On the 20th of October, 1657, 2 Hodginson began to print "the 17 yeeres of King Charles". During the process, Whiting frequently visited "the Work-house" alone and with friends, to whom, and to the workmen, he declared that he had contracted with Hodgkinson to print the whole series, of which the present section amounted to less than one third. He also, before the workmen, chid Hodgkinson because he was still completing some other contracts, and "forbad him to entertain any other worke, assuring him that he would finde him worke for 7 yeers. And he hath", says the pamphlet, "driven Customers from his the said Hodg. house." An instance of two unnamed Booksellers who on March 23rd vainly asked Hodgkinson to undertake as much as he would of the printing of Lord Hubbard's reports is quoted, and Whiting is said to have urged Hodgkinson to hurry on and take no other work because "there were reports of one Bulstrode 3 Whitlocks printing, which he would not for 100 l. should come out before his 11 yeers of King James ", which he urged Hodgkinson to finish for him by Michaelmas. Shortly before he had finished the Caroline copy, therefore, Hodgkinson asked Whiting whether that for King James his time were ready or not; if it were not, and that the presse, for want thereof, should stand still, it would be very chargeable: Whereupon within a day or two after M. Whiting brought the said Copy into the said Work-house, where Hodg. cast it off, and concluded that the last 11 yeers of King James should make a second Volume. About the 30 of May King Charles was finished, and Hod. asking M. Whiting for the copy of King James . . . M. Whiting told him it was in Just. Hales hand for perusall, but promised faithfully to bring it to him in a fortnight: The said . . . Whiting came again within 2 or 3 dayes and desired Hodg. to provide work for a moneth, if he could; for (being tyred) he had a mind to goe into the Country; and then promised without faile to bring the said Copy to him, within a moneth; but failed then as before. Here the pamphlet infuriatingly ends, leaving the reader to check its accuracy for himself. 4 The Stationers' Register has an entry under 4 July 1656 (Eyre &amp; Rivington, Transcript ), headed "Thos. Warren", which runs:— Entred under the hand of Master Norton Warden a booke entituled The reports of Judge Crooke from the first yeare of the late K. Charles to the seaventeenth, being collected by his owne hand . There is no attempt at deletion, such as was ordered by the judges according to the pamphlet; nor is there any entry of the book to Hodgkinson. Wing, ( Short-Title Catalogue of English Books, 1641-1700 ) has no Hodgkinson entry either. In the British Museum, however, though not in Wing, is 6128.f.4, entitled:— THE / REPORTS / OF / S r George Croke Knight; / Late, one of the Justices of the Court / OF / KINGS-BENCH; / And formerly, one of the Justices of the Court / OF / COMMON-BENCH, / OF SUCH / Select Cases / as were adjudged in the said Courts, the time that he was / Judge in either of them : / Collected and written in French by Himself; Revised / and published in English / By Sir HAREBOTLE GRIMSTON Baronet, / One of the Benchers of the Honourable Society of Lincolns-Inn. / LONDON, / Printed by R. Hodgkinsonne , and are to be sold by William Leak at the Crown in Fleetstreet , / betwixt the two Temple Gates, by Thomas Firby neer Grays-Inne Gate in / Holborn , and at Lincolns-Inne Gate, 1657. A Parliamentary Order prefaced to the book and dated "Tuesday 9 June 1657", states that:— Whereas Sir Harebotle Grimston, Baronet, hath of late revised and published in English a Book, entituled, The Reports of Sir George Croke Knight . . . which book is lately allowed and approved by all the Judges of England. It is therefore Ordered by this present Parliament, that no person, other than the said Sir Harebotle Grimston, and his Assignes, or such as shall be authorised by him or them, presume to publish in print any of the said Books or any Copy thereof, either in French or English. The Order is signed in the customary way by Scobell. The book contains a recommendation, "Wee all, knowing the great Learning, Wisdome, and Integrity of the Author, do (for the common benefit) approve and allow of the publishing of this Book", signed by Judges Glynne, St. John, Atkins, Nicholas, Hale, Wyndham, Warburton, and Parker. It also contains the Preface by Grimston addressed "To the Students of the Common-laws of England" which is quoted below. This is dated "From my Manor-house of Gorhambury, May 7, 1657". On the final page is a list of Errata numbering 45 in all. Wing, under 'Sir George Croke', lists only one 1657 volume:—'The reports of. By J. S. , 1657 fol.' This volume (BM 6121 i 1 is entitled — THE / REPORTS / OF / Sir George Croke Knight; / Late, One of the Justices of the Court / OF / KINGS-BENCH; / AND / Formerly, One of the Justices of the Court / OF / COMMON-BENCH, / OF SUCH / Select Cases / As were adjudged in the said Courts, the time that / he was Judge in either of them . / Collected and written in French by Himself; / Revised, and published in English / By Sir Harebotle Grimston , Baronet, / One of the Benchers of the Honourable Society of Lincolns-Inn. / LONDON , / Printed by J. S. and are to be sold by the Stationers of London , / MDCLVII. It is much more roughly printed than the very attractive Hodgkinson copy. It has a different portrait-engraving as frontispiece and lacks the final emblem-engraving with which Hodgkinson concluded his book. It does not contain the Parliamentary Order. It compresses, by close printing, into 438 pages the section on which Hodgkinson lavished 603, and is therefore much more difficult to read. While Hodgkinson's Errata appear to be corrected, an equally long fresh list is inserted between Tables I and II, where it would not readily be observed. It contains the Preface, and the Judges' Recommendation, and the following Note to the Reader. Thou art desired to take notice, That in the Second Edition of this Book, many grosse Errors of the former are exactly corrected; and the Errors of this Edition are carefully taken notice of in an Errata: So that this Book is not onely more perfect then the former Impression, But also (for the good of the People of these Nations), it will be sold for half the Price. This volume is too distinctly dated to be that referred to by J. M. Rigg under Grimston, Sir Harbottle, in the Dictionary of National Biography (ed. 1890), which, after commenting that the "first volume of Grimston's translation of Croke's reports was published, with a life of the author, in 1657", adds, "There is also a very inaccurate edition of early but uncertain date". It is difficult to see which edition(s) Rigg is referring to here. Since the corrections indicated in Hodgkinson's "Errata" are carried out in the J. S. copy, one would, but for the dating, have thought that the Hodgkinson edition must be the "former" one referred to both in J. S.'s foreword and by Rigg as "inaccurate". But Hodgkinson too is clearly dated. It thus seems doubtful whether the "inaccurate edition of early date" referred to by the D.N.B. exists, unless Rigg never saw the Hodgkinson edition and referred to it. 5 Rigg does, however, mention the Parliamentary Order, which appears only in Hodgkinson. Before turning to the version of the story in the Court Books of the Stationers' Company, some facts about the situation and certain of the characters should be summarised. The controversy about the printing of law-books which this story exemplifies is of particular interest between 1641 and 1660, because the future of a monopoly was in doubt. Edward VI had granted to Richard Tottel by letters patent, endorsed by Elizabeth, 6 the exclusive right of printing common law books. This patent passed by grant through various hands until in the reign of James I it was granted to John More for forty years. 7 More assigned his rights to Miles Fletcher, in return for an annuity plus a third of the profits. More died in 1638, leaving the annuity to Martha, his daughter, wife of Richard Atkyns, who thus through her acquired the patent. 8 Fletcher, trying to evade payment of the annuity, bought up More's stock and equipment, and sought to sell the rights to the Company of Stationers. The action which Atkyns brought against him and the Company was interrupted by the Civil War. From then until the Restoration, therefore, the issue was undecided. The Company of Stationers, anxious that so important and lucrative a right should be in their own hands, sought mean-while to establish a tradition of authorization via priority of entry in their register. After the Restoration, complicated litigation eventually favoured Atkyns; the Company, however, was able in 1661 to purchase the right, but had still to contend with counter-claims by the Fletchers. It was during the previous indeterminate period that, as described in the pamphlet, Sir Harbottle Grimston sought to publish the legal reports of Sir George Croke. Sir George Croke is most generally known as one of the two judges who, in 1638, found against King Charles I on the question of the legality of ship-money. He died in 1642, leaving his legal Reports, covering three reigns and ranging from 1580 to 1640, in the charge of his son-in-law, Harbottle Grimston. This was fitting, for Croke had made it a condition of the marriage of his daughter, Mary, to Grimston in 1629 that the legal practice which the latter, who was a barrister of Lincoln's Inn, had at that time discarded, should be resumed. It was excellent advice; Grimston rose rapidly in his profession, becoming in 1634 Recorder of Harwich, which he represented in Parliament from 1638, Recorder of Colchester (1638-49), and Colchester's representative in the Short and Long Parliaments, of which he was a conspicuous member. Politically, his position was complicated. Son of a Puritan baronet, he became Deputy Lieutenant of Essex and Chairman of the Committee which in 1647 investigated Charles I's escape from Hampton Court. Rushforth lists him as having taken the Covenant. Burnet, who later became his chaplain, says he did not. He led the Isle of Wight negotiations for a personal treaty, opposed regicide, and was purged by Pride in 1648, imprisoned for a short time, and, when returned to Parliament in 1656, excluded. From 1649-1660 he lived in retirement, latterly at Gorhambury, an estate which he had acquired through a second marriage — once more an alliance with a great legal family — to Anne, daughter of Sir Nathaniel Bacon. 9 Part of this leisure (which was ended by his being elected Speaker of the Convention Parliament, in which capacity he rather floridly welcomed Charles II at the Restoration) he spent in wrestling with his former father-in-law's Reports. This was no easy task. The Reports, extending over so many years and by so eminent an authority, would necessarily form a legal reference-book of first importance. The current demand for such works, together with the unsatisfactory way in which it then was often met, is described by Grimston in the Preface to the Reports, vol. i. A multitude of flying Reports ( whose Authors are as uncertain as the times when taken, and the causes and reasons of the Judgements as obscure as by whom judged ) have of late surreptitiously crept forth; whereby, instead of that plentifull and profitable increase which those fields ( thus by a vigilant husbandman tilled ) would have yeelded to our Students, we have been entertained with barren and unwarranted Products . . . . which not only tends to the depraving the first grounds and reason of our Students at the Common Law, and the young Practitioners thereof, who by such false Lights are misled, and multiplicity of Law Suits rather cherished than suppressed : But also to the con tempt . . . . of divers our former grave and learned Justcies (sic) and Professors . . . . whose honoured and revered names have . . . . been abused and invocated to patronise the indigested crudities of those plagiaries . ( Reports of Sir George Croke (1657), sig. a2) Grimston therefore took upon himself "the resolution and task of extracting and extricating" the Reports "out of their dark originalls". Dark not only because in accordance with Parliamentary policy they must now be published in English, not French, but also because they were exceedingly difficult to read, " being written in so small and close an hand, that I may truly say they are folia sybillina, as difficult as excellent ." Grimston therefore used the help of "better eyes" than his own. That Richard Hodgkinson should have been much sought after at this time is not surprising. After difficulties financial, political, and professional, he had just reached the zenith of his fame as the printer (in 1655) of one of the most exacting and superbly printed books of the century, Sir William Dugdale's Monasticon Anglicanum (vol. I). In 1656 he printed, at the request of Sir Henry Spelman: " Villare Anglicum / OR / A VIEW OF THE TOWNES / of ENGLAND". (BM E.484[3]) which contains an attractively written foreword from the Printer to the Reader. Sir Henry Spelman had first recommended Dugdale to serve in the Office of Arms, and first introduced him to Roger Dodsworth, who originated, and probably wrote most of Monasticon but died before its completion. 10 But the second volume of Monasticon was to come in 1661 from the press of Alice Warren, Thomas's widow, 11 and in 1656 Dugdale's Antiquities of Warwickshire was printed by Thomas Warren. It seems possible, therefore, that round about 1655-56 rivalry existed between Hodgkinson and Warren towards the Dugdale-Spelman antiquarian axis. Warren was a skilful printer: he specialised in "portraictures cut in wood" ( Stat. Reg. 4 April 1656), and on 7 April 1656 is referred to as the printer of a 7-sheet map of London. He probably saw Hodgkinson's technical virtuosity, displayed in the first volume of Monasticon , as a menace to his own prospects. The Clement Spelman mentioned in the pamphlet was probably Sir Henry's fourth son (1598-1679), barrister, and from 1660 bencher of Gray's Inn. He wrote in 1647 a tract entitled Reasons for admitting the King to a Personal Treaty in Parlt. and not by Commissioners 12 and in 1648 a Letter to the Assembly of Divines concerning Sacrilege . According to the D.N.B. , "there was another member of his family of somewhat similar age and the same name" who may have been the Clement Spelman listed on 24 April 1648 as a sequestered delinquent; he may also have been the Clement Spelman of the pamphlet. The number of members of the Bacon family "of somewhat similar age and the same name" during the 1650s has made it impossible to identify with certainly the Bacon 13 mentioned in the pamphlet. It seems unlikely that Nathaniel Bacon, Member for Ipswich, is intended, as he was by now probably too well known to be mentioned by the vague "one Master Bacon". The Nicholas Bacon referred to at the end of this article may be a more likely candidate. The important question of the identity of Whiting is discussed later. The Court Book (1654-79) gives a more detailed account of the facts covered in the Thomason pamphlet, and adds much more. On 6 October 1656 Thomason and Leake were two of those present when This day came to the Court Mr. Richard Hodgkinson Printer &amp; with him one Mr. Spilman and demanded Entrance of a Booke called Judge Crookes Reports which they produced but the same booke being already (in July last) entred to Thomas Warren by authority &amp; direction (as he asserts) of one Mr. Whiting y e Proprietor — &amp; that in presence of one Mr. Bacon and Mr. Dugdale not now present — And Mr. Warren affirming also that he was bargain'd withall by the said Mr. Whiting for printing One Impression of the said Copies according to certain Articles agreed on &amp; drawn up (but not sealed) between them That he hath (in pursuance of the said agreement) caused to be cast a ffount of new Letter for ye doing thereof whereby he shall loose at least 20l. — if he be prevented from Printing thereof. To w ch it was replied that Mr. Warren had not the booke it selfe in his custody but had procured an Entrance by a Title only to w ch Mr. Warden Norton had set his hand. The Table debate the business and resolve that they cannot give their judgment in the premises untill they heare the said Mr. Whiting Mr. Bacon and Mr. Dugdale, and withall desired both parties to referre themselves to such persons as themselves shall thinke fitt to nominate; but that way not done. A further entry on 9 February 1656/7 runs:— Memorand that since the last Court the Master &amp; Wardens &amp; Mr. Norton were summoned before the Lord Ch. Justice Glyn &amp; Justice Atkins at Serjeants Inne where it was ordered by their Lordships that the Entrance of the booke called Crookes Reports made to Mr. Warren (his right therein being overruled) should be oblitterated. And this day came again Mr. Spilman Mr. Whiting &amp; Mr. Hodgkinson to demand the same &amp; Entrance of the said Copie to Mr. Hodgkinson. But forasmuch as the matter of right 14 in the Copie begot all the Controversie &amp; it not appearing that the present Claimers have any right derived from Sir Harb. Grimstone Esq re to the Author it was proposed &amp; accordingly promised by Mr. Spilman to obtaine from the said S r Harbottle a Signification of his consent to the purpose afores d . W ch the Table enclined to do to prevent a new mischiefe. On 2 March 1656/7, came againe to the Court Mr. Spilman and Mr. Whiting with a writing under ye hand of S r Harbottle Grimston (as was averred) according to ye motion of the last Co rt but our Master who is imediately concerned (in ye L d Cheife Justices Order) being absent by reason of sickness Mr. Spilman was prayed to forbeare pressing the business . . . . untill the M r . could personally come to the Court. At this point there is a year's gap before the next relevant Court Book entry. It seems that between March 2nd and June 9th, 1657, application was made to Parliament by Whiting and Hodgkinson for vindication of the Judges' ruling, which was secured by the Parliamentary order: and that Hodgkinson's was the edition referred to by Bulstrode Whitlocke as published on 25th June. Between that date and January-March 1657/8 appeared the unauthorised "J. S." edition. It will be remembered that this edition purported to be sold "by the Stationers of London". It would be interesting to know how much truth lay behind this expression. In 1664, John Streator printed under the name of Richard Atkyns the pamphlet entitled The Original and Growth of Printing , in which the previous attitude of the Stationers (to which the writer of the 1664 pamphlet is opposed) is summed up thus:— Say they, from the Year 1641 or 1642 until the . . . . Restauration, . . . . any Booksellers that listed, did print, or cause to be printed, such Law-Books as seemed good to them, without Restraint or Prohibition, occasioned by the Licence of the late Times. And that such as had Licence under the King's Grant to print Law-Books, were hindered to make the benefit of the same Grant; And that it was usual for such persons as printed Law-Books to enter the same in Stationers-Hall, and that it was conceived and taken, that such person and persons as Entred a Copy in the said Hall-Book to be Printed had the sole Right to print the same; and those that claim'd the Right of printing Law-Books under the King's Licence were thereby taken to be Excluded, and debarred to any Benefit therein. ( op. cit. pp. 15-16) In contrast to this policy, the Parliamentary Order of 9 June, 1657, might suggest some willingness on the part of the Commons to arrogate to themselves the previously royal right of granting the monopoly. 15 Such an attitude might appear as a threat to the procedure of right by entry in the Register which the Stationers sought to establish. It may be that in our instance the retention of the Warren entry, the refusal of a Hodgkinson entry, the postponements and the varying reasons given for them, are factors in a coherent if improvised policy which, on 9 February 1656/7, when blocked by the Judges over the question of printing rights, introduced the issue of inherent right so that action on the other count might again be postponed. If so, it might seem possible that the J. S. edition could have been printed or initiated with the concealed (or open) support of the Stationers' Company, though the legally non-committal phrase "Stationers of London" may equally well indicate the contrary. The identity of J. S. is, however, a question here. The obvious claimants are the two men thus initialled who participated in printing subsequent abridgements of the Reports: John Starkey and John Streator. Streator, who partnered Warren in this the very next year, seems the more closely linked, since he was, as assign of Richard Atkyns, deeply and frequently involved in litigation about the printing of law books; he was certainly and emphatically the advocate, in 1664, of individual (royal) rights, against the sale of the monopoly to the company of Stationers. Whatever the identity of J. S., we know that Whiting appealed to the House of Commons against the J. S. edition, for, while the Journal of the House for 20 Jan. 1657/8 has the entry "The humble petition 16 of John Whiteing, of Lincoln's-Inn, Esquire, was this day read", Burton's Parliamentary Diary for the same day reports the following discussion: Col. Cox. Your order concerning Sir Harbotle Grimston's Reports was broken; it was a violation of your privilege. I desire the petition may be read. The title was 'To the Right Honourable the High Court of Parliament' and it was read without further debate. The substance of it was, that against the orders of the House, the book was reprinted, in bad paper, with many faults, &amp;c and that they called it a monopoly, and the Parliaments were so consequently. ( sic ) Mr. Speaker . Upon complaint in this case, and to assert your privilege, I sent for three or four of the offenders, and bound them over to appear here the first day. There were some of them at the door even now. Major Beake . This is no breach of privilege, but rather a breach of the law. I would not have you to stay at the threshold, to take no order in this Case. Public business must take place, and if politicians meet with such an order upon your books, it will not look well to be the Antisignanus of this house. Mr. Speaker moved that a Bill be read; but it was called on to adjourn. There is also evidence that Grimston himself, if he was disappointed at the number of Errata in Hodgkinson's edition, was enraged by those of the J. S. edition, for in his Preface to the second volume of the Reports 17 he says, I have been more than ordinarily careful in the Edition, that the Reverend Reporter may not be blemished with those many Errata's in this, which have somewhat obscured the former: 18 Especially in that latter Edition of it, by some ignorant and mercenary persons, who care not how they blot mens Credits, and therein wrong the Reader, as well as the Learned and Judicious Reporter, so they may have a vendible impression. He adds that if despite his efforts some errors have slipped in "You will find them particularly corrected, in the usual place, after the end of this Book". 19 Whether because he had indeed previously made other arrangements, or because he felt that Hodgkinson had worked less accurately than the task demanded, or because he wanted no more bother with Whiting, Grimston seems to have decided to make a break over the printing of the Reports for King James's reign, which had for a time been placed in Hodgkinson's hands by Whiting. The Court Book on 19 Feb. 1657/8 has the entry that William Godbie Printer this day brought a letter directed to the Table from S r Harbottle Grimstone dat. 16 ffeb. 57 purporting the said S r Harbottle's desire y t Judge Crooks Reports in the tyme of King James might be Entred as y e copie of William Godbie but Mr. Hodgkinson having formerly left a Caveat against the same and being now present desired forbearance of the Entrance of y e same &amp; s th that Mr. Whiting (Assignee to S r Harbottle as he will prove) agreed with him for printing the same with many other Reports of . . . . Judge Crooke &amp; that fraudently the said Whiting got the said Copie (being left with M r Hodgkinson) from him under pretence of Judge Hales perusing of it &amp; never brought the same back. Hodgkinson secured suspension of the entry of the Book to anybody, pending his proof of his allegations, which he promised to produce at the next Court. On 19th March 1657/8, says the Court Book, Godby brought to the Court a letter from Grimston repeating the request of Feb. 16th and affirming the right to be in Godby only, "and that Mr. Hodgkinson was only employed in printing the Judiciall Reports which (if it had been Entred) he was to have given Bond for the copie." Hodgkinson presented a paper "purporting an assertion of his right in the Copie of the above Reports not only with consent but speciall approbation &amp; direction of . . . Grimstone and protesting against what shall be done to the prejudice of such his right." The Table decided to decide nothing at present but told the Clerk to go to Gorhambury, taking Hodgkinson's paper, and give Grimston a copy of it, asking to be fully informed about it. On March 26th, 1658, Godby presented to the Table Grimston's reply, which stated that Grimston "denies he ever assigned to Mr. Whiting his interests in any of Judge Crook's Reports except the Judiciall Reports in the first seventeen yeares of King Charles 2 ndly That Mr. Whiting's promise to Mr. Hodgkinson of printing the other parts . . . cannot devest S r Harbottle of his property . . . But admitting Mr. Hodg. had such a promise from Mr. Whiting or himself (which he utterly denies) he has no remedy upon failure of performance but to bring his case . . . to recover his Damages. . . ." It would not, says Grimston, be for the Company to "meddle" with such action, but to "leave him to a legall way". Grimston then repeats his request for assignment to Godby. The court at last decided, at the end of the sitting, that though Hodgkinson had shown the Table a copy signed by several witnesses to the agreement with Whiting, this was, as Grimston urged, a legal matter, not a case for them to decide: since Hodgkinson's possible redress would not be prejudiced by entry of the Reports to Godby, it was decided to assign the Jacobean volume to him. 20 Hodgkinson had thus won the first round only to be defeated in the second. But though he appears to have sought no legal redress, he did take what is now called unilateral action, for a Court Book minute of 7 February 1658/9 records that he had been found at some previous date "printing Judge Crook's Reports contrary to order" and his goods were seized and taken to Stationers' Hall. A "friendly agreement" having now been reached between Hodgkinson and Field (the bookseller for whom Godby and Newcomb issued the Jacobean volume in 1659) it was decided that these should be restored. Grimston's labours continued. The second Part, commended by eight Judges and without Parliamentary Order, was duly printed by T. Newcomb and W. Godbie, to be sold by John Field at the Seven Stars in Fleet-Street, in 1659. Both of the copies I have seen (BM 6128.f.3 and that in the Library of the Institute of Historical Research, London) have been rebound, which may possibly account for the absence in each of the Errata, referred to by Grimston in the Preface. (The Second Edition of Part II (1669) describes itself as "corrected".) The First Part (for Elizabeth's reign) appeared in 1661 "Printed by and for John Field and Tho. Newcomb : Also for W. Lee, D. Pakeman, and Gabriel Bedell ." It has a highly rhetorical Dedication to King Charles II in which Grimston avers that the Third and Second Parts would have been similarly dedicated but for "the extream difficulty of publick Address to Your Majesties Sacred Person, divided from Your good Subjects, by the cruel, wicked, bloody, and desperate practises of horrid Intruders and Usurpers", which had forced him to send them abroad with only a Preface. The names of eleven Judges, but no Parliamentary Order, commend it. The Errata, inserted between the reports and the Tables, form a staggering list of 57 lines in each of two columns in very small print. Perhaps, after all, Grimston would have been better advised to stick to Hodgkinson. The equivocal part played by Whiting in this story deserves comment. The chief clue to his identity is the "of Lincolne's-Inn" description in the Parliamentary Journal for 20 January 1657/8, which seems to fix him as the John Whiting, son and heir of Thomas Whiting of Saxlingham, Norfolk, who was admitted on 10 November 1624, and had been admitted pensioner at Caius, Cambridge, on 28 May 1619, "son of Thos. Gent., of Saxlingham, Norfolk". The BM catalogue describes him as "Bookseller", on the strength of the word "Proprietor" in the Thomason pamphlet, one supposes, for his name occurs in no other place where a bookseller's should, so far as I can discover. It will have been noticed that throughout the story Grimston never appears in person. He would scarcely have felt himself persona grata in London during the year following his exclusion from Parliament. He may therefore in the first instance have acted through a friend, representative, or associate rather than a stationer. In the Preface to the Hodgkinson volume he mentions the help of "better eyes" than his own. Such a helper would need to have had a legal training and/or practice with documents. John Whiting of Lincoln's Inn would possess these qualifications. Roger Dodsworth, in a letter to Sir William Dugdale dated by Hamper ( Life, Diary &amp; Correspondence of Sir William Dugdale , 1827) March 1649/50, says: "Mr. Whiting was w th me this morning, and tells me ther is a great man called Paston, whose father was a studious man after antiquities, especially Abbey Books, and hath left Collections out of divers, w ch Mr. Whiting is to p'use. He will serve you by Sir Charles Mordants' deeds", and on 10 May, 1651, he tells Dugdale that Mr. Whiting has "come up last weeke but is gone today w th rare Historical notes out of several Registers he found in Suffolke, touching St. Edmundsbury." In an article by Falconer Madan in the Athenaeum (3 November 1888) which reprints the previously missing section of Dugdale's diary for 1656, occurs, under 14 September, the entry:—"Sent to Mr. Martin the Register at Lichfield 6 s , whereof 2 s 6 d I am to receive of Mr. Whiting the Lawyere, 21 it being for the search of the will of one Thwaites of Henoure." Since "Mr. Dugdale", according to the Court Book, accompanied Whiting on his Hodgkinson negotiations, it seems that the Whiting referred to above, who may have been recommended to Grimston by the Dugdales as one competent to help in deciphering Croke's sibylline leaves, would be a not unlikely person for Grimston to choose as his negotiator. If he made any subsequent excursions into the world of the printers of law books, he would have needed to walk warily after the Restoration, for Grimston then became Master of the Rolls. There remains a faint and very conjectural possibility that after the Restoration two, or perhaps three, of the participants in this story ("Master" Bacon, Grimston, and very improbably J. S.) encountered each other again. In the case of le Roy versus Bacon (Mich. 16 Car. II BR) the latter was indicted (I quote Levinz 22 ) "for intending to murder the Master of the Rolls, and for offering 100 l. to J. S.. to do it and saying, that if he would not he would do it himself." Keble 23 gives the accomplice's name as Parry and agrees with Siderfin 24 and Levinz about the cause, that Grimston "on Misdemeanours in a Cause in Chancery referred to him, made an order which displeased the Defendant." The D.N.B. refers to this Bacon as Nathaniel. 25 It is clear, however, from Heathcote MSS November, 1664, p. 170 (News Letter) that this is an error: "Mr. Nicholas Bacon, a barrister of Grey's Inn, being found guilty of endeavouring the death of Sir Harbottle Grimston, Master of the Rolls, has been sentenced to 1,000 Marks fine, 3 months' imprisonment, and to make public acknowledgment of his offence at the Kings Bench Bar &amp; Chancery." And the Christian name is confirmed by an entry in Cal. St. Pa. Dom. Ch. II , 1667, vol. ii, p. 116, 23rd May: "Warrant for a grant to Sir John Denham, surveyor of works, and Thos. Killigrew, groom of the bedchamber, of a fine of 600 l. imposed on Nich. Bacon, of Gray's Inn, convicted four years ago for contriving the death of Sir Harbottle Grimstone, Master of the Rolls." Whether this Nicholas was the "Master Bacon" of the Thomason pamphlet, one cannot tell. There can however be little doubt that he was the writer of the letter to Grimston which in H.M.C. Report on the MSS of the Earl of Verulam at Gorhambury, 1906 is headed (p.95) "Anonymous letter to Sir Harbottle Grimston, Master of the Rolls", and which suggests an enmity of longer standing than the immediate issue; part of it runs:— I have a cause Depending in Chancery which has already beene branded with your notorious partiality, and by consequence I expect that at the hearing . . . . it will receive as palpable tokens of your injustice . . . . I have sent this as a monitor to forewarne you that you do mee justice at your peril, or expect Buckingham's fate, although I were never soe certaine of Felton's end, for I shall thinke myselfe happy enough that I liv'd to punish audacious injustice, especially when it shrouds itselfe under robes of justice and power . . . . Sir, believe mee neither foole, mad man nor huff, for if the case would beare it, that I could tell you my name, you would know that I both dare and will doe as I say. The attempt and not the deed confounded Bacon. Grimston continued to wear the "robes of justice and power" until 1685, when Cooke's letter in the Lefroy Papers informs us, under 2nd January, that "the Old Master of the Rolls, Sir Harbottle Grimston, hath made shift to die at last from apoplexy." Note: The records of the Stationers' and Newspaper Makers' Company were made accessible to me by courtesy of the Clerk, Mr. R. T. Rivington, which I acknowledge with thanks. I am also indebted, initially, to Mr. J. Crow; and subsequently to Mr. Cyprian Bladgen, who from his great knowledge of the Company's history has generously given information and advice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Sir George Croke was a Judge under Elizabeth, James I, and Charles I. 2 Clearly an error for 1656. 3 Possibly a mistake for Edward Bulstrode, uncle of Bulstrode Whitlock, who is stated in Fuller's Worthies , 1662, (Bucks. p.133) to have been "his Highness Justice in North Wales" and to have "written a book of divers Resolutions and Judgements, with the reasons and causes thereof, given in the Court of Kings-Bench in the reigns of King James and King Charles, and is lately deceased." Bulstrode Whitlock was Sir George Crook's nephew and executor and was born in his house. In his Memorials (25 June 1657) is the single entry "Sir Harbottle Grimston published the Reports of Judge Crook". 4 It is reprinted, but without illuminating comment, as Appendix XXIX to Sir A.

This little volume, rightly described by the printers as "Multum in Parvo", contains, apart from the abridged Reports themselves and the indexes, nothing except a foreword which, after telling the reader "I here present you with a Scheme of a large volume, a Map of a World of Law" goes on to eulogise Crook, concluding, enigmatically, "For his book, besides the testimony [not reprinted] of all our Judges, the authority of its matter, and his name, which Providence hath so protected, as on which none of these abortive works were ever patronised, may highly induce you to the reading, which much imports the improvements of your knowledge in the Laws.

It was, he says, "the most ingeniously contrived little pile" he had seen; he adds that Grimston sold it for a ridiculous figure to two carpenters "of which they made eight hundred poundes", and provides also the information that "This October, 1681, it rang all over St. Albans that Sir Harebotle Grimston, Master of the Rolles, had removed the coffin of this most renowned Lord Chancellor (Francis Bacon) to make roome for his owne to lye-in in the vault there at St. Michael's Church". 10 Dugdale was left with the credit (which he assumed only reluctantly) of the immense production, but also with the total cost of its printing, which was a harassing burden. It may be significant that, on 3 September, 1655, Hodgkinson was granted by the Stationers a loan of £100 for three years. 11 It is stated by Plomer ( Dictionary of Booksellers and Printers, 1641-1660 ) that T. Warren "was succeeded by his widow Alice in 1661". There is an entry to her in the Stationers' Register under 21 May 1661. But he is almost certainly the "Mr. Warren" whom Smyth ( Obituaries ) mentions as having died on 14 April 1659, for Wing's first entry to Alice Warren is dated 1660 ( Index to Wing, 1956). She was the widow of John Norton, whose yeomanry part Warren was elected to receive soon after marrying her (24 August 1642). 12 It will be remembered that Grimston was a Commissioner in 1648. 13 He was presumably a connection by second marriage of Grimston. 14 It is difficult to see how the Judges can have failed to consider this point before giving their decision. 15 Such Orders (usually following from a petition) were, however, recognized procedure; and the Commons in this instance were endorsing the Judges' previous ruling. 16 The Parliamentary records of petitions for this year have been destroyed. 17 The Second Part of the Reports of Sir George Croke . . . .

      <field name="heading_text">Deception Compounded: Further Problems in Seventeenth-Century Irish Printing by John Alden</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If earlier pages of Studies in Bibliography 1 suggested that, in Irish printing of the seventeenth century, nothing need necessarily be what it seems, the fact perhaps reveals a fundamental and characteristic trait in Irish life, as true of its politics and its Church as of its bibliography. 2 While the essay in question stressed the existence of false places of publication in Irishprinted books, it now appears that on occasion even imprint dates may also be misleading. Of the numerous political events which harrowed Ireland in the seventeenth century the Cromwellian Settlement is one of the most significant. 3 On the return to England of Charles II one of his first steps was the restoration to his dispossessed Irish supporters of their lands, promulgated in a Gracious Declaration for the Settlement of . . . Ireland . After having been detained in England by the marriage of Charles II to Catherine of Braganza, the Duke of Ormonde in turn lost no time when he arrived in Dublin as Lord Lieutenant in giving the Royal Assent to the Act of Settlement passed in 1662 by the Irish Parliament to implement the principles set forth by Charles. That the Act resulted in numerous inequities and much confusion will not surprise the reader of J. P. Prendergast's Ireland from the Restoration to the Revolution (1887), and, almost inevitably, it was necessary in 1665 to pass a further Act for the Explaining of some Doubts amending the Act of Settlement of 1662. By means of these two Acts, in Brian FitzGerald's words, "Amidst confusion and heartburning, the ownership of the land of Ireland became once more determined. And . . . this time the settlement endured. It was to maintain the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy for the next two hundred and fifty years". 4 As historical documents the two Acts in their published form will be recognized for their vital importance. 5 But, being Irish in origin, the two items may be confidently counted on to offer complications. Bibliographically this they indeed do. For of the 1662 Act of Settlement there prove to be two distinct settings of type, distinguished in the Bradshaw Catalogue in terms of the type ornaments which border the title page: in one (Bradshaw 58), the ornaments consist of double rosettes (as in a horizontal S), while in the other (Bradshaw 59) they comprise fleurs-de-lis. No explanation of the relation of the two appears however ever to have been advanced. As a matter of fact, such an explanation is not far to seek. It is hinted at in a variant copy of the two Acts in the British Museum which has not hitherto been seriously considered. The copy in question combines the fleur-de-lis edition of the 1662 Act of Settlement with a copy of the 1665 Act of Explanation. In the latter the half-title and the title page have been cancelled, while on p. 3 the woodcut headpiece and caption ("An° Regni Caroli . . . His Majesties reign", a total of 14 lines) have been removed from the forme. In this guise the two acts appear as a bibliographical unit. This unity has further meaning for us, when one observes that the title border of the 1665 Act of Settlement also consists of fleurs-de-lis. That what has happened is patently this: With the promulgation of the 1665 Act of Explanation, further copies of the original Act of Settlement were required for point of reference. The supply being either exhausted or at least insufficient, it was necessary to print a new edition, and in doing so the typographic style and ornamentation of the 1665 Act of Explanation itself were followed. Possibly for legalistic reasons the original 1662 imprint date was retained. But it now appears that the imprint of the edition of the Act of Settlement with fleur-de-lis border should read, bibliographically speaking: Dublin, Printed by John Crook, Printer to the Kings Most Excellent Majesty, 1662 [i. e., 1665?]. 6 If in the writer's "Deception in Dublin" emphasis was laid on false imprints, it is equally true that the matter was not exhausted. As a case in point, the Trinity College, Cambridge, Library possesses an edition of A Proclamation concerning A Cessation of Arms with the imprint "Printed at Dublin, by William Bladen, printer to the Kings most Excellent Majestie, Anno Dom. 1643", which collates: 1 leaf, 17 pp. (A-B 4 C 2 ). On p. 1 appears a factotum block, and on p. 16 are used a number of open-face acorn ornaments. Neither is found, however, in other Bladen publications of the period, and the Dublin origin of the pamphlet is open to suspicion. Of this Proclamation and related documents, the result of negotiations between the Duke of Ormonde, representing the government of Charles I, and the Supreme Council of Confederate Catholics at Kilkenny there are numerous editions in various forms. There is, for instance, a broadside declaration of the Confederate Catholics printed at Waterford in 1643, described by Robert Steele in his Tudor and Stuart Proclamations (Ir 390), and entered by Wing apparently twice, as I 354 and again as I 394. There is also a pamphlet edition of the larger work with Bladen's imprint as given above, collating this time: 1 leaf, 17 ( i. e. , 18) pp. (A-B 4 C 2 ), with p. 18 misnumbered 17, and, on p. 1, Steele's arms no. 172. This edition appears to be that described by Wing as C2559, under Charles I; and again, under Ireland, as I 604. A similar pamphlet edition has the imprint "Imprinted at Dublin, By William Bladen, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majesty, Anno Dom. 1643", collating: 1 leaf, 18 pp. (A-C 4 , with A1 and C4 blank), of which p. 1 is misnumbered 2. It too contains Steele's arms no. 172. This edition seems not to be in Wing at all. And finally there is a London edition with the imprint "Dublin, by William Bladen; reprinted at London for Edw. Husbands, October 21. 1643". On this edition Wing lavishes three locations, with varying degrees of accuracy in his descriptions: under Charles I, as C2560; under Ireland, as I 605; and under Ormonde, as O 457. Oddly enough, it is this London edition which provides the clue to the probable identity of our mysterious edition. For on the very title page of the Husbands' edition are the open-face acorns which aroused our earlier suspicions. What printer worked for Husbands at this period? He is named in the imprint of a June 23, 1643, edition of Two Letters from His Excellencie Robert Earl of Essex as John Field. An examination of various works printed in Field's shop reveals that it possessed both the acorns and the factotum block of our curious "Dublin" edition. That this last was a piracy perpetrated in Field's shop seems likely, a quite unauthorized edition in the face of Husbands' commission by Parliament (cited on the title page) plausian entry in the Stationers' Register in Husbands' name. No less than plausible is the theory that Field on receiving a copy of the Dublin edition from which to set up an edition for Husbands chose to pirate an edition, rather closer in appearance typographically to the Dublin original than Husbands'. The fact that Husbands was a political appointee as publisher for the Roundhead Parliament, a sort of intruder in the printing trade, may have done much to assuage any moral scruples which Field had. The really frightening question is to what degree Field or others may have engaged in this practice at Husbands' expense. For it becomes increasingly likely that the suspicious Declaration of the Commons with the imprint "London, printed for Edward Husband Feb. 16, 1647. Reprinted at Kilkenny in the yeare 1648" is a comparable example of a similar practice. 7 Is it now going to be necessary to re-examine the hundreds of works printed for Husbands during the period of the Commonwealth for further instances of piracy, relevant not only to Irish books but to English works as well?</field>

And in August, 1955, it was the teetotal Archbishop of Dublin who settled a crippling barmen's strike there after all other means of mediation had failed. 3 But let us not be sentimental about the banishment to Connacht of Irishmen displaced by Cromwell. Those concerned were largely Norman-Irish land-owners or Irish earlier amenable to England, not the "mere Irish" who remained and worked the land the ownership of which alone changed hands. 4 Brian FitzGerald, The Anglo-Irish [1952], p. 186.

      <field name="heading_text">John Newbury, Projector of the Universal Chronicle : A Study of the Advertisements by Gwin J. Kolb</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Beginning with Sir John Hawkins, almost every writer 1 who has commented on the matter has declared that John Newbery, the bustling "philanthropic bookseller" of The Vicar of Wakefield and one of the best known publishers of the eighteenth century, was the projector of the Universal Chronicle —a shortlived (1758-1760) 2 paper remembered now largely because Dr. Johnson's Idler (and other pieces) 3 first appeared in it. Yet no evidence has been published 4 to support Hawkins's assertion, and one modern scholar has ventured the opinion that Hawkins "confused" the Universal Chronicle with Lloyd's Evening Post, and British Chronicle , of which "Newbery was one of the projectors." 4a The Bodleian Library contains a complete, and the British Museum a virtually complete (only one number—65—is missing), set of the Universal Chronicle ; and a study of the advertisements appearing in the paper yields interesting evidence, I think, on the question of Newbery's connection with it for at least the longer part of its life. Before presenting the results of such an examination, however, it may be relevant to note the principal events in the paper's history. The Chronicle ran for 105, eight-page numbers—from Saturday, April 8, 1758 to Saturday, March 29-Saturday, April 5 1760. Nos. 1-4 were entitled The Universal Chronicle, or Weekly Gazette and were "Printed for J. Payne , in Pater-noster-Row "; Nos. 5-39 were entitled Payne's Universal Chronicle, or Weekly Gazette . A note at the bottom of the first page of No. 39 stated that "This Paper, for the future, will be published by Mr. STEVENS, next Door to the Chapter Coffee-house , in Pater-noster-Row "; and beginning with No. 40 and extending through No. 91, the paper's name reverted to the original Universal Chronicle , etc., and "Printed for J. Payne ," etc. was altered to "Printed for R. Stevens , at Pope's -Saturday, April 8, 1758 to Saturday, March 29-Saturday, April 5, 1760. Nos. 92-105 were entitled The Universal Chronicle, and Westminster Journal ; Nos. 92-101 were "Printed for W. Faden, in Wine-Office-Court, Fleetstreet ; and R. Stevens," etc.; Nos. 102-05 were printed for R. Stevens only. The first 29 numbers of the Chronicle contain only one small advertisement, although the colophon of Nos. 2-29 informed the reader that "Advertisements . . are taken in" at " Pater-noster-Row " and although the " Proprietor (s)" announced in No. 29 that " As this Paper is now so well established as to exceed the . . . most sanguine Expectations. . . . We intend, for the future, to insert Advertisements, but such Advertisements only will be admitted as are perfectly decent, and intended to promote Trade, or that are otherwise serivceable to the Publick ." Of the remaining 76 numbers, 58 contain a total of 150 advertisements; 18 5 do not contain any. The 150 advertisements, a majority of which appear in Nos. 30-98, may be divided into two groups, [1] those (93) dealing with printed matter—mostly books—and [2] those (57) concerned with miscellaneous objects—principally patent medicines—and services. Fifty-four advertisements in the first group bear the name of " J. Newbery " and another four announce the publication of Newbery's Public Ledger ; ten more bear the name of " T. Carnan ," "believed to have been" Newbery's stepson, who "was intimately associated with him in his business"; 6 the remaining twenty-five belong to various other publishers, including J. Payne. Thirty-nine advertisements in the second group extol the virtues of "Dr. James's Powder," "sold only by J. Newbery," and of Thomas Greenough's "tincture," sold both by the "patentee" and by J. Newbery; most of the other eighteen are divided between announcements of the sale of linens, dress materials, etc. and a public notice regarding the " King's Packet-Boats ." To sum up, John Newbery is clearly associated with ninety-seven of the 150 advertisements, T. Carnan with another ten, making a total of 107, a number more than twice that of all other advertisements in the Chronicle . Different kinds of analyses reveal similar disproportions between Newbery and non-Newbery advertisements. Twenty-seven numbers of the Chronicle contain Newbery's, and only Newbery's, announcements about printed matter, whereas five numbers contain only advertisements by "outsiders." Nineteen numbers contain only advertisements of Dr. James's Powder and Greenough's tincture, whereas thirteen contain only announcements concerning other miscellaneous things. Of the ten books (or groups of books) advertised most frequently, eight are Newbery publications and another is T. Carnan's Nonpareil . Finally, two specific advertisements should be offered as evidence on the problem of Newbery's connection with the Chronicle . In No. 93 (for January 5-12, 1760) of the paper appears an announcement 7 of the publication of the first number of Newbery's Public Ledger ; in Nos. 96, 97, and 98 is reprinted the sizable preliminary address "to the public" which was published in No. 1 of the Ledger . An extensive, but not, of course, exhaustive, search has failed to turn up either the announcement of the initial publication of the Ledger or the preliminary address in any other newspaper. 8 These facts speak for themselves. It is hardly credible that Newbery, an eminently successful bookseller, should have placed two-thirds of the total number of advertisements in a paper in which he had no financial interest and which, by all available signs, was scarcely flourishing and may well have been struggling; it seems highly probable, on the other hand, that he was one, perhaps even the principal, proprietor of the Chronicle at least during its life from No. 30 through No. 105, and that he used its pages as a medium for advertising his other wares.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Dr. Johnson and the Public Ledger : A Small Addition to the Canon by Gwin J. Kolb</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In an article published a number of years ago, 1 Professor E. L. McAdam, Jr. demonstrated Dr. Johnson's authorship of the three "Weekly Correspondent" essays in the Public Ledger for December 2, 9, and 16, 1760, and suggested at the same time that Johnson "corrected and revised, if he did not write, the preliminary address to the public" (p. 204) which was printed in the first number (January 12, 1760) of the paper. Although to my knowledge no one has previously noted the fact, a much shorter notice regarding the Ledger appeared in the Universal Chronicle, and Westminster Journal 2 for January 5-12, 1760 (No. 93); and I believe, largely but not solely on the basis of similarities in thought and style, that Johnson was also the author of this piece. Since files of the Universal Chronicle are very rare, 3 and since knowledge of the context is necessary to a full understanding of the part I attribute to Johnson, I include herewith the complete text of the advertisement in which the three, one-sentence paragraphs appear. This Day is published And delivered Gratis , Number I, of a New Paper, entitled, The PUBLIC LEDGER, or Daily Register of Commerce and Intelligence; Containing a judicious and accurate Arrangement of the most Early and Authentic News, besides many other Articles that are very essential, and even of great Importance to all those who are engaged in Trade and Commerce, or otherwise interested in Public Affairs, either Political or Literary. Printed for W. Bristow , Publisher, next the great Toy-Shop, in St. Paul's Church Yard, London . To the PUBLIC. Though what is already said may be sufficient to explain so much of our Scheme as is at present necessary to be known, yet Custom has established a kind of Law, that he who sollicits the public Favour should lay before the Public his Pretensions, that they may know on what Terms they are to receive him into their Service; and the Pretensions and Promises made on these Occasions have often been so complex or extensive, as not to be fulfilled even with the utmost Skill and Assiduity. This perhaps may be suspected of the Paper here proposed; for the Public has a Right to suspect, and to be satisfied; but the Projectors have also a Right to propose, and to be heard: Where the Benefit is reciprocal, and a Man serves others with an equal Advantage to himself, the Obligation is equal; but if he conveys more Benefit than he receives, he has Merit to plead in his Favour, and is not only entitled to Attention, but to Encouragement. This Attention the Proprietors of the above Paper claim, and some Encouragement they hope for; as their Scheme, they apprehend, is not only new, but of a Nature more generally useful to Mankind than any Publication which has hitherto been offered: For a particular Explanation of it, however, they refer the Reader to the first Paper, which will be delivered Gratis at the Place above-mentioned. External evidence supporting the attribution consists, briefly, of (1) the fact that a short time before January, 1760 Johnson had written a similar, one-paragraph notice "To the Public" in the advertisement (October 3, 1759) for John Newbery's World Displayed as well as the introduction (December 1, 1759) to that work; 4 and (2) the assumption that, as most writers have declared and as an examination of the advertisements suggests, 5 Newbery, the publisher of the Public Ledger , was also one of the proprietors of the Universal Chronicle , in which both the Idler and other pieces by Johnson were printed. 6 No. 92 of the Idler , for instance, appeared in the same number of the Chronicle as that in which the notice I attribute to Johnson was published. Turning to the notice itself, I believe I detect in each of the sentences the genuine Johnsonian hallmark. Specifically, it is difficult to believe that Johnson did not write "for the Public has a Right to suspect, and to be satisfied; but the Projectors have also a Right to propose, and to be heard"; "if he conveys more Benefit than he receives, he has Merit to plead in his Favour, and is not only entitled to Attention, but to Encouragement"; and "as their Scheme, they apprehend, is not only new, but of a Nature more generally useful to Mankind than any Publication which has hitherto been offered." Moreover, the striking resemblances between parts of the notice (especially the first half of the first sentence) and passages in several other pieces by Johnson, both earlier and later than 1760, afford fairly solid evidence, I think, for giving the notice a small place in the Johnsonian canon. For example, in the Introduction to the Harleian Miscellany (1744), Johnson began, " Though the Scheme . . . is so obvious, that the Title alone is sufficient to explain it . . . ." In the Proposals for the Publisher (1744), he wrote, "Such is the Design which the Publick is now solicited to favour ." In the Rambler , No. 1 (1750), he remarked, "If a man could glide imperceptibly into the favour of the public and only proclaim his pretensions . . . when he is sure of not being rejected"; and in the Rambler , No. 40 (1750) he used the phrase " skill and assiduity ." In the Preface to the Catalogue of the Society of Artists (1762), he declared, "The public may justly require to be inform'd of the nature and extent of every design, for which the favour of the public is openly solicited ." And in the address "To the Public" concerning the Literary Magazine (1756), he wrote, in the closest parallel I have found, "There are some Practices which custom and prejudice have so unhappily influenced, that to observe or neglect them is equally censurable. The promises made by the Undertakers of any new Design, every Man thinks himself at liberty to deride, and yet every Man expects, and expects with reason, that he who solicits the Public Attention should give some account of his pretensions ." 7 Finally, in spite of the caveat about deducing the authorship of a given piece from another work whose attribution is itself uncertain, it can still be pointed out that (1) the explicit reference at the end of the notice to the "particular Explanation" which Mr. McAdam attributes (rightly, I think), in whole or part, to Johnson, provides at least slight evidence for Johnson's authorship of the notice; that (2) the concluding words of the "preliminary address"—"a clear Title to the Favour and Esteem of the Public , which is what we are most sollicitous to deserve" 8 —are somewhat similar to the opening of the first sentence in the notice; and that (3) the text of the "preliminary address" itself appeared in the three numbers of the Chronicle for January 26-February 2, February 2-9, and February 9-16, 1760. 9 On the other hand, of course, acceptance of the attribution of the notice lends additional weight to Mr. McAdam's suggestion regarding the authorship of the "preliminary address."</field>

F. Powell (Boswell's Life [1934-50], I, 546) and Professor Hazen (p. 217), seems to me to be written in characteristic Johnsonian style; I am particularly impressed by "has hitherto been," a phrase which Johnson used repeatedly in one form or another, and by the parallelism of "so cheap" and "so commodious," especially when separated by the "or." Cf., also, "than any Publication which has hitherto been offered" in the text of the notice reprinted above. 5 See my article cited in n. 2 above. 6 Hazen, pp. 205-209; Boylston Green, "Possible Additions to the Johnson Canon," Yale University Library Gazette , XVI (1942), 70-79.

      <field name="heading_text">The First Edition of Goldsmith's Bee , No. I by Arthur Friedman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a paper published in 1944 Mr. Douglas Knight announced the discovery, in a full set of unbound numbers of Goldsmith's Bee at Yale, of an unnoticed edition of No. I, with numerous differences from the edition in all bound sets he had seen or found described. 1 The two editions of No. I may be easily distinguished by their press figures. A.: 2-4, 13-1, 20-4, 27-3 B. (the edition described by Mr. Knight): 2-2, 31-1 Mr. Knight argued for the priority of B. chiefly on the basis of the less satisfactory punctuation in A., which he thought might be expected in a hasty reprint. In a brief comment on his paper at the time, I suggested that a better argument for the priority of B. could be found in its supposed rarity: if A. was the first edition and there were enough copies of it on hand to complete all or most sets when the weekly numbers were collected for re-issue, then it would not be possible to find a good reason why B. should have been printed at all; if, however, B. was the first edition, it would be easy to suggest plausible reasons why it might have been wholly or largely exhausted before the parts were collected. 2 This argument for the priority of B. appeared to me conclusive; but when I came to examine the texts of the two editions, I found differences that from my experience with other Goldsmith texts I could account for only if A. were the first edition and B. the reprint. I consequently made a census of readily available copies of the Bee and found that the B. edition is by no means excessively rare. In thirteen bound sets that I have seen or that have been described for me, No. I is in the A. edition in seven and in the B. edition in six. 3 Since my original argument thus loses all its force, I wish now to present the evidence that led me to question it. As Mr. Knight has noticed, the chief textual differences in the two editions occur in the punctuation: "In every case the alteration makes the sense less clear [in A. than in B.], and in some places quite confuses it." There are two places where the punctuation is clearly in error in A. but correct in B. (Mr. Knight quotes one example from pages 18-19, and there is another on page 29); and according to the principle of textual degeneration in reprints, this evidence would point to B. as the first edition. 4 But though experience has shown this principle to be sound for works of an earlier period, I doubt that it can be safely applied to printing of the third quarter of the eighteenth century. My observation is that compositors of authorized reprints in this period were remarkably accurate: they usually corrected at least as many obvious misprints as they made, and they introduced on an average—according to my experience with editions not revised by the author—only one substantive change every five or ten or even twenty pages. If great textual degeneration appears in a reprint in Goldsmith's day, one may well suspect a piracy. Some compositors of authorized reprints of the period were also very faithful to the punctuation of their copy, but many—probably most—compositors felt free to make what changes they thought desirable in the punctuation. And from collating thousands of pages of Goldsmith's writings, in periodicals and books printed for a variety of booksellers and in editions revised and unrevised by the author, I have found a consistent direction in these changes when they occur with at least a fair degree of frequency: in reprints the punctuation becomes heavier and more regular . In the first printings of Goldsmith's writings the punctuation tends to be fairly light and somewhat irregular or inconsistent. In most first reprints commas and sometimes other marks of punctuation are added, and commas may be changed to semicolons, semicolons to colons, and periods to marks of exclamation or interrogation; 5 punctuation tends to be omitted or lightened only to produce greater regularity. These same changes may occur, though usually with decreasing frequency, in succeeding reprints. 6 When this rule for identifying reprints is applied to No. I of the Bee , A. appears clearly as the first edition and B. as the reprint. In twelve places where there is no punctuation in A. there are commas in B., and in most of these places the punctuation thus appears more regular in B.: for example, where A. reads, "The sagacity of the physician, by this means soon discovered the cause of their patient's disorder; and Alcander being apprized of their discovery, at length extorted a confession from the reluctant dying lover" (p. 17), B. has commas after "means" and "Alcander." Again, in one place where there is no punctuation in A. there is a semicolon in B., and in four places where there are periods in A. there are exclamation marks in B. In all, then, the punctuation is heavier in B. than in A. in seventeen instances. 7 On the other hand, there are only four instances in which the punctuation is heavier in A. than in B.: in three there are commas in A. where there is no punctuation in B., and in one there is a semicolon in A. where there is a comma in B. In three of these four instances the punctuation again appears to be more regular in B.: where A. reads, ". . . there is hardly a character in comedy to which a player of any real humour, might not add strokes of vivacity" (p. 12), B. omits the comma; where A. reads, ". . . the imperious tone, menaces, and blows at once changed their sensations and their ideas: their ears, and their shoulders taught their souls to shrink back into servitude" (p. 29), B. omits the comma after "ears"; where A. reads, "Thus lowering with resolution; he was dragged . . . before the tribunal" (p. 20), B. has a comma for the semicolon. This test seems to me to establish the priority of A., and my conclusion is supported or at least not weakened by other textual and bibliographical evidence. Substantive changes . There are only two substantive changes between A. and B. A. reads (with a correction of punctuation): ". . . every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil" (p. 19); the "a" is omitted in B. Here the readings seem equally satisfactory. The other change, however, would seem more important. A reads: "The French player . . . begins to shew away by talking nonsense, which he would have thought latin by those whom he knows do not understand a syllable of the matter" (p. 12); for "whom" B. reads "who". Since "who" would probably have been considered preferable by eighteenth-century standards, and since Goldsmith seems to have paid some attention to the distinction between "who" and "whom," it might seem probable that the B. reading was Goldsmith's and the A. reading was introduced by the compositor in a reprint. A parallel example, however, suggests that it is equally plausible that Goldsmith wrote "whom" and that the compositor of B. was responsible for the "correction." In the Preface written for Essays by Mr. Goldsmith (1765), Goldsmith says: "I would desire in this case, to imitate that fat man who I have somewhere heard of in a shipwreck"; and in revising this sentence for the second edition (1766) he left the "who" unchanged. But in a 1765 reprint of the Essays , which there is no reason to think that Goldsmith revised and which is in all probability a piracy, 8 the "who" is changed to "whom". Copy for reprinting . It seems that Goldsmith would have been somewhat more likely to preserve for his own use copies of the first edition of No. I than copies of the reprint. In reprinting two essays from No. I in Essays by Mr. Goldsmith , he used edition A. as copy. Factotum . When a work forming part of a series exists in two editions, the edition resembling other members of the series is probably the first edition. Edition A. of No. I and Nos. II-VIII all use the same factotum; Edition B. of No. I uses a different factotum. This argument loses some of its force, however, from the fact that the collected issue of the Bee was published only three weeks after the appearance of No. VIII. Thus if the reprint of No. I was made for the collection, it could be considered not an exception to but the last member of the series and would be about as likely to resemble the rest of the series as would the first member. Press work . If the Bee is thus thought of as a series of nine parts of which the first edition of No. I is the first part and the reprint of No. I the last, then we would expect the press work of the first edition to resemble that of the early part of the series, while the press work of the reprint would be more likely to resemble that of the latter part. The early part of the series, starting with No. II and continuing through the first gathering of No. V, shows almost perfect uniformity in the press work: with only one exception, 9 each gathering has two press figures, and consequently one pressman must have printed on white paper and another pressman perfected each sheet, no doubt on a second press. Clearly edition A. of No. I corresponds to this part of the series, for it too has two press figures in each gathering. The latter part of the series shows less regularity in press figures: the second gathering of No. V has none; No. VI has one in each gathering; No. VII has two in the first gathering and none in the second; No. VIII has one in each gathering. The B. edition of No. I, with one press figure in each gathering, appears to correspond in its press work to Nos. VI and VIII, where presumably one pressman worked off both formes of a sheet on a single press. Wrappers . The original weekly numbers of the Bee were sold, according to the advertisements, "stitched in blue Covers." Thus some copies of the first edition of No. I had wrappers, while it is doubtful that any copies of the reprint did; and if a copy could be found in the original wrappers, there is a fair presumption that it would belong to the first edition. The unbound numbers at Yale do not have wrappers, but Mr. Knight believes that they once had: "Although the wrappers have been lost, holes for the six original stitches can still be seen." It seems more probable, however, that the holes were made when the numbers were sewn for binding, for Mr. Herman Liebert informs me that in his opinion and that of other bibliographers at Yale the numbers there "have at one time been in, and have been very neatly removed from, some kind of binding."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 N&amp;Q , CLXXXVII, 276. 2 PQ , XXIV (1945), 143. 3 Copies with No. I in edition A.: BM, CSmH, ICN, ICU, MH, Professor Chauncey B. Tinker, Friedman.

Two of these copies are Lane's re-issue. I am grateful to Mr. Carey S. Bliss, Mr. Herman Liebert, and Mr. William B. Todd for their reports on copies. 4 This is not quite Mr. Knight's argument: "We should expect such mistakes to be fewer in the later of the two issues, if there were a valid re-issuing of the work which would pay the publisher to make it more correct. But if he needed it for a limited purpose, and in a hurry, some compositor would have the responsibility of duplicating the earlier text." It is hard to see that haste would be involved here: three weeks elapsed between the appearance of the last weekly number on 24 November 1759 and the publication of the collected issue on 15 December; and it now appears that Wilkie must have had enough copies of the first edition of No. I, whether A. or B., to complete sets for which there was any prospect of an immediate sale. 5 Compositors, however, seem not to have felt free to change other marks to periods; at least I have almost never found this change in editions not revised by the author. 6 Other signs of a reprint in Goldsmith's day are the expansion of contractions such as "I'm," "don't," and "tho'" and the change of "'d" endings in prose to "ed." 7 I do not include in my figures here the two instances mentioned earlier where the punctuation is incorrect in A. and correct in B., for the only differences are in the position of the punctuation. 8 Studies in Bibliography , V (1952), 190-93. 9 The second gathering of No. II, which has only one press figure.

      <field name="heading_text">Prologue to Copyright in America: 1772 by Rollo G. Silver</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Five years after the colonies declared their independence, the Connecticut Assembly passed the first copyright legislation—an act granting Andrew Law protection in the publication of his Collection of the Best Tunes for the Promotion of Psalmody . Two years later, as a result of John Ledyard's petition for the protection of his account of Captain James Cook's last voyage, the Connecticut Assembly passed the first general copyright act, the text of which was based upon the English "Act for the Encouragement of Learning." Soon after Connecticut, other states passed similar laws and by 1786 twelve states had given protection to their authors. It would seem, therefore, that the American author awaited freedom from English rule before pressing for protective legislation. Although this may be considered true for the great majority of American writers, there is at least one instance of an attempt to secure copyright before the Revolution. In 1770, William Billings, of Boston, published his New-England Psalm-Singer , a book of tunes which he composed during his years as singing teacher and choir master. It was evidently a popular work, for Billings immediately started to prepare a second volume. While engaged in this enterprise, he probably feared the prospect of a pirated edition. At any rate, he decided to address a petition for protection to the House of Representatives, then in session at Harvard College. The petition has been lost, but it was duly recorded on November 7, 1770: A Petition of William Billings , praying that he may have the exclusive Privilege of selling a Book of Church-Musick, compos'd by himself, for a certain Term of Years. Read and committed to Mr. Gardner of Stow , Col. Prescott and Capt. Dix . 1 On November 13, 1770: The Committee on the Petition of William Billings , reported. Ordered , That the Petitioner have Leave to bring in a Bill for the Purpose of his Petition. 2 Encouraged by this, Billings lost no time in preparing a bill. It was brought before the House on November 16, 1770: A Bill for granting to William Billings the sole Privilege of Printing and Vending a Work of his own Composition, consisting of Tunes and Anthems suitable to be used in Religious Assemblies . Read the first and second Time. Ordered , That the further Consideration of this Bill be referred to the next Session. 3 Although the House postponed the decision, it did not do so because of any doubt concerning the principle of granting copyright. The reason for the delay is stated in Billings' next petition, now printed from the manuscript: Province of y e Mass: tts Bay To his Excellency Thomas Hutchinson Esq: Cap t . Gen: &amp;c the Honorable his Majesty's Council &amp; y e hon: ble House of Representatives of said Province in Gen: Court assembled. May y e 27: th 1772 The Memorial of Will: m Billings, &amp;c. Whereas your Memorialist in the Year 1770 prefer'd his Petition to this Hon: ble Court, therein praying for the Reasons therein mention'd, that he might have a Patent granted him for the sole Liberty of printing a Book, by him compos'd, consisting of Psalm Tunes, Anthems &amp; Canons, which has been found upon Experience, to be to general Acceptance; &amp; which Composition is made much Use of in many of our Churches, &amp; is more &amp; more used every Day. That your Memorialist has compos'd a 2: d Vol: in Addition, to make his Performance more compleat, tho' he is not insensible, that further Additions may be made.—He would also inform this Hon: bl Court that he is apprehensive that an unfair Advantage is about to be taken against him, &amp; that others are endeavoring to reap the Fruits of his great Labor &amp; Cost.—That this hon: bl Court so far countenanc'd &amp; sustain'd his Petition, as to commit the same, &amp; that your Committee reported in favor of your Petitioner; but it being suggested by a worthy Member of this hon: ble Court, that they should be certain that your Petitioner was the real Author of the Book, whereupon the Consideration thereof was refer'd to the next Session. In answer to which your Memorialist avers that he is the sole Author, &amp; should have been asham'd, to have expos'd himself, by publishing any Tunes, Anthems, or Canons, compos'd by Another; however fully to satisfy this hon: ble Court, your Memorialist stands very ready to be examin'd by any Committee, or the whole General Assembly, if they think proper; tho' he doubts not, that at this Time of Day there are sundry Members of this hon: ble Court upon that Head fully satisfy'd; but so it is may it please your Excellency &amp; Honors, that your Memorialist's former Petition is (as he is inform'd) either lost or misplac'd; he therefore prays that the same may be reviv'd, &amp; that he may, by the Indulgence of this Hon: bl Court, be favor'd with the alone Privilege, of printing his own Composition for a number of Years, as to this Hon: ble Court shall seem meet, &amp; your Memorialist, as in Duty Bound, shall ever pray. W m Billings. 4 Thus it appears that, in 1770, the House would have been willing to pass the copyright bill if they had been certain that the work was original. When Billings' second petition was received on June 9, 1772, it was "Read and Ordered , That the Prayer be granted, and that the Petitioner have Leave to bring in a Bill." 5 Fortunately, the manuscript of the bill remains in the Massachusetts Archives : Anno Regni Regis Georgii tertii duodecimo An Act for Granting to William Billings of Boston the Sole privilege of printing and vending a Book by him Composed consisting of a Great variety of Psalm-tunes Anthems &amp; Canons in two Vol s . Whereas the s d . W m . Billings has compos'd a Great Number of psalm-tunes Anthems and Canons to which are much us'd in and esteemed by many of our Churches, and which are daily more and more us'd and adopted by a Great number of people—which Composition has cost him much pains and application and has also been very expensive to him;—And whereas the said William Billings has supplicated the aid of this Court in this his undertaking—in Order therefore to promote such a laudable performance Be it enacted by the Governour Council &amp; House of Representatives— That the said William Billings be and hereby is impower'd soley to print and vend his said Composition consisting of Psalm-tunes Anthems and Canons and have and recieve ( sic ) the whole and only benefit and emolument arising therefrom for and during the full term of seven [fourteen ( deleted )] years from the first Day of August next during which term all persons are hereby strictly prohibited either by himself or any by for or under him, from printing or vending his P.

Billings to and for his use in any Court of Record proper to try the same unless the Person or Persons so printing vending or bartering his said Composition shall be first impower'd by the said William Billings in writing under his hand &amp; seal. In the House of Representatives July. 14. 1772 Read a first second &amp; third time &amp; pass'd to be Engrossed Sent up for Concurrence T. Cushing Spkr In Council, July 14, 1772, Read a first &amp; second time &amp; passed a Concurrence, to be Engrossed Jn. Cotton D.Secry. 6 In reading the text of this bill, one cannot help wondering what motives prompted the change in the term of copyright. The English law, the Statute of Queen Anne, permitted a copyright of fourteen years for new books. And when, on May 2, 1783, the Colonial Congress recommended the passage of copyright laws by the several States, it suggested a term of not less than fourteen years. Perhaps the House of Representatives thought a term of seven years would appear to be a fair compromise. As the Speaker's endorsement shows, the bill was passed by the House on June 14, 1772. 7 The Council passed it, too, but Hutchinson refused to sign it. It was returned to the House along with other bills and the statement that "his Excellency had not given his Assent to the following Bills which had been laid before him." 8 Billings must have been discouraged, for his second book was not published until 1778. He had not obtained the copyright for his proposed two-volume work; but this episode is significant because a colonial legislative body had passed a bill for copyright, even though it was vetoed by the representative of the Crown.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Textual Variants in Sinclair Lewis's Babbitt by Matthew J. Bruccoli</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For students of modern bibliography Sinclair Lewis's Babbitt offers worthwhile evidence about textual variation, and its problems, in present day printing from plates. The facts of variation are in themselves of no particular literary significance (save that they occur); but the implications that can be drawn from a study of Babbitt 's printing history as revealed by these facts are of real moment to critics of contemporary texts and to scholars who must quote from texts produced by 20th-century printing shops. Of more specialized interest is the appearance of two bibliographical problems, for one of which, at least, no certain solution is available. The variants in question appear in a table at the end of this note. They were discovered by examining copies of different printings on the Hinman Collating Machine owned by the University of Virginia Library. 1 In all, five states of variation may be found between the original state of the plates and the state represented by current reprints in the Modern Library and Harbrace Modern Classics editions (both printed from the same plates). The first stage of correction occurs during the initial printing published on September 14, 1922, by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co. Here the substitution of Lyte for Purdy , and of any for my on page 49 is of some seriousness since the original reading had misnamed the character. The problem is in two parts, of course: (1) to determine whether the error was corrected by stop press or by cancellation within a single impression, or whether the error was confined to the whole first impression, and the corrected state of page 49 to a different impression of the book; and (2) who caught the error and when, and how it was corrected. Because stop-press alteration of plates is expensive in lost press-time when undertaken by modern printing establishments, absolutely attested cases have not, apparently, found their way into published bibliographical investigation. Hence one's first impulse might be to conjecture that there were two pre-publication printings of Babbitt and that the changes on page 49 were made between the two impressions. There were indeed two prepublication printings. The Harcourt, Brace records 2 show that the first printing bill for 80,500 copies of Babbitt was dated July 27, 1922; and the second press bill for 20,000 copies September 23, 1922. The first plate correction bill was September 23, 1922. Since publication date was September 14, it is clear that the second impression had been ordered before publication and may even have been run off the presses by that date although (see below) not released until October. However, this impression can be identified, and it is not the same as the impression in which the only variants are those on page 49, for in this second printing the Hinman Collator discloses some evidence of slight plate damage that would occur through storage of plates between impressions. Moreover, additional plate corrections were made, on pages 75, 85, and 271, not present in the various copies containing only the page 49 altered readings. Doubtless because the order for the second printing of 20,000 copies was placed before publication as a supplement to the original printing, no change from the first-impression date was made on the verso of the title-page for these copies; hence they can be distinguished from first-printing copies only by the presence of the corrected readings on pages 75, 85, and 271. However, on the title-page verso of the third impression this second printing is given belated recognition as Second Printing, October, 1922 , followed by the line Third Printing, October, 1922 . 3 To sum up. The publisher's records list between the first and third printings a second of 20,000 billed on September 23, 1922. By some slight plate damage and by alterations to the plates of pages 75, 85, and 271 (accounting for the September 23 bill for plate corrections) this impression differentiates itself from the impression with the original states of the plates and (on the evidence of the Hinman Collator in the lack of plate damage) from the same first impression though with the two alterations on page 49. This second printing is subsequently numerated on the title-page verso of the third and fourth impressions, although not on its own title-page verso. The Lyte-any variants on page 49, therefore, were not made in the interval between two impressions but instead are present within the original first impression. As to the exact circumstances of these page 49 alterations within the first printing we have no information and at this late date are unlikely to secure any. On some occasions a modern pressman at the start of printing will scan an early copy of a sheet for mechanical errors; but that such a workman would be so intimately concerned with the sense as to catch the mistake in a name, as here, is scarcely credible. It would be possible to conceive on other occasions that delay in the delivery of author's corrected proof for final revises, or some error in failing to make final corrections, might inadvertently extend even to the early stages of printing. No precise decision seems possible here, although conjecture may be allowed. It would seem most probable that by some accident, the details of which cannot be recovered, these two page 49 corrections ordered for the text in linotype form had not been made before casting of the plate; and the failure to correct was then discovering by comparison of such proof with the foundry proof (pulled from the plates) only after printing of the forme had started. We know that Lewis had partly relied upon the professional proofreaders in the Quinn &amp; Boden printing establishment. Hence, as an alternative theory we might guess that someone, perhaps interested in the story, took it upon himself to read the whole collection of foundry proofs and in this process came upon the page 49 errors. 4 Thus we are faced with the simple proposition, either (1) the case is one of stop-press correction, or (2) the case is one of sheet cancellation. That the Lyte-any sheets of the first printing represent completely reimposed and newly imprinted sheets at a later time is possible but not probable on the evidence. If a cancellans sheet had been manufactured before binding had started, the Purdy-my sheets would need to represent faulty copies which had been ordered destroyed but by some error found their way to the bindery along with corrected sheets. Such a theory cannot be maintained in view of the evidence that substantial numbers of the original state are in existence (6 of the original against 8 of the corrected in the 14 copies I have checked). As an alternative we should need to suppose that binding had started before the error was discovered and the cancellans sheets provided; in such a case the Purdy-my copies would represent copies initially bound before the cancellans sheets arrived. There is no positive evidence for this theory, and some rather slight evidence against it. In the first place, no records of a cancellans sheet exist. In the second, I am inclined to lean some weight on the fact that at the time the alterations were made in the original set of plates, a duplicate set of shells (unbacked plates) that had also been cast were similarly altered. The argument is not strong, but on the evidence that later plate alterations were not (except for two anomalous pages) simultaneously transferred to the shells, there may be reason to associate the page 49 corrections as near as possible to the original casting and checking of both original plate and shell, since changes made in the one seem to have been made simultaneously in the other. The odds are, therefore, that in the page 49 variants we have an example of comparatively rare modern stoppress correction. 5 In the unnumbered second printing (not distinguished from the first but subsequently listed as the second, and as distributed in October), the page 49 alterations are found, of course, and in addition errors on pages 75, 85, and 271 were corrected in the plates; and in the numbered third printing (October) a further necessary change was made, on page 397, from against the Open Shop to for the Open Shop . In large part as the result of Mr. Louis Feipel's suggestion, 6 twelve further corrections were made in the fourth printing distributed in November of the same year. This state of the plates also machined the Grosset &amp; Dunlap movie reprint edition of 1924. An immediate anomaly appears when the series of printings are collated as represented by the Harbrace Modern Classics, post-1942 cheap edition Grosset &amp; Dunlap editions, and the Modern Library reprints, for with the exception of the two corrections on page 49 stemming from the plate alteration to this single page during the first impression, and the variants on pages 188 and 196 first found in the fourth printing, the remaining fourteen alterations revert to their original faulty readings as present in the first-impression plates. Duplicate plates provide the explanation. The Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co. records show that on July 1, 1922, one set of plates and a duplicate set of shells (unbacked plates) were manufactured (information again by the courtesy of Mr. Gerald Gross). On December 20, 1941, the original set of plates was melted, and on January 7, 1942, the duplicates, or shells, were backed up to make them into printing plates. From this second set, therefore, were printed all the Harbrace Modern Classics and Modern Library editions. That page 49 in these duplicate plates appears in the corrected state is explicable in the normal course provided the stop-press alterations were made from foundry proof and thus in both sets at the same time, plates and shells. However, the seemingly arbitrary selection only of pages 188 and 196 to bring into conformity with the first-set alterations in the fourth impression is very puzzling. Both pages are in the outer forme of the same sheet, but the significance of this fact is difficult to apply. 7 From this history of the plates we learn that the Lewis who sneered at an English Rotarian for speaking of "Bertrand Shaw" was not himself so scrupulous as he might have been about the accuracy of his references to the fraternal organizations that he was satirizing. The B. in B. P. O. E. he twice expanded in error as Brotherly (pp. 9, 165, corrected in the fourth printing) although once correctly as Benevolent (p. 55). The forms Oddfellows (p. 203) and Redmen (p. 188 but correctly on p. 203) might seem as ignorant to members of these orders as "Bertrand" Shaw to a literary man. But the really interesting conclusion from this plate study, outside of the two bibliographical problems involved, is the evidence that in modern textual transmission one cannot necessarily trust the latest editions of plated books to be the most correct. Before the institution of the duplicate plates the history of Babbitt was one of steady improvement in the state of the text through the fourth printing, although no evidence is present to suggest authorial correction at any stage. But beginning with 1942 editions, the almost wholly uncorrected second set of plates reverted to a state of textual error that wiped out substantially all the results of the improvements in the second, third, and fourth impressions. As a result, the only reading texts now being printed are more corrupt than any impression after the original; and a textual critic of the future will need to search out either the fourth impression or some reprint before 1942 since only these represent the most highly corrected state of Babbitt 's readings. 8 Table September 1922.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The two variants on page 49 were first discovered by Mr. Jacob Blanck (see Sinclair Lewis: A Biographical Sketch by Carl van Doren, with a Bibliography by Harvey Taylor [1953], pp. 102-103; the rest, I believe, have not been recognized. I am grateful to Mr. John Wyllie, University of Virginia Librarian, for suggesting this study to me and for helping me to work out the evidence, and to Professor Fredson Bowers for assistance in the preparation of this account of my findings. 2 Teste Mr. Gerald Gross of Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., to whom I am particularly indebted for much valuable information. I am also grateful to Mr. James T. Quinn of Quinn &amp; Boden Co. (the original printers of the book), and to Mr. William Simon, Jr., of H. Wolff Co (printers of the Modern Library edition), for answering questions about the printing of Babbitt . 3 Extended search has failed to turn up any copy listing itself as the Second Printing on the title-page verso. It is not likely that one will be found since the time interval between this recorded second printing and the third printing is very likely too narrow for still another to exist. 4 The possibility that this stage of the plate alteration resulted from some error in the printing plant might be argued since it would seem that these particular plate alterations were never billed to Harcourt, Brace. 5 A collector concerned with 'points' will, of course, choose the Purdy-my state as the earlier. There is no validity whatever to the arguments of the bookseller Robert K. Black that since the Lyte-any readings are found in a copy autographed by Lewis on the day after publication (the copy is now in the University of Virginia Library), they must represent the state found in the author's advance copies and thus must be considered as "gathered and bound before any of the so-called 'first state' copies, so that in terms of priority of issue, though not of printing, it actually precedes them and is therefore more desirable" (see Mr. Black's List Number Forty-Five issued c. March 1956 from Upper Montclair, N.J.). In the first place, the copy cannot be proved to be from the advance copies sent Lewis. In the second place, the assumption that an author's advance copies represent the first copies off the binding machines is ordinarily wrong: it supposes that copies are shipped to the publisher in driblets from the bindery and that the publisher immediately breaks open a case and sends out the author's copies. In the third place, the order of pre-publication distribution of copies can have no bearing on questions of 'issue,' especially when mere press variants are involved. For a full discussion of this matter, see Bowers, Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), pp. 409-411. 6 Mr. Feipel, who makes a hobby of proofreading published books to note their errors and inconsistencies, wrote Harcourt, Brace on November 6, 1922, enclosing a list of over seventy readings that in his view required alteration for consistency of usage or because of real error. In response to the question whether the spelling areoplane on pp. 19 and 85 was intentional, Mr. Donald C. Brace of Harcourt, Brace, acknowledging on November 9 Mr. Feipel's list, replied that the spelling was intentional, and added, "It may interest you to know that it was an effort, each time the proof was read, to keep the proof reader from changing it." Lewis's response to the list was in character: "J. Henry! This man Feipel is a wonder — to catch all these after rather unusually careful proofreading not only by myself and my wife but also by two or three professionals at Quinn's! . . . (Gawd, Feipel has me nervous about hyphens!)" (Lewis to Donald Brace, November 10, 1922, quoted from Harrison Smith, ed., From Main Street to Stockholm [1952], pp. 113-114. The change from benny (i.e., overcoat) to kelly (i.e., hat) was suggested by Keith Preston in his column "Hit or Miss" in the Chicago Daily News for Nov. 4, 1922, on p.8, in connection with a note, signed 'XYLOID,' about the glossary in the British edition of Babbitt . 7 The Hinman Collator discloses that type wear on pp. 188 and 196 present in the fourth impression does not appear in the later printings that were made from the duplicate plates of these pages. Hence one is barred from conjecturing that for some reason the original plates for these pages were held over for use in later impressions: it is certain that pp. 188 and 196 were printed from the duplicate plates, which must therefore have been altered. But why other plates were not also altered at the same time to conform to the fourth-impression corrections cannot be explained. 8 As a pendant to this commentary on modern textual transmission, one might point out that the single really substantive alteration that corrects something not clearly a misprint (except for the Purdy-Lyte alteration) was in fact made on the suggestion of an outsider (i.e., kelly for benny on p. 121).</field>
