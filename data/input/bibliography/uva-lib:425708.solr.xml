      <field name="fulltext">I In recent years we have all come to recognize the need for what might be called 'scientific' investigation in bibliography, a phrase which at its best implies, as Professor Bowers has succinctly put it, a strict regard for certain fixed bounds of physical fact and logical probability. 1 The achievements resulting from such a concern are clear and important. In descriptive bibliography we have gained a new, accurate and rational vocabulary, and formulae that are both economic and unambiguous. In analytical bibliography — with which I am principally concerned — we have been taught to use the critical tools of comparison and analysis in a new way; and the importance of establishing press variants by collation, of detecting setting by formes, of distinguishing between compositors by spellings or impressions by press-figures is no longer questioned. Scientific bibliography, complete with its laboratory aids, has become a new orthodoxy. Yet, as T. S. Eliot puts it, All our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance . In the very act of opening our eyes to new and exciting possibilities, our discoveries raise fresh problems of understanding and breed an awareness of our limitations. In particular, the detailed relation of analytical bibliography to the editing of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century texts depends upon a number of assumptions about printing-house conditions that are only now beginning to be tested. Indeed, if I were to give this paper an epigraph, it might well be that quoted by Sir Karl Popper from Black's Lectures on the Elements of Chemistry published in 1803: "A nice adaptation of conditions will make almost any hypothesis agree with the phenomena. This will please the imagination, but does not advance our knowledge." 2 Our ignorance about printing-house conditions in the 17th and 18th centuries has left us disastrously free to devise them according to need; and we have at times compounded our errors by giving a spurious air of 'scientific' definitiveness to our conclusions. There has of course been nothing morally reprehensible in this, for 'scientific' in such a use has meant little more than an honesty of method in respect to the physical phenomena available for study. 3 As in the physical and natural sciences, at least in their more elementary stages of observation and classification, it has, as I have indicated, simply meant placing the stress in the first instance on a finite number of particulars and drawing a conclusion from them. And since bibliographers very rarely have anything to work on but the physical evidence of the books themselves it has seemed only natural that any methodology should work within these limitations and seek its exactitude by describing and relating only the observable facts of the paper and the marks it bears. Some distinguished bibliographers, it is true, have had their doubts. R. C. Bald remarked that "whatever bibliography may or may not be, it is not an exact science, if one understands by an 'exact' science a branch of study which arrives at its conclusions through experiment and observation and can reproduce the conditions of an experiment so that the results can be repeated and checked at any time ("Evidence and Inference," pp. 2-3). And R. B. McKerrow, late in life and writing more particularly of textual criticism, made much the same point and added the comment that "Nothing can be gained, and much may be lost, by a pretence of deriving results of scientific accuracy from data which are admittedly uncertain and incomplete" ( Prolegomena , p. vii). It is this last point which I wish to take up. The effect of Bald's suggestion that bibliography "cannot claim for its conclusions the same universal validity as belongs to those of the exact sciences" is simply that we should rest content with a very different order of certainty but take the precaution of scrutinizing more frequently than we do the procedures of bibliographical scholarship. McKerrow's comment, however, runs far beyond his intention and offers a radical criticism of the very bases of all knowledge inductively derived. It is not that bibliographical inquiry differs in any essential respect from 'scientific' inquiry as described, but that the method common to both is itself logically unsound. Bibliography, as it happens, is a convenient area in which to demonstrate its unsoundness. For whatever the short-term advantages, to assume, as we have been asked to do, that analytical bibliography must be empirically based, and to limit our knowledge to that which may be derived by inductive inference from direct observations, is to invite the obvious objection that no finite number of observations can ever justify a generalization. Bertrand Russell remarked that so far as he could see induction was a mere method of making plausible guesses. "It is far from obvious, from a logical point of view," writes Sir Karl Popper, "that we are justified in inferring universal statements from singular ones, no matter how numerous; for any conclusion drawn in this way may always turn out to be false: no matter how many instances of white swans we may have observed, this does not justify the conclusion that all swans are white" ( Scientific Discovery , p. 27). David Hume had made essentially the same point: "Even after the observation of the frequent conjunction of objects, we have no reason to draw any inference of any object beyond those of which we have had experience." 4 And more graphically the Lilliputians' ignorance is ironically exposed: "Besides, our histories of six thousand moons make no mention of any other regions than the two great empires of Lilliput and Blefescu." Nor is it simply that there is no logical way of arriving at general truths from the examination of sampled cases. To observe at all is to bestow meaning of some kind on the thing observed; to gather particular pieces of evidence is to seek those relevant to some preconceived notion of their utility. 5 But the main point is that any general laws derived by the inductive method remain highly vulnerable to fresh evidence. Where the known particulars are few, this risk will be greatest. The inductivist in all subjects may of course freely admit that incompleteness is almost invariably a characteristic of his evidence and that his conclusions may therefore be subject to modification when new evidence comes to hand. Looked at in this way the inductive process carries a burden of assumed truth waiting to be converted into proven error: knowledge, that is, comes with the act of disproof. And until that moment arrives we may be offered conclusions that lay claim only to some degree of 'reliability' or 'probability,' based on reasonable assumptions about the comprehensiveness of the evidence used and about the predictability of past or 'normal' examples into the future. 6 Even such a qualified attitude, however, is still inadequate to the demands of bibliography. For one thing, I doubt that 'normality,' in any serious and extended sense, is a meaningful concept. 7 For another, even granting the inductivists' case, I doubt whether bibliography has yet either the body of documentary evidence or the fund of experimental proof necessary to bring most of its conclusions within a usefully narrow range of probabilities. Under present conditions, therefore, we are tempted either to over-stress the few 'proofs' achieved (by restricting further inquiry to a demonstration of their 'normality' and so asking that new conclusions be consistent with it), or conversely (in the greater number of cases where we have little developed knowledge of the causative conditions) to tolerate any number of 'probable' explanations for the same limited range of phenomena. Neither alternative is a particularly happy one. The first protects us from open-ended speculation by a crippling limitation of the subject; the second, although it characterizes the subject as practised, is rarely capable of conclusive demonstrations. 8 But there is another way of looking at the whole problem; nor does it involve any question-begging distinctions between bibliography and 'science,' for it applies equally to both. It simply consists in recognizing the present situation of multiple 'probabilities' as the desirable one and regarding them as hypotheses to be tested de ductively. I am naturally tempted to it because the productive conditions in early printing houses display an incredible variety which, if it is to be re-conceived at all, demands an imaginative facility in devising hypotheses; 9 and also because bibliographers, as a matter of fact, are becoming increasingly concerned to trace processes involving complex relationships less susceptible of conclusive demonstration. More seriously, deductive reasoning (by which a general hypothesis dictates particular possibilities or 'predictions' and rules out others) does offer a sound way to knowledge. Like induction, it is open to logical objection, for no amount of positive evidence can ever conclusively confirm an hypothesis; but one piece of negative evidence, one contradictory occurrence, will conclusively falsify it. These comments are philosophic commonplaces and stated so baldly must seem slightly naive. Yet they do serve to point quite sharply to the two main directions open to bibliographical inquiry. If bibliographers wish to persist as inductivists then they must diligently search out the historical facts which will alone provide a fairly accurate definition of 'normality' and offer these as a corrective to the logical defects inherent in the method. Alternatively they may confess outright the partial and theoretic nature of bibliographical knowledge, proceed deductively, and at the same time practise a new and rigorous scepticism. In fact the nature of 'normality' as so far revealed by historical evidence suggests that the 'norm' comprised conditions of such an irrecoverable complexity that we must in any case adopt the latter course. If the 'scientific' proofs offered in some recent bibliographical analyses of older books were seen philosophically for the conjectures they are, we should I think be nearer the true spirit of scientific inquiry and the humility that always accompanies an awareness of the possibility of fresh evidence and therefore of falsification. The subject would not then be circumscribed by the demand for demonstrable proofs; rather it would be expanded in its hospitality to new ideas and in its search for fresh historical evidence in the service of disproof. Such a method would be, in the best sense, scientific. In the following section I wish to offer some varieties of fresh evidence. Its main implication is that the very fixity of the physical bounds within which we are asked to work is inimical to the development of a sound methodology — first, because if the stress is laid on 'proof' then the small number of paradigms available to us unreasonably restricts the subject; second, because in the present state of our knowledge the finite particulars with which we must work are too few and therefore permit too many alternative generalizations to be induced from them; third, because the conception of 'normality' as a corrective to the undisciplined proliferation of generalizations misrepresents the nature of the printing process; fourth, because induction is necessarily an inconclusive method of inquiry. The evidence is consistent with my belief that we should normally proceed in our inquiries by the hypothetico-deductive method which welcomes conjectures in the positive knowledge that productive conditions were extraordinarily complex and unpredictable, but which also insists that such conjectures be scrutinized with the greatest rigour and, if refuted, rejected.</field>

The annual press accounts show clearly the kinds of expenditure involved in running a small printing house; and the workmen's vouchers for composition, correction and presswork, together with the joiners', smiths', glaziers', plumbers', typefounders', fellmongers', carriers', and printers'-suppliers' bills, reveal the week-by-week operations of a printing house in a detail which is, I believe, unparalleled. In addition the Minute Book of the curators of the Press provides direct evidence of printing charges and edition sizes over the period. 10 With such a wealth of primary documentary material it has been a simple matter to construct detailed production charts for the books printed, showing their progress sheet by sheet and recording the exact division of work between different compositors, correctors and pressmen. It has been a simple matter also to offer definitive details on the wages earned and the actual amount of work done by compositors and press-crews, and to construct work-flow diagrams illustrating the disposition and organization of work within the printing house as a whole on all books and ephemera in production over any one period. It must suffice for the moment simply to observe that the patterns which emerge seem to me to be of such an unpredictable complexity, even for such a small printing shop, that no amount of inference from what we think of as bibliographical evidence could ever have led to their reconstruction. To this Cambridge evidence we may now add the invaluable record of work done in the Bowyers' printing house over the years 1730-9. The ledger which records this work is in the possession of the Grolier Club of New York and is to be edited for the London Bibliographical Society by Mr Keith Maslen. The details which it gives of compositors' and pressmen's work, sometimes week by week, also permit the accurate reconstruction of working conditions, whether for one book or for the printing house as a whole. As Mr Maslen has remarked, "Work patterns are more complex at the bigger and busier London house, but in broad outline the picture is unchanged." 11 Let me now look briefly at our ruling assumptions about the amount of work that a compositor and pressman might get through in an hour, day, or week. On these points, however carefully we qualify it, the evidence such as we have leads us to suppose a maximum setting rate of something like 1000 ens or letters an hour by one man and a printing rate of 250 impressions an hour at full press. 12 Taking each of these figures as averages which allow for imposition, proofing, correction, make-ready, washing and distribution, we may then, to estimate daily production, multiply by twelve to get as totals 12,000 ens and 3000 impressions. Finally, for weekly totals, we multiply by six to get figures of 72,000 ens and 18,000 impressions. These totals, we allow, are probably too high, but translating them cautiously into terms of actual book production, we might say that a quarto of five to six sheets, each containing some 10,000 to 12,000 ens and printed in an edition of 1200 to 1500 copies, would take about a week to produce if only one compositor and one full press were at work on it. Given the conditions mentioned, the logic is impeccable. Nor is it, as a method, foolish simply because we cannot know of occasional human aberrations from these norms. Yet I cannot forbear a quotation from George Eliot's Daniel Deronda : Men may dream in demonstrations, and cut out an illusory world in the shape of axioms, definitions, and propositions, with a final exclusion of fact signed Q.E.D. No formulas for thinking will save us mortals from mistake in our imperfect apprehension of the matter to be thought about . . . [and] the unemotional intellect may carry us into a mathematical dreamland where nothing is but what is not. The Cambridge and Bowyer papers (and they are not the only ones) make it quite clear that wages and therefore output, since the men were on piece-rates, varied considerably as between one man and another. It is not just a matter of occasional lapses or minor disparities to be cautiously conceded; it is a fundamental fact that should radically alter our whole conception of 'norms'. Moreover, any one man's income and therefore his actual output might fluctuate greatly week by week. Taking the Cambridge compositors first, one of them (John Délié) averaged 13s.5d. a week over one period of 59 weeks, and only 9s.9d. over a further period of 80 weeks. Yet on 11 May 1700 he was paid at the rate of £1.6s.8d. a week for setting in two weeks eight sheets of a book which required a daily average of 10,240 ens plus marginal notes. William Bertram averaged 10s.8d. over one period of 78 weeks and 10s. over another period of 47 weeks. Clement Knell and John Muckeus were content to average just over 13s. a week for long periods, and William Great 10s.3d. The only compositor to show sustained application at a high level was Thomas Pokins. His average weekly income over a period of two full years was £1.1s.5d. Yet in the five weeks up to 6 June 1702 he set some 318,000 ens, giving a daily average of 10,600, and his reward for this work was just on £1.7s.11d. a week. To reinforce the implications of these comments on the fluctuations in wages earned, we have only to look at the amount of work actually done in ens per day. Pokins's averages throughout 1702 were 6,307 (not 10,000 or 12,000) ens a day or 37,842 (not 72,000) a week. The next best daily averages for any lengthy period were those of Bertram with 5,700 ens and Knell with 5,603. Often the daily totals were well below these figures, and all of them of course are well below even such an elastic hypothetical norm as 10,000 to 12,000 ens a day. A glance at appendix II (d) below will show a similar variation of performance within the Bowyers' shop. The wages for the two-week period range from as much as £3.15s.od. to as little as 8s.2d. And this personal variation as between compositors may be paralleled by comparable fluctuations in the amount of work done at various periods throughout the year. Strahan's ledgers, although they do not yield the same detail, also show great fluctuations in the total wages he paid out week by week (B. M. Add. MS. 48,801). And the records of the Plantin-Moretus Museum, the Oxford University Press, and even the "Case-Book" of John Wilson, printer in Kilmarnock in 1803, tell the same story. 13 Turning now to presswork, we have precisely the same situation. One of the better performances at full press in Cambridge was that of Jonathan Cotton and Robert Ponder during the week ending 24 February 1700 when for £1.4s.6d. each they worked off 10,350 sheets on four different books, averaging well over 3,400 impressions a day. But such figures and therefore such high incomes were quite exceptional. Albert Coldenhoff, working by himself at half press, earned on average 13s.3d. a week over a period of 67 weeks, and other average weekly wages earned by various workmen at half press were, in round figures, 11s., 12s., 15s. and 18s. At full press the average receipts show the same kind of range. If instead of wage bills we again look at the actual amount of work done, we can point to Thomas Green's single-handed production of 8,250 impressions one week, and only 4,750 the next; or to the work of Ponder and John Quinny who printed the following numbers of impressions week by week from mid-June to mid-July 1700: 15,200; 13,800; 9,700; 12,700; 10,700; 17,000 and so on. The hypothetical norm, you may recall, was 18,000. Well, conclusions? Simply that our hypothetical figures are too high? Certainly that seems to be true, but the implications are I think more far-reaching. One is that we have perhaps failed in our historical sense, too readily imputing our own twentieth-century ideas and interests and the assumptions of our own society — especially our economic assumptions — to men whose attitudes to work were quite different from ours. We cannot afford to disregard contemporary social conditions and pre-Industrial Revolution attitudes. One careers adviser pointed out in 1747 that many pressmen played a great part of the time, and Benjamin Franklin took much the same jaundiced view of the British workman. As one economic historian puts it, "the conditions of life and habits of the people were all against the monotony of regular employment;" and again: "Contemporary evidence indicates that few cared to take advantage of their opportunities." The mass of labourers, said Sir William Temple, work only to relieve the present want. 14 Our society today reacts to the stimulus of high wages because modern society can satisfy a wide range of wants. But if wants don't increase, there is little point in working for anything beyond the bare necessities, and good wages will only suggest to a workman "an opportunity to avoid part of his toil." 15 An anonymous writer of 1728 makes the point well: "People in low life who work only for their daily bread, if they can get it by three days work in a week, will many of them make holiday the other three or set their own price on their labour " (my italics). 16 One of the reasons why Elizabethan printers tried so often to exceed their allowed number of apprentices may have been that apprentices could be commanded to work regularly where journeymen could not. 17 So although we may today think of piece-rates as an incentive, it would seem that in the 17th and 18th centuries they were the employers' best protection from men who had no intention of working any harder than necessary for food and drink. A journeyman's output, that is, was conditioned largely by what he was able or willing to earn. As Moxon revealingly says, "they are by Contract with the Master Printer paid proportionably for what they undertake to Earn every working day, be it half a Crown, two Shillings, three Shillings, four Shillings, &amp;c." (my italics). That is, he speaks quite casually of a performance difference of one hundred per cent. 18 The significance of this system of individual contracts — operating as far back as 1631 and even, I would claim, 1591 — has I think been overlooked. What it meant in effect was that a workman need work no harder than he had contracted to do, and only if he fell behind his contracted figure and then kept another waiting might he have to make good his colleague's loss of work. It was the master's job to accommodate these variables, not the workmen's. That the master had to make payments and organize production schedules on the assumption that men worked at different speeds is quite consistent with the Cambridge and Bowyer evidence and any other that I have seen; nor is it, so far as I know, inconsistent with any of the classically 'demonstrable' bibliographical proofs. But its consequence — the normality of non-uniformity — is an uncomfortable one for any methodology. It might be thought that the fluctuations in output which I have noted are — in part at least — to be expected if there were too little material to keep the men working at high capacity week after week, a state of affairs all too likely in a small provincial academic press. Yet, once more, the evidence available shows a similar pattern at other presses. In fact, both the Cambridge and Bowyer records suggest that fluctuations in the volume of work would be reflected more readily in the number of workmen employed than in the actual level of work done by any one man. 19 Where output varies so markedly from man to man and period to period, any reliance on 'norms' would seem to imply an almost irresponsibly large burden of probable error; polite concessions to occasional departures may serve a while as palliatives but general statements that can be so persistently falsified whenever any concrete evidence appears to test them are poor premises for advanced argument. Moreover, I have for simplicity here dealt mainly in averages; the actual figures are infinitely more varied and any attempt to trace the total complex patterns week by week, even with all the documentary evidence, is like trying to record the changing images of a kaleidoscope in the hands of a wilful child. So far I have discussed, too, only the most elementary variables, and have left aside all question of edition sizes or the ways in which work was organized. Assumptions about the edition sizes of early books usually take account of the 1587 ordinance of the Stationers' Company which, with one or two exceptions, forbade the printing of more than 1250 or 1500 copies of any book from the same setting of type, although as McKerrow remarks "we have no certain knowledge of how long or how carefully the rule was observed." 20 And occasionally edition sizes have been related to the bibliographical evidence of skeleton formes, since it is understood "as a general principle that in any book printed on a single press two sets of headlines will appear only if the book was printed in an edition large enough for composition to keep ahead of presswork." 21 For the later 17th century and the 18th century the problem of variability in edition size is acknowledged to be more complex. Yet even in the early 1590's a pressman, Simon Stafford, giving evidence in court, pointed out that the number of sheets printed in any one day might vary considerably, reflecting different edition sizes, since "they had diverse numbers upon Severall bookes and the numbers did alter." 22 At Cambridge in the early 1700's sermons were printed on average in 650 copies, the minimum being 400 and the maximum 1150. But the mean, as distinct from the average, was nearer 500 copies. One book of theological controversy was printed in a first edition of 750; a second edition of 1000; a third edition of 2000; and a fourth edition of 1250. Yet another of the same author's books ran through three editions in the order of 750, 500 and 500; and another was printed in two editions of 1000 copies each. Other figures for edition sizes of books on a fairly wide range of subjects are: 350, 500, 522, 550, 700, 820, 1050, 1150, 1250, 1500 and 3000. Again the Bowyer papers show a similar variation, apparent even in the Voltaire editions cited in appendix II (g). And the same point is made by the edition sizes given in Strahan's and Ackers' ledgers, and more particularly in those I quote both for the part issues of A New General Collection of Voyages and Travels and the monthly numbers of The London Magazine . Quite apart therefore from these figures invalidating any hypothetical norm (for any particular case, given the degree of variation, would seldom correspond to the assumptions of a guiding hypothesis), the need for a master printer to juggle with such varying totals, as well as the varying abilities of his workmen, reinforces what has been merely hinted at so far about work organization. Normally in bibliographical analysis we are concerned with a particular book, usually a work to be edited, and that great range of printing which our literary interests have not led us to examine must be largely ignored. This is as it should be for life is short and, as Professor Todd has indicated in a disarmingly amusing note, some books are more valuable than others. 23 But the consequences of such selectivity cannot be ignored if bibliography, as the study of the transmission of literary documents, is to continue to lay claim to the serious intellectual status that Greg established for it. I shall return to this point. Meantime I wish to look briefly at a very common assumption, though not a universal one, in bibliographical analysis. It is the assumption that even if the whole resources of a house were not directed towards printing the book under examination, at least one compositor and one press-crew would be set to work fairly consistently on it. 24 Under these conditions we might expect five to six sheets a week to be completed. Again, however, should we not take pause? The occasional prospectus might serve to put us on our guard, for few require printing times of anything like even five sheets a week. And in fact some surviving Cambridge agreements offer delivery times of — as near as matters — one sheet a week. Out of some 36 books of ten or more sheets produced between 1698 and 1705, only 7 were printed at an average rate of more than 2 sheets a week. Suidas , the Greek lexicon, was printed at the rate of 3½ sheets a week, and the remainder of this group of 7 books progress on average at a rate of between 2 and 3 sheets a week each. For 14 books the average was between 1 and 2 sheets, and for 15 books it was no higher than a single sheet and often it was less than that. The Cambridge evidence cannot be discounted by noting that some of these books required careful correction, for the evidence from the Bowyer and Ackers ledgers points exactly the same way. 25 Nor does there seem to be any necessarily significant relationship between the total amount of work on hand and the rate of progress for any one book. The force of these examples is simply that the Cambridge and Bowyer presses, like any other printing house today or any other printing house before them, followed the principle of concurrent production. Obviously the variety of runs gave greater flexibility in the organization of presswork and permitted more economical use of the several sizes of type available; but, however efficiently total production was organized, the system inevitably meant that individual books took longer to print than we might have thought likely, just as most books today take far longer than the productive capacity of the machinery would lead us to expect. The important point, however, was made by Professor Todd many years ago. Under conditions of concurrent production, he remarked, "the book is only one of several components in a more extensive enterprise, and thus exhibits only a portion of the information necessary for its analysis. Until the other portions have been located and the various pieces reassembled in the pattern originally devised the puzzle will remain unsolvable" ("Concurrent Printing," pp. 45-6, 56). And again: "in instances of concurrent printing the bibliographer must examine all the books so related before attempting the analysis of any. To do less than this . . . is to learn little or nothing at all." These remarks cannot be repeated too often, but unfortunately Professor Todd's qualifying comments have tended to minimize their application to "the larger establishments of the eighteenth century [where] the facilities were certainly adequate for simultaneous work on several projects, involving, in some instances, independent groups of compositors and pressmen, in others, the same group intermittently employed, first on a few sheets of one book, then on a few of another." And his more immediate concern, the interpretation of press figures, whose "very presence implies unsystematic piecework engaged in conjunction with other miscellaneous endeavours," has also perhaps encouraged the belief that concurrent production may very well have been a feature of large printing houses in the 18th century but not of smaller and earlier ones. 26 Such a view must be abandoned. No amount of historical quibbling can neutralize the plain facts of the Cambridge documents: an earlier and smaller printing house, never using more than two presses, often one and a half, and occasionally only one, habitually printed several books concurrently. So far as I am aware there is no primary evidence whatever to show that any printing house of the 16th, 17th or 18th centuries did not do likewise. Our mistake here I think goes back to a misreading of an observation by McKerrow. He remarked that "for a printing house to be carried on economically there must be a definite correspondence between rate of composition and the output of the machine room." 27 Notice how all-inclusive his terms are: printing house, machine room. I should like to offer now two quotations which take their origin in McKerrow, and I should like you to notice how in each case McKerrow's valid general statement is transformed into an invalid particular statement. First, Professor Turner: In the Elizabethan printing shops, a cardinal principle of efficient operation was, we suppose, that composition and presswork should proceed at the same rate. If material could be set into type faster than the press could run it off, compositors had to waste time; conversely, if presswork went faster than composition, the pressmen would stand idle. Given pressmen and compositors of reasonable skill, the chief factor determining the speed of the presswork was the size of the edition . . . at this point we become involved in a particular statement . . . and the chief factor determining the speed of composition was the amount and difficulty of the text material to be set into each forme. Ideally one forme ought to be machined in the time required to distribute the immediately preceding forme and to set and impose the next, and in the case of books which got a great deal of text into each forme, as the [Shakespeare] Folio did, this ideal relationship could be approached only if two compositors could set simultaneously. 28 Professor Hinman asks: What plan would ensure the most satisfactory ratio between the time necessary to set one forme of the contemplated book into type and the time needed to print off the desired number of copies of such a forme? — for an efficient balance between composition and presswork was one of the prime requirements of successful printing house operations in the earlier seventeenth century. ( Printing and Proof-Reading , I, 45n.) This last is a quite different and seriously distorting assumption: that an economic relationship between composition and presswork is necessary on any one book for the business as a whole to be successful. The position is really so much more complex; indeed the more variables a printer has to juggle — in numbers of compositors and full or half press-crews, in their individual capacities, in edition sizes, in the number of books on hand, and in the demand for ephemera — the more chance he has of making them compatible and therefore of making his business as a whole economically successful. 29 Such a conclusion is not inconsistent with the figures given earlier to demonstrate the variable levels of production achieved by a printing house; they simply reinforce the point that an 'economic' disposition of men and materials could only be achieved complexly — and that the fine considerations of timing implied by many studies devoted to the analysis of a single work may be a world away from the reality. Relax the time scheme ever so slightly, and a whole house of bibliographical cards comes tumbling down. In particular the correlations often traced between edition size, number of compositors, skeleton formes and presses, must look very different if translated to a context of concurrent printing. But I anticipate. If concurrent production was much the most efficient way of running a printing house, as distinct from the most efficient method of producing a single book, how then, under these conditions, was work apportioned? What kind of range does a compositor's work, for example, show week by week? Although it was by no means rare at Cambridge for a compositor to have a monopoly on any one book, the work was usually shared. Of a sample of 118 Cambridge books, only 50, or 42%, were set by a single compositor; and if we except very short works like sermons, the percentage drops to 24. Moreover it was unusual for a compositor to work for any long period on one book to the exclusion of all others — usually he would be setting type for two or three concurrently. Of the 13 compositors whose work for Bowyer over a two-week period early in 1732 is recorded in appendix II (d), only one was engaged on one book alone. Undoubtedly the main considerations determining the allocation of work were simply a compositor's freedom to do it and the availability of type. If a compositor had no other work on hand he would be transferred to any that might be offering and for which type was available. For normally, even when two or more compositors worked on a book, they did not work together setting sheet and sheet about. What usually happened was that one took over where the other left off and then composed as many sheets as the master found convenient or as other commitments allowed. A quarto edition of Virgil may be cited to make the point. Bertram set sheets A-E, then Crownfield took over and set F-3R, next Michaëlis set 3S-3Z, Bertram then resumed setting, continuing to 4F, Délié was brought in to set 4G, Crownfield took over once more with 4H and finally, after Crownfield had retired at 4O, Bertram set to 4R and finished off the book. Although four compositors were involved, and although Crownfield worked on two sections of the book and Bertram on three, on no occasion were any two men setting simultaneously. Nor incidentally would it be true to say that they were setting alternately. And it would certainly be quite wrong to assume that work was divided so that the book might be printed more quickly. Meantime of course each Cambridge compositor was also concurrently engaged on some other book or books. 30 In appendix II (g) examples 2 and 4, Bowyer's two English editions of Voltaire, show the same pattern of work. Whereas the printing house printed, and individual compositors normally set, several works concurrently, the composition of any one book would therefore usually be a simple matter of progression from sheet to sheet, or from one group of sheets to another, by consecutive compositors. It follows that the compositorial pattern within any such book will rarely offer adequate evidence in itself of the productive conditions but will have been determined by, and will reflect the exigencies of, the general pattern of work in the printing house as a whole over a period of months or even years. Turning now to the other half of the equation — presswork — we must again affirm that the most efficient disposition of work, given the variables to be reconciled, could be achieved only by a highly flexible system. As with composition, the actual manner in which work was apportioned to the men would have depended in part on the number of men employed and the amount of work on hand. But regardless of the size of the plant it seems unlikely that a particular press consistently served the compositor or compositors setting a particular book. At Cambridge, it is quite clear, any press-crew might get any sheet of any book to print off, and consequently it was rare for any book of more than two or three sheets to be printed solely at one press. The production tables for books printed at Cambridge show quite conclusively that the use of two press-crews was a perfectly normal procedure and had nothing whatever to do with increasing the speed of production. If a forme was ready for printing, it went to whichever crew was ready to take it, although usually it seems that a sheet would be printed and perfected by the same crew. The position in the Bowyers' shop is much more complex, for it is clear that formes , not just sheets, might be sent to any press which happened to be free and that any sheet might well be printed at one press and perfected at another. Again the Voltaire and Baxter examples in appendix II (g) make it plain that this practice was very common. In a large shop the distribution of work is likely to be more complex simply because there are more routes open for a book to take; but in both large and small shops there is such strong evidence of fluctuations in the number and strength of press-crews that a pattern of work must very often reflect such changes too. At Cambridge there was considerable variety in the number and composition of the press-crews, ranging from half press only during the first half of 1699, to full press only during the second half of the same year and a good part of 1700, and various combinations of half and full press during other years. Only for a brief period in 1701 were two full presses in operation simultaneously; but we find (unexpectedly, for the usual arrangement we might think would be for the two men to work together at a single press) two half presses at work during 1705, 1706 and part of 1709. There were frequent changes in the composition of the crews during the period from 1699 until early 1702. In later years the normal arrangement — if you will permit the term — was one full press and one half press. But the varying patterns make it extremely difficult to assume a norm. So too in the Bowyers' shop: 3 presses were in use between 24 Dec. 1731 and 15 Jan. 1732; 4 between 17 Jan. and 29 Jan.; 4 (but only 3½ crews) between 31 Jan. and 12 Feb.; 5 between 14 Feb. and 26 Feb.; and 6 (but possibly only 4 full and 2 half crews) between 28 Feb. and 18 Mar. (Just to complicate matters further for the analyst, press no. 7 was in use throughout the whole of this period and the press figure 7 appears on some of the sheets which it printed, but at no time were there as many as seven presses in use.) So a press-crew, just like a compositor only more so, would usually be working on several books at a time, with "All work to be taken in Turn, as brought to the Press, except in such Work as may require Dispatch, or the Compositor will want the Letter . . .". 31 The simplest way of using the crews most efficiently was not to try to maintain a strict relationship between a particular compositor and a particular press — the varying edition sizes and varying output of the men would have made this very difficult — but, given the presswork which was offering, to apportion it so that each crew always had something to go on with. This was the easiest way of accommodating the varying runs required for the different books in production at the same time. In thinking otherwise we may also have under-estimated the flexibility of the common press itself as a machine. Each press had several friskets, ready cut to common formats. It was a very simple matter to change them over; and since the sheets were printed wet on a sopping tympan, the type bit deep into the paper and careful make-ready was unnecessary — certainly it did not need the care of the modern kiss-impression. Technically there was no reason therefore why the press should not work to a number of compositors setting several different books, perhaps within one day, certainly within one week. It is more than time now for us to re-unite the two halves of McKerrow's equation — the 'rate of composition' and 'the output of the machine room'. We have seen that, both at Cambridge and in the Bowyers' shop, books were produced concurrently. This meant not only that several books were in production at the same time but that each workman, whether at press or case, was often engaged on several books more or less at once. If we are correctly to reconstruct the detailed operations of a printing house — even a very small one — or a true account of the printing of any one book, we must therefore do it in a way that shows the complete pattern of work in its full complexity. The diagrams given in appendix I (a) and (b) are an attempt to do this. They show precisely how all work on hand at Cambridge was allocated between 26 Dec. 1701 and 28 Feb. 1702 and convey some impression of the flow of work. 32 Again I am tempted to quote George Eliot and say that the sheets seem to follow only what she calls "the play of inward stimulus that sends one hither and thither in a network of possible paths." Suidas , an exceptional case, demanded the almost undivided attention of four compositors working in pairs on each volume; and Crownfield, Bertram and Pokins spread their work over two to three books each. When we look at the distribution of work to the different press-crews, we note that with one exception every compositor or pair of compositors sent work to both presses; and, moreover, that the work composed during these weeks was in many cases printed by any of four different press-crews. If we take a single book — Psyche , either volume of Suidas , or Whiston's Short View — the point to be made is much the same, that the various sheets of any particular book were likely as not printed at more than one press. The details given for the Bowyer shop in appendix II (a) to (e) cover two distinct periods: first, from 26 Dec. 1730 to 6 Feb. 1731, and second, from 31 Jan. to 26 Feb. 1732. Their testimony in witnessing to the disposition of work is consistent with that of the Cambridge records but the relationships revealed between the several productive units, whether compositors or pressmen, are very much more complex. The information given reveals, for example, the number of pages set by each compositor, the edition size, and the number of formes printed by each press; in the case of appendix II (a) we can also see the peculiar arrangements between presses 1, 3 and 7 for printing and reprinting the Defence of the Present Administration . I take this evidence to be quite conclusive. It shows that the essential procedures for the distribution of work were the same for a larger and later shop as they were for an earlier printing house with only two (or more commonly one and a half) active presses. It shows that although we should doubtless be right to assume — allowing for certain social attitudes and conditions we have mentioned — that composition and presswork as a whole were fairly economically balanced, it would be quite wrong to conclude that this balance was either necessary or possible for work on any individual book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The more substantial matters discussed in the preceding section — workmen's output, edition sizes, and the relationship between composition and presswork under conditions of concurrent production — must now serve as a prelude to notes on a number of bibliographical procedures that imply quite different productive conditions. If the evidence of part II withstands challenge, it must I think be held to falsify several current hypotheses. It is not easy to summarize these but the ones I have in mind relate particularly to compositors' measures, cast-off copy, skeleton formes, proof-correction and press figures. If one assumes that a compositor usually worked on only one book at a time he would have had no need to alter the measure to which he had set his composing stick. Changes in line measurement within any one book might therefore be taken to indicate an abnormal interruption, after which the stick was reset to a slightly different measure, or the presence of a second compositor. 33 Professor Bowers cites, for example, Bellon's The Mock-Duellist (1675) in which sheets B-F are set with a 120 mm. measure and sheets G-I with a measure of 121 mm. "In such a book the inference is probably that with sheet G another compositor . . . took over the work. In general, one is likely to conjecture that any interruption of the printing sufficient to cause a single compositor to adjust his stick again after working on some other book would most likely have been sufficient to cause the skeleton-formes to be broken up . . ." ("Bibliographical Evidence," p. 157). These conclusions must, however, seem misplaced if one begins from a different premise. If we assume concurrent production, for example, then the likelihood of measures reflecting the division of work among compositors will be small. In the first place, production times were too long; and in the second place, compositors working on several books at a time, often in quite different sizes of type, would have had to change their measure constantly. As it happens, these propositions are consistent with the Cambridge evidence, whereas analysis of a few of the Cambridge books suggests that it would be impossible to judge how compositorial work was divided on any of them from the evidence of measures. Not only do the widths of type-pages set by the same compositor vary, but different compositors are often found setting to an identical measure, and interruptions are routine. The general practice inferred from limited physical evidence and the underlying assumption about work method remain mutually consistent, but in most cases they are likely to be quite wrong. One of the more delicate exercises in advanced analytical bibliography is tracing the pattern of skeleton formes as evidenced by running titles in order to determine the order of presswork and, it might be claimed, the number of presses used. This pattern may be related by a time scale to another showing compositorial stints, or it may of itself be taken to imply a certain number of compositors at work on the book. The relationship indicated between composition and presswork may then be employed as an analytical tool in determining such things as nature of copy, methods of setting, edition size and proofing procedures. Implicit in all such analyses is the fundamental assumption that composition and presswork on a particular book would normally seek a condition of balance. This is a difficult area in which to order the work done while being fair to the arguments of those who have used such evidence; nor am I confident that I fully understand the analytical principles used. But the subject is important and even at the risk of misrepresentation demands discussion. The pioneer study in the use of headlines, as in much else, was written by Professor Bowers over thirty years ago. 34 The association of sets of headlines with skeleton formes is now so well evidenced that it may be taken for granted, and, as Professor Bowers has also remarked, "the basic principles of the printer's use of headlines did not differ markedly in any period when books were printed by hand." 35 Where a single skeleton was used for both formes of a sheet, the press was idle while the forme just off the press was being washed and stripped and its skeleton was being transferred to the type pages which were next to be printed. . . . Some printers used two skeletons, each with its own set of headlines. Thus while one forme was on the press, the skeleton was being stripped from an already printed forme and imposed about the type pages next to be printed. Since the transfer of this second skeleton could take place while the press was printing the first, there was no delay at all between the time a forme was removed from the press and the time the new one was planked down on the bed (pp. 188-9). The phrase 'the press was idle' is perhaps misleading since under conditions of concurrent printing the press would not be 'idle' at all but employed on another book. It has however had considerable repercussions and a great many bibliographical arguments have been constructed on the assumption that this inferred idleness could not have been the norm and must have been avoided in order to secure a balanced relationship of composition and presswork. So Professor Turner: "In order to effect the minimum press delay, the formes . . . would have had to go through the press in the following order . . .". 36 ". . . in one-skeleton work the press was forced to stand idle . . .". 37 "There is every reason to believe that press delays were abhorrent to the 17th-century printer" (" The Maid's Tragedy ," p. 217). ". . . a compositor would not change from setting by formes to seriatim setting without risking a press delay unless he was ahead of his press . .." 38 ". . . the adoption of one-skeleton printing for several formes, and the resultant press delays . . ." (" Philaster ," p. 28). "If we assume that two skeletons would have been employed in the most efficient manner . . .". 39 ". . . working on the assumption that composition and presswork could stay more-or-less in balance . . ." 40 ". . . two formes . . . would not have been machined concurrently, for had they been, a delay in presswork would have resulted." 41 Professor Hinman, however, extended the argument by pointing out that if a book were printed in a very small edition, printing would be so well ahead of setting that a second skeleton would be of little use. The press will inevitably be obliged to stand idle periodically, waiting for the compositor to get new material for it. In such circumstances, of course, there would be no point in accelerating presswork speed further by the use of two skeletons; for although the use of two skeletons can speed up presswork, it cannot increase composition speed: however many skeletons are employed, the same number of impositions will be required ("New Uses for Headlines," p. 209). Professor Hinman then suggests that if the edition were a very large one, however, the reverse might be true. Printing would take longer than setting and the pressmen might well seek to avoid delays and restore the balance by using two skeletons. Hence Professor Bowers has subsequently stated that "certain assumptions can be made about the rate of compositorial to press speed and thus about the number of copies printed"; 42 and Professor Williams has remarked that "in a small edition press time would be briefer than composition time and the compositor would always be concerned lest he fall behind and so delay his press." 43 Yet another application was indicated by Professor Hinman when he noted that skeleton formes "have an intimate connection with various possible methods of stop-press correction" ("New Uses for Headlines," p. 222). Applying this principle in a re-examination of the proofing of Lear , Professor Bowers wrote: With one-skeleton printing there is nothing for the press to work on when the forme is removed for correction. The most obvious thing to do with two skeletons is to plug this gap by putting the second forme on the press and pulling its proofs so that correction in the type can be made at leisure without further halting the press. 44 At the same time he offered a succinct restatement of the basic position: Two-skeleton printing was an extension of one-skeleton, devised to secure relatively continuous presswork by avoiding the major delay at the press which occurred when a new forme was imposed for printing. 45 The temporal relationship between composition and presswork here assumed is however capable of many permutations. One might start with evidence of presswork and seek signs of, or infer, compensating adjustments in composition; alternatively, one might begin with some knowledge of the speed of composition and then try to trace evidence of presswork to match. In the first case the evidence of presswork will almost invariably be in the shape of skeleton formes, although their interpretation may not always be straightforward. Do they, for example, indicate one press or two? Professor Bowers long ago remarked that "the evidence of running-titles to determine the number of presses is often dubious in the extreme and its application hazardous." 46 And Greg expressed some doubt about the equation of skeleton formes with presses. 47 Yet such equations have been made. Professor Price, writing of Your Five Gallants , claimed that "in 1607 [Eld] had at least two presses, as the running-titles . . . show." And again, writing of Michaelmas Term , "the series of running-titles seem to imply that at least four presses worked on the book." 48 Professor Bowers: "Since regularly alternating two-skeleton formes produce maximum efficiency for one-press work, the staggered appearance of three skeletons . . . suggests the use of two presses." On this assumption, it becomes possible to observe a "mathematical regularity of transfer between the presses according to a fixed and efficient system"; hence "the three-skeleton pattern . . . is proof of two-press printing" (my italics). 49 And again: "The analysis of running titles reveals that two presses printed Q2 [ Hamlet ]," each press being served by a different compositor. 50 It is not surprising then to find others writing of "a normal pattern for two-compositor work in which each man serves a different press." 51 And writing of The Revenger's Tragedy , Professor Price noted that the four skeletons present suggest two presses, adding that elsewhere "Eld's pressmen clearly revealed their use of two presses by printing on different stocks of paper." 52 The attractive simplicity of Professor Bowers' initial proposition about skeleton formes is no longer easy to discern. Nevertheless it has been repeatedly put to use in order to determine also the number of compositors engaged on a book. In an article on the printing of Romeo and Juliet Q2, for example, we are told that "variant compositorial characteristics suggest the presence of two compositors" and are assured that "the mechanical evidence of presswork corroborates that suggestion" (my italics). The quarto was printed from two skeletons recurring in regular sequence. The writers continue: "This evidence from running titles can be explained only with great difficulty as accompanying the work of one compositor; but a reasonable explanation may be offered by resorting to the hypothesis of a second press, and thus of a second compositor " (my italics). 53 Earlier, Professor Bowers had remarked that "printing by two presses must necessarily require the services of two compositors" ("Bibliographical Evidence," p. 166 n. 13). Again that a "general alternation involving the use of four skeleton formes is inexplicable for printing with one press; yet if we hypothesize two presses it follows that there must have been more than one compositor." 54 In another case, where only one skeleton-forme was used, "the running-title pattern indicates no second workman." 55 Professor Turner has written: "One skeleton ordinarily means one compositor; two may mean two setting simultaneously . . .". 56 But the clearest example of skeleton formes in relation to composition is offered by Hamlet Q2, in which "compositor X served one press and imposed his formes for that press, whereas compositor Y served a second press and, correspondingly, imposed his own distinct formes for that press." These observations led Professor Bowers to remark that "when, as in Hamlet , the spelling tests for compositors equate so precisely with what one may conjecture to have been their stints from the evidence of running-titles, we may be somewhat more confident in the future about roughing-out two-compositor work in books on this running-title evidence" ("Printing Hamlet Q2," pp. 41-42). There would appear to be enough flexibility in the principle to allow its reverse application, for, as in the case of Romeo and Juliet , two skeletons may become two presses if there is some slight evidence of two compositors (and hence "corroborate" the suggestion that there are two compositors). But since compositors have left no skeletons they are less easy to detect than headlines, and there are therefore fewer cases of presswork conditions being inferred from the prior evidence of composition. By now I hope I have, at the very least, made clear by selection and juxtaposition the multiple and often confusingly diverse general statements inferred from the number and order of skeleton formes, 57 and laid bare the fundamental assumptions about desirable ratios between compositors and press-crews. It simply remains to ask how reliable such analyses would turn out to be if tested by analogy (a fair enough procedure, since their authors imply extended application by analogy). Two Cambridge books may serve: Beaumont's Psyche (1702), a folio in fours, and Newton's Principia (1713), a quarto ( Cambridge University Press , I, 126-7, 219-21). To take Psyche first, and in particular the quires 2E-2Z which can be related to full work-flow charts, 58 we may observe that the edition was 750; that only one compositor worked on it at a time (Bertram set 2E-2F, 2K-2Q½, 2T½-2Z; Crownfield 2G-2I, 2Q½-2T½); that four skeleton formes were in regular use; and that setting and printing of these 19 quires, or 38 sheets, took about 20 weeks in all (from mid September 1701 to 31 Jan. 1702). All I wish to establish now is the futility of attempting to infer any direct correlation of presswork with these conditions from the four skeleton formes. Two quires set by different compositors (2F-2G), and with identical forme patterns, were both printed at the same full press; two quires set by the same compositor (2K-2L), but with utterly different forme patterns, were both printed by the same half press; two quires set by the same compositor (2O-2P), and with identical forme patterns, were both printed at the same half press; all four skeletons appear in quire 2T, one sheet of which was printed at one full press and the other sheet of which was printed at another full press; all four skeletons appear in quire 2U, one sheet of which was printed at full press and the other sheet of which was printed at half press. And yet if this evidence were not available it would be perfectly respectable to infer that this regular use of four skeletons might mean either (a) a large edition; or (b) two compositors, if not three; or (c) at least one full press in continuous operation. Newton's Principia is a little easier to deal with since it is a quarto, and although there are four skeletons in all, only two of these were in use at any one time. The first printed most outer formes in sheets C-2P, the second most inner formes; in 2Q-2V their roles were reversed. New skeletons were constructed for 2X, one printing all inner formes to 3P, the other all outer formes. Under these very straightforward conditions, we might normally infer one of the following: (a) There was a single compositor, but the press was evidently lagging behind composition; therefore two skeletons were used to save imposition time. We might also infer a fairly large edition. (b) The edition was probably small and presswork regularly ahead of composition — especially since the text was in Latin and cuts had to be accommodated within it; but nothing would be gained by the use of two skeletons under such conditions unless, say, two compositors were at work. (c) The reversal of skeletons at 2Q is probably insignificant, but a serious interruption undoubtedly occurred after the printing of 2V when the first two skeletons were broken up. I trust that this example is thought to be no worse for its approximations than most such arguments, but it seems to me to point up once more the nature of our guiding assumptions about skeleton formes and the relationship of composition to presswork. In doing so it also indicates the likely error in our general statements on these matters since their claim to represent the truth can be falsified by contradictory case-studies. If, as for many books, there were no external evidence to control speculation, any of the explanations given above, suitably sophisticated, could be employed in a publishable account of the printing of the Principia . The facts of the matter are: the edition was 700; only one compositor at a time worked on the book (Pokins set B, 2Q-3R, a-d; Délié C-2P); the book was printed at both full press (49 sheets) and half press (17 sheets) without these conditions in any way being reflected in the number or order of skeletons; when there were changes in skeletons, press conditions remained constant; a delay of some months in 1712 is unmarked by the skeletons; the mere reversal of skeletons at 2Q was preceded by a delay of 11 months; the creation of entirely new skeletons for 2X may have been related to a delay of about 3 months; the first pair of skeletons were in use for over 2 years, the second for 1½ years; printing of the 66 sheets in the book extended from October 1709 until May 1713. 59 I have not examined the skeleton formes in Bowyer books, but the fact that the sheets in them were often printed at one press and perfected at another must render very complex indeed any analysis seeking to relate compositors, formes and presses — even with the help of press figures. It cannot be assumed that other and earlier presses did not do likewise (without the figures); it is just that we happen to know for certain in some cases what the Bowyers did. I wish now to broaden the argument a little by adverting to the Shakespeare First Folio and by offering yet another case-study. When Professor Hinman writes: Long sequences of Folio formes were often set by two compositors setting simultaneously; yet one press regularly printed off these formes as rapidly as they were set. Now, unless our estimates are badly at fault, this would not have been possible if the edition had consisted of many more than about 1,200 copies. Nor on the other hand could two compositors (and no more than two seem ever to have set type for the Folio at any given time) have kept even one press continuously busy if the edition had been of appreciably less than 1,200 copies . . . 60 When Professor Hinman makes this point, he is deducing the probable size of the edition from an hypothesis about timing. The tentative nature of this deduction is made very clear and Professor Hinman's scholarship is of such excellence that it is seldom possible to offer views that he has not already entertained. Yet there can be no mistaking the main import of the above passage: two compositors and one press working on the Folio alone yield 1200 edition-sheets a day. Obviously, without full information about all other work on hand, one cannot falsify Professor Hinman's argument or its implication that the printing of the Folio was, by and large, a self-contained operation. Nor, without such evidence, can one prove it. But it may be salutary to consider its status as a general proposition which is likely to be true for other books of the period. For, as Professor Hinman himself says, Because the Folio was a book it must have been produced by methods which, in part at least, were followed in the making of other books; and investigative techniques that are of value in the study of the printing of the Folio should be useful in other studies too ( Printing and Proof-Reading , I, 13). Now if roughly comparable books show quite different conditions of production, the above hypothesis about timing and the deduction from it about edition size will be weakened. More, its proven inability to predict the other possibilities will severely limit its standing as a statement of general application. Volume I of the 1705 Cambridge-printed edition of the Greek lexicon Suidas is perhaps a book that is "roughly comparable" ( The Cambridge University Press , I, 224-33). It is a folio in fours, with some 954 pages, about 8,500 ens per forme set double column in English Greek and English Latin with Long Primer footnotes; being started by 1 Nov. 1701 and finished by 4 Sep. 1703, it took some 22 months to print: the edition size was 1500 (150 large-paper copies, 1350 smallpaper); it was set throughout by two compositors working simultaneously on each forme; 166½ sheets were printed at full press and 72 at half press. The Shakespeare volume is a folio in sixes, contains just under 900 pages, has about 10,600 ens per forme set double column in Pica English; according to Professor Hinman's table it took about 18½ months to print but if we add the 2½ months given as the possible length of an interruption, the total would be 21 months; and Professor Hinman suggests an edition of about 1200 on the assumption that two compositors and one press were working on it more or less continuously. It would be foolish to think of these two books as being any more than only very roughly comparable; the Shakespeare Folio is in English, not Greek and Latin, and has 22 fewer sheets than the Suidas volume. Yet the Folio has slightly more ens to the sheet and Suidas took slightly longer to print, so that in the quantitative matters of bulk, relation of composition to presswork, printing time, and edition size, the two books are not perhaps so very different. When we discover, however, that throughout exactly the same period as the one in which the first volume of Suidas was being printed the identical one-and-a-half presses that printed it also served three to four other compositors, two of them often working simultaneously, to print another 1500 copies of the second volume of Suidas — yet another Shakespeare Folio as it were — as well as 20 other books whole or in part and at least 23 smaller jobs, then we might be forgiven for thinking that Professor Hinman's estimate is badly at fault. Nevertheless my point is not that his equation (two compositors and one press yield 1200 edition-sheets a day) is wrong — indeed, under some conditions it might well be exact — but that it seriously misrepresents the general conditions of book production. 61 If I am right, and there is miscalculation somewhere, the reason for it probably lies in an inference drawn from skeleton formes, and its consequences return us to the subject of concurrent printing. For the purity of Professor Hinman's argument virtually commits him to the view that the Folio was printed on one press, "the Folio press." Apart from 18 quires near the beginning, the Folio is a one-skeleton and therefore, it is claimed, a one-press book: ". . . throughout most of the book, indeed, two-press work was manifestly impossible, the same skeleton having been used in successive formes . . .". 62 Professor Hinman here means that two presses cannot have been in simultaneous use, but as he says at another point: Only one press at a time can possibly have been used, and it is but reasonable to suppose that the successive Folio formes, once set, were ordinarily delivered to the same pressmen and printed at the same "Folio" press. 63 Moreover, two compositors working together and serving this one press are thought to represent an ideally self-sufficient relationship for an edition of about 1200 copies, and since apparently this is the condition more frequently found, it seems clear that the printing of the Shakespeare collection was planned as a self-contained operation, one that could be economically conducted altogether apart from the other printing tasks with which the establishment was concerned. Yet the plan was by no means inflexible. It allowed for the concurrent production of other occasional work. First of all, however, it provided for the independent printing of Shakespeare's plays (I, 75). Professor Hinman's main stress here, and his concession, are the crux of the matter. At times of course most analytical bibliographers working in this field have to confess an imbalance of composition and presswork on a book, either implicitly by failing to pursue the point or explicitly by marking breaks in an otherwise apparently consistent pattern. When this happens, some odd jobbing at case or press is a likely and convenient suggestion to restore the ratio and avoid idleness. This opportunistic resort to a theory of concurrent printing need not be documented at length but it is important to note its circumstantial origins. For much of the Shakespeare Folio, set by one man, there is persistent evidence that the economic considerations behind the plan (at least in the form suggested) did not apply; and to explain the apparent imbalance Professor Hinman allows that 'the Folio press' must have engaged in some concurrent printing: It would be rash to suggest that, if only one compositor at a time set type for the Folio, the Folio press (as for convenience we may call it) must always have stood idle half the time. It could have been used to print other, non-Folio matter — if only this other matter were available. And doubtless it sometimes was; but not always, not regularly (I, 74). And again: Fairly often, therefore, though rarely for long, the rate at which composition for the Folio normally progressed was halved, and accordingly the full-time services of the press were not required for Folio printing. But we need not suppose that press time was therefore wasted. It is in the highest degree probable that, on at least most of these occasions, both the Folio press and one of the Folio compositors were used to produce other work — presumably job work . . . 64 If I now seem to labour a point it is simply because Professor Hinman's account of the printing process reflects and therefore lends massive authority to the erroneous assumption that a book was normally put into production as an independent unit. The single skeleton forme, its association with 'the Folio press', the suggested edition size, the 'economic' balance between compositors and press-crew, all combine to reinforce this view. What is offered as exceptional — occasional concurrent printing — other evidence would suggest to be normal; what is offered as normal — a self-contained operation — is elsewhere exceedingly rare. Neither the Cambridge nor Bowyer papers would permit such inferences to be drawn from skeleton formes; neither would permit such assumptions to be made about the operations of a single press; neither would be consistent with the general economic argument put forward. Nor is it, I think, a matter of proven historical difference, as though the early 17th century were doing something that the 18th century no longer found necessary. For no differences have been constated that cannot be seriously questioned by exposing the primary assumptions. Noting at one point that most of the Folio was printed by a single press, Professor Hinman revealingly adds: Or, conceivably, by two presses working alternately on different formes; but this, for all practical purposes, would amount to the same thing. 65 With all respect, one is obliged to say that 'for all practical purposes' it would not. The moment we admit the possibility of two presses we halve the work of one of them on the Folio and concede that each is concurrently printing other books as well. The problems of calculating the ratio between compositors and press-crews are doubled, for the ratio must be assessed for each crew and the assessment must take full account of all other work on hand. The pattern of work becomes far more complex as the various edition-sheets for different books are printed off one with another at the two presses. For some limited theoretic purposes the ratios abstracted by Professor Hinman may be sound, but his evidence, as he concedes, is consistent with normal conditions of concurrent printing at press, and much of the time with concurrent work at case. The implications of assumptions which seem to be so much at odds with usual printing conditions do not end here: It is demonstrable, that a single press could (and did) print off a Folio forme at least as fast as two compositors working simultaneously, one on each of its two pages, could set such a forme. Hence there can be no doubt that composition by one compositor ordinarily took at least twice as long as the machining of the forme. 66 Under the latter conditions 'there would be a gross imbalance between composition and presswork', under the former 'a highly efficient ratio'. Professor Hinman makes much of the economic reasons for simultaneous setting, and hence setting by formes: With some emphasis let it be said, for the point is vital, that casting off copy would make possible the simultaneous setting of different Folio pages by different compositors . Hence Jaggard might well have undertaken it even if his supplies of type had been unlimited (I, 74). Again, an economic ratio of composition and presswork for the Folio could be effected, and effected economically, if two compositors worked simultaneously on its various formes — and Jaggard probably cast off the copy for it with precisely this end in view (I, 75). By displacing type-shortage as the primary reason for casting off copy, and substituting an economic relationship dependent on assumptions about timing, Professor Hinman not only diminishes the classical status of his own major demonstration but starts a bibliographical hare. The constant factor throughout the Folio is shortage of type because of the method of quiring, and Professor Hinman himself makes it clear that this "may have made it more or less mandatory to set the Folio by formes." His attempt to give an extended generality to his brilliant particular and practical proof from type-shortages misrepresents the general conditions of work, not only in Jaggard's shop but in the period as a whole. For this again is my immediate concern: the encouragement given to the view that even where there is no conclusive evidence of type-shortages, revealed by the presence of identical sorts in both formes of a sheet or in the first half of a quire, we may have setting by formes. In such cases reliance is usually placed on a 'pattern of distribution' — evidence which is used with most admirable insight and control by Professor Hinman but which, in lesser hands, and in quarto printing, may prove very tricky indeed. In a folio of course the major production unit was the quire and (now that Professor Hinman has pointed it out) it is obvious enough why in a folio in sixes type should be inadequate for normal page-by-page setting. In a quarto, however, the reasons are far from clear, and despite Professor Turner's assurance that "it begins to appear that [Elizabethan play quartos] were more often than not composed by formes" (my italics) ("Printing King and No King ", p. 255), a certain scepticism ought perhaps still to be exercised. Professor Williams, for example, arguing that the quarto Epicedium (1594) was so composed, implied considerable concern on the compositor's part at setting vv for w, an assessment by the compositor of the number of w's required for the work, a count of those available to him in the case, and a decision to set by formes for this one reason despite attendant complications. In another case "Random mixing of roman and italic forms of 'k', 'K', 'S' and 'Q' . . . are common in the quarto and are without significance. The shortage of lower-case 'w', on the other hand, discloses a pattern throughout the quarto." 67 But one may fairly ask whether it is safe to prove a case by accepting only such limited 'patterned' evidence. The idea that a 'pattern' must be significant because it appears to indicate a regular method of work is one of the most perniciously seductive presuppositions of current bibliographical analysis. The conflicting evidence of 'k' is disregarded in part because it "violates the order of imposition and printing as disclosed by the running-title evidence." For "evidence from running titles indicates that outer B preceded inner through the press." This of course is merely a further assumption given the status of proof (and then applied as such) because the skeleton formes can , but arbitrarily, be ordered in a pattern. In the Shakespeare Folio, Professor Hinman noted, "As a rule . . . no forme has types in common with either the forme immediately preceding or that immediately following it" ( Printing and Proof-Reading , I, p. 81); and the sequential relation of setting, printing, and distribution here implied has been adapted for the quartos. Professor Turner had earlier given it shape when, writing of Philaster , he observed that types which originally appear in B(o) reappear through sheet C; whereas types which originally appear in B(i) do not reappear in sheet C but do reappear in sheet D. Therefore, B(i) must have been distributed after B(o) and doubtless followed it through the press. 68 Mr John Hazel Smith, discussing Much Ado , offers a similar argument: "The precedence of A(i) is proved by three italic types (B 1 , B 2 , d 1 ) from that forme which are then divided between the formes of B." And again: That Much Ado is composed by formes will be abundantly clear later. It is already indicated by the types (B 1 , B 2 , d 1 ) which appear in two adjacent sheets: under seriatim composition it would be very rare to find, as we find several times in this quarto, on the first or second page of a second sheet a type from either forme of a first sheet (p. 11). And Professor Turner's subsequent formulation gives the principle a usefully definitive form: in a quarto set by formes, type from the first forme of each sheet normally reappears in both formes of the succeeding sheet, but type from the second forme only in the second forme of the succeeding sheet. 69 Mr Smith's study is probably the least fortunate example of an attempt to prove setting by formes in a quarto by "applying scientific bibliographical methods," for Professor Hinman has since pronounced it wrong. 70 But the irony is that the methods used by Mr Smith were those "illustrated by the work of Charlton Hinman on the Shakespeare First Folio and by George W. Williams and Robert K. Turner, Jr, on other Renaissance quartos" ("Compositor of Much Ado ", p. 10). And some of these methods are not, inherently, very reliable. 71 The comment called for here can only be a very general and cautionary one. Neither the Cambridge nor Bowyer records offer much positive evidence of setting by formes; although their combined testimony does demonstrate the rarity of such a practice for books other than page-for-page reprints and must therefore give us pause. We must recall too that neither Moxon, Stower, nor any other early grammar mentions casting off as a means of enabling work to be set by formes. In every case it is, as Stower puts it in his index, a "manner of calculating in order to ascertain the number of sheets a manuscript will make, the size of the letter being fixed on" 72 — that is, a device for costing, and for determining the paper required, not for organizing work. Nowadays we call it estimating. As Professor Hinman observes, actual casting off for setting would not have been undertaken without good reason, although it is true that the difficulties may have been overestimated for verse plays as distinct from full prose works ( Printing and Proof-Reading , I, 73). But if, as is claimed, "the practice was by no means uncommon" and "is to be seen in first quartos that issued from many different printing houses, over a wide stretch of years" ("Shakespeare's Texts," p. 31), it is to be hoped that firmer controls will be applied in its demonstration than have hitherto been evident. In particular, arguments heavily reliant on time-schemes will rarely command that ready assent which was given to Professor Hinman's initial proof that the Folio must have been set by formes. 73 On the face of it, the most important reason for setting by formes in quarto is unlikely to have been urgency, nor even an unusually small fount, but a fount depleted because of concurrent printing — for if work overlapped on two or more books using the same fount of type, setting by formes would offer a method of making some progress with all. Professor Hinman has again led the way in showing how, in Jaggard's shop, concurrent setting of other books, reduced the supply of type for the Folio. If copy is cast off for a quarto text, there is no compelling reason why any sheet should not be printed in any order — say, H, F, A, C, D, B, E, G. One might expect and assume a straightforward progression through the book, but there is no compelling reason for it. But order of formes through the press is an important ingredient in much bibliographical work. Where there is detectable damage in the course of printing (whether to types, headlines, rules or ornaments) it may be quite possible to prove order, and in some cases a precedent forme, at least within the same sheet, may be determined by using the Martin-Povey lamp. I am not sure whether it is evidence of this kind that led Professor Turner to write that "information about presswork, specifically the order of the formes through the press, is relatively easy to obtain and is based on evidence that is the least controvertible" ("Beaumont and Fletcher Folio", p. 36), but, so far as I can tell, order has usually been determined, not according to such evidence, but according to a pattern of headline recurrences. "Evidence from running titles indicates that outer B preceded inner through the press" (Williams, "Setting by Formes", p. 43) is a familiar form of wording; or "on the evidence of running titles, it is clear that B(o) was machined before B(i)". I confess that I have never understood what was meant when I have read such a phrase, and again I suspect that priority is based on assumptions about timing, and inferences drawn from variants, from a pattern of alternating skeletons, or from reappearing types which permit a hypothesis about distribution. In any case, whatever the internal patterns which some physical features may take within a book, there is little reason to elucidate them by constructing a time-scheme or by supposing the successive printing of all formes of the same book. I know of no evidence that obliges us to think of one sheet (or forme) being followed immediately on the press by another of the same book. There is some case for it when perfecting, none between sheets. There is too much evidence in the Cambridge books of perfectly regular patterns sustained under the most diverse conditions of concurrent printing. It is not always easy to tell when an apparently general statement is really only a singular one made of a particular book, but if it is generally true, as Professor Turner says, that "to prove the order of printing is usually to prove the order of composition of the formes" ("Beaumont and Fletcher Folio", p. 37), important textual consequences may follow from the initial assumptions. 74 It is perhaps worth looking briefly at one Cambridge book, Bennet's Answer to the Dissenters Pleas (2nd ed., 1700). Its testimony is not all that important, since it is a page-for-page reprint, yet it does show quite vividly that, once copy is cast off, any sequence of setting and printing might be followed. The sheets were composed as follows: Bertram set E, K by 13 Jan. 1700; B, H, S by 20 Jan.; Knell set C by 26 Jan.; Bertram D, L, U and X/* by 10 Feb.; Knell completed F, G½ between 20 Jan. and 17 Feb.; G½, I by 24 Feb.; Bertram P, Q, R by 24 Feb.; N, O, T by 2 Mar.; Knell A, M by 9 Mar. The order of printing appears to have been: E, H, K, B, L, S, U, C, D, F, X/*, G, I, R, Q, N, O, P, A, M, T ( Cambridge University Press , I, 192-3). The Cambridge papers, if not those of the Bowyers, provide very clear evidence of regular proof-correction of all books printed. Such a practice may have been slightly unusual as many of the books were classical texts and the press prided itself on its accuracy, yet I think not, for London houses in the 18th century, like Cambridge, regularly set as their price for proofing one-sixth of the rate of composition. 75 There is considerable doubt, however, about the validity of applying 18th-century evidence to Elizabethan books; even Moxon's testimony from the later 17th century has been rejected as irrelevant to the earlier period. If this is so, then the 'norms' used to introduce some measure of probability into analytical accounts of the proofing and printing of earlier books will themselves be only inferential. Moxon, we may recall, notes that: The Press-man is to make a Proof so oft as occasion requires . . . The Compositer having brought the Form to the Press , lays it down on the Press-stone , and the Press-man . . . Pulls the Proof-sheet . . . carries the Form again to the Correcting-stone and lays it down: And the Proof he carries to the Compositers Case [pp. 302-3]. And the Compositer gives the Correcter the Proof and his Copy to Correct it by: which being Corrected , the Correcter gives it again to the Compositer to Correct the Form by [p. 233]. Having corrected it, the compositor carries the Form to the Press , and lays it on the Stone for a Second Proof , and sometimes for a Third Proof ; which having Corrected , he at last brings the Form to the Press , and again lays it on the Stone . . . After all this Correcting a Revise is made, and if any Faults are found in any Quarter of it, or in all the Quarters , he calls to the Press-man to Unlock that Quarter , or the whole Form , that he may Correct those Faults . . . [pp. 238-9]. And before continuing printing, the pressman will check 4 thly , That no Letters or Spaces lye in the White-lines of the Form ; which may happen if the Compositer have Corrected any thing since the Form was laid on the Press , and the Compositer through oversight pickt them not all up [p. 269]. Professor Bowers has remarked, however, that Moxon describes a method of pulling proofs that interrupted the printing whenever a forme to be proofed was prepared. The delay would not be equally serious, but on the evidence this does not seem to have been the usual Elizabethan practice ( Bibliography and Textual Criticism , p. 103 n. 1). To make this point is to stress again the primary importance of continuous printing at press. Professor Hinman would doubtless agree, for he says that The proof-correction practices spoken of by Moxon may have been common in his day, but they were certainly not so in the 1620's ( Printing and Proof-Reading , I, 228 n. 1). But Professor Hinman's basic reason for rejecting Moxon's account as in any way relevant to the 1620's has little to do with timing. It is rather the many self-evident errors that survive in the printed text. Discussing — and dismissing — in a footnote the idea that regular proofing may have preceded that established by a collation of the variants he has observed, Professor Hinman notes: there are far too many obvious errors of all kinds in far too many Folio pages to allow us to think that any such preliminary reading as may have been done for this book, whether with or without benefit of some kind of printed proof, and whether by compositor or by an official 'corrector of the press', ever amounted to much (I, 228 n. 2). It is a view that in general Professor Bowers would probably — and reciprocally — endorse, since he has observed that The automatic assumption is surely wrong that every forme of cheap commercial printing was necessarily proof-read. Any editor of Elizabethan play quartos is familiar with some formes in which the typographical errors are so gross as to make it seem impossible to suppose that these formes had been read ( Bibliography and Textual Criticism , p. 126). It may seem singularly fool-hardy not to follow such authority, but I am constrained to persist in a certain incredulity. Professor Hinman's failure to list the 'many obvious errors of all kinds' at least makes one's task of qualification a little easier since he has not, in this case, sufficiently illustrated, let alone proved, his point. If Moxon, and proofing practices so well evidenced elsewhere in the century and beyond it, are to be displaced as the 'norm', the question would seem to demand rather fuller discussion than I have yet seen devoted to it. The view that Professor Hinman is concerned to question is, essentially, Greg's — that in the Folio "the printer was not indifferent to the accuracy of his text." 76 And it may well be that if we were "once possessed of a full record of the press variants in the First Folio" ( Printing and Proof-Reading , I, 227), such a view might have to be altered. Professor Hinman's labours of collation leave him in no doubt that now "there is in fact considerably more evidence that the printer was largely indifferent to the accuracy of his text" (I, 227). Yet such a conclusion is scarcely judicious; there is a great difference between the truth and the whole truth, between "a full record of the press variants" and a full record of the surviving press variants. 77 This is not just a quibble. Traditionally the stages of proof-correction have been at least three: galley (whether page- or slip-), revises, and, as a last resort, stop-press. And let us not forget that the manuscript copy precedes all three. Now it is incontestable that these several stages can be found in increasing frequency as one moves from manuscript (how much of that survives?), to page-proofs (very few of these), to revises (slightly more of these — if some of our surviving 'proof' sheets can be so considered), to stop-press (hundreds of these). Each successive stage supersedes the previous one; once the unique copy has been set and checked, it can be disposed of, once the single galley proof has been read and checked, it can be disposed of, once the revise has been read and checked, it can be disposed of, but once printing has started, the multiple copies are preserved and of course they are available for consultation in those portions of the edition still extant. It only remains to note that the principle of increasing frequency persists even here, for, as Professor Hinman has observed in the case of the Folio, the earlier 'uncorrected' state is likely to be preserved in about ten per cent of copies, and the later and latest, press-corrected, states in ninety per cent of surviving copies; these last therefore will be the ones most frequently observed. We must of course work from what we have to what we have not, but our chances of going the full distance and thereby establishing 'a full record of the press variants' — if these are taken to include all stages of proofing — are very remote indeed. When such evidence (of its very nature) demanded to be discarded, it is difficult to see why one should assume that it never existed. 78 But one may consider the point in another way: it is easy after repeated and intense scrutiny to discover 'obvious' misprints, and it is also very easy to miss them. Each year I put some four or five senior and intelligent students through the rudiments of type-setting and when they come to correct their work they almost invariably have to do it in two or three stages because these latter-day John Leasons have failed to correct all the 'obvious' errors the first time through. Yet there was a first time (see Printing and Proof-Reading , I, 233). It is true that the more experienced students make fewer mistakes, but it is again remarkable how many of these mistakes my latter-day John Shakespeares overlook in their first attempt at correction. Much the same point is made of course by Professor Hinman when speaking of sections of plays set by Compositor E, sections "which were subjected to much more proof-reading than others — yet only to very careless proof-reading, since a great many errors nonetheless escaped uncorrected in these plays" (I, 233). Errors, that is, persist through one or more stages of proof-reading; the much-proofed page from Antony and Cleopatra leaves errors uncorrected. 79 The existence of some formes in three or more states indicates that at one or more stages of correction errors were missed which were later thought serious enough to alter. Greg's list of misprints in Q1 Lear , based on the corrected state of the sheets and therefore taking no account of the original errors that were subsequently altered, is most revealing in this connection ( Variants , pp. 63-79). Professor Hinman's new evidence from variants introduced at a relatively late stage of the Folio's production does not dispose of Greg's judgement. The 'obvious errors' have been there since 1623 and Greg, who had as good an eye for them as anyone, still thought that "the printer was not indifferent to the accuracy of his text", and that "he took what were thought in his day to be reasonable precautions, and went to some trouble, to reach a moderate standard in the execution of what may not have been at all times an easy task" ( Shakespeare First Folio , p. 464). There is of course another way of looking at the problem — and I must repeat that I am really only concerned with questions of method and that like Troubleall I merely wish to ask 'by what warrant' certain inferences are given the standing of general statements. So, a priori , one might ask whether it is likely that the essentially trivial corrections noted by Professor Hinman would have been made at all if the printer were indifferent to the accuracy of his text? Or, to put it yet another way, is it likely that a printer who put up with so many bibliographically serious delays at press in order to correct minor blemishes would fail to observe routine correction procedures in order to avoid major infidelities and the prospect of really serious delays in the last stages of production? Which brings us back to Moxon. It is not I hope gratuitously irresponsible to suggest that none of the evidence presented from the Folio demonstrates conclusively that the procedures which Moxon describes were 'essentially different' from those of the 1620's. At the very least, the " Proofe , and Reuiewes " pulled by Jaggard for Brooke's Catalogue testify to the currency of Moxon's terms at this time, and in Jaggard's shop (McKerrow, Introduction , p. 207). We must grant that the copy for the Folio has disappeared; we must grant that the foul proofs have disappeared; but what does remain in evidence corresponds exactly to that which we should expect to find at the later stages of correction as outlined by Moxon. And it is precisely at these stages of correction that copy is not consulted. That phase is well behind, and even if some errors have persisted it is not to be expected that substantive matters will now command 'painstaking' attention. But it is to be expected that typographical infelicities — the things that catch (and for long curiously avoid) a pressman's eye through the repeated pullings — will be picked up from time to time. Turned letters, lifting spaces, uneven inking, badly defective letters — these are precisely the things which at this stage the beater, who "peruses the Heap " ( Mechanick Exercises , p. 292), was deputed to look for. He takes care to see if no accidents have befallen the Form , viz. that no Letters , Quadrats or Furniture &amp;c. Rise, that no Letters are Batter'd . . . that no Pick be got into the Form , or any other accident that may deface the beauty of the Work . . . (p. 303) Rising letters, quadrats and furniture, and probably loose spacing, are fixed by the pressman, who has a bodkin for the purpose; but if letters are to be replaced, "he Unlocks the Quarter they are in, and desires the Compositer to put in others in their room" (p. 304). None of this is inconsistent with what we find in the Folio; indeed Professor Hinman's variants are clear evidence that Jaggard's beater was doing exactly what Moxon demands — turning out a book that was not marred by too many purely typographical blemishes. Let us now recall too what Moxon says of revises and of correction at press: the forme, being now on the bed of the press, is left there , "and if any Faults are found in any Quarter of it [the Compositor] calls to the Press-man to Unlock that Quarter . . . that he may Correct those Faults " (pp. 238-9). There are several points here: the kind of corrections documented for the Folio are unlikely to have required removal of the forme from the press. At this stage, even after as many as three proofs, a revise is pulled — but now the forme is virtually ready for printing and the likelihood is great that printing will begin while the revise is being looked at. The single copy of the revise is likely to be a pull of the full forme; in the case of the white-paper forme its chances of being preserved are negligible, but in the case of the perfecting forme this single marked sheet has a greater chance of being placed on the heap and eventually bound. Although the revise will be of the full forme, Moxon suggests that it might be attended to in sections, or quarters, so that the pressman might unlock only so much of the forme as is necessary, perhaps only a page in the case of the Folio. In many cases in the Folio both pages must have been unlocked and corrected together, yet Moxon's wording does hint that the revise itself might be read in sections. I find it most interesting therefore that Professor Hinman should write: "Four actual proof-sheets for the Folio have survived — although . . . they ought perhaps rather to be called proof pages "; and "the essential proof-reading unit, so to speak, was rather the single page than the complete forme" ( Printing and Proof-Reading , I, 233, 234). I wonder, however, whether these four proof pages should not perhaps be referred to as revises to distinguish them from the first and substantial stage of correction as well as from the last and accidental one. In any case, however cursory we may think the Folio by our own standards and in the absence of author-correction, it would seem premature to conclude that what so closely corresponds to revises and stoppress correction as described by Moxon was not preceded by the routine proofing procedures which he also outlines. These may have been deficient in execution, but I cannot think that Professor Hinman's inferences justify the view that "the method of printing and proofing adopted", whether in the Folio or beyond it in the earlier 17th century, "was essentially different . . . from the method described by Moxon some sixty years later" (I, 228). Professor Hinman, in another context, also discounts the testimony of Ashley's translation of Le Roy (1594), "since Le Roy was not a professional printer" (I, 41). Ashley writes of the pressman who is pulling: taking the barre in his hand, he pulleth as hard as he can vntill the leafe be imprinted on one side, on which they bestowe halfe the day; and the other halfe, on the other side; yelding in a day twelue hundred and fiftie sheetes, or thirteen hundred imprinted. But before they do this, they make two or three proofes, which are reuiewed: and on this correction continew the rest. 80 The late Mr Kenneth Povey found reason to believe that Ashley had expert help in making his translation; and it may be further noted that Jaggard's precise use of the word " Reuiewes ", both as a noun and as a verb in the phrase "viewed, reuiewed, directed, corrected", suggests that Ashley's use of the word "reuiewed" was not idle. Ashley is at one with both Jaggard and Moxon in suggesting that, first, there might be two or three proofs and, next, a 'reuiew' or revise. Even the phrase "continew the rest" could relate to a process of continuous printing, stopped to make the late changes found in the revise, and then resumed. Mr Povey used Allde's 1624 edition of Massinger's The Bond-man as a test case, and found all the variants reconcilable with an orderly routine of proof-correcting and perfecting described by Moxon. He suggested, moreover, that since Ashley's concise account is fully confirmed by Moxon, it might well be adopted as the credo of students of Elizabethan printing-methods in preference to any modern construction (p. 43). Nowhere perhaps so much as in the consideration of skeleton formes and proof-correction procedures are modern constructions so crippled by the absence of primary evidence and so vulnerable therefore to the general objections that may be made to all inductive methods. One recalls Black: "a nice adaptation of conditions will make almost any hypothesis agree with the phenomena." It is doubly a pity, however, when writers adapt conditions to suit their theories and then find themselves obliged to discount the testimony of such an excellent palmer as Moxon. But much the same may be said of many studies of 18th-century printing which have been conducted on the assumption that conditions then were essentially different from those of the preceding century. My own major argument in this paper is of course that productive conditions were constantly changing, not just from century to century in different houses, but from day to day in the same house, simply because concurrent printing has been the universal practice for the last 400 years. If I am right, this fundamental fact poses more problems for analytical bibliography than any minor period differences. These there certainly were, and they must be carefully charted, but we must beware of that ostensibly sophisticated historical relativism which insists on making fine distinctions between periods when virtually nothing certain is known about either element of the comparison. When, for example, Professor Todd writes that whenever books contain press figures their very presence implies unsystematic piecework engaged in conjunction with other miscellaneous endeavours. For labour which is predetermined, controlled, and properly recorded by the overseer . . . the figures become superfluous and accordingly disappear ("Concurrent Printing", p. 56). the implication is that we are here dealing with quite distinctive conditions; but this, as the song says, ain't necessarily so. Whatever the variables, labour was always predetermined, controlled, and properly recorded, whether on piece rates or not. Crownfield's disposition of work, usually without figures, was no different from the Bowyers' with figures, and Stower's "Plan of a Book for checking Compositors' and Pressmen's Bills" assumes exactly the same conditions a hundred years later when press figures are on their way out ( Printer's Grammar , p. 435). The procedures have always been the same — only the methods of recording them have differed. I cannot here attempt to describe the thick web of theory spun around press figures. 81 In their incredible and perplexing variety they are eloquent witnesses to the customary conditions of presswork in any printing house, and perhaps only an imagination as fertile as Professor Todd's, and a mind as subtle, could have penetrated their mysteries. On their usefulness, let him speak: Contrary to McKerrow's prediction that [press figures] would prove to be of little importance, recent investigation has shown that they may be interpreted as signs of cancellation, variant states, half- or full-press operation (indicating the employment of one or two men at the machine), type pages arranged within the forme in some irregular pattern, sheets impressed in some abnormal order, an impression of the formes for each sheet by one man working both formes in succession, or two men working both simultaneously, impressions interrupted for one reason or another, reimpressions or resettings of the book, in whole or in part, copy distributed among several shops, overprints involving an increase in the number of sheets machined for certain gatherings in order to meet an unanticipated demand for copies, and underprints consisting of a decrease in the number of sheets in order to reduce the issue and speed its publication ("Editorial Problem in the Eighteenth Century", p. 47). Much bibliographical writing, like that in any new subject, has a strong proselytizing strain which is apt to show itself in a slight tendency to rhetorical overstatement and the premature elevation of particular observations to the status of general truths. One or two pieces of information that have become available since Professor Todd wrote the above account do call for its qualification; I present them now only to carry forward my general argument that the 'empirical' method, with its reliance on 'direct observation', 82 might lead us wildly astray. Press figures, as Professor Todd has indubitably shown, are of enormous value in revealing conditions normally concealed, but they still need theories to make them work and the theories so far applied have been largely without benefit of primary evidence from the printing house itself. As I have indicated elsewhere, Cambridge pressmen in the early 18th century did not normally use press figures, and the first two volumes of Suidas are the only two books of the period in which they appear ( Cambridge University Press , I, 128-32). This exception is wholly due to the employment of John Terrill who came up from London towards the end of November 1701 and who left Cambridge again on 15 May 1703. Terrill's bills for presswork match the figures exactly and make it perfectly clear that, in this case, the figures represent a man, specifically Terrill, not a press. Terrill did not always use a figure, nor keep to the same one; and it is certain that here in the Cambridge house his use of a figure was a purely personal and optional matter. His main reason for using one at all would seem to have been that the first two volumes of Suidas were being printed concurrently and as they were independently signed 'Suidas the quire G' or 'Suidas G1' might refer to either or both volumes. So Terrill played safe by marking the sheets that he printed, although he thought it necessary to figure only one forme in each sheet. In this, his practice was consistent with that recommended by Savage in 1841 but not with that followed by the Bowyers in the 1730's. 83 Terrill's main concern seems to have been merely to use some idiosyncratic mark, and once the work had been paid for any other might serve as well. It is not surprising therefore to discover that Terrill used two different figures (* and ‡) in both volumes. The first (*) was used between the end of November 1701 and 28 Feb. 1702; during this period Terrill worked under markedly different conditions at different times — first with Brown at full press and then alone at half press — yet he used the same figure throughout. From 28 Feb. until 2 May 1702 he worked with Ponder without a figure. Thereafter, until his departure on 15 May 1703, Terrill used the second figure (‡), again in both volumes, to mark almost every sheet on which he worked. When he left, the figure disappeared. Clearly the consistent use of one figure in one part of a book and of another figure in another part has in this case nothing whatever to do with simultaneous — or even successive — printing of each portion at different presses. Nor has the incidence of variously figured and unfigured sheets anything whatever to do with printing at full or at half press. If, even occasionally, a pressman was personally responsible for his choice of figure, as here, this would go far to account for the many idiosyncratic numbers or marks adopted in some books and their apparently haphazard arrangement. And if, even occasionally, a figure represents a man rather than a press, it is formally possible to argue that a sheet which shows varying figures in copy to copy simply reflects changes in the press-crew part-way through a single impression and not distinct impressions. Indeed, whether a figure indicates a pressman or a press, such variation is in any case to be expected in books printed in very large editions. The London Magazine , for example, was printed for a time in 8000 copies. Since it comprised three and a half sheets, its printing would have kept three full presses wholly engaged for more than a week. Over such a time span — longer if the presses were required to do other work too, as Ackers' were — it is highly probable that changes would occur in the conditions under which the single impression would be completed. Changes of men, as well as changes of press, part-way through printing might well be reflected by new figures yet none of them be bibliographically significant — or at least no more bibliographically significant than the daily discontinuities incident to all printing in large editions. Naturally such evidence would rarely be left to stand alone; at the very least it would set one searching for new skeletons, partial re-settings, advertisements and so on; my point is the quite simple one that the relationship between variant states and distinct impressions must be very carefully assessed if the general conditions of work are not to be misrepresented. But, as Dr Fleeman has already shown, there is quite conclusive evidence in the Bowyer ledger to associate press figures with a press not a man, evidence which can be corroborated by reference to the printed books themselves. 84 Bowyer numbered his presses and his accounts usually show, by their numbers and crews, the presses at which work was done. If a press-crew had a press of its own at which it regularly worked — and there is some evidence that this was so in Cambridge in 1740 — then the distinction between men and machines would virtually disappear; 85 but the Bowyer papers offer us no such simple resolution. In the examples of Bowyer books listed in appendix II (g), the figures and/or presses and/or crews can be lined up with a certitude unparalleled in any purely inferential construction. Yet it is most important to note, first, how many discrepancies there are between the records and the printed figures (especially in No. 5); second, the difficulty of assuming continuity of press-crews for any one figure; third, the irrelevance of the highest figure printed, although it designates a press, to the actual number of presses in use; fourth, that the occasional failures to figure a forme are in fact oversights and do not represent work done at a notionally blank press. It is another example of the by now familiar paradox: primary evidence definitely restricts the generality of many statements hitherto made about the interpretation of press figures; yet it reveals such diversity of conditions in their use that almost any answer might well be true for any particular book. It is another warning that, as Professor Todd has put it, "any theory envisaging a uniform procedure in an unorganized, laissez-faire handicraft must be regarded with suspicion" ("Observations on Press Figures", p. 173). When therefore the writer of a review article in the Times Literary Supplement took Mrs Russell to task for not adequately listing press figures in her bibliography of Cowper, and suggested that the printers of certain editions might be identified by the pattern of press figures, or that because the figures 3 and 6 recur in Bensley's editions of Cowper these editions were always placed in the care of the same pressmen, the arguments may be much less 'advanced' than they seem. 86 In the light of complexities discovered by any primary documentation so far unearthed, such an ostensibly direct frontal assault turns out to be no more than a rear-guard action in defence of a much too simplistic and now obsolescent bibliographical method.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV I should not wish to deny that significant changes occurred in printing and publishing between the years 1500 and 1800; but on two counts I wish to offer some resistance to the evasive tactics of those who would for their part deny the relevance of conditions in any one period to those in another. Of course 1586 is not 1623, nor 1683, 1695, 1701, 1731, nor 1790. Yet just as Greg has argued that bibliography, as the study of the transmission of literary texts, comprehends manuscripts as well as printed books, so I wish to argue that the integrity of the subject can best be preserved and a sound methodology evolved only if we stress the similarity of conditions in all periods. Then fine distinctions may be entertained, not as period differences but as the inevitable result of variables which will differ from day to day and house to house. My second reason for resisting the too ready rejection of analogy is that very little fundamental research has been done on the history of printing. History is never so gross as when it's being formulated to serve a theory; and bibliographers with their eyes closest to the internal physical evidence have, on the whole, seen least of what lies beyond it. The familiar picture of 'Elizabethan' printers, restricted in number, presses, edition quantities, and apprentices, and therefore constantly under pressure, and operating an essentially uncomplicated, balanced production schedule, is attractive in its simplicity. But in its generalized form such a picture is also apt to be dangerously misleading. Simpson, discussing the limitation of presses, once wrote that "When a printer with at most two presses had a book on the stocks, he could do nothing else until he had printed it off." 87 Such a view, so stated, now seems extremely naive, although something like it is implied in many studies even today. The documentation that exists for a shop of comparable size in 1700, printing books in editions no larger than those permitted in 1587, makes it clear that productive conditions of enormous complexity involving as many as ten or a dozen jobs at any one time were normal in a small two-press house. But even the size of 'Elizabethan' shops has perhaps been a little too readily set at one or two presses, and the 'strict limitation' on their numbers over-stressed. The evidence would appear to be straightforward, but is it? Were there really too few printers and presses for the work available, or too many? In 1582, at a time of complaints from journeymen about lack of work, Christopher Barker said that the number of printing houses then in London (22) could be more than halved and the needs of the whole kingdom still met. 88 In 1583 the complaint of the 'poor men' of the Company was that they had too little work, and Commissioners appointed to look into the trade recommended that some privileged books be released to the poor for printing, a practice continued by the several Stocks of the Stationers' Company throughout the 17th century to assist printers who were short of work (Greg, Companion , pp. 21, 128). In May 1583 there were 23 master printers, possessing in all 53 presses: Barker had 5, Wolf 5, Day and Denham 4 each, and six others 3 apiece. 89 Although the Commissioners of 1583 recommended that no more presses be set up without license, their recommendation in respect of the existing presses was simply That euerie printer keping presses be restrained to a reasonable nomber of presses according to his qualitie and store of worke, as for example the the Quenes printer hauing but .v. presses, and the lawe printer but twoo, we think it not reason that Wolf haue .v. but to restraine him and such other to one or two by discretion till his stoare of worke shall require moe (Greg, Companion , p. 131). Could anything more permissive be desired? The Star Chamber decree of 1586 forbade the erection of new presses "tyll the excessive multytude of Prynters havinge presses already sett up, be abated" (Greg, Companion , p. 41). A statement of the position the following month shows that the number of printers had risen to 25 and that Barker had increased the number of his presses to 6 (Arber, Transcript , V, lii). Apart from isolated cases of surreptitious printing punished by seizure of equipment, and apart from the normal licensing of those who succeeded to the select company of master printers, there is nothing to show how this positive abatement in the number of presses was procured. For the next twenty-nine years, there is little primary evidence at all to show in what measure the conditions of 1586 had ceased to apply. Indeed, apart from the recurrent fuss over privileges, there is evidence of a general relaxation. When in 1613-15 the unemployed journeymen again complained about their inability to set up presses, they saw that a necessary condition of such a freedom would be access to privileged copies — otherwise there would be little work. 90 The master printers for their part were worried, or made a pretence of being so, at the "multitude of Presses that are erected among them" and by a self-denying ordinance agreed that, the King's Printer apart, fourteen of them should have 2 presses each and five of them 1. 91 Since the number of printers was 20 in all, such a rule can only mean that many of them had retained from a much earlier period, or set up over the last few years, far more presses than the numbers now set down. And since the number of printers did remain fairly constant, the agreement can only have been designed to secure a slightly more equitable distribution of work among these very printers; it implied, therefore, considerable under -production in the smaller shops. Are we to take it that this decision by the Court of Assistants was immediately enforced? There is no evidence of it. Eight years later , on 5 July 1623, Whereas the m r printers of this Company, according to a former order haue reformed themselues for the number of presses that eueryone is to haue and accordingly haue brought in their barres to shewe their Conformitie therevnto. . . (Jackson, p. 158). again it is set down down that, the King's Printer excluded, fourteen printers should have only 2 presses each and five of them 1. Augustine Matthews was one of these five, but it is clear from another entry that he had more than one press (Jackson, p. 159). By September the following year the order had still not been put into effect and an inspectorial party was authorized to dismantle any excess presses. 92 By 7 Feb. 1625 the Court was prepared to give up: It is ordered that if the m r Printers doe not Conforme themselues to the number of presses as hath ben agreed of by former orders and bring in their barres before o r ladye day next, Then those that are already brought in to be deliu'ed backe againe [my italics] (Jackson, p. 173). In 1637, after being restricted to one press ever since 1586, the Cambridge printer was graciously allowed a second. When in 1632 Roger Daniel had moved in he took over: Six printing presses, five copper plates, six bankes, seven great stones, one muller, thirteen frames to set cases on . . . six and fifty paire and an halfe of cases for letters made of mettle and one case for wooden letters, five and twenty chases, twenty gallies, fifty paper and letter bords, . . . (Roberts, p. 50). The Star Chamber decree of 1637, reporting that of 1586 as defective in some particulars so that divers abuses had arisen to the prejudice of the public, attempted to keep the number of master printers down to 20 (there were 22), but the number of presses, always more difficult to restrict, was allowed to rise (Greg, Companion , p. 105). By 1649 there were apparently some 60 printers in London and by 1660 the number had increased to 70, though it is doubtful whether there were so many printing houses. The Licensing Act of 1662 provided that no more printers be licensed until the number had fallen again to 20, but nothing was done to enforce the ruling and for the next thirty years it was openly ignored. 93 In 1668, after the great fire, there were 65 presses in 26 houses, the King's Printer having 6, two others 5 each, another 4, seven had 3, nine had 2, and six had 1. 94 Negus in 1724 listed 75 London houses and 28 in the provinces. Mr Ellic Howe comments: "There was, therefore, no great expansion in the trade compared with its state seventy years previously" ( London Compositor , p. 33). By 1785 there were 124 printers; in 1808 "not more than 130", although Stower in the same year listed 216; by 1818 the total in London was 233. 95 All I wish to ask now is whether there is much conclusive evidence that 'Elizabethan' conditions in any one printing house were utterly distinctive from those common in the 18th century? Expansion of the trade there undoubtedly was but except in a very few cases (Watts in the 1720's, Bowyer, Richardson and Strahan mid-century — a half dozen at most out of upwards of a hundred?) what we get in the 18th century is proliferation, multiple establishments, not an exceptional growth in any one. The fundamental conditions of work in each remain unchanged. Or again, if it is urged that the multi-press shops of the 18th century have few parallels in the early 17th century, one is entitled to ask quite directly how Ackers' and the Bowyers' three-, four-, and five-press shops of the 1730's differ from those of Barker, Wolf, Day, Denham, all of whom had more than three presses, and the other six printers who in 1583 had three presses each. Or one might ask how significantly, in terms of size, either group differs from those listed in 1668 (eleven of whom had three or more presses). And even if it is conceded that none of the printers limited to two presses in 1615 and 1623 would have grossly exceeded this number, a certain scepticism is still permissible since there is no evidence at all that they conformed to the ruling and much that they refused to. Or take the question the other way round: grant for the moment that most Elizabethan shops were two-press or one-press houses; it may then be asked what the distribution of presses was within 18th-century houses. How many had two, how many had only one? In the second week of October 1732 even Bowyer had only two (See appendix II (f).). For the rest, no one knows, and even press figures may not tell us. Is the problem any simpler if we look at edition quantities? It is true that these were limited by regulation in Elizabethan-Jacobean times and not in the 18th century. Yet two points must be kept in mind. First, very few books printed in the 18th century, apart from some newspapers and periodicals about which some firm figures are at last available, ever in fact exceeded the limits for editions laid down in 1587 and liberalized in 1637. Neither the Cambridge, Bowyer, Woodfall, nor Strahan documents suggest that for any one edition, however many impressions it might comprehend, there is any very gross disparity between Elizabethan and 18th-century conditions in this matter. Out of some 514 books printed by Strahan between 1738 and 1785, only 43 were printed in 2000 copies or more, and of these only 15 were in editions of 3000 or more (Hernlund, "Strahan's Ledgers", p. 104). The edition quantities I cite for Dyche's Guide to the English Tongue may be more in keeping with some statements I have seen about expansion of the trade in the 18th century — and with others implying trade restriction and small editions in the 17th century. In any case it leads me to my second point: the prodigious numbers of certain books that were produced in the earlier period. Professor Todd once remarked that "a certain discretion common to most authorities, including bibliographers, moves us to view the unknown as unmentionable". And the loss of much ephemera of the 16th and 17th centuries (almanacks, school texts, and many other books required in multiple editions by the several Stocks of the Stationers' Company) has perhaps made us unmindful of the volume of such work. The late Cyprian Blagden's analysis of the distribution of almanacks in the second half of the 17th century, only one aspect of such printing, is a useful corrective. 96 For the earlier period odd cases reveal substantial printings: the 4000 copies of the Psalms in metre, for example, printed by Frank and Hill in 1585; the 10,000 copies of the ABC and Little Catechism printed the same year by Dunn and Robinson (Greg, Companion , p. 37). In three years, during the early 1630's the Cambridge printers provided for the London Company 18,000 Pueriles Sententiae , 12,000 Aesop's Fables , 6000 Pueriles Confabulationes , 6000 copies of Mantuan, and at least seven other books in 3000 copies or more (Roberts, p. 51). But the major evidence of large editions, far in excess presumably of the limits set, is the complaints from journeymen. The Company regulations of 1587, designed for the benefit of the journeymen, sought to provide further work by restricting the use of standing formes and by limiting impressions to 1500 copies of some books and 3000 of others (Greg, Companion , p. 43). These were of course Company regulations enforced, if at all, by those least likely to gain from them. The workmen are further complaining in 1614, and in 1635 an organized protest is made about the extraordinary number of books printed at one impression and the abuse of standing formes. The alleviation of the journeymen's distress may have been procured by the restriction of standing formes to the Psalter, Grammar and Accidence, Almanacks and Prognostications, but one doubts it. 97 The 1635 provision that no nonpareil books exceed 5000 copies, no brevier exceed 3000 (6000 in some cases), and that all others be kept to editions of 1500 or 2000 (3000 with permission), suggests that multiple impressions and large editions were hardly the prerogative of the 18th century (Greg, Companion , p. 95). Professor Todd has probably done most to set the general attitude towards 18th-century printing and thereby also to imply that conditions in the earlier periods were considerably different. He writes: [Eighteenth-century books] are the products of conditions of greater complexity than those which apply to earlier periods, and therefore occasionally require supplemental techniques for their analysis. It has not been sufficiently realized that printing, in this century, has progressed beyond the era of the simple handicraft and now represents one of mass production, where not a few but hundreds of pages of type may be retained and repeatedly returned to press, where not one or two individuals but batteries of pressmen and compositors may produce, in a matter of hours, editions running into thousands of copies, where not one but several books may be put to press concurrently by the same personnel. These practices, though extraordinary in the seventeenth century have become commonplace in the eighteenth . . . ("Editorial Problem in the Eighteenth Century", p. 46). And elsewhere: Before the expiration of the Licensing Act in 1695 the process of book-making was undoubtedly less confused than afterwards: only thirty-five master printers were authorized to practise the trade, and most of these, we may be sure, conformed to the regulation limiting the number of presses and apprentices for each shop. . . . After 1695, though, the conditions for disorder increase in approximately the same ratio as the means for detecting it disappear ("Observations on Press Figures", p. 179). Professor Todd is undoubtedly right that some 18th-century books are the products of conditions of greater complexity: any increase in size will increase the number of variables. Undoubtedly too in the largest houses a good deal of type was kept standing, although it would be interesting to go into the economics of such a practice. For the rest, the case for any really radical difference between the centuries would seem to have been over-stated. Perhaps a fine historical exactitude will be possible when more primary documentation has been published and some serious thought given to its economic implications.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose . It's the only way I can explain the central paradox of this paper: that all printing houses were alike in being different. Despite my misgivings about 'norms' I have tried to suggest that all printing houses were more alike over the years than many bibliographers are prepared to allow: in size of plant, variability of work force, edition quantities printed, use of standing formes, proofing procedures, and most important of all in printing several jobs concurrently. I have stressed the supreme importance of primary evidence and I have tried to use it to expose and curb what I take to be erroneous inferences. In doing so, I have also tried to demonstrate more generally some weaknesses inherent in the inductive method. When the standing of general statements is damaged by contrary examples, the inductivist usually seeks a safe retreat in some form of historical relativism; I have tried to show how naive this can be. I am sure that Professor Hinman is right, though my sense pursues not his, when he stresses the importance of the new knowledge which will come "in the light of information about printing-house personnel and printing-house methods that is only now becoming known" ("Shakespeare's Texts", p. 26). Bright lights will cast deep shadows, and I must confess to a feeling of mild despondency about the prospects for analytical bibliography: limited demonstrations there may certainly be, although they may require a life-time's devotion to make them; wherever full primary evidence has become available it has revealed a geometry of such complexity that even an expert in cybernetics, primed with all the facts, would have little chance of discerning it. But, as Nestor says, "In the reproof of Chance lies the true proof of men". Bibliography will simply have to prove itself adequate to conditions of far greater complexity than it has hitherto entertained. To do so, it will inevitably be obliged to use multiple and ingenious hypotheses, to move from induction to deduction, simply because a narrow range of theories is less likely to embrace the complex possibilities of organization within even a quite small printing house. A cynic might observe that the subject is already characterized by multiple and ingenious hypotheses, but too many of these have been allowed to harden into 'truth'. A franker acceptance of deductive procedures would bring a healthy critical spirit into the subject by insisting on the rigorous testing of hypotheses, and the prime method of falsification — adducing contrary particulars — would impose a sound curb on premature generalizations. It may be little pleasure "to observe how much paper is wasted in confutation", but bibliography might grow the more securely if we retained a stronger assurance of its hypothetical nature. There is, however, a final paradox. Bibliography has nothing to do with bibliographies, and I only hope that new knowledge about productive conditions will prove disturbing enough to widen the gap between the two. The essential task of the bibliographer is to establish the facts of transmission for a particular text, and he will use all relevant evidence to determine the bibliographical truth. Author and subject bibliographies have a completely different function and it would be preposterous now to demand of them any great bibliographical sophistication. This would appear to be an argument in favour of degressive bibliography. Not at all; the phrase is meaningless. Booklisting may be as degressive as it wishes, bibliography never. Greg made the point so clearly that it's surprising to find that there is still any fuss about it; if any notice had been taken, we should have less half-baked bibliography and cheaper book-lists. 98 But finally, if our basic premise is that bibliography should serve literature or the criticism of literature, it may be thought to do this best, not by disappearing into its own minutiae, but by pursuing the study of printing history to the point where analysis can usefully begin, or by returning — and this is the paradox — to the more directly useful, if less sophisticated, activity of enumerative 'bibliography'. This it is which gave us the Pollard and Redgrave and Wing S.T.C. s, both of which have been of inestimable service to the study of history, life, thought — and bibliography — in the 16th and 17th centuries. It will be a pity if history, life, thought — and bibliography — in the 18th century are long deprived of a comparable service. Note to the appendices : The information offered in the following appendices is intended merely to provide supporting evidence for the argument of this paper. It is not offered as a contribution to the detailed bibliographical study of either the books or the printing houses mentioned in it. The original documents referring to the Cambridge University Press are printed in my Cambridge University Press , 1696-1712: A Bibliographical Study (1966): the two charts printed here continue those given as Table 15 in that book. The details of the Bowyer printing house are taken from the Bowyers' record of composition and presswork over the years 1730 to 1739; the volume in which this work is recorded is in the possession of The Grolier Club and is being edited for publication by Mr Keith Maslen. An edition of the ledger of Charles Ackers, printer of The London Magazine , was recently published by the Oxford Bibliographical Society. The appendices are long, but I have deliberately multiplied the examples to illustrate fully the variety of conditions under which the books mentioned came to be made, by different men, at different periods, and in different places.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes * This paper was originally given in a very much shorter form as a lecture at the University of Illinois, the University of Virginia, and the University of California (Los Angeles) in May 1963. In revising it I have tried to take account of more recent work but I am very conscious of the injustices I am doubtless doing to those whom I quote out of context. May I plead lack of space and offer the reflection that although methodological discussion has a way of seeming unfair to those criticised, it's only a form of intellectual house-keeping, dependent upon and tributary to the greater work of others? Mottos for the day might be: "Profound truths are not to be expected of methodology" (Sir Karl Popper) and "Methodology is at best a shortcut for the inexperienced" (R. C. Bald). 1 Textual and Literary Criticism (1959), p. 115. 2 Quoted at p. 82 of The Logic of Scientific Discovery (Harper Torchbook edition, 1965). 3 Bibliographers' use of the word may be consulted at the following points: W. W. Greg, Collected Papers , ed. J. C. Maxwell (1966), pp. 76, 220-3; R. B. McKerrow, Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare (1939), pp. vi-viii; R. C. Bald, "Evidence and Inference in Bibliography," reprinted in A Mirror for Modern Scholars , ed. Lester A. Beaurline (1966), pp. 2-3; Fredson Bowers, On Editing Shakespeare (1955), pp. 41, 95, 99, 124; Textual and Literary Criticism , pp. 70, 81, 96, 100-1, 115; Bibliography and Textual Criticism (1964), pp. 72, 74, 90; J. Hazel Smith, "The Composition of the Quarto of Much Ado about Nothing, " SB , XVI (1963), 10. 4 Treatise of Human Nature, Book I, part iii, sec. 12. 5 The point is neatly made by Robert K. Turner, "Reappearing Types as Bibliographical Evidence," SB , XIX (1966), 198: "hypothesis is essential to observation." Professor Hinman has a relevant paragraph: "When I first learned from the indisputable evidence furnished by individual types that the Folio was indeed set throughout by formes rather than by successive pages, I was probably as much surprised as anyone else. But should I have been? To prove setting by formes required evidence not adduced before; but not to have suspected it sooner was to have failed to see facts — or at least the probable implications of a complex of related facts — that had long been staring us all in the face, so to speak." The point is made "in order to suggest a not unimportant general principle of bibliographical investigation" — Printing and Proof-Reading of the Shakespeare First Folio (1963), I, 50-51. 6 The difficulties created by limited criteria are indicated by Antonin Hruby in "A Quantitative Solution to the Ambiguity of Three Texts," SB , XVIII (1965), 153-4; and Professor Bowers warns of the inadequacy and dangers of inferential arguments in "Some Relations of Bibliography to Editorial Problems," SB , III (1950), 54, 57. Professor Bowers' most thorough and challenging investigation of the problem is offered in chapter III of Bibliography and Textual Criticism . He suggests three orders of certainty, "the demonstrable, the probable, and the possible" (p. 77), and stresses the importance of "the postulate of normality" as a necessary curb on the number of plausible conjectures that human ingenuity might otherwise devise (pp. 64, 70, 72). See also Hinman, "The Prentice Hand in the Tragedies of the Shakespeare First Folio: Compositor E," SB , IX (1957), 3. 7 Professor Bowers remarks: "No one can argue that we know all about the printing processes of the past, and it is just as obvious from time to time this postulate of normality has fostered incorrect explanations based on imperfect evidence." ( Bibliography and Textual Criticism , p. 72). The cautionary note is justified, not because the elementary physical actions of setting, transferring, imposing, inking, proofing, printing from, or distributing type differed from century to century, nor even because the kinds of work and sizes of shops differed, but because the amount of work done and the relations between those performing it differed from day to day. "Normality" in one sense is limited, though within its limitations valuable; in the other sense it doesn't exist. 8 "The subject as practised": it could be urged that no science is a disembodied activity, but only the activities of its practitioners, and that it is defined less by its body of commonly accepted knowledge than by the dynamics of difference. Robert K. Turner's "The Composition of the Insatiate Countess Q2," SB , XII (1958), 198-203, for example, does not offer mechanical demonstration and proof from the physical and inexorable evidence of the printing house so much as a proliferation of unrelated, arbitrary hypotheses to explain away inconsistencies. 9 May I recall what Greg said of Professor Dover Wilson? "He is of imagination all compact. And imagination, I would remind you, is the highest gift in scientific investigation, even if at times it may be the deepest pitfall." ( Collected Papers , p. 217). I have myself a pleasant recollection of meeting Professor Dover Wilson in May 1958. "I always believe," he said, "that if you have a good idea you should send it out into the world. If it survives, fine. If it doesn't, then at least you know it's wrong." The serious implications of that last phrase are only now beginning to dawn on me. 10 The primary records are printed in volume II of my Cambridge University Press, 1696-1712 (1966). 11 AUMLA (May, 1967), p. 109.

Fleeman's discovery of the Bowyer ledger was reported in The Times Literary Supplement , 19 Dec. 1963, p. 1056, and some of its details were put to use in his note "William Somervile's 'The Chace,' 1735," PBSA , LVIII (1966), 1-7. 12 Professor Hinman conveniently summarizes the evidence and offers some very careful qualifications of it in Printing and Proof-Reading I, 39-47. Although his method and purposes must in fact assume a norm, he is quite clear about the foolishness of trying to pretend that there may not have been considerable variation from it (cf. I, 46). 13 I must express my gratitude to Dr Léon Voet, Curator of the Plantin-Moretus Museum for supplying me with photocopies of entries from the Mémorial des Ouvriers for the months of Jan.-Mar. 1622. Dr Voet has brought together much valuable information in "The Making of Books in the Renaissance as told by the Archives of the Plantin-Moretus Museum," PaGA , X , no. 2 (Dec. 1965), 33-62. The most relevant Oxford document is a "Bill Book" for the years 1769-72 which I cite by courtesy of the Printer to the University. John Wilson's "Case-Book" was brought to my attention by Miss Frances M. Thomson who is preparing an edition of it. I should also mention Mr Rollo G. Silver's contributions to this journal, especially "Mathew Carey's Printing Equipment," SB , XIX (1966), 85-122, which form a valuable addition to the primary documentation on early printing houses. There is a more general point to be made. Greg, recognizing the level of generality that any respectable discipline must seek, insisted that bibliography comprehend manuscript as well as printed texts. Similarly it might be argued that ancient and modern book production should not be too readily separated. Mr Simon Nowell-Smith has shown in his 1966 Lyell Lectures how more recent books can be usefully (and disturbingly for such concepts as "edition" and "issue") documented from publishers' archives. The growth of such bibliographical work in the modern period will, if the subject is to keep its integrity, enforce a greater realism in discussing the productive conditions for earlier books. 14 For these references see Cambridge University Press I, 89-92, 139-40. 15 E. S. Furniss, The Position of the Laborer in a System of Nationalism (1920), p. 234. Furniss remarks that "The English laborer . . . responded, when prices fell or wages rose, so that he could satisfy his wants with diminished effort, by 'keeping holiday the remainder of his time'." (p. 235). The contemporary evidence cited by Furniss is full and detailed. D.C. Coleman, in "Labour in the English Economy of the 17th Century," Economic History Review , 2nd ser. VIII (1956), 280-95, points out that modern writers have underrated the recurrent problem of unemployment and comments that half-employment was often the rule. He cites Thomas Manly's note of 1669 that "They work so much fewer days by how much the more they exact in wages;" remarks that this was said of "agricultural workers and of industrial, of urban as well as of rural;" and adds "Irregularity of work . . . was not confined to the working week. The working day at one end of the scale, the working year at the other, were both very different from their counterparts in the modern industrialized community" (p. 291). 16 Some Thoughts on the Interest of Money (1728), cited by Furniss. 17 Such an argument was in fact used in litigation in 1592 when Benjamin Prince, a journeyman employed by John Legate, said he need only do what he could whereas Parker, an apprentice, had to do as his master bade him. See "Notes on Printing at Cambridge, c. 1590," Trans. Cambridge Bibliographical Society , III (1959), 102. The whole question of full or partial employment, however, needs to be related to the evidence we have of journeymen's grievances. It may be that under conditions of widespread unemployment an increase in part-time work is to be expected rather than a severe restriction of the labour force to the few men of highest efficiency. 18 Mechanick Exercises , ed. H. Davis and H. Carter (1958), p. 327; see also p. 328 for the phrase "their Contracted Task ." Professor Hinman ( Printing and Proof-Reading , I, 42-45) considers some of the evidence for daily output at press and case (e.g. the Gay-Purslowe contract of 1631, Moxon, Richardson's figures of 1756, and early 19th-century rates for setting). He clearly considers the figures rather high and suggests that they were not consistently attained. I am sure he is right, notwithstanding abundant evidence elsewhere for high press output — see "Notes on Printing at Cambridge," p. 101 n., where a number of references are collected. Testimonies for 1592 claim 2500 impressions as the normal daily amount worked off for 3s.4d. per press-crew. But it is also stated that under the rules of the London Company a pressman was to have his full contracted wages if on any day, by agreement with the master, fewer sheets were printed. Several 19th-century ones could be added, but Blackwell's estimate of 2500 impressions per day, cited by Mr Rollo G. Silver, is among the most important ("Mathew Carey's Printing Equipment," p. 102). The real point, however, is not that these figures were norms, except perhaps for very large edition quantities, but the accepted maxima. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis of extreme variability within the limits indicated, but any "norm" derived from the evidence can be repeatedly falsified and its predictive value thereby seriously impaired. It may be noted that Plantin's pressmen and compositors received differential payments, as did those of Crownfield and Bowyer, for formes of varying difficulty, and in 1592 differential rates applied to presswork according to the size of type. 19 The point about fluctuations in the number of workmen is admirably made, in the case of Plantin, by the charts in Raymond de Roover's "The Business Organization of the Plantin Press in the Setting of Sixteenth Century Antwerp," De Gulden Passer , XXXIV (1956), 104-20. The figures there given show the absolute variations, but in addition the ratios of workmen to presses and of compositors to pressmen may be easily calculated as at January in every year from 1564 to 1589. To take two years: on 4 Jan. 1572 there were 13 presses in use, 23 pressmen, 23 compositors, and 7 other employees; on 2 Jan. 1574 there were 16 presses in use, 32 pressmen, 20 compositors, and 4 other employees. The smaller English shops could not have tolerated this degree of fluctuation, but where the records survive the ratios of compositors to pressmen to presses can be shown to have varied quite markedly. The Cambridge and Bowyer presses illustrate a disturbingly large variance in weekly, monthly and annual levels of production; Strahan's and Charles Ackers' output differed significantly from one year to the next; and the charts given of Oxford printing in F. Madan's The Oxford University Press: a Brief Account (1908), although based only on surviving works, are a graphic corrective to an over-reliance on "norms." I know of no direct evidence that obliges us to exempt Elizabethan and Jacobean printers from such fluctuations, although the legal limitation on the number of printers has tempted some to assume continuous output at maximum levels. There is much evidence that some Elizabethan printers constantly lacked work. 20 Introduction to Bibliography (1928), p. 132. 21 Hinman, "New Uses for Headlines as Bibliographical Evidence," English Institute Annual, 1941 (1942), p. 209. 22 "Notes on Printing at Cambridge," p. 101. See also P. Hernlund, "William Strahan's Ledgers: Standard Charges for Printing, 1738-1785," SB , XX (1967), 89-111, esp. p. 104 where the frequencies of certain edition sizes are given. Professor Hinman notes the folly of setting edition sizes to suit bibliographical equations ( Printing and Proof-Reading , I, 40), but bibliographers sometimes forget that the number printed is a marketing decision which bears no relation whatever to printing conditions, although a master would of course be concerned to apportion all the work on hand in the most economic way. 23 "The Degressive Principle," Times Literary Supplement , 1 Sept. 1966, p. 781. 24 I hope it will be agreed without my listing references that such an assumption is widespread. Professor Todd at least agrees, for he once wrote, in iconoclastic vein: "Implicit in most accounts of press-work on hand-printed books is the convenient assumption that, at a given time, the entire resources of the shop are devoted to the production of a single work . . .". — "Concurrent Printing: An Analysis of Dodsley's Collection of Poems by Several Hands ," PBSA , XLVI (1952), 45. Jobbing work may be invoked as a convenient way of explaining apparent delay, but even in Professor Hinman's discussion of the First Folio, which takes some account of other works printed by Jaggard in 1621-3 (see I, 16-24), the fundamental work patterns are traced in isolation from the other work on hand as though the Folio contained in itself all the evidence of its production. 25 The Bowyer books tabled in appendix II (g) may serve as examples. The several editions of Voltaire were printed quite quickly (nos. 1-4); the 20 sheets of Baxter, a more difficult text, and the 17½ sheets of Spenser, both took 33 weeks (nos. 5 and 6); Lobb's 34 sheets, on the other hand, were finished in only 29 weeks; more direct evidence of the different speeds of work on different books can be seen in appendix II (a) — (f). For Ackers, see A Ledger of Charles Ackers, Printer of 'The London Magazine' (1968), p. 19. Few printers, however, were as slow as Nicholas Okes was with one work: in five years he had printed only 6 sheets of a book called Speculum Animae — Jackson, Records of the Court of the Stationers' Company, 1602-1640 (1957), p. 180. 26 Professor Todd later wrote of concurrent printing as a practice "extraordinary in the seventeenth century" but "commonplace in the eighteenth" — "Bibliography and the Editorial Problem in the Eighteenth Century," SB , IV (1951-2), 46. G. Thomas Tanselle, "Press Figures in America," SB , XIX (1966), 129-30, also writes of the need for fuller information on all books being handled within a shop at one time. 27 "Edward Allde as a Typical Trade Printer," Library , 4th ser. (1929), 143. 28 "Analytical Bibliography and Shakespeare's Text," MP , LXII (1964), 55. 29 Stower, The Printer's Grammar (1808), p. 376, makes the point: "Compositors and pressmen are at all times dependent on each other; they therefore demand the constant attention of the overseer [my italics] in order that nothing may occur to cause a stoppage or standing still to either party." In a smaller office this concern for oversight and disposition of the work on hand would naturally have been the master's. 30 See Table 11, Cambridge University Press , I, 106-7. For Bowyer, see appendix II (e) where, of 14 compositors listed for the two-week period, only one (C. Knell) worked on a single book. 31 Rules of a London chapel in 1734, printed by Ellic Howe, The London Compositor (1947), p. 31. 32 The two charts may be compared to those given as Table 15 in The Cambridge University Press . Taken together, the five charts show completely different patterns of work at five distinct stages of a continuous working period of five months, although many of the men and books involved are the same. 33 Bowers, "Bibliographical Evidence from the Printer's Measure," SB , II (1949-50), 153-67, esp. pp. 155-6: "The most elementary and easily discerned cases which can be determined by measurement occur when . . . printing of a book is so materially interrupted that when work is resumed a different measure is inadvertently employed." See also "Purposes of Descriptive Bibliography, with Some Remarks on Methods", Library , 5th ser. (1953), p. 18 n., and "Underprinting in Mary Pix, The Spanish Wives (1696)," Library , 5th ser. (1954), p. 248. John Smith, The Printer's Grammar (1755), pp. 197-8, suggests other reasons why measures, ostensibly the same, might differ. For Moxon, see Mechanick Exercises , p. 203. 34 "Notes on Running-Titles as Bibliographical Evidence," Library , 4th ser. (1938), pp. 318-22. In 1909 A. W. Pollard had drawn attention to the recurrent headlines in Folio 2 Henry IV ( Shakespeare Folios and Quartos , pp. 134-5). 35 "The Headline in Early Books," English Institute Annual, 1941 (1942), p. 187. 36 "The Composition of The Insatiate Countess , Q2," SB , XII (1958), 202. 37 "The Printing of Beaumont and Fletcher's The Maid's Tragedy , Q1 (1619)," SB , XIII (1960), 201; see also pp. 202, 204, 208 for assumptions about timing. 38 "The Printing of Philaster Q1 and Q2," Library , 5th ser. (1960), p. 22. 39 Ibid. In the article from which the last three quotations are drawn, Professor Turner suggests that "the erratic time-re-lationship" and therefore the imbalance in the relationship of composition and presswork may reflect variable copy, extra help with distribution, or indicate that "typesetting was attended by serious difficulties" — the textual implications of the latter inference are important. 40 "Printing Methods and Textual Problems in A Midsummer Night's Dream , Q1," SB , XV (1962), 46. 41 "The Printers of the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647, Section 2," SB . XX (1967), 37. Another point of view on this whole question of delay is that of A. K. McIlwraith: "It seems that printers . . . were sometimes willing to interrupt their work for quite a slight cause. This in turn suggests that time was not at a premium, and casts some doubt on any argument which rests on the assumption that speed was economically important." See "Marginalia on Press-corrections," Library , 5th ser. (1950), p. 244. 42 "Purposes of Descriptive Bibliography," p. 18 n. Elsewhere Professor Bowers brings together in a single sentence many of the considerations raised here: "On the evidence of spelling, only one compositor set (*) B-D, but with about half a normal edition-sheet, he could not have kept up with the press and therefore would not have imposed with two skeleton-formes." — "The Variant Sheets in John Banks's Cyrus the Great , 1696," SB , IV (1951-2), 179. 43 "Setting by Formes in Quarto Printing," SB , XI (1958), 49. The compositor was unlikely to have been "concerned" at the imbalance, since the reason for it (edition size) was none of his making. It is also salutary to observe that the words ' his press ,' as in Professor Turner's article cited in note 38, show the unconscious hardening of assumption into self-evident truth. 44 "An Examination of the Method of Proof Correction in Lear ," Library , 5th ser. (1947), p. 29. 45 Ibid. , p. 28. In "Elizabethan Proofing," Joseph Quincy Adams Memorial Studies (1948), pp. 571-86, Professor Bowers added "I feel that this was the major delay which was circumvented and that a certain reduction possible in the time for press-correction was only a minor consideration." (p. 574). 46 "Notes on Running-Titles," p. 331. In a later note, Professor Bowers states that "running-titles will almost inevitably reveal simultaneous setting and printing of different portions of a book" — Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), p. 125. 47 The Variants in the First Quarto of 'King Lear ' (1940), pp. 48-9. 48 "The First Edition of Your Five Gallants and of Michaelmas Term ," Library , 5th ser. (1953), pp. 23, 28. Professor Price believes that Michaelmas Term was printed partly by Purfoote and partly by Allde: "In [its] printing, one skeleton was used for gatherings A and B, two for C-I, one press doing the inner, the other the outer, formes; but for gatherings H and I, the presses twice interchanged the formes" (p. 29). 49 "Underprinting in The Spanish Wives ," p. 254. Each press is said to have printed and perfected its sheet with the one skeleton forme. 50 "The Textual Relation of Q2 to Q1 Hamlet (I)," SB , VIII (1956), 46. See also "The Printing of Hamlet Q2," SB , VII (1955), 42. 51 Cantrell and Williams, "Roberts' Compositors in Titus Andronicus Q2" SB , VIII (1956), 28. They add: "The book was printed throughout with one skeleton-forme, and so necessarily on one press . . .". 52 "The Authorship and Bibliography of The Revenger's Tragedy ," Library , 5th ser. (1960), p. 273. Quite apart from the question of skeleton formes, the inference from paper might be queried. It is just as simple to assume that that the heaps were told out by the warehouseman (or boy) from alternate bundles as required for each successive signature. Otherwise it must be assumed that each press knew in advance precisely what proportion of the edition it would print and had on hand all the white paper it would need to complete that work. 53 Cantrell and Williams, "The Printing of the Second Quarto of Romeo and Juliet (1599)," SB , IX (1957), 107, 113-4. 54 "Shakespeare's Text and the Bibliographical Method," SB , VI (1954), 79. 55 Cantrell and Williams, "Roberts' Compositors in Titus Andronicus ," p. 28: "The problem of Titus Q2 is further complicated by the fact that in the reprint X and Y did not combine to set their material in a normal pattern for two-compositor work in which each man serves a different press. In fact, the peculiar feature of Titus is that there should be a second compositor at all. The running-title pattern indicates no such second workman " (my italics). 56 "The Text of Heywood's The Fair Maid of the West ," Library , 5th ser. (1967), p. 302. In "The Printing of A King and No King Q1," SB , XVIII (1965), 258, Professor Turner had assumed that a single skeleton printing sheets A-F implied one compositor, and that a second skeleton introduced at G implied another, and quicker, one — although apart from signings there were otherwise "no means to distinguish the work of the two compositors" (n. 12). See also Hinman, Printing and Proof-Reading II, 522 n.l. 57 In some cases two skeletons, regardless of edition size or speed of composition, may be evidence not of increased speed of production, but of a slower than normal rate of production, simply because it can be a very convenient way of keeping type safely standing whether before or after printing (either to allow of proofing in the sheet, or to defer distribution). Stower, Printer's Grammar , p. 474; "Forms will sometimes remain a considerable length of time before they are put to press." 58 Ibid. , Table 15, but continued below in appendix I (a) and (b). 59 We might stand to gain clarity if, when discussing changes in the pattern of skeletons, we were to abandon the term "interruption" with its assumptions about timing and its implications of delay. Normally what we are observing is simply a discontinuity. 60 Printing and Proof-Reading I, 46. See also I, 124 where the same point is made and Professor Hinman cites Moxon: "It is also Customary in some Printing Houses that if the Compositer or Press-man make either the other stand still through the neglect of their contracted Task, that then he who neglected, shall pay him that stands still as much as if he had Wrought." Professor Hinman seems to imply that if a forme were machined in appreciably less time than one could be set the press would stand idle and the compositors would have to reimburse the pressmen. But this can hardly have been so. It was the master's job to worry about these things; Moxon is only concerned with 'neglect' of a 'contracted Task.' 61 Although I am not really concerned to query Professor Hinman's estimate of the edition size of the Folio, it is possible to offer more precise estimates on costs than either Greg or Willoughby has given. Such a note in itself may be of interest, but my purpose is larger: to show how costing methods current in 1700 can be applied to the 1620's. It so happens that Cantrell Legge the Cambridge printer has left a very detailed "direction to value most Bookes by the charge of the Printer &amp; Stationer. as paper was sould Anno Dni: 1622" (Cambridge University Archives Mss. 33.2.95 and 33.6.8). The Folio contains about 227 sheets. At the highest of Legge's 1622 prices, for paper and printing of the best quality, it would have cost 13s.4d. per ream. For average quality the cost would probably have been nearer, in all, to 10s. or 11s. per ream. At the first of these prices, an edition of 500 copies would have cost £151.6s.8d. to produce; for an edition of 1000 copies the cost would have been £302.13s.4d.; for 1250 copies it would have been £378.6s.8d. Legge indicates that the Stationers' mark-up was usually twice as much again as the prime costs for paper and printing ("So they gaine clearly for euery 12s. laid out 1-5-0 The like pro portion you may make of all other english, &amp; forraine bookes"). However many were printed, the unit cost per copy of the Folio, accounting paper and printing at the highest price (13s.4d. per ream printed), would be 6s.od. A normal markup would therefore give a selling price of 18s. (not far off Steevens' £1.os.od.). The maximum possible return therefore to the four partners would be £300 for 500 copies selling at 18s. each; £600 for 1000 copies; and £750 for 1250 copies. These figures are crude, but they are not so wrong as to be irrelevant. If 500 copies were printed, given a two-year printing period, the investment would yield roughly 100% per annum, if 1000 copies were printed it would have been 200% per annum. But since a good proportion of the prime costs would not have had to be met until printing was well advanced, nor the balance paid until after printing had finished, a substantial part of the "investment" monies could have been met from the income from sales. Even the lowest of these returns (on an edition of 500) would have justified the venture. It may also be noted that the amount regularly allowed to retailers was 3s. in the £. ("Notes on Printing at Cambridge," p. 103). It is possible to refine the figures further. Legge priced the best paper at 5s.6d. per ream; printing would therefore have cost 7s.10d. per ream. Gay's contract with Purslowe allowed 8s. per week for 3000 impressions per day; this meant, for a full press, 16s. per week for 18,000 impressions (or 18 reams perfected); this gives a price of roughly 10½d. per ream. Presswork on the Folio might therefore be set at 11d. per ream. Now, applying methods customary in 1700, allowing for correction at one-sixth the rate for composition, and adding the "printer's thirds" for over-heads, the detailed costs of printing may be outlined as follows: Presswork 11d. Composition 3s. 8d. Correction 8d. ------- 5s. 3d. Add for overheads 2s. 7d. ------- Cost of printing per ream 7s.10d. Add cost of paper 5s. 6d. ------- Total price for paper and printing per ream 13s. 4d. 62 Printing and Proof-Reading II, 438. Two skeletons were used in quires F-X, a-b. See also I, 125-6: "One of the most striking facts about the Folio is that only one set of rules appears throughout most of the book; and the continuous use of the same rules can be satisfactorily accounted for only if presswork could keep continuously abreast of composition without difficulty. [A footnote adds: "Otherwise two sets of rules — two 'skeletons' — would almost certainly have been used."] Evidence from rules alone therefore establishes the very strong likelihood that the Folio press regularly worked off one forme as fast as the immediately succeeding forme was set." 63 Ibid. , I, 123. At this point Professor Hinman also writes: "Each successive forme [in 'o'] had been printed off and was ready for distribution by the time compositorial work for the next forme but one was undertaken." The distribution pattern shows that this was so, but I fail to see its relevance to speed of presswork; it simply means that setting did not go forward until the last forme but one was distributed. Professor Hinman mentions the possibility that composition was quite regularly interrupted on the completion of each new forme "to allow the press to catch up" but rejects the idea with the words "of such a practice there is neither evidence nor any shadow of likelihood " (my italics). The same sequence may be followed at variable speeds . 64 Ibid. , I, 75. At I, 153 we find: "Whether one or two skeletons were used in such a book probably depended upon the composition-presswork relationship." See also I, 28 n.l, 49, 364; II, 490-1, 524. 65 Ibid. , I, 123. See also I, 49: ". . . one compositor (and hence, it may be added, two or more compositors setting alternately; for this would amount to much the same thing) . . .". One should add that even without prejudice to the main thesis of balanced work on the Folio alone, Professor Hinman's masterly account of the work done on the Folio concurrently with other books makes it quite clear that a 'norm' of concurrent printing, as shown for the 1700's or 1730's, also applied to the 1620's. 66 Ibid. , I, 74 n.2. The demonstration referred to is, I think, that given at I, 123-4; see note 63 above. 67 "Setting by Formes in Quarto Printing," p. 42. The second quarto referred to is The First Part of The Contention (1594). 68 "The Printing of Philaster ," p. 22. See also "Printing Methods in A Midsummer Night's Dream " where Professor Turner argues that if type from B(o) is found in both formes of sheet C, and type from B(i) is found only in part of C(i), and if type from C(o) is found in both formes of D, and type from C(i) is found only in D(i), then, "when type reappears in this manner, composition cannot have been seriatim " (p. 36). The following remarks make it clear that Professor Turner means cannot have been seriatim "without press delays." The fundamental argument is not bibliographical in the sense that Professor Hinman's is. 69 "The Printing of A King and No King ," p. 258. See also, in "Printing Methods in A Midsummer Night's Dream ," Professor Turner's suggestion that "It seems likely that the compositor, working on the assumption that composition and press-work could stay more or less in balance, originally intended to follow the conventional procedure for setting by formes — to compose two formes, distribute the first, set the third, distribute the second, [set the fourth] and so on." (p. 46). 70 "Shakespeare's Texts — Then, Now and Tomorrow," SS , XVIII (1965), 31. It is also pointed out there that, before Richard II , "no first quarto has hitherto yielded such entirely conclusive evidence of setting by formes as the Folio does throughout" (p. 28). 71 See Turner, "Printing Methods in A Midsummer Night's Dream ," p. 39: "By itself the testimony of shortage is, I believe, less reliable than any other bibliographical technique." 72 Printer's Grammar , index. See also Moxon, Mechanick Exercises , p. 239: " Counting or Casting off Copy . . . is to examine and find how much either of Printed Copy will Come-in into any intended number of Sheets of a different Body or Measure from the Copy ; or how much Written Copy will make an intended number of Sheets of any assigned Body and Measure ." 73 "Cast-off Copy for the First Folio of Shakespeare," SQ , VI (1953), 259-73. 74 Another theory that one should like to have some external evidence for is that which closely associates a compositor with a particular set of type cases. Professor Hinman offers a very fine discussion of the question and has much contributory evidence for identifying compositors from type-groupings where distinctive spellings are lacking. See also Turner, "Reappearing Types," pp. 200-3. I have not examined Cambridge or Bowyer books for evidence of this kind. 75 So Richardson, advising Oxford to do "as the London Printers do, reckon at the rate of 2d in the shilling for the Press Correctors, of what is paid the Compositors." — quoted by I. G. Philip, Blackstone and the Reform of the Oxford University Press (1957), p. 40. 76 The Shakespeare First Folio (1955), p. 464. 77 All the statement means is that some evidence of correction has survived; it leaves quite open the possibility that invariant formes already embody corrections, and that even where formes are variant the 'uncorrected' states may be intermediate ones. 78 Instances of an 'uncorrected' state surviving in a single copy point to the dangers we run if we too readily equate invariant formes with uncorrected ones. The 'uncorrected' states, being earlier, are likely to be fewer and in most cases may have disappeared completely. In "A Proof-sheet in An Humorous Day's Mirth (1599) printed by Valentine Sims," Library , 5th ser (1966), pp. 155-7, A. Yamada notes that "out of fifteen copies examined, the Bute copy alone retains the uncorrected readings on the outer forme of G, and all the other copies have the forme in the corrected state." (p. 155). Of twenty copies of Tailor's The Hogge hath lost his Pearle (1614), only one has inner and outer E in their 'uncorrected' states. 79 Stower said that it should be "an invariable rule" to demand a second revise, "particularly with foul compositors, as no sort of dependence can be placed on them" ( Printer's Grammar , p. 382). 80 Quoted by K.

This point is made time and again. Wood's petition of 1621 makes it clear that even of those with presses some were rich and some were poor: "the rich men of the Company by the power of their ordinances, dispose of all things in priuilege to their owne perticular benefits for the most part, and the poore Masters, and Iourney-men Printers haue little, and some of them no worke at all from the Company . . ." (Greg, Companion , p. 170). Lownes, Purfoote, Jaggard and Beale — "those foure rich Printers" — are most complained against for the privileges they hold and the punitive actions they can take against offendors, empowered as they are both by ordinance and their high position in the Company. 91 Jackson, Records of the Court of the Stationers' Company , p. 75. 92 Jackson, p. 169. The search uncovered a press operated by George Woods; it was dismantled. Woods of course had no right to a press at all. 93 Plant, The English Book Trade (1939), p. 84; Howe, London Compositor , p. 33. 94 Plomer, A Short History of English Printing, 1476-1900 (1915), pp. 185-8; Howe (p. 33) gives the figure as 35. 95 Ibid. , pp. 132-3. Professor Todd states that "By the end of the eighteenth century the personnel of the trade numbered no less than 2815" ("Observations on . . . Press Figures," p. 179). But this figure relates to 1818, not to the previous century, and its user implies that the number of master printers had virtually doubled in the previous 10 years — see Howe, p. 132. 96 "The Distribution of Almanacks in the Second Half of the Seventeenth Century," SB , XI (1958), 107-16. 97 The articles of 1635 (Greg, Companion , pp. 94-5) were still being ignored in 1637 ( Ibid. , p. 102). The trouble was partly that their enforcement was left to the men whose interests they were least calculated to advance. So one finds the journeymen continuing to complain that the orders of 1586-7 and those of 1635 had not been fulfilled and pleading that they be recorded in some court of justice so that they could be sued upon before a competent judge ( Ibid. , p. 326). The complaints come to a head again in 1645. 98 Collected Papers , pp. 76-77, 222-3, 240. The arguments from expediency given in The Times Literary Supplement during August-September 1966 seem to me to be beside the point.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Copyright Records and the Bibliographer by G. Thomas Tanselle *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a country which provides copyright protection by statute or which requires the deposit of works for the benefit of one or more of its libraries, the operation of the law will usually produce a body of documents relating to the literary and artistic output of that country. The exact nature of such material will vary according to the requirements of the statute, but one may expect it to contain information of bibliographical significance which would be difficult (and in some cases impossible) to locate elsewhere. For example, if the law defines the term of copyright for any work as dating from its publication, the records may include publication dates; if there is a manufacturing clause in the law, certain facts about the printing and binding of individual books may be given; if there is provision for the deposit of copies, the recorded deposit dates will furnish proof of the existence of particular books. Thus the bibliographer who knows what copyright records survive for the period and country with which he is concerned, and who possesses enough historical understanding of the copyright law to interpret them, has at his command a valuable tool for research. In the case of England and the United States, not only are the extant copyright records extensive; in addition, because of the unusual situation in which two countries with important literatures speak the same language, the copyright laws of each country have had an effect on the original publication of the literature of the other, so that bibliographers of authors writing in English must be aware of the copyright records of both countries. The English copyright law required registration of copyrighted works between 1710 and 1912, and there are also some records of registered books before and after this period. The United States, from the time of its first federal copyright law in 1790, has always included a provision for registration in its copyright legislation. For obvious reasons these records, even when they survive intact, do not constitute national bibliographies — some works may be copyrighted but never published, and many others may be published but never copyrighted. They do, however, provide a preliminary basis for a record of the two nations' literary output. Whenever a bibliographer finds information of interest to him in copyright records, he is making a secondary use of those records; he is finding them helpful in ways other than those for which they were designed, just as he may profitably consult a publisher's files which are no longer useful to the publisher in carrying on his business. Quite understandably and properly, the officials in charge of such records have normally been more concerned with maintaining whatever records are required for current purposes than with servicing archives of older material. In the United States, such men as William Elliot and Thorvald Solberg did recognize some of the bibliographical uses of the copyright records, but their hopes for a national bibliography based on them were not realized until 1891, and then only in part — a story which has been admirably set forth by Joseph W. Rogers in U. S. National Bibliography and the Copyright Law (1960). Since that time such men as Verner W. Clapp, former Chief Assistant Librarian of Congress, Joseph W. Rogers of the Copyright Office, and Frederick R. Goff of the Library's Rare Book Division have been particularly concerned with the historical importance of the old records. But the general indifference to this material, on the part of officials and scholars alike, has not yet disappeared, and bibliographers have remained peculiarly unaware of its potentialities. Although an enormous literature of copyright exists, 1 practically nothing has been written about the secondary use of copyright material by literary scholars and bibliographers. Walter Pforzheimer, in his well-known essay on "Copyright and Scholarship" in the English Institute Annual 1940 (1941), outlined the essentials of English and American copyright history for the use of scholars (pp. 164-99) but said little about the ways in which the records could be employed. In connection with the American records, only two writers have gone very far in discussing the specifically bibliographical significance of such material. On 30 December 1937, Martin A. Roberts of the Library of Congress read a paper before a joint session of the American Historical Association and the Bibliographical Society of America describing the pre-1870 records and urging their publication as a "national heritage." 2 Seven years later Ruth Shaw Leonard intensively studied the Massachusetts records of the period 1800-09 for her Master's thesis at Columbia and summed up her findings in 1946 in an essay entitled "The Bibliographical Importance of Copyright Records." 3 At that time the American copyright records had been used by only a few bibliographers. Charles Evans, in the 1910's, had taken advantage of some of the early district court records to add titles and deposit dates to his American Bibliography for the last decade of his coverage (1790-1800). And Miss Leonard, with Harry C. Bentley, had conscientiously read through the records in preparing the Bibliography of Works on Accounting by American Authors (2 vols., 1934-35) — which also contained an introductory chapter entitled "Copyright Laws and Administration — Their Significance to Bibliographers" (I, xi-xxi). In 1940 Louis C. Karpinski published his Bibliography of Mathematical Works Printed in America through 1850 , which made effective use of the copyright records to establish the publication of many titles no longer extant, just as Lyle Wright's American Fiction , 1744-1850 (1939) included some otherwise unknown titles discovered in a search through the collection of deposited title pages, and Marcus McCorison's Vermont Imprints 1778-1820 (1963) contained some unlocated titles taken from district court copyright records. Sidney Kramer, one of the pioneers in the use of copyright records for bibliographical purposes, included deposit dates in his A History of Stone &amp; Kimball and Herbert S. Stone &amp; Company (1939), and this practice of giving deposit dates in descriptive bibliographies has been used occasionally since then, notably in Jacob Blanck's Bibliography of American Literature (1955- ). For a more recent period, the published copyright catalogues were diligently searched by Wynot Irish for The Modern American Muse (1950), a list of American poetry between 1900 and 1925. Beyond these few works, American copyright records have rarely been drawn upon by bibliographers. The English records have been used more extensively. The registers of the Stationers' Company between 1554 and 1708 have been regularly employed for decades by bibliographers of Elizabethan and Jacobean literature, and such literary and bibliographical scholars as A. W. Pollard, W. W. Greg, R. C. Bald, Giles Dawson, C. J. Sisson, and Leo Kirschbaum have turned their attention to the whole question of copyright in England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Pollard and Redgrave, of course, included references to the Stationers' Company registers in the Short Title Catalogue (1926) of pre-1640 books, and both Greg and W. A. Jackson edited parts of the Stationers' court records (1930, 1957). For the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries, the English copyright materials are perhaps lesser known; but the increasing recognition of the textual importance of overseas editions of both English and American authors is drawing more attention to the copyright records of both countries, especially to the way in which the copyright laws of each affected the literary properties of the residents of the other. I. R. Brussel, in his pioneer bibliographical work on trans-Atlantic literary publications, the two-volume Anglo-American First Editions (1935-36), understood the indispensability of copyright records, and Graham Pollard contributed to the first volume a thoughtful discussion of the bibliographical implications of the Anglo-American copyright situation. More recently Simon Nowell-Smith has gone into the question of nineteenth-century international copyright from a bibliographer's point of view. 4 And James J. Fuld's The Book of World-Famous Music (1966) illustrates some of the bibliographical uses of copyright data on a world-wide scale. Copyright records have thus not been totally ignored by bibliographers, but they have not been drawn upon as frequently as one might expect, considering the obviousness of the uses to which they can be put. They can help to establish publication dates; they are a source of information about anonymous and pseudonymous works; they can supply publication details for individual author-bibliographies and titles for comprehensive imprint lists. It is not too much to say that a check of the relevant copyright records should be a routine part of any bibliographer's investigations; and no bibliography can be considered definitive or thorough which does not utilize them. Their precise bibliographical usefulness, however, depends on the provisions of the copyright laws at any particular time and place; in order to know how to interpret the records — or, indeed, what records to look for — the bibliographer must have some understanding of the copyright laws of the country and period with which he is concerned. It is with this in mind that I have drawn together a few suggestions for extracting from such records the bibliographical information they can yield. Since the American records are perhaps more complex and certainly less well-known than the English, the emphasis will be on them; and they can most conveniently be taken up in four groups: 1783-90, 1790-1870, 1870-1909, 1909-present. Following these four discussions are some briefer notes on the English records and some general considerations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. 1783-1790 Although the Massachusetts Bay Colony passed a law on 15 May 1672 prohibiting any printer from printing more copies of a book than its author had agreed to, 5 and although occasional ad hoc copyright acts were passed in the colonies upon the petition of particular individuals, there was no general copyright act in any of the states until Connecticut instituted one in January 1783. Massachusetts and Maryland followed in March and April, and on 2 May 1783 the Continental Congress passed a resolution recommending that each of the states work out a copyright law. Between that time and 1790, when the first federal law was enacted, all the other states except Delaware passed copyright laws, in several cases through the energetic sponsorship of Noah Webster. 6 Of particular interest to bibliographers in these twelve laws are any provisions they contain for registration or deposit. Whenever copyrighted works were to be registered, some sort of ledger or record book for that purpose must have existed at one time and might be extant today; whenever copyrighted works were to be deposited, the deposit copies might still survive, or at least a record of the deposits to prove that certain books once existed. The list below sums up these features of the state laws: 7 Date of Law Term of Copyright (years) Renewal Period (years) Registration Required Deposit Required Connecticut 8 Jan. 1783 14 14 yes no Massachusetts 17 March 1783 21 -- no yes Maryland 21 April 1783 14 14 yes no New Jersey 27 May 1783 14 14 yes no New Hampshire 7 Nov. 1783 20 -- no no Rhode Island Dec. 1783 21 -- no no Pennsylvania 15 March 1784 14 14 yes no South Carolina 26 March 1784 14 14 yes no Virginia Oct. 1785 21 -- yes no North Carolina 19 Nov. 1785 14 -- yes yes Georgia 3 Feb. 1786 14 14 yes no New York 29 April 1786 14 14 yes no In addition, seven states (Conn., Mass., N. H., R. I., N. C., Ga., N. Y.) specifically included a provision extending copyright privileges to citizens of other states only if the states involved had similar laws. And in five states (Conn., S. C., N. C., Ga., N. Y.), an author who did not allow a sufficient quantity of his books to be printed or charged an excessive price for them could be required to have more printed or lower the price; if he failed to comply, the state could authorize the complaining party to print additional copies. It can be seen from the list that nine states made the registration of titles a requirement for copyright. In six (Conn., N. J., S. C., N. C., Ga., N. Y.), registration was to be made with the Secretary of State; in Maryland it was to be handled by the "clerk of the general court," in Pennsylvania by the "prothonotary's office in the city of Philadelphia," and in Virginia by the "clerk of the council." Two of the laws (Md., S. C.) specifically mentioned the "register" into which the titles were to be entered. Two of the states (Md., Pa.) with registration requirements, however, had the further clause that the law was not to go into effect until such time as "all and every" of the states had enacted similar laws; since Delaware never passed a copyright law, the state copyright laws did not go into effect in Maryland or Pennsylvania either, and the number of possible record books is therefore presumably reduced by two (although, as it turns out, copyright entries were made in both states). As for the deposit of copies, only two states had such a clause — Massachusetts and North Carolina. In Massachusetts, two copies of each work were to be presented to "the library of the University of Cambridge [Harvard], for the use of the said university"; in North Carolina (the only state to require both registration and deposit), one copy of each work was to go — before publication — to the Secretary of State "for the use of the executive of the State." Of the nine possible sets of records and the two groups of deposit copies, the records for Connecticut, Maryland, and South Carolina have been located among state archives and the copies for Massachusetts have been traced in the Harvard library: Connecticut, 1783-89: Connecticut Archives (Colleges and Schools), 1st ser., II, 154-55, 159-61, 165-68.

Published in "Copyrights and Patents Granted by South Carolina," South Carolina Historical and Genealogical Magazine , IX (1908), 56-58. [6 entries for books] The located Connecticut records show only three entries (for Robert Ross, Joel Barlow, and William Blodget) under the 1783 act; but Trumbull, in his list of Connecticut imprints, supplies the registration dates of two more (for Andrew Law and John Lewis). 8 In addition, the Connecticut General Assembly granted Andrew Law a five-year copyright ("patent") for certain pieces of music in October 1781, fourteen months before the state passed its general law. 9 The eight Maryland entries of 7 January 1786 (for works by four men — Webster, Dwight, Barlow, and Law) were published in an article by Irving Lowens, whose thorough research has impressively demonstrated the bibliographical value of copyright records. The other most important investigation into pre-1790 copyright is Earle Coleman's essay, which records eleven Harvard deposit copies with the deposit dates for each (works by Barlow, Belknap, Billings, Bingham, French, Law, Webster, and Wood); undoubtedly other volumes were deposited which cannot now be located. The six South Carolina entries, published as long ago as 1908, are for books by David Ramsay, Henry Osborne, Noah Webster, Robert Squibb, Nicolas Pike, and John F. Grimke. Another aspect of copyright legislation in which bibliographers are interested is whether or not printed notices of copyright were required in copyrighted books. Only one of the state laws — in Pennsylvania — had such a clause; but, since Pennsylvania's law was not to become effective until all the other states had copyright laws, one should not expect to find printed notices even in Pennsylvania books. Nevertheless, such notices do appear, and a list of books with these notices forms at least a partial record of Pennsylvania pre-1790 copyrights. Charles Evans, working on the sixth and seventh volumes of his American Bibliography (1910, 1912), located fourteen works with these printed notices and recorded the copyright dates given in twelve of them. These references constitute in effect another published copyright record: Pennsylvania, 1784-89: Evans 18883 (Wharton); 19628 (Lutheran Church); 20471 (M'Culloch); 20481 (Markoe); 20632 (Lloyd); 20862, 20869 (Webster); 20889 (Wilson); 21081 (Falconer); 21365, 21371 (Lloyd); 21568 (Wall); 21651 (American Philosophical Society); 21745 ( Columbian Magazine ). [14 entries] Of the two books for which Evans did not give the date of copyright entry, one, Henry Wharton's Letter to the Roman Catholics (Evans 18883), contains only the statement (at the foot of the last page), "Entered according to Act of Assembly"; 10 but the other, the second edition of the opening volume of the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (Evans 21651), does carry the entry date of 29 April 1789. When Roger Bristol's list of additions to Evans is completed, it is possible that more books with Pennsylvania copyright notices can be traced. Apparently none of the copyright records of the other five states with requirements for registration are in existence, for officials in those states have not been able to turn up any copyright material for this period. 11 It is occasionally possible, however, to learn something of the copyright registrations in these states through secondary documents — such as the 1842 letter from Stephen Dodd to George Hood, in the Boston Public Library, which gives the Pennsylvania (1784) and New York (1786) registration dates for Andrew Law's music books. 12 Judging from the located records, the number of registrations in each state was probably quite small, and the information could have been entered in ledgers mainly devoted to something else — just as the South Carolina entries are found on the opening pages of a volume labeled "Georgia Grants," recording plats of land granted by Georgia authorities. Such records are naturally difficult to locate, and it is not impossible that more of them will eventually come to light. In the meantime, bibliographers must be content with copyright information concerning fewer than forty American books before 1790.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. 1790-1870 Since the United States Constitution (17 September 1787) gave Congress the power to grant copyrights, several authors in 1789 petitioned the federal government (rather than the states) for copyrights to their works — David Ramsay on 15 April, Jedidiah Morse on 12 May, Nicholas Pike on 8 June, and Hannah Adams on 22 July; and in granting copyrights to David Ramsay on 20 April 1789 for two of his books, Congress was making its first use of the copyright provision of the Constitution. 13 Noah Webster, at the same time, was drafting A Bill to Promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts , printed in New York on 23 June 1789, which led to the passage, on 31 May 1790, of the first federal copyright law in the United States (1 Stat. 124). This law required three steps for the securing of a copyright. First, a printed copy of the title page of any work proposed for copyright was to be deposited before publication with the clerk of the district court for the district in which the author (or copyright proprietor) lived, and the clerk was to record this deposit in a ledger which he kept for that purpose. Second, the text of the clerk's registration was to be inserted, within two months, in at least one United States newspaper, where it was to run for a period of four weeks. Third, within six months of the publication of the work, a copy was to be deposited in the office of the Secretary of State. The term of copyright was fourteen years, renewable for another fourteen years if this same procedure were repeated within six months of the expiration of the first term. Although later revisions of the law before 1870 modified the details somewhat, the basic procedures remained the same throughout this period, and each of them has important implications for the bibliographer who wishes to use the copyright records: (1) Title Pages and Record Books . Since title pages were to be deposited in advance of publication, many title pages were deposited (or entries recorded) for works which never actually got printed and published, and the amassed collection of title pages and record books thus serves in part as an account of unfulfilled projects — occasionally of great historic or literary importance. At the same time, certain works known to have been printed no longer survive, so it cannot be assumed that all title pages or entries for works no longer in existence necessarily represent books which were never printed, and the title pages or record books may therefore supply titles, not otherwise known, for inclusion in bibliographies or imprint lists. Because loose title pages are more easily lost than large record books, the record books are more complete and are the basic tool for research; but since the title-deposit dates were written on the title pages, it is conceivable (though not likely) that certain title pages might turn up for periods in which there is a gap in the record books for a particular district and thus supplement the record books. In any case, the title pages have an interest of their own for students of printing; especially after 1 January 1803, when prints and commercial labels were also included in the copyright law, these deposits form an enormously important collection of printed ephemera, sometimes containing examples of the earliest printing in various territories and states. Anyone interested in the records from this point of view should remember that the clerks of some district courts regularly pasted the title pages and labels into the record books rather than filing them in a separate place. 14 These materials have not been exploited by bibliographers and historians of printing as they should have been, though Frederick Goff has called attention to the importance of the title-page collection, and Roger Trienens has demonstrated the usefulness of the title pages in supplementing published bibliographies. 15 Lyle Wright, in compiling his three-volume bibliography of American Fiction (1939, 1957, 1966), used the title pages both as a source for additional entries and as a means of ascertaining the authorship of many anonymously published works (since the district-court clerks often wrote the names of the proprietors — who could also be the authors — on the title pages). 16 One should always keep in mind that items may not have been entered in the district which at first seems most likely, for the title could be entered by either the author or the proprietor, 17 who would not necessarily have lived in the same district. The most obvious bibliographical use of the record books (or the title pages) is to establish the date of title-page deposit; and since the title-page deposit was to be made before publication, this date provides a terminus a quo for the publication date. 18 The chief difficulty in using these records is that they are not adequately indexed. There is no general index to them all (since they were produced in various district court offices); while many of the individual volumes (but by no means all of them) do have indexes, they vary greatly in their comprehensiveness (some including titles and authors as well as proprietors, but most of them listing only proprietors), although they are usually accurate as far as they go. (2) Newspaper Notices . The requirement that each copyright proprietor insert a copy of the clerk's certificate of title-page deposit in a newspaper for a period of four weeks amounts in fact to a publication of the entire copyright record (until 1831) — but in a form which by its nature is difficult to consult. The scarcity of early newspapers is not the principal handicap, since each notice was to run for four weeks (making scattered missing issues not of crucial importance); the real difficulty is in guessing just which newspaper a particular proprietor would choose. These newspaper notices, therefore, are of little practical usefulness to the bibliographer, unless someone should undertake the unenviable task of indexing them. But whenever a gap exists in the surviving district court record books, the bibliographer will find it worthwhile to search the newspapers of that area for the appropriate period. Filling in such gaps (even if only in part) constitutes the chief bibliographical value of the newspaper notices. (3) Deposit Copies . Since published works were to be deposited within six months of publication, knowledge of the deposit date provides a terminus ante quem for the publication date: if the law were properly followed, the publication date could not have been more than six months before the deposit date. Taking the deposit date in conjunction with the date of title entry, one can usually narrow the time span during which publication took place: since the title was to be entered before publication, if the date of title entry is less than six months earlier than the date of deposit, the period in which publication occurred is correspondingly shortened. Deposit dates were written into the copies, and the Secretary of State also kept a record book for these deposits; even when certain deposit copies can no longer be found, therefore, it is often possible to ascertain the deposit dates from the Secretary of State's record books, which survive from 1796. The dates given are those on which the works were received in the Secretary of State's office, and they may be considerably later than the dates on which the works were dispatched by the proprietor or author (if such dates could be known). Bibliographers should not conclude that titles entered in the district court record books which do not reappear in the record books of deposits received by the Secretary of State were never printed or published. Inevitably some proprietors failed to comply with the deposit requirement, even though they had begun properly by entering the title; and, just as inevitably, certain deposit copies, duly posted by the proprietors, never reached their destination. (4) Renewal Records . Because a copyright proprietor was required to go through the same steps for renewal as for the original copyright, title pages had to be deposited again and a new entry made by the clerk of the district court. For this reason, copyright renewals furnish another way of filling some gaps in the records; if one is looking for the entry of a book published in a year for which the records of the appropriate district court are not extant, one may try the records fourteen years later, if they exist, or search the newspapers and find the renewal entry. Since the renewal was to be made within the last six months of the original term, one then has some idea of the time when the original copyright was entered (the copyright term ran from the date of title entry, not copy deposit). In the same way, if no deposit for a given book was recorded by the Secretary of State in the year of its known publication, a check of the deposit record fourteen years later may at least reveal the date of the renewal deposit. The amendments and revisions which followed are of interest to bibliographers in terms of the changes they brought about in the form of the records. The act of 29 April 1802 (2 Stat. 171, effective 1 January 1803) is significant from a bibliographical point of view only because it required all copyrighted works to carry a printed notice of the date of title entry, either on the title page itself or on one of the two pages immediately following (usually the verso of the title page), 19 a provision which has continued in effect to the present. On 3 February 1831 was passed the first general revision of the copyright law (4 Stat. 436), which as of that date superseded the 1790 act. It contained four important revisions: (1) the copyright term was henceforth to be twenty-eight years (instead of fourteen), renewable for fourteen; (2) the newspaper notice was required only for renewals; (3) copies of published works were to be deposited with the clerk of the district court (not the Secretary of State) within three (not six) months of publication; (4) the clerks of the district courts were to send these deposit copies and certified lists of all titles recorded, at least once each year, to the Secretary of State. In most other respects, the law remained as before. One result of these changes was that clerks of some district courts began entering the deposit date for each work on the same page of the ledger which recorded that work's title entry. Another result was that the records were kept in duplicate, so that one set could be furnished to the Secretary of State. This system normally provides the bibliographer with more than one source for the dates of registration and deposit. Since the original record books and the duplicate set were kept in different places before 1870, it is unlikely that the same portions of each set would be lost or destroyed; thus the so-called "duplicates" can be used to fill in many gaps which now exist in the original records. Similarly, in cases where the deposit copies themselves are no longer available, the deposit dates can often be located in the record books (usually the original set only) — a fact not generally recognized by bibliographers, even those who utilize deposit dates. Although neither copy of Melville's White-Jacket in the Library of Congress, for example, has a deposit date written in it, the deposit date (26 March 1850) may be ascertained from the record books of the Southern District of New York; the Library of Congress copy of his Piazza Tales contains a note specifically pointing out that the present copy is a replacement of the deposit copy, but again the deposit date (20 May 1856) may be found in the district court ledger. Whenever both sources of information exist for a deposit date (both the copy itself and the record book) — or for a registration date (the two sets of record books) — some discrepancy is possible, particularly since these are handwritten records (another reason why the "duplicates" are not really duplicates). In such cases, for the registration date precedence should be given to the original record over the "duplicate," and for deposit dates to the actual copy of the work 20 over the record book. One should also remember that, after 1831, a publication date can be gauged with somewhat more accuracy than in the 1790-1831 period, since it can be no more than three months prior to the deposit date. But the most important point, worth repeating, is that there are few published and copyrighted American works, especially after 1831, for which the deposit dates cannot be ascertained, even if the deposit copies are no longer in existence. The amendments to the 1831 revision have principally to do with the places where copies were to be deposited and the number of deposit copies required. The act of 10 August 1846 (9 Stat. 106, establishing the Smithsonian Institution) provided that one copy of every copy-righted work be deposited — for use rather than record — in the Smithsonian and one in the Library of Congress (in addition, of course, to the essential copy of record deposited with the district court for transmittal to the Secretary of State). The copyright amendment of 5 February 1859 (11 Stat. 380), which repealed these deposit regulations in regard to the two libraries, transferred the copyright duties from the Secretary of State to the Department of the Interior: previous records and deposits were moved, and all future ones were to be sent there. Finally, on 3 March 1865, another amendment (13 Stat. 540) again required that a second deposit copy be sent to the Library of Congress — and within one month of publication. The various changes in deposit requirements 21 should perhaps be summarized: 1790-1831: One copy to Secretary of State within six months of publication. 1831-1846: One copy to district court (for transmittal to Secretary of State) within three months of publication. 1846-1859: Three copies: one to district court (for transmittal to Secretary of State) within three months of publication; one to Smithsonian Institution; one to Library of Congress. 1859-1865: One copy to district court (for transmittal to Department of Interior) within three months of publication. 1865-1870: Two copies: one to district court (for transmittal to Department of Interior) within three months of publication; one to Library of Congress within one month of publication. One must keep these changes in mind when using the surviving deposit ledgers in order to interpret the dates properly. The district court deposit dates are usually preferable, when available, because in most cases the deposit copies had to travel a shorter distance to reach the clerk's office than to reach Washington and thus arrived sooner; on the other hand, for the five years after 1865, the law did not insist that copies be sent to the district courts as quickly as to the Library of Congress. A further complication is that many publishers did not comply with the deposit requirement, forcing Congress to make special provisions (in the acts of 3 March 1865 and 18 February 1867 [14 Stat. 395]) to penalize proprietors who failed to comply; so the recorded deposit dates for some works (particularly those of the smaller publishers) may not provide a reliable basis for estimating publication dates, since they may be late deposit dates resulting from a demand for compliance issued by the Librarian of Congress. The records of the receipt of deposit copies by the various depository agencies in Washington are now available for reference in the Rare Book Division of the Library of Congress and are complete except for a few gaps, as noted: State Department: 2 January 1796-29 May 1841 (11 vols.) [1841-59 not located] Department of Interior (Patent Office): 28 April 1859-5 July 1870 (3 vols.) Smithsonian Institution: 18 June 1852-1856 (unbound, in envelope 326); 29 February 1856-6 October 1858 (1 vol.) [1846-52 not located] Library of Congress: 1 December 1848-29 November 1852 (1 vol.); 31 March 1865-3 December 1886 (1 vol.) [1846-48 and 1853-58 not located] None of these is indexed, and the titles in each are arranged according to the order in which they were received; usually only the year of publication of each book is given, along with the precise day of receipt (but the Smithsonian sheets from 1852 to 1856 list only the year of publication, and its ledger from 1856 to 1858 adds only the date the entry was made). Finding a particular title can be a time-consuming process, but if one already knows the district court deposit date, the search is facilitated. Melville's Mardi , which was deposited at the district court on 17 April 1849, was received by the Library of Congress on 19 April; his Battle Pieces , deposited at the court on 17 August 1866, was received by the Library on 20 August. These facts suggest that bibliographers should always check the district court record books for deposit dates (at least after 1846) even when deposit copies are still on the shelves of the Library of Congress, for those deposit copies may not contain the earliest deposit dates. The district court deposit copies, forwarded to the State Department and then to the Department of the Interior, 22 should have been turned over to the Library of Congress in 1870; but copies in the Library may also be those originally sent to the Library in the periods 1846-59 and 1865-70. Two copies presently in the Library may contain different dates, one of them the date of receipt by the clerk of the district court, the other the date of receipt by the Library. So the deposit ledgers of the various agencies are helpful in understanding these discrepancies and in locating the earliest deposit dates. In addition, these registers of deposits received may be supplemented by certain published lists, for three attempts 23 were made during this period to provide a published account of copyright deposits: William Elliot, A List of Patents Granted by the United States (1822, 1823, 1824, 1825, 1826). [Supplements in these volumes list all deposits received by the State Department between 1796 and May 1825. The supplements in the 1822 volume cover 1796-1821, and the succeeding volumes contain annual supplements through May 1825.] Charles Coffin Jewett, "Copy-right Publications," in the Fifth Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution for the Year 1850 (1851), pp. 146-325. [Two supplements list all deposits received by the Smithsonian between 10 August 1846 and the end of 1850 (the first, pp. 146-236, covers 1846-49; the second, pp. 236-325, covers 1850).] Catalogue of the Library of Congress (1849, 1861); Supplement (1846-60). [The Supplements from 1846 through 1856 contain separate sections listing copyright deposits; the four Supplements for 1857 through 1860, as well as the two complete catalogues of 1849 and 1861, do not list deposits separately but mark them with a double dagger wherever they occur in the main alphabet. Together these Catalogues and Supplements entirely cover the Library's first period as a depository, from 10 August 1846 to 5 February 1859.] These published listings fill some of the gaps in the manuscript ledgers presently located: the Jewett list, covering 1846-50, reduces the gap in the Smithsonian ledgers to a year and a half, since those now available begin with 18 June 1852; and the Library of Congress Catalogues and Supplements completely fill the gaps in the located Library ledgers. The Library lists and the Jewett list for 1846-49 are the least useful of the published lists, however, because they do not give the dates of receipt, as both the Elliot and the 1850 Jewett lists do. The places to look for deposit dates, therefore, other than in copies of the works themselves, may be summarized in this way: 1796-1831: in the registers of copyrights received by the State Department (or, through May 1825, in Elliot's published version of these registers). 1831-1841: in the district court record books for certain states; and in the registers of copyrights received by the State Department. 1841-1846: in the district court record books for certain states. 1846-1859: in the district court record books for certain states; in Jewett's list of Smithsonian deposits and the handwritten registers of copyrights received by the Smithsonian; in the registers of copyrights received by the Library of Congress, supplemented (without dates) by the Library's published Catalogues and Supplements . 1859-1865: in the district court record books for certain states; and in the registers of copyrights received by the Department of Interior (Patent Office). 1865-1870: in the district court record books for certain states; in the registers of copyrights received by the Department of Interior (Patent Office); and in the registers of copyrights received by the Library of Congress. It is clear from this summary that the most important tool for research into deposit dates after 1831 is the long series of record books kept by the clerks of the district courts. Because they record the dates of original title entries (the "copyright" dates) and because they cover the entire period 1790-1870, they are obviously basic to any kind of copyright research for these years and constitute what is usually thought of as the "copyright records" before 1870. The copyright law of 1870 required that all the previous district court records be sent to the Library of Congress in Washington, and when those ledgers (dating from 1790) were added to the "duplicates" already there (dating from 1831), the result was a collection of over 600 large volumes and many additional bundles of loose papers (containing approximately 150,000 entries from 35 states). All this material (including 92 boxes of title pages) is now shelved in the Rare Book Division of the Library of Congress and constitutes a largely untapped bibliographical storehouse. Any bibliographer of nineteenth-century American literature should be intimately acquainted with the characteristics and contents of these records. The difficulties in using these volumes are a result of the lack of centralization in the administration of the copyright law before 1870, since complete uniformity would be impossible in records kept at scattered offices throughout the country. Most of the books contain only one entry per page, consisting of the formal phraseology required by law, the date of entry, and the exact wording of the title page; they may be entirely handwritten (as the majority were in the earlier years), or they may be made up of printed forms, filled in as required. But they vary in several respects: some include the actual printed title pages, and others give only a handwritten title; some have single-volume or multi-volume indexes (by title or proprietor or both), and others are not indexed at all; some report the dates of deposit of published copies (after 1831), and others do not. In addition, not all the district courts sent their records to Washington, or some were lost en route, for the "duplicates" sometimes cover periods missing from the original volumes, and gaps still remain. (An inventory of these records is provided below in Appendix A.) 24 One of the problems in using these records in their present form is that a bibliographer can never be sure that he has checked all the relevant material. This uncertainty is compounded by the inevitable feeling that the missing records may still exist in the states, not having been sent to Washington in 1870. A check of other repositories reveals that certain pre-1870 copyright records (for nine states and the District of Columbia) do indeed exist outside the Library of Congress — in the National Archives, the Seattle Federal Records Center, the South Carolina Library, the Texas State Library, the Virginia Historical Society, and the federal archives in Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, and Rhode Island. (A list of these materials is given in Appendix B.) 25 Out of this entire group of pre-1870 records, only a few have been published or transcribed. Most of these publications consist of small groups of entries taken from the record books in the Rare Book Division of the Library of Congress; but four of them — for Kentucky, Rhode Island, Texas, and Virginia (Richmond, 1864-65) — draw on the material housed in other locations, and one (for Richmond, 1790-1844) preserves the content of a record apparently now lost. 26 (See Appendix C.) The collection of copyright materials in the Rare Book Division of the Library of Congress also contains, in addition to the district court record books, the boxes of title pages, and the registers of deposits received by the four Washington deposit libraries, a small number of miscellaneous papers: (1) Letters — Library of Congress correspondence, both incoming and outgoing, on copyright matters (particularly acknowledgments of deposit copies) between 1852 and 1855, a letter book of the Commissioner of Patents, 1859-70, and some miscellaneous letters in Box 308; (2) Ledgers — a volume marked "Maps Labels &amp;c." (1849-58), with some music entries (1849-51) at the beginning; a volume listing the returns made by the clerks of the district courts for the Department of State, 1853-68; three unidentified indexes; and a volume containing (pp. 3-6) a list of the district court records received by the Library of Congress in 1870 (the list which formed the basis for the one Roberts published in 1939). This last ledger is of further interest because it contains (pp. 540 ff.) lists of books by twenty-six selected authors, 27 with the date of title entry for each work and often a reference to the volume and page of the original entry in the district court record books; it was evidently an attempt by someone in the Library of Congress, after the records were received in 1870, to furnish a convenient index for the most popular authors. Even though it omits a number of books, it can still serve today as a short-cut to locating the original title entries for these authors. The fact that such a list, incomplete as it is, can be useful suggests the complex nature of the records for this period. Until all the pre-1870 entries are published, with a complete index, no bibliographer can feel certain that he has found everything relevant to his subject. If the desired information happens to be in one of the indexed bound volumes, it can be found easily; but if it involves a district for which there is no index or for which the only surviving records are scattered loose sheets, the search can be time-consuming. The lack of centralization in the administration of the copyright law before 1870 made complicated records inevitable, and a consolidated index is essential if they are to be an effective tool for research. But the bibliographer who understands the changing provisions of the law which produced those records can find in them, even as they stand, a large amount of information not elsewhere available about the publications of many of the major writers of nineteenth-century America.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. 1870-1909 The copyright act of 8 July 1870 (16 Stat. 212), the first general revision of the copyright law after 1831, is a landmark in American copyright legislation. Its significance lies not in any altered conception of the nature of copyright but rather in a change of administrative procedure, for all copyright business was henceforth to be centralized in the Library of Congress. Title pages and copies were to be deposited with the Librarian of Congress, not the clerks of the district courts; and all previous records, from the various district court offices and the Department of the Interior, were to be transferred to the Library of Congress. It is impossible to overemphasize the importance of this centralization: the year 1870 is a dividing line which marks the end of fragmentary and inconsistent copyright records and the beginning of records that are complete and uniform. The basic requirements of the law were scarcely changed: the term of copyright was 28 years, renewable (within six months of expiration) for 14 more; the newspaper notice was for renewal only (to be printed for a period of four weeks, within two months of the date of renewal); a printed title page was to be deposited before publication; and two copies of the work were to be deposited after publication (mailed within ten days of publication). The bibliographer can use these dates to establish the approximate time of publication in exactly the same way as for the preceding period, since the publication date should fall, according to law, in the interval between the date of title entry and the date of copy deposit. This interval will generally be smaller (and its usefulness for determining a publication date presumably greater) than for the preceding period, since the deposit copies were supposed to be put in the mails no later than ten days after publication. From the bibliographer's point of view, therefore, the records for the period 1870-1909 are different from the earlier ones not in the kind of information they provide but in their completeness and greater ease of reference. Between 1870 and 1909 the various amendments and revisions of the copyright law generally had no effect on these provisions for title entry and deposit of copies. The revision of 1 December 1873 (Rev. Stat. 957) retained them as they were set forth in 1870; and the only change in them effected by the act of 3 March 1891 (26 Stat. 1106) was that copies be deposited (or placed in the mails for deposit) no later than the day of publication, thus reducing still further the legal interval between the date of title entry (which could be as late as the day of publication) and the date of copy deposit. Books were not always deposited as promptly as the law stipulated, however, and the act of 3 March 1893 (27 Stat. 743) specifically granted copyright privileges to works, however belatedly deposited, that had been received before 1 March 1893. Of the other amendments, those of interest to bibliographers are the act of 18 June 1874 (18 Stat. 78), which transferred one category of printed material — commercial prints and labels — to the jurisdiction of the Patent Office; the act of 19 February 1897 (29 Stat. 545), which established the position of Register of Copyrights; and the act of 7 January 1904 (33 Stat. 4), which described a special two-year copyright privilege for foreign works that were to be exhibited at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. The act of 1891, if it made only one small change in the deposit regulations, was nevertheless of the greatest importance in other ways, for it inaugurated certain features which have caused American copyright records to be of particular usefulness to bibliographers. For one thing, it provided for the granting of copyright protection to citizens of foreign countries, if those countries gave reciprocal protection to United States citizens — of bibliographical significance because of the publication data about foreign works which were thus inserted into the American record books. Along with this provision came the much-discussed requirement of American manufacture (the books deposited for copyright "shall be printed from type set within the limits of the United States, or from plates made therefrom"). Although the name and address of the printer were not entered into the record before 1909, it was this manufacturing clause which resulted, after 1909, in a large quantity of information of bibliographical interest. Finally, the 1891 act required the Librarian of Congress to report title entries of all works received to the Secretary of the Treasury, who in turn was "directed to prepare and print, at intervals of not more than a week, catalogues of such title-entries for distribution to the collectors of customs of the United States and to the postmasters of all post-offices receiving foreign mails." While the purpose of this provision was to facilitate the enforcement of the manufacturing clause, the more important result was the complete publication of the American copyright record (for deposited works) from 1891 forward. The record materials which have accumulated since 1870 under the centralized administration of the copyright acts (with a few exceptions) are now housed in the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress and are available there for reference. After 1891 the published records make a great deal of the copyright data readily accessible without a trip to the Copyright Office, but even for that period there is no substitute for the indexes and other resources to be found in the Office itself. For the years between 1870 and 1891, since there are no published records except for drama, most copyright information can be obtained only in the Copyright Office records; bibliographers dealing with this period should search these records in person whenever possible, even though the Office provides, for a fee, an excellent search service. To the uninitiated, the stacks and indexes at the Copyright Office may appear bewildering, but they actually are not difficult to use and are far less confusing than the pre-1870 records. For the period 1870-1909, the bibliographer should know in particular about three kinds of materials: the record books, the card indexes, and the published records. (1) Record Books . For the entire period 1870-1909, the record books are uniform in the kind of information they contain: the date of entry of a printed title page on or before the day of publication, a transcription of the title page, the name of the claimant, and the date of deposit of two copies on or after the day of publication. As before 1870, some titles were entered for works never finally published, and copies were sometimes not deposited for works that did get published. In a few cases the copies were received, but the date was not posted onto the record (in some of these instances the Library still has one or both of the copies bearing the copyright deposit date or stamp); in other cases the copies probably meant for deposit were received by the Library but not by the proper office and were therefore not recorded. The only changes in the record books during this period are changes of form, not of content. Between 1870 and the end of 1897, when application for copyright was made by letter, the record books have four printed forms per page for the insertion of information regarding four applications; each entry has a serial number, and there is a separate sequence of numbers for each year, with an attached letter designating the year, from A through C 2 . From 1898 through 30 June 1909 application was made on printed forms; and on 2 January 1900 a new series of volume numbers began, since in that year copyrights were divided into separate classes (for books, periodicals, and so on), with separate series of volumes for each class (but the volumes for drama, Class D, did not begin until 1901). For book applications there was now only one printed form per page (500 per volume), and the new sequence of serial numbers was prefixed with "XXc" (for "twentieth century"), running continuously from year to year; by 30 June 1909, volume 488 and XXc 243564 had been reached. For Class D (drama), the number of record books by 1909 amounted to seventeen (with four applications per page). Record books before 1900 are at present housed in closed stacks and may be requested by searchers; those from 1900 onward are shelved in open stacks. Assignments and renewals were handled in different ways. All assignments were entered in a separate series of record books, beginning on 25 July 1870 and continuing in an unbroken sequence throughout this period. These records are an unparalleled source of information, especially for bibliographers interested in the history of publishing firms, because it is possible here to trace mass transfers of titles and establish the line of succession of various firms. Renewals, on the other hand, do not form a separate category of records. Since the law required that copyright proprietors comply with the same requirements for renewal as for original registration, renewal entries are like the entries for original copyright and occur in the same sequence of serial numbers. 28 The deposit requirement of two copies also applied to renewals, and some publishers, such as Houghton Mifflin, occasionally printed cancel title pages bearing the renewal date for insertion into the deposit copies; this production of bibliographical oddities was by no means widespread, however, and was certainly not required. 29 The changes of form in the records are of little practical significance to most searchers, who will come to the books with a list of particular serial numbers they wish to look up. The important point is that these volumes constitute the basic copyright record for the period and that they are complete. The printed title pages and the applications for these years are stored in the Federal Records Center in Alexandria, Virginia; although they are available upon request, the completeness of the record books makes them of less significance than in the pre-1870 period, for there are no gaps in the records which they might fill and no information in them not included in the record books. 30 The deposit copies themselves no longer form a part of the records of the Copyright Office, but many of them are on the shelves of the Library of Congress, and others may turn up almost anywhere. The 1909 act empowered the Librarian to make requisitions for the second deposit copies of any previously deposited works which he considered desirable for the Library to possess in more than one copy; in this way both deposit copies of certain works by a number of major writers have been preserved. (2) Card Indexes . Because the entries were made in the record books in chronological order, some kind of index is essential for locating particular items with any efficiency. The years from 1870 through 1897 are covered in one card index, affectionately referred to by the Copyright Office staff as "Old High." This index consists of hand-written cards and slips of various sizes: some cards contain many entries, others only one; some were written at the time of registration, others much later in an attempt to improve the index; some are Library of Congress requisitions for second deposit copies, and others have printed strips mounted on them. Entries are under copyright claimants, authors, and titles. The claimant entries are supposed to be complete, but the entries for authors and titles were not consistently made throughout the period. As a result, the index is not entirely complete; in addition, cards may sometimes be misfiled, since they are not held in the drawers by rods and since there have been various attempts to improve the index by adding cards. Despite its deficiencies, the index generally provides the desired reference, especially if one knows the name of the copyright claimant and can check under it. These cards do not normally give the dates of registration and deposit but only the registration serial numbers, which can then be looked up in the proper record book. The card for Herman Melville, for example, lists beside the title Clarel simply the number G7090; one then locates this entry in the 1876 (G) record books and finds that the title for Clarel was entered on 8 June 1876 and the copies deposited the following day — information not available, incidentally, in the deposit copy in the Library of Congress. The remainder of this pre-1909 period is included in a card index which covers the years 1898 to 1937. This index is divided according to the various classes of copyrightable material, but the index for books is usually the only one bibliographers will need to consult. The book index for 1898-1937 consists of two alphabets, one of claimants and one of authors (and some titles). For the years 1898 to 1909 the claimant entries are on printed "proprietor cards" which record the dates of title entry and copy deposit, transcribed from the original applications, along with the registration serial number. It is not necessary, therefore, to consult the record books themselves during this period, except for the purpose of double-checking (and the information in the record books is also a transcription from the applications). The author index is complete for copyrighted books represented by Library of Congress cards, but its completeness in regard to the authors of works not so represented cannot be assumed. Claimant indexes are always the basic and most thorough ones for copyright purposes, a fact which bibliographers, generally accustomed to searching by authors, should keep in mind (and this very fact is what makes copyright records so useful for research into the history of publishing firms). To sum up, the entire 1870-1909 period is adequately (if not quite completely) indexed in two basic card catalogues: a claimant-author-title catalogue covering 1870-97, and separate claimant and author files covering 1898-1937. Books falling near the dividing line (that is, in 1897 or 1898) could conceivably turn up in either index and should be checked in both. 31 (3) Published Records . The copyright records for this period have been partially published, in two publications, one covering all entries for drama and the other containing deposits of all classes beginning with 1891. Both publications should be basic tools for all bibliographers of American literature, but they are not as well known as they deserve to be. While they are not a substitute for the materials in the Copyright Office, they are in some respects easier to use, and they at least provide the basic data about many works from this period without the trouble of a trip to the Copyright Office or correspondence with a member of the search staff. In 1916 and 1918 the basic tool for copyright research in the field of drama during this period was published: Dramatic Compositions Copyrighted in the United States, 1870 to 1916 . 2 vols. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1916-18. The arrangement is by title, with an index of authors and claimants; for each title are given the dates of registration and deposit and the registration serial number. It is important to note that this work lists all titles of dramatic compositions registered, not just those that were eventually deposited, and consequently is a substitute for the record books as far as drama is concerned. The thoroughness of the work and its indexing also make it a more dependable guide than the sometimes erratic card catalogue for 1870-97. Anyone seeking copyright information about drama during this period should consult this work first and will probably have no reason to check further in the Copyright Office itself. 32 The other work, authorized by the act of 1891, is surely one of the most important bibliographical tools in existence, at least in the form which it eventually assumed. The 1891 law provided for the publication of all title entries for which copyright had been completed by the deposit of two copies, and the Catalogue thus started has continued to the present, with one change of title: Catalogue of Title-Entries . 47 vols. 1 July 1891-June 1906. Catalogue of Copyright Entries . July 1906- . During its early years the Catalogue was not an effective instrument for research, both because it did not contain sufficient information and because the information it did contain was not conveniently arranged. For the first 227 weekly issues, the titles were listed in one column and the names of proprietors in another, but in no particular order and with no index and no specific dates (although one could conclude that the works had been deposited during the week covered by the issue). These early issues do serve as a record of all works deposited, but they can be used for reference only by running through the entire list of titles. Gradual improvements occurred in the following stages: No. 228 (11-16 Nov. 1895): books arranged alphabetically by proprietors in each issue. No. 323 (6-11 Sept. 1897): specific date of receipt of deposit copies recorded. No. 327 (4- 9 Oct. 1897): books arranged alphabetically by authors, followed by index of proprietors. No. 340 (3- 8 Jan. 1898): registration number as well as deposit date recorded. No. 348 (28 Feb.-5 March 1898): specific date of title entry as well as registration number and deposit date recorded. It was not until nearly seven years after the start of the Catalogue , with No. 348, that the entries contained the information one would expect — registration number and dates of registration and deposit — and even then the only indexes were weekly. With volume 26, for the first three months of 1901, appeared the first index for an entire volume (giving the names of proprietors and authors and the titles of plays and periodicals). When the new series began on 1 July 1906, the Catalogue was divided into four parts, for books, periodicals, musical compositions, and fine arts. The successive sections of Part I (Books) were cumulated into semi-annual volumes with excellent author-proprietor indexes, so that from the middle of 1906 there are only two indexes per year (for books). The Catalogue is essentially a twentieth-century tool, therefore, because its indexing is inadequate before 1901 and the information it contains not sufficiently detailed before 1898. For the years before 1901 the card indexes in the Copyright Office are much simpler to use than the published Catalogue , although before 1898 they may be some-what less dependable; even after 1901 they may be more convenient for certain kinds of research, since they bring together entries from large spans of years and obviate the drudgery of going through numerous annual indexes. And for information about titles which were never deposited, the Copyright Office card indexes are essential, since this information is not included in the published catalogues (except the cumulated one for drama). The Catalogue does not supersede the Copyright Office files, but it does make possible extensive copyright research, at least from 1901, without recourse to those files. 33 This period may be divided into three segments, according to the kind of indexing available (aside from the published index for drama): 1870-1891: card index, not entirely complete, containing references to record books. 1891-1897: card index, not entirely complete, containing references to record books; complete published record of deposits, lacking important information and index. 1898 and after: complete card indexes, duplicating information in record books; complete published record of deposits, with basic copyright data and indexes (cumulated volume-indexes beginning in 1901). These changes are evidence of the fact that the period was a transitional one, in which the newly centralized Copyright Office was gradually developing the efficient techniques which would characterize it in the twentieth century.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. 1909 — present Whereas the 1870 law represented a change in administrative procedure rather than in definition of the term of copyright, the act of 4 March 1909 (35 Stat. 1075, effective 1 July 1909) made fundamental changes in the procedures required for securing copyright, the first such changes since the original law of 1790. From 1790 to 1909, the term of copyright had dated from the deposit of a printed title page prior to publication, in order to protect a work during the course of publication; the 1909 statute eliminated entirely the necessity of registering title pages in advance of publication and designated the term of copyright to begin with the date of publication. (The term was still 28 years, but renewable for another 28, rather than 14 — without inserting a notice in a newspaper.) Henceforth the "copyright date," by legal definition, was to be synonymous with the publication date; and as a result bibliographers have at their fingertips, in the copyright records and the published Catalogue , the official publication dates of all copyrighted works for which registration has been made in the United States since the middle of 1909. To be sure, the actual publication date (or date of release to the general public) may in some cases be different; but deciding what constitutes an "actual publication date" is an arbitrary matter anyway, and the fact remains that the date in the copyright records is the one reported by the publisher (or author, or whoever was the copyright proprietor) as the publication date (and therefore the date on which he wished his copyright protection to begin). So, in the post-1909 records, there are no title registration dates and no collection of title pages, but only the dates of publication — and, as before, the dates of deposit of two copies, important for the bibliographer as proof that physical copies of the books existed on those dates. The other most important feature of the 1909 law, from the bibliographer's point of view, has to do with the requirement of American manufacture, initiated in the 1891 act. Whatever its merits (or demerits) from other points of view, it became a great boon to the bibliographer in 1909, for the new statute required, as part of each application for copyright, an affidavit giving the names of the printer and binder and the date of the completion of printing. Since the printer was not obliged, as in England, to place his name on the printed matter itself, 34 this manufacturing information for American books is usually not elsewhere available, unless the printers' or publishers' files exist and are accessible. Descriptive bibliographers generally record the names of printers when they are provided in a colophon or printer's imprint and sometimes go to elaborate lengths to consult publishers' records. While there is no doubt that publishers' records are valuable (in furnishing facts about sizes and dates of impressions, for example), the point here is that those records are not the most convenient source for the names of the printers and binders of all copyrighted American books after 1909. The copyright records, open to public inspection, contain them, and often in addition the officially sworn date of the completion of printing for each book (but the presence of this date depends on the form of affidavit in use at any given time). One can easily discover that Henry James's Gabrielle de Bergerac was printed and bound by J. J. Little and Ives (completed on 12 November 1918) and that Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio was printed by the Van Rees Press (finished 28 April 1919) and bound by the H. Wolff Estate — information not provided in the standard bibliographies of these authors. One other provision of the 1909 law will serve to suggest the bibliographical usefulness of twentieth-century American copyright records even for students of English and foreign literatures. Sections 21 and 22 of the act provided for "ad interim copyrights" of works in the English language first published abroad. Depositing one copy of any such work in the Copyright Office within thirty days after publication would secure to the author (or proprietor) an American copyright to last for a period of thirty days; if during that period the author (or proprietor) arranged to have an American edition of the work printed and deposited, he could secure a regular 28-year copyright. Although the lengths of these periods have varied in the years since 1909, the application for an ad interim copyright has always necessitated a statement of the original date of publication of the foreign edition; the ad interim record books (which begin with 16 July 1909) therefore contain the English publication dates of a great many works of twentieth-century English literature. The works entered naturally represent only an erratic sampling of all English books published (amounting to something more than 29,000 entries by the end of 1945); but for the works included, this source of information about publication dates is frequently a more convenient and accessible one than any which exists in England. From the ad interim record books one can learn that Norman Douglas's South Wind was published on 5 June 1917 and D. H. Lawrence's Pansies on 4 July 1929, facts which are not recorded in the standard Soho bibliographies of these authors. A similar statutory arrangement in regard to works first published abroad in a language other than English had existed from 3 March 1905 (33 Stat. 1000) until 1 July 1909, when a provision went into effect, as a part of the general revision of that year, specifying that a full-term copyright could be secured for works of foreign origin in a language other than English whether or not such works or translations of them were manufactured in the United States; the resulting "Class A Foreign" record books contain the original publication dates for a large number of foreign works (over 3000 entries between 22 March 1905 and 1 July 1909, and over 85,000 more by 1945). The copyright records for the post-1909 period are not strikingly different from those for the preceding period, except for the kinds of dates they include, but certain points about them are worth noting: (1) Record Books and Card Indexes . During the years from 1870 to 1909 both the record books and the card indexes contained information that had been transcribed from the claimants' original applications (which were then tied into bundles and are now stored in Alexandria). From 1909 on, the actual application forms were brought together to constitute these records, first as the card index and later as the record books. On 1 July 1909 a card form of application was introduced; each card (for books), when folded once, was the size of the proprietor cards which had been filed since 1898 and could be interfiled with them. These card applications continued in use for books until early March 1948 (for other classes the date varied between 1946 and 1948); they were filed alphabetically by claimants through 6 November 1937 and by registration number thereafter. Thus between 1909 and 1937 the claimant cards in the card index are the actual applications, not transcriptions of them; between 1937 and 1946 the card index may be used to supply registration numbers, which are then checked in the separate application card file. The publication date, the date of receipt of deposit copies, the date of the affidavit of American manufacture, and the XXc registration number are visible on each card without unfolding it; to learn the names of the printer and binder and the date of completion of printing, one must unfold the card (which of course necessitates pulling the rod from the card drawer). The record books for this period are correspondingly less useful, for three reasons: the entries in them are arranged by registration number, so that one must first ascertain the number in the card index anyway (or in the published catalogue); they contain no information not on the application cards (except, in some cases, that taken from the book itself); they are transcriptions, not original documents. From 1909 to late 1940 (for books) these record books contain handwritten entries on large pages; from October 1940 through early 1946 they consist of carbon copies of the certificates of copyright registration sent to claimants. Beginning with May 1946 (for books) a new page form of application came into use (although the old card form continued to be accepted until early 1948, so that original applications for book registrations during these years may be found either in the application card file or in the record books). The new applications were simply bound together in registration number sequence (thus in the approximate order of receipt) to constitute the record books. But after May 1946 the relationship between the record books and the card indexes is reversed, since the cards for the card indexes again became transcriptions of information contained in both the works and the applications. One must use the card index (or published catalogues) to ascertain the registration number; but if one wishes to check the application itself, one must look up the number in the record books. Though all the record books are official documents and the published catalogues prima facie evidence of the information they contain (by the law of 1909), historical scholars are always alert to the possibility of mistranscription and will find 1946 and 1948 the most important dates to remember in using the records, since that two-year period forms the dividing line between original applications as cards in drawers and original applications as pages in record books. 35 In addition to these basic indexes and record books, the Copyright Office contains a number of other files and records, some of which should be mentioned for their potential bibliographical usefulness. (a) The assignment card indexes, with entries under assignor, assignee, and (from 1927) titles, serve as a guide to the series of assignment record books; both the indexes and the record books provide information about the transfer of titles and are an essential source for publishing history and for author-bibliographies that take later editions and impressions into account. (b) The renewal record books (a separate series after 1909, with their own XXc numbers) are indexed (by claimants, authors, and some titles) in separate card indexes between 1909 and 1937, and in the general card indexes thereafter; whenever a renewal card for a given book is not present, one should check the original registration number in the appropriate record book, for the renewal registration numbers have consistently (since 1898) been posted at the point of original entry in the record books. (c) The pseudonym card file consists of twenty drawers covering the years before 1938 and forms a useful supplement to the record of pseudonyms in the Library of Congress catalogues of printed cards. (d) The "bio-biblio" file of material in vertical folders contains many bibliographical lists which have resulted from previous searches and dust jackets which include biographical information. (e) The correspondence and remitter indexes contain summaries of copyright correspondence and names of the actual remitters of copyright fees; these indexes, not open to public inspection, contain little of bibliographical significance but could occasionally furnish details for biographical studies of authors or publishers. Correspondence directly relating to completed registrations is, however, available for public inspection and copying if the request identifies the work either by registration number or in sufficient detail to allow the registration to be found. (2) Deposit Copies . Because of limitations of space, the Copyright Office in the twentieth century has employed the policy of keeping deposits only for a limited time (normally three or five years) and then transferring them to the Library of Congress for disposal, with the result that there is no complete set of copyright deposits in existence. The only exceptions are certain categories of unpublished materials, particularly music and drama; since unpublished typescripts of plays are accepted for copyright, it was felt that all the typescripts should be retained. These plays, dating from the creation of Class D in 1901, are now housed in the Library of Congress (where they form a largely untapped body of material for the history of American drama and a substantially neglected source of unpublished titles for bibliographies of American dramatists). 36 The general policy of disposing of deposits was changed in 1959, however, and from that date forward single copies of deposits were to be kept by the Copyright Office as a permanent record (except those that were transferred to the stacks of the Library of Congress). The only deposits, therefore, which are available for examination in the Copyright Office are those from 1959 to the present (they can be recalled, upon request, from storage in Alexandria). The point of interest in this situation is the whereabouts of the earlier deposit copies. Even though a deposit copy may not always represent the earliest form of a book in every respect, it is an interesting bibliographical object simply by virtue of its being an official copy of record. Since the Copyright Office stamps deposits as they are received, deposit copies can almost always be identified; the question is where to look for them. The Library of Congress has on its shelves most of the kinds of deposits with which bibliographers are concerned: in some cases it has both deposit copies, in other cases only one copy, and sometimes neither one. Copies which the Library does not choose for its permanent collections are available to other governmental libraries and to other institutions, according to a general scheme of priorities established by the Exchange and Gift Division of the Library. The result is that copyright deposit copies can turn up any-where, even in secondhand book stores. Obviously such scattered copies are of no value for general reference because one would never know where to look for any particular work. But large or regular transfers of deposits are worth knowing about, since the receiving institutions became in effect small depository libraries for given fields or periods. One of the most important of these arrangements provided for the transfer to the library of Brown University, over a period of nearly thirty years, one of the two deposit copies of every volume of American poetry and drama copyrighted during that time; between 1909 and 1922 alone this transfer amounted to 15,556 volumes. 37 The excellent collection of poetry at Brown thus gains an added dimension as a place where deposit copies can often be found, and it is possible that deposit copies exist there for works no longer present (at least in the form of the original deposit copy) on the shelves of the Library of Congress. Other similar arrangements have prevailed at various periods — certain scientific books were regularly sent to the John Crerar Library, children's books to the University of Illinois, and foreign books to the District of Columbia Public Library; during the first world war many thousands of deposits went to the War Service Library; and in 1930 over 1300 city directories were transferred to the American Antiquarian Society. A complete list of such mass transfers would perhaps be impossible to compile, but bibliographers should at least realize that the Library of Congress is not the only place where deposit copies may be examined. 38 (3) Published Records . The published Catalogue of Copyright Entries (spelled "Catalog" as of 1934) extends throughout this period, and the entire copyright record is available in any good research library. Before 1909 part of the record was excluded from the printed version, since only deposited works were included and not registered titles for which no completed works had been deposited. After 1909, when title registrations were abolished, the record of deposits became at the same time a complete record of copyright entries. It is as simple a matter to look up the publication date, deposit date, or affidavit date for any work copyrighted in the United States since 1909 in the CCE as it is to look the work up in the CBI or the Library of Congress catalogue or any other standard source; why the CCE is used so infrequently by bibliographers is a mystery. From a bibliographical point of view, the only weakness of the CCE is that it does not include the names of the printer and binder of each book, nor the date of completion of printing; this information can be found only in the applications filed in the Copyright Office. Everything else is found in the printed record, including the claimant's name and the registration number. In the second series of CCE (1906-46), bibliographers will generally need to refer only to Part I (Books) and Part II (Periodicals). Beginning with 1909, however, pamphlet and dramatic material was designated as Group 2 of Part I, listed in separate volumes with separate annual indexes; since some works could be classified either way, it is generally wise to check the annual indexes for both Groups 1 and 2. A Group 3, for dramatic compositions, was added in 1928; again, published drama could appear in Groups 1, 2, or 3, and all are worth checking. The annual indexes, by claimant and author, are excellent through 1938, but from 1939 through 1946 they contain only the names of authors, not of claimants, making the CCE less useful during this period for work on publishing history. 39 The war also necessitated certain abbreviations in the scope of each entry: from 1938 through 1945 some of the information available on Library of Congress cards (such as the total pagination) was eliminated, and from 1940 through 1946 the publication date alone (and not the deposit date) was given. In the third series of CCE (1947- ), bibliographers may be interested in Parts 1A (Books), 1B (Pamphlets and Contributions to Periodicals), 2 (Periodicals), 3/4 (Drama and Works for Oral Delivery), and possibly 5 (Music) and 6 (Maps and Atlases). The entries for Part 1 are now arranged alphabetically by authors, obviating an author index, but with two alphabets per year (since there are two semi-annual issues); not until 1951 and 1952 are there claimant indexes, and beginning with 1953 there are cross references, in the same alphabet, from the names of claimants. Only publication dates and registration numbers are given in the third series. Despite a few deficiencies between 1938 and 1951, the CCE is a remarkable work of reference that can serve many bibliographical uses for which it was not originally designed. 40 Bibliographers working in the period after 1909 will find that the American copyright records contain more information of the kind they are seeking than has been preserved in the official records of any other nation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. A Note on English Copyright Records England was the first country to institute statutory copyright, in the famous Statute of Anne of 4 April 1710 (8 Anne, ch. 19). Before that time the closest counterpart to copyright was the control which the Stationers' Company exercised over the printing of books by its members, but this regulation did not resemble the modern concept of copyright, since it was designed as protection for the printer rather than the author. Nevertheless, the requirement of entering titles in an official register maintained by the Stationers' Company has resulted in records of great bibliographical value similar to those which are produced by a system of copyright registration. The registers covering the years 1554 through 1708 were transcribed and published many years ago 41 and are well known to bibliographers, as are the published records of the Court of the Stationers' Company between 1576 and 1640. 42 The bibliographical importance of these materials has long been recognized, and extracts from them were published by J. P. Collier as early as 1853; 43 since that time several important bibliographical publications relating to the period before 1710, by such scholars as Rollins, Greg, and McKenzie, have been based on records at Stationers' Hall. 44 Anyone interested in pursuing the complications of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English copyright should acquaint himself with the papers available in Stationers' Hall, as listed in the Library , 4th ser., VI (1925-26), 349-57, 45 as well as with certain basic work in this area: Harry Ransom has recounted, in historical terms, the operation of English copyright before the act of 1710; 46 Leo Kirschbaum has described "The Stationers' Company in Operation" and has helped to clarify the difficult relationship of registration to both license and copyright; 47 and W. W. Greg has taken up in detail the bibliographical implications of the records of the Stationers' Company. 48 Although problems remain to be solved, it is clear that the essential researches of these and a few other scholars 49 have provided a fuller treatment, from a bibliographical and literary point of view, of this period than of any other in Anglo-American copyright history. The act of 1710 is the principal dividing line in the story of English copyright: it provided for a copyright term of fourteen years, renewable for 14 more (but not clearly established as author's, rather than printer's, copyright until 1769 in Millar v. Taylor ); it made prepublication title entry in the register of the Stationers' Company a statutory requirement; and it stipulated that nine deposit copies be furnished upon demand (for the Royal Library [later the British Museum], the university libraries at Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and St. Andrews, the Library of the King's and Marischal Colleges Aberdeen, Sion College London, and the library of the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh). Although the force of the Stationers' Company declined after the lapsing of the Printing (or Licensing) Act in 1695, 50 the stationers continued, even after the 1710 act, to turn copyright to their own advantage, through trade boycotts and court injunctions. Their contention that common-law copyright still obtained for any work after the expiration of its term of statutory protection was finally invalidated in the case of Donaldson v. Becket (1774), and a stream of cheap reprints followed. 51 The upshot of this situation for bibliographers in search of records is that the "Entry Books of Copies" at Stationers' Hall for the eighteenth century 52 (with a printed index 1710-73, a manuscript index thereafter) are even less full than those for the earlier years: stationers before 1774 considered their copyrights perpetual by common law; after 1798 ( Beckford v. Hood ) they saw that failure to register prevented only suits for the statutory penalties, not the more important suits for damages; and, in addition, they felt that by not registering they were not obligated to provide copies for the depository libraries, even though the Universities Copyright Act of 1775 (15 Geo. III, ch. 53) emphasized the requirement of prepublication registration and deposit. The records at Stationers' Hall from 1814 through 1841 have a slightly different significance for bibliographers: because the 1814 amendment to the copyright law (54 Geo. III, ch. 156) required that entry be made within one month after publication (rather than before publication), only works actually published are listed during this time. The next major revision of the copyright law, the act of 1842 (5 &amp; 6 Vict., ch. 45), made the copyright term 42 years (or the life of the author plus seven years, whichever was longer), and it reenforced the requirement of registration at Stationers' Hall. The copyright registers and related documents which accumulated in the administration of this act, covering the period 1842-1923, are now in the Public Record Office, not Stationers' Hall. The entries in them fall far short of constituting a national bibliography, for understandably many publishers still did not bother with registration; it was not a condition of copyright, and, in case of a suit for infringement, it need be performed only before the actual court proceedings. But the records are worth checking, for American as well as English books, if one keeps in mind the fact that the entry may occur long after the date of publication. Indexes exist for the entire period, in seven segments, giving the date of entry and the date of publication for each work registered. The first five volumes, covering 1842-1907, have been published as the Index of Entries (1896-1907) and are available in many reference libraries; the remaining years, 1907-23, are covered in six unpublished manuscript volumes in the Public Record Office. All eleven are listed here with the index numbers assigned them by the Public Record Office: 1842-1884 (literary): Ind 16908 (titles) 1842-1884 (commercial): Ind 16915 (titles) 1884-1897: Ind 16909 (titles, with author-publisher index) 1897-1902: Ind 16910 (titles, with author-publisher index) 1902-1907: Ind 16911 (titles, with author-publisher index) 1907-1911: Ind 16912 (titles), 16913 (authors), 16914 (publishers) 1911-1923: Ind 20293 (titles), 20294 (authors), 20295 (publishers) These indexes furnish the same information that is available in the original registers; but if one wishes to check the original entries, the next step is to ask at the Assistant's desk in the Long Room for the typewritten Guide to the Records of the Copyright Office (classified as ff. 78), which indicates the dates covered by each of the registers (Ind 5791 through 5869). 53 It is also possible to send for the original copyright entry forms, stored at Ashridge (classified as Copyright 1/567 through 887, and designated by year in the Guide .) After 2 July 1883 copyright assignments are entered separately (Ind 5870-5872, indexed by Ind 6005-6007), as are certain foreign entries after 1854. 54 Other materials from this period in the Public Record Office, particularly papers relating to copyright suits, can furnish publication data of value to bibliographers. By checking the bills of complaint (in C.14) and the cause books (C.32) — as well as the depositions (C.24) and affidavits (C.31) at Ashridge — one can discover, for example, the publication dates of the Routledge piracies of Melville and Irving. The act of 1911 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. V, ch. 46), which made the term of copyright (for unpublished as well as published works) the lifetime of the author plus fifty years, abolished the statutory requirement for registration, although this requirement remained in force in some parts of the United Kingdom (e.g., Canada) through 1923. Voluntary registration was still possible, however, and entries made on this basis since 1 January 1924 are in registers at Stationers' Hall. But the new law retained a provision for deposit, emphasizing the split between registration and deposit which had prevailed throughout English copyright history. A sort of deposit system had existed as early as 1610 in an arrangement Thomas Bodley had made with the Stationers' Company, and the Printing Act of 1662 had required the deposit of three copies (for the Royal Library and the universities at Oxford and Cambridge). The list of nine copies established by the 1710 act was increased by two in 1801 (41 Geo. III, ch. 107), with the addition of Trinity College and the Society of the King's Inns, Dublin; then in 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. IV, ch. 110) the four Scottish universities were removed from the list; and in 1842 (followed by the 1911 act) only six depository libraries were designated: the British Museum, Oxford, Cambridge, Trinity College Dublin, the Library of the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh (after 1925 the National Library of Scotland), and the National Library of Wales. The number of places to look for deposit copies thus varies with the period and, in addition, with the requirements of particular libraries, since copies were to be deposited upon request by the libraries. The necessity of depositing on demand, however, was not limited to registered books; after 1812 the interpretation of the law was that the deposit provision applied to all books published in England, whether or not they were entered at Stationers' Hall. 55 Libraries often mark the date of receipt in books; the British Museum began this practice in 1833 (the exact day from 1837 forward), stamping copyright deposit copies in blue and colonial copyright deposits in black. 56 Since dated deposit copies may exist for books which were never registered, both sources — official registers and depository libraries — should always be checked. English copyright records, at least after 1710, are not particularly complex and for much of the period are conveniently indexed in printed form; at the same time they are not especially full and represent an unpredictable sampling of the national literary output.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI. Some General Considerations Although copyright records are national documents, the operation of a national copyright law can at times produce records of interest to students of another country. Even when the records themselves do not contain information about the publication of foreign works, the international copyright situation is always a principal factor in publishing history. Whenever two countries employ the same language, authors in one country sometimes deliberately publish their works first in the other, in an effort to forestall unauthorized (or "pirated") editions. In regard to English-speaking countries, this situation existed between England and Ireland in the eighteenth century (since the English copyright law did not extend to Ireland until 1801) and between England and the United States in the nineteenth (since the American law did not include English works until 1891). Many famous English books of the nineteenth century were first published in America because, even though the works could not be copyrighted in the United States, the authors could at least gain something from the American market by selling advance sheets to an American publisher; many famous American books were first published in England because American authors could secure English copyrights during most of this period only if they published their works first in England or were residents of England. 57 A great deal of bibliographical and literary research has been directed toward this aspect of copyright history — from I. R. Brussel's Anglo-American First Editions (1935-36) to individual studies of the trans-Atlantic publication of Scott, Marryat, Cooper, Irving, Dickens, Tennyson, Longfellow, and Mark Twain, 58 among others. But copyright records are not involved, except when a country allows foreign works to be registered or deposited. American titles do appear in the nineteenth-century British records; but foreign titles are listed in the American records (under authority of the 1891 act) beginning at different times for different countries: copyright privileges were extended to some countries (e.g., France and England in 1891, Germany and Italy in 1892) by individual Presidential proclamations, to others (China, Hungary, Thailand) by bilateral treaties, and to still others through the Mexico City Convention (after 1908), the Buenos Aires Convention (after 1914), and the Universal Copyright Convention (after 1955). 59 Despite the differences between the English and American copyright laws and records, the two countries have held the same basic traditions of copyright. The English concept of perpetual common-law copyright in unpublished work and limited statutory copyright in published work (implying that copyright is not a natural right of authorship), established in Donaldson v. Becket (1774), formed the tradition inherited by the United States and supported judicially in Wheaton v. Peters (1834). The philosophy of copyright which exists in any country naturally affects the kinds of records that accumulate, but not their thoroughness, for compulsory registration and deposit are not necessarily tied to statutory provisions for limited-term copyright. Further-more, official copyright information not found elsewhere may be embodied in court decisions; thus the judicial process by which a national attitude toward copyright is evolved serves at the same time to record specific facts about the individual books which occasioned the decisions. Changes in the law or its interpretation may not always result in changes, from a practical point of view, in the bibilographer's approach to the records; but since the records are a creation of the law, shifts in policy will usually alter the theoretical significance of particular inclusions or omissions. The most striking conceptual change, since the Statute of Anne, was effected in the 1911 British act by removing unpublished works from the realm of common law; a similar provision has been proposed in the copyright revision bill in the United States (H.R. 2512, S. 597, 90th Congress, 1st session). 60 If this bill is passed as presently written, all works, unpublished as well as published, come within the scope of statutory protection, and the term of copyright is the same for both — the life of the author plus fifty years. Bringing unpublished works under the statute and basing the term of protection on the author's lifetime will result in the recording of useful biographical information for literary historians. Both registration and deposit, however, are specifically stated not to be conditions of copyright protection. Registration is permissive rather than compulsory and may be performed at any time during the term of copyright (though it is a prerequisite for a suit for infringement); deposit of two copies within three months of publication is requested for the Library of Congress (enforceable upon the Register's demand). Under these regulations, most copyright holders will see the value of prompt registration and deposit, and the bibliographer will find no great change in the information he can derive from the records. At the same time, the view that copyright protection is not dependent upon any administrative technicalities of registration — with the consequent permissive nature of the registration procedure — means that the records which the bibliographer searches fall short, by legal definition, of constituting a list of all copyrighted works. Bibliographers and literary historians do not often have the opportunity to document their research with sworn testimony, and evidence from copyright records therefore comes to the scholar with a kind of guarantee he rarely encounters. Information in the American Catalogue of Copyright Entries , for example, can be presented as prima facie evidence in a court of law; thus when a currently unlocated book is recorded as having been deposited on a particular day, the bibliographer, even though he may wish he personally could see the book, has the strongest assurance that it did actually exist at that time. No materials except official documents can carry such authority, and for this reason copyright records are a uniquely important source for the bibliographer. The English and American records, as described here, vary from period to period in their completeness, but it is evident that copyright registration has been carried out more punctiliously and in greater detail in the United States than in England and that the American records, especially after 1870, constitute an unparalleled storehouse of bibliographical facts. The Copyright Office of the Library of Congress should be familiar territory to every bibliographer; as a center for bibliographical research into American books (and many foreign ones after 1891), there is no other place equal to it. 61 The convenience of using the English and American copyright records has been greatly increased by the publication of substantial portions of them. Even when published indexes do not carry the official sanction which the Catalogue of Copyright Entries does, they serve a useful purpose. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the remaining sections of these records can be published, either as official governmental projects or as separate volumes prepared by individual scholars. For English copyright, the Bibliographical Society has undertaken to publish part of the remaining records, beginning with David Foxon's edition of the Register for 1710-46; for the rest of the period before 1842 and after 1907, at least the kind of index which has been published to cover the years from 1842 through 1907 should be made generally available. As for the American records, the two unpublished segments present different problems. The record books from 1870 to 1891, which are complete and orderly, offer little difficulty; the essential facts in each entry could be transcribed and indexed (perhaps in a form similar to Dramatic Compositions ), and the resulting volumes could be issued seriatim . But for the district court records, from 1790 to 1870, all the surviving documents (including the title pages) should be thoroughly indexed on cards before any volumes are published, since the nature and physical arrangement of these materials are such that information relevant to one period and state can turn up at a number of places. The published entries could then be arranged chronologically by states, with one master-index, or else the master-index itself could be constructed to contain the information from the entries: the most important requirement is that all titles registered in any given period, regardless of the state in which the registration took place, eventually be brought together in one alphabet. Such projects, though expensive and time-consuming, are justifiable and desirable. The publication of these entries would facilitate and stimulate bibliographical and historical research into the Anglo-American cultural heritage; it would also insure the preservation of the most detailed official record ever produced of a nation's literary and artistic product.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT COPYRIGHT RECORDS, 1790-1870 A. Records in the Library of Congress The following inventory of the records now located in the Rare Book Division of the Library of Congress has been prepared as an aid to bibliographers who wish to check the copyright facts about a particular book but have no idea what sort of record exists for the period and district involved. Dates given by month or day below refer to the original entry books; those given only by years are the "duplicates" (often submitted in yearly batches), which may consist of full copies of the original entries, or of abbreviated lists, or of both. Records of copyright assignments, when kept in separate volumes from the title entries, are indicated by "A." The approximate size of each record is suggested by the number of volumes, but considerable quantities of material remain as unbound sheets (indicated by "u"). For the original volumes the presence (+) or absence (-) of three characteristics is recorded: whether they usually contain copy-deposit dates after 1831 (D) in addition to title-entry dates; whether they occasionally have printed title pages and labels pasted in (T); and whether they are indexed (I) by names of proprietors and/or authors (n) or by titles (t). The "duplicates" usually lack all three of these features, and exceptions may occasionally be found in the original volumes to the general attributes assigned them here: Alabama (Mobile): 1837, 1839, 1858-59 (u).

      <field name="fulltext">Notes * Among the many persons to whom I am indebted for assistance, I wish particularly to express my gratitude to Joseph W. Rogers for his generous interest and encouragement over several years; he and Waldo H. Moore have demonstrated that the United States Copyright Office is a place which welcomes scholarly researchers with courtesy and understanding. For a careful reading of the manuscript, I am grateful not only to Mr. Rogers and Mr. Moore but also to Elizabeth K. Dunne and Benjamin W. Rudd of the Copyright Office; for additional help, I wish to thank Frederick R. Goff and Roger J. Trienens of the Library of Congress and Donald W. Krummel and Richard Colles Johnson of The Newberry Library. 1 The fullest listing is Henriette Mertz, Copyright Bibliography (1950); the earlier standard list (still useful) is Thorvald Solberg's "A Bibliography of Literary Property" in R. R. Bowker's Copyright : Its Law and Its Literature (1886). Since June 1953 a current bibliography has appeared in each issue of the Bulletin of the Copyright Society of the U. S. A. Among the prominent earlier writers on copyright were Augustine Birrell, William Morris Colles, George Ticknor Curtis, F. S. Drone, E. J. Macgillivray, George Haven Putnam, and Thorvald Solberg (specific titles can be checked in the Mertz bibliography); more recent treatments include such books as R. R. Shaw's Literary Property in the United States (1950) and Benjamin Kaplan's An Unhurried View of Copyright (1967). Two standard works, continually revised, are W. A. Copinger, Copyright , ed. F. E. and E. P. Skone James (10th ed., 1965), and Melville B. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright (loose leaf, 1963- ). 2 This paper has been printed three times, under slightly different titles: as "Records in the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress Deposited by the United States District Courts, 1790-1870," in PBSA , XXXI (1937), 81-101; as Records in the Copyright Office Deposited by the United States District Courts Covering the Period 1790-1870 (Government Printing Office, 1939); and as "Records of the United States District Courts, 1790-1870, Deposited in the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress," Annual Report of the American Historical Association for the Year 1937 (1939), pp. 93-106. 3 College and Research Libraries , VII (1946), 34-40, 44. Hellmut Lehmann-Haupt, in The Book in America (2nd ed., 1951), also recognized the copyright records as "bibliographical source material of first-rate importance" (p. 202). 4 In the Lyell Lectures for 1966; see his "Firma Tauchnitz 1837-1900," Book Collector , XV (1966), 423-36. Matthew J. Bruccoli spoke on "Transatlantic Texts" before the Bibliographical Society on 15 March 1966. 5 This act was in response to a petition by John Usher; see Evans 168 and Copyright Enactments (1963), p. 140. For a Massachusetts bill exactly one century later, see Rollo G. Silver, "Prologue to Copyright in America," Studies in Bibliography , XI (1958), 259-62. 6 Webster described his efforts to promote copyright laws in the various states in "Origin of the Copy-right Laws in the United States," in A Collection of Papers on Political, Literary and Moral Subjects (1843), pp. 173-78; see also Harry Warfel, Noah Webster : Schoolmaster to America (1936), pp. 54-60. 7 The full texts of these laws, as well as all the later federal copyright laws, are conveniently brought together in Copyright Enactments : Laws Passed in the United States since 1783 Relating to Copyright (Copyright Office Bulletin No. 3, 1900; revised 1963). The original printings of these state laws are listed there, following the text of each act; many of the laws have been reprinted in later compilations of state documents, where additional related material is sometimes available. The state copyright acts of Georgia, North and South Carolina, and Virginia are also reprinted in A Documentary History of Education in the South before 1860 , ed. Edgar Wallace Knight, II (1950), 52-63. A general survey of the provisions of the state laws is Karl Fenning's "Copyright before the Constitution," Publishers' Weekly , CXIV (1928), 1336-38, reprinted in the Journal of the Patent Office Society , XVII (1935), 379-85. 8 Since these dates do not appear in the books themselves and since the Law and Lewis works are not among the indexed copyrights in the Connecticut Archives, I have been unable to discover Trumbull's source for this information. 9 The Public Records of the State of Connecticut , ed. Charles J. Hoadly, III (1922), 537-38. See Irving Lowens, "Copyright and Andrew Law," PBSA , LIII (1959), 150-59; "Andrew Law and the Pirates," Journal of the American Musicological Society , XIII (1960), 206-23, reprinted in his Music and Musicians in Early America (1964). 10 Charles R. Hildeburn, in The Issues of the Press of Pennsylvania (1885-86), lists this work (entry 4591) and states that it is the earliest example of American copyright he has encountered. 11 I wrote to officials in each of the states involved on 30 January 1967 and received replies in each case to the effect that no pre-1790 state copyright materials were now known to exist in their archives. J. H. Whitty reported as long ago as 1911, in his Record of Virginia Copyright Entries ( 1790-1844 ), that "No records have been discovered of State copyright entries in Virginia" (p. 5). The Catalogue of Records of the Office of the Secretary of State for New York (1898) mentions some miscellaneous papers relating to copyrights by the Secretary of State (p. 133), which may have been the pre-1790 records, but these papers apparently no longer survive. 12 Cited by Irving Lowens, PBSA , LIII (1959), 153. 13 See Copyright in Congress 1789-1904 , ed.

Evans 21394, 21978, 22090, and 22192. 14 The loose title pages are now housed in 92 boxes (in the Rare Book Division of the Library of Congress), arranged chronologically and then alphabetically within the year. But a number of them, especially for well-known authors, have been removed from their proper place and put in a single miscellaneous box; in addition, two boxes and one folder of title pages are shelved with the record books, and some title pages can be found among the correspondence. 15 Goff, "Almost Books," New Colophon , I (1948), part 2, pp. 125-33; Trienens, "Copyright Deposit Title Pages of American Medical Books, 1790-1820," Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences , XX (1965), 59-62, which supplements Robert B. Austin's Early American Medical Imprints 1668-1820 (1961). 16 This information is also available in the record books, of course. Wright comments on his use of copyright evidence in "In Pursuit of American Fiction," in Bibliography : Papers Read at a Clark Library Seminar, May 7, 1966 (1966), pp. 41-45, as well as in American Fiction 1774-1850 (rev., 1948), p. x. Louis C. Karpinski, in his Bibliography of Mathematical Works Printed in America through 1850 (1940), includes a separate section of 105 "entry titles" known only through the copyright records (pp. 551-64). 17 The copyright proprietor, if not the author himself, was generally the publisher but could also be the printer or someone else acting on behalf of the author. 18 That is, the announced date on which a work was to be made available to the public, which is not synonymous with the date of completion of printing, though occasionally the two may in fact be identical. 19 Although the notice was not legally required until 1 January 1803, a number of books published between 1790 and 1802 included such a notice, since it was to the proprietor's advantage to announce his copyright. For example, Elihu Hubbard Smith's anthology American Poems , Selected and Original (1793) carried a line on its title page which read, "The Copyright secured as the Act directs"; and Hannah Foster's The Coquette (1797) included a notice similar to the kind that was later required, with the precise date of copyright entry. 20 That is, if the copy is the one originally deposited with the district court. Later provisions, explained below, required additional deposits, and there is no reason why the deposit date in a copy originally deposited in the Library of Congress has to match the date on which another copy was deposited at the district court. 21 On the deposit requirements for this period, see Elizabeth K. Dunne, "Deposit of Copyrighted Works," Copyright Law Revision Studies , No. 20 (1960), pp. 11-13. 22 Deposit copies do still turn up, on rare occasions, in the libraries of these two Departments, but the bulk of them was transferred according to law. On 1 March 1967 I checked the stacks of the State Department library and could find no deposit copies; the small size of the American literature section indicates in itself that the deposits, in this area at least, are no longer there, and the few pre-1870 volumes of literary interest show no signs of being deposit copies. The printed Catalogue of the Library of the Department of State (1825; rev., 1830) undoubtedly includes books received as copyright deposits, but the sources of the books are not indicated. 23 These three works have been discussed by Joseph W. Rogers in U.S. National Bibliography and the Copyright Law (1960), pp. 11-29; and more briefly by Elizabeth K. Dunne and Rogers in "The Catalog of Copyright Entries," Copyright Law Revision Studies , No. 21 (1960), pp. 55-57. 24 Roberts gives a similar list ( PBSA , XXXI, 97-101), but I have felt it useful to go over this ground again because additional material has turned up since the time of his article. In particular, an examination of the miscellaneous bundles furnishes a surprising amount of new material — for example, Roberts's list gives 1845 as the beginning date for the Savannah records, but one of the miscellaneous binders contains the entries for 1800-44. Anyone wishing to refer to the unbound sheets may have a difficult time locating certain of the years as specified in Appendix A because the sheets for a particular district may turn up among the loose papers in several different binders or envelopes. Since the records are not catalogued, it is impossible to make specific citations; some of the binders and envelopes have a pencilled number on the outside but no identification numbers for the sheets enclosed; others have no identification of any sort. 25 See also Richard S. MacCarteney, "Some Records Dealing with or Related to Copyright, Located Outside the Copyright Office" [1963], a 10-page memorandum in the Copyright Office Library. 26 The Richmond entries for 1790-1844 were transcribed by James H. Whitty from a group of title pages then in the possession of Judge Robert W. Hughes. Whitty's transcription appeared in 1911 in two separate editions (see Appendix C); therefore, since it was set in type twice, there may be some discrepancies between the two editions (though a spot check has revealed none), and both should always be consulted. H. R. McIlwaine, then the State Librarian, prefaced Whitty's work by saying, "Undoubtedly, some errors have crept in in the copy made by Mr. Whitty, and the absence of the original records has made it impossible to correct them." For discussion of a Confederate copyright trial, see Thomas Conn Bryan, "General William J. Hardee and Confederate Publication Rights," Journal of Southern History , XII (1946), 263-74. Entry dates for individual authors have sometimes been cited, as Charles Feinberg does for Whitman in PBSA , LII (1958), 91. 27 The authors covered are T. B. Aldrich, J. S. C. Abbott, Boucicault, G. W. Curtis, Emerson, Stephen Foster, G. S. Hilliard, Hawthorne, Holmes, J. G. Holland, Irving, J. H. Ingraham, Longfellow, Lowell, D. G. Mitchell, Motley, Parkman, E. S. Phelps, H. B. Stowe, J. G. Saxe, E. C. Stedman, Bayard Taylor, Whittier, A. D. T. Whitney, and Susan and Anna Warner; also there was a page for the Webster dictionaries and one for the ninth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica . 28 Renewal entries can occasionally be located for works originally registered in a district court office for which the records no longer survive; on the other hand, one sometimes finds renewal entries quite close to the original entries, in cases where a proprietor (who had printed a copyright notice in his book) had failed to register or deposit his work until the time for renewal had almost arrived. 29 Kenneth E. Carpenter, in "Copyright Renewal Deposit Copies," PBSA , LX (1966), 473-74, discusses seventeen such items produced by Houghton Mifflin (for books by William Dean Howells) and cites further examples of this practice by Henry Holt &amp; Co. The regulations for renewing copyrights at this time are thoroughly explained by Thorvald Solberg in Directions for Securing Copyrights (Copyright Office Bulletin No. 2, 1899). 30 Students of typography would be interested in the title-page collection, but less so than in the preceding period, partly because it contains few examples of early printing in various localities and partly because commercial prints and labels form no part of it after 1874. Between 1874 and 1940, commercial prints and labels were deposited and registered in the Patent Office; in 1940 the registration of these works was transferred to the Copyright Office, where it has since remained. When the transfer of function was made in 1940, a transfer of the complete Patent Office files of these materials, including the deposit copies, also took place. Following the transfer, the Copyright Office continued the Patent Office's methods of handling such materials until April 1947. The Copyright Office continues to preserve these files; consequently a substantially complete collection of original deposit copies of commercial prints and labels registered in the Patent Office or Copyright Office between 1874 and April 1947 is available. Since 1947 this material has been subject to the disposal routines mentioned below. 31 A useful survey of the card indexes is Dorothy Arbaugh's "The Card Files Comprising the Copyright Card Catalog," a mimeographed paper (dated January 1962) for the use of the Copyright Office staff. 32 The deposit of unpublished typescripts of dramatic works, one of the most interesting features of the period after 1901, is commented on below in connection with deposit copies. One other cumulative catalogue of copyrights has been published for this period, Howard Lamarr Walls's Motion Pictures 1894-1912 (1953), but its subject matter limits its usefulness for bibliographers. Three more volumes have appeared, covering 1912-39 (1951), 1940-49 (1953), and 1950-59 (1960). One use of Dramatic Compositions is illustrated by Paul T. Nolan's "Alabama Drama, 1870-1916: A Check List," Alabama Review , XVIII (1965), 65-72; and by Edgar Heyl's "Plays by Marylanders, 1870-1916," beginning in Maryland Historical Magazine , LXII (1967), 438-47. 33 For a further description of the Catalogue of Copyright Entries during this period, see Rogers, pp. 47-70; Dunne and Rogers, pp. 57-58. 34 For a discussion of the bibliographical usefulness of this British regulation, instituted in the act of 12 July 1799, see William B. Todd, "London Printers' Imprints, 1800-1840," Library , 5th ser., XXI (1966), 46-59 (with an appendix, pp. 60-62, by Paul Morgan, on provincial imprints, 1799-1869). 35 The fact that the card catalogues are arranged in sequences of years which overlap these changes of form causes no difficulty when one is using them. There are the separate claimant and author files for each class between 1898 and 1937, followed by general claimant-author-title alphabets for 1938-45, for 1946-54, and for 1955 to the present. These indexes are described by Dorothy Arbaugh in the mimeographed paper cited above. 36 The titles of these works through 1916 are of course included in Dramatic Compositions Copyrighted . . . 1870 to 1916 (1916-18), discussed above. 37 Report of the Librarian of Congress for . . . 1923 , p. 151.

Although British publishers were often willing to pay for advance sheets of American works (just as American publishers did for English books), the legal status of any copyright claim thus secured was not at all clear. The English law of 1838 granted copyright protection to foreign works only on a reciprocal basis, and, since the United States did not provide for copyright of English works, copyrighting an American work in England appeared to be technically impossible. Sir Frederick Pollock reaffirmed this view in Boosey v. Purday (5 June 1849), opening the way for the Routledge piracies of 1850. In 1854 prior publication was regarded as a means of securing English copyright only if the author was present in the United Kingdom at the time of publication (the reason for certain American authors' "Canadian copyrights" later in the century). 58 David A.

      <field name="heading_text">The Lay of the Case by Philip Gaskell</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Introductory The lay of the case for the Latin alphabet — that is, the conventional order in which sorts of roman, italic or gothic type are arranged in the boxes of the type-case, and the organization of the cases themselves — is found today in two main forms. One form, which may be called the single lay, is associated with the German-speaking countries and Scandinavia; the other, which we may call the divided lay, is associated with the English-speaking countries, and with France and the Low Countries. The single lay, as used for instance in Germany and Switzerland, employs one large case for a fount of type, with proportions of about 1:1.6 giving it a somewhat square appearance. The capital letters are arranged in rows of equal-sized boxes along the top of the case, and the small letters are in boxes of various sizes beneath them (Fig. 1). The divided lay in its original form is fast disappearing, although examples may still be seen in old-fashioned printing houses in France, England and elsewhere. Here there are two similar cases to a fount, each of them being smaller and more oblong (with proportions of about 1:2) than the single-lay case. Capital letters are in the 'upper case' boxes, which are all of a size, and the small letters are in the variously sized boxes of the 'lower case' (Fig. 2). Nowadays, however, type in cases (where metal type is still in use) is needed only for correction, and the twin cases of the divided lay are normally amalgamated into one double or job case; the Anglo-American version of the double case is the same shape and size as each of the cases of the divided pair, but squeezes the whole of the lower-case pattern into two-thirds of its width, and half of the upper-case pattern into the remaining third (Fig. 3). It is apparent from early evidence that both the single lay and the divided lay derive from parent forms which were established by the late seventeenth century in the regions where they are found today. This evidence is of three main sorts. First, there are early illustrations of printing houses, which often show the compositor working at his case. Most of the sixteenth-century cuts are unfortunately very crude in execution, and they never show details of the lay; they may, however, give some idea of the gross form of the case. Secondly, there are printers' manuals, which do give details of actual lays from the later seventeenth century onwards. They offer the best evidence of all, provided that it is remembered that individual printers are likely to have varied the patterns of their lays in minor respects. Finally, a few type cases, sometimes laid with old type, survive from the hand-press period. Their evidence must be treated with caution because, although they may tell us how their earlier owners laid them, it is also possible that they have been altered in later times.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The single lay The earliest evidence, illustrations of printing houses, suggests that the single lay preceded the divided lay. The first illustration of all, which shows a French printing-house at the end of the fifteenth century, is unambiguous in its representation of the compositor's case: it is a single case, not a pair, and it is more square than oblong 1 (Fig. 4). Since French printers were using the divided lay by the early eighteenth century, not the single lay, the implication of this picture is that the single lay is the earlier. The illustrations of the sixteenth century, poor as they mostly are, tend to confirm this suggestion: all appear to represent single cases, not pairs. 2 The best of them, Froschauer's cut of 1548, 3 certainly shows a single case, but this does not tell us as much as the French illustration, since Froschauer printed in German-speaking Zürich, where the single lay remained in use. One other pointer to the priority of the single lay (although admittedly a slight one) is that Plantin in his Dialogues of 1567 referred to ' la casse ' in the singular, not the plural, 4 and (as will be shown later) the divided lay subsequently became standard both in the Low Countries in general and at the Plantinian printing house in particular. The single lay was first shown in detail in Georg Wolffger's New-auffgesetztes Format-büchlein , published at Graz in 1672. 5 Wolffger actually illustrated two single lays, one for gothic and the other for roman type. The gothic lay (Fig. 5) is closely paralleled by two more single lays for gothic type shown in the Leipzig manual of J. F. Gessner, published in 1740 (Figs. 6, 7). 6 In each of these lays the boxes are arranged in four groups, and Gessner's plates show that the groups were divided by structural bars thicker than the ordinary divisions between the boxes. The top group consists of three or four rows of boxes running the full width of the case, and containing the capital letters, figures, suspensions, etc. Then in the centre are three rows of four large boxes (one of them subdivided) for the more frequently-used small letters of the alphabet (a d e i m n o t u r v w) and for spaces. The other two groups of boxes, on either side of the centre group, contained the remaining small letters, with ligatures and punctuation marks outside them and quads in the lower right-hand corner. The total number of boxes is 109 in Wolffger's lay, and 102 and 108 respectively in Gessner's two lays. One of Gessner's plates also gives the dimensions of his case: it measured 47½ by 29½ in. (1.210 by 0.750 m.). 7 Wolffger's lay for roman type was essentially similar to the gothic lay, but it needed a larger number of boxes to accommodate the additional small capitals and accented sorts (Fig. 8). These were provided by further subdivision of the boxes, and by including extra rows of boxes at the top and bottom of the case, making a total of 158. Another single lay for roman type was illustrated soon afterwards in the Frankfurt manual of Vietor and Redinger; 8 and although Frankfurt is 400 miles away from Graz, this lay with its 151 boxes is strikingly similar to Wolffgers' roman lay (Fig. 9). Vietor and Redinger do not illustrate a gothic lay, saying merely 'Der Teutscher Kasten ist fast wie dieser Lateinischer'; but the chances are that their gothic lay would also have been very like Wolffger's. The capital letters in the top rows of all these single lays are in alphabetical order; and it is not very difficult to see that the small letters are also arranged in an approximation of alphabetical order. Thus the bottom row of small letters has b c a, then e d, then g f (or f g): in other words the letters a to g rearranged to get the commoner letters into the centre. The next line up has k h l, then m i n o, then p q, which similarly gives the letters h to q with the commoner letters in the large central boxes. Lastly the upper line of small letters has s t u, then r, then v (w) x y z, completing the alphabet and getting r into the middle. The underlying alphabetical order of the small letters therefore reads from left to right, and from bottom to top, just as the compositor reads type in his stick. It is tempting to suppose that there may originally have existed a primitive single lay, with the capital letters across the top and the small letters arranged alphabetically beneath them in three rows of eight boxes (Fig. 10). Of course this 'ur-lay' is entirely hypothetical; and, even if anything like it did exist, it cannot have been long before printers saw the convenience of making the changes that would have resulted in the single lay of the seventeenth century.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The divided lay English printers were referring to 'pairs' of cases as early as 1588, but the earliest certain evidence for the existence of the divided lay is in a fine plate of a Dutch printing house of 1628 9 (Fig. 11). Two pairs of cases are clearly shown, and even the shapes and sizes of the boxes are indicated without much diagrammatic simplification. Next comes Joseph Moxon's less artistic but even more informative plate of 1683 10 (Fig. 12), the first illustration to show the divided lay in detail. Moxon's lay, although certainly intended for roman type, is unusual in that it lacks small capitals (Moxon has accented letters and zodiacal signs instead), and it will be convenient to consider it in connection with the next English illustration of the divided lay, which was included in Smith's manual of 1755, 11 and which is probably more typical of English practice (Fig. 13). The two cases of the divided English lay each measured about 33 in. by 16½ in. (0.838 m. by 0.419 m.), and each was divided into halves by a vertical structural bar. Each half of the upper case was divided into seven rows of seven boxes (making 98). The lower case was not arranged in halves but as a unit, with about 56 boxes of various sizes. The total number of boxes was thus about 154, much the same as in the single-lay roman cases. The upper case contained capitals on the left and small capitals on the right, all in alphabetical order (with the exception of J and U, the alternatives in Latin of I and V), together with figures, various odd sorts and symbols, and the small letter k. The lower case had the rest of the small letters, the punctuation marks and the spaces, arranged so that the commonest letters come in the middle. The next illustration of the divided lay after Moxon was the French version of Fertel, published in 1723 12 (Fig. 14). This lay is very like the English divided lay, except that W is omitted from the upper-case alphabets; the figures are in the lower case; h is put out beyond g; short s is down beside long f; and i is in Moxon's h-box. This French lay is shown again, with minor variants, in the Encylopédie ; 13 and it seems likely that a version of the divided lay similar to the French pattern — that is with i, not h, in the middle of the lower case — was also used in Spain, although it was not illustrated until 1811. 14 We have already seen that a divided lay was used in a Dutch printing house in 1628; and the fact that Moxon (who trained as a printer in Holland from 1637 to 1643 and who was an admirer of Dutch printing technology) did not mention the single lay also argues for the general use of the divided lay in seventeenth-century Holland. There were no early Dutch printers' manuals, however, and the earliest evidence we have of the details of a Low Countries lay is in the old type cases preserved at the Plantin-Moretus Museum at Antwerp. All of them are divided lays, with a general similarity to the French version, but they fall into two groups which differ from each other chiefly in the upper case. One, which appears on the evidence of the age of the cases to be the younger of the two groups of lays, differs very little from the French lays shown by Fertel and in the Encyclopédie . The other Plantinian lay, which would appear to be the older, again has a 'French' lower case, but the upper case has only six rows of seven boxes in each half, with the top two rows on the left-hand side subdivided and laid with small capitals (Fig. 15). This immediately suggests a comparison with the Haarlem plate of 1628, where the same unusual pattern is seen in the upper case of the left-hand pair; and it may also be significant of early date that the supposedly older Plantinian lay has accented letters in the right-hand half of its upper case in much the same way shown by Moxon. 15 Virtually nothing is known about the lay of the case in Italy during the hand-press period, which is particularly regrettable in view of the importance of the Italian contribution to early printing technology. A divided lay is shown in a manual of 1873; it is of course poor evidence of early Italian practice, but it is worth considering because it differs from the other divided lays 16 (Fig. 16). The upper case, which is smaller than the lower, has only four rows of eight boxes in each half (some of them subdivided); but it is the lower case which has the most remarkable variants, with r and s in the middle row, and o in what elsewhere is the e box, e being moved to the right; h and i are in the 'French' positions, while a and the space box are interchanged. Just as a general alphabetical pattern was found in the single lays of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, so the early divided lays show analogous patterns. The capitals and small capitals in the upper case are straightforwardly alphabetical, but for J and U and (except in England) W. The lower case is less obviously organized, but once again the pattern is in fact based on alphabetical order. Considering first the French lower case (Fig. 14), which is virtually the same as the Plantinian lower case, we find in the next to top row b c d e f g h, with intrusive s and long f; then in the next row the series i l m n o p q, altered only by the placing of the i in the middle. The order in the bottom row, surprisingly, runs from right to left, not from left to right, completing the alphabet with r t u v x y z, the space box and a being intrusive. Three further letters, not used in Latin, are out of series: these are j k and w. The English version of the divided lay (which also makes special arrangements for j, k and w) differs in two major respects from the French pattern: h, a commoner letter in English than in French and most other European languages, is kept in the centre of the lower case, the i being in what is otherwise the s box, and s going into the top row; and y, also common in English, is moved to the middle. The fact that the English version of the lower case departs further from alphabetical order than the French may suggest that it is the later of the two. By a similar process of reasoning, the position of r and s in the middle row of the nineteenth-century Italian lay, which brings it nearer to alphabetical order, might be an indication of early origin. But we should not be tempted to postulate a primitive form of the divided lower case. A single origin it may have had, but hardly one that was strictly alphabetical. If, as the evidence suggests, the divided lay was developed after the single lay, then it may well have been deliberately designed for its purpose by a practical man who put the letters of the lower case in the most convenient places, taking alphabetical order as his starting point but altering it wherever necessary. What then can have been the purpose of developing a divided lay? Here we can only speculate, but it has been mentioned that the single lay case was very large; Gessner's was 4 ft wide, and it would have weighed about 75 lb (34 kilos) when it was full of type. To divide it into two would be an obvious device, and indeed there survive in Sweden some old cases of the single-lay pattern which are divided vertically up the middle. 17 But this could be inconvenient — each half of such a pair contains only half the capitals and half the small letters, and would be useless by itself — and a horizontal division of all the capitals into one case and all the small letters into another would commend itself as being more practical. The result, at any rate, is a pair of cases which are each of a convenient size and which weigh, when they are full, no more than 30 lb (13 kilos) apiece.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Oxford Old-Spelling Shakespeare Concordances by T. H. Howard-Hill</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although a few computer-generated concordances to the works of English authors have been published, not much progress has been made with the computation of Shakespeare. Professor Bowers's remarks in On Editing Shakespeare (1966) and Professor Louis Marder's evangelistic comments from time to time in Shakespeare Newsletter have fallen on stony ground. The reason is not hard to seek. On E. K. Chambers's count, the average length of the thirty-seven canonical Shakespearian plays is 2,720 lines. In the typographical lines of the First Folio, the plays range from The Comedy of Errors with 1,920 lines to Hamlet with over 3,900. Such an extent of material imposes serious and often inhibiting demands on even the largest computing systems, while the problems encountered in preparing the texts and in arranging for a properly legible concordance are great. One must admire the selfless industry with which the editors of earlier concordances to Shakespeare worked from manually-transcribed paper slips, despite the considerable deficiencies of these works. Their inadequacies are too familiar to require rehearsal here. The nature of John Bartlett's concordance, a modern spelling concordance to the Old Cambridge Shakespeare in a single alphabet, is only remotely germane to the present subject, but his 1,910 pages set in 6 point, with 110 lines in each column, clearly illustrates how greatly the problem of scale affects the study of Shakespeare's plays by computer. Had I appreciated properly the extent of the undertaking before I began work on the Old-Spelling Concordances for the Clarendon Press, no doubt my enthusiasm would have been short-lived. However, for some years, study of spellings as evidence for the derivation of printed texts from scribal or holographic copy had reinforced my view that a swifter advance in the thorough analysis of Shakespeare's texts would come, not from the partial study of problems of individual texts, with inadequate understanding of how related evidence from other texts might affect conclusions, but from the detailed study of features common to many texts. There was nothing original in this conclusion: it will be generally agreed that hypotheses which are grounded on a suitably-thorough study of the facts are more likely to survive the examination of time and scholarship than those which are not. The means of securing the general survey of Shakespeare's texts, however, which I thought necessary did not exist; for Bartlett's omissions as well as his dependence on an obsolete modern-spelling edition renders his concordance practically useless for the detailed orthographical study which might lead to a better understanding of Shakespeare's text and language. It was essential to have at least a comprehensive and accurate concordance or concordances to the early texts: 'at least' because, although concordances are projected and received with enthusiasm, they are relatively unsophisticated working tools: to use a computer just to produce a concordance seems an indefensible waste of time and resources. For the work on the scribes and compositors which interested me, more elaborate computational routines were essential. Nevertheless, concordances were the obvious starting point, and if they were to be published for the help of all scholars, so much the better. For some time I could do little but contemplate the outlines of the work I wished to pursue; for, until Hinman's monumental Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare was published, detailed investigation was hazardous without the aid of his description of the composition and printing of the Folio. When I found that Hinman had not, as I had hoped, been able to assign all the pages of F with certainty to their respective compositors, it seemed inevitable that old-spelling concordances would have to be produced. These would present all the spelling evidence necessary to settle compositor attribution, and would allow me to get on with my work on Ralph Crane and Edward Knight. The problem was how the concomitant expense, too great for a private student, could be borne. This question was satisfactorily resolved after discussion with Dr. Alice Walker, the editor of the Oxford Old-Spelling Shakespeare, when the Delegates of the Clarendon Press agreed to support publication of old-spelling concordances to each of the texts selected by Miss Walker as copy-texts for her edition, and commissioned me as editor. It may not be clear what information old-spelling concordances can provide that a modern-spelling concordance cannot, and the question will come to mind why the concordances were not made from edited texts. In general terms, an old-spelling text of Shakespeare represents a complex interaction of compositor(s), scribe(s), and, ultimately, author. Each agent of transmission had a function and responsibility partly the same as and partly different from that of the preceding; and each could perform his task with different degrees of accuracy and consistency. Viewed in this light, a Shakespearian text presents a pastiche of textual and orthographical features deriving from the individual links in the transmissional chain. The agents of transmission might vary in importance for consideration of the substantives of the text, but are of equal importance for a consideration of its accidental features, through which alone the substantives can be examined. In a modern-spelling text, or an edited text, a superficial consistency has been given to all textual features, which may or may not have been justified by the distribution and occurrence of the various linguistic forms. The editor works on the basis of variously determined assumptions and conclusions as to what is or what is not 'normal' in a page or text in a particular linguistic environment, and he smooths out what appear to him to be abnormalities, mistakes, or corruptions. The important point here is that abnormalities can only be distinguished by thorough understanding of what is normal, and what is normal for the author, scribe, compositor, or any other hand in the text, is best determined from the whole range of information bearing on the study. Hence, it is hoped, old-spelling concordances of unedited, unsophisticated texts, and subsequent detailed analysis, will not only reveal the normal orthographical and textual tone of the milieu, whether line, column, page, scene, act, or text, but will also throw into relief various abnormal forms for special consideration. Especially interesting are forms which may not demonstrate any particular peculiarity but which are exceptional in the immediate textual environment. Such matters as the creation of anomalous spellings by compositorial justification, or from efforts to make rhymes visual as well as auditory, can be investigated in the concordances. The results of such analysis will be incorporated in the Oxford Old-Spelling Shakespeare, and from this edition will be prepared, one hopes, the definitive single-volume concordance to Shakespeare's plays, in both old- and modern-spelling. In brief, a concordance with pretentions to 'definitiveness' must itself depend on an edition which can itself be called definitive, and such an edition does not yet exist. The concordances of the single plays are intended to provide an important aid towards the definitive edition, which one hopes the Oxford edition will be. The techniques chosen for the preparation of the concordances and the arrangement of material in them have been determined not by any premature aspiration to produce a 'definitive' concordance, but by the more humble wish to afford a means towards the definitive edition . Consequently, the discussion which follows centres less on the nature and function of a concordance envisaged as itself a final product of scholarship, than on the old-spelling concordance as a basic working-tool from which scholars can derive the information they need to work towards the edition which we hope to see in our lifetimes. I begin by discussing the principles and the particular features of the text which determined the structure of the programs for the computer and the organization of the data preparation. Any concordance should aim to provide the fullest possible array of information for the reader and at the same time present a coherent text: a proliferation of editorial symbols is not likely to be helpful, especially when, as in works of early date, the language and typographical conventions of the text may be unfamiliar to many who will use the concordances. No concordance editor could possibly foresee all the uses to which his work might be put as linguistic technique advances; and, indeed, many possible applications would require different and irreconcilable arrangements. Nevertheless, it is desirable so to arrange the concordance that, even if an enquirer cannot immediately find the information he requires, with a little work he can extract it. No industry on his part, however, can compensate for actual omissions of matter, so the foremost desideratum is that a concordance present all the matter embraced by its subject. A concordance to the dramatic works of Shakespeare should therefore include the entire canon, and the texts should be presented in entirety. Even so, the principle of comprehensiveness has obvious reservations which must be faced by editor and user alike: I discuss some of these below in passing. There is, too, the obligation of fidelity to the texts, and there are other desiderata, such as providing sufficiently extensive illustrative contexts for each concorded word, and devising a clear system of referring the user from the item in the concordance to the appropriate place in the original text. These requirements are satisfied at two distinct stages: when the texts are being prepared for presentation to the concordance programs, and when the headings and reference-lines are arranged by the main concordance program. Before I discuss these stages I should note that there are several methods of preparing concordances by computer; the method chosen in any particular case is largely determined by the facilities (including editorial time, and time available on the computer) at the command of the editor. In particular, whether one edits the text before, at an intermediate stage of, or after the main sequence of computer operations is determined by considerations of cost and efficiency. This in its turn determines the extent of editorial intervention off-line, and what is actually carried out by the computer. Usually, one tries to minimize the labours of the editor at any stage, whether the input text is to be pre-edited, or the concorded output is to be post-edited, after the concordance programs have been run, say, by the insertion of special characters which were not available for use in the computer, or by a further arrangement of heading-words. One attempts so to order the procedures that the computer can deal with the text in one passage through the text, without intermediate intervention by the human editor. 1 For Shakespeare, where considerations of scale are especially pertinent, I decided that intermediate editing should be avoided and textual forms which needed distinctive treatment in the concordance should be identified in the text during the preparation of the texts. The computer on which the programs were run, an English Electric KDF9 at the Oxford University Computing Laboratory, at this time was oriented towards paper-tape input, and this determined my choice of the method by which the texts were prepared for computation. Although the computer's core-store consisted of 32,000 machine words, able to hold 192,000 characters, this was not large enough to hold even one text completely in store during computation. Accordingly, magnetic tape operations figure prominently in the concordance programs. The main concordance program is organized to write a file of messages for subsequent sorting and editing during a single passage through the text. As it was uneconomical to require the program to backtrack through the text, any information the program might require to form the appropriate concordance messages for writing to magnetic tape had either to be present in the text itself or be added by the editor during the data preparation. In brief, the concordance program writes a file of messages from the edited texts (held on magnetic tape) in the word-order of the text, on magnetic tape. These messages are then sorted into alphabetical order on to another magnetic tape by a standard program, which allows the editor to control such matters as whether numerals precede or follow letters; and are afterwards combined into the final concordance arrangement by another program, the editing program. The result is a concordance on magnetic tape from which the legible output used by the scholar can be prepared. Partly because this final stage may be quite some time after the generation of the concordance, but chiefly to allay the editor's anxiety (for it is some time since he has had any direct control), there are facilities to enable the concordance to be printed directly to the lineprinter, in legible but unpublishable form. At one time it was thought that the concordances would be printed on a Xeronic printer, which has the large array of upper- and lower-case characters necessary for this work, but ultimately it was decided to filmset them. Therefore, another computer run is necessary to convert the concordance in Xeronic form into a coding which makes film-setting possible. It is generally recognized that the preparation of concordances is no longer a novel application of computers; many programs for concordances in many different programming languages are available. However, no program acceptable to the KDF9 computer has been written which does not impose severe constraints on the characteristics of the input texts, and therefore, on the legibility of the output. None of the published programs at the time when this work was being considered could cope with the particular requirements of early modern dramatic texts which show a fair amount of formal inconsistency, and at the same time preserve all the textual and linguistic features which might be of interest. It was necessary to devise a suite of programs which could handle quite inconsistent material and which would at the same time be able to deal with more orthographically-consistent material in modern English. Accordingly, although the preediting was restricted to the minimum identification of textual features which a computer could not reasonably be expected to distinguish unaided, the editor was able to use special devices in order to deal with the special characteristics of dramatic texts, such as speech-prefixes. 2 I describe these below. The texts were edited on the principle that the typographical environment of the individual text-line should be preserved as faithfully as possible, and much of the pre-editing was devoted to ensuring that the characteristics of the various compositors (in so far as they would be studied in the concordances) were preserved. The typists of the input paper-tapes could not distinguish italic from roman type, and were not competent to deal with word spacing, and clear instructions had to marked on copy. Usually, even though words in long lines are run together in the source texts, they can be separated with reasonable confidence: there seemed no advantage in preserving portmanteau noncewords which were simply the result of the compositor's concern to fit his text to his measure. But for forms such as to day , any body , and your selfe , which might be divided or not, the spacing of the text had to be observed, even though there was reason to suspect that the compositor treated them differently in verse lines. With elisions such as i'th , o'th'King , the narrowness of the spaces did not always allow certainty that the text was marked correctly. Where there was legitimate doubt about the compositor's practice for any particular form, I preferred to space or not according to the evidence of similar forms in the immediate area, that is, to regress to the norm rather than risk creating anomalous forms. There seemed to be no good reason to preserve obvious typographical blemishes such as wrong-fount letters, turned letters, misprints from foul case, and blanks such as Qu ene ) in Ant . The printer's character set did not allow me to preserve compound characters such as tildes, ligatures, digraphs, accents, and the pronominal contractions y e , y t , y u , and w c , occurrences of which have been listed together, I hope not too annoyingly, under Y and W respectively, to avoid confusion with such forms as ye and yt . I vacillated over the conventional abbreviations L. , D. , S. , and M. but finally concluded that the reader would best be served by finding these forms listed under LORD, DUKE, SAINT and so on. I did this by expanding them between parentheses in the text; so, L.(ord) . Faced with the choice of expanding M. or Mist. and the like into their variant spellings, I again consulted the evidence of the full spellings in the area. I retained the contraction when there was no reasonable warrant for expansion, secure in the knowledge that improper expansions will be immediately obvious in the concordance. Tilded forms such as cōuerted are similarly expanded in parentheses to co ( n ) uerted , but I have had to divide digraphs such as Æ silently. I have lowered the superscript r in M r . , forming Mr. , the point being retained. For contracted names such as Bulling , which are often subject to considerable spelling variation, it is less easy to find warrant for expansion in the surrounding text, and I tended to leave them alone, particularly in stage-directions. I intend later to analyze the vocabulary and spellings of stage-directions in order to determine, as it seems reasonable to assume, whether certain arrays of variants occur which might lead to the preliminary grouping of texts dependent upon copy from a common source. Contraction of characters' names in the body of the text is relatively infrequent and whether or not they are expanded is of slight importance: I mention this only because McKerrow and most other editors consider expansion desirable. The proper treatment of misprints gave the greatest concern in the pre-editing stage. The individual volumes contain a list of the particular alterations I have made beyond the general categories mentioned here, but the reader will very likely consider that I have not corrected obvious nonsense assiduously enough, especially when many corruptions are apparent and the corrections are accepted by modern editors. However, my greatest concern in marking up the texts has been to avoid emendation under the guise of correcting compositors' misprints, a task which I did not see as my responsibility. Since misprints which make some sort of sense will be illuminated by the contexts in which they are found under the headings of the concordances, it seems wrong-headed to frustrate more informed emendation by endeavouring to correct them before concording. In general, when a form in the text is a word making any sense at all, I have retained it. The lists printed in each concordance show the sort of correction which I have felt free to make. The asterisk to preface long lines marks the first printable symbol introduced into the text. It is essential that spellings which might have been affected by the compositor's need to fit the line to the span of his measure should be identified; they have been separately counted, and the line in which they occur has been identified by the preliminary asterisk. Where only line numbers are given, the line number is asterisked if I have marked it as a long line. The asterisk signifies not that spellings have been altered, but that they might have been, since they occur in lines which extend to the full extent of the measure. In some texts such as TN. , a compositor has justified many lines without making the text extend right to the margin; although these (and indeed all lines) are 'justified', they have not been marked as such in the concordances. The compositors used many tricks to achieve justification, most of which could have been used with variation of spelling, and I should warn the reader that because a word is not identified as occurring in a long line, it should not be taken for granted that the copy spelling or the compositor's customary spelling has not been varied. I hope to discuss justification more fully in another place. Where the measure varies, as it does in some quartos, this has been noted in the relevant introduction. On the other hand, when run-on prose lines have been justified with a terminal quadrat or space, I have made no special note. The only other common printable symbol introduced into the text is the end-of-line bar. It is unilluminating to concord short lines, which might be vocatives, passages of stychomythia, or single-word turn-overs, as single context lines. The reader who refers to ANGELO in the concordance to MM. will not be pleased to find ' Duke. Angelo : . . . 32'; it is better that he should find ' Duke. Angelo : | There is a kinde of Character in thy life, . . . 32'. Therefore, in order to provide the most efficient context based on the typographical line, short lines have been joined together, or have been attached to longer lines. The end of each line of text is marked by a vertical bar. This device is particularly useful in prose passages where a word has been divided between the end of one line and the beginning of the next (as at Tmp. , l.17: Ma -| ster ?). In such cases, the second part of the word has been joined to the first in order to ensure that the whole word is listed, rather than MA and STER, with the point of division marked by the vertical line. For such divided words, the line number given must obviously refer to that part of the context line up to the end-of-line bar, although when a turn-over is found, as at Tmp. , l.118, '. . . Sit | ( downe ,' the line number refers to the whole line. This case is discussed again with reference to line-numbering. It is not always possible to give a sufficient context under each heading to enable the reader to comprehend the precise circumstances in which each word has been used. Although there is little technical objection to the joining of a large number of lines together, it is not usually economical to do so for too frequent use of this device would expand the concordances excessively. This is one of the points at which the concordance editor who works from slips has an advantage over the computer, for he can exercise his judgment for every case. When the editor has dealt with long lines, italics (marked on paper-tape by a distinctive character before and after the portions of the text which are to be in italic fount in the final out-put), the linking of short lines together in order to enlarge the context line quoted under the headings, the expansion of contractions, correction of misprints, and the clarification of any matters such as word-division which might trouble the typist, he has still to consider the text in relation to the kind of arrangement he desires to achieve, and his obligation to present all available material. There are categories of words where the information conveyed by the full contextual reference would hardly warrant the consequent uneconomical expansion of the concordance were they to be included in full. Such words might be a , of , and the . One must balance here the partly conflicting factors of economy and utility. To provide full contextual references is uneconomical and, for many words, not very useful. To omit some words entirely and to represent others partially (Bartlett's expedient) is unsatisfactory. To give representative quotations for the most frequent words in the text increases the complexity of the editing for little real advantage. To represent a certain number of words by a frequency count only offers merely a minimum aid to the scholar while still leaving the concordance (unless the list of words treated in this way was very long) uneconomically large. Finally, to provide for some words the numbers of the lines in which they occur, together with a frequency count (which is in effect the arrangement of Montgomery's Dryden concordance) still offers the reader an uninformative list under such headings as A or THE, while not really effecting economies of space. The compromise I adopted combines the last possibilities: the concordances give frequency counts only for twenty-two most common and less significant words, and line numbers and frequency counts for 199 other spellings. In making up the 'count only' list, I assumed that the reader would more readily pick out the frequently-occurring words by visual inspection than by referring from the concordances. The questions of which words to select and on which list they should be put is difficult to settle when one lacks word frequency counts for English of this period. I found that the rank order by magnitude of frequency varied considerably within the first few concordances. I was guided at first by Dewey's table of most-frequently-occurring words, compiled in 1923 from a sample of 100,000 words of modern American English. 3 He found that nine words ( the , of , and , to , a , in , it , that , and I in that order) formed over twenty-five percent of the sample. These words were obvious candidates for the 'count only' list in order to keep the size of the concordances within reasonable bounds. That was transferred to the 'locations' list, and the 'count only' list now consists of a , am , and , are , at , be , by , he , I , in , is , it , of , on , she , the , they , to , was , we , with , you ; in other words, common tenses of the verb 'to be', personal pronouns, articles, conjunctive 'and', and the most frequent prepositions. On Dewey's figures, these words would account for about twenty-eight percent of a sample of modern English. The composition of this list might have been varied from concordance to concordance (which would have presumed knowledge of the most frequently occurring words in the particular text before the concordance program was run) but it seems reasonable, even though the texts are concorded separately, for the reader to have consistent material from concordance to concordance. 4 The list of heading words to be represented by line-numbers and counts (the 'locations' list) has a more complex composition, if only because it includes a large number of variant spellings and many homographs. The 'locations' list comprises 199 items, mainly act and scene headings, exclamations, foreign language articles and pronouns, other infrequent pronominal forms which otherwise would be concorded with homographs (e.g., heel|hee'l , hell|he'll , ill|I'll , well|we'll ), auxiliary verbs, prepositions, negatives, relative pronouns and conjunctions, and a miscellaneous group of &amp; , &amp;c. , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and sir. Naturally, the composition of these lists would have been improved had I known which were the most frequently occurring words before the first text was run. However, the evidence of the concordances will be useful in determining the composition of the lists for any one-volume concordance to Shakespeare or other authors of his period. The pre-editing discussed so far affects the legibility and intelligibility of the context lines, but hardly influences the running of the concordance programs at all. A more complicated part of the preediting is the addition of symbols acting as markers or discriminants. The particular character selected to serve this purpose I call a 'tag' (two together, a 'double-tag'): they do not appear in the printed concordances. Tags are convenient to distinguish words in the text from other words, and they are used to mark words which are to be excepted from the usual routines of the program. Tags are used for several purposes, the effect of the tag depending on its relation to the line or word, and its adjacent characters. Since the tag amounts to an exception marker, we should discuss the features of the text which require exception routines. Speech-prefixes are of little glossorial interest and, since there is small point in listing a large part of the text under the speech-prefixes for the characters in it, or even in giving line-references (since speech-prefixes may more readily be traced directly in the text), I decided to treat them as 'count only' words, with the speech-prefix list varying from play to play. It appeared at first that the obvious test for a speech-prefix was for the program to inspect the beginning of each line for an italics character, and having found one, to check that word against the list of speech-prefixes. However, any list of speech-prefixes contains spellings which are forms of general occurrence (e.g., Off.|off ; An.|an ) and common at the beginning of italicized lines. Furthermore, not all speech-prefixes start with an italics character (e.g., 1. Sol. ) or occur at the beginning of a line of text. To deal with these exceptional cases, tags were inserted during the pre-editing. A single tag before italicized spellings known to be on the speech-prefix list but not speech-prefixes, was used to inhibit comparison with the list of speech-prefixes. A double tag before speech-prefixes which did not satisfy the usual positional test was used to force the program into the speech-prefix routine. (If a spelling is double-tagged but not on the list, it is not treated as a speech-prefix.) Intentional omissions from the lists were forms like All. , Both , and the names of actors such as Sinklo which were felt to have exceptional interest. Too late I discovered that speech-prefixes such as And. for Andrew , for which there were equivalent forms on the 'count only' list, could not be included on the speech-prefix list, for there were inadequate means in the main editing program to allow an extra count to be printed under that heading. These spellings have been left off the speech-prefix lists, and lines containing them have been printed in full under the appropriate heading, contrary to normal practice. The versatility of this device can readily be perceived: for a prose text in which there are no speech-prefixes but there are other sporadic words not on the 'count only' or 'locations' lists (e.g., chapter headings, numbers, or foreign language material), the provision of a full context line can be suppressed by putting these forms on the speech-prefix list, and inserting such double tags as are necessary. The list of speech-prefixes is a special exception list in contrast to the other lists which are general exception lists. The tag has a further important application in connection with compounds. Hyphenated compounds have always presented difficulties in computer-generated concordances. One may give an entry under the whole hyphenated form, or remove the hyphens and list each part of the compound separately, with obvious loss of information. Without an excessively elaborate program, a great deal of pre-editing, and possibly post-editing, one cannot satisfactorily deal with all possible types of hyphenated compound, particularly when the hyphen, by which the program distinguishes the hyphenated compound, also frequently occurs marking the division of a word between lines. In order to avoid separating the components of hyphenated compounds, and to ensure as comprehensive a listing as possible, I used the tag again, inserted before subsequent parts of hyphenated compounds for which a separate entry was desired. This caused the program to treat each tagged component as an additional word. Hence, hyphenated compounds are recorded both under the full form, and again under their parts. When hyphenated compounds have had no tags inserted, they are listed only under the full form. Other compounds also yield to use of the tag. Such forms as o'th'King have tags before the grapheme for which a separate entry is desired, but in these cases, because there is no hyphen, the tag has the effect of terminating the first part of the compound and starting a new reference word after the tag. Hence a line containing o' tag th' tag King would be listed under O, TH, and KING. I chose to keep such elisions as i'th' together, and so inserted tags only before the substantial form to which the elision was attached. In extended passages of prose, there are many words which are divided between lines, with the division indicated by a hyphen in the familiar way. Since it is pointless to concord the two parts of divided words like ob -| scure separately, I have inserted end-of-line bars, as the example shows. To form the heading word in such a case, the program removes the formal characters — |. This point is relevant to hyphenated compounds, for when a tagged hyphenated compound for which entry is desired under all parts occurs divided between two lines, as with Noyse -| tag maker at l.52 of Tmp. , the removal of the characters — | converts this word into the second type of compound discussed above. The presence of the tag causes the word to be split into its components when the concordance messages are formed. Hence this line is listed under NOYSE and MAKER, not NOYSE-MAKER as it would have been had the usual hyphenated compound routine applied. There are various expedients which could have been devised to overcome this inconsistency, but they are so laborious and complex, and the gain so little, that I have decided to leave well enough alone, and have accepted the inconsistency. Had the tag not been inserted, this line would have been listed under NOYSEMAKER. This might have been acceptable in this case, but with other more complicated divided compounds such as cat-a-mountaine or father-in-law , the results would not be pleasant. 5 Another aspect of hyphenated compounds should be noted. When, as with giue-a-me-your , a hyphenated compound contains a particle such as 'a' for which one might hope to provide a full context line under the heading A (by tagging the 'a' to ensure that it is not treated as a 'count only' word), the tag inserted before a in order to decompose the hyphenated compound does not also except it from being treated as a 'count only' word. One tag, one function. Contrarily, neither does the tag supply a full listing for parts of compounds when they are on the exception lists. Giue-a-me-your will therefore be listed under the full form, and its constituents included in the counts for A, ME, and YOUR. References in the concordances will draw the reader's attention to such cases. A further application of the tag as an exception marker ensures that homographs of words on the 'count' and 'locations' lists are given full contextual references. A tag at the beginning of a word inhibits the search of these lists, and ensures that ill , for example, is listed in full, while the homographic I'll is given only line references. The use of the tag for rudimentary homograph distinction is restricted to words on the 'count' and 'locations' lists. Homographs most frequently distinguished in this manner are therefore a (of/he, etc.), an/and (if), I (ay), to (too), art n., bee n., but n., di'd , doe n., ha' , h'as (he has), hast n., (or has't ), heel n., hel/hell n., ill adj., it ( its ), may n., might n., mine n., of (off), off (of), wast n. (or was 't), wer't , wil/will n., and wil't . The tag was also used to suppress the shorter listing of a form on these lists when the word was used in an interesting or ambiguous way, although the provision of a full context line should not be taken as implying that every occurrence of and , for example, listed in full, should be read as an = if. Such excepted occurrences are those that seemed at the time of marking up the texts to warrant closer consideration when the concordance to the particular text was available. At l.940 of TN. , for example, the 'I' in ' Duke . I prethe sing," has been tagged to provide a full listing because the ambiguity here warrants careful study: it has not been excepted because I am sure that the I is equivalent to ay . I know of no concordance program which can properly separate homographs without extensive editing, and the insertion of elaborate grammatical routines. The tag has been thus used to preserve potentially useful material which might otherwise have been concealed in the frequency counts or list of line numbers. In the concordance listings, the first count refers to the occurrences of the form on the 'count' or 'locations' list, and the second count is of the excepted (tagged) occurrences listed in full under the same heading. In most concordances, the entry for A affords an example of this. Where there is a third count, it applies to the spelling used as a speech-prefix. One other printable symbol has been introduced into the texts. Following McKerrow, a standard system of Folio through line numbering has been adopted. For lines in the quarto texts not present in the corresponding Folio texts, a + has been added at the beginning of the line. When this character is encountered by the program, incrementing of the main line counter is suspended and an auxiliary line counter is incremented each time a new line starting with + is processed, until a line is found which does not begin with the + character. At this point the main line count is resumed. Thus, 'Heere comes the Prince and Claudio.' of Q Ado. , which is not found in the Folio text, is listed as line 2588+1. This shows that the Q line is not in F, or contrarily, that the F text lacks a line after line 2588. In order to obtain the Folio through line numbering, each typographical line containing text from the first act or scene heading or stage direction, excluding catchwords, has been counted. Turned-over lines have been treated, according to the compositor's manifest intention, as part of the line to which they belong, even when, as after l.1665 in Err. and after l.2018 in IH6 , the turn-over is found on a line by itself. 6 A final point which the editor had to consider during the preediting arises from the order of the alphabetized old-spelling headings, with which readers unaccustomed to the vagaries of early-modern spelling may not be familiar. The reader will find that words containing i/j and u/v have been sorted in one sequence under I and V respectively. Words starting with numerals are listed at the end of the concordances, after A-Z. But there are other difficulties associated with different kinds of spelling variation in the early texts. However, most of the problems readers are likely to meet in locating particular headings they require can be offset by the references which are incorporated in the concordances, during the running of the editing program. References carry out a number of housekeeping tasks. Where the spelling differs from the modern in the first and/or second letters, a reference has been given from the modern spelling (with which the reader might legitimately begin his search) to the old spelling of the text. When a heading in modern spelling or substantially (that is, initially) in modern spelling is already in the concordance, the reference is a see also reference, directing the reader to additional entries which concern his enquiry. I have not attempted or seen fit to give references from every modern spelling to the old spelling when the reader would naturally begin his search in that area of the concordance; and I have attempted to attach references to headings already in the concordance. Hence, 'AY see I', but 'YIELDE see also yeild'. I have also referred from the names of characters to the speech-prefixes found in the text, e.g., 'KING see also K., Ki. Kin. '; from words on the 'count' or 'locations' list compounded with other forms, e.g., 'AT see also bemockt-at-stabs'; from forms for which the modern and early word division differs, as 'TONIGHT see night', 'HERSELFE see selfe'; from full to elided forms, 'OF see also o''; from numbers to figures, 'FOURE see also 4'; from most homographs even though they are in natural alphabetical order, e.g., 'THAN see also then', 'LOSE see loose', 'OFF see also of', and 'REIN see raigne'; and to forms which are so contracted that the variant spellings might be widely separated or listed with other unrelated forms, as with 'LETTER see also Let.'. Infrequently I have provided a reference from a widely accepted emendation to a form which appears corrupted in the text, as for H5 , 'HONNEUR see also honeus', but in general corruptions have been listed without such comment. Most of the references were written during the pre-editing, but a check on their accuracy was provided by another program which printed the headings from the sorted concordance tape. This list, together with the intermediate printing program, allows the editor to be sure that the references are properly distinguished as see or see also , and to add more references as necessary. A particularly demanding aspect of this work was the interaction between data preparation and program writing. As progress was made with one or the other, various points came up which made it necessary to modify either the data preparation conventions or the program specifications. One such modification was the programmer's discovery that every page in the text was preceded by a page-label which had no function in the preparation of the concordances apart from its use as a positioning aid for the insertion of corrections. By the time the programmer had devised a test for page-labels, and had arranged to skip over them, quarto texts with page-labels of somewhat different format had been typed, and had therefore to be corrected. It is often difficult to see the programming implications of conventions adopted for the data, which more often than not are initially established more for the typist's convenience than for suitability for computation. This tension between data and programming might have been reduced had the program specifications been settled in substance before the texts were typed, but the matter is not so simple. In the first place, this order assumes that all data characteristics with programming implications are known at the beginning, as is often the case in commercial data-processing when the format of the data can be manipulated at the point of generation to facilitate efficient programming and computation. For Shakespeare's texts, which can not be rearranged to suit programming convenience, various attributes of the text emerged only when the pre-editing was well advanced, and even then were sometimes not recognized as having programming implications. When, for example, one has specified that speech-prefixes may be distinguished by their having a terminal italics character and no internal spaces, the discovery of forms like Old Cou. requires either program or data modification. Similarly, when the [has been used for ?, the three [in the text (foul case for the parenthesis?) required substitution. For the Shakespeare concordances, these considerations were not allowed to influence the course of events too greatly, for it was clear from the beginning that the preparation and proofreading of the texts was going to be the main limiting factor. The reader will appreciate the enormity of the task when he reads an account of the processes involved in the preparation of a single text for computation; for thirty-seven texts, this process tends to become laborious. The typing of the texts to paper-tape was entrusted to the manufacturer's data processing bureau in London. In June, 1964, the first test was run on MM. , selected because of its average length and complexity. Suggestions that the error rate would be so minimized as to make proofreading unnecessary if there were double-typing on two differently arranged key-boards proved ill-founded, for the typists made a rather large number of identical misreadings of the unfamiliar material and tended to introduce archaisms in common. Proofreading was seen to be essential, and the rest of the procedures were organized on the basis that the uncorrected text was to be written to magnetic tape from paper-tape as early as possible, in order to use the computer's unrivalled facilities for accurate fast copying and recopying, with elaborate checks to prevent the introduction of errors. During the preliminary stage, the introduction of such computational aids as tags, and certain character substitutions, were decided upon. The machine characteristics of conventional character sets differ amongst computers of different manufacture, and for this work the characters in the texts were represented by a selection from the KDF9 paper-tape code, which had no representation of!, ?, ", ', &amp;, and | (end of line bar). For these were substituted the otherwise unassigned characters £, [, =, ↑, z, and]. Since z does not occur by itself in English, it was used for the ampersand, and as zc , for &amp;c. Other conventions were chosen to avoid obliging the typists to shift from one case to the other unnecessarily. The multiplication sign, and ÷, both in case shift (or lower-case), were typed for the point and hyphen respectively, and →, usually the end message character, was used for the tag. Dashes were represented by three hyphens, thus ÷÷÷. Other characters were represented conventionally, but characters not available on the Friden Flexowriter KDF9 keyboard, such as y t , w c , â, ô, and digraphs (which were expanded) could have no special representation. These were the characters with which the computer worked; for the printed concordances the conventional characters were restored. The order of events in the data preparation stage was as follows. I edited the texts in the manner I have described, and at the same time prepared lists of speech-prefixes and references for each text. The editing required at least three scans through the text, or about thirty hours. The copy for Folio texts was sheets from the Lee facsimile of the Devonshire copy or, when these were not available (unfortunately, my unbound copy was imperfect), Xerox prints from University Microfilms' reproduction of the Grenville copy in the British Museum. For the quartos I used the Clarendon Press facsimiles edited by Sir Walter Greg and Professor Hinman, otherwise University Microfilms' facsimiles. The particular copy used is noted in the introduction to each concordance so the reader can consult the originals. Since I have followed the readings of the particular copy from which I worked, a note of the press-variants (which are not specially treated in the concordances) recorded by Hinman has been given in the introductions to the several concordances. After the facsimile copy was marked-up, the texts were then punched to paper-tape in London. The paper-tape was printed out, and was proofread twice by an independent team of proofreaders, who marked the necessary corrections on the printed copy, and returned it to me for a further check, a re-reading not amounting to a proofreading. This served mainly to check the original editing and the proofreaders' accuracy. In the worst case, only three substantive unmarked errors were found, a figure so low as to suggest that further proofing would not have significantly improved accuracy. Although one's primary concern is to keep the error rate as low as humanly possibly, there is an error rate in work of this nature which cannot be avoided. I would be grateful if readers would communicate to me any errors they come across. After this check reading, the printed copy with the marked errors was returned to London for the preparation of correction messages, and the uncorrected paper-tape text was written to magnetic tape by the text establishment program. The text correction stage uses the facilities of a manufacturer's standard library program, called POST, originally designed to write and correct computer programs on magnetic tape, with complete lines as the unit of entry and correction. This program was modified to permit operations on words inside lines, in order to keep the extent of the corrections as small as possible and to reduce the possibility of introducing errors into text already passed as correct. Because the text was copied from magnetic tape to magnetic tape with automatic checks by the POST program, and could be output to paper-tape or in readable form to the line-printer at any time by another library program (UPDATER) for off-line checking, the possibility of machine corruption of the text was negligible. Occasionally, there were misadventures, but these arose more often than not from human fallibility or misunderstanding of the systems, and were readily detected and corrected. Preparation of the correction messages for the POST correction program required writing, typing, and proof-reading of messages relating to consecutive lines and words of text, which replaced incorrect lines or words by the proper sequences of characters. This system made it impossible to make false corrections: if the sequence of characters in the text on magnetic tape did not correspond to that on the correction tape, the correction run failed, and a failure message identifying the reason for failure, and the particular faulty correction, was out-put for the editor's information. When this happened, the correction paper-tape had to be corrected, and the correction sequence re-run until all the corrections succeeded. This would be a laborious operation if it were carried out on a single text, but it is reasonably efficient when a large number of texts is corrected in a single correction run. The maximum number of texts which may be corrected at one time depends only on the number which can be held on magnetic tape. For a large project such as this where accuracy is essential this system is tolerable, but the time needed to get one text corrected makes it infuriatingly slow for anyone intending to concord just one text. A flexible on-line system using a visual display screen would make this process much more efficient. Once all the corrections have been successfully inserted, the corrected text is printed out, and thoroughly proofread by the editor for the last time. This reassures him that the text faithfully represents the original and his intentions, and also enables him to check that it is properly organized for the running of the concordance programs, that is, that all the extra markers necessary to identify homographs, speech-prefixes, extra lines and so forth have been inserted consistently. After any necessary final corrections, and the running of another program to check whether all lines of text are present and that the numeration corresponds to various manual counts, the text becomes available for the main concordance program. As far as the editor is concerned, the main burden has been lifted from his shoulders. The concordance program is run in three parts. The first performs what is generally understood as 'concording'; that is, it reads the lines of the text, extracts words from them, forms the keywords for sorting, and writes messages containing the key-word, reference line, and line number appropriately for the different kinds of out-put ('count only', 'location only', speech-prefix, or full) for every word in the text on to an out-put magnetic tape. The messages on this tape are naturally in text order, and so are sorted into alphabetical order by another program which produces a sorted magnetic tape as in-put for the editing program. The editing program produces two styles of out-put at the discretion of the editor who has the opportunity of sending the edited concordance to the line-printer, or to another magnetic tape for further editing for film-setting. This editing program takes the sorted messages and organizes them under the heading words, incorporating the references from paper-tape at the same time, to produce pages very much like those of the final concordance. The edited concordance on magnetic tape was organized for printing on an Xeronic printer (after conversion to IBM magnetic tape format) which at the time of writing the out-put specifications was the only available device with the necessary range of upper- and lower-case characters, and sufficiently fast to make the work economical. However, when at the last moment it became possible to contemplate film-setting, I wrote another program to convert the Xeronic out-put for film-setting. This tape was edited by Computaprint Ltd., London, who delivered a film to the Press for conventional printing, in the normal upper- and lower-case characters. To the film-set concordance it was necessary only to add a short handset introduction listing the line-numbers, corrected misprints, and other useful information, for the printer to print and bind, with no proofreading or press correction. The final product in the first instance is thus thirty-seven concordances to the plays of Shakespeare, prepared from the best early texts. The greatest limitation of the present programs is that they were designed to handle only one text at a time. I have been working on programs to concord any number of texts into one concordance, and I hope that these programs will be applied in due course to concordances of the First Folio, and Shakespeare's poems. It is tempting at this point to consider the task done, but concordances, despite their obvious and essential utility, afford only the simplest ordering of the linguistic evidence of their texts, and, save for the most important authors, this hardly justifies the effort necessary to produce them. For my own work the value of the concordances is small, and parallel with this work I have been developing programs which analyze the orthographical characteristics of the separate pages of each text. These programs throw into relief attributes of the text which remain in relative obscurity in the concordances. (See for example the distribution of capitalized and non-capitalized CHAINE in Err. ). Because these programs are more discriminating than any concordance program could be expected to be, they offer easy means for the study of stage-directions, speech-prefixes, italicization, justification, capitalization, hyphenation, elision, rhymes, and the treatment of proper nouns, as well as variant spellings, on different pages of text. The unit may also be the individual column, scene, play, or indeed any other unit of text desired. They also provide for the combination of sections of the texts by different compositors, by date of composition, from different types of copy or in any other combination, and lead ultimately towards the application of multivariate analysis techniques which should remove many questions (particularly in regard to distribution of punctuation) from the realms of speculation. I do not expect that this will be completed overnight, but when it is done, I hope it will be shown to have justified the time and money spent in preparing Shakespeare's works for computation. From devoted study of the concordances by a host of expert and minute textual scholars, and from the further factual base which will be afforded by additional computational analysis, we can hope to make large strides towards the ultimate edition to which we all look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 In this context it is homonyms which present the greatest problems. An intermediate run on the computer might readily compile a glossary or word-list from which homographs such art = n. could be distinguished before another concording stage, but this process is not economical. 2 The flexibility of these programs in dealing with texts which they were not designed to treat has already been tested on concordances of Middle English manuscripts, and I am preparing to concord an edition of Bullokar (which has particularly complicated orthographical characteristics) and some Victorian prose. 3 G. Dewey, Relative frequency of English speech sounds (1923), p. 17f. 4 Should anyone be interested in having a full listing of occurrences of words on the 'count' or 'location' lists, it would be possible to obtain them only by processing the texts again. Economy could be achieved by treating the principal words of the text as words to be given short listing, leaving only the previously rejected words to be concorded in full. 5 The more complex program to which I refer in the last paragraph circumvents this difficulty. 6 This method of line numbering has been adopted by the Modern Language Association's Variorum Committee, and will be used in Professor Hinman's forthcoming First Folio facsimile and by Dr. Walker in the Oxford Old-Spelling Shakespeare. I am grateful for their co-operation in establishing this system and in the application of it to the texts.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Printers and the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647, Sections 4 and 8D-F by Standish Henning</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This article is one in a series devoted to describing the printing of the Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647. Robert K. Turner, Jr., who initiated the project, laid the groundwork for the study in his description of section 2 of the folio published in Studies in Bibliography , XX (1967). There he wrote generally about the efforts of Humphrey Moseley to publish thirty-three plays and one masque previously unprinted belonging to the "Beaumont and Fletcher" canon, and specifically about the kinds of evidence used in his analysis. Section 4 ($A-I 4 ) and part of section 8 ($8D-F 4 ), printed in the shop of Ruth Raworth, contain four plays: The Maid in the Mill , The Prophetess , and Bonduca in section 4, and Four Plays, or Moral Representations, in One , in section 8. The model for any such study as this is Charlton Hinman's monument to invention and perseverance, The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963), to which both Turner and I refer for more elaborate descriptions of certain techniques used by us. Owing to some technical differences in the printing of the two folios, however, Professor Turner devised modifications in the display of evidence, chiefly in the graphs (Hinman's term) showing the sequence followed by the compositors in the distribution and setting of each quire. Rather than repeat his detailed explanation of the collection and analysis of evidence, I have thought it best in this digest to refer the reader to his article, though I include here a "reading" of Quire G as a vade mecum for that part of the folio printed by Mrs. Raworth, as well as some remarks on the special features to be found therein. Like Professor Turner, I have deposited a typescript of the entire study with University Microfilms, Inc., Ann Arbor, Michigan, whence it may be obtained for closer examination. We will follow this method of double publication for the remaining sections. 1 Almost nothing is known about Ruth Raworth. Her husband John became free of the Company of Stationers on 6 February 1632 by patrimony; his father may have been that Robert Raworth who, with his partner John Monger, got into trouble for printing Venus and Adonis ( SR , III, 703, 704). John printed, according to Morrison's Indexes to the STC and Wing, 84 items between 1638 and his death in July, 1645. His wife carried on the press in her name until 1648 when she married her husband's apprentice, Thomas Newcombe; in the interval of her widowhood her shop printed about twenty books, not counting her work on the Beaumont and Fletcher folio. This is obviously not a very big output; there is no reason, external or internal, to suppose that she had inherited more than one press from her husband. To look at the size of the Raworth shop from a different angle, only one boy, John Cottrell, had been apprenticed to John Raworth before 1640. 2 Her biggest job in 1647 seems to have been the printing of Enrico Davila's The History of the Civil Wars in France (Wing D 413), a fat folio printed lavishly in large type with considerable white space. That folio plus a quarto (Fanshawe's translation of Il Pastor Fido ), an octavo on the Creed, and a broadsheet comprise, with her share of the Beaumont and Fletcher folio, her known production for 1647. I mention these facts because of the bearing they might have on any discussion devoted to whether there was a lapse of time between the setting of the plays in section 4, or between the completion of section 4 and the setting of her part of section 8. I may as well state at once that, so far as I can tell, there were no appreciable delays; if there were, analysis of the other known 1647 books will not help since they are not printed in the type used for the Beaumont and Fletcher folio. The most singular anomaly, if only because it is so easily observed, in the printing of the folio is the use of lower-case letters at the beginning of verse lines in three of the Raworth plays, The Prophetess , Bonduca , and Four Plays in One . The first play in section 4, The Maid in the Mill , is treated conventionally. W. W. Greg judged in 1922 that the non-capitalization "betray[ed] the individuality" of a new printer called upon by Moseley to help speed section 4 to its completion, 3 but R. C. Bald recognized from the recurrence of the skeleton rules that one printer was responsible for all four plays. 4 And we may add that one of the compositors who capitalized in The Maid in the Mill did not capitalize in the succeeding plays. The answer must lie elsewhere. The Prophetess begins on D1. Quire D exhibits a number of odd characteristics, including the use of one skeleton for three of the four formes, but it is like the preceding quires in that type used to set the earliest pages appears in the last pages, which means that each compositor — they were setting by formes — had only about three pages in type at any given moment up to the end of Quire D. But in Quire E, and thereafter in all but two columns each in Quires H, 8E and 8F, setting stayed one full quire ahead of distribution, so that instead of there being about five pages in type at one time, eight pages became the rule. In Turner's analysis of section 2, I have found no instance of distribution being that far behind composition. It seems proper to infer, then, that a decision to cease capitalizing verse lines was made to keep composition going as fast as possible instead of having to stop to replenish the supply of capitals, of which there were proportionately fewer than of the lower-case letters. That the supply of capitals was relatively low is difficult to prove, but two items of evidence point to it: the number of italic M 's seems to have been as low as 25 at one time, and never higher than about 45; and the odd fact that in the instances of types appearing in the work of a compositor who apparently did not "own" them, the anomalous types tend to be capitals, leading to the possibility that the capitals were, if not held in common, at least frequently borrowed. It has long been supposed that Ruth Raworth was slow in printing the plays assigned to her (Bald, pp. 35-36; Gerritsen, p. 254). Bald speaks of the "break in the printing between The Maid in the Mill and The Prophetess "; he refers to the non-capitalization, of course, but implies that there was a long delay associated with that change in procedure. Actually there is less evidence of delay between Quires C and D than there is in the printing of Quire D itself, where the triple use of one skeleton and the migration of a running-title from one skeleton to another mark obvious delays. The decision not to capitalize, a radical departure from convention, most likely came about as the result of some pressure to speed work up. But we would expect to find two kinds of evidence if the delay had been very long. Had the skeletons been disassembled to get at the furniture and the rules, for example, the chances of their being reassembled for Quire D in precisely the same order that they were in in Quires A-C would be very small indeed. And we could not expect the type in Quire D to reflect the orderly distribution of Quire C if printing had ceased for a long enough time to necessitate the distribution of all of the quire. 5 Thus, although the wary bibliographer remembers that nihil alienum est was apparently the printers' motto, there is not sufficient bibliographical evidence to point to an extended break in the printing between The Maid in the Mill and The Prophetess , nor, by an extension of these same arguments, between Bonduca and Four Plays in One . Returning to the fact that distribution was frequently a full quire behind composition, I want to point out a major implication involved in this distance or spread, namely that it often makes judgments about the order of the formes through the press very tentative. When they are present, progressive deformations of the skeleton-rules tell with some certainty which of two formes imposed in the same skeleton was printed first, for example that 2 v :3 preceded 1 v :4, and 2:3 v preceded 1:4 v . But the deformities say nothing about whether Skeleton I or Skeleton II of a given quire was the forme first printed. The analyst starts with two assumptions as he approaches a quire. The first is that the skeletons will alternate, since imposition of alternate skeletons around type-pages is the most economical method of printing. The briefest experience, however, warns him that this first expectation is not one to count on. The second is that there will be an orderly relationship between distribution and setting, that the two will be reasonably close together in time, and specifically that type from the forme first printed will appear later in the same quire, giving him pretty certain information about the first- and last-set pages. Thus if deformations in the rules show that X2 v :3 was printed before X1 v :4, and if types are common to X2 v and X1 v or X1, he will properly assume that X2 v was the first-set page of the quire. Other considerations might make him modify or even scrap the assumption, but he would start there. Now if, on the other hand, he finds no type common to any page of Quire X, he loses that initial confirmation of predictability. If, further, he discovers that all eight pages of the preceding Quire W were still in type just before the setting of Quire X began, he must reckon with the possibility that the compositors had a rich reserve of six — perhaps all eight — type-pages available to choose from when it became necessary to distribute in order to set Quire X, i.e. W1:4 v in the press, W2 v :3, W2:3 v and W1 v :4 all wrought off and waiting undistributed when the compositors turned to set X2 v :3. Under such conditions it is impossible to tell much about the relationship between composition and presswork: the press could be hot on the compositors' heels, or a quire behind them. In section 2, Professor Turner found no full quires which did not have types in common between two or more pages; and in his eighteen quires he shows only two occasions when, by the consecutive use of the same skeleton, there was a delay in printing. In sections 4 and 8 I have been forced to postulate such delays nine times in the printing of eleven quires (see Appendix A, Table I, Skeleton Formes and Center Rules), beside three or four shorter delays involving center or horizontal rules. I doubt very much whether all those delays in fact took place, but I have no way of proving the matter one way or the other. A particularly aggravated and aggravating instance of delay is Quire H, where Skeleton II imposes three of the formes, the last two, according to the deformation of the rules, being 1:4 v and 1 v :4 (itself a problematic reversal of the expected order). Not only was there a delay between these two formes, there was also one between H1 v :4 and I2 v :3 which although it was imposed by Skeleton I, contains type from H4, i.e. H1:4 v had to be printed and distributed before I2 v :3 could be set. Actually this latter kind of delay is the more rational one since it might easily mark a moment when the end of a day coincided with the completion of a perfected sheet. It is easy enough to see from the number of delays, even if several are more apparent than real owing to the distance between distribution and composition, that printing proceeded much more slowly than was theoretically necessary. How much time was in fact lost is not easy to calculate, however. The compositors' job included imposing formes; whether they alternated skeletons efficiently or sometimes used one skeleton for consecutive formes, their time spent on imposition would remain the same. The pressmen who had to make register and otherwise look to the often tedious business of make-ready were the ones who might chafe the most at having to wait. Cumulatively the time lost must have added up to a considerable amount, leading always to the possibility noted earlier that Mrs. Raworth fell far behind in the printing of the plays assigned to her. And yet it is difficult to equate the no doubt desultory technique of her shop with any crucial delay involving, as Gerritsen argues, the reassignment of three of her six plays to another printer. Graphs and Supporting lists . Though it seems most economical to refer the reader to Robert Turner's analysis of section 2 for a full explanation of the kinds of data used by us both, I here give a reading of the graph for Quire G. The kinds of evidence used in our study divide into three categories, presswork, composition and distribution, and the identity of compositors. Under the first are gathered (I use Turner's words): 1. Evidence from the components of the skeleton forme, such as running-titles and rules, and from center rules, taking into account the testimony of priority given by disfigurations, dislocations, and other peculiarities; 2. Evidence from type matter reappearing within the quire; 3. Evidence from embossing. Under the second come: 1. Evidence from reappearing types; 2. Evidence from reappearing rules, display types, heads, and other typographical matter not a part of the skeleton forme; 3. Evidence from type shortages. The identity of the compositors, established on the basis of their spelling preferences, serves chiefly to corroborate and refine assignment of their stints. One always starts with the evidence relating to the presswork before constructing the graph. Skeleton I, which had imposed the last-printed forme of Quire F, imposes G2:3 v and G1 v 4; Skeleton II imposes G2 v :3 and G1:4 v . There are no deformities in the rules of either skeleton to help establish the order in which the formes were printed. (If, for example, Rule 10 had a bend in it in F4 v and G3 v , but not in G1 v , the assumption would be that G3 v had been printed before G1 v .) Horizontal Rule T is common to G1a and G4b in Skeletons I and II. There is no type common to any two pages of the quire. Now the difficulty here is that the use of the skeletons works against the grain of economical alternation. Ideally Skeleton II would impose both inner formes (2 v :3, 1 v :4) and Skeleton I would impose the outer formes. As it stands in Quire G, there will either have to be a delay between the printing of G2:3 v while Skeleton I is transferred to the waiting forme, or else the graph will have to demonstrate that G1:4 v was set before G1 v :4, or — and this is a possibility which comes as a result of the fact mentioned earlier, that composition was a full quire ahead of distribution — there were two formes (G1 v :4, G1:4 v ) waiting when G2 v :3 (Skeleton II) was wrought off, and that skeleton was arbitrarily imposed around G1:4 v . Unless there is evidence to the contrary, it is best to assume that printing occurred in the same order as composition. The contrary evidence here is the delay caused by the transference of skeletons, but such delays occur with considerable regularity in sections 4 and 8, so that I have somewhat cautiously shown the probable order of printing as: Skeleton: II I I II Forme: 2 v :3 2:3 v 1 v :4 1:4 v Note that Rule T, common to G1a and G4b, also represents a delay. Turning to the graph, we find in the vertical column the pages undistributed when the setting of Quire G began. Line 1 shows that E1a, still undistributed after the composition of Quire F, was distributed into Compositor A's case. Five pieces of type from E1a appeared in G2 v a and another in G2 v b. Line 2 shows that E1b was distributed after the setting of G2 v a was completed and before or during the setting of G2 v b. Then Compositor A apparently distributed two full pages, F3-F3 v (lines 3-6) before setting G2, and so on until he completed his stint at the end of G1b. F4b was the last column distributed because type from it appears nowhere in Compositor A's work save in G1. The single type (line 6) from F3 v b may seem too frail to support any evidential weight at all; but F3 v has only 24 lines of text in each column, and since F3 v a produced four types found in G2a, it seems best to assume that both columns were distributed at the same time. Compositor B set his four pages in seriatim order to match the work of Compositor A who set in reverse seriatim order; they thus produced formes by their synchronized labors. "The order in which the columns of Quire G are listed at the head of the graph is the order of composition from each case as indicated by the order of printing and the order of distribution. It is to the second of these matters that the numerals entered in each line to the right of the distributed-column designation have relevance. A '1' indicates that the particular column was a part of the first forme of its quire to be machined, a '2' that it was part of the second forme, and so on" (Turner, pp. 49-50). Lines 19-27 represent Turner's category of latent type. These are types which come from formes distributed for the setting of pages of the preceding quire (here, Quire F), but which appear in Quire G either because they were not needed, or because they filtered down deeply into the sort, or because they were in fact used in Quire F but were unobserved there. Their value as evidence comes in the degree to which they remain in their "owners'" cases. A large quantity of latent type from Case A (that is, the case used by Compositor A) appearing in the work of Compositor B will indicate that something worthy of analysis has taken place. Almost always, however, latent type corroborates "ownership" as it does in this graph except for line 21, where E2a types, last noted in the possession of Compositor A, appear in Compositor B's work. The incidence is not high — two pieces — but a check of the Quire F graph shows a single E2a type in Compositor B's F2 v b. Now both this piece and the one in G4a are capitals, and as I remarked earlier, it seems likely that capitals were often borrowed, or perhaps held in common. Still one wants to pursue the possibility that Compositor A might have set a small portion of F4a. There is no doubt that the bulk of the type in G3-4 v came from Case B; furthermore, lines 22-27 show latent Case B type in the same pages. What evidence does the tabulation of spelling preferences, the last segment of the graph, provide? The preferences of both compositors cluster comfortingly in the pages assigned to them by the type evidence, except for Compositor A's "devil" in G4a, and since devil-divel are strongly marked preferences of the two compositors, the investigator has further ambiguous evidence to deal with. Turning to tables not included in this digest, he learns that the anomalous G4a types are found in lines 50 and 52, suspiciously close together. Other G4a types (lines 13 and 14 of the graph) appear between lines 7 and 38 of column a, not mingled with the anomalous types. "Devil," however, is in line 26, not near the anomalous types, and since Compositor B has elsewhere shown himself susceptible to copy-spellings, we may properly decide here that none of G4a was set by Compositor A. After the first fine blush of optimism in the early 1950's regarding the certainty with which compositors could be identified and so be assigned to definite sections of a text, experience modified the expectation of reliability which might be attached to compositor determination. Now, however, taken in conjunction with evidence provided by the patterned repetition of type, the evidence of spelling tests has gained a new security and function as a corroborator of the patterns, and even as a method for refining inferences drawn from the type evidence. As we might expect from a shop so apparently small as Mrs. Raworth's, few compositors worked on the folio. It is relatively easy to distinguish two, Compositors A and B, who set the bulk of the plays; it is much less easy, and finally perhaps wrong, to identify a third, Compositor C, who set part of The Maid in the Mill only. 6 The spelling preferences may be set out in tabular form, followed by an explanation. Compositor A Compositor B Compositor C Romane (tolerates Roman) Roman devil divel devil Emperour Emperor (tolerates Emperour) -inde (tolerates -ind) -ind (tolerates -inde) 2 noun 2. noun (tolerates 2 noun) 2 noun long pronoun odd S.D. (tolerates long pro.) Of the three, Compositor A's preferences are the most stable. After he began work, in Quire D, he tolerated Compositor B's preferences many fewer times than Compositor B tolerated his. By "tolerate" I mean the use of the other's preference at least twice in the course of the man's whole share of the folio; Compositor A for example prefers - inde (as in winde , finde , binde ), but tolerates - ind a total of eight times in five of the nine half-quires he set. "2 noun" means that in speech-prefixes such as "1 Lord" or "2 Soldier" he does not use a period after the numeral; "2. noun", Compositor B's preference, indicates the use of the period. This preference seems to be significant only in speech-prefixes and not significant in such uses as the designation of songs (" 3 Song ") or stage directions in C1 v and C2. Compositor B's preferences are less stable, though they are quite clearly marked. Because he tolerates most of Compositor A's spellings, the impression grows that he was more easily influenced by the spelling of his copy than was Compositor A. Here is where the category of "odd S.D." makes itself felt. The term refers to the use of roman proper names in italic stage-directions, e.g. " Enter Julio and Franio" (B1b), whereas the more frequent form puts all words in italic type. It is hard to decide whether Compositor B's use of this convention reflects a preference or the appearance of his copy. The occurrences of it cluster in The Maid in the Mill (Quires A-C), diminish in Quires D and E, and then die out altogether except for one instance in 8E4. They usually appear on the same page with other all-italic directions. But most significantly, the odd S.D.'s are always associated with those parts of The Maid in the Mill written by Rowley, frequently associated with the Massinger parts of The Prophetess , though mixed with Fletcher's parts (three Fletcher to five Massinger), appear once in 8E4 in a Fletcher part of Four Plays in One , 7 but never in the play wholly by Fletcher, Bonduca . What I suspect happened is that The Maid in the Mill was a composite manuscript written in the hands of Fletcher and Rowley, that Rowley used the roman-name variation and was followed in it by Compositor B who let it affect his practice sporadically thereafter for two quires. This is the more likely if, as I believe, Compositor C set the odd S.D. in C1 v , for that would mean that two compositors adopted the same convention. Unhappily, the existence of Compositor C is not certain. He resembles Compositor A so thoroughly that I did not distinguish between them until quite late in the study when a refinement of the earliest spelling tests showed Compositor B's willingness to use long forms of pronouns ( yee , shee , hee , wee ). Compositor A never used the long pronoun form in those parts of the quires already confidently assigned to him on the basis of type ownership, that is from Quire D onward, while in Quire B a mild toleration for - ee appeared in conjunction with two of his preferences, devil and 2 noun . Since the type used to set Mrs. Raworth's plays did not begin to be divided into two cases until the distribution of Quire B (and was not completed until the distribution of Quire D), it was not clear to me how many compositors had set Quires A-C. I had been put off by the great rarity of - inde words (only four in those three quires) which later on became strong identifiers of Compositor A. Eventually it seemed best to suppose that a third man had helped to set The Maid in the Mill , a compositor who very much resembled Compositor A except for the absence of the - inde identifier. Type substitutions occur whenever there is an especially heavy run on a sort, as often happens as the result of repeated speech-prefixes in plays where the italic capitals cannot meet the pressure put on them. As the compositor nears the end of his supply of a letter, but usually before the sort is exhausted, he begins to substitute roman for italic letters so that Caratach (to take an example from Bonduca in Quire G) becomes Caratach , the speech-prefix Car . becomes Car ., and so on. A rather simple computation often allows the analyst to show that the substitution coincides with the pattern of distribution and composition already established, or, in cases of doubt, to bolster one possible solution against another. For example, in Quire G Compositor A set 52 P 's in G2 v -1 v before he began substituting P's on G1, the last page of his stint. Since Quire F used no P 's and hence could not act as a source of replenishment as formes from it were distributed, the calculation is easy. More complicated is what happened in Compositor B's stint. He substituted 11 I 's in G4 v b after setting 65 J 's in G3-4 v a and part of G4 v b ( Iudas for Judas ), which again corroborates the order of setting shown in the graph. But he substituted D's and C's in G4 and then got a supply of italic letters for G4 v from some source other than the distribution of F1 v which used none. This may be shown in the following table, where the bracketed pages are those which were distributed before the setting of the Quire G pages, and the bracketed numbers indicate the C 's released for use in those pages — in this example, none. The number of C 's in use when substitution began is very small, 23 at most; indeed the total used in G3-4 v is only 35, which hardly compares with the 52 P 's or 65 J 's noted above, but I do not know how to account for the inequities. They come up with sufficient frequency to remind us that we are not dealing in an exact science. Finally, the graph may be summarized thus: The charts set out certain information in tabular form. Table I shows in the vertical columns the order of printing elaborated to include the relationships among the rules and running-titles, which are given arbitrary arabic and roman numerals respectively. Other tables not included here describe each rule and running-title fully. The Summary of Printing shows which compositor set each page, or column when the page was divided, of the plays set in Mrs. Raworth's shop. In the Summary, a (b) indicates a blank page.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">William Strahan's Ledgers, II: Charges for Papers, 1738-1785 by Patricia Hernlund</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We know very little about the making and use of paper in England in the eighteenth century. Even though more information is becoming available in published documents and commentary, we do not know enough to make generalizations about paper which would apply to the entire century or to large sections of England. Until we have more specific details, we must proceed with the kind of caution described by Donald F. McKenzie in his recent and valuable study The Cambridge University Press 1696-1712 (1966). Speaking of the difference between production cost and wholesale and retail costs of books, McKenzie warns Lack of more detailed knowledge on all these points makes it difficult to draw any very reliable general conclusions from the information supplied by the Cambridge papers. So long as the limitations of their evidence are recognized, it is of considerable value in taking us slightly closer to an understanding of the economics of publishing. But we need to know a great deal more about paper costs in particular cases and about the proportion of any edition sold to the trade before we can refine the evidence at all significantly. [I, 145] Even the few generalizations and facts we do have will bear reexamination. For example, it is widely accepted as true that the customer, particularly if he were a bookseller, provided the paper for a printing contract. Frequently the proof for this theory is a reference to the "fact" that the customer provided the paper at William Strahan's large and prosperous printing company in London — a "fact" for which there is no evidence at all. Even so careful a scholar as McKenzie refers to Strahan's ledgers to substantiate, in part, his contention that book-sellers who printed at Cambridge at the beginning of the century "almost invariably . . . supplied their own paper" (I, 162). The source for this theory about Strahan, cited by McKenzie, is a single sentence in Richard Austen-Leigh's "William Strahan and His Ledgers," Library , 4 Ser., III (1923), 284. Austen-Leigh says, in a vague and casual way, "when printing for booksellers, Strahan does not seem to have supplied the paper as a rule : apparently the present habit, not much approved by printers, whereby the publisher supplies the printer with paper is of old standing" (italics mine). J. A. Cochrane makes a slightly different claim in his recent biography Dr. Johnson's Printer: The Life of William Strahan (1964). Cochrane devotes p. 16 to describing the use of paper at Strahan's company. He begins by saying that "paper was usually supplied to the printer by the bookseller (or publisher), but the printer would have to buy it for jobbing work." Cochrane's supporting evidence is not a discussion of Strahan's ledgers but a description of Richardson's practices as presented by William M. Sale, Jr., in Samuel Richardson: Master Printer (1950), pp. 24-25, which is followed by the explanation that "all paper was of course hand made in sheets measuring about 15 inches by 20 — the standard crown size — or 12 inches by 16." Cochrane concludes p. 16 by implying that Stephen Theodore Janssen was Strahan's sole supplier of "small amounts [of paper] used for jobbing work and such bookwork as was not worth the bookseller's while supplying paper for." None of Cochrane's statements is totally wrong but none of them explains any more accurately than Austen-Leigh's sentence what actually happened at Strahan's shop. Strahan's ledgers do contain valuable information about practices followed in using and charging for paper stock. We must remember, however, that the information is fragmentary rather than complete because Strahan's warehouse books for major paper transactions have not been found. 1 I have gathered 631 entries mentioning paper, a representative majority of such entries in Ledgers A, B, D and F, from 1738 to the year of Strahan's death, 1785. For the sake of clarity, I shall mention these 631 entries throughout as though they were exactly half of the entries for paper rather than a majority. This decision allows me to compute approximate percentages so that the reader will have a clear understanding as the argument proceeds: 631 x 2 = 1,262 approximate total entries mentioning paper = 7% Ledgers A, B, D and F =16,867 approximate total entries note mentioning paper = 93% ------ ------ 18,129 2 100% The standard debit entry in Strahan's ledgers represented a contract between Strahan and the customer, the proprietor of the copyright. It is significant that Strahan did not mention paper stock in 16,867 entries, for it means the customer was not billed for this costly necessity. If he was not being billed, then (a) the customer was providing the paper, or (b) Strahan was including paper in the cost per sheet of the contract. At first glance, it seems logical to say that the customer was providing the paper, and this hypothesis is confirmed by examination of the entries in which paper is mentioned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ledger Entries Mentioning Paper Since Strahan mentioned paper in only 7% of the ledger entries, the 631 entries discussed below represent an extremely small percentage of Strahan's business. But the very existence of these entries constitutes the first evidence leading to the conclusion that the customer provided his own paper. The entries fall into four categories, each of which internally supports the conclusion. Taken cumulatively, the five kinds of evidence are conclusive: it was standard practice for the customer to provide his own paper. 1) "Special Entries" for Paper The first category of twenty-seven entries consists of ten credit entries and seventeen debit entries of a "special" nature: they show the method Strahan used on those occasions when he was asked to keep a detailed record of large amounts of paper. All of the entries occur between 1753 and 1767 and are long and detailed. In the ten credit entries, Strahan listed paper spoiled or not used for large contracts or for large partnerships involving several joint customers. For example, Strahan "abated" Andrew Millar's account on five occasions by crediting the well-known bookseller with amounts of paper spoiled or left over from large jobs. One of these credit listings reads: [Mr. Andrew Millar] Contra Cr. [Credit to the Account] Oct 1762 R Qr [Reams and Quires] £ s d by Robertson Paper 8 vo 1: 19: at 14s 1. 7.6 Hume 4 to 1: 17½ at 13s 1. 4.6 Hume's Casars [ sic ] spoilt 15 0. 9.9 Fielding's Royal 1: 1. 4.0 Chambaud's Paper 15 0.10.6 [Ledger A 12or] The five works in this example were printed before the entry date of October, 1762; but in no other place, either in the standard debit entries for the printing of the works or in the entries for extra charges, had the paper been mentioned before Strahan credited it to Millar's account. It is therefore plain that Millar provided the paper and asked that Strahan credit the remainder to his account after a series of large jobs. Similar to the credit entries, in that they are rare, long, and detailed, are the seventeen debit entries which list paper used, spoiled or not used for large contracts (thirteen are for works published in partnerships). The entries show contracts in which the customer specified a certain paper dealer (in eleven instances) and asked for a record of his shipment. Strahan simply listed the paper received; the cost to the customer was obviously a matter between the customer and his paper supplier. 3 For example, in 1754 Strahan printed part of Benjamin Martin's Lingua Britannica Reformata; or a new English Dictionary . The entry reads, in part, Partners in Martin's Dictionary 1754 £ s d March Printing 34 ½ Sheets of Do. No. 4000 &amp;c.mmat;4.9.0 p. Sheet 153.10.6 ....................... 34 ½ Sheets takes up 276 Reams had at different times of Mr. Stiles [no charge] [Ledger B 7r] The debit and credit entries in this category indicate contracts in which the customer supplied the paper. Taken alone, they do not prove that this was standard practice, but there are three other kinds of entries for paper to add to this evidence. 2) Entries Mentioning Size or Quality of Paper The second category consists of forty-five entries in which Strahan designated the size or quality of paper used in a job, but did not list any charge for the paper in his billing. Again, it seems obvious that the customer supplied the paper and that Strahan had some special reason for going to the trouble of listing the kind of paper used. Eighteen of the entries show one of the special reasons: a split run of paper. The customer split his run between a majority of books on ordinary paper, usually common Demy, and a small number of books on large paper, usually common Royal, to be given to subscribers or influential people. Though common Royal would cost the customer more than Demy because of its size , it had the advantage of giving the impression of quality by allowing a large margin, and it did not cost as much as a finer quality of larger paper would have cost him. 4 A typical entry reads Guthrie's Grammar 4 to 1779 Novr. Printing Do. 101 Sheets, No. 750 Demy &amp; 250 Royal &amp;c.mmat; £1:6:0 per Sheet [£]131.6.0 [Ledger F 25r] The first two categories, then, are composed of seventy-two entries in which the customer supplied paper for the job. The third and fourth categories which follow offer a different kind of evidence, for their 559 entries indicate contracts in which Strahan provided the paper. 3) Printing Entries "with Paper" Category three consists of eighty-eight entries distinguished by use of the term "with paper" at the end of the standard debit entry for printing. They establish that Strahan did have a method for indicating contracts which included paper he supplied. The existence of the method throughout the ledgers indicates that these are the only times when he supplied paper as part of the contract. In almost all cases, the entries "with paper" are for "job work" rather than for the "book work" which really sustained Strahan's business; that is, the contracts usually involved fewer than 2½ sheets, usually cost (including paper) less than £3½, and usually had runs of 500 or 1000, which I have established in my earlier article as being "average" runs. A typical entry is: Thomas Gilbert Esqr. 1782 June Observations on the Poor Bill, one Sheet, No. 350 with Paper [£] 3.3.0 [Ledger F 29v] It is a fairly simple matter to reconstruct the circumstances which led to these entries. A customer with a small job (usually not a book-seller) asked that paper be included in his contract, since it would be a great deal of expense and trouble for a "layman" to buy one ream or only a few reams; whereas Strahan could provide the paper from stock on hand which had been bought at wholesale prices and was therefore cheaper to the customer, even at Strahan's profit markup, than the customer's purchase of it would have been. 5 As his business grew, Strahan accepted more of such work. By 1766, it was relatively common for customers to use Strahan's paper in the smaller contracts for job work. However, even though the incidence of entries "with paper" increased through the years, it was still the exception rather than the rule. On one occasion, Strahan actually made a special note in the printing entry when a customer for a very small job did provide his own paper. Although the wording is unique in the ledgers, the entry serves to confirm the date when "with paper" entries became common. Mr. Bingley 1766 June 1000 Bills (his own Paper) [£] 0.7.6 [Ledger B 74r; from category one: "Special Entries"] 4) Paper as an Extra Charge: "Ream-and-Quire" Entries Among the 631 paper entries, the largest single category, 471 entries, is that in which Strahan recorded paper as a separate, "extra" charge on a separate line following the standard printing entry for the particular job. The amount of detail varied from one entry to another and from one year to another. For example: Wilson and Co. 1752 £ s d June History of Betty Barnes, 2 vol. 25 Sheets No. 1000 &amp;c.mmat; £1:1: 26. 5. - ...................... For 50 R/ of Paper for Do. &amp;c.mmat; 12s. 30.-- [Ledger B 2r] Mr. John Lockman 1741 £ s d March 26 To printing Verses to a Lady of Quality, one Sheet 4 to 500 Coarse, and 175 fine 0.16.0 For a ream of Coarse Paper for Do. 0.15.0 For 2 Quires fine 0. 4.0 For 6 Quires finest 0.15.0 [Ledger A 18v] The distinction between this ream-and-quire method of entry and the "with paper" entry is a fine one, probably determined by (a) the customer's wish to have paper itemized and (b) Strahan's need to have a bookkeeping record. The method may also have been in part a "sales device" (still used by printers today) of demonstrating to the customer, by billing the item separately, that the cost of his paper was as great as the cost of setting, correcting, and printing the job. In one entry, Strahan changed the billing after the contract had been recorded, from ream-and-quire to "with paper." From this significant entry, we can see not only the close relationship between the two methods of recording paper, but also a clear example of the bookkeeping method Strahan must have employed: "roughing in" a skeleton entry of the contract before he finished the job and could put in the details of actual work and consequent price. This method provided him with a running, up-to-date list of the jobs in work for a customer, and at the same time allowed the customer to make changes without forcing Strahan to cross out or rewrite an entry: George Whitefield 1734/4 £ s d and Paper of [ sic ] Janry. For printing / a New Edition of the 20 Serm[ons] &amp; Prayers, No. 2000 91.13.0 For Reams of Paper for Do. &amp;c.mmat; 10s, 6d. p. Ream [no charge] [Ledger A 5v] In a little over half of the ream-and-quire entries, 253 out of 471, Strahan recorded evidence of how much the customer paid per ream: the "unit price," which naturally was not the wholesale price but included Strahan's markup. In thirty-eight of these entries, the price is known because exactly one ream of paper was used: the price per ream of paper is the same as the total price for paper. But in the remaining 215 entries, Strahan actually recorded the price per ream. In 130 of the 253 entries, Strahan also recorded the kind of paper used — both size and quality. I shall use this information in the second half of this study to reconstruct the scale of prices Strahan charged. The existence of 631 entries mentioning paper cannot be considered a "mistake" but is rather an indication that Strahan was using a system to record the use of paper: the four categories discussed above comprise that system. Further, these four categories divide naturally into two larger groups: 1) seventy-two entries indicate that Strahan had methods for recording certain special considerations when the customer provided the paper; 2) 559 entries indicate that Strahan had two methods for recording jobs when he supplied the paper. The latter two methods for occasions when the customer did not supply the paper provide the final evidence necessary to prove conclusively that the customer did supply the paper in standard practice. If we consider the 559 entries as "exactly half" of the occasions when Strahan supplied paper (for purposes of clarity), then the total number would be 1,118 out of the 18,129 entries of Ledgers A, B, D and F. We have seen that Strahan mentioned paper in 7% of the entries; now we see that Strahan supplied paper in 6% of the entries while the customer supplied it 94% of the time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Scale for Paper From the four categories of entries gathered from the printing ledgers, particularly from category four, it is possible to tell that Strahan's business had available to it a wide selection in size and quality of paper, that a systematic scale of prices was in effect at his shop, and that spoilage allowances were controlled and consistent. Strahan described paper according to the size and the quality of the sheet when he made an entry necessitating detail; i.e. in 169 of the entries in categories one and four. One size, Demy, was much more popular than any other; Medium was the next most popular, followed by Royal, which was used primarily for split runs. The paper sizes are listed below, together with the number of instances at each size. As I showed in my earlier article, we have enough evidence to tell that octavo and large octavo were the folding sizes most often used by Strahan. Now we see in a separate group of entries that this correlates exactly with the most popular sheet sizes: Demy can fold to an octavo and Medium can fold to a large octavo, allowing a moderate margin. 6 The quality distinctions among the various kinds of paper recorded in Strahan's ledgers are quite separate from the size distinctions. Strahan called the regular mill run of paper "common" or "coarse" when he used any term. After "common," the paper rose in price as the quality rose, with distinct groups of terminology at each level: Cheapest: common or coarse Intermediate: thick fine thick; fine; superfine finest Expensive: writing fine writing finest writing Strahan's price per ream to the customer varied with the size of the sheet and the quality of the sheet, but not with the number of reams purchased: large and small orders were charged at the same rates in the ledgers. Following is a reconstruction of Strahan's scale of prices to the customer, taken from 130 instances in category four which showed details of size, quality and price. I have indicated multiple examples at each price in parentheses. In the light of the fluctuating prices charged by paper merchants, it is not surprising that Strahan's prices to his customers varied widely for the same kind of paper; however, the prices did not increase markedly over the years. For example, common Demy ranged in price from thirteen shillings to one pound a ream, but I found the lowest price in 1780 and the highest in 1768. This apparent anomaly can be explained in two ways. It would seem that as the number of paper mills increased and their methods improved, they could give better value for the money charged, or charge less for a paper which had originally cost a great deal to produce. It would also seem that Strahan, as his company grew in size and importance, was able to arrange more favorable contracts with papermakers, thereby keeping his paper prices to the customers at a competitively low price. However, these speculations cannot be conclusively proven by reference to the evidence we can gain from the ledgers now available. 7</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Spoilage Since the ream of paper was not necessarily a standard amount in the eighteenth century, it is necessary to begin the discussion of spoilage by pointing out that Strahan used a ream of 516 sheets and a "culled quire" of twenty-five sheets when he set out paper at the press for a job in which he was providing it. That is, the ream was made perfect and then sixteen sheets were allowed for spoilage above the count of 500. The charges to the customer, as in the reconstructed Scale of Prices above, were couched in terms of the ream made perfect; but the price per ream included not only a markup for the service of providing the paper but also a markup to cover the cost of the spoilage allowance. Strahan's practices in this respect are quite similar to Richardson's. The only difference between the two printers is that Strahan added spoilage above the count whereas Richardson apparently did not. 8 Strahan's standard practice was to take the allowance of sixteen sheets per ream as a sufficient spoilage allowance, regardless of the length of the run, the number of formes to be printed or the difficulties caused by bastard runs or formes: The fact that Strahan only had to increase the spoilage allowance approximately ninety-four times in forty-eight years in business is a good indication of the efficiency of his company — and of his wise choice of customers. 9 An examination of the entries indicates a variety of reasons for increased spoilage, to judge from details in the forty-seven entries recorded. Probable Reasons for Increase Instances Two or more difficulties indicated per entry . . . . . . 19 One difficulty indicated per entry, viz: --split runs (paper change) 9 --quarter sheet imposition required 3 --heavy corrections or alterations 2 --multiple runs (same paper) 2 --stitching of copies after the run 2 --cancellation of a sheet 1 . . . . . 19 No obvious reasons indicated in wording of entries . . . . 9 --- 47 I do not mean to imply that the causes listed separately above or the presence of two or more difficulties in a job always resulted in an increase in spoilage. On the contrary, Strahan completed most of the contracts in the ledgers without an increase, as we have seen. The presence of nine split runs in the list seems significant until we find that every one was ordered by a single customer: Major General Andrew Stuart. He is also represented six times in the group of entries in which two or more difficulties apparently caused increase in spoilage. All fifteen jobs occurred in 1784-85 when Stuart was publishing books about the war with the Colonies and about political economy. Stuart is significant in two other ways, however. First, he is the only customer who consistently re-ordered split runs in which the size and quality of the paper were changed. Stuart's marked preference was for 350 copies on Demy and 150 copies on Writing Medium. Secondly, Stuart is one of very few customers about whom a personal remark is made in the ledgers. Even though Stuart ordered expensive printing and paid his bills within a year or two, he demanded a good deal of special attention. For years the ledgers record his orders for alterations and corrections, night work and Sunday work, cancellations, reprints and bindery work — all without comment. Then, two months after Strahan's death when his son Andrew had taken over management of the shop, one entry in the middle of Ledger F, folio 81 recto, gives us a rare glimpse of the printer's exasperation: 1785 Septr. Papers and Correspondence from July 1783. 16 Sheets, No. 500. with many Corrections &amp;c.mmat;£2:2: (cheap) [£]33.12.0 Of greater significance is the fact that nineteen of the entries indicate at least two possible reasons for increase in spoilage. One of these entries reads: Messrs. Geo. and Thos. Wilkie 1785 £ s d Febry Short Essay on the Modes of Defence best adapted to the Situation of this Island, 6 Sh. No. 500, &amp;c.mmat; £1: 6. 6.0 One Sheet cancelled for 2d Edit. No. 300 1. 1.0 7 R/ of Paper for Do. &amp;c.mmat;18s. 6. 6.0 Corrections and Sunday Work 3. 3.0 [Ledger F 16r] I believe it is apparent from this discussion that when the ledger entries are detailed enough to give us the information, we find increase in spoilage is amply justified by the difficulties in the job. 10 It follows that anyone using Strahan's ledgers for information about a particular book should look upon an increase in spoilage as highly significant and should try to find reasons — either in the ledgers or in other sources. Even when the entries give meager detail, a knowledge of Strahan's standard practice can often resolve an apparent anomaly: Mr. John Osborne 1748 Janry Roderick Random 30 ½ Sheets No. 2000 &amp;c.mmat;£1:16 [£]54.18.0 Two Reams of Paper for Do. 1. 4.0 [Ledger A 62v] A student of literature could be quite upset about this entry for the first edition of a famous novel (or part of it) obviously requiring at least 122 reams, unless he knew the methods of the ledgers. It seems to me fairly obvious that the bookseller Osborne didn't send enough paper, so Strahan provided the balance and charged him for it. The literary problem is not why Strahan entered a peculiar transaction but why Osborne didn't send the paper. We see, then, that Strahan used paper and charged for paper in a pattern of procedure which began with the contract between him and the customer. In standard practice, the customer bought his own paper. Strahan used a ream of 516 at the press. The customer had a right to expect that spoilage would stay within the sixteen sheets of ream allowance unless some unusual difficulty arose. A few customers asked for detailed summaries of paper received or used. A wide variety of size and quality of paper was available to the customer from a wide selection of paper suppliers: eight sizes with nine quality distinctions are mentioned in the ledgers, as are the names of a number of suppliers in addition to Strahan. However, the customer usually chose common Demy, which could easily fold to the octavo size so popular in Strahan's business. On the few occasions when the customer ordered a split run of copies, he tended to order Demy and Royal rather than change the quality of paper. Such was the standard practice, 94% of the time. In the remaining 6% of his business, Strahan supplied the paper. Sometimes, when the contract was a small one, he agreed to a contract "with paper," in which the charge for setting, correcting and printing included the charge for paper as well. Most of the time, however, he recorded the contracts for which he supplied paper by itemizing the reams and charges in separate entries. He roughed in skeleton entries as the job was in work and then filled in the blanks when the job was finished. Strahan charged the customer on a scale in which size and quality determined price; it is assumed that he added a profit markup. The scale fluctuated with the paper market, but the general relationship of prices within the scale remained constant and the prices did not increase markedly over the years. The cost of paper was about half the total cost of printing a work in the eighteenth century, as it is today. Strahan's printing ledgers indicate that he was conservative in his use of paper stock and consistent in his methods of charging for and recording this costly necessity. The regularity of method throughout the ledgers and the scope of the ledgers, forty-eight years from 1738 to 1785, combine to give us a good indication of the practices that probably prevailed in large London shops during the period.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 See P. Hernlund, "William Strahan's Ledgers: Standard Charges for Printing, 1738-1785," SB , XX (1967) for explanation of terms and other information basic to the present study. 2 The approximate total number of entries in these ledgers was found as follows. For Ledgers A, B and D, the entries on sixty pages were counted, divided among beginning, middle and end of each ledger. The average number of entries for these pages was found, the result was multiplied by the remaining number of pages, and finally the total for the sixty pages previously counted was added to reach the total. For Ledger F, forty pages were counted and averaged, and then all entries to the end of 1785 were counted from folio 5or to the end of the ledger. Entries are defined as separate chargeable units (regardless of debit or credit, how long they were, or how much information they contained), names of customers heading accounts, the totals for the accounts, and comments by Strahan. I did not include indexes, end papers, or inserts. The totals for each ledger were: Ledger Total Entries, Approximate A 6,768 B 4,714 D 2,620 F 4,027 to the end of 1785 ------ 18,129 3 Suppliers of manufactured products and of services are mentioned so often in the ledgers that a separate study would be necessary to indicate their identities and their importance to Strahan and his customers. In the eleven instances in which the customers specified paper suppliers, it is probable that Strahan recorded the names as a check against warehouse receipts, since he did not record the professions of the suppliers or details of the shipments. The names are: Bloss and Johnson, Chapman (twice), Grosvenor (twice), Herbert, Johnson, Johnson and Unwin, Johnston, Stiles, Wilkinson. Elsewhere in the ledgers are forty-six entries which specifically list the names of fifteen stationers. Only two of these entries are in the main printing ledgers A, B, D and F; forty-four are found in Ledgers H, K, M and O. Furthermore the entries have no immediate connection with Strahan's charges for paper. Therefore, I have not included them in the categories in the text. However, a list of them is given below. The reader will note that some of the names coincide with the list above. Wording of the list is Strahan's: Mr. Baker, Stationer; Mr. Bailis, Stationer; Mr. Bloxam, Stationer; Messrs. Bowles (also listed as "Mr. Bowles, Stationer," "Thos. Bowles"); Bowles &amp; Ware; Mr. Browne, Stationer; Mr. Chapman, Stationer; Mr. Curtis, Stationer; Foudienier &amp; Co., Stationers; Mr. Grosvenor ("for paper"); Mr. Johnson, Stationer (also listed as "Mr. Job Johnson for Paper"); Mr. Johnson and Unwin [ sic ]; Mr. Lepard, Stationer; Mr. Revell (seven entries for Demy paper); Mrs. Ware, Stationer; Mr. Webber, Stationer (also listed as "W. Weaber, Stationer"). J. A. Cochrane's notation that Stephen Theodore Janssen was a supplier is mentioned in the introduction, above, Janssen was also a customer for printing. The prevalence of the practice of buying from more than one supplier, and certainly of receiving deliveries from more than one, is amply documented. Herbert Davis, in "Bowyer's Paper Stock Ledger," Library , 5 Ser., VI (1951), mentions four suppliers whose names are the same as suppliers to Strahan: Bloss, John Bowles &amp; Son, E. Johnson &amp; Co. and Johnson (pp. 76, 78). He indicates that Bowyer bought at first from three leading Stationers: Thomas Brewer, Samuel Hoole and Samuel Sheafe (pp. 75-76). Several other suppliers of paper are mentioned in the article. Philip Gaskell, in John Baskerville: A Bibliography (1959), indicates that Baskerville "used many different sorts of paper at his press, some of which is identifiable as deriving from Whatman's mill, . . . and several times mentioned buying printing paper" (pp. xx-xxi). In A Bibliography of the Foulis Press (1964), Gaskell comments that "my impression is that none of the Foulises bought their paper exclusively from any single source, but patronised several mills or warehouses" (p. 27). 4 The practice of printing on two kinds or sizes of paper — what I have called "split runs" — can be seen in descriptions of the practices of Bowyer (Davis, pp. 81, 85, 86), the Foulises (Gaskell, Foulis , p. 22) and Cambridge University Press (McKenzie, II, 296, 340). I. G. Philip lists a particularly interesting split run at Oxford in 1759 in William Blackstone and the Reform of the Oxford University Press in the Eighteenth Century , Oxford Bibliographical Society Publications, New Ser., VII (1957 for 1955) in which 200 copies on "a coarser Paper" were designed "for foreign markets" (pp. 104-105). Though this example indicates a change in quality, I cannot discern that quality was changed more often or less often than size was changed at the printing companies mentioned above. It does appear to be true that Bowyer's customers changed size oftener than quality and that the Foulises' customers changed quality oftener. The intricacies involved in any description involving split runs can be seen in D. F. Foxon's "'Oh! Sophonisba ! Sophonisba ! Oh!'," SB , XII (1958), pp. 204-213. 5 Richardson used this alternate "jobbing" method of contracting for work on a basis of "Paper included" (Philip, Oxford, p. 127; Sale, p. 78). Bowyer not only used the jobbing entries, he even kept separate account books for paper used in "Proposals, Proof paper, Errata sheets, Titles, and . . . [possibly] 'wrapping'," as well as for "Bishops' Charges, Indentures, Lawyers' Cases, Receipts, Bills for Hogs and Pigs, and . . . Paper for Gold Coin" (Davis, p. 87). 6 Strahan did not mention inches in referring to sizes. The inch measurements used in the text are taken from Table V of Philip Gaskell's "Notes on Eighteenth-Century British Paper," Library , 5 Ser., XII (1957), 41, supplemented by additional information from Gaskell's Baskerville , p. xvi. The practice of referring to paper by size and quality, or "dimensions" and "group," was widespread. For example, Richardson used the double designation (Sale, pp. 24, 78, 81), as did Bowyer (Davis, p. 75), the Foulises (Gaskell, Foulis , pp. 23, 26), Oxford (Philip, p. 98), and Cambridge (McKenzie, I, 22, 144 and II, passim ). When the Wolvercote Mill was inventoried in 1782 there were moulds for "printing and writing papers of eight sizes" from double crown to pot. See Harry Carter, The Wolvercote Mill , Oxford Bibliographical Society, New Ser., Extra Pub. (1957), pp. 23, 67. Super Royal, Medium and Post were fairly recent sizes in paper, having been brought to popularity early in the century by the first manufacturers to enlarge sheet sizes for the purpose of lowering the tax fees of their customers. See Allen T. Hazen, "Eighteenth Century Quartos with Vertical Chain Lines," Library , 4 Ser., XVI (1935), 337; Graham Pollard, "Notes on the Size of the Sheet," Library , 4 Ser., XXII (1941), 126-29. 7 A view contrary to my speculations can be seen in D. C. Coleman, The British Paper Industry, 1495-1860: A Study in Industrial Growth (1958). Coleman states that in the eighteenth century "there were neither sensational technical advances drastically to lower costs of production nor sweeping extensions in markets to carry this [paper] industry forward in the way that the cotton and iron industries were carried forward" (p. 90). However, Coleman's study covers many centuries and his statements are necessarily generalized. The fact remains that Strahan's prices did not increase markedly. 8 Richardson's practice is described in Sale, pp. 25, 81, Bowyer's is described throughout Davis's article, but particularly on p. 76. See also Moxon, ed. Davis and Carter, pp. 321-322; Caleb Stower's The Printer's Grammar (1808), pp. 402-406; Gaskell's "Notes," pp. 34, 41n; Phillips's Oxford , p. 98; and Allan Stevenson's Observations on Paper as Evidence , Univ. of Kansas Publications: Library Series No. 11 (1961), p. 21. In lieu of a long argument and charts, I offer two examples of how I determined the size of the ream. 1) One ream and 5 quires are sufficient to print one sheet in 632 copies only if the ream is 516, in which case there would be a spoilage allowance of nine sheets (Ledger B 15v, 1756). 2) Three reams are sufficient to print 4 ½ sheets in three runs of 60, 25, 250 (totalling 335) only if the ream is 516 sheets, in which case there would be a spoilage allowance of 8 ½ sheets for each press (Ledger F 39v, 1779). 9 We can obtain some idea of the efficiency of Strahan's pressmen in staying within the spoilage allowance if we know how many jobs they ran. I have computed the totals for Strahan's first full year in business and the last year of his life. In 1739, the pressmen processed fifty-five work orders for a total of 592,825 impressions (perfected sheets). In 1785, the pressmen processed 289 work orders for a total of 4,403,515 impressions. 10 Some of the entries for paper may give the reader an impression of "extra" charges, but we must remember that the paper is not actually "extra" at all; it is always needed in an amount necessary to complete a given number of copies for a given job. The entries which Strahan considered as "extra" charges were generally for services, rather than materials like paper, and they were primarily for services which were not part of a normal printing contract. These charges will be the subject of the third article in this series of studies of Strahan's ledgers.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Nineteenth-Century English Best-Sellers: A Further List by Richard D. Altick</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In THE ENGLISH COMMON READER (Chicago, 1957) I printed, as Appendixes B and C, lists of best-selling books and of the sales of certain mass-circulation newspapers and periodicals in nineteenth-century England. The following pages contain additions to these lists, with data supplementing entries in the original compilations designated by asterisks. As before, prospective users of these figures should be warned that "no attempt has been made to sift and check them" (for the sufficient reason that the disappearance of the relevant business records makes final verification impossible) and that therefore "they are presented here simply for whatever they are worth." Caveat emptor : the vendor is unable to guarantee his wares. The absence of a number of famous best-sellers from this and the original list is due to the lack of hard figures representing the total copies sold. A roster several times as large as the two lists combined could be assembled from reports of books that sold many editions, the number often being specified. Contemporary statements of this kind may be accepted readily enough as evidence that the books were indeed popular according to the standards then prevailing. But for purposes of comparison, exacting modern scholarship requires to know how many copies were actually sold, and this information cannot be inferred from the bare number of editions. The point is worth brief consideration for the sake of inquirers into the history of nineteenth-century English publishing and popular culture who are confronted, as they often are, with the statement that Mrs. Sherwood's notorious History of the Fairchild Family , for example, or Dean Farrar's Eric, or Little by Little went through "many editions." 1 Two essential points must be kept in mind, one a fact of publishing history, the other of semantics. As to the first, the laconic sentences in the preface to a valuable retrospective catalogue of Macmillan publications (1891) are the best possible summary: "The number of Editions or Reprints of any given book is no accurate guide as to its sale. An Edition may consist of 250 or of 100,000 copies." 2 At the beginning of the century, "750 copies was evidently the standard figure for a serious book of some general interest." 3 In 1818 a Longman partner, Owen Rees, told the Copyright Committee of the House of Commons that the usual first impression (normally synonymous with "edition" at this time) ranged from 500 to 1,000, a statement corroborated before the same body by John Murray. 4 Thirty-six years later, according to a writer in The Times , the figure had hardly increased: "The average edition of works sent forth by our principal publishers," he asserted, "varies from 500 to 1,500 copies, and . . . the sale of 1,500 of a new work is really considered a triumphant speculation." 5 There is abundant evidence that this modest size was typical of the great majority of original editions down into the 1890's, which witnessed the overdue demise of the circulating libraries which had for half a century enforced an economy of scarcity upon the original-edition trade. Meanwhile, however, a combination of circumstances — technological improvements which made possible the cheap mass production of books, the great expansion of the reading public, the appearance of mass-appeal authors like Dickens, and the spreading practice of issuing cheap reprints of standard and recent works — rendered the edition comprising tens of thousands of copies increasingly common. Very occasionally, first editions were of this magnitude. Dickens' part issues are an obvious example, as are Tennyson's volumes after his reputation was established: although the first five editions of In Memoriam seem to have averaged about 5,000 copies each (a fact which immediately placed Tennyson among the best-selling poets), the first edition of the first four books of Idylls of the King (1859) comprised 40,000 copies, a figure matched when four new books of the same poem were published ten years later and far exceeded by Enoch Arden (1864), which had an initial edition of 60,000 copies. 6 Subsequently (1900) the publishers of Marie Corelli's The Master Christian claimed a new first-edition record of 75,000. 7 But these, to repeat, were remarkable exceptions to the prevailing practice. It was in cheap reprint editions, not the original high-priced ones, that a book (if fate so favored it) was produced in multiple thousands of copies. The actual number of thousands depended on various factors — the nature of the book's popularity (it might appeal to a relatively small audience or to an enormous one), the policies of the particular firm involved, and the precise time in the century. Certainly it can be said that each successive decade from the 1830's onward witnessed an increase in the number of large-quantity reprints issued for the expanding mass market as well, generally speaking, as in the size of such editions. But what was an "edition"? The term might apply to a printing intended for a short-term sale to take care of immediate demand, as in the case of most topical or vogue literature; or it might apply to one of the numerous forms in which standard works — Bulwer-Lytton's novels, for instance, or Macaulay's essays — were simultaneously kept in print to accommodate the wide variety of purses with which the Victorian book-buying public was equipped. "Edition" in this merchandising usage simply designated format and had no necessary reference to a single press run; the plates were put back on the press whenever stock ran low, but no matter how many times reprinting occurred, "edition" — singular — it remained. A single edition in this sense could last for many years and comprehend any number of copies. On the other hand, and more important in respect to contemporary computation of a book's popularity, the same flexible terminology permitted publishers, especially in their advertising, to count every fresh impression, no matter how small, as a new edition. For these reasons, the statement on the title page of a nineteenth-century book that it belongs to the "25th edition" is of little significance except as a general indication of popularity. The quantitative and semantic variables are such as to make translation into an explicit number of copies, or even into a useful order of magnitude, almost impossible. Under these circumstances there is little point in admitting to any list of best-sellers books whose publishing record as it comes down to us consists only of an unelaborated statement of the editions through which it passed.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 In the latter case, access to the truth is not noticeably facilitated by inconsistencies in the source. In the bibliography of Farrar's works prefaced to his biography (Reginald Farrar, The Life of Frederic William Farrar [1904], p. xiii) Eric is said to be in its "Thirty-sixth edition, 1903"; yet the text itself asserts (p. 73) that "'Eric' has gone through more than fifty editions." A similar discrepancy is found in connection with Farrar's other famous best-seller, his Life of Christ (1874). The bibliography says (p. xiv): "Ninth edition now [i.e., 1903] being published."

      <field name="heading_text">The Order of Stanzas in Cowley and Crashaw's "On Hope" by George Walton Williams</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a recent article, "The Order of Stanzas in Cowley and Crashaw's 'On Hope,'" SP , LXI (1964), 64-73, Mr. Clarence H. Miller argues that in the 1646 and 1648 editions of Crashaw's Steps to the Temple the order of stanzas in the joint poem "On Hope" is incorrect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Miller points out what is now — thanks to him — perfectly obvious: that in the 1646 edition the Crashaw stanzas (6) and (8 and 9) do not answer in logic or in metaphor the Cowley stanzas (5) and (7) they follow. (The arabic numbers in parentheses give the order found in all seventeenth-century texts of the poem.) He therefore suggests a rearrangement of the last stanzas of the poem, supporting his suggestion (a) on the likelihood of scribal or compositorial error in the preparation of the 1646 edition and (b) on the poetic coherence gained by the change. Though willing to grant both points at once, one is hesitant to accept his conclusion, as it overlooks the fact that in the 1652 edition, Carmen Deo Nostro , the order of Crashaw's poem (not there printed in stanzas) is the same as that in 1646. As it is generally assumed that Crashaw advised Thomas Car, the editor of the 1652 edition, it will be necessary to argue from Mr. Miller's position that Crashaw overlooked the error in the order of stanzas (— not by any means an impossibility, though something of an embarrassment to Mr. Miller's hypothesis).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Miller is certainly correct in separating Crashaw's stanzas (8) and (9) and printing them to follow Cowley's (5) and (7); his insight adds much to the integrity of the poem. His arguments for Crashaw's (6) in final position are less convincing. The theory of compositorial shuffling that he proposes is acceptable, but the argument for the consistency of the imagery is not. He argues that Crashaw's (6) echoes Cowley's (3) and (5); I would suggest that (6) echoes (3) only: Crashaw's erotic image of Hope's golden head dying in the lap of Love does not echo Cowley's weeping cloud of (5) but Cowley's deflowered virgins of (3). Crashaw's (6) then supplements (4) by making a further remonstrance to Cowley's (3). Crashaw's lines 31-34 answer Cowley's 23-24 ('Legacie'), lines 35-40 answer Cowley's 25-26 ('wed,' 'bed'); Crashaw's lines 41-42 answer Cowley's 21-22 ('taster'), lines 45-47 answer Cowley's 25-26 (erotic image), lines 49-50 answer Cowley's 29-30 ('Wine'). Furthermore, Crashaw's (6) — with apologies to Mr. Miller — does not to my mind or ear provide a fitting or a typical conclusion. The poem, I suggest, should be arranged in the following order: On Hope, By way of Question and Answer, betweene A. Cowley, and R. Crashaw. Cowley . (1) Hope, whose weake being ruin'd is Alike, if it succeed, and if it misse. Whom Ill, and Good doth equally confound, And both the hornes of Fates dilemma wound. Vaine shadow! that doth vanish quite Both at full noone, and perfect night. The Fates have not a possibility Of blessing thee. If things then from their ends wee happy call, 'Tis hope is the most hopelesse thing of all. 10 Crashaw . (2) Deare Hope! Earths dowry, and Heavens debt, The entity of things that are not yet. Subt'lest, but surest being! Thou by whom Our Nothing hath a definition. Faire cloud of fire, both shade, and light, Our life in death, our day in night. Fates cannot find out a capacity Of hurting thee. From thee their thinne dilemma with blunt horne Shrinkes, like the sick Moone, at the wholsome morne. 20 Cowley . (3) Hope, thou bold taster of delight, Who, in stead of doing so, devour'st it quite. Thou bring'st us an estate, yet leav'st us poore, By clogging it with Legacies before. The joyes, which wee intire should wed, Come deflour'd virgins to our bed. Good fortunes without gaine imported bee, So mighty Custome's paid to thee. For joy, like Wine kept close, doth better taste If it take ayre before its spirits waste. 30 Crashaw . (4) Thou art Loves Legacie under lock Of Faith: the steward of our growing stocke. Our Crown-lands lye above, yet each meale brings A seemly portion for the Sons of Kings. Nor will the Virgin-joyes wee wed Come lesse unbroken to our bed, Because that from the bridall cheeke of Blisse, Thou thus steal'st downe a distant kisse, Hopes chaste kisse wrongs no more joyes maidenhead, Then Spousall rites prejudge the marriage-bed. 40 Crashaw . (6) Faire Hope ! our earlier Heaven! by thee Young Time is taster to Eternity. The generous wine with age growes strong, not sower; Nor need wee kill thy fruit to smell thy flower. Thy golden head never hangs downe, Till in the lap of Loves full noone It falls, and dyes: oh no, it melts away As doth the dawne into the day: As lumpes of Sugar lose themselves, and twine Their subtile essence with the soule of Wine. 50 Cowley . (5) Hope, Fortunes cheating Lotterie, Where for one prize an hundred blankes there bee. Fond Archer Hope, who tak'st thine ayme so farre, That still, or short, or wide thine arrowes are. Thine empty cloud the eye, it selfe deceives With shapes that our owne fancie gives: A cloud, which gilt, and painted now appeares, But must drop presently in teares. When thy false beames o're Reasons light prevaile, By ignes fatui , not North starres we sayle. 60 Crashaw . (8) Fortune ? alas above the worlds low warres Hope kicks the curl'd heads of conspiring starres. Her keele cuts not the waves, where our winds stirre, And Fates whole Lottery is one blanke to her. Her shafts, and shee fly farre above, And forrage in the fields of light, and love. Sweet Hope ! kind cheat! faire fallacy! by thee Wee are not where, or what wee bee, But what, and where wee would bee: thus art thou Our absent presence, and our future now. 70 Cowley . (7) Brother of Feare! more gaily clad The merrier Foole o'th' two, yet quite as mad. Sire of Repentance! Child of fond desire, That blows the Chymicks, and the Lovers fire, Still leading them insensibly on, With the strange witchcraft of Anon . By thee the one doth changing Nature through Her endlesse Laborinths pursue, And th' other chases woman, while she goes More wayes, and turnes, then hunted Nature knowes. 80 Crashaw . (9) Faith's Sister! Nurse of faire desire! Feares Antidote! a wise, and well stay'd fire Temper'd 'twixt cold despaire, and torrid joy: Queen Regent in young Loves minoritie. Though the vext Chymick vainly chases His fugitive gold through all her faces, And loves more fierce, more fruitlesse fires assay One face more fugitive then all they, True Hope's a glorious Huntresse, and her chase The God of Nature in the field of Grace. 90</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Cowley reprinted his stanzas in The Mistress (1647), he printed them as one poem, "Against Hope," of 40 lines (arranged in stanzas); and he followed these lines with his new poem, "For Hope," also of 40 lines. When Thomas Car printed the poem in the Carmen Deo Nostro (1652), he similarly printed Cowley's poem as one poem of 40 lines; and he followed these lines by Crashaw's "Answer For Hope" as one poem of 50 lines. Cowley's example in 1647 suggests that the parallel in the 1652 edition has some authority (though possibly the authority of only half of the joint authorship; Cowley was in Paris at the time Car published the 1652 edition), and that the arrangement in 1646 is editorial.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The transmission of the text may be reconstructed on the following scheme. Crashaw's friend and editor, preparing "On Hope" for the 1646 edition, noticed how exactly Crashaw's (2) and (4) responded to Cowley's (1) and (3). He therefore decided to alternate the stanzas. Not noticing that stanza (6) also responded to Cowley's (3) he continued his alternation. As a result, he was left with the awkwardness of two stanzas of Crashaw's at the end (8 and 9). Car, preparing the 1652 edition, perhaps on Cowley's advice, printed the two poems as separate units (in the manner of the only other substantive seventeenth-century text, British Museum MS. Harleian 6918). In this non-stanzaic arrangement, Crashaw's lines 11-30, i.e., (4) followed immediately by (6), respond to Cowley's lines 11-20, i.e. (3), and the awkwardness of two final Crashaw stanzas disappears. Furthermore, the 1652 version concludes on a rhapsodic high note, typically Crashavian and responding exactly to Cowley's conclusion. What must be obvious is that Crashaw with characteristic exuberance has provided fifty lines where tradition dictated he should have provided only forty. How best to fit in the usual Crashavian excess is the editor's problem.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Among its incunables, the Stadtbibliothek of Trier numbers a copy of a Latin grammatical tract, the commonplace text of which is probably matched only by the rarity of this edition.

The precise date as given by the colophon is: "xxviij. kalendas marcias 2 Anni octogesimioctaui". In regard to this, the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke (GW 9497) 3 makes the following observation: "Mit dem Datum der Schlussschrift kann der 3. II. 4 nicht gemeint sein, da er 1488 ein Sonntag war. Vermutlich ist der 28. III. 1488 gemeint". It is a matter of record that, in 1488, February 3rd fell on a Sunday. 5 The emended dating of the Gesamtkatalog was accepted by Dr. Maria E. Kronenberg 6 and by Professors Wytze and Lotte Hellinga, 7 in both cases with such reservations as an added "?" implies. To the present writer, the statement in the great German bibliography seemed rather like a gratuitous assumption, especially since a number of books bearing a Sunday date came to mind. Chief among these was the book for which William Caxton's press will always be remembered, the Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory. The colophon of this work sets forth that it was "fynysshed in thabbey westmestre the last day of Juyl the yere of our lord /M/CCCC/lxxxv/". 8 In 1485, July 31st fell on a Sunday. Similarly, the Cicero, Of Old Age (etc.), was printed by Caxton on "the xij day of August the yere of our lord .M. CCCC. lxxxj". 9 Chronological tables show that August 12th was the second Sunday of that month in 1481. The opinion expressed by the Gesamtkatalog in regard to the date of the Belgian incunable raises, of course, the entire question of what is meant by the dates given in such colophons. Certainly, no one will suggest that the fifteenth-century printer was able to complete much more than the printing (say) of a "sheet-per-press-per-day" — obviously nothing so extensive as a folio book of 862 printed pages. What, then, does the date of the colophon represent? It has often been assumed that this precise date indicated the day of the machining of that sheet which contained this information — and this, indeed, seemed perfectly reasonable and logical. If the Gesamtkatalog was correct in the assumption that the printing of a book would not have been completed on a Sunday, then such mundane tasks would certainly never have been undertaken on any of the recognized holy days of the Church. In order to determine whether any incunabula were in fact provided with such dates, the writer made a quick survey of the incunabula produced in the Low Countries, 10 England 11 and Bologna. 12 Quite a few books, indeed, bear the dates of the first four days of Holy Week. 13 Similarly, in the Netherlands, Italy and England, books were occasionally dated as of Christmas Eve. 14 All these may be allowed as suitable dates for the completion of a book — but it seems highly improbable that printing would have been performed on Palm Sunday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday, Easter or Christmas Day, 15 yet we know of a few incunables which do exhibit such dates: Palm Sunday: 27 March 1491 (GW 1159) — "vicesimaseptima Martij" Good Friday: 5 April 1493 (Hain 8683 16 and Bühler 36.A.1) — "quinta Aprilis; Nonis Aprilibus" Holy Saturday: 17 14 April 1487 (BMC IX:166 — IA. 49349) — "xiiij Aprilis" 6 April 1493 (Bühler 33.A.3) — "a di .vi. de Aprile" Easter: 30 March 1483 (Bühler 6.A.14) — "adi. 30. de marzo" Christmas Day: 18 1496 (Bühler 36.A.15) — "octauo Kalendas Ianuarii" How, then, shall one account for such dates? Perhaps it may be true that, in certain circumstances, the printer simply selected some remote target, choosing an arbitrary date about the time when he believed the printing might be completed. This could explain the dates in Holy Week, assuming that the printer set up his type for the colophon quite some time before actual printing began and hit upon some important date without happening to note its special significance. 19 This explanation, however, would be impossible for a Christmas date, 20 since it was not a movable feast. Again, it may be that incunabulists have been too much influenced by the modern respect for accurate dates — and that those found in fifteenth-century books were considered, on occasion and in their own day, merely as approximations. Such an hypothesis may be underscored by the presence of "circiter", which certain Augsburg printers (especially Schüssler and Sorg, early in their careers) 21 prefixed to the exact dates. If, then, dates must occasionally be regarded as mere approximations, it would seem wise not to tamper with a printed date, unless some almost incontrovertible proof for the correctness of the proposed alteration could be advanced. The value of an approximate date would, indeed, be the same as that of an exact one, since nothing more definite can, with any confidence, be proposed to take its place. To return to the Belgian incunable which provoked the present inquiry, it is apparent that February 3rd or March 28th are equally possible solutions for the improper date of the colophon, but it must remain a matter of speculation as to which of these (and conceivably still other dates) the printer actually had in mind. It might, therefore, be wise to date the book as Voulliéme did: "28. Kal. Mart. 1488".</field>

I-VIII, pt. 1 (Leipzig, 1925-40). GW lists 14 editions (nos. 9496-9509). Also cited in this study are: Ludwig Hain, Repertorium bibliographicum (1826-38); J. C. T. Oates, A Catalogue of the Fifteenth-Century Printed Books in the University Library Cambridge (1954); Catalogue of Books Printed in the XVth Century now in the British Museum (1908-62; cited as BMC); and the works listed in notes 7, 11 and 12 below. 4 The date of February 3rd is arrived at by counting back from the Calends of March (March 1st), 1488 being a leap year. According to classical usage, February 3rd would be "III Nonas Februarii". 5 For the dates in this study, use has been made of the enormously handy article by Frederick R. Goff, "The Dates in Certain German Incunabula," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , XXXIV (1940), 17-67. All dates have been rechecked against Adriano Cappelli, Cronologia, Cronografia e Calendario Perpetuo (1930). 6 Campbell's Annales de la typographie néerlandaise au XVe siècle, Contributions to a new Edition (1956), p. 34, no. 717a. 7 The Fifteenth-Century Printing Types of the Low Countries (1966), II, 390. 8 Morgan Library, PML 17560, sig. ee6; Duff 283. 9 PML 778, sig. i3; Duff 103. 10 As listed by the Hellingas (see note 7). 11 E.

Bühler, The University and the Press in Fifteenth-Century Bologna (Notre Dame, Indiana, 1958; cited as Bühler). 13 For the books dated in Holy Week, only a few examples need be cited: Monday: 5 April 1490 (BMC IX:66 — IA. 47806) = "altera die palmarum"; 13 April 1495 (Duff 173) Tuesday: 14 April 1495 (BMC IX:24 — IA. 47188) Wednesday: 26 March 1494 (Oates 3555) = "tercia die post Dominicam Palmarum"; 18 April 1492 (Bühler 32.A.1) Thursday: 19 April 1492 (Bühler 32.A.2; also 6.A.41). Note : Giovanni Giacomo Fontanesi published two books on successive days in Holy Week. However, the second of these (Bühler 32.A.2) includes a letter from Politian dated "xvi. kal' Iun. 1492," which would imply that the book was not issued before 17 May 1492, though BMC VI:838 suggests that Iun. might be a misprint for Ian. The publication of April 18th (the Letters of St. Catherine of Siena) seems quite appropriate for Holy Week, but that of the following day (an abridged Metamorphoses of Ovid in Latin elegiacs) does not. 14 Christmas Eve: 1495, Richard Pafraet (GW 4524) 1476, Annibale Malpigli (Bühler 7.A.4) 1499, Richard Pynson (Duff 341) Erhard Ratdolt, in Venice, issued an edition of Abraham Aben Ezra, De nativitatibus , with the date of Christmas Eve ("nona kalendas Ianuarij"). BMC (V:291 — IA. 20551) interprets the year as 1485, while the GW (113) maintains that the year was 1484. See, also, note 20. 15 For other significant days, one may record two books dated on August 15th (Assumption BMV): Albertus de Saxonia, De proportionibus (Padua: Cerdonis, 1482; BMC VII:920 — IA. 29988) and Alexander de Villa Dei, Doctrinale (Lyons: Jean du Pré, 1489; GW 1035). Also two editions of the Doctrinale (GW 1071/2), both dated "quarto Nonas Nouembris" 1494 (November 2nd = All Souls), were printed in Cologne by Heinrich Quentell. 16 The existence of this book is guaranteed by the Hellingas' notes on the types (II, 408 and 495), where they state: "From MS. GW". The book is also not included in Dr. Kronenberg's list of "Doubtful cases" (pp. 59-112). An Aesop was issued "a di primo Aprile" 1491 in Venice by Benalius and Capcasa (GW 438), another example of Good Friday dating. See also note 19 below. 17 Two further examples with this date are: Aesopus moralisatus (Rome: [Silber], "DIE. XXVIIII. MARCII" 1483 = BMC IV:105 — IA. 19166) and an Albertus Magnus, Compendium theologicae veritatis (Venice: [Locatellus for] Scotus, "io. die Aprilis" 1490 = Hain 443). 18 An Albertus de Padua was printed in Venice by Rottweil and Corvus with the date "8°. Kl'. Janu." 1476 (BMC V:249 — IB. 20582). This is the equivalent of December 25th. 19 Sometimes the printer was fully aware of the precise meaning of his date. Thus, Michael Greyff issued from Reutlingen (in 1489) a Doctrinale with the date: "Sexta feria post palmarum" which can only stand for Good Friday (GW 1155). In like manner, Quentell put out an Albertanus Causidicus Brixiensis in 1489 with the printed date "in profesto pasche" (BMC I:274 — IA. 4542). Thus the work is clearly dated "the day before Easter". 20 A copy in the Morgan Library (PML 93) of the Sermones de tempore et de sanctis by Albertus Magnus, printed by ther Hoernen in Cologne in 1474, has the precise date in the colophon: "Ipso die gloriosi ac sancti profesti natiuitatis domini nostri Ihesu Christi," which unequivocally means Christmas Eve. 21 See BMC II:328/9 and 341/2. At Strassburg, the press styled "Printer of the 1483 Jordanus de Quedlinburg" on at least three occasions dated its productions with "circa" (BMC I:134, 144 and 146) and twice with "post" (BMC I:132 and 141).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">William Barley, Draper and Stationer by J. A. Lavin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although William Barley does not rate an entry in the DNB , other standard reference works, both bibliographical and musicological, memorialize him as one of the first English publishers and printers of music. Grove's Dictionary of Music , for instance, labels him an "English 16th-17th century music printer," and says that Barley, as bookseller, printer and publisher, lived in Newgate Market London . . . and worked until at least 1614. . . . His own printing was done in Little St. Helen's, and was particularly bold and good. (5th ed. 1954, I, 438-39) Charles Humphries and William C. Smith in Music Publishing in the British Isles (1954), describe him as a "Draper, bookseller, printer and publisher," whose "printing was done in Little St. Helen's" (p. 64), and the Oxford Companion to Music tersely identifies him as a "music printer" (9th ed. 1955, p. 86). The Dictionary of Printers 1557-1640 calls him a draper, bookseller, and printer (p. 20), and he is also referred to as a printer in such reference works as McKerrow's Devices (pp. 166, 202). 1 In Bruce Pattison's "Notes on Early Music Printing," The Library (4th Series, XIX, 1939), Barley's printing is discussed, and it is asserted that In 1591 he was committed to prison for irregular printing, and in 1595 fined 40s. for printing three ballads and a book without license. (p. 413) 2 Pattison also states that Barley had printed a number of ballads, that he printed A New Booke of Tabliture in 1596 from wood blocks because he "had no music type at this time," and that "his association with Morley also caused him to print Morley's Ayres (1600), and madrigals by Farmer and Bennet (1599)." The solitary article devoted exclusively to a study of Barley, John L. Lievsay's "William Barley, Elizabethan Printer and Bookseller," SB , VIII (1956), 218-25, of course refers to his printing. Lievsay is at pains to demonstrate that "Barley's rôle among our early printers of music is thus clearly one of considerable importance," (p. 222); that his "name is associated — as printer, publisher, agent, or patentee — with approximately one hundred publications," (p. 218); and that "from 1606 to 1613 all English music books were printed by him or by his assignees," (p. 222). He refers to Barley's "own printing" (p. 218), to "the printing shop in Little St. Helen's" (p. 222), and to how in 1596 "he made shift to print from wooden blocks" (p. 221). Reference is also made to "lesser Elizabethan writers whose works he printed or sold" (p. 225), and Barley himself is categorized as a "law-flouting anti-monopolist printer" (p. 221). All the above statements, and even the title of Lievsay's article, are questionable. Apart from other matters of fact, an examination of the evidence makes it clear that Barley was never a printer. Lievsay points out that So far as his own printing and publishing are concerned, Barley's career falls into two clearly marked active periods separated by a long and unexplained period of virtual silence. The first and more vigorous period extends from 1591 to 1599; the second begins in 1606 and continues to 1614. (pp. 218-19) But a statement made by Barley suggests very strongly that at least during "the first and more vigorous period" of his career he had no printing-press, and that he was not a printer, but a publisher and bookseller. In answer to the third interrogatory put to him in a Star Chamber case on 26 June 1598, Barley said: That he doth knowe that emongest other thinges in the s ai d decree [Star Chamber Decree of 23 June 1586] Conteyned it is there ordered that eu er y p er son w hi ch after the sayd decree made should errecte or sett vp any presse for printing of bookes should w i thin tenne dayes next after such settinge vp thereof bringe a trewe note or c er tifycatt thereof vnto the m aste r &amp; wardens of the Company of Stacyon er s in London vppo n such payne as in the said decree lymitted and this Ex amina t e sayth that he this Ex amina t e for his owne p er son hath not at any tyme since the said decree made sett vp any such presse or presses. 3 Since the Star Chamber Decree in question was dated 23 June 1586, and since Barley completed his apprenticeship with the Drapers' Company in 1587, 4 the only conclusion one can arrive at from his answer (unless he was lying in his teeth) is that in the eleven years since becoming a freeman, and during "the first and more vigorous period" of his career as a publisher (at least up to 26 June 1598), he had not owned a press. This conclusion is borne out by the title-pages of the eighty-five items issued by Barley which are listed in Morrison's Index of Printers, Publishers and Booksellers in STC . Of these, only eleven claim to be printed by him. Of the thirty-nine which he issued before 1599, twenty were "printed for" Barley, and eighteen "sold by" him. A solitary title claims to be printed by Barley ( STC 2495, dated [1598?] by STC , but probably printed in 1599). From the printers' names or initials which appear on twenty-eight of the thirty-nine it is apparent that before 1599 Barley usually employed Thomas Creede (9 items), John Danter (7), or Abel Jeffes (9), to do his printing for him. Simon Stafford printed one, and R. B. two items. Of the ten works printed for Barley before 1599 which do not bear printers' names or initials, it is possible to identify a further five from their ornaments as also coming from Danter's press ( 1593 25122, 1594 20867, 1595 14707, 1596 1433 and 18418). It is evident that what Barley said in his deposition was true, and that the sentence (which seems to have been ignored) in his dedicatory epistle to the Countess of Sussex in A New Booke of Tabliture (1596), is to be taken literally: "I my selfe am a publisher and seller of Bookes, wherby I haue my liuing and maintenance" (sig. A2). The majority of another thirty-nine titles listed in Morrison's Index , which were issued by Barley during the latter half of his career (1606-1613), also bear the name of the printer, and are distributed as follows: Windet 4, East 7, Creede 5, Snodham or the Lownes-Brown-Snodham partnership 7, Allde 2, R. Blore 2, [W.White?] 1, for Barley, or by his assigns 8, and lastly, those claiming to be printed by Barley himself, 3. A glance at the numerous ornaments in these last three items ( 1608 25202, 1609 20759 and 21127) makes it at once apparent that despite their imprints they were printed not by Barley, but by John Windet. 5 This leaves eight items allegedly printed by Barley, of which seven constitute his total recorded output between 1599 and 1606 (five titles in 1599, and one each in 1601 and 1602). The eighth probably belongs to the same period, as mentioned above, but is dubiously dated [1598?] by STC . Of these eight items, two printed in 1599 (13563 and 18131) share an ornamental initial I and clearly came from the same press. Moreover, 13563 displays the McKerrow device 322, which in 1597 was in the possession of the obscure London printer Henry Ballard. McKerrow does not record the fact that 322 had earlier belonged to Richard Tottel (who used it in 1572 in STC 3393), to whom Ballard was apprenticed. It therefore seems significant that the title-page border used in the other book, 18131, is last recorded in the hands of Tottel. We may conclude that 13563 and 18131 were printed for Barley by Henry Ballard. Two of the final six items share a set of initials of conventional floral design, the owner of which I have not yet identified, but breaks in the frame of the S should ultimately make positive identification possible. The other four I have not been able to examine, but they will probably turn out to be the work of one of the printers Barley habitually employed. Although I have not identified the actual printer of every one of the books claiming to be printed by Barley, it should now be clear that he was never a printer, and that the statements concerning his printing which were cited at the beginning of this paper are erroneous. Apart from the central question of Barley's printing, some biographical matters remain. Mr. Lievsay in his second paragraph says of Barley's antecedents: We have his own word that he was born about 1565; but where, deponent sayeth not. Possibly his family was originally of Sussex. Some support for this conjecture may be seen in his being twice before the Court of High Commission for illegal sale of printed matter in the Sussex town of Cowdry, and again in his dedicating two of his publications to residents of that county. (p. 218) Lievsay refers the reader to the Dictionary of Printers and Booksellers 1557-1640 as the source of his information, and there we find this version: From some information supplied by himself in June, 1598, in a deposition, we learn that he was born about 1565, and that on two previous occasions he had been before the Court of High Commission, once for selling a twopenny book relating to Her Majesty's progress, and again for selling a ballad concerning the safe return of the Earl of Essex from Cadiz. Both these sales took place at Cowdry in Sussex. (p. 20) Unfortunately, the main assertion of the above paragraph is a non-fact, a misremembering of what Barley actually said in the deposition from which I have already quoted, made on 26 June 1598. Interrogatories were put to Barley following a raid which the Stationers made on the printing shop of Simon Stafford (also a Draper) on 13 March, 1598. Four thousand pirated copies of The Accidence had been found in the house next door, occupied by Roger Pavier, another Draper, but which had been until shortly before in the possession of William Barley. The illegal volumes were seized, as were Stafford's types, and parts of the press. In his examination Barley stated that he was "aged xxxiij yeeres or thereabowts." The last phrase is a legalism and does not imply any uncertainty about his age or the date of his birth. In answer to the second interrogatory he admitted that he had been twice bound before the High Commissioners in causes ecclesyastycall abowt the sellinge of book s the first tyme was for that he had sold a booke of ij d of her ma ties p ro gress to Cowdrie in Sussex &amp; the second time was for that he had sold balladds wherein the safe &amp; happie retorn of the right ho therle of Essexe Erle marshall of England was wished or prayed for when his honor went the Cales voyage 6 Elizabeth's Progress to Cowdray lasted from 15 to 21 August 1591, and is described in John Nichols, The Progresses and Public Processions of Queen Elizabeth (1823), III, 90-96, who reprints an account from a pamphlet now in the British Museum ( STC 3903, the title-page of which differs somewhat from Nichols's transcription, given below): The Honorable Entertainment given to her Majestie, in Progresse, at Cowdray in Sussex, by the Right Honorable the Lord Montecute, anno 1591, August 15 . Printed by Thomas Scarlet, and are to bee solde by William Wright, dwelling in Paules Churchyard, neere to the French Schoole. 1591. Since Scarlet was requested to appear before the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1591 (Arber, I, 548), it is possible that he and Barley were in trouble over this same pamphlet. I cannot identify the ballad about the Earl of Essex, but it is interesting that Barley (unlike the Dictionary of Printers ), refers to the expedition as the Calais voyage. Calais was besieged by the Duke of Parma in 1596, and the English force sent to relieve it was diverted to Cadiz only after the town fell. Thus, Barley never did sell "printed matter" or anything else illegally "in the Sussex town of Cowdry" (so far as we know); consequently, he was never prosecuted for doing so; and, therefore, no support for the conjecture that he was from Sussex is to be found in his "being twice before the Court of High Commission for illegal sale of printed matter in the Sussex town of Cowdry." We now know that in fact he was from Woburn in Bedfordshire. 7 The latter part of this note concerns Lievsay's contention that there was something irregular or clandestine about Barley's joining the Stationers. He remarks: He [Barley] first appears in the London records as a member of the Drapers' Company, his term of apprenticeship in the company ending in 1587. Apparently there is no record of his translation from the Drapers' to the Stationers' Company, which must have taken place shortly thereafter. Such translations were not uncommon; but in Barley's case the change must have involved some irregularity. It is difficult, otherwise, to account for the fact that a man who had followed the stationer's trade for sixteen years should be made free of the Company only so late as 1606. Whatever may be the fact behind his obscure and possibly clandestine entry into the ranks of the Stationers . . . (p. 218) There are no grounds for assuming that Barley's translation to the Stationers' Company "must have taken place shortly . . . after" the completion of his apprenticeship with the Drapers, and all the evidence suggests that it did not. As Lievsay himself points out (note 6), we know that Barley was admitted as a freeman of the Stationers' Company in 1606 (Arber, III, 29, 683). Even more to the point is Barley's answer to the fourth interrogatory put to him on 26 June 1598, which asked whether he was familiar with that provision of the Star Chamber decree of 23 June 1586 governing the excessive number of printers and the procedure for allowing the erection of new presses. He was reminded that the decree ordered that no person should set up a press unless elected from among the free Stationers by the Master and Wardens of the Company under the direction of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London. He was asked whether at any time he had been so elected and allowed, and of what Company in London he was free. He said he knew the provision, and that he this ex amina t e was not at any tyme heretofore so ellected or allowed of as ys menc i oned in the s ai d decree and this Exa mina t e sayth further that he this ex amina t e is free of the Company of Drap er s in london. (Judge, pp. 170-171) The last statement makes it certain that at least on 26 June 1598 Barley had not yet been translated. Further evidence is supplied by various entries in the parish register of St. Peter's upon Cornhill, which have not been cited by anyone writing about Barley, and which seem not to have been used by the compilers of A Dictionary of Printers and Booksellers 1557-1640 (1910), even though the register was published by The Harleian Society in 1877 (ed. G.W.G.L. Gower). The relevant entries follow: 1603 June 15 [Weddings] Wedensday: William Barley of this parish booke seller: And Mary Harper of this parish allso, by bannes thrise asked 1604 June 9 [Christenings] Satterday: Katherin Barley daughter of William Barley Draper, the childe born one satterday fourtenth night afore.

This solitary instance does not, however, contradict the statement by William E. Miller in his very useful "Printers and Stationers in the Parish of St. Giles Cripplegate 1561-1640," SB , XIX (1966), 16: "I have been unable to find any correlation between the use of stationer in the registers and admission to the Freedom of the Stationers' Company." The use of the old designation by the parish clerk when recording Marie Barley's christening in 1607 is further evidence that Barley was established in his neighbours' minds as a Draper and bookseller. The most interesting, and certainly the most surprising information supplied by these entries, is the revelation that Barley, a tradesman, was on terms of some intimacy with Sir Edward Stanhope, a gentleman directly concerned with the regulation of the booktrade. Canon of St. Paul's Cathedral and chancellor of the diocese of London, Stanhope acted for Archbishop Whitgift in matters affecting the press, though his name appears only once in the Registers as a licenser (of Bacon's Essays ; Arber, III.79). In April 1601 he was a commissioner in the inquiry concerning piracies, and after being knighted on 25 July 1603 he served on the commission under which Raleigh was tried for high treason, and he was appointed one of the four learned civilians who were to examine and adjudicate upon all books printed in the realm without authority. He bequeathed money and books to Trinity College, Cambridge, (where W. W. Greg was at one time Stanhope Librarian). I have not identified Lady Granger. Finally, not only is it not difficult to account for Barley following the stationer's trade for sixteen years before he was translated, but his entry into the ranks of the Stationers was neither irregular, obscure, not clandestine. Simon Stafford had been "brought up and exercised in the art and trade of printing" for over twenty years as a Draper before he was translated to the Stationers on 7 May 1599, as he tells us himself (Judge, p. 177). By the custom of London a Freeman of the City was entitled to pursue any trade he chose, even though his apprenticeship might have been in a trade unconnected with his occupation. A. H. Johnson came across members of the Drapers' Company pursuing the following trades during the reign of Elizabeth: the retailing of linen cloth and of mercery, embroidering, upholstery, felt-making, silk-weaving, and wine-selling, 'occupying oils, butter, cheese, and vinegar,' that is, grocery. To these we must add an apothecary, a smith, a gunner, two pewterers, a salter, a woadmonger, and a bookbinder, several barber-surgeons, painter-stainers, printers, booksellers and stationers. 8 On the other hand, Christopher Barker, the Queen's Printer, tells us that in 1582 booksellers, bookbinders, joiners, and chandlers were free of the Stationers' Company. 9 So, we may add, was Robert Crowley, vicar of St. Giles's, Cripplegate (Arber, II, 679). The craft gilds strenuously opposed this encroachment on their rights, but as their power weakened during Elizabeth's reign the privilege was more frequently claimed. One solution was to set over or translate the offending individual to the craft he was pursuing. Christopher Barker, with whom Stafford served his apprenticeship, was a Draper pursuing the trade of Stationer, and was himself translated from the former company to the latter in 1578. The Drapers and the Stationers seem to have regarded as a test case the suit brought by the Stationers against William Barley and Simon Stafford, which would determine whether the custom of London permitted Drapers to function as printers. The raid on the houses of Barley and Stafford and the Star Chamber case which followed it were merely the culmination of a series of legal manoeuvres which stretched back some years, and which included, in 1596, an attempt by the Drapers to establish the right to have their own printer, for which purpose they retained the services of none other than Edward Coke, the Attorney-General and future Chief Justice (Johnson, II, 170). That the test case succeeded in reaffirming the Stationers' monopoly is seen in the translation of Stafford to the Stationers on 7 May 1599, and in the fact that between 1600 and 1602 fourteen other Drapers were similarly translated (Johnson, II, 171). William Barley was not one of them, which returns us to the question of his "long and unexplained period of virtual silence," and second active period, 1606-1614. It will be noticed at once that the beginning of this second period coincides with Barley's admission to the Stationers' Company in 1606, which suggests that the preceding years of silence are to be explained by his not then being a member of the Company. It will further be noticed that his period of silence begins following the Star Chamber case of 1598. The Privy Council Order of 10 September 1598 which records the judgement in the case between Stafford and the Stationers makes no mention of Barley, merely indicating that the parties have agreed to translate Stafford to the Stationers, until which time he is forbidden to print (Greg and Boswell, Records , p. 64). His seized printing materials were redelivered to him on 5 March 1599, and he became a freeman on 7 May. Why was the same arrangement not made for Barley? I think the answer is contained in Stafford's reply to the fourth interrogatory (Judge, pp. 170-171). This makes it very clear that the point at issue was not really pirated books (none were found on his premises, and Barley no longer occupied the house where they were found), but whether or not a man who had worked as a printer for twenty years, and who had served the required seven years' apprenticeship in the printing trade, albeit to a master who was then a Draper, was to be permitted to operate a press. The Archbishop of Canterbury had been approached on several occasions by Stafford's influential friend (and perhaps relative) Sir Edward Stafford, 10 on the printer's behalf, but had insisted on being certified by the Stationers that Stafford had been brought up and served as an apprentice in that trade the space of seven years, before he would allow Stafford to erect a press. When the Stationers, because Stafford was a Draper, refused so to certify, he appealed to the Lord Mayor, who in May 1597 ordered the Recorder and Council to examine the question. They found for Stafford, whereupon the Mayor and Aldermen wrote to the Archbishop, supporting Stafford's plea. His Grace then discussed the matter with the Attorney General (Edward Coke!) and Stafford was permitted to print. On 4 August 1597 the Stationers obtained a Star Chamber injunction to stop Stafford's printing, and it was this defence of their monopoly which lay behind their raid on his premises of 13 March 1598. I conclude that though, like Stafford, Barley had served his time as a Draper, unlike Stafford he had not been brought up in the trade of printing. For that reason the compromise achieved by Stafford, and later extended to cover other Drapers with printing experience, could not apply to Barley. The period of silence preceding Barley's admission to the Stationers' Company is the highly significant one of seven years, during which time one might have expected him to have remedied this defect. However, this seems not to have been the case. McKenzie ( Stationers' Apprentices , p. 108) records the fact that Barley bound himself to Thomas Phipps on 30 April 1606 for seven years, but as mentioned above, within two months he was freed by translation from the Drapers (on 25 June 1606). It cannot be a coincidence that on the same day the Court of the Stationers' Company settled a dispute between Barley and Thomas East, supporting Barley's claim to a patent for the printing of all music books, which had originally been granted to Thomas Morley by the queen. Under the terms of the settlement East, as the assign of Barley, was permitted to print music books he had lawfully entered, but had to pay Barley twenty shillings in each instance, and provide him with six sets of the song books he printed. 11 Barley's apprenticeship to Phipps must have been intended to strengthen his claim to Morley's patent, perhaps by signalling his readiness to submit to the authority of the Stationers' Company. Whether his translation from the Drapers was agreed upon on 25 June 1606 earlier or later than the Court's decision cannot be determined, but the Stafford case suggests that Barley's acceptance by the Stationers was probably part of the settlement.</field>

Device No. 304 is probably the only printing material Barley possessed (see below). 2 Barley was actually arrested for contempt (Arber, I.555), and said himself that this arrest and the later fine were for selling unlicensed books (see below). Pattison merely assumed that his crime was "irregular printing." 3 C. B. Judge, Elizabethan Book Pirates (1934), p. 170. Italics indicate expanded contractions. 4 Percival Boyd, The Roll of the Drapers' Company of London (1934), p. 12. 5 On this subject Greg remarked: "But it was quite common at the time to speak of 'printing' a book when what was meant was getting it printed, or publishing it. Some stationers regularly used the term in this sense in their imprints, as John Walley (1546-82), Robert Crowley (1549-57), and Anthony Kitson (1550-65) earlier, and later Richard Jones (1565-1600). Jones, it is true, possessed a press, but it is not known whether any of his numerous books were printed on it." (W. W.

The Woburn Register does not record the baptism or burial of Barley. Entries in 1601 and 1604 record the baptisms of Elizabeth and Alice, daughters of a Wm. Barly (information supplied by Miss D. Summers, Bedfordshire Record Office), but that he was the publisher seems unlikely (see the entries from the St. Giles's register below). 8 A. H. Johnson, The History of the Worshipful Company of the Drapers of London (1915), II, 165. 9 Arber, I.114. 10 Whether Sir Edward Stafford, Ambassador to France 1583-90, who died intestate in 1605 was a relative of Stafford the printer has not been determined, but his attempts to help Simon suggest that he was. He was a friend worth having; his mother, who died only a year before him, aged 78, was an intimate of the Queen. Her epitaph in St. Margaret's Church, Westminster, records that "She served Queen Elizabeth 40 years, lying in the bedchamber." It may have been this Lady Stafford, rather than Sir Edward's wife, who helped Simon buy a house in 1600 (Arber, III.103). 11 W. A.

      <field name="heading_text">Two Compositors in Heywood's Londons Ius Honorarium (1631) by David M. Bergeron</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1631, Thomas Heywood, already well established as a man of letters, turned his hand to civic pageantry. In fact, this decade of pageantry in a sense belongs to him, for by 1639 he had produced some seven Lord Mayor's Shows (1631-33, 1635, 1637-39), a number exceeded only by the indefatigable Anthony Munday earlier in the century. This first show by Heywood, Londons Ius Honorarium (STC 13351; Greg, Bibliography , no. 448), was printed by Nicholas Okes, as were many of Heywood's other works. For example, Okes printed three of Heywood's pageants (1631-33); and after his death, his son John Okes printed three more (1637-39), making a total of six of the seven mayoralty entertainments. The quarto edition of the 1631 show survives in four extant copies preserved in the Huntington, Yale, Harvard, and Bodleian libraries. Though the quarto pamphlet which describes the 1631 pageant is brief (it collates sigs. A1-C4 v ), it shows evidence of two compositors setting the type; this is demonstrated by peculiarities of spelling and running-titles. The habits of one of these compositors seem to be unique among the workmen in Nicholas Okes' print shop. The evidence of press correction suggests much attention given to the section set by one compositor and very little paid to the sheets set by the second compositor. I will offer a tentative reason for this. The most obvious distinction between the two possible compositors is found in the running titles. The first title appears on sig. A4 v , is set in italic type, and reads Londons Ius Honorarium . Throughout sheet B the running titles are again in italics, but the I of Ius is swash italic. But sheet C abandons the swash italic I and returns to the regular italic I as seen in sig. A4 v . Thus sheet B differs in its running titles from sheets A and C. Of interest too is the title of sig. C2 which misspells Honorarium as Honorariuus , an error apparently corrected in the outer forme of sheet C, for there seems to be only one skeleton. The running titles of sig. C1 v and C2 v both contain the same broken o in the first o of Honorarium , which lends support to the likelihood of one skeleton forme. In addition to the running titles one may look throughout the pamphlet to see if the distinction between normal and swash italic capital I holds; by and large it does. In sheet A the swash I is not used at all (cf. the running title on sig. A4 v ), and the normal italic I is used seven times. Sheet B contains four examples of the normal italic I , but the swash I appears some twenty-six times, which of course corresponds to the sheet's running titles. Sheet C returns to the pattern of sheet A— there are two swash italic I 's and fifteen instances of normal italic capital I . I believe we can tentatively conclude on the evidence of the running titles and the distinctive use of the italic I that sheets A and C were set by the same compositor — let us call him Compositor X — and sheet B was set by a different compositor, designated Y. Other spelling tests corroborate this conclusion. The word chief , for example, appears in each sheet, and in A and C it is spelled cheife (sigs. A3, A4, C1 v , C2, and C4). But in sheet B the spelling is chiefe (sigs. B2, B3, and B4). Thus the lines are again drawn between Compositor X who set sheets A and C and Compositor Y who apparently set B. Another distinction is seen in that Compositor X does not use the letter j ; instead, he follows the traditional pattern of using the initial and medial i for j as in iniured (sig. A3) and iurisdiction (sig. A4). But Compositor Y uses j in justice (sig. B1 v ), just and rejoyce (sig. B3), Majestie (sig. B3 v ), which represent all the possibilities for using j , and he has used the letter both initially and medially. What is perhaps the most conclusive evidence for two compositors comes in the use of u and v . Generally, Compositor X, setting sheets A and C, follows what was the traditional printing pattern of using initial v for u and medial u for v . But Y modernizes the practice to use u and v as we do now. In every instance in sheet A (and there are quite a few) the compositor follows the usual u-v substitution. In sheet C this same compositor out of fifty-five possibiliites uses the traditional substitution fifty-three times, the exceptions being governed (C1) and descoveryes (C3). The situation in sheet B is quite different. Out of sixty possibilities the compositor uses the modern pattern of u-v forty-nine times. Nine of the eleven exceptions in sheet B are found in the use of the initial capital V for capital U as in Vpon (once), Vlisses (four times), Vnity (twice), and Vnicorne (twice). The habit of using capital V for initial capital U seems to have persisted for some time after the other u-v patterns were modernized. One of the exceptions here in sheet B results from an error in proofing. In the copy of the Huntington Library line 17 on sig. B4 reads: "If to behold above you. . . .," an example of the modern usage of v . But the same line in the Yale, Harvard, and Bodleian copies reads: "Ist to behold abovt you. . . ." I believe the latter is the corrected state of the line and that the compositor has either failed to note the difference in the meaning and spelling of the word or has made the simplest correction, simply replacing one letter in above rather than two. At any rate, the evidence clearly points to two compositors who set the type for this 1631 quarto pamphlet. It seems somewhat strange that for such a small printing job two compositors should have been utilized; apparently the shop was pressed for time, and it was a busy shop. But there is something seemingly unique about the printing of this quarto by Nicholas Okes. It is generally recognized that the 1630's is more or less the transitional period in which the u-v substitution was eventually abandoned in favor of our modern usage. We are perhaps witnessing in the printing of Heywood's 1631 pageant a clear example of the transition — Compositor X sticks to the old pattern, but Compositor Y employs the modern practice. What is puzzling is that Compositor Y's habit does not re-appear in other material printed by Nicholas Okes during this period. I have now examined something like 2,375 pages issued from Okes' shop during the three years 1630-1632, most of it centered in the year 1631. (This, incidentally, represents the vast majority of Okes' work during the prescribed period.) I have found no other consistent example of the modern usage of u-v , which is the only problem which I explored. Not even Heywood's pageants of 1632 and 1633, printed by Okes, contain the modern practice. Thus Compositor Y either disappeared, changed his habits, or was borrowed from some other shop. The other Heywood pageant quartos, 1635 (printed by Raworth), 1637, 1638, and 1639 (all three printed by John Okes), consistently follow the modern u-v pattern. The press correction of the pamphlet also suggests particular attention given to the work of Compositor Y and sheet B. A study of the press variants indicates that with two exceptions of errors corrected in the outer forme of C all the other corrections are made in sheet B, both formes. This in no way means that A and C are devoid of error — there are a number of manifest errors — it suggests only that the proof correction was for some reason focused on sheet B. Also the corrections in B generally suggest a check against the manuscript — again special care. For example, the Huntington copy on line 6 of sig. B1 v reads: ". . . ther's way to scape"; but the corrected forme found in the other extant copies, Yale, Harvard, and Bodleian, reads: ". . . ther's a way to scape" — compositor justification of the line is not a question here. Again on line 11 of sig. B4 the Huntington copy reads: "May these my two each Ladies ever smile"; but the other corrected copies read: "May these my two Coacht Ladies ever smile." The misprint on sig. B4 v destrsy appears in both the Huntington and Yale copies but is properly spelled destroy in the Harvard and Bodleian copies, which may suggest a second round of correction. For with this one exception the Yale, Harvard, and Bodleian copies agree with one another and contain the corrected formes and the Huntington the uncorrected. At any rate, the point is clear: with only two exceptions all press correction is found in sheet B, and the printed text seems to have been checked against the manuscript for the purpose of proofing. Thus Compositor Y, already distinguished for peculiar habits — i.e., not found elsewhere in the work of Nicholas Okes' shop — is also singled out for special care in the process of press correction while obvious errors in sheets A and C go largely unnoticed. One possible explanation for the interesting facts about Compositor Y's work is that he was an apprentice. This might easily explain the care taken with sheet B in press correction, and it might possibly explain his unusual, at least in Okes' shop of the time, modern usage of u-v . In fact, external evidence shows that on 15 March 1631 Nicholas Okes did acquire a new apprentice by the name of John Howarden, from Somerset. 1 He was bound for a term of eight years; there is no record as to when he gained his freedom. One can at least speculate that perhaps this new apprentice was the Compositor Y of the 1631 pamphlet describing Heywood's pageant. It is certainly not impossible for an apprentice who joined the firm in March to be setting type by late October or early November, the probable time for the printing of the Heywood quarto. Professor Charlton Hinman in his monumental work on the printing of Shakespeare's First Folio has suggested that the Compositor E whom he identifies was very likely an apprentice, "apparently the first apprentice taken on by Jaggard in something over eight years, . . . a certain John Leason, the son of a Hampshire yeoman. Leason was bound on 4 November 1622, approximately five months before Compositor E began setting type for the First Folio." 2 For whatever the reason, two compositors were used in setting the type for Heywood's 1631 pageant, Londons Ius Honorarium , despite the brevity of the quarto (two compositors do not seem to have been used in the printing of the other Heywood pageants). Whether one of the compositors was an apprentice named Howarden must remain reasonable conjecture, no matter how fascinating.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Aphra Behn's First Biography by Robert Adams Day</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Accounts of Mrs. Aphra Behn have been appearing in print for nearly three hundred years, but a life that would meet the standards of modern scholarship is yet to be written. So scanty is reliable information concerning "the incomparable Astrea" that her biographers may be pardoned for having used every record they could find — whether fact, fiction, or with the two inextricably mixed. The most important single "document" available to them is the "Life and Memoirs . . . by One of the Fair Sex" which was prefixed to the early editions of her collected fiction. It was written shortly after her death; it was accepted as more or less accurate biography until the twentieth century; and before the recent publication of Mrs. Behn's authentic letters from Flanders 1 there was no other substantial body of material to work from. Yet the "Life and Memoirs" has not been made to yield as much as it might. While modern scholars have cast varying degrees of doubt from slight to total on its reliability, they are generally agreed that the fictional element in it is sizable, that Charles Gildon, sometimes called "Mrs. Behn's literary executor," had a good deal to do with the piece, and that romanticized autobiographical material, whether from Aphra Behn's lips or her pen, is probably present. 2 Yet their analyses have all rested on two basic though unstated assumptions: that Gildon, who wrote the dedicatory epistle to Mrs. Behn's collected Histories and Novels , no doubt wrote or at least compiled and set down on paper the "Life and Memoirs," a continuous biographical account, at one sitting, so to speak, and that it first appeared in the earliest or 1696 edition of the Histories and Novels , being transmitted to subsequent editions unchanged except for the correction of punctuation, spelling, and typographical errors. 3 The first assumption does not fit the facts; the second is not true. They have been made because the early editions of the Histories and Novels have never been carefully examined, doubtless because of their rarity, while Mrs. Behn's major biographers, though using various editions, have read the "Life and Memoirs" in a corrected final version which first appeared in 1705, and which differs considerably from earlier ones. 4 A study of internal evidence — the contents of the early texts compared — and of external evidence — the chronology of other information in print on Mrs. Behn — produces a very different account of the authorship and composition of her first biography. Three distinct versions of the "Life and Memoirs" are identifiable. For the sake of brevity I shall designate these and the texts I have examined by symbols as follows: LA— the first version, appearing in the two issues of the 1696 edition of the Histories and Novels (Wing B1711), occupying eighteen unnumbered pages (sigs. A7-b7 v ). I have used the Yale copy, "Printed for S. Briscoe . . . and Sold by Richard Wellington," checked against the Yale, Bodleian, and British Museum copies of the issue with Briscoe's name only. LB— the enlarged version (pp. 1-60) in the two issues of the 1698 "Third Edition with large Additions. Printed for Samuel Briscoe" (Wing B1712). The Yale copy is identical (except for Wellington's name on the title-page) with the Yale and Bodleian copies of the issue printed for Briscoe and Wellington. Its text of the "Life and Memoirs" is also that of the reset fourth edition (pp. i-lvi) in issues of 1699 (University of Texas copy; Wing B1713) and 1700 (William Andrews Clark Memorial Library copy; Wing B1714) printed for Wellington and sold by R. Tuckyr. The title-pages of these copies are identical except for the date, as are their signatures and pagination. LC— the version (pp. 1-51) in the fifth edition of 1705, printed for Richard Wellington, unchanged in subsequent editions. It corrects spelling, contractions, and minor slips in LB. I have used the British Museum copy, checked for content against the Yale copy and later editions. 5 Before examining the differences in the three texts, we must consider a characteristic of LC, the version hitherto used by Mrs. Behn's biographers, that has never before been clearly seen: it is extremely uneven in texture. LC consists of fifty-eight paragraphs, if we allow the heroine's "Love Letters to a Gentleman" and the letters from her Dutch and English suitors to consist of a single paragraph each. On the basis of mode of narration, style, diction, imagery, and point of view, it is readily divisible into nine distinct units: I. (paragraphs 1-5, pp. 1-4) The biographer, with frequent reference to herself as "I" and to her own opinions, takes "Astrea" (Mrs. Behn's designation throughout) from birth to her activities in Antwerp, mentioning her Surinam voyage, return to England, and marriage to Mr. Behn; at Antwerp Astrea turned the passions of a Dutch merchant to the service of her king. Both Oroonoko and The Fair Jilt are mentioned (pp. 2, 4); we learn that further details await us if we read them, and the further mention of "this Reprinting her incomparable Novels" (p. 1) adds to the reader's suspicion that advertising is one of the biographer's motivations here. Nearly all the factual assertions are derivable directly or by inference from these two novels. 6 The biographer, if closely acquainted with Mrs. Behn — "My intimate Acquaintance with the admirable Astrea , gave me, naturally, a very great esteem for her. . . . For my part, I knew her intimately" (pp. 1, 51) — is strangely reticent about her early life, and specific where the novels are specific. Astrea's schooling (considerable, from the evidence of her works), her married life, the fate of Mr. Behn, her introduction at court, are not to be found. The style is clumsy, full of danglers, sentence fragments, vague antecedents, sudden breaks; there are gushy, "feminine" outbursts, with long digressions on Astrea's charms of body and mind and denials that she had an intrigue (mentioned nowhere else) with Oroonoko (pp. 2-3). II. (paragraphs 6-12, pp. 5-8) At Antwerp, in the "latter end of the Year 1666" Astrea is warned as proof of his devotion by Vander Albert, who "in her Husband's time, had been in love with her in England," that the Dutch are planning to invade the Thames and sink English ships. She informs London; her dispatches are bandied about and laughed at; she sees the disaster she had warned of come to pass. In this section "I" is used only once (in the middle of paragraph 8, p. 6), the style is nearly free of the illiteracies of Part I, suggesting a practised hand; the sentences are balanced; the writer does not gush and has a wry sense of humor. The texture is uniform throughout in density of detail, transitions from topic to topic are smooth, and there is a scene in which Vander Albert speaks. As well as a notably slower narrative pace in this part, there is a sharp break in continuity: paragraph 6 is a leisurely description of the effects of love in Dutchmen and of Vander Albert, amounting to a repetition of the sketchy material in paragraph 5. This section is clearly unified, different from Part I as prose yet overlapping it in content. III. (paragraphs 13-20, pp. 8-13) In a narrative letter to "My Dear Friend," Astrea, after a few bitter reflections on her unjust treatment, neatly tells the tale of how Don Miguel and Don Lopez tricked their father the miser Ramirez (perhaps she reflected that Antwerp was in the Spanish Netherlands) into giving up his hoard so that they might marry. The story is a typical novella in the line of descent from Bandello; it might equally be a scenario for a comedy on this threadbare seventeenth-century theme, or one of Mrs. Behn's shorter novels with the conventional epistolary framework tacked on. The style is spare and spry, but sentimental and superfluous comment on love (pp. 9-10) marks its author as possibly a woman. The manner is not untypical of Mrs. Behn's prose in general: Your Remarks upon my politick Capacity, tho' they are sharp, touch me not, but recoil on those that have not made use of the Advantages they might have drawn from thence, and are doubly to blame. First in sending a Person, in whose Ability, Sense, and Veracity, they cou'd not confide; and next, not to understand when a Person indifferent tells 'em a probable Story, and which if it come to pass, wou'd sufficiently punish their Incredulity; and which, if followed, wou'd have put 'em on their Guard against a vigilant and industrious Foe, who watch'd e'ery Opportunity of returning the several Repulses, and Damages they had met with of late from them. (p. 8) The modulation later on from the first person to the third and back is handled smoothly; the whole section suggests a competent storyteller. IV. (paragraphs 21-28, pp. 14-25) In a second letter to "Dear Friend" Astrea relates the ridiculous courtship of Van Bruin, a fat and conceited old Dutchman. The covering letter, though it has one or two "personal" reflections, is merely a setting for displaying four inserted letters — two clumsy imitations by Van Bruin of the manner of the fashionable French épistoliers , with two witty replies in which Astrea parodies his efforts, the entire courtship being conducted in the conventional though incongruous imagery of a naval battle. The whole section is a typical specimen of a fictional cliché of Mrs. Behn's era, the brief epistolary narrative with "characteristic" letters. Astrea's personal reflections are in the same style as in Part III; the biographer does not appear. V. (paragraphs 29-31, pp. 25-27) Although Part IV has just ended with a scene involving Vander Albert (p. 24), this begins, "But now 'tis time to proceed to her Affairs, with Vander Albert , her other Dutch Lover. . . ." Two brief intrigue-stories are narrated almost in the manner of synopses. Albert is tricked into bedding with his deserted wife Catalina, thinking her to be Astrea; then an elderly female companion of Astrea's conveys him into our heroine's bed, but the stratagem is exploded. The biographer does not appear distinctly as narrator. The style is smooth and clear, the syntax never confused despite the extremely condensed narration. The two bed-tricks, one with the well-worn theme of All's Well That Ends Well , again suggest stage scenarios; the narration again is that of the Bandellian anecdote, compressed yet lively. VI. (paragraph 32, pp. 27-28) Vander Albert dies suddenly "at Amsterdam of a Fever." Astrea returns to England "with Sir Bernard Gascoign , and others," the party sees the strange apparition of a floating pavilion at sea; a storm, shipwreck, and rescue follow. Sentence fragments, feminine flutters — in the description of the pavilion — and incoherence return to the style. The biographer says, "I have often heard [Astrea] assert, that the whole Company saw [the vision]." VII. (paragraphs 33-47, pp. 28-38) This part is a lengthy tale, chiefly in the third person, of the complicated amatory misadventures of a foolish fop who eventually comes to plague Astrea with ridiculously affected letters, of which we see a specimen. The narrator undertakes to rid her of him, and is lustfully embraced at a tete-a-tete; some gentlemen break in by prearrangement and toss him in a blanket. The fop's early history (pp. 29-34) is given as from Astrea's lips, but the account is not made to resemble speech; it has the typical "portraits" and reflections on character which the Restoration novel copied from French romans and nouvelles . The style, figures of speech, and use of detail are uniform, but in no way resemble parts I and VI, or Van Bruin's letters; the narrative mode is that of the "sons of Ramirez" story. Though the tale is technically told by the biographer, "she" serves as a mere frame-device, and scarcely appears. VIII. (paragraphs 48-57, pp. 38-50) "I have already mention'd Lysander , as a Lover she valu'd [Astrea has, in paragraph 45] . . . she having contributed her letters to him, to the last Impression . . . those . . . I have now inserted in their order." Then follow, with a separate heading, the eight "Love-Letters to a Gentleman. By Mrs. A. Behn. Printed from the Original Letters ." It is true that these letters bear some resemblance to the famous Lettres portugaises , but they also have characteristics (frequent, clearly unstudied incoherence, abrupt changes of tone, unexplained specific references to times, places, and names) that the fictional letters of the period never have; there is thus good reason to believe them genuine. The subject's letters surely have a place in a biography, but the biographer speaks of Mrs. Behn's lover as Lysander, while all the letters except the first, which uses no name, are addressed to "Lycidas." IX. (paragraphs 57-58, pp. 50-51) "Here I must draw to an end." The biographer vaguely mentions "considerable Trusts" reposed in Astrea, gives a vaguer account of her death and burial, and closes with a paragraph of eulogy: she surpassed the "Canting Tribe of Dissemblers." The style again resembles Part I, with loose sentences and shaky syntax. This synopsis should demonstrate that LC is by no means a single connected document or the work of a single writer. The division into nine sections is perhaps debatable, but LC plainly contains at least four levels of style — the stumbling, semi-literate looseness of the "biographer's" passages; the vigorous, somewhat rhetorical, but idiomatic and uneven style of the "Love-Letters;" the hyperbolic flights of the parody letters; and the crisp, balanced, competent prose of Parts II-V, VII, and VIII. Moreover, fifty of the fifty-eight paragraphs bear far less resemblance to biography than to various popular forms of short fiction, varieties all to be found in Mrs. Behn's published prose works. 7 The fictional passages, unified in style, are also unbroken in texture. While a versatile writer could have assumed such a variety of styles in writing the life of Mrs. Behn, who would have taken the trouble, and why? We must conclude that LC is a patchwork, and try to determine the order of appearance of its parts, their origin, and their authorship. The early editions of Mrs. Behn's fiction have never been described in print; and the facts of their publication and contents must be recapitulated here. We should remember that only three of these brief novels were published in her lifetime, and no second editions were called for. Oroonoko , The Fair Jilt , and Agnes de Castro appeared in 1688, all published by Will. Canning; and it was doubtless a desire to get rid of unsold copies that made him issue them bound together in the same year as Three Histories . 8 (Though The History of the Nun and The Lucky Mistake are dated 1689, Mrs. Behn wrote dedications for both, and so must have managed to sell them before her death; the former bears a license granted October 22, 1688.) Her novels received no further attention for several years. In November, 1695, however, Thomas Southerne's Oroonoko was produced with great success, and it is thought that the play's fame induced the booksellers to try the profits of a revival of the novels. 9 Richard Wellington's advertisement of the Histories and Novels appears in the Term Catalogues for May, 1696, and two issues of the first edition are dated in that year. Samuel Briscoe, though he did not advertise, seems to have been the proprietor of copy, since both issues are "Printed for S. Briscoe." The Wellington issue, which adds "and Sold by Richard Wellington," is otherwise identical except that it has an engraving of Mrs. Behn after the portrait by Riley, facing the title-page; and the sales arrangement was evidently amicable, since early in 1697 Briscoe was advertising Wellington's playbooks together with the Histories and Novels "with her Picture." 10 The 1696 Histories and Novels seems to have been put together in haste, with Oroonoko dominating the production plans. Discrepancies in pagination and signatures suggest that several different printers worked simultaneously on the copy. 11 There is no dedication to the volume as a whole, its place being taken by Mrs. Behn's original dedication of Oroonoko to Lord Maitland, and since Agnes de Castro and The Fair Jilt also appear with their original dedications we may conjecture that the volume was set up in type directly and unimaginatively from copies of the first editions. The "novels" had all appeared in print before; besides the three mentioned there are only The Lover's Watch and The Lady's Looking-Glass (translations from the French which had appeared in 1685), and The Lucky Mistake (1689). For our purposes, however, the most interesting item is the life — LA. This comes between the dedication of Oroonoko and the novel itself, is unpaged, and surprisingly takes up only eighteen pages in large italic type (sigs. A7-b7 v ) as against the fifty-one in smaller type of the life printed in 1705 — LC. Part of the discrepancy is accounted for by the fact that the eight "Love-Letters to a Gentleman," in "their proper place" on pp. 38-50 of LC, appear without prefatory material at the end of the 1696 volume. (They are described as "Never before Printed" on the book's title-page.) LA offers further surprises. Whereas LC is headed "The History of the Life and Memoirs of Mrs. Behn. Written by one of the Fair Sex," LA reads, "Memoirs on the Life of Mrs. Behn . Written by a Gentlewoman of her Acquaintance." The first seven paragraphs are identical in wording with the same material in LC, as is the first sentence of the eighth, ending with "she [Astrea] put him [Vander Albert] to that use, which made her very serviceable to the King." But instead of going on with the story of the Dutch Thames plot, LA proceeds, "The Particulars of which, are not proper to insert in this Essay; I shall only proceed to the Conclusion of her Affair with the Dutch -Man, which was pleasant enough, and by which means she might preserve her Honour, without injuring her Gratitude. . . ." (sigs. b3 v -b4). This passage may be compared with paragraph 29 of LC (p. 25), which begins "But now 'tis time to proceed to her Affairs, with Vander Albert , her other Dutch Lover, which was pleasant enough, and in which she contriv'd to preserve her Honour, without injuring her Gratitude. . . ."—although Vander Albert has been on stage, so to speak, in paragraph 28. The story goes on from the tale of Catalina to the arrival in England precisely as in paragraphs 29-32 of LC. It continues: The Rest of her Life was entirely dedicated to Pleasure and Poetry; the success in which, gain'd her the Acquaintance and Friendship of the most sensible Men of the Age. Here therefore I must draw to an End. . . . (sig. b6 v ) This represents the first three and one-half lines of paragraph 33 of LC (p. 28) and the first words of paragraph 57 (p. 50), except that "therefore" is omitted in LC. From this point the two accounts of Astrea's end are identical, save for one startling discrepancy. Where LC says (p. 50) "her Death, occasion'd by an unskilful Physician, on the 16 th of April , 1689" (the date on her tombstone, assumed to be correct), LA has "about March or April 1686" (sigs. b6 v -b7). Unless we suppose that the printer inverted the last digit of "1689" the Gentlewoman of Mrs. Behn's Acquaintance who "knew her intimately" was three years off in the date of her death; and even if the error in the year is typographical, the biographer certainly was not hovering about her friend's deathbed. LA, then, is a document of fourteen paragraphs to LC's fifty-eight. It omits the Thames plot, the sons of Ramirez, the Van Bruin courtship, the English fop, and the amour with Lysander/Lycidas and its eight love-letters (though these are at the end of the volume). But when it tallies with LC the correspondence is exact except for errors in spelling and typography and the erroneous death-date, all corrected in LC. Moreover, except for the minor changes in wording already noted, it consists almost exactly of Parts I, II, V, VI, and IX of the stylistic division made above, the principal discrepancy being that the last four and one-half paragraphs of II (the Thames plot) are omitted. I and IX are alike in style and are marked by the presence of the "biographer," while II, which repeats material in I, and V-VI are in a different style and suggest fiction. The 1696 Histories and Novels must have sold well. On February 3, 1696/97 The Nun : or , The Fair Vow-Breaker was entered in the Stationers' Register for Samuel Lowndes, evidently to safeguard his right to the copy, and a rare because ineffective procedure by this time; 12 and in November 1697 Wellington advertised "All the Histories and Novels . . . The Third Edition, with Large Additions." This edition appeared, probably in the first half of 1698, 13 in two issues printed for Briscoe as the 1696 edition had, identical except that one adds Wellington's name on the title-page; both now have the facing portrait of Mrs. Behn. Several peculiarities are worth noting. Except for Oroonoko the novels have separate title-pages indicating that they were printed for Briscoe in 1697, and each is separately paged, so that Briscoe may have planned or tried to sell them as separate volumes; or, since the book is divided into four units by typography, 14 four different printers may have worked on it at once. The title-page advertises The History of the LIFE and MEMOIRS of Mrs. BEHN. Never before Printed. By one of the Fair Sex. Intermix'd with Pleasant Love-Letters that pass'd betwixt her and Minheer Van Bruin , a Dutch Merchant; with her Character of the Country and Lover; And her Love-Letters to a Gentleman in England . The epistle dedicatory, signed by Charles Gildon, speaks of "Considerable Additions to her Life" (sig. A5). The additions consist of Parts III, IV, VII, and VIII, so that LB is verbally almost identical with LC. Most of LA's errors in spelling and typography have now been corrected, apparently by the printer, and a few single words added or deleted; but the date of Mrs. Behn's death (p. 59) has not yet been corrected. Since no volume designated as being of a second edition has survived, we may wonder whether the "third" edition of 1698 ought to be called the second. In any case, the fourth edition (in issues of 1699 and 1700) sold by Wellington and R. Tuckyr, is identical in contents with the third just described, though it has been reset, and it lacks the portrait. Most of the novels have title-pages indicating that they were printed for Wellington in 1699. Wellington's fifth edition of 1705, "Corrected from the many Errors of former Impressions," contains the third version of her life — LC, with the text again reset and the date of Mrs. Behn's death finally corrected (p. 50). LC continued to be reprinted by various booksellers as Mrs. Behn's posthumous popularity grew, in 1718, 1722, 1735, 1751, and so on until the 1871 London facsimile, but it retained no traces of its adventures in the hands of Wellington and of Briscoe (who had nothing further to do with this particular collection of novels after 1698). Having established that LA contains only half of the sections in LB/LC and a third of their text, we are in a better position to investigate the derivation of statements in the "Life and Memoirs" to determine their authorship and perhaps their reliability. A useful method is to consider the chronology of published statements about Mrs. Behn. Although she must have had a circle of friends in her last years, no detailed account by anyone whom we can prove to have known her well has survived. Prologues, lampoons, and such topical verse refer to poverty, "a Sciatica," pox, and liaisons with various men; the first two afflictions are confirmed by a letter and a dedication of hers, but the latter accusations may be the distortions of malice. 15 Biographical dictionaries reveal almost nothing. In Edward Phillips' Theatrum Poetarum (1675, p. 255) nothing is said of her life, and she does not appear at all in William Winstanley's Lives of the Most Famous English Poets (1687). The careful Gerard Langbaine, writing only two years after her death, seems to have thought that her name was Astrea, and his one piece of specific information — that she wrote for bread — came from the preface to Sir Patient Fancy . It is probable that his knowledge of Mrs. Behn was derived entirely from her books. 16 The dedication to her posthumous The Widdow-Ranter by her "known friend" George Jenkins gives no facts; that of Southerne's Oroonoko (sig. A2 v ) in effect disavows a close relationship with her: "I remember what I have heard from a Friend of hers, that she always told [Oroonoko's] Story, more feelingly, than she writ it." More significantly, Gildon's Miscellany Poems Upon Several Occasions (1692) and Chorus Poetarum (1694) which print four new poems of hers, and his Miscellaneous Letters and Essays (1694), consisting partly of letters to ladies on subjects of feminine interest, say nothing whatever of her life. Thus from Mrs. Behn's death until 1696 nothing about her which a biographer could use had appeared in print. Specific statements were forthcoming in LA, and in another work of the same year, "An Account of the Life of the Incomparable Mrs. Aphra Behn," prefixed to her posthumous play The Younger Brother , which Gildon prepared for the stage and the press. This document has not been studied in detail, but its contents are important in determining Gildon's relationship to the "Life and Memoirs" in any or all of its stages of growth. As nearly as we can tell, Gildon wrote his "Account" at about the same time as the appearance of LA, or more probably afterwards. 17 Gildon does not sign the "Account" as he does the play's dedication, but the concluding remarks (sig. A5) about the brutal treatment The Younger Brother met with on its first night are enough to identify him, for no one else had occasion to care about the play's fate. Since Gildon troubles to write a life at all, and since he supposes that "a short Account of her Life will be a very grateful present to the Ingenious" (sig. A4), we may assume that he is going to tell us all he knows that is of interest; it is remarkable that in a biography taking up two and one-half quarto pages he tells us so little. If facts are separated from flummery, Gildon's biography yields the following statements; and if these are checked against LA, Oroonoko (which was in the 1696 volume), and Mrs. Behn's own letters, we reach interesting conclusions. 1. The lady's maiden name (her first name is not once mentioned) was Johnson; her father was a gentleman of a good family in Canterbury, where she spent her childhood, a precocious poetic genius. [This information is in LA (sigs. A7 v -A8).] 2. She went to Surinam with her father, mother, brother, and sisters, while "very Young." [This is in LA ( ibid. ) which mentions only "Children;" but Oroonoko mentions her mother, brother, and a sister (pp. 184, 185, 208).] 3. In Surinam she "lost" her "Relations and Friends," and was "oblig'd" to return to England. [Both LA and Oroonoko kill off her father and his patron; but her letters from Flanders prove that her mother and brother were alive in 1666. 18 ] 4. She then married Mr. Behn, "an Eminent Merchant." [This is in LA (sig. b v ), though Gildon supplies "Eminent."] 5. Her reputation for wit and secrecy caused her to be "employ'd by K. Charles the Second, in several Negotiations in Flauders . . . which she quitted with all the Applause Success cou'd gain a Beautiful Woman. . . . How grateful he [Charles] was, or whether her service made his satisfaction extend to a reward, I have forgot. But to that soft Court we owe her exerting her Poetical Genius. . . ." [This can all be derived from LA (sigs. b v -b3 v ); it is interesting that Gildon's memory fails him just where the thread of LA's narrative breaks. The Thames plot and Astrea's neglect by Whitehall do not appear until LB.] 6. She was a model conversationalist, a woman of wit, judgment, and learning. [Thus LA (sig. b7).] 7. Her last years found her poor, with "a tedious Sickness, and several years . . . Indisposition." [This is correct, and at wide variance with LA's "The Rest of her Life was entirely dedicated to Pleasure and Poetry" (sig. b6 v ).] 8. She died "soon after the Revolution." [Though not precise, Gildon's information is more accurate by three years than LA's misdating.] 9. She is buried "in the Cloysters of Westminster-Abby , under a plain Marble Stone, with two Wretched Verses for her Epitaph." [This reproduces LA almost verbatim (sig. b7); neither Gildon nor LA gives the text of the epitaph.] 10. She wrote with great ease; Gildon saw her write Oroonoko while conversing with several people in the room. [This sounds authentic, and has been cited as evidence of Gildon's close connection with Mrs. Behn, but the end of her dedication of Oroonoko to Lord Maitland, on the page before LA (sig. A6) says, "'Twill be no Commendation to the Book, to assure your Lordship I writ it in a few Hours, though it may serve to Excuse some of its Faults of Connexion; for I never rested my Pen a Moment for Thought. . . ."] 11. Gildon saw several pieces of hers in her own handwriting, among them The Younger Brother . [Gildon had already published four Behn poems for the first time in his two miscellanies.] The evidence Gildon provides in his undisputed life of Mrs. Behn (if we grant that LA was published before it) indicates that he used LA and Oroonoko , but not very carefully, correcting them according to his own knowledge, which was limited entirely to her poverty and illness late in life and the approximate time of her death. A suspicion that he knew nothing independently of her early life is confirmed not only by his account's close correspondence with LA, but by his very vehemence: I must not be particular in all the little Accidents of her Child-hood, for that wou'd be more than my Reader would Pardon, tho most Writers of Lives take care to omit not the least trivial actions of the very infancy of the Persons they wou'd Celebrate. . . . But one motive to that Impertinence I want, Prolixity; for I aim at as short a Relation as possible. (sig. A4) Was Gildon chuckling as he wrote? The alternative explanation is that he composed LA afterwards with the facts somewhat modified, but simultaneously knew and did not know when his intimate friend had died. When he came to revise Langbaine's English Dramatick Poets in 1698, he of course knew a good deal more. He gave Mrs. Behn the maiden name of Johnson and the birthplace of Canterbury, plus beauty in her youth, and stated that she was "employ'd by Charles II in the Discovery of the Dutch Intreagues, in the Dutch War. . . ." He also seems to have visited Westminster Abbey, for he corrects Langbaine's "Astrea" to "Aphara" and prints the "wretched verses" of the epitaph. He shows great solicitude for the unhappy fate of The Younger Brother , which was published "with her life added." 19 It seems certain that Gildon did not pose as a Gentlewoman of Mrs. Behn's Acquaintance and write LA; but could he have written or assembled LB? Gildon was something of a literary mimic, but none of the characteristic letters in his Post-Boy Rob'd of His Mail (1692-93) resemble any of the new material in LB either in style or content. 20 Again, this competent writer, taking pride in his work and overfond (at least in the 1690's) of studding it with classical allusions and sententiae, is an odd candidate for the authorship of Parts II, III, IV, and VII. Why would he write in such a variety of styles and modes, weaving unrelated materials into four short stories in only the first of which Astrea figures prominently? And why, since he advertised his "Account" in his revision of Langbaine, did he not mention this longer and more spectacular "life" if it were his? Gildon had the abilities to supply the new parts in LB, but it is hard to see how he could have done so. On the other hand, if it was Gildon who merely fitted the new parts into LA, he was not earning his money. In the epistle dedicatory which precedes LB Gildon includes his favorite (or only) anecdotes — Mrs. Behn's poverty and his seeing her write Oroonoko (sig. A4 v ) — although they would have been valuable additions to the "Life and Memoirs;" and the overlappings and discrepancies we have noted above indicate that whoever fitted the new material into LA to make LB did his work with the absolute minimum of care and thought. It is more charitable to conclude that Gildon's sole contribution to the 1698 Histories and Novels (he was also compiling a miscellany of letters for Briscoe at the time) 21 was a suitably literate epistle dedicatory, bristling with Latin tags (eight) and references to the poets and patrons of antiquity (fourteen). If Gildon had nothing to do with the "Life and Memoirs," who wrote LA? If we dismiss parts II, V, and VI as clearly fictional, resembling many Restoration "novels," we are left with Parts I and IX, semi-literate in style and with the "biographer" clearly present, forming a single memoir of eight paragraphs consistent in texture and unbroken in content. Its early part is relatively circumstantial and adds several details to what can be derived from Oroonoko , suggesting the possibility of an oral source; 22 its latter part is extremely vague and inaccurate. At three points (sigs. b2, b3 v , b6 v ) the "biographer" regrets that "she" must suppress or cannot "insert" material on Astrea's secret service in Antwerp — precisely what is found in Part II, which agrees in style and manner with the Catalina-old-woman-pavilion stories that did appear in LA. The "insertion" of these (but not of Part II) would account for the preponderance of Antwerp adventures and fiction in the oddly-proportioned LA, part of a volume which also printed the "Love-Letters" for the first time. The only theory to account fully for the creation of LA-LC is this: a flimsy and brief account of Mrs. Behn, perhaps by a woman who had been acquainted with or heard tales of her, was expanded by its author or the bookseller, using two separate caches of papers which came to light in 1695/6 and 1697/8. The first contained the "Love-Letters" and Parts II, V, and VI; the second included the much longer and more artistically developed III, IV, and VII, together with the three short anecdotal novels which first appeared in the 1698 edition — The Nun , The Black Lady , and The King of Bantam . Parts II-VII were in all likelihood semi-autobiographical fictional sketches by Mrs. Behn herself. It is not at all improbable that two separate collections of Behn manuscripts should have turned up in this manner. New plays, poems, and letters attributed to her appeared irregularly from 1690 to 1718, usually with good internal evidence or the printers' vouchers for their authenticity, as her posthumous fame grew and her plays and novels were reprinted for a wider public. 23 The success of the 1696 Histories and Novels would have induced Briscoe and Wellington to search out and pay for unpublished Behn works. (Briscoe published five of her novels for the first time in 1698-1700.) 24 Furthermore, it is probable that between 1682, when her profitable writing for the stage ceased almost entirely, for whatever cause, 25 and her death, Mrs. Behn wrote a good deal of short fiction which remained unpublished; at least two of her posthumous novels refer to Charles II as living. 26 The publishing history of the "Life and Memoirs" makes it apparent that presuppositions which we would bring to a formal biography of the period are largely irrelevant to such an account, aimed at advertising and entertainment, produced for an audience which would not quibble at the dividing line between fact and fiction, and designed to insinuate the reader pleasantly into the collection of novels while diverting him with amorous adventures and clearing the authoress' reputation. Yet whatever the value of the "Life and Memoirs," so little material is available for a biographer of Aphra Behn that he has a particular responsibility for careful scrutiny and use of what there is, even if the result is only "to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time." While our investigation does not dispel the obscurity surrounding much of Mrs. Behn's life, it sheds light on the sources, nature, and reliability of her first biography. We may conclude that Charles Gildon cannot be proved to have had anything to do with its composition. Whoever put together the 1696 text of the "Life and Memoirs," whether One of the Fair Sex, Briscoe, Wellington, or John Doe, knew almost nothing about Mrs. Behn that was not already in print. Nearly all of the "Life and Memoirs" consists of novels and fragments of novels, very probably by Mrs. Behn, and some of her letters. Most of its specific statements which are not part of these fictions are derived from her published works, and perhaps (in one or two cases) from her own lips. Aphra Behn's first biographer was the incomparable Astrea herself.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Text of Scott's Edition of Swift by Lee H. Potter</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On July 25, 1808, Walter Scott settled with Archibald Constable, the Edinburgh bookseller and publisher, to make a new edition of Jonathan Swift's works. Scott was to receive fifteen hundred pounds; the edition was to be published in two years. 1 Six years passed before it was finished. 2 During these years, although he had gone to work enthusiastically, Scott found the project an enormous and an irritating burden. He quarreled with his publisher's partner, found it necessary to change printers, and — most tiresome — became involved with a group of literary hangers-on who absorbed endless amounts of his time and energy. Not quite four months after he had undertaken the edition he wrote to John Murray, "I now heartily wish it had never commenced" ( Letters , II, 125). By 1813 he could speak of it to M. W. Hartstonge as "a most Herculean task" (III, 261). A year later he wrote with evident relief to the Marchioness of Abercorn, "Swift who rode me like Sinbad's old man of the sea for so many years is now sent to his fate . . . . It will be the last of my editorial labours[;] that I am determined upon" (III, 521). Meanwhile, Constable had become fretful over the delay. He had been much aggrieved in 1810 that he could not market the edition immediately after the huge success of The Lady of the Lake , at which time, he said, he could have got rid of anything with Scott's name attached (III, 461, n.1). And when at last, four years later, the edition was ready to appear, Constable's partner, Cadell, was annoyed, too, although for a different reason: "[Scott] just appears to have cast it from him like as much dross he longed to be quit of . . . ." 3 As we shall see, Cadell's stricture, at least insofar as Scott's text is concerned, was a sound one. In the British Museum are preserved sizeable portions of two volumes of an octavo edition of Swift's works. The title pages of these volumes, the original covers, and large sections of the texts of each have been removed. The remainders have been rebound under a single cover. The British Museum General Catalogue refers to them as follows: "Epistolary Correspondence. [Pp. 261-459 and 1-280 of two volumes of an edition of Swift's works, used by Sir Walter Scott for his edition of Swift, with copious MS. Notes by Sir Walter Scott.] [ London , 1805?] 8°." 4 It will be noted that the Catalogue entry does not identify the edition to which these partial volumes belonged. By comparing them, however, to corresponding volumes in the octavo editions which preceded Scott's, one can show that they once were parts of volumes XI and XII of a set of John Nichols' third edition of Swift's works, published in 1808. 5 Furthermore, the cataloguer did not see, or did not think it worth remarking, that the manuscript notations on the pages are in two hands — Scott's and another person's — a fact of considerable importance in establishing the very close relationship between the British Museum copies of Nichols XI and XII and Scott's finished edition. The British Museum volumes are in fact the printer's copy from which a compositor set up the type for volume XVII of Scott's edition. A study of the notations on their pages clearly proves this and enables us to make a sound evaluation of Scott's text as well as to describe with some precision the manner in which he went about putting it together. The notations in Scott's hand are of two types: (1) those indicating alterations of one sort or another in the text or in the notes of Nichols' edition, and (2) those bearing directly upon the order in which Scott's volume XVII was to be made up. Of the latter type there are relatively few. On page 261 of Nichols XI (the first page of the British Museum copy), immediately above the running title "Epistolary Correspondence," Scott wrote the words "Bastard Title/Letters/From January 1724-5 to January 1731." At Nichols XII, 1, again just above the running title (which this time is marked for deletion with a single horizontal line), he wrote, "Continuation of copy for XVII Vol. Swift." Again, at the end of the last complete letter in Nichols XII, he wrote, "Conclusion Vol. XVII." Such notations as these were perhaps a convenience for Scott — they would have provided him a simple means of keeping his bearings while arranging the pages of his volume. But it is clear that they were intended, too, for the printer, for if one turns to the seventeenth volume of Scott's edition he will see that all three of the directions noted above were carefully observed. The words "Bastard Title" do not, of course, appear on the first page of Scott XVII, but the remainder of the notation — that is, the title itself — is printed, except for one change in capitalization, just as Scott wrote it. 6 Furthermore, the first of Swift's letters in Nichols XII follows immediately, in Scott XVII, upon the last letter of Nichols XI (as Scott had directed), and where at the end of Nichols XII Scott had written "Conclusion Vol. XVII," there, when it came from the press, volume XVII ended. The remaining notations in Scott's hand — considerably more numerous than those of the type just discussed — call for alterations in the text or the notes of the Nichols edition. But the most cursory glance at the British Museum volumes will show that it was the notes in which Scott was principally interested (Nichols' text is left almost completely untouched). In adapting them to his own purposes he was remarkedly energetic; Nichols' margins are often filled with his alterations. And to make these alterations clear to the compositor Scott employed a variety of marks, some of them conventional proofreader's symbols, others more or less makeshift devices suited to his immediate needs. When, for instance, he wished to delete only the initial or name with which, frequently, notes in the Nichols edition were signed, he would simply strike through it a slanted, vertical, or horizontal line. The note was then retained, intact and unsigned, in his own volume. At Nichols XI, 410, for example, we find the following printed note: "Mr. Pope, the Dean being at Twickenham. N." Through Nichols' initial is drawn a small, slanting line, and at Scott XVII, 151, the note appears, as Scott wished it to appear, without the initial. The note seems, of course, to be Scott's own. Horizontal or vertical lines are sometimes struck through entire notes (as, for instance, they are at Nichols XI, 368 and XII, 62); and where such deletions are indicated there is usually a mark in the margin, by the side of the note to be deleted, so prominent that it could hardly fail to catch the compositor's eye. Occasionally Scott replaced these notes with his own. Just as often, however, instead of deleting entire notes he simply rephrased what Nichols had already printed. At Nichols XI, 323, one finds typical instances of this practice. The original notes read as follows: *Thomas Medlicott, esq. representative in parliament for Westminster, and a commissioner of the revenue in Ireland. N. τTo sing in his cathedral at Dublin. N. Through the words "representative in parliament" in the first note Scott drew a horizontal line and just below the word "parliament" inserted a caret. In the right margin, slightly above the note, he wrote the word "Member." Through "To sing in" and "at Dublin" in the second note he again drew a line, writing the word "For" in the margin to the left and "choir" in the margin to the right. The initial "N" is marked for deletion in both cases. At Scott XVII, 67, the notes appear in their new dress with two changes in capitalization and one in spelling: *Thomas Medlycott, Esq. member for Westminster, and a commissioner of the revenue in Ireland. τFor his cathedral choir. Whether or not one feels that the revised version is superior to the original, it should be evident from these examples that what appears in Scott's edition to be Scott's work is not always his work at all. At several points in Nichols' margins Scott wrote the abbreviation "P.A." ("page [or 'paper'] apart") to make sure that the compositor would include the notes which because of their length Scott had written on separate pieces of paper and pasted in the Nichols volumes, indicating the desired place of insertion with an asterisk or a cross. Occasionally he expanded this abbreviation, as he did, for example, when he inserted in Nichols XII (between pages 136 and 137) a transcript of a previously unpublished letter from Swift to the Reverend John Blachford dated April 16, 1731. 7 On page 136, just above the heading of Swift's letter to Lady Worsley dated April 19, 1730, Scott wrote "take in letter on p. apart." The "p. apart," of course, was Hartstonge's transcript, which was printed accordingly in Scott XVII immediately before the letter to Lady Worsley. Carelessly, Scott misplaced the letter by one year. Only a few times in these volumes did Scott turn his attention to the text itself. A typographical error might catch his eye, as one did at Nichols XI, 385, where he corrected an inverted spelling (French "nom" to "mon") by scratching out the misspelled word and writing its correct form in the margin. At another point (XI, 350) he called for Roman type to replace italic with the usual proofreader's abbreviation "Rom." But there is no evidence that any concern for an accurate, authoritative text of these letters drove him to greater exertions than this. Few pages in the Nichols volumes are free of marginal notations in Scott's hand, most of them calling for changes in Nichols' notes. A comparison of the changes indicated with the accomplished changes in Scott XVII leaves little room for doubt that these notations were directions to the compositor. To prove conclusively that these volumes are actual printer's copy, I turn now to the marginal notations in a second hand in the Nichols volumes. These notations first appear at Nichols XI, 273, and continue at intervals of sixteen to eighteen pages throughout the remainder of the two partial volumes. Each of them is similar to the others, and each has the same purpose. The one that occurs at Nichols XII, 232, part way through Swift's letter of July 24, 1731, to the Countess of Suffolk, is typical. "I am contented," writes Swift, "that the queen should see this letter; and would please to consider how severe a censure it is to believe I should write three to her, only to find fault with her ministry, and recommend Mrs. Barber: whom I never knew until she was recommended to me by a worthy friend, to help her to subscribers, which by her writings I thought she deserved." In the margin of Nichols XII, 232, to the left of the text quoted here and approximately even with the line in which the word "ministry" appears, is the penciled notation, on two lines, "Vol. 17 / Dd 417." The notation is scrawled in a large, rather crude hand. Around the first two syllables of the word "ministry" has been drawn an elongated bracket. If one turns to page 417 of Scott XVII, he will find there a signature corresponding to that in the notation, and he will further find that the word "ministry" is the first word on the page. It is the same with each of these notations, each of them consisting of a volume number, a signature, and a page reference. When one checks the rest of Scott XVII against Nichols XI and XII, one discovers that the pattern is perfectly consistent. The notations in the Nichols volumes unfailingly specify the signature, the first word of each sheet (bracketed by the compositor), and the number of the first page of each sheet. As a group, these notations indicate merely that the compositor had a simple and efficient way of keeping track of his place in the text. Having finished setting in type the sixteen octavo pages of a given sheet, he drew an open bracket in the copy around the word with which the next sheet was to begin, noting, too, in the margin, the signature of the next sheet and the number of its first page. After another sixteen to eighteen pages (this variation being explained largely by the occasionally greater number and length of Scott's notes) he would repeat the operation, and so on throughout the copy. In this way he helped guard against error and at the same time made it unnecessary to refer to the formes of a finished sheet, which would have been stored or laid in a press. As evidence that the British Museum copies of Nichols XI and XII are in fact the copy from which one or more compositors set up the type for Scott XVII, these notations are conclusive. Scott used other volumes of Nichols' edition in the same way. In the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library are preserved "Two volumes of excerpts from an edition of Swift's works (p. 281-463 of v. XII, p. 1-308 of v. XIII; p. 397-456 of v. VII, p. 3-470 of v. VIII and miscellaneous pages) rearranged and annotated by Sir Walter Scott for v. 7 and 18 of his 1814 edition of Swift's Works." 8 In all respects — pagination, notes, signatures, and text — these partial volumes agree with corresponding portions of Nichols' 1808 edition. In all probability they belong to the same set of which the British Museum volumes were a part. Clearly the portion of volume XII (pp. 281-463) in the Berg Collection is the latter half of the volume XII (pp. 1-280) in the British Museum. And it is clear, too, that these partial volumes are compositor's copy; their pages display precisely the same kinds of annotations, in Scott's hand and the compositor's, that one finds in the British Museum volumes. Furthermore, an examination of the copy for Scott VII reveals that it is even more a composite than the catalogue entry suggests: in addition to the portions from Nichols VII and VIII cited in the entry, one finds, among the "miscellaneous pages," ten short prose tracts from Nichols IX, 9 one letter from the British Museum portion of Nichols XII, 10 and five short tracts, interestingly enough, from volumes IX and XIII of Nichols' 1801 edition. 11 Nothing illustrates more exactly Scott's approach to the editing of Swift than does the copy for volume VII. For here Scott has combined, in one volume of his own, portions of six volumes of Nichols' two octavo editions — the 1801 (first) edition and the 1808 (third) edition, which is largely a reprint of the first. Here also Scott's dependence upon Nichols' text is no less great and his manipulation of Nichols' notes no less unseemly than we may feel it to have been in the copy for volume XVII. Nothing in the method has changed. Nichols' 1801 text is the only new thing, but its appearance gives rise to two important questions. One must ask in the first place how extensively Scott used the 1801 edition. His text of the Journal to Stella , for example, seems clearly to have been taken from it: all variants appearing in a collation of Scott's text with Nichols' 1808 text disappear in further collation with the 1801 text. 12 One must ask, secondly, why Scott used the 1801 edition at all rather than rely entirely upon the more complete, more fully annotated 1808 edition. His cheerful appropriation of Nichols' notes in the copy for volume XVII makes it seem strange, at any point, that he should leave the richer field for the poorer. The first of these questions involves, of course, the larger consideration of Scott's indebtedness to both of Nichols' editions. It is clear that Scott had at his disposal all of the volumes of the 1808 edition; whether he had all of the 1801 edition we cannot tell with certainty. But because there is good reason to believe that he did and no evidence to indicate that he did not, 13 we may proceed on the reasonable assumption that he did. It is an assumption, however, which complicates at many points the problem of ascertaining which of the two editions Scott used as copy-text, for the 1808 edition being largely a reprint of the 1801 edition, Scott's text is frequently identical to that of both. We must ask, in such instances, how we are to know which of these editions Scott annotated and then sent to the printer. Fortunately there is additional evidence, albeit entirely presumptive, which makes it possible to answer this question with relative certainty. This evidence derives from an examination of the critical apparatus of the three editions under consideration. One notices immediately, in comparing Nichols' editions, that few of the notes in the 1801 edition are signed and that few in the 1808 edition are unsigned, Nichols having provided initials which identify the original authors of most of them. Thus, frequently, the only difference between corresponding notes in the editions is the added initial in the later edition. Now the extant volumes of compositor's copy of Scott's edition — the annotated volumes in the British Museum and in the New York Public Library — show that many times Scott marked for deletion only the initial with which a note was signed, leaving the rest of the note to be reprinted. The result of this practice was that in Scott's edition there are notes which we know to have been taken from Nichols 1808 but which because they are unsigned appear to have come from Nichols 1801. Conversely, there are notes in Scott's edition which because they are signed are identical with notes in Nichols 1808 but which may have been taken from Nichols 1801, in which some notes were also signed. It happens, therefore, that at certain points Scott's text of Swift agrees with the texts of both Nichols editions but that his notes agree, in being signed, only with those of Nichols 1808. In such cases one must ask, then, whether Scott copied the signatures of the notes into Nichols 1801, following the attributions in Nichols 1808, or whether he used Nichols 1808, retaining signatures where it pleased him to do so. This, it will be remembered, is what he did in the compositor's copy which has come down to us, and it seems improbable that he would have departed from such a simple and, for his purposes, satisfactory procedure. To assume that he used the 1801 edition and transcribed signatures would be to assume, in view of the many notes which he had to account for, that he made for himself a great deal of unnecessary labor. All things considered, in a situation of textual agreement such as the one described here, the presence in Scott's edition of a signed note identical except for the signature to a note in both of Nichols' editions constitutes good presumptive evidence that Scott was using the 1808 edition. Another circumstance more decisive in its implications perhaps than the one just described arises from the fact that there are in the 1808 edition a number of notes which do not appear in the 1801 edition. The presence in Scott's edition, therefore, of notes appearing only in Nichols 1808 makes it highly probable that Scott was printing from that edition. It is possible, of course, that Scott may have transcribed entire notes on the pages of Nichols 1801, but this would have been more troublesome even than transcribing initials. And if he did not do the one, he would almost certainly not have done the other. Assuming, then, that Scott's editorial method and habits in preparing the whole of his edition remained essentially unchanged, and utilizing the evidence provided by existing printer's copy and by a collation of the three editions in question, one may suggest the following distribution of Scott's indebtedness to the two Nichols editions: 14 Scott Nichols Volumes II-V Nichols' 1801 edition Volume VI Pages 1-185, 409-458 from Nichols 1808; pages 233-407 from Nichols 1801 15 Volume VII Pages [1]-333, 346-395, 429-466, 475-549, 553-592 from Nichols 1808; pages 334-345, 467-474, 550-552 from Nichols 1801 Volume VIII Pages [7]-179, [331]-377, 417-437 from Nichols 1808; pages 183-329, 383-415, 439-446 from Nichols 1801 Volume IX Pages 5-12, 49-70, 87-520 from Nichols 1808; pages 13-43, 71-85 from Nichols 1801 Volume X Pages [1]-99, 251-320, 337-562 from Nichols 1808; pages [101]-195, 321-336 from Nichols 1801 Volume XI Pages 1-289 from Nichols 1801; pages [291]-429 from Nichols 1808 Volumes XII-XIX Nichols' 1808 edition 16 Depending as it does on the assumptions discussed above — however reasonable they may be — such a statement of Scott's indebtedness to Nichols inevitably involves an element of uncertainty. In the main, however, the statement is accurate, obviously so where it concerns the volumes of Scott's edition which can be checked against printer's copy. What such a statement cannot give us, of course, is an answer to the question noted earlier, the question why, at any time, Scott should have used Nichols' 1801 edition when the 1808 edition would seem at all times so much the more suited to his purposes. The answer to this question lies partly in the fact that the "1808" edition was not published until late December, 1808, or early January, 1809. 17 Thus if Scott had begun the work of preparing printer's copy in the summer or fall of 1808 he would have had to use 1801 because "1808" was simply not available. That he was in fact at work seems clear. On October 8th he wrote to his friend George Ellis: "Swift is my grande opus at present . . . . in fact, [it] is my only task of great importance" ( Letters , II, 93). By November 15th two volumes were "nearly printed" (II, 125). As I have indicated, however, the late publication of the 1808 edition answers our question only in part. It does not tell us why, even after the 1808 edition became available, Scott continued frequently to use the 1801 edition. For that, we must try to reconstruct one of the mechanical difficulties created for Scott by his practice of re-grouping portions of several Nichols volumes in a single composite volume of his own. However desirable this practice may have been in terms of making a better arrangement of Swift's works (or at least a different one from that of Nichols), it was a practice that must have cost Scott, in the long run, a good deal of trouble. For he could not remove the backs of bound volumes and shift sections of text from one place to another without losing occasionally the use of what, left in its original position, would have been perfectly good copy for the printer. To move, for example, a one-page letter printed on the recto of a single leaf was also to move, and thus to lose, whatever was printed on the verso of that leaf. To shift a piece involving two or more leaves frequently meant losing, as copy, the recto of the first leaf or the verso of the last, or both. Hence the necessity of re-supplying from some other source (here the 1801 edition) the copy that had been lost. Fortunately both the problem and Scott's solution of it are illustrated in the Berg Collection printer's copy for volume VII, a volume which I have described earlier as being a typical product of Scott's method in that it is a mosaic made up of portions of four volumes of the 1808 and two volumes of the 1801 editions. In a section of this volume which he entitled "Miscellaneous Tracts Upon Irish Affairs" (pages 311-592), Scott pulled together treatises from volumes VII-IX and XII of the 1808 edition and volumes IX and XIII of the 1801 edition. Two of these treatises, Maxims Controuled in Ireland and the Letter on Mr M'Culla's Project about Halfpence , were printed together in Nichols' 1808 arrangement (at VIII, 263-271, 272-288). But Scott separated them in making up his own volume, and in so doing was forced to choose between sacrificing either the last paragraph of the first treatise (on page 271 of Nichols VIII) or the title and first paragraph of the second (on page 272 of Nichols VIII). He chose the former course. In the printer's copy he marked for deletion the last paragraph of Maxims Controuled in Ireland while leaving untouched the title and first paragraph of the Letter . Having done this, he then replaced the deleted final paragraph of Maxims by pasting in the last page of the 1801 version (IX, 398). A similar instance of patchwork again involves two tracts which though printed consecutively in the 1808 edition (at VIII, 198-207, 208-209) Scott separated in his own edition (at VII, 350-358, 574-575). In the Berg Collection's copy the text of the first of these tracts ( A Letter to the Archbishop of Dublin, Concerning the Weavers ) is that of the 1808 edition except for the final twenty-two lines, which are printed from the 1801 edition (IX, 359-360). The text of the second tract ( On Giving Badges to the Poor ) is entirely that of the 1808 edition. Again what has happened is that Scott, having moved the second tract (VIII, 208-209) to its new position, moved with it of course the closing lines of the first tract (on VIII, 207), then found it necessary to re-supply them from the 1801 edition. It was quicker to patch up mutilated texts this way than to copy out the "lost" portions in longhand. The need for such patchwork, however, does not explain the occasional appearance of complete 1801 texts in volumes which come largely from the 1808 edition. Scott's volume VII is again a case in point. In this volume five short tracts are taken entirely from the 1801 edition. These tracts account, however, for only twenty-three of the 592 pages in the volume, the rest of which is printed from 1808. Why, one wonders, if 1808 was so largely satisfactory was it not wholly so? The answer to this question is probably available in terms of one or the other of two possible situations. It is easy, in the first of these, to envision Scott's removing a tract from one of the 1808 volumes in order to use it in another, then losing the tract and having to replace it from the 1801 edition. There is no positive evidence that this ever happened, but the speculation that it did is a useful one. It would explain, for instance, the disappearance of the 1808 text of a two-page tract, the Advertisement by Dr Swift, in his Defence against Joshua, Lord Allen , from the British Museum's copy for volume XVII; it would explain also the reappearance of that tract, in the 1801 text, in the Berg Collection copy for volume VII. We may reasonably assume, I think, (1) that Scott removed the Advertisement from the copy for XVII — it was obviously out of place in Swift's correspondence — intending to print it where it more clearly belonged, among the "Miscellaneous Tracts upon Irish Affairs" in volume VII; (2) that he then lost the 1808 version and was forced to use that of 1801. Hence the appearance of a complete 1801 text in a predominantly 1808 volume. The second of the two situations alluded to above, equally speculative but equally useful, assumes not a lost text but that in the manipulation of Nichols' arrangements Scott was sometimes at work simultaneously on at least two volumes of copy for the compositor. On this assumption it would follow that, having only one set of the 1808 edition, 18 Scott would have been forced, in certain circumstances, to use both the 1801 and 1808 editions in order to keep both volumes of copy growing. Such circumstances may well have occasioned the use of the 1801 text for another of the short tracts in volume VII, The Humble Petition of the Footmen In and About the City of Dublin, To the Honourable House of Commons (pages 550-552). In attempting to describe these circumstances, however, I shall have to reconstruct in part the printer's copy for Scott's volume IX. It is hypothetical copy, to be sure, but it is my assumption for the moment that Scott was at work on it at the same time he was at work on the copy for volume VII. Could we examine it today, this hypothetical volume of copy would seem familiar, for like the actual copy for volume VII it would be a mosaic of bits and pieces from several volumes of the two Nichols editions. In making up this copy for volume IX, Scott would have been working at times with the 1808 edition of Nichols' own volume IX (from which in fact several tracts are printed). He would have noted that in this volume Nichols had placed in a group of five tracts on the sacramental test (pages 1-12, 13-20, 21-22, 23, and 27-41) one tract (on pages 24-26), the Humble Petition mentioned above, which had nothing to do with that subject. He would have felt that this piece belonged more properly in the group of "Miscellaneous Tracts Upon Irish Affairs" which he planned for volume VII (that is where, in any case, he decided to place it, as the Berg Collection printer's copy shows). This decision to move the Humble Petition , however, would then have confronted him with a choice: was he to sacrifice the 1808 text on page 23 in order to save the complete text of the Humble Petition on pages 24-26, or was he to sacrifice the title and first paragraph of the Humble Petition on page 24 in order to save the 1808 text of the entire sequence on the sacramental test? Textual evidence proves that he chose the latter course. Thus, in the copy for volume IX, could we examine it today, we would see that he had marked page 24 for deletion. Whether he chose then to remove pages 25-26, the last two pages of the Humble Petition , or simply to mark them also for deletion, we cannot now tell. He could have done either. The simpler thing would have been to mark them for deletion and replace the entire text from the 1801 edition, for he planned in any case to go to that edition for the text of the page 24 which he had just lost. The Berg Collection printer's copy for volume VII discloses only that he printed the entire 1801 text of the Humble Petition : it tells us nothing of Scott's handling of pages 25-26. But we do not need, really, to know about this, for we are concerned here only with explaining the appearance of complete 1801 texts in volumes printed largely from the 1808 edition. The hypothetical interplay between volumes VII and IX described above provides one plausible explanation. However laborious this exposition of what may well have happened, the doing of it would have been a simple thing, a matter of being clever with scissors and pastepot. It is not necessary, of course, to insist that Scott worked on the two volumes at the same time. Little is changed if we picture him concentrating with single mind on the copy for volume IX. But in his extensive rearranging of Nichols' volumes it would have been at least a convenience to build simultaneously upon two or more of his own. At last, in the summer of 1814, the edition was ready for publication. When finally it appeared Nichols must soon have become aware of what Scott had done. We may surmise that he was indignant, for some years later, at the end of a discussion of "Modern Editions of Swift's Works," 19 he wrote the following account of Scott's entry into pastures which for more than a decade had been this own. His sense that an injustice had been done him was still strong: Here [1808] ends my own Literary History as Editor of the Works of the far-famed Dean of St. Patrick's; for, about that period, the great Magician of the North . . . having made a solid breakfast of John Dryden, conceived the idea of a pleasant dinner and supper on Jonathan Swift; which, from the entertainment I had prepared, he found a task of no great difficulty. Laying his potent wand on my humble labours, he very soon, by a neat shuffling of the cards, and by abridging my tedious annotations, (turning lead to gold,) 20 he presented to the Booksellers of Edinburgh an Edition somewhat similar to mine, and consisting of the same number of volumes; condescending, however, to honour me with this brief compliment: "The valuable and laborious Edition of Mr. Nicol (the misnomer is of no consequence) was the first which presented to the publick any thing resembling a complete collection of Swift's Works; and unquestionably those who peruse it, must admire the labour and accuracy of the Editor" . . . . But no thanks are offered to Dr. Barrett, whose liberal communications to my Edition of 1808, are silently transplanted into an Appendix to the First Volume of the Edinburgh Edition of 1814. One is not called upon to suppose that Nichols had troubled himself with a lengthy collation of his own edition and Scott's. He would not have had to. His description of Scott's edition as a "neat shuffling of the cards" is an apt one, if not entirely accurate. In all fairness Scott must be given credit for having added a number of authentic items, particularly letters, to the canon of Swift. Had he not been able to collect them — had he not, for example, with the most patient diplomacy over a period of four and a half years outwaited his friend the Reverend Edward Berwick's reluctance to "expose" the Dean and thus got hold of another forty-one of the Swift-Vanessa letters — Swift's admirers might not have had for a long while some of the materials which Scott made available. Certainly, Scott's enormous popularity, his appeal as a literary man — the author of Marmion, The Lady of the Lake , the editor of the Minstrelsy and of Dryden — opened to him doors which had been closed to Nichols. And for having collected with industry if not always with discrimination he should receive his due. Ironically, however, it is these new additions, some of which we can check against their sources, that show us just how poor the quality of what might be called Scott's "own" editorial work can be. The text of two tracts respecting Wood's coinage, for example, varies widely from its source — two clearly legible transcripts sent to Scott by Dr. Barrett. 21 The same is true of the text of a lengthy passage in Swift's History of the Second Solomon which Scott printed from a transcript of what may have been Swift's original manuscript. 22 It is possible that Scott made copies of these transcripts or that he had copies made by an amanuensis; either way the chance for error would have been increased. It is also possible that the compositor was extraordinarily careless. Whatever the case, in the rather simple matter of accurately printing legible manuscript copy, Scott's edition, where we can check it against its source, is sadly wanting, a fact which makes one suspicious of his text wherever it is based on materials which have disappeared. Furthermore, Scott did not use certain apparently authentic materials which he had on hand at the time of publication. When Theophilus Swift sent Scott the long passage in the History of the Second Solomon mentioned above, he sent him also no fewer than eleven separate readings from the original manuscript (so he called it), each of them accompanied by specific page and line references to Nichols' 1808 edition, with which all were at variance. These variants range in importance from matters of punctuation to substantive additions of half-sentence length. Yet Scott incorporated none of them in his text nor did he include them in notes, when he could easily have done so and when he must have recognized the prior authority of Theophilus Swift's readings — an authority he did not hesitate to accept in printing the several poems and letters that Swift also sent him. Instead, he printed Nichols' text. Occasionally, however, he did supply variant readings from earlier editions. Typical of them is one which occurs at Scott VII, 238, where for the reading "They would, in common humanity, use," in the fifth Drapier's Letter , Scott has supplied the following note: "They are persons of too much honour and justice not to use. — 1st edit." These readings, with almost no exceptions, appear in footnotes, and as a group represent in Scott's thinking little more than the supposition that an earlier version is sometimes worth looking at — the reader is left to decide for himself what Swift's own words might have been. Scott was not much concerned with matters of textual authority. If occasionally he glanced at other editions, they did not shake his devotion to Nichols. The materials which I have presented here indicate two conclusions about the text of Scott's edition of Swift. First, as a reprint almost entirely of Nichols' editions it enjoys only so much authority as Nichols' texts can claim, and that — in the view of modern Swift scholarship, which has largely ignored them — is not very much. Second, its value even in the case of materials newly published from alleged autograph manuscripts or manuscript copies is diminished by the apparent carelessness and haste with which some of these materials, and therefore possibly all of them, were reproduced. Scott's text, in short, is not to be trusted. In the Introduction to his edition of Swift's poems Sir Harold Williams remarked that Scott had made "no endeavor . . . to present a faithful text." 23 This statement is perhaps not appropriate to the whole of Scott's text. But like Cadell's stricture, noted earlier, it requires in the most generous estimate only slight qualification.</field>

The exact date of publication is in question. Lockhart states that the edition came out on July 1, 1814 ( Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart. [1838], I, 474). But that this cannot have been the case is clear from Scott's letter to Matthew Weld Hartstonge of July 18, 1814: "Constable has again changed his mind and publishes instantly . . ." ( Letters , III, 464). In connection with this passage, Grierson points out that Lockhart is mistaken (III, 464, n. 2) but repeats the mistake himself at another point (IV, 490, n. 1): "Scott's edition of Swift appeared on the 1st July 1814." 3 Cadell to Constable, May 6, 1814.

Signatures, pagination, texts, and notes in the British Museum copies are identical with those of volumes XI and XII of Nichols' 1808 edition. I use a microfilm of the British Museum copies. 6 The running title "Epistolary Correspondence" has been deleted, too, even though Scott did not mark it for deletion. The compositor may have dropped it of his own initiative, or Scott may have indicated the deletion on the proof-sheet. 7 This transcript was sent to Scott by his Irish correspondent Matthew Weld Hartstonge, who was responsible, directly or indirectly, for procuring for Scott thirty-one of the eighty-five previously unpublished letters of Swift which Scott printed for the first time. The letter to Blachford mentioned above is one of three to Blachford which Hartstonge sent in transcript, having copied them, he said, from the originals which were temporarily in his possession (Hartstonge to Scott, July 2, 1811, National Library of Scotland MS. 881, fol. 86r). 8 I am grateful to Mrs. Oliver Orr, former reference assistant in the University of North Carolina Library, for having called these volumes to my attention. I should like also to express my appreciation to Mr. John D. Gordan, Curator of the Berg Collection, for permission to consult these volumes. I quote here the card catalogue entry in the Berg Collection. 9 Among them A Proposal for Giving Badges to the Beggars in All the Parishes of Dublin , which appears in the Nichols 1808 edition at IX, 70-82, reprinted at Scott VII, 581-592. On the next to the last page of this tract (i.e., p. 81, sig. G in the Berg Collection copy) is printed "VOL. IX." 10 A letter from Sir John Browne to Swift dated April 4, 1728 (Nichols XII, 15-20, reprinted at Scott VII, 366-369). This letter is missing from the British Museum copy of Nichols XII. 11 Four of the five tracts mentioned are from volume IX: The Story of the Injured Lady (pp. 307-315), The Answer to the Injured Lady (pp. 316-319), The Substance of What Was Said by the Dean of St Patrick's to the Lord Mayor and Some of the Aldermen of Dublin; When His Lordship Came to Present the Said Dean With His Freedom in a Gold Box (pp. 65-69), and To the Honourable House of Commons, &amp;c. The Humble Petition of the Footmen in and about the City of Dublin (pp. 411-413). Scott reprints these tracts at VII, 334-342, 343-345, 467-472, and 550-552. The fifth tract, the Advertisement by Dr Swift, in his Defence against Joshua, Lord Allen , appears in Nichols' 1801 edition at XIII, 471-472; Scott reprints it at VII, 473-474. 12 I have collated the texts under discussion here. Harold Williams, ed. Jonathan Swift : Journal to Stella (1948), p. lii, notes, too, that Scott was "content to take his text directly from Nichols" (i.e., from the 1801 edition). 13 An undated letter from Scott to Constable provides something of a clue in the matter: "The volumes of Swift (besides the first) which are wanting in the copy sent me are the 7th. 8th. and 18th. I should be glad to have them as soon as possible &amp; also the Examiner which is become most essential" ( Letters , II, 5). Grierson places this letter among those written in January, 1808, which is surely too early, for on February 28th of that year Scott was only "on the eve of concluding a bargain with a bookseller to edit Swift's work" (II, 26). It was not until July 25th that he settled the terms of the contract with Constable (II, 79). In another undated letter, which Grierson (rightly, I believe) places among those written late in October, 1808, Scott asks: "Have you ever got me a copy of the Examiner. I am in great want of it" (II, 112). The two letters clearly relate to each other through the reference to Swift's Examiner , and it would seem reasonable to place the earlier one in August or September, 1808 — that is, after the formalizing of the contract but before Scott's second request for the Examiner . If this date is even roughly accurate, the edition referred to in the earlier letter must be the 1801 edition, since the 1808 edition did not in fact appear until much later in the year (see below, n. 17). It is not likely that Constable failed to provide Scott the volumes which were "wanting." 14 Volume I of Scott's edition ( Memoirs of Jonathan Swift, D. D., Dean of St. Patrick's Dublin ) is not properly an object of consideration at this point, although its lengthy Appendix (pp. i-cxliv) is partially reprinted from the Reverend Dr. John Barrett's Essay on the Earlier Part of the Life of Swift , printed separately for Johnson, Nichols, and others in 1808 but also as a part of the first volume of Nichols, 1808 edition (pp. lxii-cxlviii). This Essay Scott seems to have owned in its separately published form ( Letters , II, 145). Other portions of Scott's Appendix were reprinted from the 1808 edition, and still others from materials sent to Scott by his Irish correspondents. 15 Scott's version of The History of John Bull (VI, 233-407) follows Nichols' 1808 text and reprints many of its notes, but its division into parts and chapters is unlike that in either of the Nichols editions, corresponding more nearly to the division in the first edition of the History , a copy of which is in Scott's library at Abbotsford ( Catalogue of the Library at Abbotsford [1838], p. 304). Scott was quite possibly using both Nichols and the first edition. 16 Volumes XV-XIX are taken up almost entirely with Swift's correspondence, all of which is printed from the 1808 edition except for certain letters which Scott published for the first time. 17 Although the edition was announced for immediate publication in the April, 1808, issue of The British Critic (Vol. 31, Pt. 1 [January-June], p. 460), I have found no evidence in contemporary journals or newspapers that it appeared earlier than the first week of January, 1809. Something delayed its appearance — perhaps the fire which destroyed Nichols' printing office, warehouses, and most of his literary stock in February, 1808. Nichols describes the destruction in considerable detail in the Gentleman's Magazine for February, 1808 (Vol. 78, Pt. 1 [January-June], p. 99). An advertisement in The Times of London for Tuesday, December 27, 1808 (p. 2, col. 2), indicates that the edition "will speedily be published, handsomely printed in 19 volumes 8vo.," but it is not until Friday, January 6, 1809, that The Times advertises it as actually available (p. 2, col. 2). A letter from Scott to Constable &amp; Company dated January 2, 1809, mentions the difficulty of drawing up "a complete advertisement of Swift until we should see what was contained in Nicols edition now coming out. So soon as that can be procured I will furnish you with a full advertisement" ( Letters , II, 145). Again to Constable &amp; Company, on January 22, 1809, he wrote: "After inspection of the New Edition of Swift by Nichols I conceive some advantage may be gaind in the public opinion by holding out an intention of consolidating the mass of information which they have prefixd to their edition into a distinct narrative . . ." (II, 154). Clearly the edition appeared in the last week of 1808 or the first week of 1809. 18 There is no evidence that Scott ever had two sets. Had he had a second he would surely have used it rather than the 1801 edition, for ease of reference if for no other reason. (He would have known already the exact place in the 1808 edition at which he would find a duplicate text.) But in almost every instance where mutilation of text occurred through rearrangement of Nichols' order, Scott replaced lost text from the 1801 edition. A few instances of longhand copying occur, but these argue, too, that Scott had only one set of 1808. Why should he have copied had he had a second? I am grateful to my colleague Mr. Robert W. Lovett for supplying me this line of argument. 19 Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century (1828), V, 396-397. 20 "The pecuniary remuneration to Sir Walter Scott was precisely thirty times as much as I had received, or expected, for my Three Ediitons" (Nichols' note, Illustrations , V, 397). Scott got £1500. 21 Scott wrongly attributed the tracts to Swift. Barrett's transcripts are preserved in National Library of Scotland MS. 991, foll. 33 r -38 v , together with other materials which Scott received in connection with the edition. Dr. Barrett was librarian of Trinity College, Dublin. See above, n. 14. 22 The passage forms paragraph three of this piece as it is printed by Scott (IX, 513-520). Except in this passage Scott follows the text of Nichols' 1808 edition (IX, 362-368). "I have not by me," wrote Theophilus Swift, Deane Swift's nephew, who sent the passage to Scott, "this Volume published by my father, but I have by me what is much better, the original Tract itself , which now lies before me; and from which I will transcribe the passage at large on the next sheet . . ." (National Library of Scotland MS. 882, fol. 25 v ). The words the original Tract itself are underlined by Swift, and refer possibly to Jonathan Swift's MS of the History , or to what Swift took to be the MS. "The word Beast in the first paragraph," he continued, "is interlined; that is, written over the word Bitch , which is half scratched out with with [sic] his pen" (MS. 882, fol. 26r). It seems likely that he was working from a manuscript copy of the tract and also likely that it was Swift's holograph. In any case, he appears to think of the changes as author changes. 23 The Poems of Jonathan Swift (1937), I, xliv.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Text of Keats's "Ode on Indolence" by Jack Stillinger</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Students of Keats seem to have accepted without question the idea that R. M. Milnes rearranged the stanzas of the "Ode on Indolence" when he first published the poem in his Life, Letters, and Literary Remains, of John Keats (1848), and that H. W. Garrod restored (as he claimed) the "true order" in his most recent editions of Keats's Poetical Works (O.S.A. edn., 1956; revised O.E.T. edn., 1958). The matter deserves correction. The order indicated by Charles Brown, in the single authoritative source of the poem, was followed exactly by Milnes and was not disturbed until Professor Garrod took it upon himself to re-order the stanzas. The fact is that there are neither textual nor critical grounds for the current standard arrangement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charles Brown's transcript (Garrod's T 2 ), now at Harvard, is our only manuscript version of the poem deriving from a Keats holograph, since the other extant transcript, by Richard Woodhouse ( W 2 ), is plainly a copy of Brown's, as Woodhouse indicated by writing "from C.B." at the end. Brown transcribed the stanzas in the following order (each first line here represents an entire stanza; arrow brackets &lt; &gt; indicate Brown's deletions of original stanza numbers): 1 One morn before me were three figures seen . . . 2 How is it, Shadows, that I knew ye not? . . . &lt;3&gt; 4 They faded, and, forsooth! I wanted wings . . . &lt;4&gt; 6 So, ye three Ghosts, adieu! Ye cannot raise . . . &lt;5&gt; 3 A third time pass'd they by, and, passing, turn'd . . . 5 A third time came they by; — alas! wherefore? . . . The uncorrected "5" at the head of this final stanza is important, for it can mean but one thing — that Brown discovered a mistake and corrected the numbering of the preceding three stanzas before he wrote out the last stanza. Apparently he was copying from several separate sheets in Keats's holograph. When he came upon a final stanza repeating "A third time" he must have realized that something was wrong with the order of stanzas as he had thus far transcribed them. At this point, presumably in consultation with Keats, he set them right by renumbering the last three stanzas he had copied, and then wrote out the remaining stanza, which he correctly headed "5."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Brown's corrected order is thus the following: 1 One morn before me . . . 2 How is it, Shadows . . . 3 A third time pass'd they by . . . 4 They faded, and, forsooth! . . . 5 A third time came they by . . . 6 So, ye three Ghosts, adieu! . . . Woodhouse copied the stanzas in this order "from C.B.," and Milnes used Brown's transcript as printer's copy for his text in the Life of 1848. Milnes did, however, make an unauthorized substantive change. Puzzled by the repetition of "A third time" in Brown's stanzas 3 and 5, he altered the first line of the fifth stanza to read, "And once more came they by; — alas! wherefore?" Professor Garrod was of course aware of this change, and perhaps was unduly prejudiced against Milnes's text more generally because of it. Either forgetting or perhaps never really aware of the significance of the uncorrected "5" in Brown's transcript, he seems to have formed the idea that Milnes also was responsible for changing the order of the stanzas ("In T 2 ," he writes in his textual notes to the poem, "the numbering has been altered to that of 1848 "; "The sense has been obscured by the placing of the stanzas in the wrong order"). Incorporating a much more drastic change than any that had occurred to Milnes, his Oxford editions give the stanzas thus, with Brown's fifth stanza moved up to follow stanza 2: I One morn before me . . . II How is it, Shadows . . . III A third time came they by . . . IV A third time pass'd they by . . . V They faded, and, forsooth! . . . VI So, ye three Ghosts, adieu! . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since this "true order" that Professor Garrod settled on has no precedent in either of the transcripts or in Milnes's Life , it must have been arrived at by some process of critical reasoning. Let us briefly consider, therefore, the argument or "action" of the poem in each version. In Brown's corrected order it stands as follows. Stanza 1 . The poet sees three strange figures, who pass before him and then come again. Stanza 2 . He addresses them, demanding why they are disguised as they are and why they have come to disturb his pleasant summer-indolence. Stanza 3 . The figures pass a third time, turn briefly to face the poet, and then fade; he desires to follow them, recognizing them as Love, Ambition, and Poesy. Stanza 4 . The poet wants wings to pursue them, yet knows that his desire is foolish: love, ambition, even poesy have no joys for him; he calls for an age "shelter'd from annoy," that is, protected from just such worldly instrusions as the figures represent. Stanza 5 . The figures return a third time, but to no avail; luxuriating in his mood, the poet will not be drawn out of it — "'twas a time [for the figures] to bid farewell!" Stanza 6 . The poet bids the figures adieu. In brief, the poet sees three figures, Love, Ambition, and Poesy, who threaten his idleness; he is momentarily shaken and longs to follow them, but then recovers himself, refuses to surrender his mood, and tells the figures to go away. In Professor Garrod's arrangement, the general point is the same, but the progress is somewhat less readily graspable. With Brown's stanza 5 moved forward to come between stanzas 2 and 3, the original connection between the penultimate and final stanzas is broken ("'twas a time to bid farewell! . . . So, ye three Ghosts, adieu!"), and the poet's initial banishment of the figures is made to come before the account of his desire to pursue the figures and join them. Obviously the rearranged version at one time made good sense to Professor Garrod, and it may still strike some readers (perhaps merely because they are accustomed to it) as being as reasonable as Brown's. But it cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered so superior as to warrant a change in the order of stanzas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There are of course obscurities in the poem, but I think not more than two. The first occurs in lines 3-5 of the second stanza: Was it a silent deep-disguised plot To steal away, and leave without a task My idle days? Whether "steal away" is read as transitive "steal away [= rob me of] . . . My idle days") or intransitive (= "tiptoe away"), the phrase "leave without a task" makes no sense in its context. Everything else in the stanza questions the figures' interruption of the poet's indolence; but if they came in a "deep-disguised plot" to make his days taskless, they would of course be furthering rather than disrupting the idleness that the poet wishes to maintain. The other obscurity involves the repetition of "A third time." This seems unresolvable, whether in Brown's order or Garrod's, unless one distinguishes between passing and coming . In the first stanza Keats seems to make such a distinction as he describes the figures going and then returning: They pass'd, like figures on a marble Urn, When shifted round to see the other side; They came again; as when the Urn once more Is shifted round, the first seen Shades return. ( T 2 ) It may be that "A third time pass'd they by" in Brown's third stanza represents a movement in one direction, and "A third time came they by" in Brown's fifth represents a counter-shift or return. My general point here, though, is that neither of these obscurities is in any way helped by Professor Garrod's or any other re-ordering of the stanzas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The "Ode on Indolence" is not in the same class with the more famous odes to Psyche, to a Nightingale, on a Grecian Urn, on Melancholy, and to Autumn. It lacks the dramatic tension that characterizes the first four, and the sharpness of imagery of all five. The poet refuses to engage in any serious conflict with Love, Ambition, and Poesy, and the poem probably genuinely reflects the indolence that is its subject. The omission of the poem from the Lamia volume of 1820 suggests that Keats himself recognized its inferiority (his remark to Sarah Jeffrey, 9 June 1819, that "the thing I have most enjoyed this year has been writing an ode to Indolence," does not, even if intended seriously, mean that he considered the poem a success). But even a third- or fourth-rate poem, if printed at all, deserves to have its stanzas given in the correct order, and since the "Ode on Indolence" is sometimes discussed with the "great odes" and even occasionally still included among the "great odes" we at least ought to know what the poem was most probably intended to look like. For a proper text we must go back to Brown's transcript.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Swinburne's Heptalogia Improved by Robert A. Greenberg</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Swinburne's continuing interest in the Theban legend, "with its infinite suggestions and significances," 1 provided the binding metaphor when in 1880 he gathered a series of his parodies, written over a period of two decades, under the omnibus title, Specimens of Modern Verse: The Heptalogia, or The Seven against Sense: A Cap with Seven Bells . The volume was issued anonymously, and obviously with good cause since six of its subjects were alive and still writing. It was essential, moreover, to Swinburne's design that it be published on the same date as his Studies in Song , which he intended to acknowledge. "How is it," he inquires irritably of Andrew Chatto, "that no copies of the Heptalogia accompanied these Studies? You will remember that it was my particular desire that the two books should appear together on the same day." 2 Though simultaneous publication would have the effect of associating the two collections, the overtness of the gesture might serve to keep them sufficiently apart as to prevent the matter of authorship from becoming more than a tantalizing likelihood. Two further measures were calculated to cloud the issue. In the "Nephelidia" parody, Swinburne numbered himself among the modern heroes (Tennyson, the Brownings, Patmore, "Owen Meredith," Rossetti) besieging the walls of poetic sense; and then as a sign of friendship with Browning, he borrowed the opening lines of Landor's "To Robert Browning" for the epigraph to his own "Song for the Centenary of Walter Savage Landor," which initiated the Studies volume. Since the two poets responded to the same master and had received in their several ways his acknowledgement, it was as unlikely that Swinburne would parody Browning as that he would parody himself or his old friend Rossetti. Ambiguity there was, but the truth, as Swinburne doubtless assumed, was not to remain dark for very long. On the book's appearance, Rossetti wrote briefly to Watts-Dunton, asking whether the "whole" was from Swinburne's hand and whether it appeared with his sanction. Though he had yet to see the collection, its contents "as reported seemed very dubious as to friendship." 3 Whatever the mollification Watts-Dunton may have offered, it is not recorded; and indeed the record of allusion to the Heptalogia gradually closes off, much as though an indiscretion (however well-loved) were henceforth to be dead and buried. Perhaps this was a further concession to the cautious new regimen imposed at The Pines, though it is to be recalled that Watts-Dunton proved no obstacle when late in 1881 the poet published his "Disgust: A Dramatic Monologue" in reaction to Tennyson's "Despair: A Dramatic Monologue." In any event, as late as 1896, T. J. Wise and W. R. Nicoll thought it safe to pronounce, as if drawing upon a private confidence, that "it may without hesitation now be stated that Mr. Swinburne has admitted the authorship of The Heptalogia , but has at the same time expressed his determination never to republish the volume." 4 What enterprise may have already been brewing in Wise's imagination must be left to inference, but he and Nicoll would have done well to hesitate before entering the second claim. For when Swinburne proceeded to order his poetry for the Collected Poems of 1904, the Heptalogia was accorded its proper position among the later miscellanies that compose the fifth volume. At that point, Swinburne not only formally acknowledged his authorship, but, contrary to his usual practice, made substantial alterations in the contents. Having shown himself a false prophet, Wise simply passed the matter over in his Swinburne Bibliography of 1919, not without noting, however, that all of the revisions the poet was to absorb in his reprint had been recorded in "two copies of the first edition. . . . One of these, which had belonged to Andrew Chatto, was sold . . . on June 29th, 1916, for £69. The other, which belonged to Watts-Dunton, was included in a bequest . . . to one of his executors." 5 Of the two copies Wise mentions, only one — the Chatto — has come to light, 6 and its provenance becomes evident from two letters published for the first time in Cecil Lang's edition of the correspondence. On December 7, 1899, Swinburne writes to Georgiana Burne-Jones, the widow of his long-time friend: It would be a very great kindness to me, and I hope not any trouble to you if you could send me back the copy of my little book "The Heptalogia," with a quantity of MS additions on the margins which I once sent to Ned. It is to be reprinted, and I have lost a copy in which I had transcribed these additions. The volume was duly received, and two months later, Swinburne presumably having copied from it, it is returned "with many thanks." 7 The two copies alluded to by Wise were thus unquestionable latecomers, their transcriptions based on the copy Swinburne had presented long before to Burne-Jones. Though this volume has yet to be unearthed, it turns out that another, contemporary with it, does in fact exist; and there is good reason to assume that it is a close approximation, if not a precise version, of the volume that Swinburne used as his source. In its margins are to be found, in Swinburne's hand, virtually all of the revisions he was to incorporate in the reprint. Attached to it, and of significant bibliographical and biographical relevance, are three letters in the hand of its original owner, John Nichol, addressed to his Glasgow bookseller, Hugh Hopkins. Nichol had first met Swinburne while both were undergraduates at Oxford, and though he was to return to Scotland soon after taking his degree, their friendship remained fast through the 1860's and 1870's. In June of 1880 Nichol passed a gratifying week with Swinburne and Watts-Dunton at their new accommodations; the Heptalogia appeared in December of that year; and in March of the next Nichol published his review of it in the Glasgow Herald . 8 But as happened so often to Swinburne's old friendships, his relations with Nichol gradually lessened and came finally to seem irrelevant to the needs of his present world. 9 Nichol's resentment, of which Swinburne seems never to have been conscious, provides the biographical burden of the letters that follow. The first, dated 20 September 1890, establishes the context and tone of the other two: Dear Sir, I do not myself value Heptalogia at so much as is offered for it, especially as I have already said in a review all that I have to say of it: &amp; I do not like the attack on my friend "Owen Meredith" at all. But in full reflection I have come to the conclusion that I cannot sell the book with notes which may seem or be said to be of the nature of a private communication, ie that it must not be sold while both Swinburne &amp; I are alive. He has of late years become such an egotist that I do not so much as I once wd have done, consider his feelings in the matter: but I can allow no one [anyth deleted ] anywhere to be able to say that for the sake of a little money I did an ungentlemanly thing. I did not send the book to you for sale but for sight. Your foreman may have misunderstood me however: &amp; you may give my explanation, with my excuses, to the gentleman who has offered for the book. Yours truly The second letter, dated 19 October, shows still the firmness of Nichol's resolve, though with a minor concession: Dear Sir, I called when in town last but you were out. As I may be hurried when passing through on my way south, it would save trouble if you could make up our balance — on one side my debt to you for packing, etc, on the other sums due for Atalanta &amp; doing estimate of books taken in &amp; amounts received from Messrs Smart and McCormick. Then if convenient send me here a cheque for the balance. I shall call for Heptalogia: tell the gentleman that he may have it for the sum offered immediately on [Swin deleted ] my death or Swinburne's. Yours truly Nichol's allusion to the sale of Atalanta in Calydon , quite possibly Swinburne's presentation copy, suggests the degree of souring of their friendship. His commitment at this point to only a posthumous sale of the Heptalogia gives way in the next letter, dated 23 October. The opening concerns Nichol's accounts, and then he promises to come down on the 31st. . . . I shall tell you definitely about the "Heptalogia". The author has not answered a letter of mine which required an answer: &amp; if he really means to cut me because I [have become a friend of deleted ] accepted an invitation from Lord Lytton ["Owen Meredith"], I shall cut him . Three lines are then heavily stricken out, so emphatically that only two words — "old days" — are at all intelligible; but they perhaps intimate the drift of the rest. The letter resumes: Tell your customer, with my compts: — 1 / I do not like the MS abuse, or I should not dream of parting with it. 2. I do not think he would be making a bad bargain, if he had liberty to sell the book; for it is a curiosity &amp; to Swinburne worshippers (of whom I am not one), a treasure. 3. But , in such a curious transaction (if I decide to complete it), as he knows my name, I think, I ought to know his: and I would require his promise not to show about, or part with, the book till my death or Swinburne's. In the first event I should certainly, save through "planchet," have no more to say ; in the second (which be far hence) I would feel free from obligation. Ascertain, &amp; then let lie till I call . . . . The identity of the shadowy gentleman — indeed, whether it was he who made the purchase — remains uncertain. When the volume next appears, it is as part of the Jerome Kern Collection, from which it was bought in 1929 by Owen D.

      <field name="fulltext">II What is especially apparent in the preceding correspondence is that though Swinburne's revisions were first published in the Poems of 1904, he did not compose them (but for certain exceptions subsequently to be noted) specifically for that edition. At the very outermost, they can conceivably be dated of the summer of 1890; but the likely time is considerably earlier, quite possibly soon after the volume's appearance in 1880. Two reconstructions seem to me possible. Swinburne, whose parodic powers are hardly to be matched in English literature, received an early issue of the Heptalogia and reimmersed himself in the several parodies. Having made his revisions, he transcribed them into certain of the presentation copies — to Burne-Jones, to Nichol, perhaps to others. The possibility of a second edition so soon after the first was probably furthest from his mind: the revisions, rather, were in the nature of a private pleasure, what Nichol scrupulously termed a "private communication." Seen in this light, their closest parallel occurs in the day-to-day correspondence with these same friends: those parodic flights on the wings of Dickens, Sade, a newspaper clipping, the Old Testament; Swinburne could hardly restrain himself at such moments, and they make a considerable joy for the reader of the letters. The alternative construction would have the poet returning some time in the 1880's to the text, making the changes, transcribing them in other copies of the first edition, and then sending them for some unclear reason (perhaps as yet unclear) to Burne-Jones, Nichol, and possibly others. Nor is it likely, even disregarding the restraining hand of Watts-Dunton, that Swinburne would have had hopes for a new edition some time in the 1880's. The book's initial reception had been far from happy, as Swinburne may be heard complaining in the Letters ; and he resigns himself once more to the lack of a readership. Having learned long before to expect little, he can hardly be disappointed. 11 And so the matter rested, until the poet's request of Georgiana Burne-Jones in 1899. It is doubtful that the allusion in that letter to a "reprint" implies that he was contemplating a separate issue of the Heptalogia . But for Swinburne himself, all those he had taken as fair game were long dead; the volume by itself was not likely to matter much as a greeting to the new century. Very probably his intent was to prepare a complete version for the forthcoming Poems , which had been in the planning at least as far back as 1896: by then he had already begun composing the "Dedicatory Epistle" to Watts-Dunton. 12</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Swinburne's revisions separate by time into two categories: those we find transcribed in the Nichol copy, and those not present there and presumably incorporated at some point between 1900 and 1904. A subdivision of the second category consists of Swinburne's revision of his revisions, his several minor changes in the material he had added to the Nichol. The three parodies left untouched are those of Mrs. Browning ("The Poet and the Woodlouse"), of Rossetti ("Sonnet for a Picture"), and of Swinburne himself. "The Higher Pantheism in a Nutshell" Modeled upon Tennyson's "The Higher Pantheism," which had appeared in 1869, Swinburne's version consisted originally of twenty-four lines, six more than the original. In the margins of the Nichol are inked two additional lines, which in 1904 become lines 15-16: More is the whole than a part: but half is more than the whole: Clearly, the soul is the body: but is not the body the soul? "John Jones's Wife" Browning's "James Lee" appeared initially in Dramatis Personae (1864), but when reissued four years later it bore the title "James Lee's Wife." On its first appearance, Swinburne's parody was called simply "John Jones"; no change of title occurs in the Nichol, which suggests that Swinburne was still unaware of Browning's adjustment and, perhaps, that little time passed between the publication of Heptalogia and Swinburne's revisions. However, in the Chatto and then in 1904, it is newly titled to reflect Browning's revision, and possibly to parody it since Swinburne's emphasis is as much on Browning's unintelligibility (who is the speaker?) as on his diction. In keeping with the original, Swinburne divides his poem into parts, each with its appropriate heading ("By the Cliff," "Up the Spout"); but though Browning's sections total nine, Swinburne relents at five. "I. At the Piano." The one revision in this section is in the form of an omission. In 1880 line 12 reads, Hues of the prawn's tail or comb that makes dawn stale, 1 so red for our sins! The number is resumed at the bottom of the page: 1 Whose youth and freshness Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning. — SHAKESPEARE. The juxtaposition sets Shakespeare's felicity against Browning's harshness; in showing the comparison, Browning is made presumably to vaunt his improvement on the original. Number and note remain unaltered in both the Nichol and the Chatto, but are omitted from the published version of 1904. "III. On the Sands." Totals twenty-four stanzas in 1880; three more (X through XII) are added in the Nichol, the remainder renumbered. Minor revisions of the Nichol material show in 1904: 1. 49: contents for suffices; (see?), added 1. 59: o' for oh As much as he admired the vigor of Browning's imagination, Swinburne could not be reconciled to his style — his "miserable English language, garotted, gouged, her jaw broken and the teeth driven down her throat." 13 Two revisions which strongly suggest the texture Swinburne sought are recorded for the first time in the Chatto: 1. 8: Chicken or egg for Nay, but, Meg 1. 25: and be hanged to the pup! for and who cares for the pup? "V. Off the Pier." Consists of eight stanzas in 1880, to which a ninth (VI) is added in Nichol, Swinburne renumbering those that follow. The nine are given without further change in 1904. Allusions in the new stanza help, I think, in the question of dating: . . . Shakespeare (Malone's) Might have said sleep was murdered — new scholiasts have sent you pills To purge text of him! Bread? give me — Scottice — scones! The "new scholiasts" alludes, obviously, to the followers of F. J. Furnivall, with whom Swinburne had been feuding since the mid-1870's. Their controversy, after a momentary lapse in intensity, reached high climax by the start of 1881 with the appearance of two pamphlets: Furnivall's The 'Co.' of Pigsbrook &amp; Co. (for Pigsbrook we are to read Swines-burn) and J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps' Correspondence with Robt. Browning, president of New Shakespere society, relative to language used by Mr. Furnivall in speaking of Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps . Swinburne was especially concerned that Browning should be in alliance with Furnivall, and he made the overture of sending him a copy of Studies in Song , which Browning gracefully acknowledged. 14 Neither poet alludes to the Heptalogia , nearly a half of which is devoted to Elizabeth and Robert Browning. "The Person of the House" Patmore's Angel in the House had appeared in 1854, and if Wise's dating is to be trusted, Swinburne composed his version in 1859, while he was yet at Oxford. 15 The one revision, present in Nichol and retained in 1904, occurs in line 16 which as first printed had read: "Kit, Nick, Dick, Mark, Aminadab." For "Kit," the diminutive of Christopher, the Christ-bearer, Swinburne substitutes "Luke." The change was motivated probably by the desire to afford a private pleasure since its effect is primarily visual, the inked in replacement demonstrating to Nichol and Burne-Jones how the poet can modulate from assonance to consonance, sustain the association with Mark and especially with Aminadab (see Luke 3:33), and generally affirm the household religiosity of the speaker. Swinburne knew better than to intrude when later the new-born in question is christened Paul Cyril Athanasius John. "Last Words of a Seventh-Rate Poet" This is the longest and, as its title implies, the most merciless of the seven parodies; it assaults poet and works. Swinburne was, or pretended to be, personally offended by Lytton's public sneers in his direction; 16 more important, as a poet he was affronted by the mannerisms of this "poeticule" — at once casual and flaccid and unoriginal, the qualities brought into focus in the parody. Swinburne accuses Lytton of plagiarism and seems to have enjoyed the irony of plagiarizing the plagiarist; his additions, the bulk of them in Nichol, are lavish. 1. 41: lava for ova ( in Nichol and retained ) 11. 54-55: in Nichol and retained 11. 72-77: in Nichol and retained 1. 83: disputing my claim to Empedocles, Maud for assign to his hand the Confessional, Bill ( in Nichol and retained ) 11. 130-133: in Nichol and retained with minor revisions : 1. 132: disdainful for contemptuous 1. 133: it was for they were 1. 140: lips for life ( in Nichol and retained ) 11. 206-213: in Nichol and retained with minor revisions : 1. 207: title for rank; always, added 1. 211: reader — to for public, to 11. 222-229: in Nichol and retained 1. 237: vent for write ( in Nichol and retained ) There is, however, one major addition which appears initially in the Chatto copy from which it is then carried into the 1904 edition. As his close, under the heading "Specimen from the speaker's original poems," Swinburne appends a travesty of the most famous of the lyrics in Maud , thus offering in evidence a document in support of his earlier revision of line 83: Come into the orchard, Anne, For the dark owl, Night, has fled, And Phosphor slumbers, as well as he can With a daffodil sky for a bed: And the musk of the roses perplexes a man And the pimpernel [worries deleted ] muddles his head. Swinburne's primary target remains, of course, "Owen Meredith," his chosen mask, though one may perhaps suspect the faintest malice in the direction of Tennyson.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The "Lost" Number of the Southern Literary Gazette by John C. Guilds</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a recent study of William Gilmore Simms's editorship of the Southern Literary Gazette I speculated whether the twelfth number of the "new" series had been published as announced; whether (as was generally believed) the number had simply failed to materialize; or whether it was issued, on November 7, 1829, under the new title, the Pleiades, and Southern Literary Gazette . 1 From the evidence at hand I concluded that the twelfth number for November 1, 1829, probably had been issued and that it probably did include the "Confessions of a Murderer," as Simms himself had claimed. The happy discovery of the long lost November 1, 1829, Southern Literary Gazette 2 proves both of these guesses to have been correct. The present note concludes my study of Simms and the Southern Literary Gazette by briefly examining the contents of the twelfth number, ascribing to Simms those contributions for which evidence of authorship exists, and commenting upon the new light thrown upon the Martin Faber controversy by the discovery of the "Confessions of a Murderer." Like earlier numbers of SLG , the final number was largely filled with Simms's own writings. In its twenty-four pages the November 1 issue contains twenty items (none signed by name): ten poems, three stories or sketches, four essays, an editorial, and an index (called "Table of Contents") to the entire second volume. 3 Of the nineteen contributions ten (the three stories, six of the poems, and the editorial) can safely be ascribed to Simms: two are signed by pseudonyms Simms used elsewhere in SLG , "On the Death of an Infant," a poem signed "E.," and "The Opportunity," a story or sketch signed "G."; five other poems, "To Thee," "EPIGRAM, On a Young Lady who looked Witty Things, but never spoke them," "Epitaph" (beginning "We rear o'er thee no splendid tomb"), "Stanzas" (beginning "Sweet be the laughing skies around"), and "Stanzas" (beginning "Well may my friendships all decline—") were later republished in collections of Simms's poetry (as was "On the Death of an Infant"); "Chronicles of Ashley River—No 6" is the final installment of the series Simms had begun with the July 15, 1829, number; "L'ENVOY" identifies itself as the work of the "Editor"; and of course the other piece of fiction known to have been written by Simms is the long sought, much speculated upon forerunner of Martin Faber , the "Confessions of a Murderer." In addition, on the basis of internal evidence, "Prospects of a National Literature" and "Epitaph" (beginning "His was the heart that passionate feeling warm'd") can also be assigned to the young editor. (These twelve titles bring the total number of contributions by Simms to the full run of SLG to 113, ninety-eight of which are certain, fifteen probable.) 4 Although insufficient evidence exists to establish the authorship of the other seven contributions to the November 1, 1829, number, it seems safe to assume that at least some of them are also the work of the over-taxed editor. Three of the seven are poems: "The Charter Oak," signed "H."; "Rain not Wanted," unsigned; and "On Reading the Works of an American Poet, who died of Want," unsigned. The four prose contributions of undesignated authorship are "Capt. Hall on his Tour," unsigned; "Bacon's 'Novum Organon Scientiarium,'" unsigned; "Glances at Adam Smith," signed "W."; and "Excerpts," unsigned. The most ambitious of the "authorless" selections is the long (144-line) "On Reading the Work of an American Poet, who died of Want," which for two reasons could possibly be attributed to Simms: its rude bombast seems characteristic of his poetry; and the bracketed note which introduces it perhaps suggests the editor's authorship: "[The following Poem, made its appearance in one of our city papers, some time since, in a very imperfect state. It is now, after undergoing many alterations, (we hope for the better,) submitted to the public. —Ed.]" (n.s., I, 284). In truth, however, "On Reading the Works of an American Poet, who died of Want" does small credit to its author, whoever he be. Of the contributions attributed to Simms the "Confessions of a Murderer" is by far the most interesting. Its discovery makes possible, for the first time, the unequivocal validation of the claim by Simms (in indignantly denying having plagiarized F. M. Reynolds's "Miserrimus ") that the origin of Martin Faber lay in one of his own early published writings: In conclusion, and to refer again to the supposed resemblance of "Martin Faber" to "Miserrimus," we may add, that the chief incidents of the former work were first published in the Southern Literary Gazette, a periodical put forth in Charleston, South Carolina, about seven years ago. It filled some eight or ten pages in the second volume of that journal, where the reader, if curious, will find it. From the paper entitled, "Confessions of a Murderer," the work was subsequently elaborated—partly in 1829, partly in 1832, and finally revised for publication in 1833, when it appeared in its present form. In the process of elaboration, new persons and new events received their existence. Thus, the character of William Harding, which does not appear in the original production, was introduced, and all the softening and gentler features of the work were the fruit of an after labour. The sterner, darker features of the story—those in their nature most resembling "Miserrimus," were all conceived in the first instance, and nearly all of them appear in the story as it was first given to the public, in the shape of a contribution to a monthly magazine. 5 Indeed, one is struck by the accuracy of most of the statements in the paragraph: (1) if Simms wrote the "Advertisement" for the second edition of Martin Faber in 1836, as seems probable, "about seven years ago" pinpoints the 1829 publication of the "Confessions of a Murderer"; (2) the statement that the "Confessions" filled "some eight or ten pages" is erroneous in its estimate of pages, but Simms may have confused columns with pages (the "Confessions" occupies eight columns on four two-column pages); (3) the dates given for the "elaboration" of the sketchy "Confessions" into a full-length Martin Faber are confirmed in Simms's Letters 6 ; and (4) Simms is right in saying that the "sterner, darker features . . . nearly all appear in the story as it was first given to the public"—that is, the character William Harding and "the softening and gentler features" were added as "the fruit of an after labour." In brief, although differences between the "Confessions of a Murderer" and Martin Faber are great enough that they should be considered separate stories, there can be no doubt that Simms used the early SLG sketch as the germ for his first book of fiction. This genesis is apparent in language as well as in plot, as a comparison of the opening paragraph in the "Confessions" with a similar early paragraph in Martin Faber reveals: "Confessions of Murderer" I was born in an obscure country village in D___; the place had not more than ten or twelve families, and that of my parents was one of the most intelligent and respectable. The village was one of that class which is never known to vary its position; it neither increased nor diminished, and my father was one of the principal, if not the only principal man in it. Would he had been less so. Had he thought more of his own and the business of his own family and less of those around, I should not this day recount the history of my own disgrace. But my father was the great man, the lion of the village, and I became no less so of my mama's fireside. I was a spoiled boy even before I could read—so early are the principles of the human mind subject to misdirection. I was perverse, unruly and puerile, and my father mended the matter very considerably by damning at me on all warrantable occasions. To him and to my mother, I charge my crime and its punishment, and while they are wondering how so bad a scion should spring from so good a stock, they have been weaving the rope about my neck. I shall render amends to the laws of the land; they are accountable to God, and to his mercies I leave them (n.s., I, 266). Martin Faber (1833) My name is Martin Faber. I am of good family—of German extraction— the only son. I was born in M___ village, and my parents were recognized as among the first in respectability and fortune of the place. The village was small—numbering some sixty families; and with a naturally strong and shrewd, and a somewhat improved mind, my father, Nicholas Faber, became the first man in it. The village of M___, was one of those that always keep stationary. The prospect was slight, therefore, of our family declining in influence. My father, on the contrary, grew every day stronger in the estimation of the people. He was their oracle—their counsellor—his word was law, and there were no rival pretensions set up in opposition to his supremacy. Would this had been less the case! Had Nicholas Faber been more his own, than the creature of others, Martin, his son, had not now obliterated all the good impressions of his family, and been called upon, not only to recount his disgrace and crime, but to pay its penalties. Had he bestowed more of his time in the regulation of his household, and less upon public affairs, the numberless vicious propensities, strikingly marked in me from childhood up, had, most probably been sufficiently restrained. But why speak of this? As I have already said—it was written! (pp. 7-9) Though in rewriting, Simms has altered his phrasing to such an extent that a collation list for the two paragraphs is not possible, they both employ language recognizably Simmsian in tone and character. Masculinity and verve are earmarks of Simms's style as much as verbosity and artificiality; and perhaps one of the appeals of the "Confessions of a Murderer" is its straightforward narrative style relatively unmarred by redundancies and cumbersome rhetorical padding. The brief story is of interest for literary as well as bibliographical reasons in that it clearly suggests its author's skill and power of narration. If the "Confessions of a Murderer" furnished the germ for Martin Faber , is it in turn possible that the inspiration for the "Confessions" is to be found in earlier pages of SLG itself? Nine months before the publication of the "Confessions," "The Criminal, from the German of Schiller" appeared in SLG for February, 1829, and was concluded in a second installment in March. There are striking resemblances in the "Confessions of a Murderer" and "The Criminal" 7 : both are set in German country villages identified only by letter (D___) or by blank (___), not by full name; both trace the development of a young son through a childhood of petty crime to a manhood in which he commits murder; at the end of both the protagonists have been apprehended and await execution; and, perhaps most significant of all, both stories consist largely of the "confessions" of a murderer, narrated in first person. Then, too, the prefatory comments in "The Criminal, from the German of Schiller" emphasizing the importance of psychology in the story of crime are equally applicable to Simms's method and purpose: The hero must become as cold as the reader, or what is the same, he [the reader] must become acquainted with him before he acts; he must see him not only performing, but thinking his exploits. His thoughts concern us more than his actions, and the sources of those thoughts more than the effects of those actions (I, 288). In light of the scholarly attention focused on Simms's sources for Martin Faber , it is interesting to speculate whether Schiller's Der Verbrecher (via the translation in SLG and, ultimately perhaps, the "Confessions of a Murderer") is not a more logical candidate than, say, Godwin's Caleb Williams , which also has resemblances to Martin Faber and has been pointed to as the probable inspiration. 8 In carefully comparing the "Confessions" with the translated version of "The Criminal" in SLG , I find substantial support for the conclusion I had drawn before the recent discovery of the November 1, 1829, number: "the accumulated evidence leads one to believe that Simms had Schiller's story in mind and perhaps in hand when he sat down to write the 'Confessions of a Murderer.'" 9 In summary, then, it has now been confirmed that the twelfth number of the new or second series of SLG was issued on November 1, 1829, as scheduled; that the number does contain the "Confessions of a Murderer" as announced; that the "Confessions of a Murderer" is the genesis of Martin Faber as Simms had claimed; and that in turn "The Criminal, from the German of Schiller" very likely directly inspired Simms's undertaking the "Confessions." What yet remains a mystery is the Pleiades, and Southern Literary Gazette: was it indeed issued in early November, 1829, as the brief notice in the Charleston Courier of November 9 implies? I now believe that it was, and that some day a copy of it may also turn up. Simms's final editorial in SLG , entitled "L'ENVOY," clearly indicates that plans had been made for publishing the new journal: With our patrons we are about to part. We are about to lose our present character, good, bad, or (what is worse, perhaps,) indifferent, and assume one which may be considered partially, if not entirely new. Are there any regrets between us, gentle reader. Do we separate as those who have been long united.— As those who have been friends. Have we mutually benefitted or interested each other. Have we given you a moments pleasure or relief, and have you paid us in kind. These are questions which neither must answer. It may not be altogether proper, certainly not altogether delicate, to answer them. Let them remain. The present proprietor of the 'Southern Literary Gazette' having transferred his right in the publication in future to the Editor, and the latter having received proposals from Mr. Burges for an union of that work with 'The Pleiades,' lately projected by the latter gentleman, we now announce their formal betrothal under the longer title of 'The Pleiades' and Southern Literary Gazette.' The arrangements made for the publication of the work, from the encouragement afforded by a handsome and increasing list of subscribers, are of the most liberal kind. The paper will be of the most superior quality—the type new and handsome, the contents, in the selection of which, we shall have recourse to the most approved miscellanies, foreign and domestic will, of course, be highly admirable and interesting. A page will be devoted to music, selected and original, and by the devotion to whatever may interest, improve and delight them, we necessarily expect to win the ladies over to our support and interest. Here we conclude—we do not like to make promises and shall say no more. -----o----- The Editor begs leave, while he announces himself as the conductor of the work above projected, to acknowledge the kind indulgence of his patrons towards his previous labors. He feels grateful to those friends who have contributed occasionally to its pages hitherto, and solicits a continuance of their favors. Charleston. November 1, 1829. (n.s., I, 286).</field>

The known contributions by Simms to the twelfth number are listed below in the Appendix, and the reasons for their ascription noted. 4 See Appendix, "William Gilmore Simms and the Southern Literary Gazette ," pp. 88-91.

I have searched the notebook Simms labeled "Personal and Literary Memorials" now in the South Caroliniana Library and failed to find the passage Trent quotes; it is easily possible that Trent had material available to him that has since been lost. 6 See, for instance, the letters of November 13, 1832; January 19, 1833; and July 19, 1834; The Letters of William Gilmore Simms , ed.

      <field name="heading_text">Crane's Red Badge of Courage and Other 'Advance Copies' by Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The firm of D. Appleton &amp; Co. seems to have made a practice of supplying special copies of its books to English publishers for copyright purposes. The most familiar example is Stephen Crane's Maggie in the 1896 New York edition, noticed by Williams and Starrett in their Bibliography (pp. 25-26). A mint copy is preserved in the Barrett Collection in the University of Virginia Library (acquisition 551431) and a rebound copy in the British Museum (shelf mark 012628.g.64), spine and back wrapper wanting. The advance copies are bound in buff wrappers instead of cloth, and on the front wrapper (spine and back wrapper are blank) appears the New York title-page in its gothic-type setting except that no imprint is present. Instead, in purple ink the rubber-stamp imprint appears: 'WM. HEINEMANN, | PUBLISHER, | 21, BEDFORD STREET, | LONDON, W.C.' The title-page is a cancel and on slightly coated wove paper, different from the regular stock, the cancellans reads: 'MAGGIE | A GIRL OF THE STREETS | BY | STEPHEN CRANE | AUTHOR OF | THE RED | BADGE OF | COURAGE | LONDON | WILLIAM HEINEMANN | 1896'. In both the Barrett and the British Museum copies the blank verso of the half-title reproduces in offset the gothic Appleton New York title-page complete. It is a characteristic of such advance copies found in England that associations with the United States are omitted. Thus the verso of the half-title is blank in the 1896 'advance' Maggie instead of containing the boxed advertisements of the regular printing. In addition, the regular preliminary gathering in 8's has been reimposed to omit the Appleton "Publisher's Note" found on 1 3 and thus is a gathering in 8's still but with a new preliminary blank leaf so that the half-title is p. iii instead of p. i, and so on. Finally, the last gathering in 8's which in the trade edition had consisted of pp. 155-158 ending the text, followed by six leaves of integral Appleton advertisements, has been reimposed to form a gathering in 2's omitting the advertisements. From certain signs in the Barrett copy it would appear that this 'advance' form was pulled as proofs, though on the standard wove book-paper, and not printed on the press like the trade sheets. It is worth mention that the British Museum copy is stamped June 8, 1896. Williams and Starrett are mistaken in assigning this date stamp to their no. 9, the 1896 Heinemann edition of Maggie , which was not deposited in the Museum, the special Appleton copy with Heinemann cancel title-page having served the purpose of copyright. Williams and Starrett notice the existence of a 'probable advance copy' of their no. 10, The Little Regiment published by Appleton in 1896, but no details are provided. The British Museum possesses a rebound example date-stamped October 30, 1896 (shelf mark 012601.i.30/17) with the original wrappers discarded, but fortunately the Bodleian Library deposit copy date-stamped November 13, 1896, preserves the once white plain paper wrappers (Fic.2712 e. 1328). The original front blank leaf is preserved, but the first leaf of the unsigned initial gathering in 8's is removed since it was the half-title with Appleton advertisements on the verso. The title is a cancel, on laid paper with vertical chainlines and the watermark 'Abbey Mills | Greenfield', thus proving that it was printed in England. This cancel reads: 'THE LITTLE REGIMENT | And Other Episodes of the American | Civil War | BY | STEPHEN CRANE | AUTHOR OF "THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE," | AND "MAGGIE" | LONDON | WILLIAM HEINEMANN | 1896'. The verso is blank. The final three leaves of integral Appleton advertisements (sigs. 13 6-8 ) have been cancelled. This special copy differs from that of Maggie in that it consists of the regular trade American sheets and so the leaves of American advertisements had to be cancelled, not removed by reimposition. Once again Williams and Starrett confuse the Museum deposit date by assigning it, wrongly, to their no. 12, the regular Heinemann edition which the Museum does not own. A trade New York edition of 1896 (no. 9) is date-stamped May 19, 1897 (shelf mark 012704.f.13). The Barrett Collection of the University of Virginia Library owns an example of this 'advance copy' of The Little Regiment in its original condition, with all leaves intact and the regular American title-page. Collation of this copy on the Hinman Machine against the Barrett copy of the regular first edition shows (a) unlike the 1896 Maggie this is composed of regularly printed sheets; (b) except for the most minor of batter variation these sheets are identical with those of the normal first edition and are of the same printing. The Appleton edition of The Third Violet in 1897 seems to have been prepared in a special edition but was not used, since the British Museum copy (not date-stamped) of the American edition (012704.f.33) is a regular trade copy and the Heinemann 1897 copy (also without date-stamp) is preserved there. The Bodleian Library, also, does not have a special copy. However, the Columbia University Libraries own a special copy (B812 C85.X2 1897) in plain buff wrappers lacking the preliminary unsigned leaf (which was conjugate with the pasted-down endpaper) and with the verso of the half-title blank instead of containing the Appleton advertisements of the trade edition. The top edges are not stained as in the trade edition. Presumably these are proofs on the wove book paper. Why this form of the book, manifestly designed for foreign copyright, was not sent abroad to Heinemann is not known. On the analogy of Maggie, The Little Regiment , and The Third Violet Williams and Starrett speculate that pre-publication copies of The Red Badge of Courage may exist. It is a pleasure to announce that they are indeed in existence both at the British Museum and Bodleian libraries where Heinemann used them as deposits for copyright. The British Museum copy (012706.k.21) has the date stamp September 27, 1895. It is printed on laid paper with horizontal chainlines and is bound in cream boards, the spine plain dark-brown cloth, and the back cover blank. The front cover is printed with the same typesetting as is used for the title-page, which is a slightly coated wove-paper cancel, without decorations. This unique title reads: 'THE RED BADGE | OF COURAGE | An Episode of the American Civil Mar | BY | STEPHEN CRANE | [Appleton device] | NEW YORK | D. APPLETON AND COMPANY | 1895.' The copyright notices on the verso appear to be in the same typesetting as those on the title-page verso of the trade edition. The final gathering in 8's has been reimposed to 6's in order to remove the integral advertisements occupying 15 7-8 of the trade edition. In both the British Museum and Bodleian (Fic. 2712 f.272, date stamped on October 17, 1895) copies a rubber stamp prints in purple above the Appleton imprint, 'LONDON &amp;'. These special copies are presumably pulled proof on the regular book paper used for the first printing. The Bodleian copy differs from the British Museum in one most interesting way since it is bound in cream-colored paper wrappers instead of cream boards but with the same title printed on the front cover. Several points are of immediate significance. First, the title-leaf of these two special copies is a cancel but exhibits a unique typesetting not previously known. Since the title-leaf of the American trade edition is also a cancel, the original title is still to find. Second, these special copies give us the incontrovertibly first state of the type by which to check all American trade printings. Its characteristics appear to coincide with those of the Library of Congress deposit copy with the perfect type on page 225. Third, instead of light brown coated endpapers of the trade edition, the British Museum copy has white wove endpapers conjugate with the flyleaves. Fourth, the British Museum copy contains a number of small changes in pencil that seem to have been editorially made in preparation for the first Heinemann edition. It is possible, therefore, that this deposit copy may have served as the printer's copy for the English first edition although no signs exist of handling in the print shop, and so it may be that another copy was prepared for the printer from it. The variants in two other Crane books found in England may be noted. The first is minor. Both the British Museum and the London Library copies (the latter rebound) of the Heinemann Open Boat of 1898 lack the bound-in publisher's advertisements mentioned in Williams and Starrett. The second is more important and is not recorded by Williams and Starrett. In both the British Museum (shelf mark 012707.a.22, date-stamped November 12, 1903) and Bodleian (2561 e.2090) copies of the Stokes New York first edition of The O'Ruddy in 1903, the title-page has a paste-over slip on the lower part of the title-page starting with the line ' With frontispiece by ' and continuing to obscure the American imprint. Actually, in the Bodleian copy this pasteover slip is in two parts: the original slip covered the ornament and imprint, and then another was added to cover the frontispiece notice. On the lower slip appears the imprint 'METHUEN &amp; CO. | 36 ESSEX STREET W.C. | LONDON' in a different setting from the Methuen imprint in the English 1904 edition. On the verso of the title-page the copyright notice is left intact but the line 'Published in October, 1903' has been scraped out. The frontispiece is wanting in both copies. The Williams and Starrett collation for the Stokes edition is faulty, since instead of being [1-22] 8 as described it is in fact 1-22 8 23 4 , with the third leaf of the gatherings carrying the signature. What may or may not be a binding variant exists between the British Museum and Bodleian copies. The British Museum is bound in light-brown paper pasted over dark-brown boards with a plain dark-brown cloth spine. On the other hand, the Bodleian copy is bound in greenish-gray plain paper wrappers. Since other Crane wrappered items rebound in the British Museum collection indicate that the wrappers were preserved in the rebinding only if something was printed on them (as the front cover of Maggie ), it seems probable that the Bodleian preserves the original wrapper binding and the British Museum copy has been rebound. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that the copy in the Barrett Collection at the University of Virginia has the same wrappers as the Bodleian, although its title-page is not altered by a cancel slip. 1</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Scholarship and Mere Artifacts: The British and Empire Publications of Stephen Crane by Matthew J. Bruccoli and Joseph Katz</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bibliographers and the scholars who rely on them have for the most part slighted the West-to-East transatlantic migration of American literature. In failing to discover the facts about the publication, distribution, and reception of American literature in the English-reading world, these researchers have not only cut themselves off from usable evidence about the influence of American literature — they have also deprived themselves of crucial information about those American authors whose careers were largely shaped by their success abroad. Stephen Crane's British and Empire publications offer an eloquent case in point. Crane exiled himself in England during his most productive years, laboring to build not just a British following but, like Henry James and other American writers, a career in another country. He achieved prominence as a novelist with the publication of The Red Badge of Courage in 1895; he died in 1900. From 1897 on — two-thirds of his major career — he was headquartered in England. Perhaps he chose to live in that country in part because he had a congenial publisher there: William Heinemann distributed nine titles by him, more than did any American publisher. But there have been four Stephen Crane bibliographies, 1 three biographies, 2 and four book-length studies 3 — one of them a study of Stephen Crane in England — and yet there is no adequate indication of the realities of Crane's literary position in England and the British Empire. The following is an inventory of unrecorded information about Stephen Crane's British books. It is not intended as definitive in this area of Crane bibliography; only incidentally is it presented as a contribution to that bibliography. It is intended primarily to fill in the picture of the artifacts by which Crane was represented to his readers by his publishers, simply as the source material for a discussion of some important ways a working scholar can use the results of bibliographical investigation to construct a sound and thorough consideration of an author's career — if by only raising questions about assumptions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I On 13 April 1942, Mr. Brett of William Heinemann, Ltd. wrote to Ames W. Williams in response to his request for the publishing history of the books by Stephen Crane published by that firm. 4 Brett reported that Heinemann's "file copies are missing as are some of our records," so that although he attached "herewith a list of details which I have made as complete as possible" he "had to rely on memory for some of the items, because the records have gone." About The Red Badge of Courage , Brett notes: "First published November 26th 1895, in Heinemann's Pioneer Series, Green cloth, also in paper covers. Five more impressions done during Jan-Feb 1896. 6d edition, July 1900, 3/6 edition April 1925. The first edition was undoubtedly issued in 1895. If your copy dated 1896 has no indication on the back of the title page that it is a reprint, it is possible but I do not think probable, that the first edition was dated 1896." Of course the first printing was dated 1896. And we have located copies of two of the five reprintings mentioned by Brett: both Bruccoli and Katz have clothbound copies which call themselves "Second Edition" and "Fourth Edition." In the first printing the sheets are .009+” thick. In the "second edition" — the probable second printing — the sheets are .008” thick; the copyright page reads " First Edition, November 1895 "; and tipped in preceding the half-title is a list of notices for The Red Badge of Courage , separately paged [1]-2. In the "fourth edition" — the probable fourth printing — the sheets are .009” thick; the copyright page reads " First Edition, November 1895 / Second Edition , January 1896 "; and the list of notices is present. 5 In 1900 Heinemann published a new 6d edition of The Red Badge of Courage , in pictorial wrappers, described below with Pictures of War . For George's Mother — which was first published by Edward Arnold — Brett has no definite information: "Sorry, but I can find no records. It was a small book, done, I believe in a 7d cloth edition and was possibly one of the stories in 'BOWERY TALES'." Bruccoli and Katz have copies of a 1915 Heinemann publication in the "Sevenpenny Net Novels" series. Brett states only that Maggie: A Child of the Streets was "Published September 11th 1896. A small volume bound in dark blue cloth with gold lettering back and side. No reprints." Williams and Starrett list reprints, including: "London: William Heinemann, [1915]." Bruccoli has a copy in the "Sevenpenny Net Novels" series, uniform with a reprint of George's Mother , dated 1915 on its title page. The Little Regiment , Brett notes, was "Published February 6th 1897, in Heinemann's Pioneer Series, Green cloth, also in paper covers. No reprints." The Clifton Waller Barrett Collection, University of Virginia, has a copy in orange cloth which further differs from the standard format in lacking the pictorial front wrapper that was bound into the green cloth copies. This orange cloth binding is a Heinemann binding, not a custom rebinding. A reprint of The Little Regiment is described below, with Pictures of War . Brett indicates that The Third Violet was "Published May 6th 1897. also a Colonial Edition; Red cloth and in paper covers A new binding of the ordinary edition June 1900 (designed by the artist William Nicholson) No reprints." We have not yet located copies of either the "Colonial Edition" or the 1900 binding. On The Open Boat Brett states "Published April 18th 1898. Also a Colonial edition. Red cloth and in paper covers. A new binding of the ordinary edition June 1900 (William Nicholson) No reprints." The Barrett collection has a copy of the wrappered "Colonial edition"; we have not yet located a copy in red cloth. In the Barrett collection there also is a copy in green S cloth which BAL #4080 identifies as representing the colonial edition, but the copy is not so marked. According to BAL , "The publishers report that this edition was 'published 20th April 1898. 1,500 copies. All bound. . . . It was our custom to bind some of the Colonial editions in paper and some in cloth and unfortunately we have no record as to how many of the 1,500 copies were bound in cloth and how many in paper'." BAL also notes a " Times Book Club Edition " in orange V cloth: "According to the publisher's records this issue was made up of the 575 unsold sheets of the first printing. The sheets were sold to the club March 20, 1906." Bruccoli has a copy in blue V cloth with the Times Book Club seal on the lower spine. Pictures of War , Brett says, was "Published July 13th 1898. Also a Colonial edition in cloth and paper. Ordinary edition cover design by William Nicholson, also a 7d cloth edition (records lost)" The wrappered "Colonial edition" is in the Columbia University Library; we have not yet located a cloth-bound copy. Williams and Starrett record a 1916 Heinemann Pictures of War . Bruccoli's copy is a new edition, part of "Heinemann's 1s. net Novels" series, and contains only the stories in The Little Regiment . (The first edition of Pictures of War included The Little Regiment stories and The Red Badge of Courage .) Both the Columbia University Library and Bruccoli have copies of The Red Badge of Courage in pictorial wrappers published by Heinemann in 1900 at 6d. The running title in this volume is 'PICTURES OF WAR,' and it is almost certain that this book was printed from the original plates of Pictures of War . Although War Is Kind was offered to Heinemann, as Brett states: "Half a dozen copies of the American Edition had a Heinemann Title page for purposes of Copyright. It was not published in England." Either Stephen or Cora Crane managed to get a Heinemann file copy of War Is Kind . It is now in the Columbia University Library, and it helps to clarify Brett's description. As we have noted in The Stephen Crane Newsletter , this book is a copy of the Stokes edition with the Heinemann imprint stamped on the title page. 6 By the time Active Service was completed on 13 May 1899, Crane was living at Brede Place. 7 One would therefore expect that, as was usual under such circumstances, an English edition would be set from the manuscript and that an American edition would be set from the English print. This was not the case with Active Service . In the Columbia University Library there survive a typescript and a partial proof for the Heinemann edition. The typescript has two versions of Chapter VI, a ribbon copy and a carbon copy. The proof includes both of these versions. Evidently the compositors setting the Heinemann edition reproduced the duplicated chapters from the typescript, but of course the duplication was caught before the book went to press. The version removed from the proof appears in the American edition published by Stokes. In the Stokes edition there are other, numerous differences from the text of the Heinemann edition. Clearly, the textual evidence is that each edition was set independently from a separate typescript; and the duplicate sixth chapter in the surviving typescript is a carbon of the script used by Stokes. Brett notes only that Active Service was "Published November 2nd 1899, also a Colonial edition cloth and paper. No reprints." Bruccoli has a copy from "Heinemann's Colonial Library of Popular Fiction" in red P cloth. This book is probably a new issue of the original sheets, with a special form of the preliminary matter as pp. [i-iv]. Page ii lists as uniform with this volume The Open Boat, The Third Violet , and Pictures of War . Katz has a copy of the London issue of Active Service that represents a separate publisher's binding. This copy is the same as the primary binding, but the sheets have been trimmed to 7 14/32” x 4¾” and the publisher's catalogue has been omitted. Both Bruccoli and Katz have copies of a Canadian printing from the American plates. The title page imprint is: "TORONTO : / WILLIAM BRIGGS. / 1899." The sheets in this impression are .005” thick, whereas the Stokes sheets are .006”. This Canadian printing is bound in the same style as the American, but it is stamped in red and green and has the Briggs imprint on the lower spine. For Bowery Tales Brett notes: "Published June 23rd 1900. Also a Colonial edition cloth and paper. No reprints." We have not yet located a copy of the "Colonial edition." Syracuse University Library and Bruccoli, however, have copies in blue V cloth with the Times Book Club seal on the spine. The title page is integral and reads: Bowery Tales / By/ Stephen Crane / Author of / "The Red Badge of Courage," etc. / London / William Heinemann / 1900 The title page of the trade issue is a cancel and reads: Bowery Tales / George's Mother / Maggie / By / Stephen Crane / Author of / "The Red Badge of Courage," etc. / London / William Heinemann / 1900 Since the Times Book Club was not organized until 1905, and their issue of Bowery Tales consists of remainder sheets, it is clear that the integral title page in their issue is in fact the original title page. The cancellation in the 1900 trade copies was for the purpose of indicating the contents on the title page of this omnibus volume. But by 1905 such extra work was not worth while — even assuming that the reprinted title pages were still available in 1905. We are fortunate in having seen Methuen's records for Wounds in the Rain . 8 There were two printings of 2500 and 1000 copies each. Apparently there was a colonial issue — in both cloth and wrappers — of the first printing. In 1905 650 cancel titles were printed, of which 300 were used for "1/- Novels" — that is, to convert unsold sheets into a cheap re-issue. We have not yet located a copy of the shilling re-issue. As we noted in The Stephen Crane Newsletter (I [Winter 1966], 3-4), Great Battles of the World was issued by Bell's Indian &amp; Colonial Library (London &amp; Bombay, 1901) in printed wrappers; and a copy in red T cloth is in the Barrett Collection. These copies probably represent a separate issue with new preliminary matter, rather than a fresh printing. That, as BAL #4096 suggests, some copies of Last Words were distributed by the Times Book Club is established by three copies trimmed to 7 3/32” x 4 13/16”, all with the Times Book Club label: blue-grey V cloth (Bruccoli); brown V cloth and red V cloth (Library of Congress). Last Words was also issued in "Bell's Indian &amp; Colonial Library" (London &amp; Bombay, 1902). The Bruccoli copy in printed wrappers appears to be a re-issue of the original sheets. This copy includes a catalogue that lists Great Battles and The Monster as part of the series. That these three titles were originally published in England by other firms and re-issued in "Bell's Indian &amp; Colonial Library" strongly suggests that the Bell series was a graveyard for unsold sheets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The length of the foregoing inventory of new information suggests an easy conclusion: available sources of information about Crane's British and Empire books are inadequate. As one investigates just this area of Crane scholarship in which the bibliographies are all markedly defective, textual anxieties arise. The rule is that every reprint must be suspected of introducing changes in its text — until collation resolves suspicion. How many such variants lurk in the texts of Crane's Empire books we do not yet know. We now can only reveal what we have discovered so far: that the unrecorded books do exist, that certainly there is evidence to believe that still more remain to be located, and that their author was writing in the country of their origin when many of them were printed. But if Stephen Crane's bibliographers have skimped an important aspect of his career, scholars generally have failed to make good use of what is available. As the color of Crane's life attracted attention, it often obscured the basic questions one asks about an author's career. Assumptions transmitted from the past have become traditions. Their apparent authority, received with little skepticism, seems frequently to have discouraged independent investigations that would have established quite contrary facts. As a result there has been distortion of Crane biography that in turn has led to distorted judgments on Crane's career as a professional author and, cumulatively, to distortion of an aspect of American literary history. For example, two beliefs are widely held about Stephen Crane in England: that he was very extravagant and very popular. Always, his staggering debts are used as evidence that he had a talent for spending: The Red Badge of Courage was a best-seller in England as well as the United States; one imagines that Crane's income from this book alone would have been substantial; therefore one concludes that he indulged either in shameful waste or heroic luxury. Again, the tradition is that Crane was warmly received by the English book-buyers. England had given The Red Badge of Courage its first great acclaim, many subsequent reviews were flattering, and the great number of titles by Crane published there showed frankly committed publishers. In fact, soon after Heinemann's publication of The Red Badge of Courage a partner in the firm wrote Crane a declaration of commitment to his career: My partner Mr. Heinemann has gone to Paris on business and so I have the pleasure of writing to you. We would like very cordially to express our appreciation of your book "The Red Badge of Courage" which we have purchased from Messrs Appleton Co. of New York. We think so highly of your work — of its actuality — virility + literary distinction that we have been very pleased to take special pains to place it prominently before the British public. I have sent about one hundred gratis copies to the leading literary men of this country, + have personally seen some of the principal London reviewers. I have called Mr. Sheldon's attention to some of the excellent reviews obtained already — Mr. Sheldon represents Messrs. Appleton over here. I hope in the January number of our review "The New Review" to have a special article by the Hon George Wyndham M P on the book. Mr. Wyndham is now secretary to Mr. A. J. Balfour the Leader of our House of Commons, served as a soldier in Her Majesty's Guards: he has also done very excellent literary work. I think there is no doubt the book will obtain the success it so eminently deserves + I have thus early made an opportunity to write you to say how pleased we are to be identified with your work. I hope we shall in the future have the privilege of publishing your books in this country, and if there is any way in which we can be of service to you over here I beg that you will not hesitate to let us know. 9 The figure of a Gatsbyesque Stephen Crane has been attractive, but it simply is not substantiated by facts recovered from the kinds of evidence on which a full, descriptive bibliography of Crane will rest. Not that one can question the success of The Red Badge of Courage : six printings within the first four months of English publication can only set that belief on a more solid base. It is the notion that Crane profited financially by that success which must be rejected. Because the contract he signed with Appleton makes no reference to the disposition of foreign rights to his novel, he evidently was at the mercy of the American house. 10 On 23 October 1895 Appleton sold the English rights to Heinemann for a flat payment of £35. Crane may not have shared in even this small amount: £20 reportedly (Stallman, Stephen Crane , p. 184) paid him by Heinemann is a trifle. And as there emerges a bibliographical pattern in which one must decide that Crane was little more than a one-book author at the English stalls, his debts must speak more of foolish optimism based on a personal succes d'estime than they do of prodigious squanderings. It is true that the Cranes lived beyond their means; but the point is that his current earnings were not substantial — they were spending money he hoped to earn. Studies of an author's reputation are traditionally based on patterns formed by reviews. But there are two serious flaws in this approach. Reviewers swim in schools. One must wonder how much of the warmth displayed by reviewers for The Red Badge of Courage was kindled by the attentions of an enthusiastic Sidney Pawling. In addition, the reception of a book must be indexed by the way it attracts the cash of buyers. And reviewers do not buy books — they get them, as Pawling indicates, "gratis." In the absence of a publisher's sales records, the most reliable indications of an author's reception must be bibliographical. For Stephen Crane those indications after The Red Badge of Courage now create a pattern of publication that progressively became less hopeful: modest sales, and eventual loss-cutting. Heinemann's critical judgment of their first Crane book had been borne out by its sales, so they evidently adopted Crane as a house author. With Copeland &amp; Day, the American publisher who had first distributed Crane's book of poems, they joined in a reprint of The Black Riders and Other Lines in 1896, and in November of that year they published a further reprinting under their own imprint. 11 This publication of a book of poems bound lavishly in leather speaks of speculation in futures. So does the Heinemann publication of Maggie that same year: W. D. Howells's preface and the attractive goldstamped blue binding show more investment than do the Appleton buckram and "Publisher's Note." The commitment comes through in the resolution of a problem both Appleton and Heinemann had with Crane at about this time. In May of 1896 George's Mother was published in America, and in June in England, under the imprint of Edward Arnold. Although he denied the charge, Crane had been "playing one house against another." It is a significant indicator of Appleton's and Heinemann's hopes for him that he was successful in his game: in July he wrote first to explain to Appleton that Arnold had appealed to his "avarice," then to confirm his support for Appleton's arrangement with Heinemann on future books. Appleton had purchased his support with a 5% boost in royalties. 12 The year 1896 was a big year for Crane's English books. It saw five of the six printings of The Red Badge of Courage in its first two months. Maggie and The Black Riders and Other Lines were published that year as well. And a preliminary page in Maggie advertised The Little Regiment — " Shortly ." But The Little Regiment was delayed in England until 6 February 1897, three and one-half months after the Appleton edition was deposited for copyright at both the Library of Congress and the British Museum. The delay is puzzling. In May, 1897, however, The Third Violet was published in England. Here the bad years begin. It is possible that, as Williams and Starrett surmise, copies of The Third Violet issued with a purple ribbon through the tan binding were attempts at dressing up a slow-moving book. If so, it did not work. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the presumption must be that the colonies normally were a dumping-ground for remainder sheets Presumably sheets of The Third Violet were available for the unlocated colonial rebinding three years later, after Crane's death. It is clear that the book did not sell well. Similar evidence that Crane's peak sales had passed is in the circumstances of The Open Boat and Other Stories the following year, 1898. By now Heinemann must have decided to hedge their bet through size. But twice the bulk of the American collection, and containing some of Crane's finest short fiction, the Heinemann publication still had sales below that which was anticipated. When Crane died two years later there were sufficient sheets to justify a new binding in the Nicholson style, and five years after that there were even enough then to make profitable their disposal to The Times Book Club. Pictures of War indicates that Heinemann's conception of Crane's relationship to them had changed. Obviously the book is an attempt at turning once-prized material to advantage in a cheaper market. Three months after The Open Boat had been published as an appeal to the British sense of commodities, Heinemann tried the appeal again. If Crane was remembered for The Red Badge of Courage , the collection of that novel with the Civil War tales of The Little Regiment should have been successful. Evidently it was not: the colonies had to be called on to take the remainder issue. By the time War Is Kind was offered to Heinemann in 1898 there was no question that they would do more than token publication for copyright purposes — six copies. Another novel, especially one based on the Greco-Turkish War, must have seemed like a more promising gamble to Heinemann, but that gamble failed and Active Service was sent to the colonies. Then Crane died. The death of an author as colorful as Stephen Crane gives obvious opportunities to a publisher with unsold stock in his warehouse. And Crane's steady decline after the legendary Christmas party at Brede in 1899 at which he hemorrhaged severely left few in doubt that his end would be soon. William Nicholson's design for the binding of Active Service was adapted to the purpose of making a "set" of unsold English Cranes: Active Service, The Third Violet, Pictures of War , and The Open Boat . Perhaps in anticipation of Crane's death, perhaps because they already owned Maggie and had just acquired the English rights to George's Mother , Heinemann published a pairing of the two slum novels as Bowery Tales , in the Nicholson binding eighteen days after Crane died. These strategems reduced the warehouse stock, some. But Bowery Tales itself went to the colonies. Six years later unsold sheets of it and The Open Boat went to The Times Book Club. The significance of these sales to The Times Book Club is not just that Heinemann still had sheets on hand in 1905-06; it is also that it required a decision on Heinemann's part to sell those sheets in order to cut their losses on Stephen Crane. We are in receipt of a personal communication from Mr. James Geibel, who is preparing a study of The Times Book Club, that gives perspective to the inclusion of Crane's books in the Club's list: The Times Book Club began a combined circulating library and discount selling operation in September, 1905. A complicated dispute about the discount sales of "net" books soon developed between the Club and the Publishers' Association, resulting in a general boycott of the Club by most publishers. It was effective enough to make the Club desperate for titles by the spring of 1906. However, the publishers appear to have limited the boycott to new, fast-moving titles — as evidenced by their extensive efforts to keep Murray's best-selling Letters of Queen Victoria from the Club. Soon it was forced to take whatever remainder copies and sheets the publishers were pleased to unload on a cornered buyer. This was the period during which the Club purchased Crane titles. The dispute was settled and the boycott lifted in 1907. The Times Book Club Catalogue for 1905 lists five Crane titles ( Great Battles of the World, Last Words, The Red Badge of Courage, Wounds in the Rain , and The O'Ruddy ), but the 1911 catalogue offers only Great Battles . 13 Perhaps the Club's interest in Crane diminished when better-selling items became available to it; or perhaps its other Crane books had been sold out during the six years. There is an equally significant indicator of Crane's fall from Heinemann's grace at this point. In July, 1900, the plates of Pictures of War were used to print cheap copies of The Red Badge of Courage which carried on their wrapper advertisements for cameras, boot polish, and "Harlene for the Hair." Five years after it had won England and William Heinemann, The Red Badge of Courage was reduced to this ignominy. Small wonder then that Heinemann could have seen little reason to compete with Methuen for Wounds in the Rain (September 1900); with Chapman &amp; Hall for Great Battles of the World (July 1901); or with Digby, Long for Last Words (May 1902). Crane's first English publishers probably could have foreseen the results: The Times Book Club had available to it remainders of Great Battles of the World and Last Words . The O'Ruddy might have surprised them with its comparative success: it required three printings in England. But given the ebb of Crane's reputation by 1903, one surmises that it was not Crane, but Robert Barr, his posthumous collaborator and a popular writer of adventure romances, whose name sold the novel. But the story of Stephen Crane in England is not one of steady decline. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he became marketable again, if only in the new cheap lines that publishers developed then. Perhaps war brought recollections of the area of fiction for which Crane had been most famous. In 1914 Hodder and Stoughton published a new edition of Great Battles of the World in "The Daily Telegraph War Books" series. And in 1916 Heinemann brought this Crane back with Pictures of War — really only The Little Regiment — in their 1s line. In 1915 they had resurrected another Crane with both Maggie and George's Mother in their 7d line. We break here, with Stephen Crane's reception on an upswing far different from the burst with which it had begun and after which it immediately declined. If its subsequent evolution is to be traced reliably, it must be done in this way — through the evidence of the forms in which he was published. For an eclectic scholar, as for a bibliographer, bibliographical evidence can prove to be the base on which to reconstruct an author's career. 14</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Ulysses Notebook VIII.A.5 at Buffalo by Phillip F. Herring *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1918 was a memorable year for James Joyce. War raged in Europe, but Joyce wore his neutrality with a flair, and like his Mr. Dooley Who is the man when all the gallant nations run to war Goes home to have his dinner by the very first cablecar And as he eats his cantelope contorts himself in mirth To read the blatant bulletins of the rulers of the earth? 1 he remained aloof from any controversy which did not affect him personally. True, in order to procure a transit visa to move his family from Trieste to the safety of Zürich, he had had to promise the Austrian authorities that he would remain neutral, 2 but this did not prevent him from waging his own litigious war against a British consular official over the price of a suit of clothes. Joyce had promised the British nothing. On the brighter side, the Little Review began the serial publication of Ulysses in March of 1918 (by 1920 half the book had appeared), and Joyce's play Exiles was published in both England and the United States on the 25th of May. A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man had already appeared. 3 It was in the previous summer that Joyce endured the first of a series of painful eye operations; from October until December of 1917 he was dodging the chill of Zürich in Locarno, a balmy resort which was not so balmy that year. He returned to Zürich with renewed passion for work, however, and took a flat at 38 Universitätstrasse. During the next few months he compiled the notebook for Ulysses which is published here for the first time. Notebook VIII.A.5 is listed in Bernard Gheerbrant, James Joyce : sa vie , son oeuvre , son rayonnement (1949) as item 72, and in John J. Slocum and Herbert Cahoon, A Bibliography of James Joyce (1953) as item E.12.d.iii. Now deposited in the Poetry Collection of the Lockwood Library at Buffalo, it is described in Peter Spielberg's James Joyce's Manuscripts and Letters at the University of Buffalo : A Catalogue (1962), pp. 164-165: Notebook , Joyce's hand in ink and pencil (except p. [27] which is in the hand of Jules de Vries). Title : "James Joyce / Universität Str. 38 / I", Joyce's hand in ink on oval white paper label, scalloped edges, pasted on front cover. Collation : Blue paper covers. 25 leaves of graph paper (last leaf torn from notebook), stapled: first 33 pages and last 3 pages written on; balance of notebook, 14 pages, blank. Pocket-sized notebook, 17.4 x 10.8 cm. Other Markings : "30" in pencil on left side of label on front cover — probably mark of stationer. Stamp of "The English Players* Zürich*" appears on p. [49] and twice on p. [50]. Many entries crossed through with red, blue, maroon, or orange crayon. 4 In Ulysses Joyce's creative process was one of continual accretion, expansion and elaboration of verbal and thematic material relevant to a particular episode. He researched his subject more like a pedantic scholar than a gifted writer, trusting his notes to suggest to him hitherto unforeseen possibilities for his art. Having already decided, for instance, to use Homer's Odyssey as a scaffold on which to build his novel, he made an intensive study of Homer, Homeric scholarship and Greek mythology. As he read, perhaps in the tranquility of the Zentralbibliothek Zürich, he noted down words, phrases and references which he thought would be of use to him. Joyce's friend Frank Budgen describes this process: In one of the richest pages of Ulysses Stephen, on the seashore, communing with himself and tentatively building with words, calls for his tablets . . . As far as concerns the need for tablets, the self-portrait was still like, only in Zürich Joyce was never without them. And they were not library slips, but little writing blocks specially made for the waistcoat pocket . . . The method of making a multitude of criss-cross notes in pencil was a strange one for a man whose sight was never good. A necessary adjunct to the method was a huge oblong magnifying glass. 5 With few exceptions, ideas or words which Joyce found useful in his rough notes were transferred to later drafts or notesheets; the original notes were then methodically scratched out with color pencils so that he would not reharvest them at a later date. Undeleted phrases cannot be dismissed as unimportant, however, for they too sometimes crop up in unexpected places. 6 Reading "Ithaca" one begins to doubt that the word "trivia" has any meaning as applied to the material out of which Ulysses was made; indeed the transformation of trivial into sublime is one of the most salient characteristics of Joyce's art. In 1918 Joyce was working on the Calypso, Lotus-Eaters, Hades, Aeolus and Lestrygonians episodes, though he made notes for later ones such as Oxen and Circe when he found useful material in his reading. Those for the later episodes were not usually entered directly into early drafts, but were transferred to a larger repository of information: the British Museum notesheets 7 (Add. MS. 49975). This manuscript consists of approximately ninety sides of rough notes on folded foolscap paper containing material relevant to the last seven episodes of Ulysses . Zürich notebook VIII.A.5 is distinct from the earlier Trieste and Pola notebooks 8 which influenced the Portrait , or the subsequently compiled British Museum notesheets, though Joyce's technique is much the same. The notes here, with some exceptions, were based on his reading and do not in themselves represent creative acts of stylistic or thematic importance. It is unlike the vast reservoir of diverse material which one finds crammed onto the notesheets for the simple reason that the later episodes are more complex in nature. Then, too, the relatively large handwriting one finds in VIII.A.5, often more approximate than precise, more closely resembles the Finnegans Wake notebooks than the Ulysses notesheets. (It is likely that Joyce was using a magnifying glass.) But, sloppy as it is, the handwriting here was meant for his own weak eyes, and one need but compare the facsimile reproduction of Giacomo Joyce to see how legible he could be when writing for others. This notebook is important both as a document pertinent to Joyce's creative process in Ulysses and in the study of his use of source books. Walton Litz, in his The Art of James Joyce (1961), was the first scholar to publish an extensive account of Joyce's art, but neither he nor anyone subsequently has presented detailed evidence of Joyce's use of source material in Ulysses . 9 A typical example of an important influence on Joyce which has never been properly explored is that of Victor Bérard, although Stuart Gilbert, writing under Joyce's guidance, did make much of Bérard in his explication of Ulysses . In fact a number of the Bérard notes in VIII.A.5 are also in the Gilbert book, which suggests that Gilbert either used the notebook or Joyce emphasized these ideas in their conversations. 10 Richard Ellmann, Joyce's latest biographer, also mentions Bérard: He came to know, at about this time [1917], the contention Victor Bérard first formulated about the beginning of the century, that the Odyssey had Semitic roots, and that all its place names were actual places, often detectable by finding a Hebrew word that closely resembled the Greek. This theory suited his own conception of Bloom as Ulysses. 11 Mary and Padraic Colum suggest that Joyce's regard for Bérard was reverential: In a recent book, Joyce and Shakespeare , the writer says, "One can almost hear Joyce chuckle as he casually tossed out a hint that Victor Bérard's The Phoenicians and the Odyssey might be interesting to investigate." But Joyce neither chuckled nor was casual when he talked about Bérard; he was deeply impressed — by this scholar's revelations as to the origin of the Odyssey , and when Bérard died he made a point of attending his funeral, and thought of his death as a great loss. Indeed, when Joyce wanted to pay an intimate friend an unusual compliment he presented him or her with a copy of Bérard's translation of the Odyssey : I have such a presentation copy at my elbow. 12 Bérard, who published his Les Phéniciens et l'Odyssée in 1902, appealed to Joyce for several reasons: Joyce had already decided to make his Odyssean counterpart a Jew: Bérard's philological approach to history would have been particularly interesting to the future author of Finnegans Wake ; and both were fascinated by racial parallels. (Joyce found the multiracial character of war-time Zürich especially conducive to his formulation of theories about racial correspondences between Jew, Greek and Irishman.) Bérard's book would also have been useful in that it provided pictures and detailed descriptions of Homeric places. He was reminded, for instance, that people were classified according to diet as well as language: thus the lotus-eaters, the sitophages and the ichthyophages. The direction of Joyce's thought here becomes apparent when one finds the textual equivalents for such phrases as "LB. — all eat it — all one family" and "Lotos — priest give it to any chap that came along." The original lotus-eaters were, according to Bérard, generous with their opium: the euphoria produced eliminated the necessity for laws or government — or even an army since invaders were often tamed by the generosity of what we might today call "flower children." But for Bloom, the lotus-eaters are the devout communicants in All Hallows' Church: Something like those mazzoth: it's that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes them feel happy. Lollipop. It does. Yes, bread of angels it's called. There's a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel. First communicants. Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I'm sure of that. Not so lonely. In our confraternity. . . . Blind faith. Safe in the arms of kingdom come. Lulls all pain ( Ulysses , p. 81). What Joyce is suggesting, of course, is that the Irish predilection for dreaming (and by implication such related characteristics as euphoria, inactivity and blind chauvinism) is caused by Ireland's intense Catholicism, the communion wafer (lotus) being the diet which unites them racially. On page 3 of the notebook are notes from Bérard which provided Joyce with the historical and philological justification for the parallels he draws and the symbolism he creates. Bérard says that in Africa there is a variety of lotus called "celtis" which is now acclimatized in Italy and, further, that for the Greeks "lotus" meant a prairie herb, a sort of shamrock (II, 102). Bloom, innocent observer in the scene above, is a Jew of sorts; "lotus" is from the Hebrew word "lot"; the symbolic racial trinity is complete. Unlike the case of Bérard, nobody to my knowledge has cited W. H. Roscher's Ausführliches Lexikon der Griechischen und Römischen Mythologie as a source for Joyce's knowledge of classical mythology and literature. This reference work must have attracted Joyce because it contains exhaustive information on the properties and characteristics of all the men and gods in Homer. I have explored the importance of Roscher as the source for Joyce's notes on the post-Homeric version of the unfaithful Penelope 13 and will not repeat myself except to say that we need not be satisfied with a simplistic view of Molly as "ironic" counterpart to Homer's faithful Penelope. Joyce's notes on Hades out of Roscher reveal his continual search for parallels between the Greek world of Homer and Dublin of 1904, parallels which were admittedly more significant to Joyce than to most of his readers. In his elaborate diagram 14 for the eighteen episodes of Ulysses, Joyce noted the following character correspondences for "Hades": Cunningham -- Sisyphus Daniel O'Connell -- Hercules Father Coffey -- Cerberus Dignam -- Elpenor Caretaker -- Hades Parnell -- Agamemnon; Ajax He did not, of course, provide an answer to the identity of the Man in the Macintosh, who remains one of the most tantalizing mysteries in Joyce scholarship. Assuming that he has an identity, is more than Joyce's own private joke, there is perhaps a clue to his identity in notebook VIII.A.5. On pages 26-29 of the notebook is a list of some of Hades' characteristics; the German word "Tarnkappe" appears, which Roscher uses to compare Hades' cloak of invisibility with that of Nordic mythology. Joyce's mystery man has two prominent characteristics: his macintosh and his elusiveness. This evidence suggests that both the caretaker John O'Connell and the Man in the Macintosh are avatars of Hades. 15 I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility. ( Ulysses , p. 10) There is further support for this theory in the text: Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads. Twelve. I'm thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death's number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn't in the chapel, that I'll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen ( Ulysses , p. 110). This is perhaps not conclusive proof that M'Intosh is Hades, but the word "Tarnkappe" may very well have suggested this hoax to Joyce. The plays of Thomas Otway probably interested Joyce because of the profusion of Restoration slang words (such as blub lips , fubsy , and birdsnies ), though Otway's frank treatment of sex and cuckoldry may have appealed to him as well. On page 16 of the notebook is a library call number which I am convinced refers to the exact copy of the plays which Joyce used. The two volume Plays of Thomas Otway is an issue on the order of the 1736 edition with separate title pages and dates for each of the plays. (The Zentralbibliothek Zürich kindly sent these volumes for my examination.) It is disappointing that while there are pencil marks throughout, there are no notes in Joyce's (or anyone else's) handwriting. The only source book Joyce copied from in notebook VIII.A.5 which I was unable to find is a book on rhetoric and prosody (pp. 23-24). The examples of parison, paromoeon and paromology (p. 24) appear under their appropriate entries in the Oxford English Dictionary , but Joyce most likely copied them out of another source. Perhaps some reader will be luckier than I have been in pinning this one down. The edition which follows conforms in most respects to the critical edition of Joyce's notesheets for Ulysses which I am currently preparing for publication in book form, except that page references here are in the right margin (in italics) instead of immediately following the word or phrase, and the 1961 edition of Ulysses has been used. PARENTHESES, preceded by COLOR INDICATORS (B = blue, R = red, L = lavender) show the portion of a phrase marked through in color pencil, and, generally, what Joyce found most interesting. BRACKETS have been substituted for Joyce's own parentheses. QUESTION MARKS preceding a word indicate doubtful readings or guesses on the part of the editor; those which follow a word are Joyce's. ELLIPSES indicate an illegible word omitted. Joyce's interpolations are in smaller elevated type (e.g. "children teeth set on edge"). FOOTNOTES following the edition have been kept to a minimum and, with a few exceptions, interpretive notes have been omitted entirely under the assumption that the interested reader will refer to the source books where possible. The lines which cross the pages at various points are Joyce's. All of his notes here are in pencil except for the first half of page 1 (down to E. Curtius). I have separated run-together words and phrases where confusion could otherwise occur; those interested in more exact details will, of course, need to consult the original manuscript. It must be admitted that the incorporation of paraphernalia onto the page transcribed results in something of an eyesore, but it eliminates literally hundreds of additional footnotes and is ultimately in the reader's interest. Errors undoubtedly remain in my transcription, but I do not believe them to be many or significant. It is hoped that this introduction and edition will open the way for a more thorough critical evaluation of notebook VIII.A.5 as one of the designs woven into the tapestry of Ulysses .</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Meaning of Copy-Text by Paul Baender *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the past two decades the word copy-text has become standard in editorial nomenclature. Whether we take up editions of medieval works or of works from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries, we may expect to find the word copy-text in the editors' introductions, usually in the crucial place where they state what texts are the basis for their own and by what principles they have emended them. So common is the usage, and as a result so official the word appears, one is uneasy about the few recent editions that do not use it — that use instead expressions like "textual basis" and "basic text." Where have these people been, one wonders, and are they ignorant of the word? On the other hand one is comfortable with those who use it. They are informed, they are sound, surely their work can be trusted. More often than not it can be trusted, at least in principle, for in recent years there has been a wide diffusion of sensible editorial procedures, attendant upon a remarkable boom in the projection of new editions. But it is time to re-examine the word copy-text. The boom in editions has led to its general use, and general use has made it ambiguous and misleading. There is often no ambiguity, or any that matters, in the two most common meanings of copy-text. Sometimes it clearly means printer's copy, as when Donald F. Bond says that "for most of the [ Spectator ] the copy-text used by 12mo is the printed 8vo sheets"; 1 or when Robert E. Scholes says that James Joyce "obtained a set of proofs [of Dubliners ] which became the copy-text for Grant Richards' printer"; 2 or when Michael Shugrue says that the "copy-text for the present edition of The Recruiting Officer is a first quarto edition [ sic ], now in the Yale University Library." 3 At other times copy-text means entire editions that serve as basic texts, presumably after due assessment of press variants and other discrepancies among all extant or representative copies. Such is Lloyd E. Berry's usage: "The copy text for each work [of Giles Fletcher, the elder] is the first edition"; 4 and the usage of Brian Morris and Eleanor Withington: "The copy-text for the present edition [of John Cleveland] is the first edition of 1647 . . . for all the poems it contains." 5 Copy-text as printer's copy and as basic text are not necessarily incompatible meanings, and they may in effect mean the same thing. For instance when an editor chooses a certain book from which to take xerox sheets for printer's copy, but then inscribes on them variants appearing in other specimens of the same edition and even in different editions, he can legitimately say that the particular book is copy-text (i.e., printer's copy) or that the edition is copy-text (i.e., basic text). These usages would conflict only if two men disagreed over the same editorial choice — one claiming that a particular book should be the authoritative text as well as printer's copy, to the exclusion of variants in specimens from whatever edition; the other following the more familiar principle of eclectic texts. But even here there would be no ambiguity as to the word copy-text; there would instead be a quarrel as to which judgment, and consequently which meaning (only one, not both), was appropriate to the situation. But ambiguity has arisen nonetheless, and for two main reasons. One is the prestige that copy-text has acquired. Often it seems to imply authority beyond its denotation, as though the term itself ratified an editor's choice of text. This is one's feeling especially in cases where editors state merely that X edition is copy-text and do not give a rationale for selecting and emending it. They seem to be revealing as incontestable fact that X edition is the "best text," better by far than any other edition, perhaps the best possible. They may not intend this impression, meaning rather that while X edition is the preponderate authority, it is all the same a point of departure for an eclectic operation. But the stature of copy-text in current usage makes the hypothetical edition sound as prestigious as the word is in our respect. And like all banner-words — such as nature, natural, reason, reasonable — this one tends toward the superlative no matter how qualified our respect. Another reason for ambiguity is that copy-text as word and notion is not suited to the full range and complexity of editorial problems. Let me give here two brief illustrations. Number one, suppose a case where four texts independently derive from a single original. Only the original is by the author in question, but it has been destroyed. The four derivatives are by unknown reporters of indeterminate accuracy. Each apparently has as many authoritative readings as the others, yet those of all four are often different. Whatever an editor facing this situation chooses to do, he can hardly use the word copy-text as basic text or best text without being misleading. If he arbitrarily reproduces one of the four and calls it his copy-text, he misrepresents its stature vis-a-vis the others, which seem no less authoritative. If he reproduces all four he has no copy-text, unless the term is no longer to distinguish among texts. If he produces a conflation he has no copy-text in an honorific sense, unless he is so vain as to identify his own typescript in this way. Number two, suppose a case where there are two editions of a book for which no manuscript survives. The second edition contains many extensive revisions indisputably authorial, but since the book was electroplated when first set, accidental variants occur only in pages reset and replated because of substantive revision. To avoid the awkward procedure of inserting the authoritative second-edition readings in a reproduction of the first, the modern editor of this book uses xerox sheets of the second edition as printer's copy, restoring first-edition accidentals in the reset pages where he thinks they have been corrupted. Is the second edition therefore copy-text? One might think so, but the editor says it is the first edition, on the principle that the earliest text has authority where accidentals are in dispute. As a result the first edition sounds better than the edition used as printer's copy, yet each has its own authority. Clearly the word copy-text amounts to overkill as an expression of the special authority of the first edition. We must go back to the history of the word to understand how, despite its inadequacies, it has become a fixture in editorial usage. The history is familiar, and I shall not linger over the details. R. B. McKerrow invented the term in 1904, meaning by it at that time simply "the text used in each particular case as the basis of mine." 6 In his Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare (1939) he kept this meaning but proposed an eclectic method to accommodate authority in editions besides that of copy-text. 7 Ten years later W. W. Greg refined upon the method in "The Rationale of Copy-Text," a paper read before the English Institute and published the next year, 1950, in Studies in Bibliography . 8 In this great paper he drew his famous distinction between substantives and accidentals — substantives being "those readings that affect the author's meaning or the essence of his expression" (p. 21), and accidentals those readings that affect mainly its "formal presentation" ( id. ), such as spelling, punctuation and word-division. Greg agreed with McKerrow's later thinking in the Prolegomena that in general the earliest reliable printing should serve as copy-text and should control the accidentals, and he agreed also that substantive variants in later editions might replace copy-text readings. His main refinement upon McKerrow, aside from the naming and precise formulation of substantives and accidentals, was to introduce criteria for selecting among substantive variants. Greg's principles have saturated modern editors, both directly and through Fredson Bowers, who as early as 1950 began an advocacy of them which he has maintained on several occasions over the later years. These are the men chiefly responsible for the currency of copy-text, and one does not have to read far in them to see that the basic reason for it is the good sense of their editorial principles. But that is so far as the general currency is concerned; why they perpetuated it among themselves is another matter, and a matter of some curiosity. For there was a radical change of editorial premises from McKerrow's preface in The Works of Thomas Nashe to such a piece as Bowers's "Current Theories of Copy-Text." 9 Back in 1904 McKerrow was operating on a single-text or best-text assumption, and so copy-text was a perfectly legitimate coinage that meant in effect printer's copy as well as "the text used . . . as the basis of mine." But later, in Greg and Bowers, and even in McKerrow's Prolegomena , the word is kept though the principles have become eclectic. We may make a few common-sense guesses as to why they kept it. They may not have realized the full implication of their eclecticism, which in the long run rules out the designation of a single text, basic text, or copy-text when there is more than one text of substantive authority. Or, at least in the beginning of the new principles, they may have retained the word copy-text both to gauge their departure from the old and to preserve continuity. The reason with objective evidence to support it is that with respect to accidentals there still remained a single-text criterion. As Greg put it: "The true theory is, I contend, that the copy-text should govern (generally) in the matter of accidentals, but that the choice of substantive readings . . . lies altogether beyond the narrow principle of the copy-text" (p. 26). The belief behind this distinction was that the texture of accidentals in the earliest reliable printing would be closest to the author's and that variants in later editions would more often than not represent corruption. We may find the same distinction drawn in recent practice, for instance in the policy statements for the Centenary Hawthorne and the California Dryden. And so a word that starts out meaning one thing ends up meaning at times that thing still, but also something else. This aspect of the history helps explain the predicament outlined in my last illustration, where xeroxes of the second edition served as printer's copy though the first edition, because of its authority in accidentals, was called copy-text. The illustration has actually occurred. As a textual inspector sent out by the MLA's Center for Editions of American Authors, I have encountered the practice in two of three projects visited. The two did not have personnel in common, neither knew what the other was doing, each discovered the same expedient. The second instance was only slightly different from the one I have described. The work being edited existed in three most relevant forms: manuscript draft, first printing in periodical form, and first book printing. The manuscript could not be copy-text, for there were vast substantive discrepancies between it and the periodical version. On the other hand there were about three hundred substantive readings that first appeared in the book version. The editors decided to call the periodical version their copy-text, but they took xeroxes of the first book setting for printer's copy. Now I do not mean to criticize either project for acting in this way. On the contrary, their practice shows that they followed sound editorial procedure despite this convention of copy-text. One would hope, therefore, to find other projects making the same adjustment, and since I have found it in two out of only three, and since it was not necessary in the third, I suspect it has widely occurred already. And I suspect it will continue so long as the notion persists that there is a single form of a work which must be called copy-text because of its authority in accidentals. 10 If this notion were always justified we could not complain: the form with accidental authority would deserve distinction by some term or other, and copy-text would do as well as any. But the notion is by no means always justified, and Greg, the man who first stated it fully, never claimed it was. He confined his principles of substantives and accidentals to printed books of more than one setting, admitting that for works transmitted in manuscript circumstances might not warrant similar discriminations of authority. He also confined his principles to books whose pre-publication forms did not survive, and this restriction cannot be over-emphasized. For it helps us see that his preference for the accidentals of the earliest reliable printing was simply a prudential rule which fitted that circumstance and not necessarily others. Without a manuscript one could not know what the author's spelling and punctuation were, and so one could not know how often the copy-text represented them correctly. One had to choose among printed texts, which brought up the consideration that authors seldom changed accidentals even in revised editions but that compositors often changed them. The best solution under the circumstances was Greg's, for it would produce a texture of accidentals as close as one might hope to what the author intended. What Greg might have proposed concerning works with extant prepublication forms is a moot question. Bowers, who accepts his principles for the circumstances just described, thinks they also apply to these. When an author's manuscript survives, he argues, this becomes copy-text (i.e., accidental authority), which is to carry Greg's principle intact into the different situation. Bowers takes his supporting examples from Hawthorne. There are thousands of accidental variants between the manuscripts and first printings of The House of the Seven Gables , The Blithedale Romance and The Marble Faun , almost all of them initiated by the printer. Though Hawthorne accepted the changes, Bowers says we must restore the manuscript points because they were his manifest preference and because "the real flavor of Hawthorne, cumulatively developing in several thousand small distinctions, can be found only in the manuscript." 11 There is no disputing Bowers here. Obviously, if accidental changes are to house style or compositor's style, if they are indifferent choices, and if we do not know the author's wishes or his instructions to the printer, our judgment should tip in favor of the manuscript readings. But the survival of pre-publication forms does not in all cases merely add another stage for a retrogressive pursuit of copy-text. It is a question of what shape these forms are in and how faithfully the author wished them to be represented. Sometimes a surviving manuscript may be a rough draft which the author polished in later drafts that do not survive. The spelling and other points of the rough draft may be conveniently careless; for example, studded with abbreviations, lacking connectives, marked with dashes to be replaced at the author's leisure by more exact punctuation. At other times an author will accept — not acquiesce in but accept — accidental and even substantive changes introduced for one reason or another by typist, editor or compositor. Since the standardization of spelling and other formal matters some authors have meant publishers to style their manuscripts according to current usage, and so a writer may indulge in whatever mistakes and inconsistencies he pleases, expecting that someone whose job it is will clean them up. It is impossible to say in general how often these practices have occurred, and it may be difficult to decide whether a particular author has followed them. But the point is that they happen and that an editor must respect them. For the survival of pre-publication forms opens to him the most personal and idiosyncratic phase in the history of his text. Two cases will seldom be the same, three more rarely. An editor must determine so far as possible what in his case was the relation between pre-publication and printed forms, and he must be prepared to make a point by point assessment of variants, on the assumption that no rule may emerge for the sweeping authority of either form. He must also try to distinguish intention from oversight among the author's manuscript eccentricities, and he should choose the intention even if it means suppressing what Bowers calls the author's "real flavor." When we apply Greg's principles to printed texts we seek to recover what an author intended, and we adopt toward him an Arminian attitude: his wishes count for more than the corruptions that have happened to him. But the application of Greg to pre-publication forms can lead to an attitude of Calvinist rigor: an author's intentions may count for less than his mistakes and waywardness. If, then, Greg's principles are not equally appropriate in every textual situation, and in some not at all appropriate, his sense of the word copy-text should be restricted to where it belongs. But if this is so, we should drop the word and keep only the sense. For it can do no good, and has done harm by way of ambiguity and other mis-communication, to tie a word to a special condition, particularly when the word has different meanings in the same field of scholarship. Keeping Greg's sense, we need only say that when our option is among printed texts, the earliest reliable setting should be authoritative in accidentals and that an eclectic procedure should be adopted for substantives. Where is the necessity of copy-text or any other single word to express these principles? Is the accidental authority of the earliest reliable setting not clear enough in the statement that it is authoritative? When our option includes pre-publication forms as well as printed texts, again we need only describe the emergent authorities, such as they may be. But in this situation, where much more is known about the development of the text, determinations of authority should be through particulars rather than general rules. Thus, for Hawthorne, we might say that the kinds of accidental variants between manuscript and first printing suggest an imposition of house style and that the manuscript readings are consequently preferable. For another writer we might have to say something different; that the accidental variants suggest both house style and author's galley revision and that the present text makes its choices through a hopeful eclecticism. In situations like these, where so much is known, formulas and key words that signify formulas could lull us into a undiscriminating certitude. It is when little is known that our need is greatest for general rules, to keep our guesses logical. 12 So long as the word copy-text has a definite and consistent meaning there is no need to suppress it. At the outset I mentioned its two most common meanings in current usage, printer's copy and basic text, and I suggest that only one of them, printer's copy, is generally viable. Every edition of whatever work involves transmission of copy from editor to printer, whether typescript, book pages, photocopies of book pages, or some other form not yet devised. Thus copy-text in the sense of printer's copy could never be invidious. It would mean that version and physical form of text an editor chose to send his printer, and it would perform this designation as a simple matter of fact, without prejudice. If an editor prepared a typescript, for instance because of conflation or because the work survived only in manuscript, he would call it his copy-text. If he took xeroxes of a printing he would ideally choose the version easiest for a compositor to read and requiring the least emendation, and when no version fitted both conditions he would choose expediently between a clear printing that required many emendations and a vague one that required few. Nothing here precludes Greg's principles for selecting substantives and accidentals. Indeed a major advantage of copy-text as printer's copy is that it precludes no principles for the establishment of text because it is a function of none. Thus an editor would have to establish his text through principles relevant to his situation, and he would have to describe their bearing in detail: he could not rely upon a naming of copy-text to support doctrinaire procedures or to suggest a rationale he did not provide. But do we need copy-text as well as printer's copy, two expressions for the same thing, when because of past associations one of them may still imply a higher quality? Perhaps not, though it might be convenient to reserve copy-text for what an editor sends his printer and to use the other term only historically, to mean what an author sent his printer. If copy-text in this sense turns out to be superfluous, it had better be discarded altogether. A loaded word is particularly difficult to un-load when its neutral sense is not compelling, and so we might quickly end where we are now, with copy-text also meaning basic text, best text, and text authoritative in accidentals. A return to this usage, much less a continuation of it, would be a hindrance to precise editing. Principles and methods for the establishment of text are already complex, and with the increased application of statistics and computers they will become more sophisticated. There is also a growing sensitivity among editors to special circumstances that qualify general rules. For these reasons we must be alert to necessary changes in editorial vocabulary. We must be ready to invent new terms for new kinds of facts and formulas, at the same time keeping terms like substantive and accidental so long as they refer to discrete phenomena. We must be prepared also to redefine or abandon words that have lost general relevance and common meaning.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes * The abbreviations used here for periodicals are taken from the Modern Language Association of America Style Sheet. The compilers gratefully acknowledge the kindness of members of the Society in suggesting items for inclusion. The compiler of Part II is particularly indebted to Mr. J. S. G. Simmons and the contributors to Bibliography in Britain , from which he has added entries, especially for dissertations and articles in magazines of local history, distinguished by references to that source. The compilers strongly urge bibliographers and interested persons to send information on titles which should be included to them, and would be gratefully for authors' reprints or copies of publications to ensure their listing in this annual feature.
