      <field name="heading_text">The Orthography of Proper Names in Modern-spelling Editions of Shakespeare by Jürgen Schäfer</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In recent years the question of editions has received increasing scholarly attention and there is still discussion as to which type — old-spelling, modern-spelling, photographic, facsimile or diplomatic reprint — is most appropriate for Elizabethan drama, in particular for Shakespeare. 1 In spite of the debate there is little doubt that modernized editions are still the most widely used, both by the general reader and the literary critic, and will probably continue to be so, perhaps even after the publication of the Oxford Old-Spelling Shakespeare. In these editions there is still a tendency, however, to allow editorial tradition from Rowe to Clark and Wright to outweigh the results of the new bibliography; in consequence, the principle of "full" or "complete" modernization 2 which should be their raison d'être is often affected. Even if one considers only those texts which avoid archaic forms not recognized by the OED , it is striking that there remains at least one group of words, the historical and significant names, which is never consistently subjected to the principle of modernization nor to any other editorial principle. A careful survey of these names reveals that the present textual situation can only be understood as the incomplete application of modern editorial principles in conflict with editorial tradition. Within this limited group of words it is of particular interest to examine the effects actually achieved as a result of this conflict. In addition to the task of differentiating characters or places, the assigning of proper names in literary works has to take into account at least two further potential functions: historical identification and association. The function of historical identification may be attributed to all those names which exist beyond the literary work as historical realities and attain their fullest significance only in this connection, primarily the character and place-names 3 of Shakespeare's histories; the function of association belongs mainly to those names based on common nouns, significant names in the broadest sense, which are used especially for the minor characters of the comedies. In some cases the two functions may be intertwined as, for example, in Shakespeare's use of the historical place-name Venice to evoke among his contemporaries the idea of stern justice. Whether they occur frequently or only once, whether they figure prominently or occur in a side remark, historical and significant names always play an integral role in Shakespearean drama and cannot be neglected without some detriment to the reader's understanding. 4 If these names are to retain the important functions of identification and association in their original clarity, they should be modernized along with the text. The modernization of proper names constitutes a problem whose extent is amply demonstrated by the fact that no two of the scholarly editions which have been published since the Cambridge Edition agree which names should be modernized or what orthography they should have. 5 A century has passed since Clark and Wright finished their task, yet no subsequent editor has developed or consistently applied a comprehensive principle. It seems that the Cambridge editors themselves did not concentrate their attention on an area which perhaps appeared minor to them. But even if each of their decisions could be justified in the light of 19th-century scholarship, results obtained using the methods of the new — and the "newer" — bibliography make their policy in determining the spelling of proper names appear haphazard and arbitrary. Neither those few editors who have faithfully preserved the orthography of the Cambridge Edition nor the larger group who have tried to emancipate themselves from this towering influence present solutions which are convincing in all cases. Though the principle of complete modernization of historical place-names and significant names advocated in these pages may not find general approval, it seems necessary to examine a larger sample of the cases in detail so that the joint evidence may show the surprising degree of editorial diversity and the need to re-examine the problem on the basis of our present knowledge of the nature of the authoritative texts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I In the preface to the first edition of the Cambridge Shakespeare the editorial principles of William George Clark and William Aldis Wright in determining proper names are not mentioned but in the case of the group of historical place-names they can be established relatively easily. Over the centuries preceding editors had been following a general policy of gradually modernizing one historical name after another: as a rule each new edition retained those modernizations already documented and occasionally added a new form to the common stock. The Cambridge editors seem to have frozen the text at the stage they encountered; they neither returned to the old forms nor did they add any modernized ones. They retained, for example, the First Folio's Meisen , assumedly because nobody had modernized it, and also the uniform Poictiers introduced by Pope, which had not been revised by any subsequent editor, although the modern equivalents must have been familiar to the educated reader of their day. They accepted without comment the fact that the prosody is occasionally affected by modernization: following Rowe and Pope they changed the trisyllabic forms Marcellus and Marcellœ to the modern disyllabic Marseilles ; following Reed's revision of 1803 they changed the monosyllabic Roan to the disyllabic Rouen . It is important to note this freezing of the modernization process in the Cambridge Edition because a few decades later the movement of the preceding centuries towards modernization is reversed. In this century there have been a few attempts at modernizing such forms as Poictiers and Meisen , 6 but they have been more than offset by the tendency to return to copy-text forms. Two stages in this process can be distinguished. At the beginning of the century only modernized forms affecting the metre were discarded: Craig's Roan and Brigstocke's Marsellis (Arden, 1904) are the earliest examples. A second stage begins with Kittredge's Frankford and Harflew where the Elizabethan pronunciation is restored although the prosody as such is not affected. Editorial tendencies of this century are very different from those of preceding centuries since the attempts to re-introduce copy-text forms have neither been generally accepted by subsequent editors, nor have they attained more than an experimental stage in any given edition. The cumulative evidence, however, points to a marked tendency to return to copy-text forms based on a reconsideration of the intricate problems of Elizabethan pronunciation. That this new editorial attitude entails considerable difficulties should not be overlooked. Some of these are of a more practical nature, and there are some basic objections. It certainly is no light matter that the uniformity of names occurring in variant forms is put in jeopardy. Nor does it seem irrelevant that many of the resulting forms are meaningless to the modern reader without an explanatory footnote. It should also be taken into consideration that modern equivalents can offer the necessary flexibility in those cases where metrical demands might speak in favor of retaining copy-text forms. When the modern disyllabic Marseilles is used to replace the trisyllabic Elizabethan form, the use of a diacritical mark, for example, can restore the trisyllable which the metre requires. 7 If the demands of prosody can be satisfied by such an adaptation of modern orthography, the re-introduction of other Elizabethan forms hardly seems justifiable. Apart from these questions of detail it has to be emphasized that the practice of restoring the Elizabethan forms of place-names in an otherwise completely modernized text has not been carried out consistently by any editor, nor has each Elizabethan form found its champion. The basic problem is whether this practice of re-introducing archaic forms can be raised to a reasonable and working editorial principle. It is significant that editors have rather sporadically retained the one or other old form but seem to have avoided names which would put such a principle to the test, as, for example, those names with variant spellings. Contrary to modern usage Milan is usually stressed on the first syllable in Shakespeare, a pronunciation which might be indicated by retaining a form with double -ll- . Unfortunately, we find two Elizabethan variants in the authoritative texts: Millaine (TMP, TGV, ADO) 8 and Millane (JN). Omitting for a moment the possibility of modernization, four editorial choices present themselves: 1) exact reproduction of both forms, 2) retention of an "accepted" Elizabethan form, 3) retention of the form preferred by Shakespeare, 4) construction of a form that suggests the Elizabethan pronunciation to the modern reader, e.g. Millan . It is obvious that the second and third choices offer no real basis for solving the problem. There is no fixed Elizabethan orthography, a condition also obtaining for foreign toponyms, 9 and it is practically impossible to determine Shakespeare's spelling preference in this case, assuming that he had one. Millaine , the more frequent form, seems to be independent of compositor, a fact which might be interpreted as pointing to a Shakespearean preference; the same form, however, might simply reflect Ralph Crane's preference since he transcribed those plays in which Millaine occurs most often. The form Millane might have its origin in the foul papers of King John , but even this would provide an insufficient basis for determining a Shakespearean preference. The adoption of the first choice would be confusing and contrary to the general principle of making proper names uniform throughout the same modern-spelling edition. A synthetic form such as Millan might prove least exceptionable, but could create the erroneous impression of an authentic Elizabethan reading, quite apart from confusing the reader as to the identity of the place actually intended. Barring modernization it seems at best an open question whether a consistent editorial principle that is also textually satisfactory can be developed to cover the many possibilities. But even if such a principle could be evolved, it is still questionable whether place-names in their Elizabethan form are compatible with a text that is in other regards fully modernized. The argument of preserving Elizabethan pronunciation does not really seem cogent since in all other cases the phonetic development of the English language is carefully reflected. Such an argument also fails to take into account place-names whose Elizabethan orthography coincides with the modern but whose Elizabethan pronunciation was considerably different. It may be interesting for the historian of the English language that the name of the French harbor Harfleur was probably pronounced Harflew ; it should be no less interesting that the capital of the Imperium Romanum was apparently homophonous with room and that Shakespeare more than once bases a pun on this phonetic identity. For the modern reader the form Rome no longer reflects this identity, which, thus, goes unnoted in the modern edition. The retention of a few Elizabethan forms is apt to mislead the reader; even more serious is the undue prominence given to random samples of historical changes in pronunciation which can be profitably studied only within the context of an old-spelling edition. With historical place-names, therefore, the only feasible determinant would be whether an unmistakable identification is possible. That this question is still far from being settled in all cases was shown some years ago with the form Champaigne (1H6 1.1.60 F1) which many editors had understood as the province of Champagne and accordingly altered until A. S. Cairncross (New Arden) identified it on the basis of Shakespeare's sources as the town of Compiègne. If the identity of the historical place is beyond doubt, however, it is difficult to understand why the original forms should not be modernized in a modern-spelling edition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II In contrast to the treatment of historical place-names the guidelines used by Clark and Wright in handling significant names are more difficult to discern. Their treatment of these names may be called somewhat arbitrary even if one takes into account their general editorial policy of making the First Folio the basis of their text while regarding quarto forms and the alterations of subsequent folios, especially those of the Second, as readings with some authority. Under this policy many of the modernizations introduced into the tradition by their predecessors, notably Pope and Capell, were discarded again and replaced by readings from the quartos and folios. This process was not carried out consistently since quite a number of later modernizations were permitted to stand. The results are rather colorful. In some cases the folios eventually provide a completely modernized form which is then retained, e.g. Keepe-downe (MM Ff1-2), Keep-downe (F3), Keep down (F4), Keepdown (Cambridge). Frequently minor alterations are made silently in order to attain the modern form, but these take on an accidental character since they, too, are not consistently effected. A mute -e is often admitted or omitted, e.g. Ouer-don (MM F1), Over-don (Ff2-4) is changed to Overdone , Halfe-Canne (Ff1-2), Half(-)Canne (Ff3-4) to Half-can ; Dumbe (2H4 Q), however, is retained in its Elizabethan form. Consonants are sometimes doubled, e.g. Dogbery (ADO Q, Ff) is changed to Dogberry , but Belman (SHR Ff) is retained. A vowel may occasionally be altered without comment, as Sugersop (SHR Ff) is changed to Sugarsop , or the alteration may be justified in a textual note: Rebick (ROM Qq2-3, Ff3-4) or Rebicke (Ff1-2) is changed to Rebeck , following Rowe iii. Forms such as Ote(-) cake (ADO Q,Ff) and Sea(-)cole (ADO Q, Ff3-4), on the other hand, are retained. Since the New English Dictionary with its helpful listings of historic variants had not yet begun to appear, a certain inconsistency was perhaps inevitable at the time; in the light of modern textual advances it is certainly no longer defensible today. Editorial policy in subsequent editions has been marked by a general, though not unanimous, effort to modernize significant names. It seems that without a single exception modern editors have adopted all those forms modernized in the Cambridge edition; even those editors who continue to record faithfully the old forms retained in the Cambridge do not return to copy-text readings when Clark and Wright have happened to modernize them: the reader will look in vain for Rebick , Teare-sheet or Bul-calfe in modern-spelling editions of the 20th century. Here, however, the common policy ends. There is not only a distinction to be made between the conservatives and the far larger group of modernizers, it is also virtually impossible to find two editors who modernize the same names. Most remarkable is the fact that none of them has dared to carry out a consistent and complete modernization of significant names that were left in their Elizabethan or 18th-century dress a hundred years ago, 10 although in all cases substantial bibliographical evidence can be brought forward in favor of modernization, not to mention attempts prior to the Cambridge Edition which can be cited as precedents for most names. In pleading for complete modernization it is perhaps to the point to ask whether a graphic differentiation between a significant name and its corresponding common noun or adjective was intended by Shakespeare at all. The stylistic device in which the graphic appearance of a significant name is altered slightly while its phonetic identity remains untouched is particularly appropriate for modern English, and an array of modern literary characters passes in this thin disguise before the reader; in Dickens, for example, a broad procession (Airey, Buzfuz, Claypole, Dedlock) marches through the alphabet. It seems a mistake, however, to assume such an intention for Shakespeare. In the first place the use of this device requires a fixed orthography which did not then exist; second, such a device can only be conceived with a reading public in mind since its intellectual charm depends upon the reader's ability to see through the phonetic spelling. Consequently, an anachronistic 11 and inaccurate impression is produced in the modern reader's mind when he is confronted with significant names in their accidental Elizabethan dress, and this impression can only be heightened when an editor retains the proper name in its Elizabethan form but modernizes the corresponding common noun or adjective. More critical are those cases in which a modern reader not conversant with Elizabethan spelling peculiarities is misled with regard to the significance of the name either because its significant character is no longer recognizable or, even more serious, because the allusion seems to be to a completely different word in modern English. It has to be emphasized that the modernization of these names has nothing to do with emendation; on the contrary, one might well ask if the occasional retention of Elizabethan forms in an otherwise completely modernized text does not assume the nature of "passive" or "contextual" emendation. It may be asked further what authority the quarto and folio readings of significant names have and to what extent they can be expected to reflect authorial spelling. As far as "ordinary" words are concerned, we know that their spelling was largely a "compositorial prerogative"; a certain interference of the compositor's spelling preferences has to be assumed, no matter whether the printer's copy was a manuscript or a printed text. 12 Many other factors, such as the transcription by Ralph Crane, must be assumed to have already obscured the authorial spelling. There is some evidence that the forms of proper names were more carefully preserved on their way from the foul papers to the extant printed texts, but it is a question whether this also applies to significant names, which are, after all, capitalized common nouns or adjectives. 13 If there is no evidence to the contrary, it seems safe to assume that the significant names in Shakespeare owe their ultimate printed forms to many factors, not the least of which may be compositorial preference. In determining the significance of a name the modern editor is no longer restricted to the tools of literary and non-bibliographical textual criticism. In some cases bibliographical methods can contribute valuable independent evidence. The following criteria are considered to be decisive in establishing the actual meaning of an apparently significant name. In addition to the internal evidence all forms of the name in the early editions (Qq, F1) must be listed by the OED as Elizabethan variants for the common noun or adjective. They have further to be shown to coincide with the orthography of the corresponding common nouns or adjectives in the early texts if they occur there. Finally, the possibility of compositorial preference has to be investigated. 14 The significant character of several proper names which may have been doubtful on the basis of internal evidence alone can be established beyond reasonable doubt by reference to bibliographical methods; the meaning of many other names can be corroborated in this way. By combining all the available evidence the last impediments to modernization, doubts concerning the significance of certain names, can be removed. As has been mentioned, the need for modernization becomes especially critical when proper noun and common noun occur in the same Elizabethan spelling. Modernizing only the common noun produces a differentiation not intended by the author and may result in obscuring the significance of the name. In ADO, for example, the name Sea-cole occurs three times in the authoritative quarto as the name of the night watchman and the sexton (3.3.10, 12; 3.5.52); Dogberry's comment "God hath bless'd you with a good name" leaves no doubt as to the name's significance. The allusion is to coal imported by sea from Newcastle with its considerably higher heating value and price than the charcoal offered by colliers. The forms sea-cole and sea-coale seem to have been used interchangeably, and we find that in the Folio the name, which always occurs in long lines, has been changed to Sea-coale while the common noun continues to appear in the form sea-cole (WIV 1.4.8; 2H4 2.1.85&lt;Q1 sea cole ). Most editors have modernized the proper noun along with the common noun. The modernization of the parallel Ote-cake needs hardly to be discussed in detail since it also has been rather generally modernized. There are, however, at least two editions of this century which have modern Oatcake and Elizabethan Seacole side by side. As with Seacoal and Oatcake there seems to be no reason why Elizabethan forms should be retained for Dumb (2H4 2.4.83) and Turf (SHR Ind.2.92). The phonetic similarity remains unaffected when the variants Dumbe and Turph are used, though the modern reader will undoubtedly see an attempt at disguise where none exists in fact. Such an impression must certainly be expected in the case of the incongruous juxtaposition of Mistress Quickly's "Master Dumb, our minister" if the Dumbe variant is retained. In the case of Peter Turf it is difficult to see why any special importance should be attached to the obvious coincidence of the copy-text form: turph (LLL 4.2.84: D&lt;Q1 turph ; AYL 3.4.44: C; CYM 5.3.14: B) and turfe (MND 2.2.41: C&lt;Q2 turffe ; H5 4.1.14: A; HAM 4.5.31: B) are used throughout the Folio without recognizable distinction and occur with equal frequency. The graphic evidence should also be the determining factor in modernizing to Dizzy . The First Folio's Dizie (MM 4.3.11) is listed in the OED as an Elizabethan variant which is also used in the Folio for the adjective (LR 4.6.12). Both occurrences were set by Compositor B, who changed the Lear example from the Quarto's dizi . The other two instances of the adjective (1H6 4.7.11; TRO 5.2.172&lt;Q1 dizzy ) read dizzie and were set by Compositor A. 15 Though these four examples cannot be regarded as sufficient for determining compositorial preferences, there is at least the possibility that Dizie is Compositor B's preferred form and that the significance is indeed "dizzy". Semantically Dizzy may be understood either as "foolish, stupid" ( OED a .1) or "mentally or morally unsteady, giddy" ( OED a .4). There seems to be little support for the interpretation "gambler", a suggestion advanced in the New Arden, obviously in connection with Steevens' conjecture Dicey . The necessary prerequisite for this conclusion, i.e. that dize is an Elizabethan variant of dice , seems to be lacking: neither in the OED nor in the First Folio, where the form dice occurs eight times, dicers and dic'd each once, is a variant form with - z - to be found. In addition, the differentiation of the vowel sounds of dicey [ßi] and dizzy [i] at Shakespeare's time would preclude this double allusion. Such an interpretation is further weakened by the fact that Steevens' conjecture was apparently based on a misreading. 16 The retention of Belman (SHR Ind. 1.20; F1 short line), the name of a hound, offers an example of a form which tends to lead the modern reader astray since if there is an association, it is most likely to be with the French bel . The name, however, does not refer to the beauty of the animal but rather to the bell-like quality of its voice. Similar dogs' names are not infrequent in the Elizabethan period; in Shakespeare, for example, we find Ringwood (WIV 2.1.106), whose barking causes the wood to resound. An unquestionable reference to this connotation, strange perhaps nowadays, may be found in Theseus' words when he proudly refers to the euphony of his pack, "match'd in mouth like bells" (MND 4.1.120). In addition, the F1 distribution of variant spellings for the word bell supports the interpretation "bell-man". As a common noun the word in question occurs once in the Folio (MAC 2.2.3) and is spelled Bell-man by Compositor A; the form Belman , however, was set by Compositor B. There is only one parallel compound in Shakespeare, bell-wether , which is spelled Bel-/weather by Compositor B (AYL 3.2.71), though another compositor, probably A, uses the form Bell-weather (WIV 3.5.98). The noun "bell" shows a similar distribution of forms with one - l and with double - ll . The uninflected form reads bell , irrespective of compositor, but the plural form shows an interesting variation: Compositor A always uses the form with double - ll (1H6 1.6.11; 2H6 3.1.366; 3H6 1.1.47), whereas Compositor B exhibits a noticeable preference for the form bels , which he uses four times (AYL 2.7.114; 3.3.70; JN 2.1.312; HAM 3.1.158) as opposed to his use of belles (TN 5.1.34; 2H6 5.1.3) or bells (OTH 2.1.110). Both the internal and the typographical evidence in this case give equal support to the significance "bell-man" and to the consequent modernization of the copy-text form. Though the retention of old spellings in the above instances may produce an anachronistic impression of a conscious graphic distinction or may obscure the true significance of the name, the phonetic similarity remains unchanged. In contrast, the readings Shootie (F1) or Shooty (F2) will probably mislead the reader both graphically and phonetically. This significant name from Measure for Measure (4.3.15) presents one of the cases in which internal evidence alone (though this must have led Capell to suggest "Shoe-tie" originally) remains somewhat inconclusive, and additional criteria are necessary to establish the meaning beyond doubt. As Warburton's conjecture Shooter demonstrates, Pompey's reference to "braue Mr Shootie the great Traueller" gives rise to an association with bravado and shooting and may cause the reader to think of armed journeys. On the other hand, if braue is understood as "showy", Capell's suggestion Shoo-tye seems quite logical, particularly since there are many contemporary allusions to the extravagant foreign fashion of conspicuous shoe ornaments. It should also be noted that there is no parallel case in Shakespeare of a significant name derived from a verb in such a way. In considering the bibliographical evidence it is not sufficient that both shoo and tie are listed in the OED as seventeenth-century forms; the evidence of the First Folio has to be examined in detail. 17 The common noun occurs only once (WT 4.4.591) and is spelled Shooe-tye on a page set by Compositor A; the proper noun, however, was set by Compositor B. The preferred spelling of both Compositors A and B for the uninflected form of "(un)tie" is ( un)tye , 18 but Compositor B does use the form tie twice, one of these occurring on the same page as Shootie (G3a23). More important is the negative evidence that Compositor B "displays a consistently strong preference for the final -y form of all words [i.e. polysyllabic] which can vary between final -y and -ie ." 19 This preference would lead one to expect the spelling Shooty in a disyllabic word derived from "to shoot", not however Shootie . The spelling of the first syllable of the name is also revealing. The plural of "shoe", except for the obsolete form shoon , appears as shooes or shoes ; the uninflected form, noun and verb, always occurs in one of two variants: shooe , used eight times (TMP 3.2.22: B; TGV 2.3.13, 14, 14, 16, 22: C; LLL 1.2.159: C&lt;Q1 shoo ; H5 4.1.47: A), and shoo , used six times (ERR 3.2.101: B; MV 1.2.38: A or D&lt;Q1 shoo ; AYL 3.2.352: B; H5 4.7.137: B; HAM 2.2.229: C; LR 4.6.185: B&lt;Q1 shoot ). Of these last six examples four were set by Compositor B, who uses the form shooe only once in a justified line. B, thus, shows a preference for the form shoo which the other compositors do not seem to share. In the light of Elizabethan spelling habits it is, therefore, possible that Shootie means "shoe-tie"; the fact that the form was set by Compositor B makes this meaning plausible to the exclusion of the meaning "shooty". By combining the bibliographical with the internal evidence the meaning of the name can be reasonably well established, and there should be no hesitation about modernizing to Shoetie if the original sense is to be retained. 20 Another example of those forms which give neither graphic nor phonetic clues to their original significance is the name of Don Armado's page in Love's Labour's Lost . This name occurs four times in the text and once in the stage directions in the form Moth . It was Richard Grant White who first applied orthographic criteria and established that the significance of the name is actually "mote" since the corresponding common noun, modernized to mote by all editors, is also spelled moth in the quartos and the First Folio with the exception of H5 Q3 where the form moath appears; only the plural, used once, reads moats (PER Q1 4.4.21). Further, the copious allusions to the small stature of the page unmistakably point to this meaning. R. G. White's argumentation has been generally accepted, as explanatory and glossarial notes in several editions suggest; yet the necessary consequence, that the name should be modernized along with the common noun, has not yet been effected by a single editor — despite the widespread conviction that the traditional form no longer conveys the original Elizabethan sense. This curious phenomenon presents another aspect of 20th-century modernization policy. Of the significant names retained in their Elizabethan forms by Clark and Wright only unobtrusive ones have been modernized. All editors have avoided changes affecting a well-known character in a noticeable way, especially since this would also mean defying the tradition of the last two hundred and fifty years. 21 If a minor character is involved, there is not the same degree of hesitancy. An example is offered by the case of the elf in Midsummer Night's Dream with the same name as Armado's page: at least one editor has modernized to Mote though in an individual edition (Arden), thus sparing him from making the consequent change in Love's Labour's Lost . It is unfortunate that the impression of lightness, grace and minuteness which the significant name should convey in both of these instances is suggested to the modern reader by Moth rather than Mote and that the latter now seems to be inextricably connected with the biblical admonition. This change in connotative value may further explain the reluctance of editors to modernize this name though it is no secret that similar changes in connotation have affected many other words since Shakespeare's time. The fact that there is general scholarly agreement that Shakespeare intended Mote in both these plays should make modernization indispensable. The inconsistency of the prevalent policy becomes all too obvious when one considers that some editors would probably not hesitate to change both names to Mote if the Elizabethan form for both the insect and the particle did not happen to be identical with the modern form for the insect. Unlike those names already treated in which an initial ambiguity can be removed by applying external and internal evidence, there are some names whose significant character cannot be established beyond doubt, but even in the face of a certain ambivalence the traditional forms no longer seem justified in a modern edition. Proteus' servant in The Two Gentlemen of Verona and Bassanio's servant in The Merchant of Venice are good examples; their names are usually given as Launce and Launcelot . The former may be the Christian name "Lance", a short form for Lancelot, 22 or may signify "lance", the weapon or the surgical instrument (cf. OED sb. 1. &amp; 3). In order to retain this ambiguous nature the form should be modernized to Lance , which leaves the modern reader with the same choice as the original. The name of the servant in The Merchant of Venice presents a more difficult problem. The form Launcelot is Rowe's emendation; the authoritative text (Q1) has Launcelet throughout. 23 In Pavier's reprint of 1619 and in the First Folio, both of which were set from Q1, the name is spelled Launcelet and Lancelet . The form Lancelot does occur once (Q2 2.2.77), but it is more than overbalanced by the approximately ninety occurrences in Q1, Q2 and F1, all ending in - et ; it is, therefore, difficult not to regard this isolated instance in a derived text as a misprint. Not unlike Launce , the name may be significant and refer to the clownish witticisms of the character or it may be a contemporary variant of the Christian name Lancelot , 24 especially since it precedes the family name Iobbe . The exigencies of modern orthography, however, do not so happily coincide here as in the case of Launce/Lance , and a choice between Lancelet and Lancelot is necessary. The form Lancelot , which has been used in two modern editions, 25 precludes any allusion to "lancelet", whereas Lancelet is both closer to the copy-text form and will, in connection with the family name, undoubtedly also suggest "Lancelot". Either of these two modernized forms seems preferable to Rowe's Launcelot , which in modern usage refers exclusively to the hero of Arthurian legend, a questionable allusion in this case.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Editorial policy regarding historical place-names and significant names may go unnoticed when reading an individual play in a particular edition; on the basis of the cumulative evidence of a larger sample of names and editions, however, the surprising diversity and the changes in editorial attitudes become recognizable. From the authoritative texts to the editions of the last century an uninterrupted tradition of gradual modernization can be observed which comprises historical and significant names. The Cambridge Edition represents a turning point in this process. With historical names Clark and Wright preserved the stage of modernization which had already been attained; the twentieth century introduced the new tendency of returning to Elizabethan forms. With significant names the Cambridge editors restored a number of Elizabethan forms, both in cases where the meaning was obvious and in cases where the internal evidence was perhaps considered insufficient for a particular significance; twentieth-century editors have resumed the modernization process, taking the Cambridge readings as their starting point. In regard to both modernization and restoration, the practices of modern editors can be called at best experimental, at worst inconsistent. Each edition offers a different example of a compromise between editorial tradition and a partial reconsideration of the problem. No editor has consistently applied a recognizable principle; this is also true of those who simply preserve the Cambridge readings for they are on no safer ground. The inconsistency is the same whether a single editor or many (Arden, Yale) have prepared the texts. No two editions modernize or restore the same names. Three different editors may retain — in addition to the special cases of well-known characters — only three old forms, but the three names are never identical: W. J. Craig, for example, preserves Bede, Dizie, Dumbe ; Wilson has Belman, Dizie, Turph ; Sisson retains Belman, Dumbe, Turph . A similar phenomenon can be observed with place-names: Kittredge has Calais, Frankford, Harflew ; the New Arden reads Callice (only R2), Frankfort, Harfleur ; the Revised Yale offers Callice, Frankfort, Harflew . Modern-spelling editions have been termed "semi-popular" and it is obvious that they cannot provide the best text for the Shakespeare scholar. But they will always present the main access to the plays, both for the general reader and for many a serious student of literature. Those readers who prefer a modern-spelling edition deserve to be offered a scholarly text prepared in a way which enables them to grasp the Shakespearean meaning as fully and as directly as present-day orthography permits. In such a case the need for an editor to be faithful to his original cannot be understood as an exact replication of selected copy-text forms. Quite apart from the possibility that these may be accidental and not authorial, it must be taken into account that they change their nature in a modernized context and begin to convey impressions which no longer reflect the author's intentions. It may be tempting to preserve some Elizabethan flavor with at least the proper names, but this can only be done at the expense of clarity. The principle of full modernization, once embraced, has to be applied without exception since it is only this method, paradoxically enough, that is able to reflect the Shakespearean meaning within the new context. SURVEY OF READINGS In this survey the modern editions consulted are listed in the order of their dates of publication in order to indicate possible dependencies.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 See the article by John Russell Brown, "The Rationale of Old-Spelling Editions of the Plays of Shakespeare and his Contemporaries," Studies in Bibliography , XIII (1960), 49-67, and the rejoinder by Arthur Brown, ibid., pp. 69-76; see also Fredson Bowers, "Today's Shakespeare Texts and Tomorrow's," On Editing Shakespeare (1966), pp. 137-179. 2 Cf. Alice Walker, "Compositor Determination and Other Problems in Shakespearean Texts," Studies in Bibliography , VII (1955), 9, and Arthur Brown, "Editorial Problems in Shakespeare: Semi-Popular Editions," Studies in Bibliography , VIII (1956), 19. 3 Only place-names will be treated in the following as representative examples of this group. 4 See, for example, the interesting essay "What's in a Name?" in G. Wilson Knight's The Sovereign Flower (1958), pp. 161-201. 5 See the survey of editions at the end of this article. Line references are to the Third Cambridge Edition, 1891-1893. 6 Nobody has yet modernized the form Sala which occurs in the same context (H5 1.2.44, 51) to Saale , the affluent of the Elbe, though it is unmistakably identified as such by the reference to the March of Meissen, the territory between the Saale and the Elbe in medieval times. The basis for the original Holinshed passage linking the river Saale with the area subject to Salic Law is a popular etymology deriving the adjective "Salic" from this river. However obscure the origin of "Salic" has remained to the present day, there is no question that it was first used with reference to the area of the lower Rhine and has nothing to do with the Elbe affluent. It is perhaps best to leave the name in its First Folio form since this is not an Elizabethan variant but the medieval Latin name of the river Saale. 7 Cf. Dover Wilson's solution, AWW 4.4.9. 8 The form Millain documented once seems to be due to line justification (TGV 1.1.71). 9 In Thomas Kyd's The Housholders Philosophie (1588), for example, the additional forms Myllain and Mylain occur. In this connection one might also question the tendency of some editors to take into account the orthography of toponyms in Shakespeare's sources such as North and Holinshed since these forms are no less accidental than those of other Elizabethan texts. 10 This does not hold true for the hyphenation of significant names which has to be counted among the accidentals; see the Folio readings of the names in MM 4.3.1-19. George Lyman Kittredge seems to have been the first to discard hyphenation of these names altogether except for those cases which aim at a special effect, for example, Mock-water in WIV 2.3.51. Some editors have followed his example. 11 One of the earliest examples of this device is perhaps to be found in the anglicized version of Every Man in His Humour . The hyphenated names Downeright, Well-bred and Brayne-worme are not differentiated from their common adjectives or noun; Kno'well , however, is already slightly disguised, and the form looks surprisingly similar to the surname Knowell listed by C. W. Beardsley, A Dictionary of English and Welsh Surnames (1901), with a seventeenth-century occurrence. The important difference, of course, is that Jonson prepared this play very carefully for his folio edition of 1616 and, unlike Shakespeare, had a reading public in mind. 12 See Charlton Hinman, The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963), I, 180f., and T. H. Hill, "Spelling and the Bibliographer," The Library , 5th Series, XVIII (1963), 1-28. 13 If Hand D of Sir Thomas More is identified with Shakespeare, the case of Scilens in 2H4 furnishes a good example how an authorial spelling of a significant name disappears in the transmission of the text. Even in Qa the name does not always appear as Scilens ; several times it has been changed by the compositor, assuming homogenous authorial spelling, to Silens and Silence . On the pages of Qb all traces of the Sc- spelling have been removed, and F1, whatever the nature of Jaggard's copy, reads Silence throughout. The assumption that the spelling of significant names occurring only once or twice was even more subject to compositorial interference is strongly supported by the evidence of the later folios. 14 In the following Prof. Hinman's compositorial assignments are used. 15 The F2 reading Dizy has to be attributed to the general change in word endings on this page (Sig. G3); see below, footnote 20. 16 Steevens' note in the Variorum Edition of 1803 reads "The old copy has Dizey ." As mentioned above, F1 reads Dizie , Ff2-4 Dizy . Which "old copy" may have been intended does not become clear. 17 The New Arden editor considers part of the typographical evidence but makes no use of compositor analysis. 18 Compositor A: tye (TMP 5.1.253; AWW 1.3.171; R2 4.1.77; TRO 5.8.21&lt;Q1 tie ; COR 2.2.63); tie (TRO 2.3.98). Compositor B: tye (COR 3.1.314; MAC 3.1.17; 4.1.52; LR 4.2.14 &lt;Q1 tie ; ANT 2.1.23; 2.6.6, 117; CYM 3.7.15; 5.4.147; 1H4 1.2.171: B?); tie (MM 4.2.167; SHR 2.1.21). 19 William S. Kable, "The Influence of Justification on Spelling in Jaggard's Compositor B," Studies in Bibliography , XX (1967), 236. 20 Since many editors have retained F2 Shooty , it may be of interest to examine this text. The F2 compositor has rather consistently changed the - ie endings of Sig. G3 to - y , except for monosyllabic words ( tie &gt; tye a23, die &gt; dye b56, 59, 66.) We do not know why Shootie was not altered to Shootye , analogous to tye and dye . Perhaps the F2 compositor simply followed a mechanical analogy to other polysyllables in - ie or, less likely, may have made the change consciously since ty is a seventeenth-century variant of tie . Whatever his understanding of his predecessor's form may have been, Shooty is a derived reading without authority. 21 The same reluctance can be observed with the name of Falstaff's filching retainer in WIV and H5; since the eighteenth century the form Nym has been used. The corresponding verb in its original meaning "take" was already archaic in Elizabethan times and had deteriorated to "steal, pilfer." The modern spelling of this word is nim , and a strong defense of the form Nym cannot be based on the copy-text since both forms occur, Nim being more frequent. 22 The Christian name is etymologically connected with "land" and not "lance." 23 The - au - spelling of Launce is also invariable in the authoritative text closest to Shakespeare's foul papers (F1). An explanation for these consistent spellings might perhaps be found in Shakespeare's autograph: Hand D in Sir Thomas More writes all phonetically similar words with the exception of flanders in the same way ( graunt, comaund, ffraunc, advauntage ); the single form comand (170), Dyce's reading, is no longer legible in the manuscript. 24 E. G. Withycombe, The Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names (2nd ed., 1950), s.v. Lancelot , does not list either Launcelet or Lancelet as early spellings though he documents two very similar forms, Launceletus and Lanslet . 25 The parallel form Launce remains unchanged in these editions.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">John Danter's Ornament Stock by J. A. Lavin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This article has two main purposes: to reproduce those ornaments, factotums, and ornamental initials which John Danter used in the books he printed, and to provide a list of their occurrences. A number of books not previously assigned to Danter as printer have been identified by means of his ornaments, though there may well be other items printed by Danter which have escaped attention. The information presented here should aid in their ultimate identification, and should also prove useful as a partial history of the particular ornaments which were at one time in Danter's possession. All the books known to have been printed by Danter in whole or in part have been examined, i.e., those listed by Morrison in his Index to the Printers, Publishers and Booksellers in the STC (1950); one or two others not there listed; and a handful later identified from their ornaments. Astonishing as it may seem, no other English printer working between 1475 and 1640 has previously been given this systematic scrutiny, or perhaps more accurately, no study of the entire ornament stock of any other Renaissance English printer has been published. Earlier articles on this subject either deal with several printers and are necessarily highly selective, such as Charles Sayle's "Initial Letters in Early English Printed Books," ( Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , VII (1904), 15-47), or else the author is content to reproduce only a few of the ornaments owned by the printer under discussion. 1 Even the most recent article devoted to English printers' ornaments, "A London Ornament Stock: 1598-1683," by C. William Miller, SB , VII (1955), extremely useful and well illustrated as it is, is based on an examination of only a selection of the books produced by the printers with whom the study is concerned. Such surveys are incomplete, although it is true that, given our present knowledge of English printers' ornaments, the reproduction and location of even a single ornament may be regarded as a contribution to the subject. Inevitably, they are frustrating to the user, who cannot be reasonably sure that the particular ornament in which he is interested was not at some time the property of the printer with whose stock the article concerns itself. For a variety of reasons, certain ornaments were sometimes used extremely infrequently by the printer who owned them, appearing in perhaps only one or two books. Consequently, it is necessary to examine every book produced by the printer whose ornament stock is being surveyed, otherwise one may arrive at the erroneous conclusion after examining most, but not all, of his output, that certain ornaments were not in his stock. 2 Even more frustrating, however, than incomplete surveys of ornament stocks are those essays which discuss and describe ornaments without illustrating them. For most purposes, and particularly for the central purpose of identification by comparison, such discussions are utterly useless, especially when one considers the minute differences which often distinguish seemingly identical blocks. 3 Sayle's lament of 1902 that "Little has yet been done" (p. 20), remains true sixty-five years later, as does his dictum in the same essay that "our first duty towards these initials is to reproduce them" (p. 37). With this in mind, all the ornaments and ornamental initials appearing in books indubitably printed by Danter have been here reproduced, though his printers' flowers and type ornaments (which are cast, and therefore of no real value for purposes of identification) 4 are not reproduced. The five devices he employed may be seen in McKerrow's collection and are therefore not illustrated, though their occurrences are fully recorded. Since a record of the progressive deterioration of ornaments may also be useful in dating undated works, 5 every occurrence of each ornament is given, rather than merely listing their earliest and latest appearances in Danter's books. There seems little point in reprinting here the biographical facts concerning Danter, which can be found either in the DNB or in the Dictionary of Printers 1557-1640 . They are discussed at greater length in H. R. Hoppe, The Bad Quarto of 'Romeo and Juliet ' (1948). However, one or two points debated by Hoppe may be commented on in the light of more recent knowledge and the evidence provided by Danter's ornaments. We now know, for instance, the exact year and month of Danter's death, thanks to William E. Miller, "Printers and Stationers in the parish of St. Giles Cripplegate 1561-1640," SB , XIX (1966); the register of St. Giles records his burial as having taken place on 26 October 1599. This fact disproves both Hoppe's speculation that "Danter was dead by May of [1599]" (p. 36), and his earlier implication, based on Barley's 1598 edition of Breton's Solemn Passion of the Souls Loue (printed by Simon Stafford) that Danter was dead before 13 March 1598: Similarily, [ sic ] we have observed that publishers of two of his [Danter's] books, Titus Andronicus and A Solemn Passion of the Soul's Love , appear to have acquired a de facto if not de jure property in the book after Danter's death (p. 13). The last clause implies that Danter was dead by the time that Stafford's edition of Breton's book was printed, whereas it is now clear that he was alive for another eighteen months. Danter had originally printed A Solemn Passion of the Souls Loue for Barley in 1595, 6 while Stafford admitted that his edition for Barley was printed on a press which he had set up in Black Raven Alley on 14 January 1598, and which was raided by the Stationers two months later, on 13 March. 7 The recently-ascertained fact that Danter did not die until October 1599 immediately suggests that Stafford's edition was a piracy. The same question is raised by the printing in 1598 of two other items, Creede's edition of Henry Robert's Honours Conquest , which Danter had entered on 5 March 1593 but presumably never printed, and Millington's edition of the broadside ballad Luke Hutton's Lamentation , entered by Danter on 22 December 1595. The Stationers' Register does not record a transfer from Danter in either case. An alternative, and likelier explanation, is that Danter was effectively put out of business in 1597 by the raid on his premises which was precipitated by his printing of the Jesus Psalter , "and other things without aucthoritie" (Greg and Boswell, Records , p. 56), and that the three items mentioned above, rather than being pirated, were in fact printed by arrangement with him. The raid, which occurred sometime between 9 February and 27 March 1597, resulted in the seizure of his two presses "and certen letters pica, and pica Roman, and other sorts of letters in fourmes and cases" which were taken to the Stationers' Hall. On 10 April the presses and letters were ordered to be made unserviceable for printing. 8 Whether or not Danter was also imprisoned, this destruction of his equipment probably marked the end of his career. The connection between the destruction of Danter's two presses in April 1597 and the cessation of his printing would probably have been seen before now but for the fact that three books printed by Danter are dated 1597 ( Chinon of England, Romeo and Juliet, Mihil Mum-chance ); a fourth, in which he had a hand ( The Arbour of Amorous Devices ), is also dated 1597, and a fifth, with which he helped, has been erroneously dated 1598 ( A Fig for Fortune ). Of the four items known to have been printed in whole or part by Danter in 1597, Christopher Middleton's Chinon of England had been entered on 20 January 1596 and was probably completed before the raid. Romeo and Juliet was not entered, but it is Hoppe's contention that Danter's printing of it was interrupted by the raid sometime during Lent. Breton's Arbour of Amorous Devices , "printed by R. Johnes," but in fact at least in part by Danter, had been entered as long ago as 7 January 1594, and may well have been printed in the early months of 1597. The remaining item, Mihil Mumchance , was the last title Danter entered in the Stationers' Register, on 22 August 1597. Hoppe asserts that this book contains a couple of ornaments that never appeared before in his productions, a circumstance which suggests that he had somehow acquired new printing material or had joined forces with some other printer, possibly with Simon Stafford or perhaps with Richard Jones, for we find Danter's device 295B appearing on the title-page and A2 of a book bearing Jones's imprint: Nicholas Breton's Arbor of Amorous Devices , 1597. And in the next year (1598), according to Greg, he printed Anthony Copley's Fig for Fortune for Jones (p. 33). Except for the ornamental initial T4, which has been found in this work only, Mihil Mumchance contains no ornaments "that never appeared before in his productions." The presence of T4 is hardly sufficient evidence to argue that Danter "had somehow acquired new printing material," or to suggest that he had formed a new partnership. A glance at the list of occurrences will show that several Danter ornaments and initials are found used only once. Moreover, that a new partnership with Jones followed the raid cannot be deduced from 295B's appearance in Breton's Arbour of Amorous Devices (1597), since, as has been shown elsewhere, Danter had already assisted in the production of at least three other volumes bearing Jones's imprint, two in 1595 and one in 1596. 9 This last was Copley's Fig for Fortune . Greg's statement that it appeared in 1598 ( The Library , IV, xxv (1944-45), 20), alluded to by Hoppe, is incorrect. Lastly, there is no evidence that Danter "joined forces" with Simon Stafford following the Lent raid. Had he done so one would expect to find, between 1597 and 1599, not only new ornaments appearing in Danter's books, but also Danter ornaments in Stafford's books. Such is not the case. Hoppe correctly points out that "from 1599 onwards Stafford regularly used Danter's two devices, nos. 281 and 295" (p. 37), and he suggests that "an investigation of Stafford's early ornaments and initials might yield more information about the extent of his acquisition of Danter's stock, besides his devices" (p. 37, note 95). Such an investigation has shown that apart from the devices, Stafford also acquired Danter's ornaments 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18; his factotums, 4, 5, 7, and 9; and his ornamental initials C1, D1, F1, H1, I2, T3, T4, and V1, but that none of these appears in a Stafford book before 1599. One is tempted to conclude that the sale of Danter's stock occurred after his death in October 1599, and that Stafford books dated 1599 which contain Danter ornaments must have been printed during the last two months of that year. 10 Thus the printing of Mihil Mumchance (1597), The Arbour of Amorous Devices (1597), and A Fig for Fortune (1596), cannot be made to support the conclusion that Danter had overcome the results of the Lent raid by joining forces with Richard Jones or Simon Stafford. Furthermore, it cannot be shown that any one of these works was printed by Danter at some time later than the raid, and Hoppe's assertion, that "From these activities we can infer that Danter did not then look on his situation as entirely hopeless" (p. 33), is seen to be groundless. The only book that appears at all likely to have been printed by Danter after April 1597 is Mihil Mumchance , because of its entry in the Stationers' Register on 22 August, but even that entry is no proof that it had not already been printed. 11 A final matter bearing on the question of the date at which Danter ceased to print is the illicit printing of the Grammar and Accidence , in which Danter is alleged to have been involved. According to Hoppe: Perhaps as early as August 1597 . . . Danter was engaged with Walter Venge in illicit printing of the Grammar and Accidence , the patent for which a few months earlier (6 April 1597) had been granted to John Battersby in succession to Francis Flower (p. 33). This statement is based on allegations made by Thomas Pavier and Simon Stafford in depositions taken on 26 and 27 June 1598, three months after the Stationers' raid on Stafford (13 March 1598), and a year after they raided Danter for his printing of the Jesus Psalter . In the Stafford raid 4000 pirated copies of the Accidence were seized from the house next door, until recently tenanted by the Draper and publisher William Barley, but now occupied by Roger Pavier. As C. B. Judge has shown, 12 the Stationers' main concern in the raid on Stafford was not the pirated Accidences , but the larger question of the "custom of the City of London," by which a freeman of one company might engage in any other craft. Stafford, Barley, and apparently Roger Pavier also, were Drapers practicing the trade of Stationer, and the Star Chamber proceedings which followed the raid were apparently regarded by both companies as a test case. Interrogatories were put to William Barley, Simon Stafford, and Thomas Pavier (apprentice to Roger Pavier, the occupant of Barley's former premises) following affidavits sworn to by Thomas Dawson (5 May 1598) in which they and Edward Venge were accused of printing and selling ten or eleven thousand Accidences in violation of John Battersby's patent. Edward Venge escaped questioning because he was absent in the country, probably selling some of the pirated books, but in their answers Barley, Thomas Pavier, and Stafford denied any part in the printing. Thomas Pavier and Stafford, moreover, asserted that the Accidences had been printed for Roger Pavier and Edward Venge by John Danter and Walter Venge. Since we are here concerned with (1) whether Danter pirated the Accidence , and (2) if so, during what period he committed the offence, it is worth examining the wording of Thomas Pavier's and Stafford's replies. The apprentice admitted that: he this ext dyd sythence the iiij th of August last past bynde styche &amp; sell certen Accydenc es prynted by Walter Venge and John Daynter (Judge, p. 174) and in his answer to the sixth interrogatory Stafford alleged that: Iohn Daynter Stacyoner &amp; Walter Venge free of the Company of Grocers dyd sythence the iiij th day of August last past imprynt dyvers bookes (howe many he cannot say) comonly called the Accidences or introduccons to Grammar contrary to the sd decree of this ho Co r te &amp; also contrary to her highnes l ett res pattent es of pryveledge for prynting therof graunted to one Iohn Battersby vnder the great Seale of England, &amp; that Roger Pavyo r m er chant &amp; Edw Veng were (as this ext hard) contributary to the charg therof (Judge, p. 179). In replying to the seventh question Stafford said that Dawson and Burby had found in Roger Pavier's house copies of the pirated book Wch had byn prynted contrary to the sd decree by the sd Iohn Daynter &amp; Walter Venge, &amp; w t h their presse &amp; l ett res as this ext thincketh. To the charge of the pryntg of wch sd book es the sd Roger Pavyo r was contributary as this Ext allso verely thincketh (Judge, p. 180). If Stafford's answer to the sixth interrogatory is to be believed, Danter in company with Walter Venge had printed Accidences in the period following 4 August 1597; but even if this were true, it would not invalidate the contention that the seizure of Danter's two presses in February or March 1597 marked, for all practical purposes, the end of his printing career. Indeed, Danter's complicity with Walter Venge in a piratical venture following the seizure of his two presses might be cited as evidence that he had in fact been put out of business, and that he was therefore driven to the expedient of joining Venge in his piracy. In this connection Stafford's phrase "w t h their presse &amp; l ett res" (my italics) is perhaps significant, though the reliability of his evidence is undercut by his twice using the phrase "as this ext thincketh," and "as this ext hard." There are some further considerations. Hoppe comments: "From some source, probably the Stationer's [ sic ] Company, the Court of Star Chamber had reason to suppose that the piracy had begun about this date (4 August)" (p. 35). However, the reason that the date 4 August 1597 figures so prominently both in the interrogatories and in the examinates' replies is that the Stationers had obtained an injunction on that date prohibiting Stafford from printing. Their action was taken following Stafford's successful appeal to the Archbishop of Canterbury for permission to use a press. This permission had been granted on the recommendation of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London, who had certified that Stafford, though completing his apprenticeship with Christopher Barker, at that time a Draper, had nevertheless been apprenticed in the printing trade. For its bearing on the technical question of whether Stafford was in contempt of court through his violation of the injunction, the date was therefore of importance; he had in fact set up a press on 14 January 1598 in defiance of it. But the date is irrelevant as far as Danter's supposed piracy of the Accidence is concerned, and Hoppe misunderstood its significance; in fact, the Court of Star Chamber had absolutely no "reason to suppose that the piracy had begun about this date (4 August)." It will be noticed that although the testimony of Thomas Pavier agrees with that of Stafford in naming Danter and Walter Venge as the piratical printers, the apprentice gives no indication of when the sheets were printed; he had merely bound, stitched, and sold them. It is therefore possible that the mention of 4 August in the recording of Stafford's answer to the sixth interrogatory has crept in from the formula of the interrogatory itself. The clerk's version of Stafford's answer to that interrogatory is the sole evidence that Danter was engaged in printing Accidences some time later than 4 August 1597. It should also be remembered that Danter is not mentioned in the Stationers' original agreement to join in charges of suit with the parties privileged for the grammars and accidences against William Barley and Simon Stafford (Greg and Boswell, Records , p. 60); nor in the affidavits sworn to by Thomas Dawson in which Thomas Pavier, William Barley, and Edward Venge are accused of pirating Accidences ; nor in the interrogatories which were to be put to Barley, Thomas Pavier, Edward Venge, and Stafford. Judge finds it difficult to account for Danter's absence from the court records of the case, which are almost complete, and is forced to conclude that "he was beyond reach of earthly punishment," and that "his death occurred sometime in 1598, very shortly after the conclusion of the Star Chamber case" (p. 137), which we now know to be incorrect. Although the evidence is not sufficiently conclusive to demonstrate that Danter either was or was not engaged with Walter Venge in the pirating of the Accidence , or if he were, during which months of 1597 he was so occupied, enough has been said to show that the alleged piracy cannot be cited as proof that Danter continued to work a press of his own after the Lent raid of 1597. There remains the question of whether that raid affected the printing of Romeo and Juliet Q1. In Hoppe's view (which has been generally accepted): 13 "there is considerable reason to suppose that Romeo and Juliet was going through the press at this time and that its completion was interrupted by the seizure of Danter's presses" (p. 32). The main points in his argument may be summarized as follows: (1) sigs. A-D are printed in a larger type than sigs. E-K, and have a different running-title; moreover, the types and ornaments of A-D are identifiable as Danter's, while those of E-K are not, though this second font looks like one belonging to Edward Allde (Hoppe, pp. 1-5). 14 Much later he concludes that (2) "the nature of this typographical division points to the composing of the type of the second part, sigs E-K, after the composition of sig D was completed and not simultaneously with sigs A-D" (pp. 41-42). (3) "The change of type after the printing of A-D indicates that the completion of the printing of the quarto as a continuous unit was in some way interrupted" (p. 41). (4) "the type for the second part was composed and the printing probably executed in a different printing house" (p. 41). (5) Conclusion: "the typographical evidence suggests most strongly that the printing of Romeo and Juliet was turned over to someone else when the book was less than half completed. It is natural to suppose that the occasion for this change was the raid on Danter's printing-house in Lent of 1596/7, and the reference on the title page to Lord Hunsdon's men points to the book's being in the press during that portion of Lent between 9 February and 17 March 1596/7" (pp. 45-46). It may have been natural in 1948 to suppose that a change in font pointed to a raid by the Stationers, but Hoppe's supposition must be re-examined in the light of what we now know about setting by formes in quarto from cast-off copy. His first point is descriptive and is not debatable; the typographical division is obvious. The third point is an inference deriving from the first, and may be accepted with the exception of the word 'interrupted.' Point four is demonstrable. The second and fifth points, however, are arguable. The evidence which Hoppe adduces to demonstrate that sheets E-K were composed and printed after A-D and not simultaneously, seems, upon examination, to indicate the opposite conclusion. He cites the signs of cast-off copy listed by McKerrow, Introduction to Bibliography , pp. 128 ff., and notes that those signs are not present in Romeo and Juliet . In particular: The type of sigs. A-D ends quite neatly at the bottom of the last page of D, without apparent crowding or spacing of the type to make it end exactly at this point. If different printers or compositors set the parts up simultaneously from MS. copy, the chances of such perfect division between them are indeed slight (p. 42). Gross irregularities of the kind described by McKerrow, or obvious crowding or spacing of the type are not, however, always present in books printed from cast-off copy. Robert K. Turner, "Printing Methods and Textual Problems in A Midsummer Night's Dream Q1" ( SB , XV (1962), 33-35), has shown that that play was set by formes from cast-off copy, and that sheet A was the last to go through the press, even though it contains the preliminaries and the beginning of the text. Moreover, "In only two places (B2, 33 and H2, 35) does there seem to be any likelihood that the compositor juggled the lineation of the text in order to fit copy to a predetermined space" (p. 55). In Hoppe's terms, the compositor of MND Q1 achieved the impossible; after setting the last sheet of the play (H), he went back and contrived things so neatly in setting sheet A that there is no sign of discontinuity between sheet A and sheet B (the first to be machined). Only through an analysis of the running-titles and identification of recurrent types has the order of composition been determined. On the other hand, it seems inconceivable that the Stationers' raid on Danter should have occurred at precisely the moment when all the sheets of the D gathering had been perfected, rather than, say, half-way through the composing or printing of one or other of the formes. If several pages of the D gathering had been printed with the large font and the remainder with the small, or if each forme displayed a different font, there would be prima facie evidence of disturbance of the printing process, but when, as Hoppe says, "The type of sigs A-D ends quite neatly at the bottom of the last page of D," we should surely suspect the use of cast-off copy for an ordinary shared printing job. 15 Otherwise, it would be necessary to assume that, in every instance where the typographical evidence clearly demonstrates shared printing, the original printing process had been interrupted in some way (if not always by a Stationers' raid) and that a second printer had been called in to complete the task. While such raids were relatively infrequent, shared printing jobs were common, and Hoppe's conclusion must be rejected. In the first volume of A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama Greg notes a number of plays the printing of which was shared by two or more printers, and which display almost exactly those bibliographical features attributed by Hoppe to interrupted printing in the case of Romeo and Juliet . The 1611 Spanish Tragedy , for instance, printed by W. White, "was set up in two sections, A-G and H-M, which vary greatly in style. The RT differs as shown . . . There is no reason to suppose that White printed the second section." (p. 189). Again, in Q1 Richard III (1597), 'Printed by Valentine Sims,' "Sheets H-M are printed in a fresher fount of type than the rest (cf. RT). They were probably printed, not by Simmes, but by Peter Short, the type being the same as that used the next year in his edition of i Henry IV " (p. 230). An even more striking instance is Q1 of The Entertainment through London (1604), in which "Five different types are used in the RT, and divide the volume into sections as follows: A-B, C-D, E, F-H, I. . . . Presumably the five sections were the work of as many different presses. The first sheet appears from his initials and device on the title to have been printed by Thomas Creede; H appears from the ornaments used to have been printed by Humphrey Lownes; I was probably printed by Edward Allde. The printers of the other two sections . . . have not been identified" (p. 320). Similarly with Q1 When You See Me You Know Me (1605), "The types used in the RT divide the book into five sections: those of D-F and KL may be the same, but the variation of the form is significant. . . . The printer appears from the ornament used on the title to have been Humphrey Lownes, but it is, of course, doubtful whether the whole book came from his press" (p. 336). Finally, in Q1 Pericles (1609), "The sheets fall into two groups, AC-E and BF-I, printed in slightly different types, with different forms of the RT, the former having normally 37 lines to a page, the latter 35. . . . The printer appears from the ornaments used in sheet A to have been William White, but it is of course uncertain whether the whole was the work of one press" (p. 419). The third quarto of the same play "appears to have been printed . . . in two sections, A-C and D-I: the type seems to be slightly different and in the second the directions are preceded by a paragraph. The printer appears from his initials to have been Simon Stafford ( STC ), but it is of course uncertain whether the whole was the work of one press" (p. 420). Presumably no one would argue that The Entertainment through London and When You See Me You Know Me were printed in five sections because each of four printers had in turn been raided by the Stationers, and had in turn handed on the unfinished job to be completed elsewhere, but in case these examples seem irrelevant it should be pointed out that Danter himself is known to have shared assignments other than Romeo &amp; Juliet . An instance particularly relevant for present purposes is discussed in "The Printing of Greenes Groatsworth of Witte and Kind-Harts Dreame " ( SB , XIX (1966), 196-197), by Sidney Thomas, who shows that the printing of the two books was shared by John Wolfe and John Danter, each printing an approximately equal section of both. The evidence for shared printing is of precisely the kind marshalled by Hoppe to demonstrate that "the printing of Romeo and Juliet was turned over to someone else when the book was less than half completed"; each book consists of two typographical divisions, identifiable by different fonts, different running-titles, and ornaments belonging to different printers. John Wolfe printed sheets A-C of Greenes Groatsworth of Witte and sheets A-D of Kind-Harts Dreame , but it is no more natural to posit raids on Wolfe which necessitated Danter finishing the two jobs than it is, in the case of the similar cleavage in Romeo and Juliet , "natural to suppose that the occasion for this change was the raid on Danter's printing-house in Lent of 1596/7" (Hoppe, p. 46). 16 And most of the evidence which Hoppe assembles to show (correctly) that A-D and E-K of Romeo and Juliet were composed in different printing houses can be used to support the contention that the two sections were probably printed simultaneously, not, as he argues, consecutively. The difference in the wording of the running-titles between the two parts, he says, "argues the setting-up by a printer who was not aware of the wording that had been established for sigs A-D, a difference readily accounted for if the completion of the book was entrusted to another printing house" (pp. 42-43). If the printing was indeed interrupted by the Lent raid, and if the copy was not earlier cast-off for printing in two houses, when the unfinished job was handed to Allde he would need not only the manuscript, but most importantly, an indication of the point which the printing had reached. He would probably then make some attempt to match Danter's completed sheets typographically. The easiest way of accomplishing these ends would be to hand Allde one specimen of sheet D, or even the whole pile of completed sheets. Had this happened, the wording of the running-titles would probably have been made to correspond, and the other typographical differences between the two parts could have been avoided. On the other hand, simultaneous printing at once explains the discrepancies. Of particular significance is Hoppe's evidence that "the type of sigs E-K was spread out in order to make it fill as many sheets as it otherwise would have occupied if the larger type of sigs A-D had been used" (p. 44). He argues that this was caused after the interruption of the printing, by Danter or Burby basing his calculations on the size of type used in sheets A-D, and concluding that six more sheets were required to complete the job. The smaller type Allde used necessitated 'spreading,' the introduction of spaces at the top and bottom of many pages, and of printers' ornaments across the page to take up the slack and "to assure receiving payment on the contracted number of sheets" (p. 45). Initial casting-off in Danter's shop for a shared and concurrent printing job might well produce this result, based on Danter's estimate of his own type size, but if the incomplete job were handed to Allde he would surely be asked to estimate the number of sheets required to set the remaining manuscript material, given the font he was going to use. 'Spreading' would then be less likely. The strongest argument against Hoppe's explanation, however, is that it requires the positing of an unusual arrangement following on an unusual interruption of the normal printing procedure, whereas the alternative explanation accounts for the observable phenomena by assuming that a perfectly ordinary procedure was followed. Acceptance of the latter conclusion affects Hoppe's arguments about the date of printing. The title-page reference to Hunsdon's servants provides the limits of 22 July 1596 and 17 March 1596/7, the period during which Shakespeare's company was known by that name. In 1596/7 Lent began on 9 February and lasted until 27 March; since Danter was raided during Lent, Hoppe argues that Romeo and Juliet must have been in the press between 9 February and 17 March, when the company became the Chamberlain's Men. But if the printing of the quarto was not interrupted by the Lent raid, and if its bibliographical features can be explained in the manner outlined above, then the most that can be said is that it was probably in the press between 1 January and 17 March 1596/7. In fact, the title-page date of 1597 is no guarantee that it was not printed during the last weeks of 1596. * * * * * * * * The following list records each item in which the individual devices, ornaments, factotums, and ornamental initials belonging to John Danter appear. It does not record the number of times each ornament is used in any one book. For purposes of reference the four main kinds of ornament block have each been given a separate heading and series of identifying numbers, and the ornamental initials have been arranged in alphabetical order. It will be seen that Danter did not own a complete alphabet of initials, let alone a complete alphabet in one design, though A1, F1, and G2 seem to come from the same set, and some of the conventionalized foliage designs may belong to the same family. The entry for each block is arranged thus: (1) an identifying number corresponding to that under the accompanying illustration. For the devices, which are not illustrated, the McKerrow number is given; (2) the measurement in millimetres, vertical measurement first. A tolerance of one millimetre should be allowed for paper shrinkage; (3) STC numbers of books in which the block was used, arranged chronologically, and by STC order within each year; (4) an explanatory comment where necessary, giving, for instance, information on earlier or later owners of the block if known. Square brackets enclosing and STC number indicate that the item has been here assigned to Danter on the evidence of the ornaments it contains, though his name does not appear in imprint or colophon. Some of these items were shared printing jobs, and their assignment to Danter does not necessarily mean that he was the only printer involved. For further comments on them, see 'Additions to the Danter canon.' The accompanying illustrations reproduce the blocks at approximately actual size. Danter's ornaments had a lengthy history. The oldest (F1 and I1) had been in use for at least sixty years when they came into Danter's possession, having belonged at one time to Thomas Berthelet. 17 About a third of Danter's stock saw a further forty years of service in the hands of Simon Stafford and George and Elizabeth Purslowe. Another group of ornaments passed to Thomas Judson, and from him in turn to Harrison, Snowdon, and Okes. Their later history has been traced by C. William Miller, "A London Ornament Stock: 1598-1683," SB , VII (1955), 125-151, who guessed that some of the ornaments with which he was dealing had seen earlier use. 18 One of these, Danter's factotum no. 3, was still being used by Robert White as late as 1677 according to Miller's list. Four blocks (ornament 4, G1, I1, Q1) which appear in Danter's books passed later through the hands of Robinson, Braddock, Haviland, and Beale. However, no. 4 and Q1 were used by Richard Robinson both before and after the occasions on which they crop up in Danter books, and no. 4 and G1 went with the rest of Robinson's stock to his successor Braddock rather than to one of the several printers who acquired Danter's materials. Robinson seems not to have used I1, but Braddock employed it from 1598 to 1606. It therefore seems likely that Robinson either lent these four ornaments to Danter, who later returned them, or that Robinson shared the printing of some items bearing Danter's name. STC 22678 (1592) displays only Q1 and ornament 4, and despite the imprint may therefore be Robinson's presswork entirely. Some collaboration between Danter and Robinson (pointed to by the ornaments) is not surprising, since Danter's apprenticeship had been completed under Robinson. Originally apprenticed to John Day in 1582 (Arber, II.114), his apprenticeship was transferred from the widowed Mistress Day " alias Stone" to Robinson on 15 April 1588 (Arber, II. 151), and on the completion of his term (30 September 1589) Robinson presented him to the stationers to be admitted a freeman (Arber, II.706). Hoppe surmises (p. 20) that the association had begun as early as 1585, and that Danter while still Day's apprentice helped Robinson pirate the ABC 's, the patent for which belonged to his master. But whatever the case, Robinson may well have helped his ex-apprentice from time to time; in 1588 he had become the owner of one of the largest printing businesses in London by buying Henry Middleton's equipment, which included three presses (Arber, II. 706).

      <field name="fulltext">Additions to the Danter Canon In his Index to the Printers, Publishers and Booksellers in the STC (1950), Morrison lists thirty-eight items known to have been printed by Danter. The nineteen additional titles which appear below were also printed in whole or in part by Danter, as is evidenced by the ornaments which they contain. This represents a 50% increase in the Danter canon, and is perhaps some indication of the enormous amount of work which remains to be done in identifying the printers of unsigned STC books. In Danter's case the general picture of him as a marginal jobbing printer is hardly altered by these additions, but similar large increases in the canons of other printers might appreciably alter our estimation of their importance. The entries are arranged chronologically, by STC number and title within each year; the Danter ornaments which each contains are identified: 1591 22656 Smith, Henry. The affinities of the faithfull .

Although this book displays Danter's factotum no. 2 on the title-page and no. 6 passim, the many other ornaments are not his. It would be natural to suppose that the two blocks had passed out of his hands in 1592 or 1593 but for the fact that factotum 6 is used in 1606 6514, 'by R. B.' but probably by Stafford. 1594 20867 Present remedies against the plague . Device 295(a), F1, I1. 1595 3388 Borgetto, G. The deuils legend .

The Library , IV, xxv (1944-5), 20: "In 1598 [ sic ] Richard Jones entered a copy called A fig for fortune . . . and the same year appeared an edition ostensibly printed by him (but actually by Danter at his assignment)." No evidence for this statement is given. The ornaments on the title-page, and sigs. A4 and B are Danter's (5, 11), though the ornamental initial A on A4 and the V of the same alphabet on sig B. do not appear in any signed Danter book. 1596 14567 Jesus psalter . Although STC queries [ Douay ?], Greg and Boswell, Records , p. 56, suggest that this is the edition printed surreptitiously by Danter. The common type-ornaments look like his, and the only ornament, an IHS block at the end, may be the same used by Stafford in 1600 21291 on the title-page. 1596 14677 Johnson, Richard. The most famous history of the seauen champions of christendome . Entered to Danter 20 April. Ornaments 5, 12, 16, A2, B1, C1, D1, I2, T3; other ornaments used in the work are not found elsewhere in Danter's books, which suggests that the printing was shared. 1596 18418 A booke of . . .

A2. On the evidence of its appearance in this book McKerrow suggested that the block passed to Richard Jones at an unspecified date, though expressing doubts about it ( Devices , pp. 115, 169). However, the ornament was used constantly by Danter from 1592 to 1597, and almost certainly passed directly to Stafford in 1599 with a third of Danter's ornament stock. Other than 295(b) and Jones's device 283 on the title-page the book contains only an ornamental initial R (sig. A2), the same appearing in 1595 23379 (see above).</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Pope as Scholar-Editor by John A. Hart</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alexander Pope's scholarship in his edition of Shakespeare's Works (1725) has been the subject of much criticism from the publication of Theobald's Shakespeare Restored (1726) down to our own times. Two scholars, Thomas Lounsbury and Hans Schmidt, performed an extensive analysis of the edition in the early part of our century, and their negative conclusions have been the assumptions on which our judgment has rested. 1 Lounsbury and Schmidt found that Pope was careless, unsystematic, and incapable of performing the task he had set for himself. The charges which they make against Pope can in large measure be extenuated and accounted for in the light of Pope's theory of editing, in which he appropriated to himself the right to choose readings with an independence shocking to a twentieth-century editor; but even as a way of understanding that attitude of editing, we must reconsider the scholarship Pope performed in the preparation of his edition. Much may be said that suggests that Lounsbury and Schmidt, however righteous they were in the defense of literary scholarship, were too quick to make unjustified accusations, too eager to jump to unwarranted conclusions. The accusations fall into two general classes; Pope is censured, first, for his carelessness in word-definition, and secondly, for his indifference to textual collation. The definition of words is discussed in detail by Lounsbury (p. 86) as "a fair illustration of the haphazard way in which the work on this edition was done." After recalling to the reader's mind the limited vocabulary of the Augustans as compared with our own (or the Elizabethans'), he continues, . . . .Still, it is difficult to believe that several of those that [Pope] felt it incumbent to define could have been unknown to the men of his generation. Even if strange, their signification in most cases could have been easily guessed from the context. Where so vast a number of really difficult words were passed over in silence, it would seem hardly worth while to inform the reader, as did Pope, that bolted means 'sifted,' that budge means 'give way,' that eld means 'old age,' that sometime means 'formerly,' that rood means 'cross,' and that the verb witch means 'bewitch.' These, and others like these, could not have been deemed obsolete: some of them it would hardly have been right to call unusual (p. 87). But these words were unusual and strange in 1725, as an examination of their history in the New English Dictionary reveals. The list of quotations illustrating the use of each word omits in almost every case a quotation from the period immediately preceding or following Pope's edition; 2 "gyves," dated in 1704, and "bolted," which Pope himself used in the Odyssey , 1725, are the only two examples (except dialect versions) found in the first quarter of the eighteenth century. It is not difficult to believe that Pope felt it necessary to define these words; his edition, which was directed primarily to the general reader of his time, had to be comprehensible if it was to succeed, and Pope was certainly trying to make the text clear; he was not merely making a pretense of scholarship. The selection of Pope's words does not disturb Lounsbury as much as the definition of the words he selected. . . . .These [definitions] were not unfrequently the purest guesses. Even when they approached the meaning, they sometimes failed to give it exactly. A few examples will set this forth clearly. The noun, hilding , 'a worthless good-for-nothing fellow,' was explained by the adjectives 'base,' 'degenerate.' Caliver , 'a small gun,' was set down as 'a large gun.' Henchman appears as 'usher'; hurtling , 'collision' or 'conflict,' as 'skirmishing'; and brach , as 'hound.' The two definitions given of brooch are suggestive of the obscurity as well as misapprehension that had then overtaken the designation of that now common ornamental fastening. In one place it was described as 'an old word signifying a jewel,' and in the other as 'a chain of gold that women wore formerly about their necks.' The ingenuity with which, when a word had two possible meanings, Pope could light upon the wrong one can be seen in his giving to callat , 'a strumpet,' the sense of 'scold'; and again in defining coystrel , 'a knave,' as a 'young lad' (pp. 87-88). The judgment cannot be made against Pope, however, without taking into consideration the unscholarly nature of his age. There was none of the equipment which is now available to the modern scholar: libraries, encylopedias, dissertations, good dictionaries. Pope had to be contented with the best contemporary works he could find. The blame (if any) for these inaccuracies must rest largely upon the shoulders of the scholars of the time rather than upon Pope, since there is strong evidence that he relied upon contemporary dictionaries for these meanings. The same list of words was defined in Bailey's Dictionary (1721) as follows: hilding [q.d. Hinderling]: degenerate Spencer caliver: a sort of small Sea Gun henchman, heinsman: A Foot Page, Germ. a Sirname hurtling: thrusting, skirmishing Spencer bracetus, brachetus: a Hound O.L. brooch: a Painting all in one Colour: Also a Collar of Gold, used to be worn by Ladies about their Necks calot: a lewd Woman, a drab (1724 ed.) coistrel: a young lad L. Several of these are identical with the meanings given by Pope. Far from revealing Pope's unscholarly nature, they show that he was at some pains to consult outside authorities. A similar answer can be made to Lounsbury's statements concerning Pope's etymologies. . . . .As his etymologies were often wrong, it is not at all remarkable that the explanations based upon them should not merely be guesses, but should be very bad guesses. The unscholarly nature of Pope's mind was almost invariably sure to display itself whenever he set out to exhibit scholarship. This charge can easily be substantiated. The old English verb ear , as an example, means 'to plough.' Three times it was used by Shakespeare in his plays. Pope defined it and defined it correctly; but not content with this, he went on in every instance to impart the information — needless, had it been true, but worse than needless since it was false — that it was derived from the Latin arare (pp. 89-90). Bailey's Dictionary again is an authority which Pope may have used. It has "To ear or are [of Earian, Sax. of Arare, L.] to till, plough, or fallow the ground." 3 Pope's definitions are not "a fair illustration of the haphazard way in which the work on this edition was done." He defined as many words as he could according to the best authorities of his day; where he failed, the failure may be attributed to the age in which he lived. But this accusation is of minor importance in comparison with the remarks on Pope's collation of texts. If it can be demonstrated that Pope was unsystematic and careless in his use of the quarto and folio texts, then it may justly be claimed that his edition was a failure by his own standards as well as ours. This is the conclusion that Schmidt comes to: Unzweifelhaft hat er in vielen Fallen, wo er sich den Quartos anschloss, das Richtige getroffen. Aber eine systematische Untersuchung des Wertes der einzelnen Quartausgaben hat er so wenig angestellt wie einen Vergleich mit den Folios. Das beweist sein Verhalten in Rom. und Shr. Ebensowenig entsprach die Art und Weise, wie er die Quartos benutzte, der "dull duty of an editor". Er zog diese Ausgaben nicht systematisch und gründlich zu Rat, vielmehr nur gelegentlich. Einige deutliche Beispiele mögen es veranschaulichen. Im Lear finden sich in den Quartos häufig ganze Zeilen, die in den Folios und bei Rowe fehlen. Pope nimmt sie weder in seinen Text auf, noch weist er in Anmerkungen darauf hin: so II 4, 18, 19, IV 2, 53-59, IV 2, 62-68, 69 (Albany. What news?), IV 7, 33-36, 79, 80, 86-98, V 1, 11-13, 18, 19, V 3, 39, 40, 55-60, 205-222. Andererseits fehlen in den Quartausgaben des Lear Worte und Zeilen, die sich in den Folios und bei Rowe finden. Pope hat sich seinem Vorgänger Rowe angeschlossen, ohne den Leser über die Lesart der Quartos aufzuklären: so II 1, 97 (of that consort), II 4, 21, 45-53, 94, 95, 99, 136-141, III 4, 17, 18, 26, 37, 38, 51 (through flame), 57, III 6, 12-15, 84, IV 1, 6-9, IV 6, 163-168. 4 Pope's apologist cannot evade this charge by asserting that the poet lacked materials. He lists a quarto edition of every play for which quartos exist, except Much Ado About Nothing , and there is ample evidence that he used each one during the course of his collation. In addition to this, he includes first and second folios in his list: a total of source material which was available to no other editor until Capell. Moreover, part of Schmidt's statements must be admitted to be correct. Pope did not realize that these early quartos were often pirated and inferior editions. In his own age, it was almost always the first edition that appeared with the author's consent and approval; thereafter no authority could be attributed to an edition without strict examination. Consequently, he often does accord to some of these early quartos a value which we now realize they do not deserve. The main reason for this respect, however, is not that a quarto is a "first edition," but that it is an authority by an appeal to which he can delete inferior lines or add pertinent material. This will become sufficiently evident later on in this discussion. Schmidt is also perfectly correct when he says that Pope did not consistently inform the reader of textual differences or omissions. His edition was directed to the general reader, not to the scholar, and Pope felt it necessary to notify the reader only when there were longer or more important passages involved. But the accusation that Pope was unsystematic in his collation requires re-examination. Both Lounsbury and Schmidt notice that Pope does not restore all the lines from the quarto of King Lear , although he restores some of them; their conclusion from this is that Pope consulted the quartos occasionally, but not consistently. I should like to suggest the hypothesis that Pope did read the quartos side by side with Rowe's edition and that what he omitted, he omitted by choice, not chance. This point can be demonstrated by an examination of the same play which his critics use as evidence for their conclusion. Although there can be no question of the fact that Pope left out several passages which were in the Lear quarto of 1608, there are several curious things to note about Pope's treatment of this quarto which make it evident that he left out the passages purposely. First of all, wherever Pope inserts a passage present only in the quarto, he indicates it in a note. 5 He does not always directly mention the quartos, however; sometimes he merely substitutes the quarto reading and puts the Rowe reading in the margin. 6 But in this play, perhaps more than any other he edited, Pope was careful to note passages inserted from the quarto of 1608 if they were of any length. This fact is interesting since it is not often Pope's procedure, but it does not prove anything material about the care with which he collated. What is informative is the tenor of some of these notes. A few of them are as follows: These words restor'd from the first edition, without which the sense was not compleat. (I, 1, 103; Pope, vol. III, p. 4) In the common editions it is "Good dawning," tho' the time be apparently night. I have restor'd it to sense from the old edition. (II, 2, 1; Pope, vol. III, p. 35) The six following verses were omitted in all the late editions: I have replac'd them from the first, for they are certainly Shakespeare's. (III, 1, 7-15; Pope, vol. III, p. 53) After the words 'twixt Albany and Cornwall in the old edition are the lines which I have inserted in the text, which seem necessary to the plot, as preparatory to the arrival of the French army with Cordelia in Act 4. How both these, and a whole Scene between Kent and this gentleman in the fourth Act, came to be left out in all the latter editions, I cannot tell: they depend upon each other, and very much contribute to clear that incident . . . . The lines which have been put in their room are unintelligible, and to no purpose. (III, 1, 30-43; Pope, vol. III, p. 54) These and the speech ensuing are in the edition of 1608, and are but necessary to explain the reasons of the detestation which Albany expresses here to his wife. (IV, 2, 31-50; Pope, vol. III, p. 76) In these examples, Pope seems to have a fear of adding anything from the quarto edition, without offering a reason for it. In the first two examples, he feels that the passages restore the sense of the text; in the third, the quality of the verses justifies their presence; in the fourth, the explanation of the plot requires the lines; and in the last, the characters become more clearly portrayed by the inclusion of the verses. The most arresting fact, however, is the phraseology of the last quotation. These speeches "are but necessary to explain the reasons of the detestation which Albany expresses here to his wife," implying that if they did not have this reason for being, he would not have put them into the play. This is an indirect statement of Pope's theory about collation and scholarship. Every passage must serve some sort of function in the play, and the editor must decide whether the passage is worthy or not before admitting it into the text. Further evidence for believing that Pope left out quarto passages by choice appears when one examines some of the lines he does insert. The quarto, Act III, scene 1, lines 7-15, reads: [the king] teares his white hairs, l.7 Which the impetuous blasts with eyles rage Catch in their fury, and make nothing of, Strives in his little world of man to outscorne, l.10 The too and fro conflicting wind and rain, This night wherin the cub-drawne Bear would couch, The Lyon, and the belly pinched Wolfe Keeps their furre dry, unbonneted he runnes, And bids what will take all. 7 In Pope's version, lines 10-11 are left out entirely, and "wherin" (line 12) is changed to "in which"; he seems to maintain here and in other places a complete independence in his consideration of the text. 8 This practice is again not a proof that he collated his texts carefully, but it at least opens the way to a belief that if Pope thought a line was unworthy of representation in the text, he did not hesitate to leave it out. 9 It is only by an actual collation of the texts that one can find positive proof that Pope was not careless in his collation of this text. The passages listed by Schmidt were certainly seen by Pope, because he often makes changes from the quarto in the lines immediately preceding or following these passages. Thus in Act IV, scene 7, lines 33-36 are missing from the folios, from Rowe, and from Pope, as indicated by Schmidt. But the verse immediately preceding (line 32) appears in the quarto as Was this a face To be exposed against the warring winds, l.32 in Rowe as Was this Face To be oppos'd against the jarring Winds? 10 and in Pope, conspicuously following the quarto, Was this face To be expos'd against the warring winds? It is not probable that Pope read and accepted line thirty-two without seeing and reading lines 33-36. Another even more interesting example occurs in the same scene, lines 79-80. The whole speech of the doctor is as follows in the quarto (lines 78-81): Be comforted good Madame, the great rage you see is cured in him, and yet it is danger to make him even ore the time hee has lost, desire him to goe in, trouble him no more till further settling. The folios and Rowe have Be comforted, good Madam, the great rage You see is kill'd in him; desire him to go in. Trouble him no more 'till further settling. Pope: Be comforted, good Madam; the great rage You see is cur'd in him: desire him to go in. And trouble him no more 'till further settling. Pope follows Rowe in the verse form and in leaving out the additional lines from the quarto, but he adopts a word from the quarto text, "cur'd" for "kill'd," and that in a place where he could not possibly have failed to see the omitted lines. 11 The fact that not all the quarto verses thus treated can be enclosed with a parenthesis of evidence proving Pope's use of the quarto does not invalidate the case. This quarto does not have a great many variant readings in comparison with some of the other Shakespearean quartos, and what few it has are of small value. Consequently, the actual changes taken from the quarto into Pope's text are fewer than usual. But what changes there are indicate that his collation must have been very close indeed. The words taken from the quarto into the text of Pope are in most cases matters of preference expressed by the editor rather than readings necessary to make sense out of the Rowe text. For example, in the seventy-nine lines of the second scene of Act III (exclusive of the Fool's prophecy at the end, which is not in the quarto), there are just eleven readings taken from the quarto by Pope. These are: line 3 Till you have drencht our steeples, drown'd the cocks. qq.Pope; drown ff.Rowe line 8 Crack nature's mould , all germains spill at once. qq.Pope; moulds ff.Rowe line 9 That make ingrateful man. qq.Pope; makes ff.Rowe line 22 That have with two pernicious daughters join'd . qq.Pope; will . . . join ff.Rowe lines 48-49 Man's nature cannot carry Th'affliction, nor the force . qq.Pope; fear ff.Rowe lines 49-50 Let the great gods, That keep this dreadful thund'ring o'er our heads. qq.Pope; pudder ff. Rowe lines 54-55 Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue qq.Pope; simular ff.Rowe That art incestuous. qq.ff.Pope; Thou Rowe lines 55-57 Caitiff, shake to pieces Pope; to pieces shake qq.ff.Rowe That under covert and convenient seeming Hast practis'd on man's life. qq.Pope; Has ff.Rowe line 64 More hard than is the stone whereof 'tis rais'd. harder than the stones qq.Pope; ff.Rowe lines 70-71 The art of our necessities is strange, That can make vile things precious. qq.Pope; And ff.Rowe line 78 True my good boy : come bring us to this hovel. qq.Pope; boy ff.Rowe 12 These emendations are all of such a minor nature that they could only have been seen and adopted by one who was collating carefully and systematically, and since they are spaced over the whole scene they show that the collation was not concentrated in individual spots. But this scene is representative of Pope's reference to the quarto throughout the entire play. The same type of emendation of Rowe's text appears everywhere. 13 The weight of this evidence overpowers Schmidt's statement (p. 33) that "Wenn Pope bei Rowe eine offenbar verderbte Lesart fand, so griff er häufig lieber zu eigenen Änderungen, als dass er in den Quartos nachsah." 14 The few examples which he gives from the plays to illustrate his theory (which is essentially the same as Lounsbury's) that Pope first consulted his own Muse if a reading did not satisfy him, does not hold up under strict examination. 15 The truth is that Pope is very careful in his collation of this play; he constantly keeps the quarto before him and uses it to emend or augment the text, but he always reserves the right to handle his material in his own way. If he leaves out lines from the quarto edition, it is because he wishes to do so, not because he is careless or unsystematic. But the Lear quarto of 1608 has never been considered a good text except for its contribution of these additional passages. There are not as many variant readings as in some of the other quartos, and a large number of them are inferior to the folio lines. Consequently, an even more impressive conclusion can be reached by the examination of an edition such as the Hamlet quarto. This has a great number of variant readings, many of which are excellent, and they afford an ample scope for any editor who insists upon an independent choice of materials. 16 Of the seventy-five instances in IV, 7 in which q3 or q5 differs from Rowe's text, twenty-six are inserted into Pope's edition. They are such small changes that Pope must have collated very carefully to have detected them. His practice in this scene is again no different from his collation of the rest of the play, showing that his examination of the quarto readings is consistent and thorough in every act. 17 His handling of the quartos demonstrates his editorial independence in another way. It has been stated before that he gives an unwarranted preference to some quartos and that one of the reasons for it was that they were "first editions." But not all of the "first editions" are considered on the same level. The Lear quarto is not as "good" (that is, useful) as the Hamlet quarto, nor is the Hamlet quarto as good as the Romeo and Juliet quarto of 1597. The latter he speaks of in terms of highest respect because it gives him authority to leave out certain passages which he dislikes. Always the worth of a line or a passage or a quarto depends ultimately upon its conformity with what he feels to be good poetry. A question naturally arises regarding Pope's treatment of the folios in distinction from Rowe's text on the one hand and the quartos on the other. It is a difficult problem to answer accurately, because there is so little positive evidence in Pope's edition. It is customary and perhaps true to say that Pope bracketed Rowe's text and the folios together as opposed to the distinctly different quartos, and so paid little heed to the changes of the folios; that he did not, in other words, ever systematically collate the folios if there was a quarto text to collate instead. Only very rarely is there any indication that Pope has looked into the first and second folios, but it must be remembered that there is not often an opportunity for using these editions. In Hamlet , Pope gives notice that he has read the folios in two places. To II,2,400, ("the first row of the rubrick will shew you more"), he appends the note: Rubrick. It is Pons chansons in the first folio edition. Similarly, to II, 2, 480 ("But who, oh who, had seen the mobled Queen?"): In the first folio edition, it is th'enobled Queen. 18 This evidence is not at all conclusive, since it may be argued that Pope was consulting the folios in these difficult places, but not necessarily anywhere else. Thus, the question must remain unanswered. But what about Pope's use of the folios when there was no quarto to turn to for variant readings? Pope again leaves no signpost, and any information must be procured by collating texts. The labor is not as rewarding as in the case of plays with quarto texts because the results do not give absolute proof of Pope's thoroughness. In the first place there is much less chance for securing evidence since the difference between the folios and Rowe's text is not as great as that between the quartos and Rowe. Therefore, there can be no weight of numbers to tip the scales in Pope's favor. As an instance, consider the first act of Macbeth . Twenty-eight readings of Rowe's text differ from comparable passages in the first folio (aside from mere modernization of spellings, punctuation, etc.). Of these twenty-eight, at least six are obviously corrected mistakes of something which is incomprehensible in the earlier edition. The folio line " High thee hither," for instance, can only be construed as Rowe's " Hie thee hither"; such a change as Rowe's " most " for " must " needs only to be seen to be accepted in the lines on the martlet: Where they must breed and haunt, I have observed The air is delicate. ff.; most Rowe (I, 6, 9-10) This leaves, then, only twenty-two readings about which there can be any doubt as to the superiority of Rowe's text. Of this number Pope used only three lines from the folio and referred (in a note) to one other. One of these changes might possibly have been made independently of the folio; the other two could not possibly have been. The following lines in Act I, scene 5, 5-6 read the same in F1 and Pope: . . . . came missives from the king, who all-hail'd me "Thane of Cawdor"; in the other folios and in Rowe the word is "all hail'd." A critic could have arrived at the correct reading without reference to F1, so this cannot be a positive instance. The other two cases do show a knowledge of the early text. Act I, scene 5, line 26: All that impedes thee from the golden round F1 Pope; thee hinders F2F3F4 Rowe I, 7, 7-11: . . . .we but teach Bloody instructions, which being taught return To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice Commends the ingredience of our prison'd chalice To our own lips. F1 we but teach Bloody instructions, which being taught return To plague the ingredience of our poison'd chalice To our own lips. F2F3F4Rowe we but teach Bloody instructions, which being taught return To plague the inventor: even-handed justice Returns the ingredients of our poison'd chalice To our own lips. Pope Pope reinserts a part of the speech which had been erroneously omitted in the second folio and in all following editions, although he takes all sorts of liberties with the first folio reading, leaving out "this" in line 10 and changing "commends" to "returns." These few examples are very unsatisfactory and inconclusive. A further study of the play reveals the same situation. In Act II there are two instances, Act III, two more, Act IV, three, and in Act V, there are four examples, making a grand total of fourteen. This is certainly not sufficient evidence to prove Pope's exact collation of the folios along with Rowe's text. And yet, since there are so few superior readings in the first folio as opposed to Rowe, it is not fair to say that Pope has not collated the texts. The fact that the accepted lines are spread throughout the play and that there are some which are based upon pure preference (as in the case of "impedes thee" mentioned above) rather than a necessity of making sense leads one to suppose that Pope's references to the folio were not made merely because he was "puzzled" for a meaning but because he had collated with a certain amount of fidelity. This is a disappointing conclusion, but nonetheless a valid and effective one. It is reinforced considerably by an examination of the texts of Antony and Cleopatra . The evidence in Act I is almost as inconclusive as in Macbeth ; there are in this case thirty-seven instances in which the folio text differs from Rowe's, and Pope has reverted to eight of these. While this is a slightly higher proportion, it is nevertheless scarcely more satisfactory or conclusive than the text of Macbeth . But in Act II, Pope takes into his text no less than twenty-six readings from the folio, and in Act III, twenty-three. There is no doubt that, at least in this part of the play, Pope was consulting the earliest source along with the Rowe text. There is no reason, I think, to suppose that Pope was being erratic in the sudden jump in number from eight in the first act to twenty-six in the second, for there seems to be much more opportunity for using the first folio in the later act because of the many lapses made by the second, third, and fourth folios and carried over by Rowe. And it is not the quantity of these errors as much as the quality of them which demands the earlier reading. A few of the superior readings may be given as samples. Pope's version is given rather than the folio's. Caes. I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria you Did pocket up my letters; and with taunts Did gibe my missive out of audience. beg F4 Rowe (II, 2, 85-88) Caes. But by sea he is an absolute master. Ant. So is the fame . Frame F3F4Rowe (II, 2, 192-93) Enobarbus. The silken tackles Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands That yarely frame the office. yearly F3F4Rowe ii (II, 2, 245-47) Enobarbus. Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale Her infinite variety. steal F2F3F4Rowe (II, 2, 274-75) There are not many instances in the second or third acts where a reading from the first folio as good as any of these is missed by Pope. In fact, I am fully convinced that Pope gave the folio due consideration in the preparation of his text, and that the inconclusiveness of the evidence found in Macbeth and in the first, fourth, and fifth acts of Antony and Cleopatra may be attributed to lack of differences rather than lack of effort on the part of Pope. It is much more likely that his discrepancy in numbers in Antony and Cleopatra is the result of Rowe's laxity in collating Acts II and III than Pope's in collating Acts I, IV, and V. It seems safe to conclude, therefore, that Pope paid the folio text as much attention as he did to any of the quarto editions he collated. Pope's practice of collating texts as illustrated by the argument presented above was careful and considerate, but in no case did he accept a reading because it was the most authoritative. Thus he preserved his own independence of judgment, which, right or wrong, he would and did stand by. Nor does he seem to have been more careful in the collation of these four plays than in that of the other plays in his edition. 19 Since the value of any quarto or folio text was also based upon Pope's independent opinion of it, it followed that he placed a greater amount of trust in some texts than in others. Yet to all of them he gave a consideration far above that of his predecessor Rowe. For this reason, and despite previous critics, Pope's errors and failures must be attributed to something else besides a careless putting together of his text. Pope's achievement as a scholar, then, was much greater than has previously been thought, although his scholarship was directed to a different end from that of modern editors. He was not interested in collating editions in order to reproduce the historical text of Shakespeare; he wished to examine all the available material so that he could select the "best" of it for the entertainment and edification of his age.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Thomas Lounsbury, The Text of Shakespeare (1906), esp. chapters V and VI; Hans Schmidt, Die Shakespeare Ausgabe von Pope (Giessen Diss.), Darmstadt, 1912. James Sutherland, "The Dull Duty of an Editor," discusses Pope's work as editor of Shakespeare, providing thereby a general antidote to the kind of assumption Lounsbury and Schmidt have encouraged us to hold. Sutherland's discussion is based on the Pope-Theobald opposition rather than on textual analysis. My discussion I see as a reinforcement of Sutherland's view, which appeared first in Review of English Studies , XXI (1945), 202-215, and has been reprinted in Essential Articles for the Study of Alexander Pope , ed. Maynard Mack (1964), pp. 630-649. 2 The last date at which each word was used previous to Pope's edition is given here, followed by the first date after 1725. "eld" 1637, 1740; "bolted" 1640, 1791 (Pope's Odyssey , 1725); "budge" 1663, 1768; "gyves" 1704, 1774; "fitchew" 1688 (fitcholl), 1752 (fitcher); "sometime" 1678 (pub. 1700), 1786; "rood" 1609, 1801; "witch" 1647, 1812. 3 The case of "neif" (woman-slave) is also cited by Lounsbury as evidence. The meaning which Pope gives to "neif" is found in Bailey, the etymology in Stephen Skinner, Etymologicon Linguae Anglicanae , 1671; Pope used the latter authority on two other occasions, as is indicated by the following notes: Utis, an old word yet in use in some counties, signifying a merry festival , from the French Huit, octo, ab A.S. Eahta Octavae Festi Alicujus. Skinner (Pope, III, p. 322). Jymold, or rather gimmald, which signifies a ring of two rounds. Gemellus, Sk. (Pope, III, p. 464). 4 Schmidt, p. 33. "Without a doubt he has come to the right conclusion in many cases where he followed the quartos. He has investigated the value of the different quarto editions as little as he has investigated that of the folios. His treatment of Rom. and Shr. proves this. The means and manner in which he used the quartos showed his idea of "the dull duty of an editor." He did not use these editions systematically and thoroughly but only occasionally. Some striking examples may show this. Frequently in Lear there are entire lines in the quartos which are not to be found in the folios and Rowe. Pope neither incorporates them into his text nor refers to them in his annotations: thus II 4, 18, 19, IV 2, 53-59, IV 2, 62-68, 69 (Albany. What news?), IV 7, 33-36, 79, 80, 86-98, V 1, 11-13, 18, 19, V 3, 39, 40, 55-60, 205-222. On the other hand in the quarto editions of Lear words and lines are missing which are to be found in the folios and Rowe. Pope followed his predecessor Rowe without explaining the quarto variations to the reader: thus II 1, 97 (of that consort), II 4, 21, 45-53, 94, 95, 99, 136-141, III 4, 17, 18, 26, 27, 37, 38, 51 (through flame), 57, III 6, 12-15, 84, IV 1, 6-9, IV 6, 163-168." Lounsbury comes to a similar conclusion but is not as specific in his examples. 5 There are two minor exceptions to this statement: Lear , II, 2, 146 and V, 3, 48. (The line numbering is always taken from the Furness Variorum Editions, unless otherwise indicated.) 6 For example, Pope's text reads: Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue, That art incestuous: caitiff, shake to pieces Pope's note: Thou perjur'd, and thou simular of virtue Thou art incestuous; caitiff, to pieces shake ( Lear , III, 2, 54-55; Pope, vol. III, p. 57) 7 This quotation is taken from King Lear, 1608 ( Pied Bull Quarto ), Shakespeare Quarto Facsimiles No. 1, London, 1939. Pope seems to have had access to the other 1608 Quarto, called Quarto 2 in the Variorum edition. There are not any material differences between the two quartos in the instances given, however, and so Q1 will be used here. 8 Some other examples of incomplete restorations of the quarto text are: III, 6, 17-54, where Pope leaves out lines 23-28, 32-33, 39-44, 45-47, 51-52; IV, 2, 31-50, lines 39, 42, 48; IV, 3, lines 18-19, 27-28, 31; V, 1, 23-28, line 28. 9 This discussion sets aside the justice and taste of Pope's omissions. It is merely an attempt to show that Pope's collation was much stricter than has been previously thought. 10 Rowe's text, second edition (1714) is used here, since it was the main source of Pope's edition. 11 It is not likely that Pope could have seen and accepted this word "cur'd" in Act IV, scene 7, line 79 and another passage taken from the quarto, V, 1, 23-28, with a space of forty lines between them, without also seeing and rejecting IV, 7, 86-97, V, 1, 13-14, and V, 1, 19-20. The last case, for instance, is only three lines before the passage he takes into his text. 12 These readings are given as they appear in Pope's text. The italicized words are taken from the quarto except for line 55, which is Pope's independent emendation. The spelling, punctuation, and verse form are often different in the quarto. 13 The number of quarto readings taken by Pope into his text of Lear are as follows: Act I, 36; Act II, 29; Act III, 32; Act IV, 38; Act V, 28. 14 Schmidt, p. 33. "When Pope found an evidently corrupt reading in Rowe, he more frequently made changes of his own than checked the quartos." 15 For instance, Schmidt notices that Pope placed an independent reading in his text of King Lear , III, 3, 12: . . . . I will look for him and privily relieve him Pope; seek qq.; look ff. Rowe This is pure preference on Pope's part, however; he shows that he is collating the quarto by taking a reading from it in the previous sentence, lines 11-12: . . . . there is part of a power already landed ; we must incline to the king. qq. Pope; footed ff. Rowe 16 Pope had access to both the 1605 Quarto (called q3 in the Variorum) and the 1611 Quarto (q5). There is evidence that he used both; for example, q3 is the source of Pope's change in III, 4, 55, and IV, 5, 146; q5 is the source in III, 1, 38 and IV, 6, 29. They are considered together here, since the difference between them is not important in this discussion. 17 The statistics of Pope's use of the Hamlet quartos are: Act I, 50 adoptions; Act II, 55; Act III, 54; Act IV, 55; Act V, 70. 18 A reference to the first folio reveals that these statements are true but inaccurate. The folio has "Pons Chanson" and "inobled Queen." 19 This statement is based upon my study of Pope's collation of these and four other plays, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, The Tempest , and Julius Caesar , and of individual scenes in Midsummer Night's Dream, As You Like It, Richard III, and Henry IV, Part I .</field>
      <field name="heading_text">On Editing One's First Play by Clifford Leech</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This article is concerned with elementary matters which may seem beneath the consideration of readers of the journal in which it is appearing. Nevertheless, my experience as an editor and a general editor suggests that I can save newly commissioned editors from a sense of frustration and an expense of time if I talk about some guiding-lines that are in most instances applicable to the editing of a play. The situation that I have in mind is that where you (I shall employ this pronoun frequently, for what I am writing is in the nature of a personal, though generalized, communication) have agreed for the first time to edit a play in a series which has a general editor. Some few of us are totally responsible for editing the plays of a major dramatist; others are producing a facsimile or 'type-facsimile', probably with an indication of variants in copies other than the one used as basis for the text. For such scholars the substance of this article will be irrelevant. More frequently, however, in undertaking to edit a play, you are contributing it to a series aimed at a fairly wide public and appearing under the auspices of a publisher who has initiated the project and has chosen a general editor who is concerned with choosing the editors and with ensuring that proper standards of scholarship are maintained. In most instances general procedures will have been agreed upon between the publisher and the general editor, but the general editor will not have foreseen every contingency and will probably in any event allow the individual editor a considerable measure of freedom within the total scheme. It will be well to remember always that we are dealing with a triangular relationship, between the publisher and the general editor and the editor. I shall not in what follows have much to say about the publisher, 1 but at this point I should salute the enterprise of a considerable number of both commercial and university presses who in recent years have undertaken the publication of a series of dramatic texts. The triangular relationship, however, has its hazards: because it is triangular, there is often an imperfect liaison, so that an editor may get instructions (about proofs and the like) from the publisher different from those he has received from the general editor. My advice here is blunt: communicate with the publisher as much as you wish, but let your general editor know what you have said; when there is a conflict in instructions, at once get in touch with your general editor about it. 2 His instructions may, however, be buried in a cyclostyled memorandum he sent you some time ago, when you agreed to edit your text: it is part of your responsibility to know this document well. Each of the three members of the triangular partnership has his particular responsibility. The publisher is responsible for seeing that the volume is well produced, is appropriate for the market he has in mind, and is a reputable book on his list. The general editor must see that each volume in the series maintains the scholarly standards he has set himself. The editor must do his play justice, must remember that many thousands of people are going to read the play first in his edition, and that, in the case of lesser-known plays, his may be the last edition in this century. Some things you might remember are: in all probability, your general editor is underpaid and tired; he believes in his job, and expects you to believe in yours; there is no point in losing your temper with him (every editor may feel so inclined on occasion); he may well have restrained himself rather hard before deciding that he must not lose his temper with you. The remarkable thing is that, in the end, friendship between editor and general editor tends to grow through the joint task; in few instances is there an ultimate falling-out. But patience on both sides will at times be needed. It will be as well if I indicate the limits of my own experience in the triangular situation. Many years ago, when I was far less equipped for the task than any reader of this journal, I did a volume from manuscript for Henry de Vocht's Materials for the Study of the Old English Drama : it was de Vocht who first showed me how much a general editor can do for a volume in his series; more recently I have edited a New Arden Shakespeare and a Signet Shakespeare, and thus again have had the advantage of working with excellent general editors; I have been general editor of the Revels Plays since its beginning: in this series, at the moment of writing, fifteen volumes have been published, two more are at the press, and many more commissioned. So I have some grounds for commenting on the relation between editor and general editor. It is the editor's duty to conform with the established practices of the series he is contributing to, but it must be remembered that in some details these practices may change as time goes on. You, as editor, must not only know your general editor's cyclostyled memorandum but must be aware of any modifications that have appeared in the latest volumes of the series. A general editor may revise his guidance-memorandum fairly often, but he cannot do so every half-year. When you, the editor, decide there is a good case in your particular play for departing from the general rules, you should consult your general editor in advance: my experience is that you will find him sympathetic if you have an arguable case. It is your book, not his. But you must be prepared to notice what the given procedures are, including some he has not thought of mentioning (e.g., single or double quotation-marks as basic, the mode of indicating scene-headings, British or American spelling). He will probably have told you about the policy relating to elisions, including '-ed' endings in verbs and '-est' endings in superlatives and second person singular verbs. You should remember, too, that you should not have taken the volume on if you were not prepared, on this occasion, to accept the basic practices of the series. But it is his duty (i) to see that the general plan of the series has been kept in mind, (ii) to correct your manifest errors (and these may not be few, however distinguished a scholar you are), (iii) to advise and warn when he thinks you have left yourself vulnerable to attack from reviewers and to incredulity from non-reviewing readers, (iv) to bear in mind the general character of the series as already agreed on with the publisher, and (v) to recognize that it is indeed your book that is being published and, if you disregard his warnings and advice (as distinct from direction within the scheme indicated), to let you run the risk. Let us now assume that you have just agreed to edit a volume for the New Arden, the Revels, the Regents, the New Mermaids, the Fountainwell, the Signet, the New Penguin, the Pelican, or any other of the Shakespearian or related series that are at present, or have been recently, in production. You will have to produce an introduction (probably with a firm or maximum word-length indicated), a text with collation, a number of explanatory annotations, and such appendices as you want and the general editor (aware of the publisher's exigencies) will allow. It must be assumed that you have familiarized yourself with (i) the drama of the period (if it is Elizabethan-Stuart, you must have read the whole of your playwright's work and a considerable proportion of contemporary drama — the whole of Shakespeare, Marlowe, Jonson, the best-known plays of Lyly, Greene, Kyd, Marston, Chapman, Beaumont and Fletcher, Webster, Tourneur, Middleton, Ford, Massinger, Shirley) 3 , (ii) the major non-dramatic works of the period, (iii) the 'important' writings on the playwright of your choice, and (iv) the main contributions to bibliographical and textual study of the last thirty years. You can, if you like, make a 'start' (seeing the paper accumulate) before you have done all this, but you will have to do it sometime before you send in your typescript to the general editor. But let us further assume you have completed this preliminary work, or are some way advanced with it. It might seem reasonable now to start preparing your text. No great harm in beginning there. Yet I would urge all editors, before they know their play so well that its meanings lose much of their difficulty, to go through a reasonably reliable modern reprint (if one exists: if not, it must be done from photostats of the original edition) and underline all words and phrases that appear to need annotation. The writing of the actual annotations must be postponed until the text has been put into shape for the general editor. Now you must choose your 'copy text'. I have been rebuked by a colleague and friend (quoting Greg 4 ) for using this term for an edition in modern spelling. What I mean here is simply the edition you are going to base the text on as your primary authority, however much you may alter it to conform with modern usages in spelling and punctuation. Incidentally, whether your text is to be in old or modern spelling, whether you will change punctuation only when it is manifestly wrong or will try to give in modern punctuation the sense that Elizabethan-Stuart punctuation implied, the basic procedures will be the same. The difference is simply this (though there are intermediate cases): one type of edition aims at presenting the text as the author would have liked to see it come from the original press; the other aims at translating into modern usage the accidentals of such an imagined text — at giving, for example, a play by a contemporary of Shakespeare in a form similar to that in which modern readers encounter Shakespeare himself when they are reading the best twentieth-century editions of his work. Of course, your choice of 'basic copy' will depend on your decision that edition A represents, as nearly as was then possible, what the author would have liked to see. Perhaps he later revised, and you will have to decide whether you want to base your text on edition B (representing his revision) or on edition A (representing his first thoughts). Or edition B may make additions to the text which you are convinced are the author's, while the rest of edition B is a mere reprint of A; or editions A and B may derive from independent, and perhaps equally authoritative, manuscripts: in either of these cases your edited text will doubtless be a composite one; in the latter case, indeed, this composite text will be in some degree a thing of your imagining, based on calculated guesswork. 5 Having, for good bibliographical reasons, made your choice of basic copy, you can now begin on your own text. You will need (i) a reliable photostat of the 'basic copy', (ii) some typing-paper, 6 (iii) a set of cards. From the photostat you will type what you think will present, in accordance with the procedures of the series you are contributing to, a provisionally acceptable text. You will remember that this typescript is not going to the general editor: it can be as heavily ink-corrected as you like (and it will be), but you must space it generously, with wide margins. And do not use paste-ups from a previous edition: if you do, you will either follow them too slavishly or quarrel with them when they are as good as you could do; whichever your inclination, you will ultimately leave some of their errors in. Every time you depart from your 'basic copy', use a card to indicate under act-, scene- and line-reference what the departure is. The cards that result will not be your ultimate collation, because you will have noted all sorts of things that no edition needs to record. But give yourself a free hand at first, including if you wish the insertion or omission of every comma, every conceivably meaningful change of punctuation. Speech-headings will perhaps give some difficulty, however fully your general editor has gone into the matter in the guiding-lines he has offered. Remember you want the play to be read with as little difficulty as possible, and you may (I hope you will) want actors to use your text in the theatre. So, whatever you do with scene-headings (where I hope you will be austere) and stage-directions (where I hope you will be generous in the number you provide but always economical in wording), see that the speech-headings are clear and uncluttered by brackets. Do not use different headings for the same characters, whatever your 'basic copy' does (you may collate if you will). Use collation, annotation, or comment in the introduction to provide any necessary observation on a changed form of heading, but do not hold up either reader's time or rehearsal time by slavish adherence to what Q1, or whatever it is, has put in front of you. Q1 is not sacred, except in a facsimile edition. You will have your own views on the lineation of your text, and your general editor is likely to respect them, but in turn you must listen to him when he says that two or more consecutive part-line speeches by different characters must be counted either as one numbered line (i.e., a blank verse line or approximately so) or as more than one such line (i.e., as two or more separate fragmentary lines). It will be for you to decide which decision is to be reached in every instance. Remember, too, that either your series counts every line of print as a numbered line or it counts a total verse-line as a numbered line (indenting appropriately). When you change the lineation of the 'basic copy', you must of course make an entry on a card. 7 Do not do what some editors have done: have all available editions around you simultaneously, and then try to make a finally acceptable text by comparing them all at once. That is the way to induce weariness and neurosis. Weariness is the worse of the two. You would not have started on the job at all if you had not already some degree of neurosis. If you have made a provisional text from your 'basic copy' as seen in the light of your own common sense and your knowledge of the idiom of the playwright and his time, it will not take you very long to go through subsequent editions one by one, noting each reading which differs from the one that is, so far, yours. For, when the pages and the cards have mounted and you have come to the end of your text, you have to consider every detail in other editions. And you must not trust any previous edition (however distinguished) to have done your collation for you: no edition is free from error. It is true that some previous editions will turn out to be hardly worth examining in detail, and in some instances you will know them in advance. But certainly, from the first reprinting to the last scholarly edition, you must compare your rough text with what previous editors have done: where they have differed either from the 'basic copy' or from your present rough text, you must make an entry on the appropriate card. Some of the cards will be fairly full by now. Next you must consider the variants in the extant copies of your 'basic copy'. How much of this you will do will depend on the series you are working for. For the Arden and the Revels, an editor is expected to establish to his own satisfaction the 'corrected' and 'uncorrected' states of each forme, if both states exist (and it will be remembered that instances of double correction occur); for a series that comes nearer to the 'textbook' class, the duty may be, reluctantly, excused. Any variants discovered will be entered on the cards. You are now in a position to revise your rough draft, and you may make substantial changes in the light of your acquired knowledge of previous editors' handling of the text. When I was editing The Two Noble Kinsmen for the Signet, I changed my mind between prose and verse after I had seen what other editors (from the eighteenth century onwards) had done. On the other hand, you may feel (as I did on that occasion) that an emendation is justified despite the other editors' obliviousness of it. And you will prune your collation, deciding what is and what is not worth presenting to a twentieth-century reader. No one cares, really, whether at some time 'Ile' was expanded to 'I will', unless the metre is substantially helped by it. Remember that not even a Ph.D. examiner wants every spelling- or punctuation-variant over three centuries presented to him. You will scale down your card-collation to the point where you may be prepared to shed tears over labour lost. But it is not lost labour: if the collation on your cards were not over-long, you could not be sure that you had done the job fully enough. It is a still more demanding task to decide what you should offer to the reader. And you must remember, too, that if you give him too much to read in your collations he will not read any of them: do not bury the important things under a monument of trifles. This is one reason why collation should be kept strictly apart from explanatory annotation (as did not happen with John Munro's London Shakespeare ). What you must do is to indicate where you have felt you have had an editorial choice to make, whether or not you are convinced you have made the right choice. Now you have text and collation more or less done. The next task should be annotation, and you are in a position to go back to that copy you underlined. You may think that many things you marked on it are not worth annotating, so clear has the text become to you. But you have to bear in mind that you are one of the first, perhaps the first, to edit this play in the twentieth century, and, as a scholar, you know far more about the language of the play than most people are likely to do. At this stage, moreover, you may notice some words and phrases giving you difficulty which you had previously passed over as needing no comment: some difficulties are more obvious at a first glance, others become obvious only as one gets to know the text more fully. So you will probably have additions to make to your rough list of points to annotate. In any event, it is useful to annotate as freely as your series allows you (and of course in this there is a great deal of variation). When you are baffled, indicate the fact: otherwise a reader will be frustrated by his own sense of ignorance. When O.E.D. gives the answer, refer to it. When you find, independently of O.E.D. , an illuminating parallel in the literature of the time, give it. When a simple gloss will do (i.e., when the scholar knows, but an undergraduate may not), give that: no one is going to feel insulted if you gloss more than he needs. If you annotate unnecessarily, it is your general editor's task to tell you so: he has already seen many other volumes in the series through the press. He should be aware, too, that to-day we can assume a much more limited acquaintance with classical mythology and the Bible than was the case fifty years ago, when the reading public for old plays was much smaller. One of my editors told me that he got most of his editorial pleasure out of annotations; one of my general editors told me that he 'liked reading notes'. You may not feel the same way, but there is in annotation a sense of grappling with every detail of the play's meaning that has its special rewards. Your edition may have appendices, at the discretion of the general editor, who will be in some degree controlled by the publisher. These may be 'sources', which are important but do not need to be 'edited' as your text has been edited. It is usually best to give them in the original spelling from the edition of your choice, with such alterations as to make them generally intelligible — indicating, in a head-note or footnotes, what liberties you have taken. And then there is the introduction, on which you will have been given a directive as to content and word-length. This may be the editor's most rewarding task and is certainly his most arduous. He will feel particularly on his mettle here, but will have to listen to his general editor when his argument has been obscure or he has been insufficiently heedful of his play's character. As we all are. The play that is being edited is one that has, in many instances, given rise to more than one interpretation. If it is by a major dramatist, the differences may be considerable. Part of the task is to give the reader an idea of previous views, to indicate the consensus if there is one; at the same time the general editor must be prepared to let the editor say what he himself thinks: that is one of the inalienable rights when one is editing a play in the kind of series we are here concerned with. No general editor, if he is any good at his job, will agree with everything said in the introductions in his series. If he did, he would either have chosen his editors badly or have imposed his views too forcibly on them. There is nothing, there can be nothing, definitive in our interpretation of a major, or even a specially interesting, dramatic text. We have indeed the right to announce our own views; we have no right in our introduction to indicate only our own views. 8 The general editor should check all the editor has quoted from his own text in his introduction and annotations. He may also check Shakespeare quotations too (and why does any editor give line-numbers from Alexander, who, in other ways so admirable, says he is following Old Cambridge numbering and is therefore impossible to refer to for prose?), but he cannot be expected to check other references. There is a limit to what you can demand of him. Even so, most editors experience a shock when they discover what a second pair of eyes has found to be imperfect in their text, collations and references. No one of us — well, almost no one — should be allowed to edit a text entirely on his own. A general editor must scrutinize the typescript as fully as a man can, and must be more than an averagely good proofreader, on whom, none the less, the editor must not rely. So (i) the text and collation, (ii) annotations, (iii) appendices, (iv) introduction. It is amazing how many good editions we have recently had; but how much work has been put into them by, for example, the Arden and Revels editors is by no means yet — or perhaps ever will be — generally realized. Yet, when you have sent off the typescript to the general editor, you are probably under the impression that the work (proofs apart) has been done. It may be well to issue a warning: in any of the more ambitious series, you may regard it as highly probable that the typescript will come back. This will be no damning reflection on the quality of your work, but (i) the general editor is likely to have simple errors to point out, (ii) he may suggest more, or less, annotation, (iii) he may ask how you defend such-an-such an approach, may warn you of views you have not taken into account, may suggest that some aspects of the play have been neglected in the introduction. Where opinion (not fact, or an accepted practice of the series) is involved, he will leave the ultimate decision to you, but he has to indicate a dubiety that he thinks your readers may share with him. He may also have to say, with reluctance, that your introduction is longer than he can ask the publisher (with whom, as indeed you will have been told, he has made a previous agreement on this matter) to print. He may tell you that your appendices are too numerous or too long for the series. So you then, digesting his doubtless many-paged letter, will have to check, to revise, to add, to scrap this or that part of your edition. Here indeed you have to try to be patient with your general editor — partly because he asks for revision, partly because he has probably delayed a long time before replying to you. Remember you are not his only editor; remember too that he is other things as well as a general editor, and doubtless had many things awaiting his attention (apart from things he is himself writing) when your typescript arrived. You may put the whole matter aside for a time. But if you are aware that what has been just outlined is the normal sequence of events, you will not be unduly discouraged: you will get back to the job as soon as you can. The end-result may be an edition of outstanding quality. It will be your book, produced after listening to — sometimes following, sometimes rejecting — another man's advice. At least on occasion he is likely to have saved you from manifest error. You would save him, too, if the rôles were reversed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Nevertheless, I feel justified in saying that, when an edition in one series manifestly owes a great deal to the edition of the same play in another series, it is incumbent on publisher, general editor and editor to see that full acknowledgment is made. 2 Some publishers are careless in the matter of reprinting, telling only the editor when an opportunity for revision arises: remember this, and keep your general editor informed; his, like yours, is a continuing responsibility for the volume you are doing. 3 When you have catching up to do — as you probably will — read as many of these plays as you can in preceding volumes of your series. 4 W. W. Greg, The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (1942), p. liv. (And by the editor. Hereinafter called 'basic copy,' permission of the author. F. B.) 5 Fortunately, this situation is comparatively rare. 6 I assume you can type: if not, you are almost in the position of a travelling salesman who cannot drive. But, whether you type or not, you will have to check the typescript with maximum care: in any event, you will leave in some errors, and part of your general editor's task is to spot them. He will not have developed some of your own particular sources of error (e.g., eye-skip at certain points), but he will miss things that you do not. 7 You must of course remember that until recent times there was never indentation for a speech that continued a blank verse line begun by another character. If your series indents in such cases, this will not need any recording by you. 8 Cf. R. J. Schoeck (ed.), Editing Sixteenth Century Texts (1966), pp. 25-26.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Bibliographical Description of Patterns by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The basic technical problem of bibliographical description arises from the difficulty of expressing the visual in verbal terms. Parts of a description like the collation and contents paragraphs, which are condensed statements of sequential arrangement, can be handled easily enough in words or formulas; but the title-page transcription and the paragraphs on binding, paper, and typography present the same challenge that one meets in the attempt to frame an exact (not impressionistic) description of any physical object, whether it be a tree or a sculpture. Books are not exempt from the human urge to decorate empty spaces, and the descriptive bibliographer is faced with a wide array of patterns and designs (as in binding cloths and endpapers) which he must somehow record in a fashion precise enough to serve as an identification. Among the decorative elements of a book, patterns and illustrations can be usefully distinguished. A pattern results when a figure (or combination of figures) is repeated (either exactly or approximately) at regular (or irregular) intervals or in a systematic arrangement; if a figure (or combination of figures) appears only once, the result is an illustration . While illustrations are frequently representational and patterns abstract, these qualities do not serve to distinguish the two, since a representational figure can be repeated as the motif in a pattern and an abstract figure can be used by itself as a single decoration. Repetition — whether precisely detailed or suggestively vague — of a basic unit is the essential feature of a pattern, and it provides a means for classifying the pattern. Although the number of possible patterns is infinite, individual patterns bear structural relationships to one another and can be grouped into a limited number of families. Whenever such a framework can be established as a standard of reference, verbal descriptions can become both more concise and more exact. Illustrations, by their nature, are less readily amenable to identification on the basis of a structural classification (though they can be classified by technique of reproduction) and therefore present a separate problem. Pragmatically, from the bibliographer's point of view, illustrations can best be handled, as they come up, on an individual basis; but patterns, which occur in some form in nearly every book, can often be treated most meaningfully and efficiently in terms of a classification scheme. There are three ways in which patterns can be recorded in a bibliography — in pictures, in words, or in a combination of the two. The first is the most straightforward and explicit method and at the same time the most objectionable — and not simply on the grounds of expense. To rely exclusively on photographs of patterns is to abandon description in favor of reproduction. The task of a description is to provide a verbal identification which can be quoted in contexts where pictures are inappropriate. Pictures may of course be useful supplements to a description, but they are not substitutes for any part of it. The opposite extreme, of describing patterns exclusively in words, can be successful and precise only if an adequate vocabulary has evolved. In heraldry, for example, the technique of blazoning utilizes a special vocabulary and syntax which make the resulting descriptions both concise and unambiguous. The bibliographer has no such established terminology to draw on in describing patterns, except perhaps in the case of marbled papers. As a result, bibliographical descriptions of patterns must use some kind of combination of words and pictures. That is, the description itself will contain only words (preferably a standardized wording which will convey the same meaning to a large number of readers), but part of that verbal description will be a reference to a readily accessible illustration; in this way any reader who cannot visualize the pattern from the verbal description clearly enough for his purposes can look up the illustration which serves as a standard of reference. The two essentials, then, in the bibliographical description of patterns are a standard terminology and a visual standard of reference. In a few areas, bibliographers already have such references at their disposal — R. B. McKerrow and F. S. Ferguson's Title-page Borders Used in England and Scotland, 1485-1640 (1932) is a good example — but for the most part no accepted standards exist. Enough research has taken place in certain areas, however, that it would not be premature to attempt to codify a standard of reference for those areas, particularly if it is set up in an expandable fashion, so that additions can be made in the future without affecting the basic classification. Patterns in books generally appear in one of three media: in binding cloths, both as a grain and as a stamping upon the grain; in decorated papers, whether used as endpapers or as a covering for boards; and in sheets of letterpress, either as borders or as divisional indicators. Each of these areas involves special problems and should be considered separately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Binding Cloths Before the introduction of edition binding in the 1820's, the binding of a book generally had no connection with the publisher and was not part of the book as it was issued to the public. The description of such bindings, executed individually for owners of books, is thus outside the scope of the descriptive bibliographer's task and constitutes a separate field of investigation. 1 The only exceptions are the temporary coverings in which books were sometimes issued to serve as a protection until the books could be properly bound; 2 these covers usually consisted of plain boards with printed paper labels, and they offer little difficulty for the descriptive bibliographer. From the 1820's on, however, most books have been issued in bindings or casings by their publishers, and these coverings must be described in bibliographical descriptions. The most common material for publishers' bindings has been cloth, and the history of publishers' cloth has been traced by several bibliographers — notably Michael Sadleir, John Carter, and Joseph W. Rogers. 3 The historical investigation of publishers' cloth, while it provides a perspective for viewing specific cloths, does not in itself furnish the framework for classifying them. Sadleir's book of 1930 took the first step by including four photographs of cloths, showing their distinctive textures or "grains"; Carter's of 1932 (which displayed twelve photographs) discussed the problem in "A Note on Terminology" (pp. xvxviii) and worked out the equivalences between Sadleir's descriptive terms and the letter designations used by the Winterbottom Book Cloth Co. Ltd., the chief manufacturer of book cloth; and Rogers's 1941 essay furnished illustrations of eleven cloths, labeled with the Sadleir-Carter terms (Plates 30-40). It was not until 1951, however, that a collection of photographs of cloth grains was published which could serve as a comprehensive standard of reference. In that year Michael Sadleir included, at the end of the first volume of his XIX Century Fiction , illustrations of twenty-four cloth grains, labeled with descriptive names such as "sand grain," "hexagon grain," and "dotted-line-ribbed." Although the photographs were based on the Sadleir collection, that collection was extensive, and the photographs could be taken to represent most of the grains in common use in the nineteenth century; 4 but the photographs were not arranged in terms of any overall system of classification, and their physical location in a large two-volume reference work, which could not always be at hand when a bibliographer needed to identify a cloth, limited their influence as a standard. 5 Four years later, in 1955, appeared a second large collection of photographs. Jacob Blanck, at the beginning of the first volume of his Bibliography of American Literature , 6 provided illustrations of twenty-eight grains, identified by letter designations (based on the system used in the cloth trade), such as "T" (for ribbed cloth) and "Z" (for what Sadleir calls "honeycomb"). Blanck's selection, with four more photographs than Sadleir's, covered nine grains not present in Sadleir and omitted five which Sadleir included. 7 The fact that a large and important reference work like the BAL keyed binding descriptions to photographs by means of letters was bound to be influential, and some bibliographers now refer to "T-cloth," for instance, without finding it necessary to explain the term or provide a reference; yet the system has the same disadvantages as Sadleir's — and in addition utilizes terms which convey no meaning except to the initiated. Both systems have had a beneficial effect to the extent that they have called attention to the necessity of photographic samples as standards for verbal descriptions. At the same time, the two systems have dramatized the essential split between the two kinds of verbal descriptions: those which employ ordinary words and convey a meaning to every reader, and those which use technical symbols and convey a meaning only to those who have been introduced to the symbols. Both are based on photographs, but the selections are different, and neither suggests a systematic classification. Here the matter rested until 1967, when Martha Hartzog worked out, for the first time, an outline which shows relationships among types of cloth grains. 8 What was needed, as she recognized, was "an overall organizing principle which is consistent and logical, involving a symbol system which is concise and meaningful" (p. 115). She set up seven basic categories of grains, using terms largely derived from Sadleir — Morocco, Pebbly, Beaded, Geometric, Rippled, Striped, Woven — and designated the initial letter of each category as its symbol. Distinct patterns falling within these groups were then numbered — "Sandy," for example, as the second style in the "Pebbly" category, was "P2." Varieties of patterns could be indicated by modifying adjectives, so that "Coarse sandy" became "coarse P2." In Miss Hartzog's words, the system indicates "differences of degree by an adjective and quality by a separate variant number" (p. 118). Although she did not provide photographs, her chart indicated the correspondences between her terms and the illustrations of Sadleir, Blanck, and Carter. 9 The Hartzog system is important as the first attempt to provide "a coherent organizational framework within which all cloth bindings can be fitted" (p. 118), and the nature of the system is a revealing indication of the kinds of problems involved. The choice of the seven main divisions, for example, is not self-evident. Since "Geometric" is an inclusive term which subsumes many patterns of geometric regularity, perhaps "Beaded" would more properly be classified as a variety of "Geometric" than as a separate division parallel to it. On the other hand, if the main divisions are to have more specific headings like "Rippled" and "Striped," then perhaps some of the varieties of "Geometric" — like "bead &amp; line" or "herringbone" — deserve to be elevated to the status of generic divisions. The difficulty in formulating a classification of patterns is that there is no natural spectrum on which to base it. In the study of color, one begins with the concept of a spectrum or a solid representing the range of all possible color, and each of the infinite varieties of color has its unalterable place in the scheme. But cloth patterns are artistic, not natural, products, and no natural continuum encompasses them. Is "Striped" a development of "Rippled"? Is "Woven" closer to "Striped" than it is to "Pebbly"? One could construct an argument for various kinds of relationships, but each would be subjective and none would be definitive. 10 The symbols employed in the Hartzog system further reveal this problem, for such symbols as "P2" and "G7" combine two principles of notation. The letters are intended to be mnemonic — "P" for "Pebbly" and "G" for "Geometric" — and not to show relationships, for alphabetical order cannot be expected to coincide with structural evolution. The numbers, on the other hand, have no mnemonic value but imply a fixed order within each lettered division; yet there is no reason that the patterns must be arranged in this order. Thus the numbers are merely arbitrary index figures, while the letters are suggestive; and the modifying adjectives — as in "coarse P2" — carry the symbols farther in the direction of rational content. 11 Another comparison with the field of color terminology may be helpful. In the ISCC-NBS Centroid Color Charts (1965) the letter symbols — such as "d.yG" for "dark yellowish green" — are intended to serve only as easily recognizable abbreviations (to be used when it is inconvenient to spell out complete words), not as reference notations. For purposes of reference the centroid colors are numbered consecutively from 1 to 267, and any given centroid color may be referred to by its number ("d.yG" is 137). A single consecutive sequence of figures is feasible in the case of color because the spectrum of possible colors defines the scope of the classification. If the entire range of color is divided into 267 segments, those segments can be definitively numbered, because it is logically impossible for anyone to discover a new segment which should be inserted, say, between segments 137 and 138. In the classification of patterns, however, subdivisions can never be definitively established, since (in the absence of a spectrum) the possibility will always remain that another pattern may be discovered or a new pattern devised. An outline, with provision for expansion at any point, is therefore the most workable form of classification for material which, like patterns, does not fall into a continuous series. The Hartzog system recognizes this fact; while the numbered series of species under each major division (or genus) does not represent any necessary sequence, it at least provides for the indefinite expansion of that division, and the modifying adjectives allow for variations within the species. The outline and illustrations offered below as a standard for the classification and nomenclature of binding-cloth grains are therefore derived from the Hartzog system, but with a number of modifications based on the rationale just presented. In the first place, it is imperative that the divisions in a classification in outline form be not only parallel but mutually exclusive. The seven divisions in the Hartzog system do not fulfill this condition, for such terms as "Pebbly" and "Beaded" are too precise to be parallel to inclusive terms like "Geometric" and "Woven"; neither are they mutually exclusive, for "bead &amp; line," included under "Geometric" (G7), could have been placed under "Beaded," since "pebble &amp; line" is listed under "Pebbly" (P5). The first mutually exclusive division which suggests itself is one which distinguishes those patterns that are regular from those that are irregular: regular patterns reproduce themselves precisely, while irregular ones repeat themselves only in general effect but not in exact detail. Regular patterns, in turn, may be divided into those which are lineal in their symmetry and those which are radial; both "Rippled" and "Striped," among the Hartzog terms, are lineal, while both "Beaded" and "Geometric" are radial. Irregular patterns divide themselves into those which resemble fabric threads and those which resemble leather grains; the Hartzog heading "Woven" corresponds roughly to the former, but the latter comprises both "Morocco" and "Pebbly." Beyond these four divisions, mutually exclusive categories are increasingly difficult to formulate and cumbersome to employ, and it seems most sensible simply to list the basic patterns under them. In the numbering system suggested here, the four divisions are assigned to the hundreds-digit, and the two succeeding digits signify the particular pattern. 12 Since any pattern can be made more coarse or fine, and since most patterns can be given a watered effect or a diagonal arrangement, these variations do not properly constitute separate patterns and are indicated here by letters which can be used to form subdivisions of any of the numbered patterns. CLOTH PATTERNS REGULAR 100 Lineal 2 Rib 4 Ripple 6 Wave 8 Dotted-line 10 Dot-and-line 12 Dot-and-ribbon 14 Beaded-line 16 Weave 18 Net 20 Crisscross 22 Checkerboard 24 Diaper 200 Radial 2 Bead 4 Bubble 6 Hexagon 8 Honeycomb 10 Pansy IRREGULAR 300 Fibrous 2 Calico 4 Linen 6 Cord 400 Coriaceous 2 Morocco 4 Straight-grain morocco 6 Pebble 8 Sand 10 Patterned sand 12 Whorl Modifiers (a) (regular) b fine c coarse d moiré e diagonal f moiré diagonal Thus "rib-cloth" is 102, "fine rib-cloth" 102b, and "diagonal fine rib-cloth" 102be. Additional patterns can be accommodated by inserting numbers between those given (only even numbers are used here to allow for this possibility) or by extending any of the series of numbers. It should be understood that these numbers and letters are only reference figures and not substitutes for pattern names. They have no significance in themselves, but they serve two functions: they provide index figures for referring to photographs; and they make possible a meaningful arrangement of photographs, in which related patterns are grouped together. In a bibliographical description, both the name of the cloth pattern and its reference figure should always be given (followed by a designation of the color of the cloth), as in these examples: moiré fine rib-cloth (102bd), deep brown (Centroid 56) 13 coarse diaper-cloth (124c), very dark red (17) diagonal dot-and-line-cloth (110ae), strong yellowish green (131) fine pebble-cloth (406b), grayish blue (186) The verbal description enables the reader to visualize the cloth — exactly enough for many purposes — without reference to any illustration; but if he needs to know more precisely the details of the pattern described, he can use the reference number to locate the illustration in the accompanying set of photographs (or in any future set based on this system). When he does so, he finds related patterns close together; but if the cloth on the copy he is checking turns out to be a variety not illustrated, this system provides for interpolation. If, for example, it is bead-cloth of a coarser texture than that illustrated as 202, he can label it "coarse bead-cloth (202c)," even though no illustration for 202c is available. The importance of a standardized terminology cannot be overemphasized: a name, when defined by reference to an illustration, can be precise only if it is used exclusively for that pattern and if the pattern is always referred to by that name. Since the terms employed by Sadleir and Carter have achieved fairly wide acceptance and utilize commonly understood words, they form the natural basis for any standard terminology. The descriptive names assigned here are essentially theirs, though for parallelism all are listed in noun forms; for bibliographical descriptions, the names of the patterns should probably be attached with a hyphen to the word "cloth" (as "bead-cloth"). Modifying adjectives are reserved for indicating variations of a pattern: "fine" or "coarse" immediately precede the name of the pattern, but, when a pattern corresponds to the norm between the two, no adjective is required; adjectives for other qualities (like "moiré"), when needed, precede the indication of coarseness ("moiré fine rib-cloth," not "fine moiré rib-cloth"). When the letters standing for these adjectives are appended to the reference figures in alphabetical order, 14 the resulting arrangement of photographs preserves the basic grouping of variations according to coarseness. 15 Since the illustrations in Blanck's Bibliography of American Literature and in Sadleir's XIX Century Fiction have been consulted by many bibliographers in recent years and since some bibliographical descriptions refer to one or the other, it may be convenient to have a table of equivalences. The list below records the reference figure in the present system which corresponds to each of the photographs in BAL and Sadleir (and in the three previous showings of grains): 16 EQUIVALENCES BAL A 306 CM 408c LG 404b T 102 AA 102bd EC 122 LI 402 TB 118 AR 306c FL 108 P 406 TR 106 B 304 H 124b PD 112ae TZ 106ae BD 202 HC 206 PR 412 V 302 BF 202b HT 110 RH 210 YR 304c C 408 L 404 S 102be Z 208 Sadleir ( 1951 ) i 402b vii 102be xiii 106ae xix 118 ii 402 viii 102bd xiv 104 xx 116 iii 124b ix 202 xv 108c xxi 406 iv 124c x 202b xvi 108 xxii 208 v 408 xi 106 xvii 110 xxiii 210 vi 410 xii 204 xviii 120 xxiv 206 Sadleir ( 1930 ) IVa 402 IVb 406 IVc 102 IVd 202 Carter a 302 g 106be b 402b h 106 c 102bf i 202 d 124 j 114ce e 406 k 408 f 102 l 110 Rogers 30 402 36 404 31 102af 37 202 32 124c 38 106 33 406 39 408 34 102 40 110 35 102b This table facilitates cross-references among the systems. If a bibliographer, checking a previously published description which utilizes Blanck's letters, finds it more convenient to look at the photograph of the cloth in the chart presented here, he can easily make the conversion to the proper reference figure. Similarly, if a bibliographer is examining a book but has only Sadleir readily available, he can match the cloth with a Sadleir photograph and later convert the description to the name and figure suggested here. What is important is not the particular photograph used but its relation to one central system with fixed terminology. How exact the match between a cloth and a photograph should be is part of the general question of tolerances 17 and must necessarily vary with different circumstances. The dividing lines between "fine," "regular," and "coarse" — like those between "condensed" and "expanded" in regard to type faces — are not precise, and the decision to call a cloth "coarse" rather than "regular," when it falls between the illustrations of the two, will sometimes be subjective. Whether or not this imprecision takes on practical importance depends on the degree of accuracy required in a particular instance. If two states of the binding of a given book are too similar to be distinguished by means of a standard set of photographs, the bibliographer may find it necessary to include in his bibliography special illustrations of the two varieties. The standard provides a frame of reference but cannot eliminate entirely the need for individual photographs; in most cases, however, such fine distinctions in the specification of cloth grains are not necessary. Only the bibliographer who has examined a great number of copies of a book is in a position to decide the degree of precision desirable in any instance. Since various levels of accuracy and detail are appropriate in different situations, it is helpful to think in terms of a standard series of graduated levels. 18 On the first and least detailed level, only the distinction among basic binding materials is made — leather, vellum, cloth, or paper. Many early bibliographies, even those which give careful attention to such details as line-endings in title-page transcriptions, represent this level; but it is now generally agreed that publishers' bindings require fuller description than the simple designation of "cloth" or "paper." The next step, if the material is cloth, is to classify the design in terms of one of the four major divisions (e.g., "a lineal-pattern cloth," "a fibrous-pattern cloth," and so on). This level, like the previous one, is not sufficiently detailed for most bibliographical work. In general, descriptive bibliographies can be expected to conform to one of the next two levels: the third, involving the designation of specific patterns ("rib-cloth," "pebble-cloth," etc.); or the fourth, adding the adjectives which distinguish varieties of each pattern (as "coarse diaper-cloth" or "diagonal rib-cloth"). If further refinement is necessary in a particular case, one can move to a fifth level and specify divergences within the standard modified terms. Instead of piling on additional adjectives, one can use the phrase "a variety of"; the reference is then either to a special photograph (if an exact representation is required) or to the standard photograph, with the index figure preceded by "cf." (if an approximate match is adequate): a variety of fine bead-cloth (see Plate oo) or a variety of fine bead-cloth (cf. 202b) It should be understood that "cf." is used only to indicate variations between cloths covered by the same name — between, for example, "fine bead-cloth (202b)" and "a variety of fine bead-cloth (cf. 202b)." Generally speaking, if such distinctions are required, it is also necessary to provide individual photographs of the specific cloths involved. The absence of "cf." in a given case does not imply that the match is exact but only that the fourth level is adequate. Finally, one can attain a sixth level in some instances, if the proper documents survive and the effort is worth making, by tracing a cloth to a specimen book of a particular manufacturer; but the standard pattern names employed on the preceding levels are still required to complete the verbal description. Once the specification of the cloth grain on one of these levels is completed, there remains the problem of describing the pattern or decoration stamped into the cloth for the edition casing of a particular book. Sometimes such patterns resemble those found on leather bindings and could be referred to by the names employed for them by the historians of the art of bookbinding decoration — such names as "Harleian" or "Grolier," "fanfare" or "cottage." But the historical associations of such terms, as well as their established use in connection with hand-tooled leather bindings, make unwise any attempt to apply them to the mass-produced designs of publishers' cloth casings. Instead, terms more immediately descriptive, like those adopted for cloth grains, seem more appropriate. Some of the phrases used in the description of leather bindings, of course, are of this sort — such as "center and corner piece" or "interlacing strapwork" — and they can equally well be applied to the stampings in cloth bindings; but normally terms must be devised to meet specific situations. Any such ad hoc description should be kept as simple as possible and be accompanied by a reference to a photograph of the design. The number of binding designs employed by publishers over the years is naturally so much greater than the number of cloth grains that it would not be feasible to attempt the compilation of a comprehensive and classified set of photographs; rather, those designs which need to be referred to in a given bibliography should be illustrated by plates within that bibliography. 19 Such a requirement does not necessitate showing every individual binding, for the principle of illustration can still be generic rather than specific: one design, used on several different books, need be illustrated only once. Since publishers frequently have employed the same binding design, as a kind of trade-mark, on successive volumes by the same author, the number of patterns which require reproduction in any single author-bibliography should not be excessively large. This system combines — as in the designation of cloth grains — a readily understood general description with a specific reference to an illustration and at the same time emphasizes, by the use of generic illustrations, the relationships among binding designs. As an example of a complete binding (or casing) description, the following represents the paragraph on casing from a description of the 1855 Harper impression of Melville's Typee : casing. Material : diagonal wave-cloth (106ae), brownish black (Centroid 65). Front : blind-stamped decorative-rule frame, 16 mm. wide (Harper 4, Plate 00). Spine : stamped in strong orange (50), '[quadruple rule (thin-thick-thin-decorative)] | TYPEE: | OR | FOUR MONTHS | IN THE | MARQUESAS. | NEW-YORK. | HARPER &amp; BROTHERS. | [quadruple rule (decorative-thin-thick-thin)]'. Back : same as front. Edges : cut, undecorated. Endpapers : pale greenish yellow (104) surface paper. Such a description is understandable without reference to any illustrations and allows any reader to visualize the casing. If a reader is in doubt about the meaning of a patricular term or if he thinks he has discovered a variant but is not sure on the basis of the verbal description, he can turn to the references indicated and find visual specimens. For the cloth grain and the colors, he is referred to a comprehensive generic standard; for the ornamentation of the cloth he is provided with a plate in this particular bibliography. But in every case a commonly understood term is reinforced by the citation of a specific standard. Only in this way can the terms become standardized and take on an exact significance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. Decorated Papers Paper, decorated by various processes, was used in connection with bookbinding long before the introduction of publishers' casings, and it remains today an important resource for the designers of bindings. In both hand- and machine-bound volumes, endpapers are often decorated in one fashion or another, and the boards forming the front and back covers are frequently adorned with decorated papers (in conjunction with cloth or leather spines, and sometimes corners as well). 20 Despite the widespread use of decorated paper as a binding material, little historical study of it has been made, and virtually no discussion treats it from the viewpoint of the descriptive bibliographer; the literature of the subject, though extensive, concentrates more on the methods of producing the patterns than on the history of the art. One exception is Rosamond B. Loring's classic Decorated Book Papers (1942, 1952), 21 a pioneer work based on the study and classification of the Loring collection (now at Harvard); it should be the starting point for any bibliographical investigation of the subject. What the bibliographer requires, in this area as in any other involving patterns, is a system of classification and a standardized terminology. Since the characteristics of patterns are determined, to a large extent, by the methods used to produce the patterns, the most meaningful basic scheme for classifying decorated papers groups them according to the processes of production. The conventional system, as it emerges from the work of Loring and other writers, 22 has four divisions into which the majority of decorated papers fall: Marbled Printed Embossed Paste In most cases a bibliographer will wish to include somewhat more detail than the simple indication of "decorated paper"; his next step, then, is to place the paper in one of these categories. Marbled papers are produced by bringing the paper into contact with colors which are floating on the surface of a gelatinous solution; the designs frequently resemble the veined patterns of marble but, if the colors are combed, may take on more regular forms. The term "printed paper" encompasses all papers produced by the transfer of a design from a carved wood-block, an engraved plate, and the like. Embossed papers have raised patterns; and paste papers, produced by manipulating a flour-and-water mixture on their surfaces, can be recognized by the blurred and cloudy effect of their designs. Technological developments have tended to make these divisions less distinct by introducing different methods for reproducing characteristic designs. Marbled and paste patterns, for example, can be reproduced and printed photolithographically, and it would be inexact to refer to the result as "marbled paper" or "paste paper." What the bibliographer should do in such cases is to speak of "marbled-pattern paper" or "paste-pattern paper"; if he can determine the method of reproduction he can add that information: "paste-pattern paper, photolithographically printed." This usage avoids the ambiguity which arises when the basic terms are allowed to refer at times to the patterns as distinct from the processes and at other times to the patterns as the result of the processes. Classifying a paper under one of these headings does not yet provide the reader of a bibliography with a very precise idea of the pattern, and most bibliographers will move to a third level of detail, which involves describing the main features of the particular pattern. A standard set of photographs would of course be helpful for this purpose, if one could be produced; but the last three divisions listed above — "Printed," "Embossed," and "Paste" — offer the same difficulties as those presented by the patterns stamped into cloth for the casings of particular books. So many variations are possible in these categories that no chart could be devised which would do more than illustrate characteristic specimens; it could not, in other words, be used as a standard for matching and identification. Under such circumstances, the most efficient and exact method is to frame in words a simple description of the prominent features of the pattern and then provide a reference to an accompanying plate in which the particular pattern is illustrated. Indication of the principal colors is also a necessary part of the verbal description, as in these examples: printed paper, with medium olive brown (Centroid 95) birds and scrollwork on a deep green (142) background (see Plate 00) embossed paper, with silver flowers on a dark blue (183) background (see Plate 00) paste paper, grayish reddish orange (39), with horses and trees stamped alternately (see Plate 00) paste-pattern paper, photolithographically printed in grayish reddish orange (39), with lozenges stamped on a brushed background (see Plate 00) Standardization of terminology, beyond the names of the basic kinds of paper and the colors, is not possible in this situation; what can be achieved is standardization of approach. The remaining category, "Marbled," can be handled somewhat differently. Because of the nature of the marbling process, the number of types of pattern is more restricted; every specimen, though unique, corresponds in its general outlines to one of a relatively small number of kinds of pattern. Specifying marbled papers 23 is thus analogous to identifying binding-cloth grains, and, as with grains, a set of photographs showing the principal patterns is feasible. Although much has been written on the subject of marbling, 24 there has been almost no attention given to the problem of classifying the various patterns. The two major books in English on marbling — those by Woolnough and Halfer 25 — are comprehensive enough, however, both in their discussions of methods and in their inclusion of actual samples, to provide a useful starting point for surveying the range of possible patterns. But they would not be practical choices as standards of reference because they are not at present widely available and because their emphasis is on the techniques of production rather than on classification. What is needed, from the point of view of the descriptive bibliographer, is a set of photographs of basic patterns, each illustration accompanied by a standard name and reference figure. The outline below is an attempt to extract from the literature of marbling a meaningful and comprehensive scheme of classification. All marbled patterns fall into one of two categories, according to whether or not the colors are drawn after they are dropped onto the solution. If they are not touched, the resulting patterns (here called "Whisked") consist of irregular spots separated by veins and resemble real marble; if the colors are manipulated by a stylus, comb, or other utensil, the resulting patterns (here called "Combed") contain more regular lines, swirls, or loops and generally do not suggest actual marble. Traditional names for the individual patterns have emerged over the years (marbling dates from the sixteenth century); even though some of these names are not in themselves descriptive, they have become so well established that it would be impractical at this point to introduce a new set of terms. Alternate names exist for several patterns, and they are recorded in parentheses in this outline, with the preference in each case given to the more descriptive one. MARBLED PATTERNS 1100 Whisked 2 German 4 Hair-Vein (Italian) 6 Stormont 8 Gloster 10 Shell (French) 12 Smooth Body (1112d = Spanish) 1200 Combed 2 Nonpareil 4 Dutch 6 Antique Spot 8 Curl (Snail) 10 Peacock 12 Bouquet Modifiers (a) (regular) b fine c coarse d moiré g drag h moiré drag This classification follows the same plan as the one for cloth grains and allows for expansion in the same way. The index numbers facilitate reference to standard illustrations; and the accompanying set of photographs, showing the basic patterns, can perhaps serve as the first step toward such a standard. It is printed in black and white because its function is to display patterns, not colors. Although some of the patterns are traditionally associated with certain colors, there is no necessary connection, and it is best to keep the specification of color a distinct process from the specification of pattern. Given the nature of these names, one can learn their significance most readily by studying the photographs, but it may be helpful to point out verbally some of the characteristics of the patterns. "German" consists simply of small spots and, unlike the other whisked patterns, does not have veins. "Hair-Vein" (often called "Italian"), has, as the name suggests, a fine network of thin hair-like veins. In "Stormont" the presence of turpentine creates many small dots which give the pattern a lacy effect; "Gloster" also has fine dots on the body color, but its veins are thick and multi-colored, in contrast to the thin veins of "Stormont." The "Shell," or "French Shell," pattern displays light shell-like rings on the body color, produced by the addition of olive oil. If a pattern has veins of medium thickness and a body color not mottled with dots or rings, it may be given the name "Smooth Body," as here. The most common variety of this pattern, called "Spanish," is characterized by diagonal streaks traversing the basic pattern, giving it a moiré effect. 26 Among the combed patterns, "Nonpareil," easily recognizable by its horizontal parallel lines, has been perhaps the most widely used. "Dutch" is similar, except that the colors follow one another in an exact sequence and can come together in an occasional curl. If the colors are drawn along an irregular path, rather than in straight lines, and spots of a lighter color are then dropped on, the result is another pattern encountered frequently, "Antique" or "Antique Spot." "Curl," "French Curl," or "Snail," as the name implies, involves the use of a frame which can produce a series of rotary movements and thus a pattern consisting of rows of coiled colors. Similarly, "Peacock" and "Bouquet" require equipment which can produce fanshaped designs reminiscent of peacock feathers or sprays of flowers. 27 If the bibliographer finds it desirable to move one step farther, he can add modifying adjectives to these names, as in the designation of cloth grains. The relative terms "fine" and "coarse" are more frequently applied to the combed patterns to indicate the nature of the comb, but they can also be used with the whisked patterns to suggest the relative distances between the veins. When it is necessary for the bibliographer to make distinctions on this basis among examples of the same basic pattern, he can take the illustrations presented here as "regular." The other adjectives, "moiré" and "drag," are more commonly used for the whisked patterns. In this connection, "drag" refers to the elongated spots produced when the paper is dragged along the surface of the size. Whenever the addition of these adjectives does not provide a precise enough reference, the bibliographer can go on to a fifth level (as with cloth) and note variations within patterns by the phrase "a variety of" (and "cf." before the index figure); he may also find it necessary to include specific photographs of the papers involved. The fact that only a small number of adjectives are listed in the outline should not prevent the bibliographer working on this level from employing additional ones when the occasion arises. Those listed represent the standard ways of modifying a pattern and are theoretically applicable to all patterns; but, particularly in the case of the combed patterns, the unlimited variations cannot always be accurately designated without recourse to other descriptive words or phrases (such as "crosswise nonpareil," meaning nonpareil produced by drawing the comb crosswise). When such additional terms are employed, they should be accompanied by a reference to an illustration of the particular pattern. Specification of the colors in marbled patterns is best handled in two different ways, depending on the nature of the pattern. For whisked patterns the most prominent color (the "body color") should be given first, followed by the colors of the veins; for combed patterns it is generally sufficient simply to list the colors included: shell marbled paper (1110), with medium orange (Centroid 53) body and veins of dark blue (183) nonpareil marbled paper (1202), in very deep red (14), dark blue (183), brilliant yellow (83), and white In binding descriptions, "paper" should be taken to mean "papercovered boards," in the same way that "cloth" means "cloth-covered boards"; if the paper is used by itself, the term "wrappers" should be included or the paragraph should be headed "Wrappers." The following examples of openings of possible paragraphs on publishers' casings will illustrate the usage: casing. Material : sides of drag Spanish marbled paper (1112h), with dark gray (Centroid 266) body and veins of medium blue (182), strong reddish orange (35), medium orange yellow (71), black, and white; spine and corners of coarse calico-cloth (302c), brilliant blue (177) . . . . casing. Material : sides of printed paper, with light olive brown (94) fleursde-lys on a pale yellow (89) background (see Plate 00); spine of fine ribcloth (102b), very dark red (17) . . . . wrappers. Material : Dutch marbled paper (1204), in dark red (16), deep orange yellow (69), yellowish white (92), and light blue (181) . . . . Decorated papers can thus be dealt with in the same fashion as publishers' cloth, by making reference to standard illustrations for a limited number of basic patterns and to special photographs for the numerous other patterns which may arise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. Letterpress Sheets Patterns may also appear in the sheets of a book, on the same pages as letterpress. The most common location for such decoration is the title page, where there may be a border or a design separating the major elements of the page; but patterns occur frequently in other places, such as the beginnings and endings of chapters or principal divisions. They may be reproduced by means of wood-blocks, typographical ornaments, or various other processes. 28 The nature of these patterns, therefore, is not similar to that of cloth grains or marbled papers, with their relatively small number of standard designs; obviously, from the point of view of the difficulty of classification, patterns in letterpress sheets are analogous to those of cloth ornamentation or of printed, embossed, or paste papers. A publisher can use a different border on every title page if he chooses, and no limited selection of illustrations of these borders could do more than offer characteristic examples; it could not serve as a guide to the identification and description of any given border. Generally, then, verbal descriptions of patterns in letterpress sheets must be keyed to specific illustrations of individual patterns. There are exceptions, however. Whereas binding cloths and decorated papers are of interest to the descriptive bibliographer chiefly in the period since the advent of publishers' bindings, when the output of books has been enormous, the patterns in letterpress sheets are the descriptive bibliographer's concern in all books since the beginning of printing. For the earlier periods, when the number of books was smaller, the supply of types and woodcuts more restricted, and the technology less advanced, the task of cataloguing all the patterns in particular categories, though not an easy one, is at least feasible. As a result, a few excellent reference works of this kind exist, particularly those issued by the Bibliographical Society in its series of "Illustrated Monographs" and "Facsimiles and Illustrations." R. B. McKerrow and F. S. Ferguson's Title-page Borders Used in England and Scotland , 1485-1640 (1932) 29 provides a model of a pattern-reference which bibliographers can hope may eventually be repeated in other areas. Within its self-imposed limits (borders designed specifically as borders, not those made up of typographical ornaments), it illustrates each border and records the books in which each appeared. When a bibliographer is describing a book that includes one of these borders, he can identify the border precisely by simply appending to his brief verbal description the appropriate McKerrow-Ferguson number. Besides serving as a standard of visual reference, the McKerrow-Ferguson work, in listing all the occurrences of a border, provides in effect a history of each pattern; this information about the course of a pattern through the hands of several printers may be important for the bibliographer's analysis of the dating and printing of a particular work. A. F. Johnson's German Renaissance Title-Borders (1929) and A Catalogue of Engraved and Etched English Title-Pages down to . . . 1691 (1934) are other examples of title-page reference works for the same period. Woodcut illustrations are frequently not "patterns" in the sense employed here, but some patterns are woodcuts, and any reference book which comprehensively catalogues the woodcuts of a period should be consulted in connection with the identification of patterns; for early English books, the chief work is Edward Hodnett's English Woodcuts, 1480-1535 (1935). Publishers' devices constitute a similar category: not patterns themselves, they can form the basis of patterns and are repeated from one book to another. Verbal descriptions of devices in early English books should be keyed to R. B. McKerrow's Printers' &amp; Publishers' Devices in England &amp; Scotland , 1485-1640 (1913). 30 While it is possible to survey all the borders, woodcuts, and devices used in particular countries during the first two or three centuries of printing and produce catalogues for precise identification, it is clearly impossible to attain such comprehensiveness for later periods, when the output of the press reached staggering proportions. A workable approach for later periods is to organize the study of patterns by publisher. The task of recording the borders and other patterns (and devices) used by a particular publisher, even a prolific one of the nineteenth or twentieth century, is manageable; indeed, it should be a regular part of any full-scale study of a publishing house. Publishing histories could then become the standard reference works for the descriptive bibliographer in his specification of the patterns in letterpress sheets. Some histories of publishers already exist which serve this function in regard to devices. Geoffrey Keynes's William Pickering Publisher (1924) and Sidney Kramer's A History of Stone &amp; Kimball and Herbert S. Stone &amp; Company (1940) bring together at one place reproductions of all the devices used by these firms; each is numbered and can be referred to by number in the description of any title page (or spine) bearing it. A Coleridge bibliographer, when he comes to the 1844 Pickering Poems , can thus refer in his title-page transcription to "[dolphin and anchor device within oval scrollwork frame (Keynes ix)]." As more studies of major publishers become available, recording not only devices but all patterns used by these publishers, the task of specifying such patterns in bibliographies will become increasingly more simple and more exact. In the meantime, most descriptions of patterns occurring in letterpress sheets will have to be accompanied by specific illustrations. Greater standardization in the specification of patterns in descriptive bibliographies is desirable in order to make verbal descriptions more precise. After all, any rendering in words of visual characteristics depends for its meaning on conventions, and the more detailed the conventions the more exact the verbal reference can be. Standardization should not, however, be carried to the point where it restricts rather than facilitates; and the infinite variety of possible patterns in books raises this problem in an acute form. In the case of certain patterns — cloth grains and marbled designs — a comprehensive standard and generic scheme of classification can be devised without becoming so involved or cumbersome as to defeat the purpose; and other patterns which by their nature must be illustrated specifically rather than generically can still be covered comprehensively for certain periods without becoming unmanageable. But in some cases the attempt to bring together all patterns falling within a given category (such as all stamped patterns on nineteenth-century publishers' casings) might not be worth the effort, if the result was so unwieldy that reference to it was more time-consuming and less meaningful than reference to a limited set of illustrations provided for the specific purposes of one bibliography. Whenever a comprehensive standard set of photographs is possible, it is to be preferred to separate photographs in individual bibliographies, for two reasons: since terms become precise to the extent that everyone uses them to refer to the same things, widespread reference to a single set of photographs serves to encourage this precision; in addition, reference to a standard more comprehensive than is possible on the basis of a single author-bibliography places the individual pattern in a larger context and provides a more meaningful form of description. Whether or not a comprehensive standard is possible — or presently available — in a given area, the general principle is the same: a bibliographical description must remain a verbal construction, but its descriptive phrases can have exact meanings only if they are supported by reference to pictorial representations. This double approach lays the groundwork for a generally understood terminology and therefore, however clumsily, bridges the gap between the verbal and the visual. Sources of Photographs In order not to multiply unnecessarily the number of individual photographs of grains and patterns in print, the photographs presented here have been selected from those previously published (and therefore already used by a number of people).

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The standard treatment of binding description, upon which the present discussion is based, is Fredson Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), pp. 376-78, 446-50. 2 Some canvas bindings were used in this transition period (from about 1770 until the early 1800's) and are discussed by Douglas Leighton in "Canvas and Book-cloth: An Essay on Beginnings," Library , 5th ser., III (1948-49), 39-49. This period is also treated in Charles M. Adams, "Illustrated Publishers' Bindings," BNYPL , XLI (1937), 607-11 (cf. Davidson Cook, "Illustrations on Bindings," TLS , 17 April 1937, p. 296, and the letter from John Carter, 12 June 1937, p. 452). A survey of the binding terms used in catalogues in this period is R. A. Peddie's "Publishers' Bindings, 1762-1850: A List of Terms," Library World , XLVI (1943-44), 20-21. For background, see also Graham Pollard, "Changes in the Style of Bookbinding, 1550-1830," Library , 5th ser., XI (1956), 71-94; and Ellic Howe "London Bookbinders: Masters and Men, 1780-1840," Library , 5th ser., I (1946-47), 28-38. 3 Sadleir, The Evolution of Publishers' Binding Styles, 1770-1900 (1930); Carter, Binding Variants in English Publishing , 1820-1900 (1932), and Publisher's Cloth : An Outline History of Publisher's Binding in England , 1820-1900 (1935) — also published in Publishers' Weekly , CXXVII (1935), 807-09, 901-04, 1006-08, 1085-87, 1167-69; Rogers, "The Industrialization of American Bookbinding," Gutenberg Jahrbuch 1938 , pp. 243-52, and "The Rise of American Edition Binding," in Bookbinding in America , ed.

Whitaker Ridler, "The Earliest Cloth Binding," Publishers' Circular , CXXXV (1931), 763-64; the letters, from John Carter, Joseph Pennell, Douglas Leighton, R. A. Peddie, and others, appeared in CXXXV (1931), 781; CXXXVI (1932), 12-13, 28-29. 47, 66. A more recent specialized essay is Sybille Pantazzi, "Four Designers of English Publishers' Bindings, 1850-1880, and Their Signatures," PBSA , LV (1961), 88-99. See also George A. Stephen, Machine Book-sewing, with Remarks on Publishers' Binding (1908); Douglas Leighton, Modern Bookbinding : A Survey and a Prospect (1935); The Andrus Bindery : A History of the Shop, 1831-1838 , ed. Newton C. Brainard (1940); Edith Diehl, Bookbinding : Its Background and Technique (1946), I, 40-42, 70-78; and Lionel S. Darley, Bookbinding Then and Now : A Survey of the First Hundred and Seventy-Eight Years of James Burn &amp; Company (1959). A standard account of the present technology of edition binding is in Victor Strauss's The Printing Industry (1967), pp. 617-716. 4 Rogers shows that "English book cloth was the standard article in use in America throughout the century" (p. 163). 5 Sadleir's photographs were reprinted in the Book Collector two years later "in order that they may reach the widest possible public and so encourage the use in catalogues and bibliographies of a potentially standard vocabulary." See "The Nomenclature of Nineteenth-Century Cloth Grains," Book Collector , II (1953), 54-58. 6 These photographs have been repeated at the front of each succeeding volume of BAL . 7 For a list showing the equivalences between Sadleir and Blanck, see my note on "The Specification of Binding Cloth," Library , 5th ser., XXI (1966), 246-47. 8 "Nineteenth-Century Cloth Bindings," PBSA , LXI (1967), 114-19. 9 She also listed the equivalent symbols of Winterbottom, as recorded by Carter. 10 An example of a thorough and complex scheme of classification in this area is Law Voge and F. R. Blaylock, "Tentative Expanded Classification of Bookbinding Techniques," Share Your Knowledge Review , XX (May 1939), 12-21. This outline, intended as a subject guide for a card index of current literature, is not appropriate for the present purpose but does illustrate some of the complications involved in attempting to construct a comprehensive classification in this field. 11 Since there are only five adjectives employed in the Hartzog system ("fine," "smooth," "coarse," "diagonal," "reverse"), they could easily be abbreviated with small letters to render the symbols more concise — thus "coarse P2" could become "P2c." 12 Logically, the thousands-digit should be employed to make the primary distinction between "Regular" and "Irregular" patterns; but in order to keep the figures more conveniently manageable, the two major divisions under "Regular" and the two under "Irregular" are assigned to four consecutive hundreds. 13 This parallel system of referring to colors by the names and reference numbers established in the ISCC-NBS dictionary (1955) and color charts (1965) is described in my "A System of Color Indentification for Bibliographical Description," SB , XX (1967), 203-34. 14 Just as the adjective "regular" need not be used for patterns representing the norm, so the letter "a" need not be attached to the number when there is no other modfier. But whenever a regular grain is moiré or diagonal, the "a" should be inserted before "d," "e," or "f'" in order to keep the regular grains grouped together. Thus "102" would be followed by "102ad" and "102ae" and then by "102b." 15 The adjective "reverse" (included in the Hartzog system) is not listed here among the basic adjectives which are assigned letters in the classification because it seems superfluous to provide photographs of reversed patterns. Sometimes binders do use cloth with the reverse side out, however, and in these cases the verbal description can include the word "reversed." 16 The 1953 printing of the Sadleir photographs in the Book Collector (II, 54-58) shows the grains in the same order (and with the same names) as in XIX Century Fiction but without the accompanying roman numerals. The "ribbon-embossed" cloths depicted by Sadleir (Plate IVb, 1931), Carter (Photograph e ), and Rogers (Plate 33) are here classed as "pebble-cloth" because the background corresponds to pebble-cloth; the embossed ribbon pattern is the kind of ornamentation which — as explained below — must be taken up separately for each book. 17 For a general statement on this subject, see my "Tolerances in Bibliographical Description," Library , 5th ser., XXIII (1968), 1-12. 18 This concept was suggested by Kenneth L. Kelly's system of levels for specifying colors in "A Universal Color Language," Color Engineering , III (March-April 1965), 2-7; its application to descriptive bibliography is more fully discussed in the essay on "Tolerances" cited above. 19 Pictures blocked into or pasted onto the binding cloth are a different matter, of course, since they are not "designs" or "patterns" as those terms are used here. A bibliographer may choose, for various reasons, to reproduce such pictures; but their inclusion in a bibliography is less important than the inclusion of patterns, for patterns often recur on other books (whether by the same author or other authors) issued by the same publisher. Reproducing these patterns thus enhances the value of the bibliography as a contribution to the history of the book trade and will ultimately facilitate the comprehensive study of publishing practices in a given period. 20 See Hellmut Lehmann-Haupt, "The Use of Paper as a Cover Material," in Bookbinding in America (1941, 1967), pp. 211-18 (cf. pp. 269-72). 21 The second edition of the book (1952), edited by Philip Hofer, contains an essay by Dard Hunter on "Rosamond Loring's Place in the Study and Making of Decorated Papers," pp. xxvii-xxxii. Another comprehensive work is Albert Haemmerle and Olga Hirsch, Buntpapier : Herkommen, Geschichte, Techniken, Beziehungen zur Kunst (1961), which includes an extensive bibliography (pp. 183-95). Other historical studies are Bertrand Guégan, "History and Manufacture of End-Papers" (trans. Katherine Knight), Publishers' Weekly , CXVI (1929), 1755-57, 1759; Edith Diehl, Bookbinding : Its Background and Technique (1946), I, 182-89; and Charles M. Adams, "Some Notes on the Art of Marbling Paper in the Seventeenth Century," BNYPL , LI (1947), 411-22. 22 See, for example, Enid Marx, "Pattern Papers," Penrose Annual , XLIV (1950), 51-53; and Olga Hirsch, "Decorated Papers," Penrose Annual , LI (1957), 48-53. For further samples, see A Specimen Book of Pattern Papers, Designed for and in Use at the Curwen Press (1928). 23 The marbling process can be applied to cloth as well as paper, and marbled cloth has occasionally been used as a binding material; see Bernard C. Middleton, A Manual of the Art of Bookbinding Technique (1963). 24 See Dard Hunter, "A Bibliography of Marbled Paper," Paper Trade Journal , LXXII (28 April 1921), 52, 54, 56, 58. 25 C. W. Woolnough, The Whole Art of Marbling (1853, 1881); Josef Halfer, The Progress of the Marbling Art (1884; trans. Herman Dieck, 1893). Other prominent treatments of marbling, with a number of samples, are M. Fichtenberg's Nouveau Manuel Complet du Fabricant de Papiers de Fantasie (1852); James B. Nicholson's A Manual of the Art of Bookbinding (1856), pp. 82-130, 246-56; and Rosamond B. Loring's Marbled Papers (1933). A more recent display of marbling patterns is the frontispiece to Bernard C. Middleton's A History of English Craft Bookbinding Technique (1963). Verbal descriptions of the standard patterns are given in E. J. Labarre's Dictionary and Encyclopaedia of Paper and Paper-Making (1952), pp. 155-58. The best places to examine samples, of course, are in such outstanding collections as that of Olga Hirsch (British Museum) — see Printing Historical Society Newsletter , No. 12, Feb. 1969. 26 Because a watered effect can be produced on other patterns as well, "moiré" must be used as a modifying adjective which can be attached to any pattern name; therefore "Spanish," though a prominent pattern, cannot logically be listed as one of the basic unmodified patterns, since the moiré effect is an essential part of what the name traditionally implies. 27 Detailed descriptions of the methods of producing the various patterns are found in the books by Woolnough, Halfer, Nicholson, and Loring. Among other treatments are Sydney M. Cockerell, Marbling Paper as a School Subject (1934); J. Halliday's essay in How to Make Hand Decorated Patterned Papers for Book Craft (2nd ed., 1934), pp. 36-42; Franz Weisse, Die Kunst des Marmorierens (1940); Tim Thrift, Modern Methods in Marbling Paper (1945); Morris S. Kantrowitz and Ernest W. Spencer, Process of Marbling Paper (GPO-PIA Joint Research Bulletin B-1, 1947); "Marbling Magic," Inland Printer , CXXII (Jan. 1949) 48-49; G. Bernard Hughes, "English Marbled Papers," Country Life , CXII (1952), 2100-01; William Bond Wheelwright, "How Marbled Papers Are Made," Paper Maker , XXII, no. 2 (Sept. 1953), 1-5; and "The Neglected Art of Paper Marbling: A Detailed Survey of Current American Techniques and Materials," British Printer , LXVII (March-April 1955), 36-41. Cf. Kiyofusa Narita, "Suminagashi," Paper Maker , XXIV, no. 1 (Feb. 1955), 27-31. 28 Engraved title pages, though produced separately and not part of the sheets, are also covered by this discussion. For terminology to employ in describing typographical ornaments, Franz Sales Meyer's A Handbook of Ornament (trans. Hugh Stannus, 1894) is sometimes helpful. 29 See also F. S.

      <field name="heading_text">A List of Plays and Entertainments by Scottish Dramatists 1660-1800 by Terence Tobin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The following list of plays and entertainments attempts to register all known dramatic works by native-born Scottish authors written during the Restoration and eighteenth century. Because of the fugitive nature of the material this list must be incomplete. The precarious position of the drama in North Britain is no doubt responsible for the loss of a number of theatrical pieces. Scots at home and abroad frequently put out plays anonymously. This practice, which arose from necessity because of ecclesiastical and civil curtailment, and became customary, was followed from the birth of professional theater in Scotland through the era of Sir Walter Scott.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Edinburgh was the center of the Scottish theatrical world, and the only town which offered regular dramatic presentations during most of the period under consideration. Theaters did open during the last years of the eighteenth century in Aberdeen, Glasgow, Arbroath, and Dundee. Other towns also witnessed occasional productions, but most new endeavors premiered in the Scottish capital.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scots playwrights almost invariably tried to have their dramas staged in London, and settled for a Scottish opening as a last resort. Because of the abiding interest in the London stage, and the frequent imitation of British drama, one can speak of Scottish dramatists only in the sense of national origin. Morever, Scottish drama is a false label, because one cannot show a significant difference between the creative products of Englishmen and those of Scots which indicate indigenous drama in the North, nor peculiarly Scottish tendencies in plays which appeared in the South. Rather than eliciting a distinction between plays by Scots which appeared in Scotland, or elsewhere, arising from divergent traditions, this entire corpus of works is certainly British in form, and frequently British in feeling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This register, which is arranged according to authors, gives the title, place and date of premiere, place and date of first publication. When significant, other editions and printings of the text are noted. Select notices and reviews of the plays are listed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The title of the play is followed by an indication of the type of play concerned. These designations are in no way final. Thus a tragedy may be more accurately described as a melodrama, a ballad opera may be an operatic farce. Where possible the designation employed by the playwright or playbills has been used. The abbreviations for types of dramas are as follows: B.O. Ballad Opera Can. Cantata C. Comedy C.O. Comic Opera D.P. Dramatic Poem E. Entertainment F. Farce H. History I. Interlude M. Masque Mus. Musical O. Opera O.F. Operatic Farce Or. Oratorio P. Pastoral Pan. Pantomime Pol. Political Pre. Prelude Rel. Religious Sat. Satire T. Tragedy T.C. Tragi-comedy</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The theater or place of premiere and the date of the opening are given in round brackets. If no such information is presented, the play did not appear on the stage, or there is no record of its having been presented. The abbreviations for the theaters are as follows: Can. Canongate Theatre, Edinburgh C.G. Covent Garden, London D.L. Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, London H. Little Theatre in the Haymarket, London L.I.F. Lincoln's Inn Fields, London T.H. Taylor's Hall, Edinburgh T.R.E. Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, i.e. the playhouse in Shakespeare Square, in Prince's Street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notices of plays which opened in Edinburgh were almost exclusively the province of the Edinburgh Evening Courant and the Caledonian Mercury . These newspapers are abbreviated E.E.C. and C.M. respectively. Neither newspaper felt constrained to give the name of every play it advertised. Because dramatic criticism is almost nonexistent in the Scottish press of this period, only the first notice of the play is given. With regard to the anonymous plays, interludes, after pieces and the like, the newspaper notice is in many instances the sole indication that the play existed. Because of the obscurity of these short entertainments, only those which seem to be of a local or native character are included.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notation of bibliographically useful data not generally known has been made under several entries. Select periodical and newspaper notices of plays, particularly contemporaneous reviews, are listed under the play to which they refer. Some recent scholarship on particular plays is noted. The London Stage 1660-1800 (1965), which is abbreviated L.S. , provides much valuable information about the plays included in this list which appeared in the British capital.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A number of errors which have appeared in previous lists of plays have been silently corrected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The necessary first-hand investigation of many of the materials used in this study was made possible by an XL Grant awarded by the Purdue University Research Foundation.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">"Press" Letters: Samuel Aris 1730-32 by Keith I. D. Maslen</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Single letters of the alphabet, not signatures or catchwords, disfigure the foot of certain pages in books London printed by Samuel Aris 1730-32. As each book contains only a few letters, upper or lower-case, placed one in each forme or sheet with occasional omissions, their function as press-figures is readily supposed. In Eustace Budgell, A Letter to Cleomenes (1731) occur the letters C J R W: in one copy C or C in 19 formes, J in 5 formes, R or R in 13 formes, W or w in 5 formes — other copies vary slightly. 1 No fewer than seven letters, C F I J R T W, are used in Budgell's Memoirs of the life and character of the late Earl of Orrery (1732). These letters plus g (?), l, p, and T appear in others of the seven books printed by Aris that bear press letters; J is found in all seven, C and W in five books. One has evidently stumbled across another of the 'many idiosyncratic numbers or marks adopted in some books . . . [involving] the use of letters perhaps to indicate pressmen's names'. 2 One notices the considerable number and haphazard selection of letters, the disproportionate use of some, and the instability of their grouping. Besides three regulars, C, J, and W, another six or seven letters more occasionally appear, whilst some formes or sheets are unlettered. No doubt a larger sample would reveal more letters and other patterns. From such tangible evidence in the finished product one is unable to infer the total number either of presses or pressmen at work, since work at half-press cannot be distinguished from work at full-press requiring a second unmarked crew-member; nor can the absence of letters on occasions be taken to mean that no other presses or men are concerned. However, something may be made of the facts by comparison with press-figures and related work patterns at the Bowyer Press for the same years 1730-32. Details of press-work are taken from a recently discovered Bowyer ledger, which records work done and prices charged by compositors and pressmen for the period 1730-39. 3 Three to five presses were in constant use at the Bowyer Press from March 1730 to March 1732. Occasionally there were six and rarely seven in use in any one pay period of two to four weeks. At these presses wrought from six to twelve men, usually but not always working in pairs. At one time or another altogether eight presses were in operation, corresponding with the figures 1-8 evidenced in the printed sheets. At the Bowyer Press, then, generally speaking, figures denote a press, and identify work done at that press, either by a partnership, or occasionally by one man, who regularly wrought there for a period of weeks or month. Some anomalies, apparent or real, may relate to the frequent changes in personnel and their movements within the shop. During these two years no fewer than nineteen press-men were employed at the Bowyer Press, some for periods of only a few weeks, others during the whole time. Similarly at some presses the crew remained constant for many months at a time, whilst at others there were changes every few weeks. These phenomena are a function of many variables, including most obviously the going and coming of workmen, either permanently or temporarily, the amount of work offering, and breakdowns of equipment. At the Bowyer Press, as no doubt at any other commercial press of this or other times, frequent changes from press to press and of partnership produce complex and shifting work-patterns, not easily described and in fact impossible to infer from patterns of press-figures found in the finished product. It is unlikely that the ten or so 'press'-letters in books printed by Aris — these having been identified as his productions by imprint, types, and ornaments — refer to actual presses. From the little known of his business one would expect him to have fewer presses than the elder Bowyer, recognized at the time as a major London printer, and even the preeminent William Strahan boasts forty years later of no more than '7, 8, or 9 Presses . . . constantly employed' in his commercial printing-house. 4 The seven press-letters in Budgell's Memoirs of the Earl of Orrery mentioned above may be taken to reflect changes of press-crews. Such changes are shown by the Bowyer records to be not uncommon in the life of a press. It is intrinsically probable then that the haphazard letters refer to men, perhaps by the initial of their surname. It is not hard to believe that by comparison with Bowyer's nineteen pressmen Aris employed twelve men over roughly the same period, as delimited very approximately for Aris by title-page dates. The numerical comparison however can give little idea of the relative size and output of Aris's establishment, since one cannot assume for this period either regular employment or optimum or even steady output per man. If only one knew the names of Aris's pressmen 1730-32! The list of his apprentices given below is no help. Those apprentices out of their time before 1730 might well have taken jobs elsewhere, and in any case they are more likely to have been on the composing side, like Thomas Aris, later proprietor of the Birmingham Gazette . On the other hand, if any of the apprentices did help at press 1730-32, his labours, most likely as 'second', would not need to be marked by letter, because he would claim no wages at piece rates from his master. Press-letters as used by Aris have the same value as figures in alerting one to possibilities of reissue, reimpression, and divided printing, as evidenced by items 9, 14 and 15 described below. Possibly insignificant are typographical variations in press-letters: the alternation between upper and lower case letters, changes in size of type, and the occasional use of italic instead of roman. Sometimes the choice seems to have been made from the case nearest to hand, containing the type used in the text or the notes. Still it seems odd that in Budgell's Memoirs of the Earl of Orrery only W, out of the seven press-letters used, alternates between W and w or w . A similar variation in size of press-figures was noticed by J. D. Fleeman in respect of William Somerville's The Chace (1735), which was printed by Bowyer, but here on closer examination the variation seems to be without significance. 5 Unlike figures, letters have one great inconvenience, that they may easily be confused with signatures and even catchwords, such as A and I. This is surely why they are seldom encountered. But how 'idiosyncratic' was this use of letters? For Aris during 1730-32 it was a standard practice, since out of twelve octavos dated within these years and identified as coming from Aris's press, seven are lettered; indeed for 1731-32 only one book is unlettered. Aris seems to have adopted the practice, or sanctioned it, some time in 1730. Daniel Waterland's The nature, obligation, and efficacy, of the Christian Sacraments, considered , 'Printed by Sam. Aris for John Crownfield' (1730), is unmarked, but its Supplement , also dated 1730, is lettered. However, Budgell's Letter to His Excellency Mr. Ulrick D'Ypres (1731) is also unmarked. Title-page dates of course are no precise indication of the date of printing. Before 1730 the few books recognized as Aris's, most belonging to 1727-28, have some sheets unmarked and others figured 1 or 3. After 1732 no books have been recognized as coming from Aris's press, on the evidence of imprint or printer's devices, of which Aris used at least two; by October 1734 he was dead. The above sample is too small to allow generalizations about the limits and extent of Aris's use of press-letters. It is worth noting that other printers in this period use letters, but in ways that I shall not try to explain. Bentham at Cambridge, as remarked by Dr. McKenzie, uses b-d, 3-6, and 8 in a book of 1743, and examples of Parliamentary printing, Acts, Bills, and the King's Speeches, by John Baskett 1726-51 bear the letters B/b, C/c, e, and figures 1-8. This is a complication to be added to the 'many mysteries about press-figures yet to be solved'. 6 The above examples, trivial in themselves, remind us that we need continually to 'reconsider our ideas about the permissible variations in the early printer's routine', and to revise and extend our notions of what is considered normal, since it is out of such notions that our bibliographical and textual hypotheses are made. 7</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Biographical Details of Samuel Aris SAMUEL ARIS printer, of Creed Lane 1720?-32?; bound 6 apprentices 6 Feb. 1720/1-1 Sept. 1730; died 1734. This summary corrects The London Compositor (1947), p. 36, where Ellic Howe gives terminal dates 1725-39, and mentions only four apprentices. Fuller details follow. Marriage : 6 Feb. 1713/14 Saml Aris of precinct of White Friars single and Mary Whitledge of St. Martin Ludgate single by licence (Harleian Society Registers, vol. 63, St. Matthew, Friday Street). Children : eight from 2 April 1721 to 7 Feb. 1733/4, though of these apparently only three survived their parents: Mary (b. 26 Oct., bapt. 18 Nov. 1722), Samuel (b.21 June, bapt. 12 July 1724), and Amy (b. 2 Feb., bapt. 7 Feb. 1733/4). The other children 1721-34 are Samuel bapt. 2 Apr. 1721, Catherine bapt. 7 Nov. 1725, Thomas bapt. 14 Feb. 1727/8, Catherine bapt. 27 July 1729, Ann bapt. 6 Sept. 1730 (Guildhall Library: Register of St Martins Ludgate). Death : presumed between 7 February and 17 October 1734, on which date was issued a commission to Charles Bennett 'the guardian lawfully assigned to Prudence Bennett (his wife) Mary Aris and Saml Aris minors and Amy Aris an infant, children of Samuel Aris late of St Martin Ludgate London widower decd. . . .' (Admin. of Samuel Aris, PCC Admin Act Bk. 1734 f. 204, Somerset House). Queries: was Charles Bennett the apprentice named below, and was Prudence a daughter of a first marriage? I owe the above information to M. A. Byrne of Exeter College, Oxford; its presentation my responsibility. Address : Creed Lane is attested in the Apprentice Registers and elsewhere from 1722, and may have been Aris's only address as master. Creed Lane is said by Robert Seymour to have been 'pestered with Carts and Carrs to Puddle-dock . . . which makes it to be not overwell inhabited' ( Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster , 1734, p. 701). Bindings : 1. Robert Barlow, bd 6 Feb. 1720/1, free 5 Nov. 1728. 2. Thomas Aris, son of Thomas late citizen and barber surgeon of London deceased, bd 1 Oct. 1722, free 4 Nov. 1729. (See below). 3. James Claxton, bd 1 June 1725, turned over to Samuel Palmer 7 March 1731/2, free 7 Nov. 1732. 4. David Henry, bd 1 June 1725, free 5 Feb. 1739/40. 5. Samuel West, bd 2 Sept. 1729 for 8 years, and again 1 Sept. 1730. 6. Charles Bennett, late apprentice of Richard Harbin, 2 June 1730 turned over for the remainder of his term (Stationers' Company Apprentice Registers, Register of Freeman, and Calendar of Masters and Apprentices 1719-62). I have not found in the Company records mention of Aris before 1720/1. The last reference to Samuel senior is dated 3 April 1739, when 'Samuel Aris Son of Samuel late of Creed Lane London Printer deceased' was bound 'to Thomas Aris of Red Lyon Court in Fleetstreet London printer', the Consideration of £10 being paid by Samuel Birt. Thomas Aris's address is earlier given as Jewin St. in bindings 7 Dec. 1731 to 5 Nov. 1734. Thomas Aris's last binding takes place on 3 Feb. 1740/1, which accords well enough with Plomer's statement that Thomas began the Birmingham Gazette , first number 16 November 1741. In his Dictionary 1726-75 Plomer conflates the careers of Samuel senior and junior.</field>

Another copy (Bodley 22863 e.130, n.d.) has C in sheet a (outer forme), w in c (i), W in e (o), but otherwise agrees with the Otago copy. All copies appear to be from the same setting of type, though this has not been checked from forme to forme. There may have been basically only the one impression, though the term becomes blurred in meaning with such use. Differing press-letters in twelve sheets may point to reimpression in these cases for reasons possibly unanswerable, or they may be termed, following W. B. Todd, 'variants of uncertain order' within the impression ( Bibliography of Edmund Burke , 1964, p. 148). The 'third' edition seems to be in the main a reissue with cancel title of sheets of the first printing. Will other copies of the first edition turn up with the press letters as in sheets H I N Q R a and e? The slight and ambiguous evidence suggests that the term 'third edition' constitutes a puff for a poor seller; on the other hand it might indicate reimpression to cope with a continuing demand.

Another copy of the 'second' edition (BM 10856 de.1) agrees with BM G.4352 except in sheet M, which has W . All copies appear to be substantially if not entirely from the same setting, though this has not been checked for every forme. Alternation between two letters in twenty-three sheets suggests that for these sheets at least there were two impressions. Those sheets with no change in letter would represent either overprinting (of the last sheets of text and the preliminaries) or reimpression at the same press. Copies of the first and 'second' editions have evidently been made up indiscriminately from sheets in these varying states, so that priority of impression is impossible to tell from this evidence alone. Perhaps the publisher increased his original order of copies and puffed dropping sales with a 'second' edition. 15. ___ KING (William).

      <field name="heading_text">Four Children's Books by A. A. Milne by John R. Payne *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If a writer, why not write On whatever comes in sight? So — the Children's Books: a short Intermezzo of a sort: When I wrote them, little thinking All my years of pen-and-inking Would be almost lost among Those four trifles for the young. 1 This brief comment on A. A. Milne's literary career is perhaps more apt today than when he wrote it in 1952. He was never happy to be considered a children's author but preferred to be known as a dramatist. After his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he edited the undergraduate paper, The Granta , Milne's career developed in three definite stages. After graduation he free-lanced for three years before accepting the assistant editorship of Punch in 1906. He contributed many of the light verses and essays that appeared in that magazine for the following eight years and thereby established his reputation as a journalist and humorist. With the advent of World War I, Milne joined the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and for the first time found the leisure to write plays. It was to the drama that Milne was most devoted and therein that he made his strongest claim for literary distinction. He became one of England's successful post-War dramatists with such plays as Mr. Pim Passes By , The Dover Road and The Truth about Blayds . The third stage in Milne's career was inspired by his son, Christopher Robin, and was begun by a request for a contribution to a children's magazine in 1923. After declining because he felt that children's literature was not in his line, Milne submitted "The Dormouse and the Doctor" and was unknowingly on his way to becoming famous as a writer for children. Other verses were added to "The Dormouse" and published in 1924 as When We Were Very Young . The popular success of this volume led inevitably to Winnie-the-Pooh (1926), a second volume of nonsense rhymes, Now We Are Six (1927), and another Pooh book, The House at Pooh Corner (1928). Following publication of When We Were Very Young , Milne tried in vain to make the playwright keep up with the children's author. He hated being referred to as "whimsical" and resented being remembered primarily for his light verse. Regardless of his wishes, however, it seems certain that the four books described in this paper will remain his most famous works and the basis of his literary reputation. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Printing orders were given for When We Were Very Young on 17 September, 1924 for 110 large paper copies on hand-made paper and 5140 regular trade copies. The printing of the trade copies was completed by 5 November (with 35 overs) and bound, along with 10 traveller's samples, between 21 October and 2 December, 1924. 3 One hundred thirteen copies on hand-made paper were printed by 3 October. Publication date was 6 November, 1924, and a copy of the limited printing was registered for copyright in the British Museum on 11 November. Of importance to collectors is the presence or absence of printed end-papers in copies of this first printing. It is often quoted that printed end-papers are present in some regular trade copies and absent in others, the inference being that those copies with plain end-papers are an earlier issue. The records show, however, that printed end-papers were not ordered until 18 November, six days after the second trade impression had been ordered, and were first used in copies of the second impression. Thus the complete first impression has plain white end-papers, and the use of printed end-papers began only with the second impression. When We Were Very Young was enthusiastically received, and on 7 November electroplates were made for further printings. On 12 November a second trade impression of 5182 copies was ordered, and this was followed by four additional printings during 1924 totaling 43,843 copies. These same plates were used through the 15th printing of 7 December, 1926. On 2 June, 1927 and again on 13 December, 1940, type was reset and new electroplates were made. The publishers have not distinguished between "edition" and "impression" in their production records; each new printing is called a new "edition." By McKerrow's definitions of edition and impression 4 the printing of 12 November, 1924 is actually the second impression of the first edition, even though it is the first printing from the first set of electroplates. Likewise, those books of the "16th edition" are actually the first impression of the second edition, printed from the second set of electroplates prepared on 2 June, 1927. And books designated as "32nd edition" are the first impression of the third edition, printed from the third set of electroplates prepared on 13 December, 1940. A summary of the printing of each of the four books under discussion will be found in the table at the end. Information includes: 1) title and edition; 2) dates of the original setting of type and subsequent electroplates; 3) dates printing was ordered; 4) number of copies printed. The success of When We Were Very Young resulted in a second children's book, Winnie-the-Pooh . Methuen's confidence in Winnie is evidenced by their ordering two sets of electroplates before printing had begun. This was on 13 August, 1926. Three days later printing orders were given for 365 large paper copies on hand-made paper and 24 copies on Japanese vellum. These were advertised as 350 on hand-made paper and 20 on Japanese vellum. 35,000 regular trade copies were ordered printed on 17 August. Of these, 30,000 were printed by 31 August and ordered bound the same day. These were received from the binder, along with 11 traveller's samples, between 3 September and 13 October, 1926. They were placed on sale 14 October, 1926, and one of the 24 copies on Japanese vellum was registered for copyright in the British Museum on 3 November. An additional 3000 copies of the first trade impression were printed by 11 September and ordered bound in red, blue, and green leather by Burn the same day. It was not until 8 October, 1926, that printing was completed for the remaining 2000 trade copies (with 67 overs), along with the 365 copies on hand-made paper (with 7 overs), and the 24 copies on Japanese vellum (with 3 overs). Binding was completed for the regular trade copies by 20 October; the copies on hand-made paper by 29 October; and the copies on Japanese vellum by 18 November. The same set of electroplates was used through the 27th impression of 26 November, 1941. Type was reset, new electroplates made, and the first impression of the second edition was ordered printed on 9 March, 1942. This is called the "28th edition" by Methuen. The old electroplates were melted down on 23 March and the second setting of type was distributed on 28 September, 1942. Now We Are Six was Milne's next children's book. Electroplates were made of the first type setting on 21 July, 1927. On 3 August printing orders were given for 50,000 regular trade copies, 218 large paper copies on hand-made paper, and 26 copies on Japanese vellum. By 23 August printing was completed for 40,000 trade copies and the complete impressions on vellum and hand-made paper. 5 On the same day all copies were ordered bound. The trade copies were bound and returned to Methuen between 28 May and 6 October, 1927. The copies on hand-made paper were bound between 1 September and 7 October, and the copies on Japanese vellum between 14 September and 1 October. Publication date was 13 October, 1927, and one of the 26 copies on Japanese vellum was registered for copyright at the British Museum on the same day. Of the remaining 10,000 regular trade copies, 5048 were ordered bound in cloth on 10 September and were received from the binder between 6 October and 15 October. The final 5000 trade copies were ordered bound in leather by Ship Binding Company on 13 September: 1500 copies each in blue and green leather, and 2000 copies in red. Binding was completed between 17 September, 1927 and 2 November, 1928. The same set of electroplates was used through the 18th impression of 9 March, 1942. Type was reset, new electroplates made, and the first impression of the second edition was ordered printed on 9 June, 1942. This is called the "19th edition" by Methuen. Type was distributed on 28 September, 1942, and the old electroplates were melted down on 8 October, 1942. The last of Milne's books to be discussed is The House at Pooh Corner . Electroplates were made of the first type setting on 14 August, 1928. Printing orders were given the same day for 75,000 regular trade copies, 360 copies on hand-made paper, and 28 copies on Japanese vellum. Forty-five thousand one hundred seventy-seven trade copies were printed by 23 August and ordered bound the same day. The binding of these, along with 300 traveller's samples, was completed between 23 June and 31 October. By 7 September, 25,100 additional trade copies had been printed. Twenty thousand of these were ordered bound the same day by Ship Binding Company and were completed by 27 November. Also on 7 September an additional binding order went out to Ship for 4000 trade copies to be bound in leather: 1200 in blue, 1200 in green, and 1600 in red. Binding of these 4000 copies was completed by 3 October, 1929. By 10 September the 28 special copies on Japanese vellum and the 360 copies on hand-made paper (with 13 overs) had been printed and ordered bound. The Japanese vellum copies were bound by 10 October and the copies on hand-made paper by 11 October. Publication date was 11 October, 1928, and one of the 28 copies on Japanese vellum was registered for copyright at the British Museum on 17 October. On 11 October an additional binding order for 4524 trade copies was given to Ship. These were returned by 4 January, 1929. A final binding order was given on 4 January, 1929, for 150 trade copies to be bound in blue leather. These were completed by 12 February, 1929. The same set of electroplates was used through the 16th impression of 9 March, 1942. Type was reset, new electroplates made, and the first impression of the second edition was ordered printed on 9 June, 1942. This is called the "17th edition" by Methuen.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Chainlines Versus Imposition in Incunabula by Curt F. Bühler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bibliographers 1 have almost unanimously agreed that the descriptive terms Folio, Quarto and Octavo 2 refer to the number of times the original sheet of paper had been folded. The sheet folded once, with the chainlines vertical and the watermark in the center of one of the resulting two leaves, forms a folio (2°); folded twice, the chainlines horizontal and the "filigrane" in the middle of the fold, is a quarto (4°). Folded a third time (octavo = 8°), the chainlines are again vertical and the watermark will appear at the top of the inner margin in four leaves. It is also normal to assume that, in a volume with folio leaves, the actual printing (machining) provided two pages on each side of a sheet; in a quarto, four on the same side of each sheet; and in an octavo, eight. 3 There cannot be much doubt that this is true for the vast majority of cases — but it is not always so. 4 Such abnormalities must be taken into consideration whenever the examination of a volume discloses problems which cannot be explained by an analysis based on the norm. When we come to editions described as "Folio and Quarto." or "Quarto and Octavo" are we to believe that some sheets (as in the first instance, for example) were printed as folios and others as quartos? If this were true and since all leaves must necessarily be of the same size, these quarto leaves must have been printed on a very large press (quite different from that used to print the folio leaves) with paper twice the size of that used for the folios. 5 Let us examine a few instances. The Sermones quadragesimales de poenitentia by Robertus Caracciolus, printed in two editions by Franciscus Renner at Venice in 1472, has in both cases the collation: [a-i 10 k 6 l-t 10 u 12 x-z 10 A-C 10 D 12 ]. Both editions are described as "2° und 4°" by the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke . 6 The copy of the earlier edition (GW 6062) 7 in the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich (2°. Inc. c. a. 106) has the following distribution of paper: [a], folio; [b-g], quarto; [h], quarto = 1, 2, 9, 10 + folio = 3-8; [i-k], folio; [l-q], quarto; [r], quarto = 1, 2, 9, 10 + folio = 3-8; [s-u], folio; [x-A], quarto; and [B-D], folio. The identical distribution of paper occurs in the copies in the British Museum (IB. 19827), Walters Art Gallery and the Cambridge University Library (Oates 1653). 8 Renner's second printing (GW 6063), however, provides an interesting clue. Here the leaves in quires [a-m] are all quarto, those in [p-D] are all folio, with quires [n-o] sometimes mixed. In the Munich example (2°. Inc. c. a. 107), these two quires have leaves 1 and 10 in quarto, the rest are folio. The Cambridge copy (Oates 1654) has quire [n] as the Munich one, while the example in the Pierpont Morgan Library (PML 20486) has the entire quire as folio. Both the Cambridge and the Morgan copies have all quire [o] in folio. In short, certain leaves are found either as folios or quartos, 9 though close examination shows that they are otherwise identical. 10 Surely it seems unlikely that the printer would re-arrange his formes for these leaves, and one may presume that they were all machined in the same manner. From this analysis, it seems highly probable that the entire book (as well as the earlier edition) was printed as a folio — and that the quarto leaves are merely the result of double-sheets having been cut in half 11 and printed with two pages to each side. 12 Thus, quarto sheets 13 can be used for printing by "folio-imposition". 14 In effect, any large-sized quarto could actually be a folio, when considered from the printer's point of view as opposed to the bibliographer's. Even more curious cases — and perhaps more enlightening — are those of certain mixed 4° and 8° volumes, in particular two undated publications (probably of the late 1470s) by Johannes Schurener in Rome: Modestus, De re militari , and Solinus, De mirabilibus mundi . So far as the Modestus is concerned, my own copy, which collates: [a 8 b 12 c 10 ], agrees with that in the British Museum (BMC IV:59 — IA. 17768) in the fact that "the inner sheet of quire [a] and the two outer sheets of quire [b] are quarto". But in quire [a], my copy has a watermark in only the first and second leaves, 15 the wrong two leaves since in full octavo folding one expects to find the watermarks in either of these four leaves: 1, 4, 5 and 8 or 2, 3, 6 and 7. 16 Furthermore, one of the two inner sheets is quarto and the other is octavo. They could never, therefore, have been conjoined. In quire [b], a watermark appears in my copy only on [b]4 (an octavo leaf), showing that this sheet was never attached to any other sheet(s) in this particular signature. In quire [c], a watermark appears only on the sixth and seventh leaves — but not in any other. These facts would seem to preclude the possibility that the machining was carried on in such fashion as to print either four or eight pages on one side of a sheet of paper and then binding these sheets together. The Solinus (collation: [a 4 b-i 10 k-l 8 m-n 10 ]) 17 offers even further complications. The British Museum's description (BMC IV:59) of its two copies points out that both have the second and third sheets of quire [l] as quarto and that, in IA. 17771, the outer sheet of quire [a] is also quarto, though octavo in IA. 17772 (G. 8938). So far as concerns quire [l], it is instructive to consider the Cambridge University Library copy (Oates 1410), for in this volume only the second sheet is quarto. 18 Accordingly, only a single sheet of quarto is found in a signature of eight leaves, otherwise octavo. One wonders where the other half of this sheet, if printed, is to be found. A close comparison of the quarto and octavo leaves of [a]1 and [a]4 indicates that these were printed from the same setting of type. 19 Further, IA. 17771 proves conclusively that the first quire must have been machined as two separate sheets, with only two pages printed on each side. In short, these seem to have been printed on rather a small press with imposition as in folio. The same "mixed foldings" can also be found north of the Alps. As a characteristic example, one may cite the Psalterium Germanicum , [Strassburg: Heinrich Eggestein, c. 1475 = Goff P-1074]. The collation is somewhat complicated, and BMC I:74 20 suggests the formula: [a-f 10 g 8 + 2 h 8 + 1 i-k 10 ]. This does not, however, tell the whole story, since Eggestein apparently had considerable difficulty with the imposition. Actually, in quire [c], leaves 7 through 10 are mounted on stubs in both the Morgan (PML 26106) and the Scheide copies, 21 and so also is [h]9 in the former copy (wanting in the latter). The Scheide (though not the Morgan) example also has [b]10 mounted on a stub. In the Morgan example, quires [a] and [i] are octavo, all the other leaves being quarto except [k]4.7 (octavo). 22 But this sheet is also quarto in the Scheide volume! The watermarks also supply interesting evidence. In the octavo quire [a] of both copies, watermarks appear only on leaves 2 and 4 of PML 26106 and on 3 and 5 of the Scheide copy. This would be impossible if the sheet had been printed with the usual eight pages on one side of the sheet. Again, in the Morgan quarto quire [d], watermarks appear on eight of the ten leaves (only 3.8 being without a mark), an impossibility if printing had been carried on in the normal quarto manner. There seems to be no other explanation available but to assume that the printing proceeded on half-sheets of normal paper and quarter-sheets of the double paper, but in each case with only two pages on each side of every sheet (that is, as in folio printing). It thus became possible for the pressman to print the entire inner or outer forme with a single pull of the lever. 23 The material set forth above 24 leads to the conclusion that "format" for the fifteenth-century printer occasionally represented something quite different from what it does to the twentieth-century bibliographer. The researcher must needs be wary of traps of this sort which may lie in wait for him; that he cannot, for example, judge the number of pages originally printed on one side of a sheet of paper by the position of the chainlines and the watermarks.</field>

C. T. Oates, A Catalogue of the Fifteenth-Century Printed Books in the University Library Cambridge (1954), nos. 1653-54; but Marie Pellechet, Catalogue général des incunables des bibliothèques publiques de France (1897-1909), no. 3246 simply states "in-fol." 7 The collation itself suggests that the book was not printed with four pages to a side of the sheet, since a large majority of the quires have ten leaves, which would have required two quarto sheets and a half-sheet. This would have caused awkward and unnecessary problems that would have been avoided with signatures of eight leaves. 8 "The book was thus printed in three sections, the first two of ten quires each, the last of seven quires" (BMC V:191). But quire [a], with the "tabula," would surely be the last printed, and the fact that the paper is folio (while the other early quires are quarto) suggests that it was actually machined after the folio signatures [B-D]. The distribution in the second edition may well suggest that Renner was using two presses and that two quires were always being printed simultaneously. Further, that the change in paper occurred when each press was printing the seventh quire allotted to it. 9 See also Pope Pius II, Dialogus de somnio quodam , Rome: Johannes Schurener, 11 Sept. 1475, which has (according to BMC IV:57) the inner sheet of quire [g] as quarto, the rest being folio. However, the Huntington, Morgan and Library of Congress copies are folio throughout. 10 The abbreviations and spacings are the same throughout, as also broken characters. 11 As Bowers points out (p. 194), cutting must be "treated as if it were a folding of the sheet." 12 On such half-sheet imposition, see Dennis E. Rhodes, "Variants in the 1479 Oxford Edition of Aristotle's Ethics," SB , VIII (1956), 209-212; Curt F. Bühler, "The First Edition of Ficino's De christiana religione : a Problem in Bibliographical Description," SB , XVIII (1965), 248-252; etc. 13 The leaf in the Museum's copy of GW 6062 measures 292 x 211 mm., so that the sheet must have been greater than 422 x 292. The double sheet must then have been greater than 600 x 420 mm. These figures may be compared with the size of the "forma regalis" (700 x 500 mm.) and the "forma mediana" (500 x 300 mm.) as cited by Haebler (p. 39). The average size of the Schurener quarto sheets was 210 x 150 mm., which means that the full sheet measured more than 420 x 300 mm. and the double-sheet in excess of 600 x 420 mm. These very large sheets were used in the printing of the over-size incunables. The sheets which the R-Printer used in Strassburg for the printing of the Specula of Vincent of Beauvais must have been greater than 646 x 475 mm. (BMC I:65), and paper of that size was also used by Peter Schoeffer in Mainz (BMC I:27). Judging from the measurements of the Morgan copy of the Golden Legend (PML 780), one deduces that Caxton used a sheet greater than 520 x 388 mm. William Blades ( The Life and Typography of William Caxton [1861-63], II, xvii) asserts that Caxton's largest sheet measured approximately 22 x 16 inches (about 560 x 405 mm.). 14 Bowers, p. 194, and Greg, p. lvi, suggest the notations: (2°-form) 4° and (4°-form) 8°. 15 Actually, one-half of the same watermark appears in the upper margin, somewhat nearer the fold than the center. 16 McKerrow, p. 167. 17 Again this is a very curious (and suspicious) quiring for either quarto or octavo imposition. 18 So also in the copy belonging to the Philip H. and A. S. W. Rosenbach Foundation. In this copy, too, only a single watermark appears in signatures [c], [m] and [n], an impossibility with octavo printing. The copy in the Yale University Library now collates [a-v 4.8 ], but this is a quiring which has been imposed on the book by a binder. The leaves in the Yale copy correspond to the following leaves as they left Schurener's press: Original quiring Yale copy a 4 a1-4 b 10 b1-8 c1+2 c 10 c3+4 d1-8 d 10 e1-4 f1-6 e 10 f7+8 g1-4 h1-4 f 10 h5-8 i1-4 k1+2 g 10 k3-8 l1-4 h 10 m1-8 n1+2 i 10 n3+4 o1-8 k 8 p1-4 q1-4 l 8 q5-8 r1-4 m 10 s1-8 t1+2 n 10 t3+4 v1-8 19 Both have the same broken a in "suffragiū" (l. 9) and the b out of line in "ber" (l. 11) of [a]1 recto, and the same misprint "et ‖ et" (a repeat) in lines 4-5 on the recto of the fourth leaf. 20 The catalogue provides the additional note: "Quires b, c, and g appear to be made up." 21 I am grateful to Mr. William H. Scheide for permitting me to examine his copy at my leisure. 22 If printed as a normal quarto with a single sheet inserted, then the make-up would have been either 1.2.3.4 ∣ 7.8.9.10, with 5.6 inserted, or 1.2.4.5. ∣ 6.7.9.10, with 3.8 inserted. With normal printing, the insertion of 4.7 would have been impossible. 23 Compare McKerrow's observation (p. 61): "I may perhaps surprise some bibliographers by saying that always until about 1800 a normal full-sized forme of type was printed by two pulls of the lever." See also my "Caxton Studies," Gutenberg Jahrbuch 1940 , pp. 169-176. 24 Heawood (p. 45) discusses a further complication in that, on rare occasions, the chain-wires were "placed longitudinally in the mould, giving horizontal lines in a folio book, vertical in a quarto, and so on." Compare also my "Caxton Studies."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The "1584" Publication of Henry Constable's Diana Augmented by Hassell B. Sledd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first publication of a collection of Henry Constable's sonnets, Diana, The Praises of His Mistres, in Certaine Sweete Sonnets (STC 5637), was entered to John Charlewood in the Stationers' Register for September 22, 1592 (Arber II, 620). The collection was augmented and published in two editions as Diana, or the Excellent Conceitful Sonnets of H. C. Augmented with Diuers Quatorzains of Honorable and Lerned Personages (STC 5638), presumably between 1594 and 1598. Neither edition of Diana Augmented was entered in the Stationers' Register, but because of the death of Charlewood in 1593, the remarriage of his widow to James Roberts (Arber V, 171), the transfer of some twenty titles from Charlewood to Roberts on the last day of May, 1594 (Arber II, 651-652), and the printing of the augmented editions by Roberts, we can presume that the augmented editions were not printed before 1594. We can also presume that they were not printed after 1598, because rights to Diana passed to William Wood on November 6, 1598 (Arber III, 131). The earlier edition of Diana Augmented is known in a single copy in the British Museum. The later edition is known in two copies, one in the Bodleian Library and the other in the Huntington Library. On the title page of the later edition "lerned" is changed to "learned". On other pages the editions differ in the positions of signatures, the patterns of ornaments, the spelling, and the use of swash capitals, ligatures, and abbreviations. 1 Bibliographical catalogues treat both editions as one and indicate that the title pages, now cropped, may once have shown "1584." For example, the Short Title Catalogue reads "1584 (or rather 1594)" and the British Museum Catalogue of Printed Books reads "H. C. Diana . . . [1584] . . . . The date supplied is that found in perfect copies; this copy is cropped. The work was published in 1594." In all probability, "1584" never appeared on the title page of either edition; instead, it first appeared in 1818 on the title page of Samuel Weller Singer's facsimile reprint of Diana Augmented . For the reprint, Singer used, as far as it would carry him, the single known copy of the earlier or "lerned" edition. He had access to it through his friend Robert Triphook, who bought it on December 14, 1818, at the sale of James Bindley's library. 2 Singer's reprint agrees with the text of signatures A-E in the spelling of "lerned" on the title page and in sixty-three other occasions of spelling, punctuation, and abbreviation, when the later or "learned" edition differs. The reprint and the "lerned" edition also share an error. On signature E5 v , both offer "woudds" in the verse "a mortall shaft still woudds mee in my mourning," where the "learned" edition offers "wounds". Gathering F was missing from the copy of the "lerned" edition, according to Bindley's Catalogue (p. 36). For the text of this gathering Singer used a copy of the "learned" edition or the Roxburghe Club reprint. 3 Because these and Singer's reprint agree, I am unable to determine which Singer used. The date had probably been cropped from the title page of each of the known copies before Singer had access to them. The copy of the "lerned" edition is dated in Bindley's Catalogue as 1604 (p. 36). But this date is obviously wrong, for Roberts printed the book, and rights to it passed to Wood in 1598. So wrong a date implies cropping of the title page before the book was catalogued for Bindley's sale, rather than a mistake on the part of the cataloguer. The title page of the Bodleian copy of the "learned" edition had evidently long been cropped, for it had been listed without a date in the 1698 catalogue of the library of Dr. Francis Bernard, 4 and it had been dated by Thomas Warton as both 1596 5 and 1592 6 The title page of the Huntington copy is not genuine 7 and seems to have been missing before the copy came to light in this century. The copy was first mentioned by Dr. A. S. W. Rosenbach in a note now inside the cover of a copy of Venus and Adonis (STC 22356) in the Folger Library. In the note Diana Augmented, Venus and Adonis , and four other tracts are described as bound together; all are dated 1595. 8 The date of Diana Augmented seems to have been inferred on the strength of the dates of some of the other tracts. Because the date had presumably been cropped from the title page of the copy of Diana Augmented used by Singer for most of his reprint, and because in the other known copies of the book the date had presumably been cropped or the title page itself was missing, it seems reasonable to say that "1584" never appeared on the title page of any copy of the sixteenth-century Diana Augmented , but rather orginated in 1818 in Singer's reprint.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Thomas Creede's Pica Roman by W. Craig Ferguson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Founts of type are much more distinctive than has been assumed, and provide a field for detailed study. Hitherto, attention has concentrated on broken types, which are ephemeral, or on punches and matrices, which are of limited use in identifying an individual printer. I decided to undertake a pilot project, and have chosen to look at pica roman types used in England between 1590 and 1610. I am working alphabetically through the sixty or seventy printers involved, and as Creede presents an interesting case, I thought a preliminary report on this printer's types might be in order. At this stage I am working from the microfilms available in University Microfilms' STC series and Xerox copies of selected pages provided by the Huntington Library. My findings will need confirmation later from the books themselves. Thomas Creede began printing in 1593. At that time he used a fount of pica roman type 1 which had definite characteristics often found together. Isaac noted one characteristic of this fount, the letter 'g' with the loop larger than the bowl. 2 This is only one characteristic of this particular fount, and others are perhaps more distinctive. The 'k' of this fount has a rather squat appearance, the two arms of the letter more or less forming a square; much more common in this period are shorter arms at sharper angles, forming a narrow vertical rectangle. In modern terms, an expanded letter rather than a condensed. With the expanded 'k', logically, is an expanded 'x' in which the two strokes meet at about 90°, and an expanded 'z', which is also squarish in appearance. The counter in the 'o' is slanted decidedly to the left. The serif at the base of the descender of the 'p' is to the right of the stem. The 'u' at times prints more heavily than the other letters. The fount on the whole seems slightly worn. One of the most interesting letters is the 'i'. There is a mixture found in this fount, as the dots over the letter are found either directly above the body of the letter or slightly to the left of it. Mixtures of this sort are distinctive, and will become increasingly useful as we shall see, but I feel that the 'dot left' letter deserves some comment. This position is unusual. Most early romans placed the dot either directly above the letter or to the right. The preference in most continental founts was to the right, and so far the earliest example I have found of a 'dot left' is in Chiromance by Joan de Indagine, printed by Jean de Tournes in Lyons, 1549. 3 The earliest illustration of an English use I have encountered is in a book printed by the assigns of John Wayland in 1557. 4 This, the first pica roman Creede used, I designate fount # 1. He used it in two books printed in 1593, and in all seven books assigned by Morrison to 1594. 5 However, during the printing of The first part of the Tragicall raigne of Selimus ( STC 12310a), which I assume was late in the year, a second fount was introduced and a most interesting transformation took place. Sheets A and B were printed from fount # 1, as were the outer formes of sheets C to E. With the exception of part of C4, the inner formes of sheets C and D were printed from a second fount. Fount # 2 is characterized by a narrow, or condensed, 'k', a 'centre dot' 'i', an 'o' with the counter being either vertical or slanted to the right, a 'p' with a small counter and the serif at the base of the descender to the left of the stem, and some 'w' which seems a trifle large for the fount. Again, it does not give the appearance of being fresh. Both founts are relatively pure up to sheet E, but at this point Creede proceeded to mix the two founts indiscriminately, presumably by distributing the type to the wrong cases; by sheet G the two founts are indistinguishable from one another. Happily, for purposes of identification, this 'new' fount, designated fount # 3, is most distinctive, and was used by Creede in all the books I have seen printed by him in pica roman from 1595 until 1603. Fount # 3 is characterized, then, by a mixture of 'i' dotted left or centre, the two forms of 'k', three forms of 'o': the counter being slanted either way or vertical, the 'p' with the serif on the descender being either to the left or to the right, the former having small counters, an occasional heavy 'u', and some 'w' which seems a bit deep for the fount. The letter 'g' remains constant, the loop being larger than the bowl, and both 'x' and 'z' remain in the expanded form only. There were one or two changes as the years went by. In 1598 we find the supply of 'g' has been supplemented by several pieces with small loops. Another rather odd addition was the introduction of at least three pieces of black letter 'y e ' to the fount. This occurs very infrequently, but is observed in later founts as well. Perhaps Creede simply borrowed from his black letter fount when the occasion arose. This fount was replaced in 1603 by fount # 4. This fount was characterized by expanded 'k', 'x', and 'z', a centre dot 'i', an 'o' with the counter leaning to the left, and an unusually condensed 'u'. This letter is most noticeable when contrasted with the normal 'n': usually the two letters are the same set. The serif on the 'p' is both to the right and left of the stem, and the 'g' again has a large loop. The fount does not appear to have been of the best quality. A fifth fount appeared briefly in 1606 in one book I have been able to see, Thomas Bell's The regiment of the Church ( STC 1827), where it was used to print the last two sheets. It replaced fount # 4 in 1609. The most obvious characteristic of fount # 5 is the 'w', which has a short second stem which runs into the third stem half-way down its length. As Isaac remarks, this "closes up the letter" 6 and gives it a rather squashed appearance, especially when seen in context. Fount # 5 contains a centre dot 'i', a mixture of 'o' with most counters being vertical, but some slanting slightly either way, a mixture of 'k' with condensed forms predominating, a mixture of 'g' with most pieces having a small loop, and a condensed 'x' and 'z'. Many of the capital letters used with this fount are just a shade smaller than they should be, and do not reach quite as high as the lower-case ascenders. Again there was some mixing, and in 1613 one book ( STC 16830) has a mixture of 'w', with some pieces having stems of equal length. The sixth fount appeared in 1613, and is the clearest, if the least distinctive, of Creede's pica romans. The 'i' is centre dot, 'k', 'x', and 'z' are narrow, the 'o' counter is basically vertical, with some pieces leaning slightly to the left, the loop of the 'g' is only slightly larger than the bowl. The serif on the 'p' is usually crisp, and extends to both sides of the stem. This fount was used by Creede until he ceased production in 1617. The following is a list of STC numbers of the Creede books containing pica roman which I have seen on microfilm. They are grouped chronologically according to the fount used. At the end is a list of books which were printed entirely without pica roman; the remainder of Creede's output I have not seen yet. I count as unseen a sizeable group of microfilms which, regrettably, do not have a scale for comparison.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I use this term in preference to '82 roman' as there is slight variation in measurement from fount to fount. However, twenty lines of pica measure about 82mm., or six lines to the inch, or twelve point.

      <field name="heading_text">John Warburton's Lost Plays by John Freehafer</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Folio 1 of British Museum MS Lansdowne 807 contains a two-part list of "Manuscripts" of about 56 old plays, which are said to have been owned by John Warburton (1682-1759), Somerset Herald. This list has appended to it a memorandum in which Warburton said, "After I had been many years Collecting these MSS Playes, through my own carelesness and the Ignora[n]ce of my Ser[vant] in whose hands I had lodgd them they was unluckely burnd or put under Pye bottoms, excepting y e three which followes." 1 This list and memorandum form part of a bound volume which contains three surviving plays and part of a fourth play. Warburton's collection has won fame because of its shameful fate and his claim to have owned many irreplaceable plays by eminent older English dramatists, including Shakespeare. 2 In a jocose letter prefixed to his Fortunes of Nigel (1822), Sir Walter Scott typically portrayed Warburton as "the painful collector, but ah! the too careless custodian, of the largest collection of ancient plays ever known." Since Warburton ascribed a dozen of the lost plays to Massinger, it is not surprising that William Gifford, a notably quick-tempered editor, in his 1805 edition of Massinger denounced Warburton for having allowed "treasures which ages may not reproduce" to be "burnt from an economical wish to save him the charges of more valuable brown paper" (I, xviii-xix n). In his reissue of that edition in 1813, Gifford speculated that it would have taken at least ten years for Warburton's cook to use up fifty plays in covering "her pies" (I, vii). Gifford's story of Warburton, his cook, and her pies was not seriously challenged for a century. In 1911, after noting other possibilities, W. W. Greg suggested as his "own idea of what happened" that Warburton's list was a largely unfilled want list, "containing the titles of such pieces as he thought it might be possible to recover," compiled from "various sources," but chiefly from entries of unprinted plays in the Stationers' Register by the famous play publisher Humphrey Moseley, who died in 1660/61. Greg finally suggested that "we have undoubtedly to lament the loss of a few pieces, . . . but not by any means the dramatic holocaust that has made famous the name of the 'pie-eating Somerset Herald.'" (II, 258-259). Since 1911 various commentators have agreed or disagreed with Greg's suggestion, but no one has examined it in detail, although it is important to know whether Warburton owned the numerous and significant plays that he listed because, as Greg said, "upon the answer depends most of the value of the evidence the list affords." 3 Although Greg said, "There is no doubt that Warburton was acquainted with the bulk entrances made by Humphrey Moseley in the Register," 4 it is not known that Warburton consulted the Stationers' Register. Bishop Tanner made extracts from the Register in 1699, but no other scholar is known to have consulted it until nineteen years after Warburton's death. 5 Furthermore, Warburton's list differs greatly from the Register entries of unprinted plays. Of about 145 unpublished plays of pre-Restoration date which were entered in the Register, only 36 appear in Warburton's list. If Warburton searched the Register to compile a want list, it is strange that he copied less than a quarter of the pertinent items, ignored entries by all stationers other than Moseley, and omitted more than half of the unpublished plays entered by Moseley. Furthermore, the order of the items in Warburton's list shows no correlation with the order of Moseley's Register entries; no two successive entries in Warburton's long list follow the same order as any two successive items in the Register. Whereas Warburton's list appears not to be systematically arranged, the plays in Moseley's long entries of September 9, 1653 and June 29, 1660 are massed by authors and, in the 1653 entry, the authors are arranged in recognizable, though not precise, alphabetical order. What is more, sixteen scattered items in Warburton's list can not have been copied from the Register, because they do not appear in it. In 1958 Greg acknowledged the difficulty he had created by asking us to "assume that the titles of the two classes got mixed in compiling the list," adding that "it is not altogether easy to see how this occurred." 6 Greg's suggestion that Warburton might have copied some of these sixteen listings from the "Registers from 1640 onwards" (II, 256) was proved valueless when publication of those Registers (in 1913-14) revealed no previously unknown entry that corresponded to any Warburton listing. Greg also saw the need to reject his original suggestion that Warburton might have derived some entries from the Master of the Revels' "Office Book." 7 Edmond Malone apparently was the first scholar to examine that Office Book, thirty years after Warburton's death. 8 Warburton's list also lacks the deletions which he might have made if, as Greg suggested, it was originally a mere want list of items of which Warburton actually obtained some at later dates. A comparison of details of items on Warburton's list with those of the corresponding Register entries further suggests that Warburton did not copy the Register. Although Greg cited Warburton's listing of The Second Maiden's Tragedy as "definite evidence" that Warburton copied the Register (II, 255), that listing can not be a mere copy of the Register, because Warburton specifies a supposed author of the play ("Geo. Chapman"), whereas the Register lists none. Chapman is the second of three authors named in the existing manuscript of this play, where his name is now deleted. Recognizing that Warburton could not have copied the attribution of the play to Chapman from a Register entry that does not mention Chapman, Greg said, "There surely can be little doubt that Warburton had this entry as well as the manuscript play before him when he entered the latter in his own list" (II, 256). It seems unlikely, however, that Warburton would have entered the play in a list of "such pieces as he thought it might be possible to recover" if he already had "the manuscript play before him." Warburton's listing of The Second Maiden's Tragedy is one of many listings that he can not have merely copied from the Register, because he adds significant information that is not to be found in the corresponding Register entries. In ten other such listings, Warburton designates as comedies, tragicomedies, or tragedies plays that are not so designated in the Register. In five of these ten cases, the type of play is indicated in no known original source other than Warburton's list. 9 Warburton's designations of The Bugbears as a comedy and The Queen of Corsica as a tragedy are corroborated by existing manuscripts. His designation of The Crafty Merchant as a comedy is confirmed by an entry in Herbert's Office Book, which Warburton did not see. Of the ten listings, one is apparently wrong, for The Governor is a tragicomedy, whereas Warburton called it a tragedy. 10 In a significant number of cases, therefore, Warburton supplies information about Moseley plays which appears to be correct and is not found in the Register. This suggests that Warburton had access to a source or sources of information other than the Register. Warburton further reveals his independence of the Register by omitting a dozen spurious subtitles which appear in Register entries. In each of these entries Moseley has listed two plays as if they were but one play with a title and subtitle. This practice, which apparently was intended to save on fees for entering plays, was made possible by a Star Chamber decree of 1637, which took the licensing of plays for the press out of the hands of the Masters of the Revels, who were unlikely to allow such frauds. John Okes made the first such spurious entry on November 28, 1637. 11 A typical example of this frugal but risky practice is provided by Moseley's entry of "Alexius the Chast Gallant or. The Bashfull Lover . . . . by Phill: Massinger," for this single entry covers two distinct plays, which had been separately licensed for the stage. The Bashful Lover is in print, and the alternate title Alexius the Chast Gallant does not suit it. Thus, the Register entry is spurious, whereas Warburton's separate listing of "Alexias or y e chast Glallant" ( sic ) substantially agrees with an official stage license. Moseley entered at least 26 plays in spurious entries. Of these Warburton lists twelve without reproducing a spurious subtitle. 12 Warburton could scarcely have omitted all of these twelve carefully concealed errors, if he copied his listings from the Register. Warburton also has avoided another subtle error that appears in the Register. In 1660 Moseley entered "The Tale of Ioconda and Astolso. a Comedy . . . by Tho: Decker." This play presumably dealt with Jocundo and Astolfo in Ariosto's Orlando Furioso . Although the second name (at least) is wrongly given in the Register, Warburton correctly lists "Jocondo &amp; Astolfo C. Tho. Decker." It is possible that Warburton knew the Ariostan source and silently corrected an error; but it is as likely that the Stationers' Clerk misread an "f" as a long "s" in an unfamiliar proper name, whereas Warburton copied from a different source in which "Astolfo" appeared correctly. It is unlikely that Warburton, in the course of copying 40 brief entries from the Register, could have made substantial changes in 28 cases, at least 16 of which involve additions or corrections to the information in the Register. Although Greg suggests that the Register "would account for perhaps three quarters" of Warburton's list (II, 256), there is not a single Warburton listing that agrees precisely with the Register, and only about a fifth of his listings are of a sort that even a careless copyist could have derived from the Register, because the remaining four fifths either do not appear in the Register, or are fuller than the Register entries, or omit errors in the Register. This suggests that Warburton did not derive his information about the Moseley plays (or any others) from the Register. The presence of titles of printed works on Warburton's list of "Manuscripts" further suggests that it was not a want list of unprinted plays. "The fair favourit" had been printed in the Davenant folio of 1673, and Warburton would have had no apparent occasion to include "S r . Jo n . Sucklings Workes" in a list of "such pieces as he thought it might be possible to recover." Warburton may also have had "Manuscripts" of two printed works by Elkanah Settle — Fatal Love (1680) and The Fairy Queen (1692). Since manuscripts of printed plays were regarded as virtually valueless in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 13 it is unlikely that Warburton would have specifically sought them out. Presumably he obtained these "Manuscripts" of printed works as parts of manuscript collections that also included unpublished plays. The testimony of Warburton's memorandum has been challenged on the ground that he was untruthful, but Warburton's contemporaries and immediate successors seem to have found him veracious; certainly they accepted his account of his play collection. Citing what he described as "general evidence of character," Greg deemed it "intrinsically probable" that Warburton was "a liar" (II, 252); but William Hutton, a younger contemporary of Warburton who had closely studied his work, pronounced him "judicious" and expressly praised him "for his veracity." 14 The suggestion that Warburton falsely claimed (in a private memorandum) to have owned old plays to gain fame as a collector takes no account of either the low valuation of play manuscripts in the eighteenth century or the fact that those plays could have formed only a small and seemingly unimportant part of his large collection. Warburton collected many valuable manuscripts relating to every part of England, which he classified and had bound in numerous volumes. 15 "He had an amazing collection of MSS. books, prints, &amp;c. relating to the History and Antiquities of England, which were sold by auction, after his death," on six evenings in November 1759. 16 In 1720 Humphrey Wanley, the scholarly and tight-fisted librarian of the celebrated Harleian Collection, went "to M r Warburton, &amp; offer'd him 100 Guineas for his old MSS &amp;c." 17 Warburton demanded three hundred guineas, but eventually accepted Wanley's offer, 18 at a time when a manuscript of an old play might sell for a shilling. Although Warburton thus had little reason to regard his play manuscripts as important, he reported the destruction of most of them with mortification, and bound together three of the surviving plays. Greg and others have speculated that Warburton's servant and her destruction of his unbound play manuscripts might be creations of folklore. 19 About the time of Warburton's birth, however, Dryden, in "MacFlecknoe," chose Herringman — who came into possession of much of Moseley's stock — to be captain of the "Bilk'd stationers" whose unsold books and plays became "Martyrs of pies" (lines 101-105). This seemingly prescient reference to the subsequent fate of plays that may have passed through Herringman's hands on the way to Warburton's reveals not so much a gift of prophecy as accurate observation of an age in which grocers, tobacconists, and cooks sought scrap paper, which was neither cheap nor plentiful. In Act I of Peter Motteux' Farewel Folly (1707), Mimic says of a group of play manuscripts, "We have such heaps of Tragedies, Comedies, Farces, Masques, Opera's, and what not, in the House, that we had twenty pounds bidden for 'em by a Grocer and a Pastry Cook." Thus, the reduction of fifty unbound play manuscripts to scrap paper is horrendous, but not improbable. Indeed, a cheesemonger once offered £10 for fifty volumes of the papers of Sir Julius Caesar, Master of the Rolls to James I and Charles I, which now form part of the same collection as the volume of Warburton plays. 20 Warburton's memorandum thus offers a plausible explanation for the loss of fifty plays that once existed. The fact that Warburton's younger contemporaries and immediate successors accepted his acount of his plays and their destruction has been obscured by Greg's statement that the Warburton list "was first printed, at a time when the manuscript was still in the possession of the first Marquis of Lansdowne, by Reed in his 'Variorum' Shakespeare of 1803" (II, 227). Actually, Reed had printed the same list ten years earlier and had mentioned a still earlier list in which Malone referred to some of the Warburton plays. 21 Malone's list, which appeared in January 1778 as part of An Attempt to Ascertain the Order in which the Plays Attributed to Shakespeare were Written , 22 included "the names of several ancient plays . . . which are not known to have been ever printed," but which might "be yet in being" in manuscript. 23 This list of 34 plays shows that Malone knew of the Warburton collection in 1778, because it includes Demetrius and Marina , a play which is not recorded prior to the sale of Warburton's library in 1759, 24 and " The honoured Loves ," which can scarcely be anything but a misreading of Warburton's "The Hon r . Loves," in which "the superior letter resembles a 'd.'" 25 Malone's list of 1778 includes ten plays that have been associated with Warburton, but his listing of " The Nobleman , by Cyril Tourneur" must be disregarded, because Malone derived it from a schedule of plays "acted in the year 1613," which he found in a copy of Lord Stanhope's accounts in Bodleian MS Rawlinson A239. 26 Of the nine other Warburton plays listed by Malone in 1778 as perhaps "yet in being," five still exist in manuscript, 27 while another two survived Warburton's death, since they appear in the sale catalogue. 28 Since Malone owned the manuscript of The Parliament of Love , 29 which Warburton attributed to William Rowley, he may have assumed that the two other plays attributed by Warburton to the same writer — The Four Honourable Loves and The Nonesuch — were likely survivors from Warburton's collection. Although Malone may have erred in these two cases, it is clear that he had substantial information about Warburton's plays before 1778. Since Malone did not include the remaining 46 Warburton items on a list that was intended to include all the old plays that he thought might be found in manuscript, it may be suspected that Malone had concluded, no later than 1778, that those 46 plays were no longer "in being" in manuscript form. In 1780 Malone published additions to his list of old plays that might have survived in manuscript, which he revised and expanded further for publication in 1785 and later; 30 but he never added to that list any of the Warburton plays that he had not included in 1778. The additions by Malone, Reed, and Steevens to the new edition of David E. Baker's Biographia Dramatica (1782) 31 include more than fifty unnoted references to Warburton's play collection, which constitute a substantial reprint of Warburton's memorandum and list. The first such separate entry of a Warburton play reckons Beauty in a Trance "among those destroyed by Mr. Warburton's servant" (II, 30), and 37 other entries of single plays include similar statements. "The general havock made by Mr. Warburton's servant" is noted several times (see, for example, II, 148), and the destruction of Duke Humphrey , supposedly by Shakespeare, evokes the following comment: "Could we believe it to have been really written by him, what a subject of regret would its ill fate be to every admirer of our immortal poet!" (II, 95). Thus, in 1778, and more fully in 1782, Malone indicated acceptance of Warburton's statement that most of his play manuscripts had been destroyed, but correctly suggested that the surviving plays numbered more than the three specified in Warburton's memorandum. The 1782 Biographia Dramatica lists the three plays that survive in Warburton's bound volume as "in MS. in the library of lord Shelburne" (II, 38, 296, 331); Shelburne did not become Marquis of Lansdowne until 1784. Greg noted that "Warburton and Shelburne book-plates" are mounted on a preliminary leaf in Lansdowne MS 807 (II, 230). Shelburne did not purchase this volume at the Warburton sale, however. In 1759 he was merely Lord Fitzmaurice, and three months prior to the sale he had fought in the battle of Minden. He returned to England in 1760, and became seriously interested in collecting manuscripts in 1765. 32 James West, Treasurer and later President of the Royal Society, probably was the unrecorded purchaser in 1759. As Malone noted, West was interested in literary works; 33 and he bought "part of Warburton's collection" of manuscripts. 34 After West's death, "his curious collection of MSS. were sold to William Earl of Shelburne (afterwards first Marquis of Lansdowne)," 35 who apparently made the Warburton volume available to Malone. If Greg had been right in saying that information about Warburton's play collection was first made public 44 years after his death by Reed from the Warburton list and memorandum alone, that information should scarcely be regarded as an accurate reflection of the views of Warburton's contemporaries and immediate successors. In fact, however, the first printed account of Warburton's collection (after the sale catalogue) appeared less than nineteen years after his death, and it was first published not by Reed, but by Malone, a highly respected scholar. Furthermore, besides the list and memorandum, Malone had studied the whole Warburton volume, as he shows by indicating that The Bugbears is "a free translation from some Italian drama" and printing an extract from The Second Maiden's Tragedy , together with a discussion of its authorship and sources. 36 Malone also had studied the Warburton sale catalogue and had purchased one Warburton manuscript, The Parliament of Love . Furthermore, in his publication of 1778 and its various reprints, Malone invited those who had information about manuscripts such as Warburton's to come forward, and it is likely that persons living in 1778 and 1782 could have disproved Warburton's claims if they had been basically false. Since it is hard to see how Warburton's list could have been a fabrication based on the Stationers' Register, its sources should be sought elsewhere. Malone and other early commentators agreed that Warburton had owned the 56 play manuscripts he claimed, and the grounds hitherto used to disprove that Warburton had those manuscripts will not bear inspection. Therefore, if Warburton's list contained nothing that could not plausibly derive from such manuscripts, it would be convenient to suspect that they were the basis of the list. In the cases of the plays not associated with Moseley, manuscripts may indeed have been Warburton's only sources; but in the cases of certain Moseley plays, it seems likely that Warburton had an additional source from which he derived information which is not found in existing play manuscripts that were certainly, or probably, in Warburton's hands. Greg correctly pointed to "2 d . p t . Maidens Trag." as a Warburton listing that can not derive from the manuscript, which refers three times to "The Second Maydens Tragedy," but never to a "second part." On the other hand, Warburton's listing of this play as by "Geo. Chapman" can not derive from Moseley's Register entry, which specifies no author. Since, however, the Register and Warburton both call the play a "second part" without known authority, their listings may have an unrecognized common source. Furthermore, since Moseley was the publisher of Beaumont and Fletcher, he would have had a commercial motive for representing his manuscript play as a sequel to their celebrated Maid's Tragedy . Other evidence that the Register and Warburton copied from a common source other than the play manuscripts is provided by Believe as you List , in the Register entry of which "a Comedy" has been deleted and replaced by "a Tragedy." 37 Warburton later retains the original error, which can not derive from the manuscript, which mentions "A new playe" and "A Tragedy," but not "a Comedy." 38 Presumably the deleted Register entry and Warburton's listing derive from a common, uncorrected source. Further evidence of a common source is provided by two other manuscripts. Both the Register and Warburton attribute The Governor to a mysterious "Sir Cornelius Formido;" but neither of the fragmentary names in the manuscript can be read as that of this otherwise unknown knight. Both the Register and Warburton attribute The Parliament of Love to William Rowley, but the manuscript bears no author's name, and the Master of the Revels licensed the play as a work of Massinger. The Register and Warburton likewise agree in including the word "Gallant" in the title of Alexius , where the Master of the Revels reads "Lover" instead; but Alexius is, on the other hand, one of the dozen significant cases in which Warburton omits spurious subtitles that Moseley inserted in the Register. It therefore may be that Warburton had a source for information known to Moseley but not included either in Moseley's play manuscripts or in his Register entries. This lost source may also have supplied Warburton other data about the Moseley plays that is not found in the Register, such as his designations of ten additional plays as comedies, tragicomedies, or tragedies; his attributions of The Second Maiden's Tragedy and The Noble Trial ; and his titles for Jocondo &amp; Astolfo and Love hath found out his Eyes . The Warburton manuscripts that had once been in Moseley's stock may have been accompanied by a descriptive list, prepared by Moseley or one of his successors, and ultimately derived from Moseley's office records. That Moseley prepared lists of plays in the course of his business is shown by his bulk entries in the Register and an extant bill of sale, covering 76 books, mostly plays, that he sold in 1640. 39 Since Moseley presumably planned to publish his plays, he probably tried to secure, along with each manuscript he bought, the information he would later need for a printed title page, including title, author, and type of play. A conflation of the corresponding entries of the Register and Warburton's list will provide these three bits of information for 30 Moseley plays out of 40, whereas the Register alone supplies them in only 21 cases, Warburton alone in only 22. This suggests that these 40 entries may derive from a source that supplied this information as far as Moseley had obtained it, and that the Register entries and Warburton's list contain variant and independent transcripts from such a source — both incomplete, but each including considerable information not found in the other. The seemingly haphazard order of the items in the two parts of Warburton's list may have followed the arrangement of his manuscripts on two shelves; a number of old lists of plays apparently made up in shelf order exist. 40 One item only on the first part of Warburton's list — "The Vestall A Tragedy by H. Glapthorn" — is clearly duplicated on the second part. Occasional duplications of this sort are characteristic of old play lists, both manuscript and printed, and it is, in any case, possible that Warburton had two manuscripts of The Vestal . Since the three plays referred to in Warburton's memorandum come from the second part of his list and are the only known survivors from that part of his list, Warburton, before writing his memorandum, may have checked only one of two parts of his play collection and found three survivors there. All the other separate plays that appear to have survived from Warburton's collection come from the first part of his list. Warburton's list supplies three kinds of information, in addition to the facts of his collection, that are not available from the Stationers' Register. First, Warburton lists sixteen plays not entered by Moseley, about half of which are not known from other sources. Second, Warburton supplies classifications of plays, attributions, and other details that Moseley did not enter in the Register. Third, Warburton omits intentional errors that appear in corresponding Register entries. Thus, although other sources leave little doubt that Moseley entered plays with spurious subtitles, Warburton's list establishes Moseley's guilt and points specifically to most of the spurious entries. By eliminating spurious double entries, Warburton helps to reveal the actual number of manuscripts by such a major dramatist as Massinger that Moseley registered. Warburton also supplies, augments, or repeats statements, many of which may be accurate, about lost plays attributed to Ford, Middleton, Tourneur, Shakespeare, Greene, Rowley, Dekker, Chapman, Marlowe, and lesser writers. The Harleian and Rawlinson collections, which were assembled about the same time as Warburton's, survive, but unfortunately their plays are mostly academic or unacted pieces of limited interest or, with the conspicuous exception of Sir Thomas More , manuscripts of published works by professional dramatists. The loss of most of Warburton's collection is serious because he apparently owned many unpublished plays by dramatists of note. In the case of Massinger, and probably in that of Ford, the loss is severe. It is unnecessary, however, to blame Warburton alone for the loss of these plays. If Moseley's successors had shown the same zeal for complete publication of the works of writers of note that he showed in his editions of Cartwright and Suckling, the loss might be less; but even their folios of Davenant (1673) and Beaumont and Fletcher (1679) were less complete than Moseley's holdings could have made them. Furthermore, very few plays have survived from the portion of Moseley's unpublished stock that Warburton did not claim to have obtained, or from the large collection of manuscript plays listed by Abraham Hill. 41 The unknown custodians of those manuscripts probably merit censure beyond any that Warburton deserves. In any case, initial publication of old plays was virtually unknown in the eighteenth century. The publication of Middleton's Witch in 1778 was justly regarded as an unparalleled event; and it was accomplished only at the private expense of Isaac Reed, and because of the Shakespearean interest of a piece that revealed a connection with Macbeth . Thus, a new examination of Warburton's list, memorandum, sale catalogue and surviving manuscripts suggests that Warburton's list and memorandum record plays that he owned and information that he believed to be correct. Therefore, skepticism about Warburton's motives and veracity might well give way to a further study of his statements and collection that could add considerably to existing knowledge of the finest period of English drama.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Notes on Early Editions of Fragmenta Aurea by L. A. Beaurline and Thomas Clayton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A few new facts about the printing of two early editions of Sir John Suckling's Fragmenta Aurea and the engraved portrait by William Marshall should be added to Greg's account in A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration ; namely, that there were not two but three states of the general title-page of the first edition (1646), and that the order of printing of the states was in fact the reverse of what Greg very reasonably supposed it to be; that there are two states of Marshall's engraved portrait, which is found in several of the early editions; and that Francis Kirkman was probably the pirate responsible for a surreptitious reprint of the third edition (1658), a complete copy of which is here recorded as such for the first time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. The Three States of the General Title-Page of the First Edition Greg distinguished two states of the general title-page of Fragmenta Aurea , 1646 (sig. πA2). Recording seventeen copies of the one he identified as (* 1 ) and eight copies of (τ 1 ), he not unreasonably suggested that "it is natural to assume that the less common variant (τ 1 ) was an attempt to improve on the original rather untidy setting" (* 1 ). But it is demonstrable that there were three states, as transcribed below, and that the direction of change was the opposite of the one Greg suggested. The three states, which we designate as (A), (B), and (C), the first corresponding with Greg's (τ 1 ), the second and third with his (* 1 ), are as follows, in the order of their printing: (A) FRAGMENTA AVREA. ∣ A Collection of all ∣ THE ∣ Incomparable Peeces, ∣ WRITTEN ∣ By Sir JOHN SVCKLING. ∣ And published by a Friend to perpetuate ∣ his memory . ∣ Printed by his owne Copies. ∣ LONDON , ∣ Printed for Humphrey Moſeley , and are to be ∣ ſold at his ſhop, at the Signe of the Prin-∣ces Armes in S t Pauls Churchyard. ∣ MDCXLVI. (B) Fragmenta Aurea. ∣ [&amp;c. as above] Churchyard ∣ MDCXLVI. [imperfect printing of "d" in "Churchyard"; without period after "d" and rule under date] (C) Fragmenta Aurea. ∣ [&amp;c. as above] Churchyard. ∣ MDCXLVI. Copies: (A) CLU-C 1 (1646), CSmH 2 (121942), CtY 4 (646), DLC, ICN, MiU, NN 1 (Jones), NNPM, Bodleian 1 (Don.e.15), Pforz 2 (996), TxU 3 (Hanley), ViU (B) CSmH 1 (110163), CtY 3 (646a cop. 3), B.M. 1-3 (Grenville, 1076.h.20, Ashley), Bodleian 2 (Vet.A.3.e.814), TxU 2 (Wh cop. 2), Clayton (C) CLU-C 2-3 (1646a cop. 1-2), CtY 1-2, 5 (646a cop. 1-2, Elizabethan Club), DFo, IU, MB, MH 1-3 (Widener, Houghton B, Houghton A), MWelC, NcU, NjP, NN 2-3 (Copley, Crampton), Osborn, Pforz 1 (995), TxU 1, 4 (Wh cop. 1, Ah) Greg regarded the direction of the change in the two states he distinguished as uncertain, and it is understandable why it seemed natural to him to suppose that "Fragmenta Aurea" (B-C and * 1 ) preceded "FRAGMENTA AVREA" (A and τ 1 ), since the first is indeed "rather untidy" and the second "less common." We can now be certain, however, that State (A) was the earliest, because it is approximately coincident with an error — eventually corrected in press — on sig. πA3 v , which is in the same forme of the preliminary half-sheet as the general title-page. In most copies with (A), "allowred" occurs on πA3 v ; whereas "allowed" occurs in all — 27 — copies we have examined that have the general title-page in States (B) and (C). It seems possible that the changes in the general title-page (A) that resulted in State (B) were made not during a later interruption but when the pressrun was interrupted to correct "allowred", since two of the four copies in State (A) that have "allowed" on πA3 v — TxU 3 and ViU — also have dubbed-in title-pages and are in that respect made-up copies (we are uncertain about Bodleian 1 and NN 1 ). At any rate, the coincidence of "allowed" with States (B-C) proves beyond doubt that they are later than an (A) that generally coincides with "allowred." Although indirectly, press-correction also explains the anomaly as well as the order of State (B), in which a period and the rule under the date are wanting. The imprint, in the same setting of type, appears in the special title-pages of The Goblins and Brennoralt , proving, as Greg noted, that the preliminaries as well as two of the three plays included in Fragmenta Aurea came from the same press — Susan Islip's, on the evidence of ornaments used. The special title-pages were printed, as part of their bibliographically independent sections of the book, apparently (as commonly) before the general preliminaries went through the press, since the condition of the same types is worse on the general title-page than it is on the special title-pages. The same rule under the date that was first used in the plays' title-pages appears in the imprints in States (A) and (C) of the general title-page but, anomalously and curiously, not in State (B). In fact, the rule does "appear" — almost invisibly — in State (B), but it did not print, owing to frisket bite. Of a number of copies in State (B) we examined, at least three (Clayton, CSmH 1 , and TxU 2 ) show grains of ink where the end of the rule should be, and the Huntington copy (CSmH 1 ), which is very crisp, also shows, under high magnification, a clear but uninked impression certainly made by the rule's pressing through the frisket into the paper. In this copy there is also a minute trace of the ink of the period that follows "Churchyard". 1 With the aid of this evidence, the printing history of the general title-page becomes clear. The larger capitals in "Fragmenta Aurea" (B-C), which replaced "FRAGMENTA AVREA" (A) with its smaller capitals, resulted in an increase of seven millimeters in the vertical dimension of the area to be inked for printing. Naturally the frisket should have been cut to the larger measure, but apparently it was not, at first, and the result was State (B). Some time after the press-run was resumed, it was interrupted a second time, and during this interruption two changes were made. At the same time the hole in the frisket was enlarged to allow the types suppressed in State (B) to print, as they do again in (C), approximately one-and-one-half to two millimeters of extra white space were inserted between lines five and six ("WRITTEN ∣ By Sir JOHN SVCKLING."). One cannot be certain which of the two changes, if not indeed both, prompted this second interruption, but that there were two changes of the kind described is apparent in the coincident facts that in State (C) period and rule are inked and the inked area of the overall title-page is still longer than it is in State (B), in which they are not inked. It is of some interest, though little can be certainly extrapolated from surviving copies, that, of the forty copies of the first edition of Fragmenta Aurea we examined, there are thirteen (32.5%) in State (A), eight (20%) in State (B), and nineteen (47.5%) in State (C). Greg was right about the less common of two "major" states, but of course wrong about the least common of three states. A reproduction of State (A) may be found in the Grolier Club's Catalogue of Original and Early Editions . . . of English Writers from Wither to Prior (1905), III, No. 104; of State (B) in the Grolier Catalogue, III, No. 104, and in The Ashley Library (1922-36), Vol. VI, facing page 19; and of State (C) in John Hayward's English Poetry (1950), item 84.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. The Two States of the Engraved Portrait by William Marshall William Marshall's engraving, used as a frontispiece in the first (1646), second (1648), and some copies of the third (1658) editions of Fragmenta Aurea , and also in some detached copies of The Last Remains of Sir John Suckling , 1659, shows Suckling turned to the right instead of to the left but in the same attitude and in general much as he appears in the great Van Dyck portrait now in the Frick Collection. 2 We have found two states of this engraving, the later of which shows clear evidence of re-incising, notably in heavy lines around the leaves of the garland (especially pronounced to the right of the face), a bulge in the left sleeve, a short black line to the right of the tie in the garland that was not present in the earlier state, and thicker base-lines in the streamer bearing the inscription "Obijt anno Ætatis suæ 28." From our examination of originals and photocopies, we have identified the state of the engraving in copies of Fragmenta Aurea , 1646, as indicated in the following list. Earlier state: Clayton, CLU-C 2-3 , CSmH 1 , ICN, MB, MH 1 , MWelC, NN 2 , NNPM, Bodleian 2 , Osborn, Pforz 1 , TxU 1-2 , B.M. 1 , 3. Later state: CLU-C 1 , CSmH 2 , CtY 2-5 , DFo, DLC, IU, MH 3 , MiU, NcU, NjP, NN 1 , 3, Pforz 2 , TxU 3-4 . The almost equal distribution of states between copies of the first edition — seventeen of the earlier, eighteen of the later — makes virtually certain that the plate was re-incised in the course of its printing, which in turn suggests a very large printing of the portrait and possibly, though not necessarily, an equally large printing of the edition for which the portrait was originally intended. A reproduction of the earlier state may be found in Greg's Bibliography , Vol. III, plate CXXXVII; The Ashley Library , Vol. VI, facing page 20; and Gosse and Garnett's Illustrated History of English Literature (1903), III, 25. The later state is reproduced in The Book Buyer , XIX (1900), 575.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. Francis Kirkman and the Surreptitious Reprint of the Third Edition (1661?) It seems probable that this reprint is the one W. C. Hazlitt first refers to in his edition of The Poems, Plays and Other Remains of Sir John Suckling (1874), I, lxx, as a reissue, perhaps a surreptitious one, with the same title, imprint and date [as Fragmenta Aurea , 1658], but with different typographical ornaments, and altogether a distinct setting-up. It is accompanied by a portrait, copied from Marshall's, and without any engraver's name. And perhaps in his Collections and Notes 1867-1876 published two years later (p. 411) he means to refer to the same reprint when he writes that The copy here used ends on K, and wants the Additionals named on the title-page. It has an anonymous portrait, very like Marshall's with Stanley's verses beneath it. This appears to be spurious, or at least a surreptitious impression. The copy in the British Museum wants the print. But one cannot be certain, because Hazlitt's comments are ambiguous. There is now no known "copy in the British Museum" of this surreptitious reprint, although there is a copy of the genuine Fragmenta Aurea , 1658 (shelf-mark 643.c.70), and one of the surreptitious reprint of (1672?) (shelf-mark 1471.aa.22), each of which "wants the print" — and there is a detached print of the copy of Marshall's engraving in the Department of Prints and Drawings. "This" may be the portrait, not the book, and "The copy" may be a genuine edition, not a surreptitious. Many a book saluted Hazlitt's hand. Greg recognized and described his "'1658'" as "a reprint, apparently, of the edition of 1658, the only known copy of which wants all before N1," and, as he went on to note of this fragment in the Bodleian Library (shelf-mark M.adds.37.f.12), "there is, indeed, little in the typography to distinguish it from the genuine edition" ( Bibliography , III, 1134). We have been able to identify as such a complete copy of this reprint in the Houghton Library (shelf-mark EC.Su185.646fc), and can therefore add some additional facts and inferences to the ones given by Greg. The complete copy is easily differeniated from the genuine edition of 1658 by the use of different ornaments throughout and, among other details, by substantive differences on the general title-page and in the catchwords of the preliminaries. Moseley's genuine edition reads, above the imprint, "Printed by his own Copies.", in which phrase the reprint reads "Copy.", and where the genuine edition has the catchwords "posthume" and "Stock," on sigg. A2 r and A2 v , respectively, the reprint has "nor" and "go", for example. Given in the form of Greg's Bibliography , a description of the general title-page and make-up of the reprint as it appears in the two known copies should be as follows: (1661?) [within double rules] FRAGMENTA AUREA : ∣ A ∣ COLLECTION ∣ OF ALL ∣ The Incomparable Peices, ∣ WRITTEN BY ∣ Sir JOHN SUCKLING . ∣ AND ∣ Publiſhed by a FRIEND to perpetuate ∣ his Memory ∣ The Third Edition, with fome ∣ New Additionals. ∣ Printed by his own Copy . ∣ LONDON , ∣ Printed for Humphrey Moseley at the Prince's Arms ∣ in St. Paul's Churchyard. 1658. Collation: 80, π1 A-X 8 [possibly but not probably leaving R3 S3 T4 unsigned: both known copies severely cropped], 169 leaves, paged (A5) 9-135 [misprinting 59 as 56 and 133 as 134, and omitting 80-89], (I3 v ) 8-64 [misprinting 45 as 54 and 50 as 51], (N1-S8 unpaged), (T1) 145-190 [misprinting 157 as 147]. Engraved portrait (a copy of Marshall's, omitting "W. Marshall fecit"), facing title-page. General title [&amp;c. as in 1658]. Besides having C3, D3, H3, R3, and (UV)3 unsigned, the genuine edition of 1658 contains a great many errors in pagination, especially on sigg. N1-S8, which are unpaged in the surreptitious reprint perhaps because of the multiple confusion in the original. On the evidence of ornaments, T. Johnson, the printer who performed similar unlawful offices for Francis Kirkman around 1661, would seem to have performed yet one more of such for the same pirate by surreptitiously printing this spurious edition — technically the fourth of the editions — of Fragmenta Aurea , 1658. The large ornament showing dogs licking a man's face (sig. S6) is found in Kirkman's piracies of Beaumont and Fletcher's The Elder Brother dated "1637" (Greg 515c) and Kirkman's The Wits : or Sport upon Sport printed for Henry Marsh, 1662. The ornamental "B" (sig. O5) recurs in the piracies of The Elder Brother and A King and No King , 1661. 3 Aside from its interest as a hitherto anonymous piracy that may now take a named place in the colorful and sometimes darkling history of printing, Fragmenta Aurea (1661?) gives further evidence of the strong seventeenth-century interest in Suckling's works that was renewed at the Restoration.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Defoe's An Essay Upon Projects : The Order of Issues by Joyce Deveau Kennedy</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An Essay upon Projects , if written in hopes of gaining the Court's favor or of, at least partially, reclaiming his wrecked fortunes, was singularly unsuccessful for Defoe. His projects for social insurance, bankruptcy reform, highway building, and so forth, apparently failed to fall even on deaf ears. In short, excellent though his ideas were, Defoe's book did not sell; and the original sheets, bearing canceled title pages, were reissued a number of times. The history of the various issues of the Essay's first edition is interesting as a chronicle of Defoe's downhill plunge in the years between 1697 and 1702, which saw the death of William III, the loss of Defoe's Tilbury brickworks, and his arrest for The Shortest Way ; and it is equally interesting from a bibliographical standpoint. For instance, seven variant title pages bearing three different dates, which comprise the first edition, have never been accurately catalogued. The last attempt to dispel the confusion surrounding the Essay's various issues was John R. Moore's in "Defoe's 'Essay upon Projects': An Unrecorded Issue," but Moore's explanation, as will be demonstrated, controverts several important facts. 1 The purpose of this paper is to establish the sequence and dating of these issues, whose title-page descriptions are listed below: AN ∣ ESSAY ∣ UPON ∣ Projects. ∣∣∣ LONDON : ∣ Printed by R.

(Boston Public Library, Defoe 21.E87.1702A) Two questions are involved — the original date of publication and the dates of the reissues. Both of these can be answered by investigating the history of Thomas Cockerill's business. Several different dates of original publications have been suggested by Defoe's biographers. One group has followed George Chalmers in dating the original publication January 1696/7; the other, William Lee, who claimed that the Essay , though dated 1697, was not published until 29 March 1698. 2 A check of available material, that is, contemporary newspapers and catalogues, fails to reveal the source of Lee's dating, and he nowhere indicates how he arrived at it. On the other hand, existing evidence in the London Gazette and Term Catalogues supports the January 1696/7 dating; and an analysis of Thomas Cockerill's shifts of establishment not only confirms the earlier date but also indicates in what sequence the issues appeared. An Essay upon Projects was first advertised in the London Gazette (#3256) for 25 January 1696/7 as follows: An Essay upon Projects. Printed for Thomas Cockerill at the Three Legs in the Poultry; and to be sold also by Mr. Hensman in Westminster Hall, and Mr. Goodwin in Fleet Street. It was advertised again in the Hilary Term Catalogue (III, 8) for 1697 as: 16. An Essay upon Projects: viz. of Banks, of Highways, of Friendly Societies, A Proposal for a Pension Office, of wagering, of Academies, of a Court Merchant, and of Seamen. Octavo. 17. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Both printed for T. Cockerill, at the corner of Warwick lane , in Paternoster row. These are the only notices until Trinity Term 1700, when the following entry appeared in the Term Catalogue (III, 200): 9. Several Essays relating to Academies, Banks, Bankrupts, Charity-Lotteries, Courts of Enquiries, Court Merchant, Friendly Societies, High-ways, Penjean-Office, Seamen, Wagering, etc.; now communicated to the World for publick Good. Octavo. Printed for T. Cockerill at the Three Leggs in the Poultrey . Price 3s. Clearly, the Essay was in press before Cockerill moved from the Poultry around February 1696/7. Furthermore, it seems safe to assume that the latter two advertisements reflect subsequent moves. The history of Cockerill's business in Plomer's Dictionary does not record the Warwick Lane address but merely notes that Cockerill began at the Atlas in Cornhill and then moved to the Three Legs in the Poultry, where he spent the best part of his life. 3 This brief summary can be supplemented by appeal to the Term Catalogues , in which Cockerill's first advertisement appears in Trinity Term 1674 (I, 176) at the sign of the Atlas in Cornhill. The last time this sign was used was Trinity Term 1677 (I, 283), for in the Hilary Term 1677/8 he was advertising "at the Three Leggs in the Poultry " (I, 304). Cockerill continued at this address for the next eighteen years; his final listing in the Term Catalogues for the "Three Leggs in the Poultrey" was Trinity Term 1696 (II, 584). Sometime between this date and Hilary Term 1696/7, when he appeared "at the corner of Warwick lane , Paternoster row " (III, 3), Cockerill moved his place of business. For the short time that Cockerill remained at the Warwick Lane address, H. Walwyn took over the Three Legs sign; but when Cockerill moved back to the Poultry — as he did, according to an advertisement in the London Gazette (#3492) 4 May 1699, which lists him as "Thomas Cockerill, who is removed from Amen-Corner to the Three Legs over-against Grocers-hall in the Poultry," and from entries in the Term Catalogues beginning with Easter Term 1699 (III, 123, 127 ff.) — he shared the Three Legs sign with Walwyn for a short time, and then probably to avoid confusion he changed it to "the Three Legs and Bible in the Poultry " (III, 148 ff.). From Michaelmas Term 1700 until his last entry in the Term Catalogues , Hilary Term 1702, he consistently advertised at this sign (III, 211-289). Cockerill's moves from the Poultry to Warwick Lane, and back, clearly provide grounds for determining the correct date of original publication, since both of the earliest title pages (according to address and sign listing in the Term Catalogues ) bear the 1697 date. Moreover, the Essay was twice advertised in 1697 — once in the Gazette 25 January 1696/7 and again in the Hilary Term Catalogue for 1696/7. Although books inserted in the latter were sometimes not actually published at the date of entry (I, xi), an advertisement in the Gazette for a book that could not be offered for sale until a year later would have been unusual, to say the least. This is the situation encountered if Lee's publication of 29 March 1698 is accepted. Another argument for discarding the later date is that both 1697 variant title pages are conjugate with preliminaries, 4 a stop-press alteration of the last three lines, which contain Cockerill's address, being the only discrepancy between the Three Legs title page and the Warwick Lane. Since the usual procedure was to print the title page and preliminaries after the entire book had been printed, and since Cockerill was advertising at his new address as early as February 1697, the sheets were undoubtedly ready for sale when the book was advertised in the 25 January 1696/7 Gazette . No evidence has come to light for dating publication in 1698 and much to indicate at least the strong probability that the Essay was published about January 1696/7, when it was first advertised. Unless evidence to the contrary is presented, Lee's dating must be rejected. One important fact emerging from this study is that the 1697 Warwick Lane title page can no longer be listed as if it alone were the Essay's first issue. 5 Both 1697 title pages being conjugates, they must be described as variant states of the first edition's first issue. The sequence of these two states cannot be conclusively determined, since no bibliographical evidence exists to indicate their chronology. However, whether Cockerill, anticipating his move, ordered the printer to run off a certain number of copies representing both his old and new address; or whether, deciding to move in the midst of the Essay 's printing, he ordered the printer to make a stoppress correction of address, it seems more than likely, in either case, that the Three Legs title page would have been first off the press, and hence represents the earliest state of the first issue. Although only one edition of An Essay upon Projects appeared in Defoe's lifetime, there were several subsequent issues of the original sheets with canceled title pages. Moore attempts to account for the 1697 title page bearing the " Three Legs in the Poultrey " address by suggesting that, when Cockerill moved from Warwick Lane to the Poultry in May 1699, "he substituted a new title page to indicate his change of address, but he retained the original title and even the original date of publication." 6 This explanation is clearly erroneous, since the Essay was first advertised at the Three Legs sign, and since, as was noted above, when Cockerill moved back to the Poultry in 1699, he advertised the Essay in the Term Catalogue (III, 200) under a new title and new date (the 1700 title page listed above). In 1702, the same year that Cockerill disappeared from the London publishing scene, the original sheets were again reissued, with four different title pages, two bearing the imprint of " Thomas Ballard , at the Rising Sun in Little Britain ," and two, the imprint "the Booksellers of London and Westminster ." Moore theorizes that the unsold sheets were disposed of to Ballard in 1702, and that "later in the same year Defoe reclaimed the unsold sheets and reissued them (with Ballard's title and date) as a private speculation." Moore refers to the fact that in 1703 Defoe issued his True Collection , which bore a similar statement: "London: Printed, and are to be sold by most Booksellers in London and Westminster." 7 Moore's theory may be valid, but it remains to be proved; several other possibilities exist. One is that Defoe reclaimed the sheets when Cockerill died — sometime early in 1702 — 8 and issued them with two slightly different title pages; but that when he was forced to hide from the Government in 1703 because of his Shortest Way , Ballard, a young bookseller hoping to capitalize on Defoe's notoriety, 9 purchased the sheets and revised the title pages to show his imprint. As early as January 1703, in The History of the Works of the Learned (London, 1703), V, 63 — an issue that also contained two pamphlets derogating The Shortest Way — Ballard was advertising " Daniel de Fooe's Essays on several subjects . . . ." under the list of "Books Publish'd this Month and not Abrig'd." Somehow, it seems more reasonable to assume that Defoe would have reclaimed the unsold sheets initially, but that finding himself in trouble, he would have disposed of them as quickly and as best he could. An examination of the four title pages reveals that all were printed from substantially the same type setting. The two Booksellers title pages, however, share certain characteristics (in rule enclosures and slight shifts of type line) which distinguish them from the two Ballard title pages. Furthermore, these slight discrepancies suggest that one set was printed, after an indeterminate time lapse, from the standing type of the other. The Ballard title pages are identical except for the partial resetting of line three, one reading "Subjects," the other, "Projects"; the Booksellers are identical but for the partial resetting of several lines of type. 10 The reading "bad Debs," which occurs in both variants of the 1702 Booksellers title pages, was quite possibly corrected to the "bad Debts" in Ballard's, if one supposes, as I have, that Ballard was the last to handle the sheets. As in so many of the episodes that involve Defoe, the story behind the issues of An Essay upon Projects may never be fully known. Hopefully, by establishing the sequence and dating of the issues of Defoe's first book, this paper will help illuminate one of the more shadowy figures in English literary history.</field>

Ball, "A Commentary on Daniel Defoe's An Essay upon Projects " (Unpub. Diss.

      <field name="heading_text">John Nichols on a Johnson Letter by James L. Battersby</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During the period when the Prefaces to the English poets were being written and published, Samuel Johnson had occasion to send many letters to his printer and friend, John Nichols. Among these letters, there is one which, according to R. W. Chapman, may have precipitated a "last-minute addition" to the "Life of Addison." The letter, without a date, reads: Mr. Johnson wishes that Mr. Nichol could favour him for one hour with the Drummer, and Steel's original preface. 1 Chapman's interesting speculation was provoked by the cryptic markings on the verso of the letter. In a long note to Johnson's letter, Chapman writes: 2 On the verso, in a hand not J's, which as I have not seen it I may presume to be N's, 3 is this note: "last sheet of Vol. 4 — Sheet Ii of Vol. 5 and last Sheet — last Sheet of Vol. 6." I think I can show the relevance of one of these entries to the text of the letter. The only reference to The Drummer in the index to Hill's edition of the Lives is at the end of the Life of Addison. "His humour . . . as Steele observes, is peculiar to himself." This is from Steele's dedication to The Drummer : "He was above all men in that talent we call humour." . . . Now in J's original Prefaces in ten volumes, 1779-81, the Life of Addison is in vol. V (1781). The quotation from Steele is not indeed in sheet Ii of this volume, nor is it in the last sheet. But it is in the last sheet of the Life of Addison, K6 recto p. 155. Perhaps then we may conclude that J made a last-minute addition at this point. Before discussing Chapman's note, it would perhaps be useful to review a few relevant details concerning the publication of the first edition of the Lives of the Poets , appearing originally in ten volumes as Prefaces to the poetry of fifty-two English writers. The Prefaces were published in two installments, the first, containing twenty-two lives in four volumes, coming out in 1779 and the second, containing thirty lives in six volumes, in 1781. The account of Addison was the first of three lives in volume five, i.e., the first volume of the second installment. The relatively short lives of Blackmore and Sheffield were included in the Addison volume. Finally, the "Life of Addison" in the first edition (1779-81) is collated as follows: A-B 8 C 8 (± C 8 ) D-K 8 L1. Without further inquiry, it would appear that Chapman's evidence has little to commend it and that he has too readily associated the content of the letter with the enigmatic markings on the reverse side, succumbing to the natural tendency to assume an integral relationship between two events enjoying the companionship of proximity. On the face of matters, the events would appear to be discrete and the relationship accidental. In the first place, it should be noted that Johnson asks for the original preface, which appeared in the 1715 edition of The Drummer , not for the "Dedication," which appeared as an epistle to Congreve prefatory to the 1722 edition of the play and from which Chapman quotes in his note. Secondly, if we disregard the letter for a moment and examine the puzzling note, we notice that it contains little to tempt us to look at the "Life of Addison," since, as Chapman says, neither "Sheet Ii of Vol. 5" nor the "last Sheet" of that volume has anything to do with Addison at all. There is, in fact, no signature Ii in the fifth volume of the Prefaces , and, if we assume that Nichols is referring to the Prefaces , the "last Sheet" would relate to the "Life of Sheffield." Thus, although the account of Addison is in volume five of the 1779-81 edition, the note has no immediate or ostensible relevance to "Addison." These initial problems notwithstanding, Chapman introduces additional difficulties in his own explanatory comments. For example, in spite of G. B. Hill's index, there are actually two references to The Drummer in Hill's edition of the "Life of Addison" ( Lives , 1905, ii. 79-158). The first reference appears on page 106 (in paragraph 75), and here Johnson is concerned chiefly with the appropriateness of including the play in the canon of Addison's writings, citing the omission of it from Thomas Tickell's edition of the Works (1721) and Steele's attribution of the work to Addison in the "Dedication" (1722): . . . it was not supposed that [Addison] had tried a comedy on the stage till Steele, after his death, declared him the author of The Drummer ; this, however, Steele did not know to be true by any direct testimony, for when Addison put the play into his hands he only told him it was the work of "a Gentleman in the Company"; 4 and when it was received, as is confessed, with cold disapprobation, he was probably less willing to claim it. Tickell omitted it in his collection; but the testimony of Steele and the total silence of any other claimant has determined the publick to assign it to Addison, and it is now printed with his other poetry. The second reference (the one to which Chapman directs us) is on page 148, where the title appears, not in Johnson's text, but in Hill's note (and only indirectly in Hill's note). When Johnson says that "His [i.e., Addison's] humour . . . as Steele observes, is peculiar to himself," Hill, locating what he assumes is Johnson's source, directs us to the following statement in Steele's "Dedication": "He was above all men in that talent we call humour." (Although the reference is to Steele's "Dedication" to The Drummer , Hill cites as his authority "Addison's Works , v. 151," by which he means The Works of Joseph Addison , ed. Henry G. Bohn, 1893, v. 151; nowhere on page 148 of Hill's edition do the words "Dedication" or The Drummer appear.) It is important to note that we have it only on Hill's authority that Johnson is referring to Steele's "Dedication." Furthermore, in addition to confusing matters by talking about Johnson's "quotation from Steele," Chapman tells us that the comment is in the "last sheet of the Life of Addison," which is, as we can determine from the collation above, simply not the case. The comment does occur on "K6 recto p. 155," as Chapman says, but "K" is only the last complete sheet of the life of Addison, the last gathering being, in fact, "L". The evidence advanced by Chapman clearly will not support the hypothesis that Nichol's note is related to Johnson's letter. Nevertheless, if we begin by trying to make sense of the letter itself, we may be able to establish its relevance to the passage on "K6 recto p. 155," at least its probable relevance. Initially, let us assume that Johnson did in fact want Nichols to send him Steele's original preface, not the "Dedication" to the second edition of The Drummer . The validity of this assumption is confirmed not only by Johnson's specific request in the letter, but also, I think, by the contents of one of his primary sources for the "Life of Addison," namely, the Biographia Britannica , which is conspicuously, though silently, present throughout the first and third sections of the account of Addison. On page thirty-seven of the 1747 edition of the Biographica and on page fifty-two of the 1778 edition, there is appended to the reference to The Drummer a long note, which consists of a paraphrase of Steele's original preface and an extended quotation from the "Dedication," including the statement "he was above all men in that talent called Humour." Since the original preface is presented only in a paraphrastic summary, Johnson might reasonably wish to examine directly the original, whereas he had no need to see the "Dedication" passage, since the clause that Hill assumes that Johnson was referring to in the "Life of Addison" and that Chapman uses in his note is reproduced in the Biographia . 5 Consequently, when in the account of Addison Johnson says that "His humour . . . as Steele observes, is peculiar to himself," he may have had in mind the following passage from the original preface, in which, speaking of the kind of humor in the play (although the word "humor" is not used), Steele writes: I own I was very highly pleased with it [i.e., The Drummer ], and liked it the better for the want of those studied repartees, which we, who have writ before him have thrown into our plays, to indulge and gain upon a false taste that has prevailed for many years in the British Theatre. 6 This passage corresponds at least more exactly to the meaning of Johnson's statement than the one which Hill cites, for, like Johnson's, it insists that Addison's humor was different in kind, not simply in degree, as the passage from the "Dedication" suggests. Johnson, of course, may have had neither of these passages immediately in mind, but if he were in fact alluding to the original preface, then it would seem that the letter to Nichols (the fulfilling of the request being assumed) culminated in a passage in the "Life of Addison." However, even if all the above were true, we have absolutely no basis for the assumption that Johnson made a "last-minute addition" to the account of Addison. The letter, we recall, is undated, but considered as a document isolated from a ruling hypothesis and on the basis of content alone, it would appear to belong to some period prior to the completion of the biography of Addison (perhaps to the summer of 1779, when we know that Johnson was collecting material on Addison and other poets, or to early 1780, when he was apparently writing the life), not to a later period. As far as Nichols's note, also undated, is concerned, it is highly probable that in the hurry of business Nichols jotted a note to himself on the most immediately available sheet of paper, a note relevant to a task at hand but totally unrelated to his work on Johnson's Prefaces , conceivably at a time long after the Prefaces had been published. The paucity of our knowledge must dictate modest claims. Thus, although we cannot be certain that Johnson introduced a remark in his account of Addison as a result of reading Steele's original preface, we do know that the relationship between Nichols's enigmatic markings and Johnson's letter is one of propinquity, not consanguinity; the relationship spatial, not causal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The Letters of Samuel Johnson , ed. R. W. Chapman (1952), III, 265. 2 Chapman's note first appeared in Notes and Queries (February 13, 1943), p. 103. My quotation is taken from the note as it appears in Chapman's admirable edition of Johnson's Letters (III, 265). 3 Since I have examined the letter, which is now in the possession of Professor F. W. Hilles of Yale University, I can confirm Chapman's assumption. The note is indeed in the hand of John Nichols. 4 Actually, Steele had written "a Gentleman then in the Room." The Drummer (1722), p. xvi. 5 Since Johnson frequently cites details and language from the "Dedication" that are not reprinted in the Biographia , it is clear that he had access to Steele's work while he was working on the account of Addison. Indeed, Johnson quotes, in a slightly revised form, the assertion that Addison "was above all men in that talent called Humour," earlier in the life; see paragraph 108 in Hill's edition of the Lives . The fact remains, however, that Johnson would have no need to see the "Dedication" in order to refer to Steele's comment on Addison's humor, and it is highly probable that Johnson's interest in the original preface was triggered by the notice of it in the Biographia , which, as stated earlier, is Johnson's steady companion throughout the concluding section of the "Life of Addison." 6 Joseph Addison, The Works (1893), V. 156.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Bibliographical Significance of a Publisher's Archive: The Macmillan Papers * by William E. Fredeman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the literary scholar publishers seem surprisingly cavalier about their records which have passed into the dead-file state. Firms not infrequently bestir themselves to produce a history, but once this is accomplished their concern is over and the archives are laid waste by dust, decay, and neglect — if, that is, they escape the ravages of destruction schedules. Busy publishing houses are not, of course, libraries, and most of them have neither the staff nor the time, and almost never the space, to maintain proper control over an ever-burgeoning mass of paper. Yet these very same neglected publishers' archives are fast becoming, together with the records of the periodicals of the period, almost the last major untapped reservoir of primary materials available to the scholar of nineteenth-century publishing. During the war, portions of the archives of several English publishers were dissipated into the smoke over the City. The book trade survived and the buildings were restored, but the lacunal bombsites of literary and publishing history can never be filled. That the disaster served, in part at least, to arouse a belated interest in publishers' archives is evinced both by the increasing use made of them by scholars since the war and by the institutionalizing of several major collections during this era of academic affluence. A number of recent studies have served to put the publisher of the nineteenth-century into perspective by examining the impact of widespread literacy and the rise of a mass reading public on all phases of the cultural and sociological current of the age: 1 But there is a notable paucity of systematic studies on the publishing of the period — there are even few printed listings of books published by individual firms 2 — and bibliographical knowledge in this area is still in its infancy. 3 If, as Simon Nowell-Smith says in his new book on Victorian copyright, "the legal, commercial and general aspects of bibliography deserve as much attention as the enumerative and analytical because of the assistance they can give to . . . the understanding of writers and their texts," 4 the cumulative value of the documentary materials to be found in publishers' archives is not simply historical. In fact, precisely because they contain such a wealth of information, especially correspondence, touching on all aspects of the book-making process — from submission and selection of manuscripts to marketing the finished product and payment of authors' fees and protection of mutual rights, publishers' archives are rich natural lodes for the bibliographical prospector, whether his interest be historical, enumerative, analytical, descriptive or critical. It is not really possible to be more than speculative about the specific textual significance of a collection of papers such as the British Museum's Macmillan archive, which has not yet been systematically catalogued. However, the research potential of the archive can be projected from a survey of the publishing history of the firm, with such aids as Charles Morgan's The House of Macmillan (1943), and from published studies that have utilized portions of the firm's archive. The Macmillan archive, though vast, is not quite virgin territory. Several groups of manuscripts from its reserves have been tapped by various scholars — notably those of Matthew Arnold, Lewis Carroll, the Rossettis, Thomas Hughes, Hugh Walpole, and Henry James. 5 The five volumes relating to the company all contain extracts from the archive, but although they provide some idea of the immensity of the collection and of its ultimate significance to scholarship, these "Macmillan books," 6 and indeed the formal research deriving thus far from the papers, have hardly made a dent in the available mass. The purpose of this paper is to describe the extent of the Macmillan archive and to relate the story of its recent dispersal, a complicated affair that provides its own object lesson for literary scholars and bibliographers alike.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I On 27 June 1965, The Sunday Telegraph carried an interview with Mr. Harold Macmillan, then chairman of the firm, announcing that the firm's archives would be sold piecemeal at auction in a sale "of a kind to warm the cockles of American bibliographical hearts" (Nowell-Smith, Copyright , p. 105). The interview mentioned that Mr. Simon Nowell-Smith had been commissioned to prepare the archives for sale at Sotheby's. Unhappy that so important a documentary record of nineteenth-century publishing should be broken up, Mr. Nowell-Smith sought unsuccessfully to persuade Macmillan's to give or sell the complete archive to the British Museum, and to persuade the Museum to approach Macmillan's. Failing this, he accepted the commission, and Mr. John Carter of Sotheby's, having previously made a rough list of materials in Macmillan's basement, provided the general directions that would determine the preparation of the archive for auction. Since the plan was to offer the material in the most attractive and lucrative lots possible, "Sotheby's advice was that major authors' letters should be segregated, and it was made clear that they were not interested in little known or unknown authors." 7 Material not destined for the sale should be destroyed, and Mr. Nowell-Smith was given authority to destroy "anything earlier than 1939" which in his opinion would be unsuitable either for the sale or for retention by the firm. The obvious reason behind the sale of the archive was Macmillan's abandonment of their premises in St. Martin's Street, which they had occupied since 1897, for more spacious and modern warehouse accommodation in the country, near Basingstoke. With an assistant, Mr. Nowell-Smith began to work his way through the more than half million letters in the archive. The material was roughly organized into 400-500 chronological boxfiles, "mostly falling to pieces," of letters arranged alphabetically from authors, agents, and the general public, to 1950 and beyond; the other side of this correspondence, consisting of some 130,000 copyletters in about 450 bound volumes, to 1939; some sixty copy-letter volumes and boxfiles containing letters to printers and binders, 1892-1923; readers' reports copied into forty-six notebooks, 1866-1912, 8 and sixteen bound volumes of autograph reports by individual readers and on related subjects; 9 twenty-two "editions books," between 1892-1930; twenty-seven volumes of "Records of Manuscripts" with indexes; nine volumes of "Agenda Books," 1931-1937, which record decisions whether or not to publish; a contributors' index to Macmillan's Magazine ; 10 some haphazardly accumulated proofs of books by Yeats, Kipling, Edith Sitwell, and other authors; a sizeable correspondence of Daniel and Alexander Macmillan with author-friends, mounted in albums; family correspondence and letters between the Macmillans on business matters; a vast quantity of letters, mainly nineteenth-century, between Macmillan's New York and Macmillan's London, with copies of replies, bound in volumes; 11 and, finally, a miscellaneous collection of legal and other documents concerning partnership agreements, building leases, action concerning violations of copyright, and the like. Since the object of the sorting, it will be remembered, was to segregate letters of authors of some renown into attractive lots for sale by auction, the task facing the sorters was overwhelming. However, as massive as the extant archive appears, it clearly is not a complete publishing record of the firm. As Mr. Nowell-Smith says in the Introduction to Letters to Macmillan , the correspondence files "began to be preserved, at first somewhat haphazardly, in the eighteen-fifties" (p. 11), so that many early records were not retained. Faced with endemic problems of storage, many publishers regularly destroy correspondence, business records, vouchers, and printing orders according to predetermined regulations and schedules in order to reduce the sheer bulk of accumulated papers, though some kinds of documents are classified "Not to be destroyed," or "Keep Always." Destruction schedules probably account for the absence of correspondence relating to Macmillan's Magazine and other periodicals which were published by the firm. Most prominent among missing papers in the archive are the letters by Tennyson and Lewis Carroll. A frequent contributor to Macmillan's Magazine , Tennyson did not publish books with Macmillan until 1884. By this date, most of his correspondence was conducted by his son, Hallam, from whom there are many letters in the files. Since we know that Alexander Macmillan was so staunch a Tennyson admirer that he thought originally to entitle Macmillan's Magazine , "The Round Table," and since there are in the archive "copies of many long and lively letters from the publisher to the poet laureate" (SN-S: Notes), a reciprocal side to this correspondence must at one time have existed. That the letters may have been destroyed piecemeal according to destruction schedules, previous to the packing up of the journal in 1907, is suggested by the fact that although letters to the Laureate appear in both the privately printed Letters of Alexander Macmillan (1908) and Graves's Life and Letters (1910), none from the poet are included in either volume. Another explanation has been suggested in the TLS review of Mr. Nowell-Smith's Letters to Macmillan , namely that the letters were lent to Hallam Tennyson for the preparation of his Memoir of his father and never returned. If so, they should be among the papers and manuscripts at the Tennyson Research Centre in Lincoln, but Professor Cecil Lang, one of the editors of Tennyson's letters, informs me that he is unaware of any surviving collection of letters to Macmillan. 12 Less mystification surrounds the Lewis Carroll letters, which were sold to the Rosenbach Foundation in 1957, the single instance known to me of such a transaction. Some letters had already been segregated for various scholars, but according to Mr. Nowell-Smith, the searching had been very unsystematic. For example, the late Professor Lona Mosk Packer was not shown all the Rossetti letters in the files, nor told that copies of the Macmillan letters to the Rossettis had survived. The condition of the files was such that direct access could not be given to scholars working on individual authors, and untrained searchers can easily miss treasures which the professional eye would spot. A singular instance recounted to me by Mr. Nowell-Smith was a Henry James letter filed alphabetically under "T"; the filing clerk had simply misread the signature and written "Turner" on the back. Through a more conservative interpretation of his mandate to segregate and destroy, Mr. Nowell-Smith managed to forestall the mutilation of the archive that would have been the inevitable result of following literally his original instructions. A large number of authors of lesser calibre was salvaged by grouping them together under such headings as "miscellaneous poets and novelists," "economists," "statesmen and soldiers," "musicians," etc., and these lots were eventually accepted as suitable for the Sotheby sale. Other letters were grouped under "copyright, net book agreement, The Times book war," and would, had the sale been conducted, have gone to Bodley (SN-S: Notes). Approaches were made to the directors of Macmillan's by Mr. D. T. Richnell, then the Librarian of Reading University, to present the residue of letters surviving after the sorting of major authors to the Reading University Library. "His feeling was," writes the Archivist of the Library, Mr. J. A. Edwards, "that even if all the literary items had been removed, the collection would still possess interest for students of publishing history, copyright and the book trade." 13 In November 1965, Mr. Nowell-Smith "obtained authority to hand over to Reading University 'residual material . . . on the basis that none of it (or any information derived from it) should be published in any form or sold or otherwise disposed of (except by destruction)' . . . without Macmillan's consent" (SN-S: Notes). The amount of material from the archive that was actually destroyed under the option exercised by Mr. Nowell-Smith was thus minimal, and in the main it consisted of certain runs of copyletters, such as those to travellers and agents, which existed in a dozen or more duplicates, and abstracts of publishing information that was more fully set out in other documents. By February 1966, the letters intended for the sale had been extracted and placed in author packets, and the residual collection, consisting of tens of thousands of letters, passed to Reading. The letters grouped for sale lots included the correspondence of about two thousand authors and others in addition to the groups of readers' reports, printers' and binders' correspondence, family papers, manuscript registers, and proofs, already detailed. At this state, presumably, the truncated archive was ready to be catalogued and described and assembled into lots for the projected sale. That some of the extracted material was ultimately deemed unsuitable for the sale is indicated by the fact that some 195 author packets were sent to Reading to join the residual collection early in 1967. 14 Before Sotheby's had started cataloguing the material for sale, however, and largely through the vision of John Carter — a member of Sotheby's but also a dedicated scholar and bibliographer — negotiations began in another direction (SN-S: Notes). In June 1966, Macmillan's offered to the British Museum their general copyletter file from c. 1855 to 1939, together with a few other items. In August, the Museum, which had thus far displayed little interest in the archive, declined the offer but indicated that it would be interested in the complete archive, which by this time, of course, no longer existed. Macmillan's replied that it was too late to reverse their decision to sell the collection at auction. Through the combined efforts of Macmillan's and Sotheby's, negotiations continued with the Museum, and in the fall of 1967 the extracted author packets and other archive material were sold to the Museum and "passed into the keeping of the Department of Manuscripts," which has now bound the collection into volumes and produced an index file of the more then two-thousand authors represented. Thus the story to date, with one exception. Save for the Lewis Carroll letters in the Rosenbach Foundation, certain marginal material which was destroyed, and documents and letters (mainly post 1939) retained by Macmillan's, the papers sorted at Basingstoke have now passed to the libraries of the University of Reading and the British Museum. This account does not, however, include a large cache of letters, originally a part of the archive, now in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library. Acquired in 1967, the vast bulk of the Berg collection consists of letters from Victorian theologians, though it also contains important literary names, including the Kingsleys, Thomas Hughes, Matthew Arnold, Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, Morris, Allingham, Patmore and Palgrave. Significantly, the letters in the Berg Macmillan collection were not among the letter-files entrusted to Mr. Nowell-Smith, though the Berg has the originals of a series of Thomas Hughes letters which exist only in typescript copies in the archives now in the British Museum. The provenance of these letters is not at this time available, but the narrowness of their range — most of them date between 1852-1863 — suggests that they may have been segregated for some purpose a good many years ago, perhaps for a project such as C. L. Graves' Life and Letters of Alexander Macmillan (1910). 15</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II In 1966, the correspondence files of the Macmillan Company of New York were presented to the New York Public Library. Had a similar, simple arrangement been followed in disposing of the vast archive of Macmillan &amp; Company of London, the story just recounted would be less interesting, but the convenience to scholarship would be infinitely greater than it now is. In the broadest and most charitable sense, scholars must be grateful that a correspondence file of such importance and magnitude has been made more generally accessible in public collections. We can take some consolation from the fact that a public sale, which would have dispersed the materials from Texas to Timbuctoo, was forestalled, but, clearly, the decisions taken regarding the London archive have in a very real sense violated a major collection of primary documents. Imagine for the moment the scholarly significance of so extensive an archive retained intact, properly housed, preserved, and catalogued, and fully indexed, calendared, and crossreferenced so that complete retrieval by subject, author, and chronology was instantly achievable. The collection could then have been used by the widest possible assortment of scholars in a dozen fields of pursuit. Dispersed to four libraries on two sides of the Atlantic, and stripped of its chronological sequence, the Macmillan archive can never again be consulted as a unified historical record. All too little has been said about the specific textual significance of the Macmillan papers. To the bibliographer, their special interest must inevitably reside in those documents which in any way touch upon the text of a given author. Even without a detailed examination of the uncatalogued archive, it is possible to anticipate material which would be bibliographically crucial in the reciprocal correspondence files which discuss matters of emendation and revision. Correspondence with printers confirming these points, cancel orders, invoices for type corrections charged to authors, surviving proof (especially corrected), printers' copies of manuscripts, stock reports, even binding details which might assist in establishing priorities — all are documents which might illuminate or elucidate the text by providing direct or indirect evidence to the bibliographer which reinforces the legal, commercial, and general aspects of bibliography that is the strength of the whole collection. The archives of Macmillan &amp; Company offer an interesting example of the care that must be maintained in preserving, cataloguing, and disposing of important manuscript documents. Through an unfortunate comedy of errors, for which no one was really responsible, the archive has been disengaged, dismembered, and dispersed, making it virtually impossible ever to reassemble it in its original state. The loss is both practical and historical, for the fragmentation of the collection violates the continuity that it once possessed. The handling of the Macmillan archive, in this age of relative bibliographical sophistication, provides its own moral that should serve as a warning to both scholars and publishers of the priority of claim which the preservation of primary documents must be given. To those scholarly explorers concerned with surveying the vast tracts of uncharted territories, the literary dark continents, of the nineteenth-century, Simon Nowell-Smith offers wise counsel in the conclusion of his new book on Victorian copyright (p. 105): "Move quickly": The intricacies of international law are fully documented even though bibliographers may not have fully studied the documents. But the documents vital to the historian of nineteenth-century publishing, such as survive, are fast being destroyed or dispersed. . . . It would be regrettable if other Victorian records of the kind were to be allowed to disappear or to disintegrate. Time for the bibliographer is running out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * This paper, now considerably shortened, was presented at the meeting of the Modern Language Association of America, 27 December 1968.

All except the second, which was privately printed, were published by Macmillan. 7 Much of the quoted material in this section is taken from notes provided me by Simon Nowell-Smith. Hereinafter cited as SN-S: Notes. 8 Several readers' reports which would be of extreme interest are not present, such as those for A Shropshire Lad , but these may, of course, never have existed. 9 There was no general series of reports between 1912-1930; those after 1930 were retained by Macmillan's. 10 This index has been used by the Rosenbergs for the Wellesley Index . No correspondence record for the magazine is extant. 11 Letters relating to the split between the two firms were retained by Macmillan's. 12 Two letters from Tennyson to George Grove and one to Alexander Macmillan (all dated 1868) appear in Nowell-Smith, Letters , pp. 111-116; those to Grove are from the Berg Collection, that to Macmillan (reproduced in facsimile) belongs to W. S. G. Macmillan. 13 Notes on the Reading Macmillan collection were kindly prepared for me by Mr. Edwards, Archivist in the University Library. 14 A list of author-packets was prepared in February 1966. The annotated list which was sent me by Mr. Edwards contains over one hundred authors not on the original list, including some important ones such as André Gide which were missed by the sorters. Unfortunately, there is as yet no index to the Reading collection. Mr. Edwards writes, "In order to trace letters from an individual author . . . the inquirer must consult the alphabetical sequence of files relating to the period in which the author is known to have been active. For an author whose writing life covers a very long period, the enquirer may have to examine several alphabetical sequences of files." 15 SN-S: Notes. Mr. Nowell-Smith feels that the survival of this cache may invalidate his assertion, quoted above, that the early correspondence files were preserved 'somewhat haphazardly.'</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Meaning of Copy-Text: A Further Note by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In "The Meaning of Copy-Text" ( SB , XXII, 311-318), Paul Baender traces the historical development of the term "copy-text" and argues that the word has now become "ambiguous and misleading." Bibliographers can readily concur with his view that one must be prepared "to redefine or abandon words that have lost general relevance and common meaning" without at the same time finding his dissatisfaction with this particular word convincing. As he has shown, its significance has shifted somewhat in the years since McKerrow invented it, as a result of changes in editorial thinking; but its essential meaning has not altered nor, it seems to me, has it become outmoded or irrelevant. Mr. Baender begins by commenting on "the two most common meanings of copy-text" — "basic text" and "printer's copy" — and says that they "are not necessarily incompatible meanings, and they may in effect mean the same thing" (p. 312). It is true that some writers have occasionally employed the word to mean "printer's copy," but the general use of the word by bibliographers for over half a century has been in the sense of "basic text." To speak of "the two most common meanings of copy-text," therefore, is somewhat misleading. If the meaning of a technical term is established through its use by a group of authorities in a particular field who have occasion to employ it, then "copy-text" has never meant anything but the text which an editor takes as the basis for his own text; and those who have used "copy-text" to mean "printer's copy" have used it erroneously. Whether or not more people outside the field are beginning to use the word erroneously is a separate question, and one that need not affect its use in technical contexts — just as the term "first edition" often means something quite different to the general public from what it means to the bibliographer. On the other hand, if the usage among bibliographers themselves begins to shift, one cannot simply dismiss the new usage as erroneous or the word as ambiguous; instead one must scrutinize the concepts involved in an effort to discover what conceptual changes may have produced the blurring of a previously useful distinction. When Mr. Baender asserts that "basic text" and "printer's copy" sometimes may "in effect mean the same thing," it is significant that he employs the phrase "in effect," for the two expressions refer to distinct and radically different concepts which cannot, without some sort of qualification, be said to "mean the same thing." "Copy-text" (which I shall use in the standard sense of "basic text") is an abstract term; "printer's copy" is concrete. "Copy-text" refers to that form of a literary text which an editor has decided, on whatever grounds, is the best one for him to follow as the basis for his edition; "printer's copy" refers to the unique document which a printer follows in setting type. "Copy-text" signifies an arrangement of words, abstracted from their physical embodiment; "printer's copy" signifies one particular physical document. 1 In those cases in which an editor makes no emendations in his copy-text, the printer's copy will consist of an unaltered transcription or photographic reproduction of one copy of the copy-text. The fact that the text embodied in the printer's copy can be identical with the copy-text should not lead one to conclude that the two terms can sometimes mean the same thing, since the two concepts remain as distinct as ever: the copy-text may exist in numerous embodiments (copies of an impression, transcriptions or reproductions of a manuscript), but only one embodiment of it is the printer's copy. If a bibliographer uses both terms to mean the same thing, he has necessarily altered the meaning of at least one of them, for the concepts themselves still exist unaltered. This sort of shift in meaning, therefore, is not the kind which emerges from an evolution in thought and fundamental changes in concepts; it is simply a change in terminology, which may or may not have resulted from a misunderstanding of the concepts distinguished by the original terms. It does not really make any difference, of course, what terms are finally attached to the concepts; the point is that the concepts remain, whatever they may be called. This line of reasoning suggests a few further comments on what Mr. Baender considers the two main reasons for the "ambiguity" of the term "copy-text." First is "the prestige that copy-text has acquired," which causes the word "to imply authority beyond its denotation, as though the term itself ratified an editor's choice of text" (p. 312). It is often the fate of widely accepted and respectable technical terms to be employed by uninformed persons as a substitute for thought; but it is difficult to see how this situation can be corrected by abandoning or altering those terms. The concept referred to by "copy-text" could be referred to by any term; but all terms would be subject to abuse by incompetent editors, and "copy-text" at least has the advantage of a tradition. To say that "the stature of copy-text in current usage makes the hypothetical edition sound as prestigious as the word is in our respect" is to suggest that a label can successfully hide the thought which lies behind it. But if an edition does not deserve the "prestige" conferred upon it by the designation "copy-text," the sloppiness of the argument defending it cannot stand for long, regardless of the terminology employed. Whether or not "copy-text" is a "banner-word" which "tends toward the superlative," it cannot be held responsible for the foolishness of some of the arguments in which it appears. The second, and more serious, reason adduced for the ambiguity of "copy-text" is that it is "not suited to the full range and complexity of editorial problems" (p. 312). Mr. Baender points out that McKerrow, when he originated the term, was "operating on a single-text or best-text assumption" (p. 314) and that Greg's more eclectic approach still maintained "with respect to accidentals . . . a single-text criterion." Such a view, however, oversimplifies Greg's position, for his statement that "the copy-text should govern (generally) in the matter of accidentals" was descriptive, not prescriptive. Whenever there is strong evidence, he was saying, for emending the copy-text — whether in substantives or in accidentals — that evidence should of course be followed; but when the evidence is inconclusive, one's chances of adopting what the author wrote — both in substantives and accidentals — are greatest by following the copy-text. 2 Greg's point, quite simply, was that one will normally have far less conclusive evidence with regard to accidentals than to substantives and will therefore follow the copy-text for accidentals more often than for substantives. Mr. Baender offers two illustrations of situations that he finds beyond the range of "copy-text." The first concerns several authoritative, and substantively variant, texts which derive independently from a lost original (p. 312). Since in his view the "eclectic" (i.e., critical) approach of Greg and Bowers "in the long run rules out the designation of a single text, basic text, or copy-text when there is more than one text of substantive authority" (p. 314), it would be "misleading," he feels, to label one of these texts as copy-text. Nevertheless, the editor must follow something, and what he follows is by definition his copy-text. There may well be instances of such divided authority that one text serves as copy-text for certain passages, another text (or several other texts) for other passages. But whether one regards this situation as involving two (or several) copy-texts, or one copy-text with emendations, is merely a statistical matter, a question of relative proportions. If "copy-text" is used to mean the text an editor follows except in those readings which he deems it necessary to emend, he cannot find himself without a copy-text — that is, if he produces his edition at all. To argue that the selection of one copy-text out of several authoritative substantive texts "misrepresents its stature vis-a-vis the others" does not make any allowance for the editor's statement explaining his position; even in simpler cases one cannot hope to understand the relationship among the texts merely by noting which one is copy-text, without turning to an editorial statement. The second situation cited by Mr. Baender is one in which a second printing of a plated book involves substantive revisions extensive enough to require the resetting of entire pages, and in the course of the resetting a number of accidentals are inadvertently altered. In such a case, "the modern editor," in order to "avoid the awkward procedure of inserting the authoritative second-edition [or second-printing] readings in a reproduction of the first" (p. 313), uses a photographic reproduction of a copy of the second as printer's copy and restores in it the accidentals of the first. The illustration is similar to an actual instance referred to later (p. 315), in which a periodical version is copy-text but the "first book setting" is used as the basis of printer's copy since it contains three hundred authoritative substantive variants. Such practice, we are told, represents "sound editorial procedure despite this convention of copy-text." It is difficult to understand, however, in what way the "convention of copy-text" is a hindrance here, for no theoretical question is involved — only the practical question of how most efficiently to prepare printer's copy. If, because of a large number of authoritative revisions, the easiest method of preparing printer's copy is to photograph a copy of some text other than the copy-text and mark it to conform to the copy-text wherever its variants are not judged authoritative, there can be no objection to the procedure on theoretical grounds: the copy-text is still the "basic text," and the mechanical details by which the printer's copy is made to reflect that copy-text are irrelevant. The only objections which could be raised would have to be on practical grounds; and, from a practical point of view, the procedure is indeed a dangerous one. A classic illustration is described in Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts's account of the history of the Billy Budd text: F. Barron Freeman, instead of making an independent transcription of the manuscript for his 1948 edition, used a copy of Raymond Weaver's 1928 edition which he had attempted to correct by comparison with the manuscript; the result was that Freeman overlooked more than three hundred of Weaver's errors and therefore incorporated them in his own edition. 3 The supposed practical advantages of working in certain cases from a text other than the copy-text may often prove to be illusory; the effort of making certain that the authoritative copy-text readings are reinstated may be more troublesome and risky than the inconveniences sometimes associated with using a reproduction of a copy of the copy-text in the first place. Although Greg's discussion of copy-text was limited to works which exist in more than one edition but in no manuscripts, there is no reason why his principles cannot be applied to any situation, regardless of the range of pre-publication forms which survive. It is quite true, as Mr. Baender says, that "the survival of pre-publication forms does not in all cases merely add another stage for a retrogressive pursuit of copy-text" (p. 316) — but surely Greg, if he had discussed the matter, would not have suggested that it does. The fact that a manuscript exists is obviously not sufficient justification in itself for choosing its text as copy-text; no two authors work in the same fashion, and the precise relationship of the manuscript to the earliest printed text must be ascertained in every case. Whenever there is persuasive evidence that an author worked in such a way as to make the earliest printed text closer to his hypothetical fair copy 4 than the extant manuscript is, the choice for copy-text would naturally be the printed text, not the manuscript. But when the evidence is inconclusive, one's best course of action is to select the earliest text as copy-text — for Greg's principle, to use the adjective which Mr. Baender aptly applies to it, is "prudential" in nature, instructing one how to proceed when there is otherwise no means for deciding. The greatness of Greg's theory of copy-text is precisely that it does apply to all situations. It is well, however, to keep in mind the distinction between "copy-text" as a descriptive term and as a theory of editing. As a term, "copy-text" simply means the text an editor chooses as the basis for his own text; Greg's theory sets forth a particular rationale for making that choice. So long as it is clearly understood that one is working within the framework of Greg's theory, it does no harm to use "copy-text" as a convenient shorthand for "copy-text according to Greg's rationale." If one is to speak of two current senses of "copy-text," this meaning — not "printer's copy" — can more properly be thought of as the second. All I am suggesting here is that, both as a term and as Greg's theory, "copy-text" has by no means outlived its usefulness. Though other words could be employed to make the crucial distinction between "copy-text" and "printer's copy," those terms are at once simple, suggestive, 5 and well-established; though other methods of selecting a copy-text could be devised, Greg's applies to all situations with impeccable logic. That an editor may use the word "to support doctrinaire procedures or to suggest a rationale he did not provide" (p. 318) casts no aspersions on the integrity of the word or the theory, but only of its user. Far from agreeing that the definition of "copy-text" as "basic text" is a "hindrance to precise editing," I should prefer to claim that any usage which blurs a basic conceptual distinction is a hindrance to precise thought and expression.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Compositors of the Cambridge Platform by John H. Dorenkamp</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An examination of A Platform of Church Discipline or, as it is better known, the Cambridge Platform reveals the hands of two compositors each of whom shared not only in the setting of the body of the text but also in the setting of the marginal notations accompanying it. The collational formula for this book, the first printed by Samuel Green after he had assumed the operation of the Cambridge Press following the death of Matthew Day in May 1649, is as follows: 4°, πA 6 A-D 4 , 22 leaves, pp. [2] π I 2-10, 1-29 30-32 ; $4(+πA5, 6) signed; πA4-5 missigned 'Aaa', 'Aaaa'; πA2-6 in italic. The title-page is πA1 (verso blank). A preface occupies πA2-6 v . The seventeen chapters of the text begin on A1 and end on D3. D3 v is blank. On D4 is a table of contents and a list of errata. D4 v is blank. The evidence for two compositors rests primarily on the presence or absence of three discernible characteristics: 1) the use of ~ to indicate the omission of an m or an n either within or at the end of a word; 2) the variant spelling of compound words containing there- ; and 3) the pointing of scriptural references printed in the margins. The appearance of these characteristics is shown on the following chart. It can be observed from the chart that the ~ appears at least once on all signatures with the following exceptions: πA6 v (which has only 14 lines of text); the entire A gathering; those signatures (B1 v , B2, B3 v , B4) which constitute the inner forme of the B gathering; and signature C1. The appearance of the ~ 169 times in the πA gathering, the outer forme of B, and in C and D, and its absence from the A gathering and the inner forme of B suggests a possible division of labor in the composing of the book. On the basis of this evidence, we may tentatively assign gathering A and the inner forme of B to one compositor, whom we shall designate as Compositor X, and the remainder of the book to a second compositor, Compositor Y. The occurrence of the variant spelling there- and ther - in compound words such as therefore , therein , thereupon , thereof , etc., provides further evidence for distinguishing two compositors. From the 87 occurrences of such words, it can be observed that in gathering A and the inner forme of B, tentatively attributed to Compositor X, there- occurs 14 times and ther - 9 times. In πA, the outer forme of B, and in C and D, tentatively attributed to Compositor Y, there- occurs 9 times and ther - 55 times. This distribution suggests a preference on the part of Compositor Y for ther - and further supports the division of labor suggested above. In addition, scriptural citations placed in the margin of the text appear to have been set by two different hands. In all, 433 such marginal references occur; 173 in gathering A and 260 in gatherings B, C, and D (Note: No such references occur in πA). In gathering A, pointing is generally absent (e.g., 2 Tim 3 16), but sometimes occurs at the end of a reference, especially when two or more references are listed successively (e.g., 1 Chron 15 13. Ex 20 4), and after the abbreviation of the biblical book (e.g., 1 Cor. 1 2). Occasional internal pointing is also found (e.g., Colos 2, 5). If we consider only this internal pointing, that is pointing within the individual reference, we find that in gathering A only 57 of the 173 references contain such pointing, and of these 57, 23 are pointed only after an abbreviation of the biblical book. On the other hand, of the 260 marginal references in gatherings B, C, and D only 6 contain no internal pointing; and in 2 of these 6 there is no pointing possible (Acts 17 and Ezra 7). The contrast between the pointing in gatherings B, C, and D and that in gathering A is evidence for two compositors, one of whom regularly points such notations and one who sometimes does but usually does not. Once again the division of labor seems clear — one compositor set the marginal references for gathering A, another for the remainder of the book. Further, it seems reasonable to attribute the marginal notations in A to Compositor Y, working on both inner and outer formes as Compositor X finished work on the body of the text and proceeded to set inner B; and the marginal notations in the rest of the gatherings to Compositor X who having completed the text of inner B proceeded to the notes on that same forme while Compositor Y began work on the body of the text of outer B. The only alternative seems to be that Compositor X set the entire gathering A, including the notes, and inner B excluding the notes, at which point Compositor Y took over, setting the notes for inner B and the rest of the book. This procedure seems too unwieldy and time consuming in light of the "widespread public interest [which] would have urged speedy publication." 1 In summary, then, we can attribute to Compositor X the text of gathering A and inner B and the marginal notations in gatherings B, C, and D; and to Compositor Y the text of gatherings πA, outer B, C, and D and the marginal notations in A.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">More on the Contributors to the American Quarterly Review (1827-1837) by Guy R. Woodall</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was with a great deal of pride that Robert Walsh, who edited simultaneously the Philadelphia National Gazette and Literary Register and the American Quarterly Review between 1827 and 1836, revealed in his newspaper the following distinguished writers who had contributed to his quarterly prior to 1835: Messrs. John Q. Adams, P. S. Duponceau, Albert Gallatin, Timothy Pitkin, William Rawle, Henry Wheaton, J. K. Paulding, George Ticknor, John Pickering, George Bancroft, Charles J. Ingersoll, T. I. Wharton, T. A. Budd, H.[enry S.] Tanner, G. W. Erving, J. R. Poinsett, Achille Murat, Wm. B. Reed, L.[orenzo] da Ponte, I.[saac] Lea, Jas. Bayard, William M. Meredith, G. W. Featherstonhaugh, [Jesse Burton] Harrison of New Orleans, Wm. B. Lawrence, T.[imothy] Walker of Cincinnati, the late Mr. [P. H.] Cruse of Baltimore, the late Senator Josiah Johnston, S.[amuel] Ward, the Eckhards [James R. and possibly his wife], David P. Brown, H. D. Gilpin, G. M. Wharton, Jules de Wallenstein, H.[enry] Brevoort of New York, F.[rancis] Markoe, Jr., Anthony Laussat, Robert Hare, Jr., Sidney G. Fisher, R. Walsh, R. M. Walsh, Major William Ware — Judges [Joseph] Hopkinson and James Hall — the Messrs. Alexanders [Archibald and James W.] of New Jersey, the Rev. Dr. [Frederick] Beasley, Rev. President [Francis] Wayland, the Rev. Dr. G.[regory T.] Bedell — Professors J.[ames] Renwick, A. McVickar, Robert Patterson, [Robert] Hare, William H. Keating, [George] Tucker of Virginia, [Charles] Follen of Cambridge, [Thomas R.] Dew of Virginia, [Charles] Caldwell of Lexington — Doctors [Robley] Dunglinson, [Thomas] James, [John D.] Godman, [Thomas] Cooper, [Francis] Leiber, J. K. Mitchell, [Charles D.] Meigs, [A. L.] Elwyn, [René] La Roche, [James] McHenry. 1 Because these contributors, as was customary at the time, did not sign their reviews and Walsh did not identify their contributions, their essays long remained anonymous. The first successful attempt to match a great many of the names of contributors with their articles was made by Sr. Mary Frederick Lochemes in her biography of Walsh in 1941. 2 Later, Professor Ralph M. Aderman revealed the names of many more contributors in his very useful "Contributors to the American Quarterly Review , 1827-1833," Studies in Bibliography , XIV (1961), 163-176. Despite Lochemes' and Aderman's extensive identifications, many authors were left in anonymity, and especially those who wrote for the journal after June, 1833. This was the date after which no other entries were made about the American Quarterly Review in the cost book of Carey &amp; Lea, the Philadelphia publishers. All of the authors which Aderman identified were based upon holographic entries in the cost book. As a bibliographical tool, Aderman's article has been augmented greatly by David Kaser's edition of The Cost Book of Carey &amp; Lea: 1825-1838 (Philadelphia, 1963), although Kaser made no attempt to identify specifically the names (mostly last names and often inconsistently spelled and illegibly written) of authors in the cost book. Since the publication of the works of Lochemes, Aderman, and Kaser, I have been able to assign the names of a good many more authors, heretofore anonymous, to their reviews in the American Quarterly Review . I have also been able to confirm some probable or supposed identifications made by Lochemes and Aderman and to give new meaning to certain names which appeared in Kaser's edition of the cost book. In a few cases I have been able to make some corrections of identities offered by Lochemes and Aderman. Much of the information which follows has been gleaned from Walsh's editorial column in the National Gazette and Literary Register , from edited and unedited letters, and from direct internal evidence in the articles themselves. The following list of contributors is offered as a brief but, it is hoped, useful postscript to the earlier inventories of Lochemes, Aderman, and Kaser: William B. Reed, "Mexico," II, no. 4 (December, 1827), 338-362. 3 Jules de Wallenstein, "Life of Bernadin de St. Pierre," II, no. 4 (December, 1827), 362-395. 4 Jules de Wallenstein, "Russian Mission to China," III, no. 5 (March, 1828), 255-286. 5 William B. Reed, "Ward's Mexico," IV, no. 7 (September, 1828), 85-115. 6 Charles Follen, "History," V, no. 9 (March, 1829), 85-99. 7 Major William Ware, Darby's View of the United States," V, no. 9 (March, 1829), 143-190. 8 George M. Wharton, "History of Pennsylvania," V, no. 10 (June, 1829), 408-437. 9 Jules de Wallenstein, "Spain," VI, no. 11 (September, 1829), 116-144. 10 Henry D.

Meredith, "Poor Laws," XIV, no. 27 (September, 1833), 66-101. 38 Samuel Ward, "Letters of Euler," XIV, no. 28 (December, 1833), 255-273. 39 Thomas I. Wharton, "The Life and Opinions of John Jay," XIV, no. 28 (December, 1833), 273-308. 40 Thomas I. Wharton, "Washington and his Writings," XV, no. 30 (June, 1834), 275-310. 41 John W. Williams, "Life and Policy of Canning," XVI, no. 31 (September, 1834), 1-41. 42 Thomas I.

For example, in Walsh's list of contributors, and obviously a partial list, which appears at the head of this article, the following writers have not been associated with their essays: David P. Brown, G. W. Featherstonhaugh, A. McVicker, and Joel R. Poinsett. The problem of associating these known contributors with their works is compounded by the fact that after the revelation of contributors and their articles in the Carey &amp; Lea cost book, which ended in 1833, and after the publication of contributors in Walsh's National Gazette and Literary Register in 1835, no other single list of reviewers was made. Since the American Quarterly Review continued until the end of 1837, the writers in the late years of the journal, mainly from 1834-1837, still remained largely unknown. Perhaps yet from some manuscript source or from some reliable newspaper contemporaneous with the American Quarterly Review will come the final word on contributors and authors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The National Gazette and Literary Register , January 28, 1835, p. 2, col. 2. This newspaper will be cited in the notes of this article as the NGLR , and citations from it will be from Robert Walsh's editorial column. 2 M. Frederick Lochemes, Robert Walsh : His Story (1941), pp. 138-150. 3 William B. Reed (1806-1876), Philadelphia lawyer, diplomat, and author, is identified as the author of this article in Roy Nichols, "William B. Reed," Dictionary of American Biography , ed. Dumas Malone (1935), VIII, 462. Aderman (p. 167) credited the article to John Read, and this is understandable because in Carey &amp; Lea's cost book only the last name was given and it was misspelled "Read." There are numerous cases of names being misspelled in the cost book as well as many cases of illegibility. Aderman (p. 167) notes that Lochemes (p. 164) assigned the article to Joel R. Poinsett. It was not Poinsett, however, but his kinsman Reed, who had spent some time with him in Mexico, who wrote the article. It is reasonable to assume that in the several cases in the cost book of Carey &amp; Lea where the name "Read" appears as a contributor it should be "Reed," not only because the name was misspelled in this instance, but because William B. Reed, never John Read, appeared as a contributor in Walsh's list in the NGLR , January 28, 1835, p. 2, col. 2. 4 Aderman (p. 167) interpreted this name as "Wallenski" and noted the identity as "unknown"; but David Kaser (p. 287) read it as "Wallenstein." In each place in Carey &amp; Lea's cost book where this name appears beside an article contributed to the American Quarterly Review , Aderman transcribed it as "Wallenski" and Kaser as "Wallenstein." I can offer no biographical data on the author, but Kaser is correct on the surname. It is Jules de Wallenstein's name, not a Wallenski's, which appears in Walsh's list of contributors in the NGLR , January 28, 1835, p. 2, col. 2. 5 Aderman (p. 169) gives the name as "Wallenski"; but for the same reason stated in note no. 4, the author should be Jules de Wallenstein. 6 The same source from Roy Nichols in the DAB in note no. 3 identifies William B. Reed as the contributor. 7 Aderman (p. 169) spells this contributor's name as "Tollin" and notes him as "unidentified"; Kaser (p. 289) questions the spelling but writes the name as "Tollin" also. That the name should be "Follen" instead of "Tollin" seems certain, because where Aderman (p. 174) assigned "Follen" (Charles) the article "Constant on Religion," XI, no. 21 (March, 1832), 103-120, Kaser (p. 295) assigned "Tollin." Thus, it would appear that the names recorded "Tollin" and "Follen" are one and the same. The case for "Follen" instead of "Tollin" seems even stronger when it is noticed that "Follen of Cambridge" is listed with Walsh's contributors in NGLR , January 28, 1835, p. 2, col. 2, but no "Tollin" is listed. 8 Aderman (p. 169) notes that Nathaniel A. Ware was probably the author. Major William Ware, however, is the only person named Ware to appear in Walsh's list of contributors which appeared in his NGLR , January 28, 1835, p. 2, col. 2. 9 Though Aderman (p. 169) says the author is not indicated in Carey &amp; Lea's cost book, Kaser (p. 290) clearly shows Wharton as the author of this, the seventh, article. That the Wharton is George — and not Thomas I., who was also a contributor to the American Quarterly Review — is certain; for Walsh identified George Wharton as the writer in the NGLR , April 7, 1829, p. 1, col. 1. George M. Wharton and John W. Williams (See notes nos. 42 and 45), later became co-editors of the American Quarterly Review . Though Aderman (p. 170) says that Robert Moylan Walsh, Robert Walsh's son became editor in 1836, this is not quite the case. Wharton and Williams became co-editors on January 1, 1836, succeeding Robert Walsh and his son, who had been the junior editor since January 1, 1835. NGLR , January 28, 1835, p. 2, col. 2; June 3, 1836, p. 2., col. 2. 10 Where Aderman (p. 170) assigned this article to "Wallenski," Kaser (p. 290) transcribed the same name as "Wallenstein." Jules de Wallenstein is the author; see note no. 4. 11 Aderman (p. 170) says that the author of this article is not indicated in the cost book of Carey &amp; Lea. However, according to Kaser (p. 290) the account book lists two articles to Henry D. Gilpin, one of thirty-three pages — this is Article II, and another of twenty-four pages — the latter cannot be other than Article X, the present article. 12 Hall identifies himself as the author of this essay in his "The Public Domain," XI, no. 22 (June, 1832), 265. 13 This article in the main is in the form of a travel letter. On page 456, at the beginning of the essay, Walsh, the editor, says he solicited it from George Washington Erving, Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain. Walsh listed Erving among his contributors in his list in the NGLR , January 28, 1835, p. 2, col. 2. 14 The author of this review wrote in a note on page 510 of an extended treatment that he had earlier made in Article IX, Vol. I of the American Quarterly Review . This earlier article was Walsh's "French Revolution," I, no. 1 (March, 1827), 189-222. 15 Aderman (p. 171) notes that William H. Keating is probably the author. William H. Keating is the author for certain, for he is the only writer by the name of Keating in Walsh's list of contributors in the NGLR , January 28, 1835, p. 2, col. 2. 16 William B. Reed identified himself as the author of this article by a direct reference made in his later essay "History of Cuba," X, no. 19 (September, 1831), 230-231; see notes nos. 3 and 6. 17 Aderman (p. 172) read and transcribed this author's name as "Candler"; Kaser interpreted the spelling as being nearer "Chandler." If Kaser's reading is correct, as I suspect is the case, the writer in all probability was Joseph Ripley Chandler, editor of the United States Gazette and frequent writer for Carey and Lea's Atlantic Souvenir ; see Kaser, pp. 279, 281, 282, 284. 18 Aderman (p. 172) notes that all reference to this review is omitted from Carey &amp; Lea's cost book, although Lochemes attributes the article to Albert Gallatin. Lochemes is correct. Kaser (p. 292) indicates that this article is in the cost book and that its author is Gallatin. Manuscript letters from Walsh to Gallatin in the New York Historical Society trace the development of the article: April 22, 1830; August 1, 1830; October 27, 1830; and February 13, 1831, Albert Gallatin Papers. The last letter indicates that Carey &amp; Lea, through Walsh, offered Gallatin an honoraire of five hundred dollars for the article. This was probably for the right to publish the article as a pamphlet, which eventually was done. The tenor of the February 13 letter was that Gallatin had been reluctant to accept payment for the article. In NGLR , October 1, 1833, p. 1, col. 2, Walsh named Gallatin as the author of the article and said that no profit accrued to either himself or the publisher from the article which had been published separately. 19 Walsh identifies Cruse as the author of this article in the NGLR , May 8, 1832, p. 1, col. 3. Peter Hoffman Cruse (1795-1832) was a well-known Baltimore author and editor. 20 Walker is identified as the author in a letter, Robert Walsh to Timothy Walker, June 26, 1832, Timothy Walker Papers, The Historical and Philosophical Society of Ohio. 21 Aderman (p. 173) and Kaser (p. 294) recorded the name of the author of this article as "Candler," but ,as explained in note no. 17, the name written "Candler" sometimes appeared more like "Chandler." I suspect that here and elsewhere in Carey &amp; Lea's account book that "Candler" is only a misspelling or illegible form of "Chandler." 22 Aderman (p. 173) says that this article was possibly written by Henry Reed. Undoubtedly the author is William B. Reed, Henry's brother, for he is the only person of the surname of Reed who is listed with Walsh's contributors in the NGLR , January 28, 1835, p. 2, col. 2. 23 Both Aderman (p. 173) and Kaser (p. 294) read the author's surname as "Candler," but I suspect that this is another misspelling of "Chandler" as was noticed in notes 17 and 22. 24 According to Aderman (p. 173) and Kaser (p. 234), this author's name is given in Carey &amp; Lea's cost book as "Read"; as in other cases in the cost book, this is, I believe, a misspelling of "Reed." See note no. 3. 25 Although Aderman (p. 174) notes that Reverdy Johnson is just as feasible an author as Josiah Johnston, who is said by Lochemes (p. 141) to be the writer, Lochemes has the better case. Walsh identified Senator Josiah Johnston as the contributor in a letter to Johnston, January 4, 1832, Johnston Papers, The Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Josiah Johnston, moreover, and not Reverdy Johnson, is listed among the contributors in the NGLR , January 28, 1835, p. 2, col. 2. 26 Aderman (p. 174) says that James Harman Ward is the probable contributor. However, Samuel Ward (1814-1884), author, financier, and lobbyist, is the author. "S. Ward" is the only person by the name of Ward who is listed with Walsh's contributors in the NGLR , January 28, 1835, p. 2, col. 2. That the Ward who wrote for the American Quarterly Review was Samuel is confirmed in Sidney Gunn, "Samuel Ward," DAB , XIX, 439-440, where Ward is said to be the author of articles on Locke and Euler in the December, 1832, and December, 1833, numbers of the American Quarterly Review . These articles respectively were "Locke," XII, no. 24 (December, 1832), 120-153; and "Letters of Euler," XIV, no. 28 (Dec., 1833), 255-273. Still more confirmation on Samuel Ward as the contributor on the Locke article is in Henry W. Longfellow, The Letters of Henry W. Longfellow , ed. Andrew Hielen (1966), I, 542, 544n. 27 Samuel Ward, not James Harman Ward as indicated by Aderman (p. 174), is the author of this article; see preceding note. 28 I assign this article to Joseph Ripley Chandler for the same reasons given in notes 17 and 23. I think that "Candler" as the name is read from the Carey &amp; Lea cost book by Aderman (p. 174) and Kaser (p. 296) is a misspelling of Chandler. 29 Aderman (p. 175) assigns this article to Robert Hare; Kaser (p. 196) interpreted the name as "Hall." Since Robert Hare, Jr., was listed as a contributor to the American Quarterly Review in Walsh's NGLR , January 28, 1835, p. 2, col. 2, and since no other article in the journal is assigned to him, it is possible that he could have written this article, or it could have been a joint endeavor. Collaboration on articles was not unusual. 30 Aderman (p. 175) notes that Richard Gilmore Simms is the probable author, saying that the author's name spelled "Simmes" in Carey &amp; Lea's cost book is perhaps a misspelling; Kaser (p. 296) translated the author's name as "Simons." Richard Gilmore Simms is positively identified as the author in a letter, December 6, 1846, William Gilmore Simms to Rufus Wilmot Griswold, in The Letters of William Gilmore Simms , ed., Mary C. Simms Oliphant, et al. (Columbia, S. C., 1953), II, 230. 31 Aderman (p. 175) interpreted this name as "Minot" and noted him as "unidentified"; Kaser (p. 296) likewise read this name as "Minot." It seems probable, however, that the name is "Murat." Achille Murat, but no Minot, is listed among Walsh's contributors in the NGLR , January 28, 1835, p. 2, col. 2. 32 Samuel Ward, not James Harman Ward as identified by Aderman (p. 174), is the author of this article; see note no. 26. 33 Aderman (p. 175) listed this name as "Harmon" and did not identify him; Kaser (p. 296) correctly saw the name as "Harrison." Jesse Burton Harrison is said to be the author of this article on slavery in "Jesse Burton Harrison," Appleton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography , rev. ed., ed. Rossiter Johnson, VIII, 499. This is the "Harrison of New Orleans" who is listed with the American Quarterly Review writers in the NGLR , January 28, 1835, p. 2, col. 2. 34 Aderman (p. 176) says that this article was probably written by Timothy Walker. He is correct. On p. 89 Timothy Walker identifies himself as the writer of an earlier statement on p. 29 of Vol. X of the American Quarterly Review . This statement was in Timothy Walker's "Criminal Jurisprudence of Ohio," X, no. 19 (September, 1831), 29-47; see note no. 20. 35 Aderman (p. 175) transcribed the name of this author as "Lampar" and marked him as "unidentified"; Kaser (p. 297) read the name as "Lamport" but was not sure of the spelling. It seems most likely, however, that the illigibly recorded name was "Laussat," because on an earlier occasion in Carey &amp; Lea's cost book where Kaser translated the author's name as "Lamport," Aderman read the name as "Laussat"; cf. Aderman (p. 170) and Kaser (p. 290) on Article no. 5, VI, no. 11 (September, 1829), 104-116. That the contribution in question is not from a writer by the name of "Lampar" or "Lamport" is certain since neither name appears in Walsh's list of contributors in the NGLR , January 28, 1835, p. 2, col. 2; Antony Laussat's name is listed. 36 Aderman (p. 176) and Kaser (p. 297) read this author's name as "Candler"; for the same reasons given in notes 17 and 22, I believe the author to be Chandler. 37 Aderman (p. 176) and Kaser (p. 297) read this author's name as "Candler"; for the same reasons given in notes 17 and 22. I believe the author to be Chandler. 38 Walsh identified William M. Meredith as the author of this article in the NGLR , October 1, 1833, p. 1, col. 1. 39 Samuel Ward is identified as the contributor in Sidney Gunn, "Samuel Ward," DAB , XIX, 439-440. 40 The writer referred on p. 285 of this article to certain matter that he had written on p. 468 of an article which had appeared in the June, 1832, American Quarterly Review ; this article was Thomas I. Wharton's "Life of Gouverneur Morris," XI, no. 22 (June, 1832), 449-472. 41 The author of this article wrote on p. 307 that he had related certain facts in the "Life and Opinions of John Jay," no. 28, in the December, 1833, number; this article, as seen in note no. 40, was written by Thomas I. Wharton. 42 John W. Williams is identified as the author of this article in the NGLR , March 21, 1836, p. 2, col. 1. 43 Thomas I. Wharton is the author. On p. 167 of the article he refers to a previous statement which he had made in his "The Life and Opinions of John Jay," XIV, no. 23 (December, 1833), 273-308; see note no 40. 44 On p. 212 of this review the writer says that he has written earlier articles on Egypt relating to the history, chronology, and architecture of that country. This identifies the author as James Renwick, who had written four articles previously in the American Quarterly Review on Egypt: "Egyptian Hieroglyphics," I, no. 2 (June, 1827), 438-458; "Egyptian Chronology," II, no. 4 (December, 1827), 509-533; "Egyptian History," IV, no. 7 (September, 1828), 27-53; and "Egyptian Architecture," V, no. 9 (March, 1829), 1-41. 45 John W. Williams is identified as the author in Walsh's NGLR , March 21, 1836, p. 2, col. 1. 46 Thomas I. Wharton can be identified as the author of this review by his statement on p. 74 that he is continuing with the plan of reviewing which he had adopted for the two previous volumes of Sparks' works on Washington. Wharton had begun reviewing Washington's Writings , which in this review he was finishing, in XV, no. 30 (June, 1834), 275-310; see note no. 40. 47 Identified in a letter, Willis Gaylord Clark to Fitzgreen Halleck, January [n.d.], 1836, in The Letters of Willis Gaylord Clark and Lewis Gaylord Clark , ed. Leslie Dunlap (1940), pp. 35-36. 48 Identified in a letter, Willis Gaylord Clark to Col. William L. Stone, [n.d.], in The Letters of Willis Gaylord Clark , p. 69. 49 Ibid . 49 Ibid .</field>
      <field name="heading_text">James Branch Cabell's Personal Library by Maurice Duke</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When James Branch Cabell died on May 5, 1958, in his native city, Richmond, Virginia, he left a personal library containing nearly thirty-five hundred volumes. This accumulation, the product of fifty-eight years of collecting, contains hundreds of autographed and inscribed first editions, heretofore unknown Cabell manuscript material, and letters and memorabilia from friends in the literary world, among whom were numerous major writers of the last eighty years. Unlike many writers, Cabell was conscious of books as objects, and he cared for them carefully. He kept his working library, books used as sources and references as well as books read for pleasure, separate from his own works and from complimentary copies sent him by friends. And he spent hours rechecking his holdings, reinscribing and reannotating countless items. Fortunately, his widow, Mrs. Margaret Freeman Cabell, has kept his library as he left it; hence the imprint of his organizing hand is still visible. I will describe the collection by using Cabell's categories: the working library; his collection of his own works; and finally presentation copies sent him, including the numerous letters inserted in them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The Working Library Since Cabell had two libraries and the first was destroyed by fire, the working library, numbering about fourteen hundred volumes, does not chronicle his reading during his entire lifetime. Cabell began collecting books as early as 1890, as an autograph in Kipling's Plain Tales indicates: "James Cabell (1890) / 217 S. Third / Richmond, Virginia." Cabell was eleven years old when he autographed this volume; eleven years later, on March 29th, 1901, his parents' home burned, destroying almost all of his early library. We know very little of the lost volumes except that some were by Poe, 1 and some were books that Cabell acquired between 1894 and 1898 while a student at the College of William and Mary. The first library also contained books he may have bought between 1899 and 1901, when he was a reporter on the New York Herald . In addition to the Poe we can be certain only that the early collection contained some books in the Mermaid Series, indicated by the following inscription in a copy of James Shirley by Edmund Gosse: "I sent this, remembering that your early / Mermaids were — wasn't it? — burned. The / holiday compliments — / L. G. 15-XII-24 / Paris —." 2 The working library is further inaccurate regarding what Cabell read because he often discarded books he could borrow from libraries. 3 Thus we see that Cabell's working library gives at best an incomplete picture of his reading. However, it more than compensates for this deficiency by the light it sheds on his published works. For much of his life Cabell was a genealogist. He began this exacting form of scholarship by compiling personal family genealogies, among which are Branchiana , Branch of Abingdon , and The Majors and Their Marriages . Thus he gained a reverence for precision, thorough note taking, and crediting of sources. As a result he inscribed many of his source books, hence leaving concrete evidence of the ways in which he transmuted sources into finished works of art. Cabell autographed or inscribed 409 of the 3,363 volumes in his library, many more than once. The inscriptions fall roughly into three categories. First are volumes in which Cabell simply placed his name, or the short phrase "Property of / James Branch Cabell"; second are the volumes, (often periodicals), containing factual information concerning his publishing history. The following are examples: The Bomb VMI. Published Annually by the Cadets of The Virginia Military Institute, 1901. Autograph: The first story and the first verses / to be published, regrettably, under / the name of / James Branch Cabell. The International : An Illustrated Monthly Magazine of Travel and Literature , April, 1901. Autograph: First published work. Rascoe, Burton and Groff Conklin, eds. The Smart Set Anthology . New York: Reynal &amp; Hitchcock, 1934. Autograph: James Branch Cabell / the first appearance of / Jurgen, in The Smart / Set for July 1918. Finally there are the inscriptions in the actual source books, volumes Cabell used in writing his own works. We find, for example, in W. W. Beach's The Indian Miscellany Albany, 1877, an inscription indicating the source for The First Gentleman of America : "It was this volume which, circa 1912, / gave me the notion of writing, some / day or another, the book which in 1939 / began to take form as The First Gentleman of America. / James Branch Cabell." Again, in Julia Wyatt Bullard's Jamestown Tributes and Toasts Lynchburg, Virginia, 1907, we find an inscription central to two Cabell books: "Property of / James Branch Cabell / — but for which he could not well have written either The Rivet in Grandfather's Neck or Let Me Lie." One particularly revealing inscription relates to Cabell's Jurgen . Controversy about the name of the main character, Jurgen, must end with a reading of an inscription in Hans Christian Andersen's Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales . Mrs. H. B. Paull, trans., London and New York, 1890: "An extensive source book, out of / which, among many other matters, / came the name Jurgen from a / short story I have never read. / James Branch Cabell." Also, in William J. Thoms's Early English Prose Romances , London and New York, no date, we find an inscription central to two more Cabell novels: "It was in this book that circa 1915 I / found the gist of Hamlet Had an Uncle. / Some of the Faustus story was utilized / in writing Jurgen. / James Branch Cabell." And finally in W. R. S. Ralston's Russian Fairy Tales : A Choice Collection , New York: Hurst and Co., n.d. we find the inscription "James Branch Cabell / his source book." The relevance of such inscriptions to Cabell the man and the writer is varied. That he simply placed his name in a given book tells us little. At most we can say he thought enough of the volume to sign it; and this is, of course, significant since hundreds of the volumes were not marked in any way. The information, however, takes on greater significance when we come to inscriptions which give us factual information concerning his career, for here is the raw material with which his biographer, yet unnamed, will be vitally concerned. Inscriptions in the source books are of obvious importance: they relate to Cabell's theories of composition, both in content and execution; and they often show, from germination to fruition, his progression of ideas. One section of the collection deserves separate mention. On the east wall of the library is a case containing 298 volumes. Here Cabell kept books on voodoo, folklore, sexual aberrations, and occult subjects. Also shelved here are dictionaries of mythology and anthropological studies, Sir James G. Frazer's works for example. The future Cabell scholar interested in sources and analogues will find this part of the library central to his study. Following are illustrations of these volumes.

      <field name="fulltext">II Cabell's Own Works With money received from the sale of an early story, Cabell purchased a large mahogany cabinet and stored there the numerous impressions, states and editions of his own works. Of the 236 volumes in this cabinet, eighty-eight have letters from his publishers, critics, and friends inserted in them. There are also numerous documents pertaining to Cabell's career in these books. Cabell inscribed almost every volume here, and some have directions to his future editors. Often the inscriptions are of a bibliographical nature, as, for example, in a copy of Branchiana : "Property of / James Branch Cabell / Only some 10 copies were / issued in this red binding."; and again, in a copy of Chivalry : "Property of / James Branch Cabell / this is the first state," and in Beyond Life : "First state, / normal binding. / James Branch Cabell." 4 There are numerous similar inscriptions. Although there are no full length manuscripts in the mahogany cabinet there is much manuscript material. In addition to notes jotted on scraps of paper and various kinds of minutiae, there are scores of typed manuscript sheets with holograph overlays inserted in the books. Sometimes the material relates to a section of a book which Cabell rewrote or to a preface or introduction. Especially is this the case regarding the Storisende Edition of his works. Occasionally the manuscript pertains to a purple passage, or other special effect Cabell was seeking. The manuscript for the "Author's Note" in the Storisende Edition of Jurgen , for example, indicates that Cabell changed his attitude toward this novel before it was republished in the collected edition of 1927-30. The manuscript is a typed fair-copy with a holograph overlay of corrections in black ink. Notice the changes that he made in his final revision: Original : As I recall it, the writer whom in some place or another I have seen identified as "the author of 'Jurgen'" aimed with this volume to introduce into the Biography the element of gallantry, as well as yet further to foreshadow the poet's fundamental attitude toward existence. Revised : Upon reflection I have decided not to write any new preface for "Jurgen." Otherwise, I would here explain that the writer whom, in some place or another, I have seen identified as "the author of 'Jurgen'" aimed with this volume to introduce into the Biography the element of gallantry, as well as yet further to foreshadow every poet's fundamental attitude toward existence. Original : Nor, for that matter, — I repeat, — do I feel any strong desire to say anything more as to this "Jurgen." . . . Revised : Moreover — I repeat, I am indissuadably set against writing any sort of preface for this "Jurgen." . . . Original : . . . "Don Quixote" and "Pride and Prejudice" and "Tom Jones", depends not upon what the author has put into its pages but upon what the reader gets out of them. And upon this understanding, I am willing enough to concede that the sixth chapter of the Biography may be the best. Revised : . . . "Don Quixote" and "Pride and Prejudice" and "Tom Jones", depends not upon what the author has put into its pages, but upon what one or another reader, for one or another reason, gets out of them. And I do not press the point that "Jurgen" seems to me not truly an individual book but just the sixth chapter of the Biography. These examples, and there are numerous others in this manuscript, are evidence that Cabell's attitude toward the Storisende Jurgen changed from the time that he wrote the "Author's Note" in fair-copy form until he finally revised it. In the fair-copy he indicates that Jurgen "may be the best" novel in the edition, while in the overlay he indicates it is "not truly an individual book but just the sixth chapter of the Biography." In the total Cabell canon such a point may be relatively minor; however, a study of sufficient similar examples will yield fruit for the scholar concerned with Cabell's revisions. The mahogany cabinet contains other similar manuscript material; the above is only an illustration. Apart from Cabell's methods of revision, the manuscript material gives us knowledge of his methods of composition. This is not the place to attempt a study of Cabell's prose style. It is enough to say that like Hawthorne, Henry James, Whitman, and a host of others, he worked very consciously for studied effects, and the steps by which he achieved them can often be seen in the manuscript material. In one volume we find manuscript sheets that prove Cabell scanned his prose as poetry in order to construct purple passages. It is necessary to quote at length from pages twenty-five and twenty-six of Special Delivery , New York: Robert M. McBride and Co., 1933 in order to illustrate this point: It does not seem logical that I have looked at every painting and sketch and water color in the Musée Moreau (including the three hundred little ones in the revolving stand), but have not yet seen Niagara Falls. To touch the skin of a peach sets my teeth on edge: so does the sight of a cut and wilted flower. I am stingy in small money matters. I dislike nobody, now that Woodrow Wilson is dead. In writing prose I observe that I do not naturally employ the Ionic a minore or the third paeon. I support twenty-eight goldfish, each of whom has his or her own name. I have never been cordially moved by philanthropy or altruism. When a dentist is working on my teeth I find it an immense comfort to wave both feet in the air. Such are the thoughts which occur to me when I think frankly about myself. Into the drift of new days I forbear to pry after dreams as large and ardent as those which swayed my far-away youth-time. Then I had grief, love, and laughter: now I am fairly contented. Life, which was tragic or blissful, becomes a more moderate commerce. All that is done seems well done with; all that I keep well contents me; all that awaits I must meet, God willing, without any whining. So much alone one may gain from the half of a century's schooling — platitudes flavored with gratitude. That is life's stinted tuition's end, in so far as I fathom it. Such are the thoughts which occur to me when I (who attempt this rarely) think frankly about myself. The latter paragraph, we see, takes on a poetic regularity absent in the former. The manuscript inserted in Special Delivery casts light on this, for here we find three versions of the paragraph. Cabell scanned the first two lines of the first version, arriving at a basically dactyllic hexameter line. The second version is slightly rewritten and it too is basically dactyllic hexameter. The final version, which appears the same as in the published form, has two overlays of revision, but it too retains the dactyllic hexameter line. Here we have concrete evidence that Cabell was an extremely meticulous prose stylist, and the importance of such evidence is of moment to the Cabell scholar. There are 225 sheets of manuscript inserted in the books — many indicating textual changes intended for future editions — as well as numerous pages of notes. Collectively they comment significantly on Cabell's attitudes toward his craft and on his methods of composition, and his plans for subsequent editions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Presentation Copies Of particular importance to scholars is Cabell's collection of some 750 presentation copies containing 577 heretofore unreported letters. They are from such people as Sinclair Lewis, H. L. Mencken, Ellen Glasgow, Stephen Vincent Benét, Hugh Walpole and George Jean Nathan, to mention but a few. Cabell treated his books as miniature filing cabinets, placing letters as well as other memorabilia in them. He began this practice early in life and continued it until his death. When he was young he carefully tipped in the letters, photographs, caricatures and so on. Often he would meticulously fasten the letter to the front pastedown endpaper and the envelope to the back, as he did for correspondence from F. Scott Fitzgerald. In later years, however, he simply laid the letters in. The following samples indicate the kinds of things one finds in Cabell's books.

Mencken, Hugh Walpole, Ellen Glasgow, Joseph Hergesheimer, Thomas Beer, and others. These inscriptions are of two types: first are the brief sentiments or appreciative comments followed by the signature of the sender. Volumes bearing such material are, of course, valuable to the collector of first editions, but to the scholar they have little or nothing to say. Much more important to the latter are books containing comments which reveal an author's attitude toward his works. A number of volumes in the library fall into this category.

Cabell's library, then, is of central importance to scholars of modern literature. His directions to future editors, inscriptions in source books, and the numerous manuscript sheets and letters as well as the books in his working library are essential to editing and understanding the man and his work. Also the presentation copies, containing hundreds of letters and inscriptions, comment in penetrating detail on a myriad of modern authors. His library preserves a large segment of material relevant to the complete study of modern literature.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">John Faulkner: An Annotated Check List of His Published Works and of His Papers by Helen White and Redding S. Sugg, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Wesley Thompson Falkner, III, who upon the publication of his novel Men Working in 1941 adopted the spelling of the family name made famous by his older brother William, published eight novels, a few stories and articles, and a volume of reminiscences. He left in addition, at his death in 1963, a considerable body of unpublished work. The first three of his published novels were widely reviewed; we have not listed reviews here since the significant ones are accessible in standard reference works. But the last five novels, representing his mature art, were published between 1951 and 1960 in paperbacks and scarcely noticed. To our knowledge, the only serious review of any of the series was an account of the first, Cabin Road , by Harry Serwer in The Freeman , XIII (March 24, 1952), 415. According to the publisher's estimates, total sales of these five books mounted, however, to between 2,000,000 and 2,500,000. Nevertheless, they are already rare. John Faulkner came to notice again with the posthumous publication in 1963 of My Brother Bill , the volume of reminiscences; but aside from this the only work by him now in print is his second novel to be published, Dollar Cotton , which first appeared in 1942. 1 John Faulkner's papers, including manuscripts of all the published works as well as the unpublished ones, have now been deposited by Mrs. Faulkner in the Mississippi Valley Collection of the John Willard Brister Library at Memphis State University. Our work with the papers, however, was carried out through the courtesy of Mrs. Faulkner while they were still kept in an old quilt chest at the Faulkner residence in Oxford, Mississippi. The value of John Faulkner's work for the student of literature must lie primarily in its own merits but also in its being a second and distinctive treatment of the Matter of Lafayette County. Beginning about 1938, he tried different approaches to the hill types of Beat Two, the northeastern part of the county. From the tragic, the macabre, the naturalistic, and the sentimental, he developed at length a pure humorous style in the last five novels. These, beginning with Cabin Road (1951), comprise a series in which the pervasive comic theme is the mutually uncomprehending relationship of the natives of Beat Two and the modern American State. We regret that the accidents of publication make it inconvenient to speak of Faulkner's fictional "Beat Six," to use the title of his first and as yet unpublished novel. A beat in a Mississippi county is one of five autonomous political units which brooks little "federal" power in either the county seat or the state capitol but has felt it from Washington, first in the Civil War and in Reconstruction and lately in the guise of welfare, conservation, and racial integration. Faulkner came to exploit this situation for the purposes of non-judgmental humor. It is a pity that "Beat Six" with its connotation of a fabulous dimension has not been available as a designation for the series of novels, which perforce is referred to somewhat confusingly as the "Cabin Road" series or as the "Beat Two" series. Faulkner's humor is in the tradition of the Old Southwest. We find that it meets every criterion of the genre as defined in recent scholarship and, more important, that it succeeds in the aim which has always been dominant in the genre — to raise a hearty laugh. As reviewers observed of Men Working , in which the humor is often macabre in contrast to the sheer good humor of the last novels, the humor is free of condescension and brutality, which have marked many of the earlier tales of the Old Southwest. Faulkner sets up a contest in human fecklessness between his natives, on the one hand, and townsmen and representatives of the Government, on the other, and keeps the hands even. John Faulkner's Beat Six — the Cabin Road world grounded in the actual Beat Two — will inevitably suggest comparison with William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha. John's creation is more limited in every way than William's, but within the limitations John achieved independent distinction. Even comparison with the humorous passages in William Faulkner, which have themselves been appreciated as superlative instances of the Old Southwest kind, or with William Faulkner's treatment of Cabin Road types such as the Snopes clan, shows, in our opinion, marked distinctions of style, tone, and purpose. Some of John's unpublished work, especially the novel "Beat Six" and a local history entitled "Mississippi Hill Country," provides background not only for John's published fiction but for some of William's as well. Students of bibliography will be particularly interested in John Faulkner's publication history. With the shift from hardback to paperback books which occurred with the publication of Cabin Road , his career was radically affected. No doubt the circumstance that William Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature at that time and certain other circumstances contributed to the eclipse of John's reputation, but the chief cause seems to have been the practice of not noticing paperbacks whose quality was disguised by garish covers and cheap prices. The appearance of John Faulkner's novels in an ephemeral, popular format is, however, one of the characteristics they have in common with their nineteenth-century predecessors in Old Southwest humor.</field>

A carbon copy accompanied by a carbon copy of a letter dated 4 November 1941 to Rich's Department Store, Atlanta. E. Manuscripts of Unpublished Books and Fragments (novels and nonfiction). 1. "Beat Six," pp. 1-325. A carbon copy, bearing in the upper left corner, p. 1, the legend, "John Faulkner / Oxford, Mississippi." The original typescript, which we have not examined, is at this writing in the hands of the literary agent, Scott Meredith. "Beat Six" is a serious novel of the murderous politics of Beat Two; written probably in 1939, it was John Faulkner's first novel. 2. "So Fades the Rose," pp. [1-41], an unpaginated fragment. Original typescript on yellow second sheets, apparently part of a novel concerning twin brothers, unlike but sympathetic, one of whom returns to a town like Oxford where he is haunted by his ancestors. Probably one of John Faulkner's earliest ventures in fiction. 3. "Uncle Tom's Tent," five fragments. The fragments are as follows: (a) "Uncle Tom's Tent," pp. 1-87 comprising the first eight chapters of a novel; original typescript on yellow second sheets with holograph revisions, including one additional sheet, numbered 46, which is a version of p. 60 of the fragment in question. (b) "Uncle Tom's Tent," pp. 1-4 of a version of Chapter 1 above; a carbon copy. (c) "Tent City," pp. 1-19 comprising a version of Chapters 1 and 2 above; a carbon copy. (d) an untitled fragment, pp. 13-29, comprising a version of part of Chapter 2 and all of Chapter 3 above; original typescript in red on yellow second sheets. (a) an untitled fragment, pp. 3-4, from a version of Chapter 1 above; original typescript on yellow second sheets. References to the published novels in the Beat Two series suggest that these fragments represent the beginning of a sixth which was to enlarge the scope by bringing the Beat Two characters into town, where the Federal Government seeks to aid dispossessed Negro tenant farmers from a large cotton plantation in the western part of the county, a very different world from the hills of Beat Two. 4. "Mississippi Hill Country," pp. 2-241. A carbon copy, the first 8 pp. mutilated, of a history of the hill country. An uneven work, this contains descriptive passages of great simplicity and charm which parallel the scenes which John Faulkner painted and explicit statements of his views as to the heritage and character of the hillman who is the grand subject of his fiction. 4 a. "Mississippi Hill Country," pp. 1-29. Original typescript, comprising a short Foreword and Chapters 1 and 2, apparently the beginning of a revision of the work. F. Manuscripts of Unpublished Articles 1. "Early Birds," pp. 1-3. A carbon copy of a sketch of William Faulkner as a boy in 1910 building an airplane. 2. "The Home Front."

      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of Calderon's Tercera Parte by D. W. Cruickshank *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This paper was originally a chapter in the introduction to a critical edition of Calderón de la Barca's play En la vida todo es verdad y todo mentira , but it became too long and too wide in its scope to fulfill its original role. It is in some respects a continuation of a study by Professor E. M. Wilson, "On the Tercera Parte of Calderón". 1 I shall therefore be brief in my introduction. The autograph manuscript of En la vida survives. The play was first printed in 1664, when it appeared as the first of the twelve plays in the first edition of Calderón's Tercera Parte ( Excelmo ). In this edition the play was, at best, printed from a very bad copy of the autograph manuscript, and the editor, a certain Vergara Salcedo, neglected his duties. Nine copies of the edition survive: I was able to collate the En la vida texts of eight of them on the British Museum's Hinman machine. 2 I also examined the apparently unique copy of Excelentissimo , the second edition, which also bears the date 1664. 3 The name of the printer of both editions is Domingo García Morrás. I shall refer to the play by the autograph manuscript title of En la vida , although all printed versions call it En esta vida . The format of the first edition is quarto in eights. There are thus four formes in each gathering. Until the order of printing is established, I shall refer to formes by gathering, sheet, and side of sheet, in that order (by "side of sheet" I mean inner or outer). Thus the outer forme of the inner sheet of the first gathering is A (i,o). Four formes can be printed in twenty-four different orders, i.e. factorial four. However, it is possible to tell by optical means whether the inner or outer formes were printed first. The first forme side of a sheet is composed of indentations where the type from the other side does not coincide with that of the first; where the type does coincide, the print of the first forme is raised and pushed out by that of the second. One must beware of irregularities in the paper. Many of these tell-tale indentations would be lost if a book was pressed. I suspect that this happened to the B.M. and E.M.W. copies, which were rebound last century. The U.L.C. copy, however, is still in the original limp vellum binding and the indentations have not disappeared. Some of these can be seen without artificial aids. For example, there are three printer's ornaments on 26 v , at the end of En la vida , the first play; 26 v is in the outer forme of the outer sheet. If one looks at the recto of the leaf, one can see protrusions caused by the ornaments coming through. These protrusions include the print on 26 r . Where 26 v is blank, e.g. between text and ornaments, 26 r has only indentations. Clearly 26 r , belonging to the inner forme, was printed first. Some identifications can be made with the naked eye, but others have to be made with a lens and a collimated light, which throws the embossed and indented portions into sharper relief. Examinations made in this way showed that over 94 per cent of the inner formes in the book were printed before the corresponding outers. 4 The outer sheets of gatherings I and LI had their outers printed first, as did the inner sheet of gathering X. I suspect that the outer sheet of Hh also had its outer printed first, although the evidence is not certain. I shall return to these exceptions: the main thing is that they do not affect the principle. The printing of the inner formes first cuts the possible orders to six. In an attempt to narrow the possibilities further, I examined individual pieces of type. Since the printers would normally be machining one forme while the compositors were preparing the following one, the same type cannot recur in consecutive formes, unless the compositors and pressmen interrupted their work to set up and print something else. This happened in the Shakespeare First Folio, as Prof. Hinman has shown. 5 In my search for distinctive pieces of type I used the Hinman collating machine. This had obvious advantages in that two copies could be examined simultaneously. The Tercera Parte is carelessly printed on poor quality paper, so that the same types often look different in different copies of the book: so it is essential to use at least two copies of the book when looking for distinctive types. En la vida occupies only the first 26 leaves of the Parte . I examined all of the first four gatherings, i.e. 32 leaves, which include part of the second play, El maestro de danzar . I found over 100 distinctive types recurring in these pages, but rejected over 40 because they were not sufficiently distinctive or because they occurred very rarely. By "distinctive types" I mean damaged ones, marked by being dropped and trodden on, or by having a hard object squeezed into them by the platen during printing. The type used to print the Parte was not new. Few pieces were seriously damaged when printing began, but many were nicked and cracked. Most of the capital 'Q's had lost part of their long tails. As I said above, there are six ways of printing a gathering in which the inner formes are done before the outers: four of these involve doing the two inner formes first [1: A(i,i), A(o,i), A(i,o), A(o,o); 2: A(i,i), A(o,i), A(o,o), A(i,o); 3: A(o,i), A(i,i), A(i,o), A(o,o); 4: A(o,i), A(i,i), A(o,o), A(i,o)]. There are two ways of printing the inner formes alternately with the outer formes [5: A(i,i), A(i,o), A(o,i), A(o,o); 6: A(o,i), A(o,o), A(i,i), A(i,o)]. I found ten damaged types appearing in formes A(i,i) and A(o,i), i.e., in both the inner formes. Thus the first four possible orders must be rejected (ignoring for the moment the possibility that work was interrupted). I also found that eight types occurred in formes A(o,o) and A(i,i), so that order number 6 should be rejected. I tested the remaining possibility in all 136 formes of the book, and on only one occasion found the same piece of type occurring in consecutive formes. This was in formes 60 and 61, and indicates an interruption or a temporary change in the order of printing. En la vida is not involved. When the book was printed, therefore, the inner sheet was perfected first, and in both sheets the inner forme was printed before the outer; i.e., the compositors began in the middle of the gathering and worked outwards. Obviously a good deal of casting off was necessary, since 3 v was the earliest page that could have been set up. The compositors had to cast off five pages in every gathering before they could begin it. This was not as hard as it sounds because they were dealing with lines of verse. The method of working out from the centre of a gathering was that used by the compositors of the First Folio. According to Prof. Hinman, one compositor could reasonably be expected to set 11,000 ens in a twelve-hour day. 6 Since one forme of the First Folio comprises about 10,600 ens, Hinman suggested that one compositor could comfortably set a forme of it in a day. However, the accounts of the working of the Cambridge University Press in the years 1696-1712 show that 10,600 was an exceptional figure: only one compositor attained it for any length of time. 7 Dr. McKenzie found that 6000 ens a day was a good average: see the table in Vol. I, p. 120. The most striking thing shown by this table is the great inconsistency in speeds of setting. Now one forme of the Tercera Parte contains 9000 ens. One compositor working at 6000 ens a day would take a day and a half to set this. On the other hand, there are very few problems of justification and the like in the Parte . The compositor might well have managed to set one forme a day. Lack of information about the printing-house of García Morrás prevents any further calculation here. McKenzie found that "it was unusual for a compositor to work for any long period on one book to the exclusion of all others — normally he would be setting type for two or three concurrently". 8 Unless we discover account-books for García Morrás's printing-house, guesses about the size of the Tercera Parte edition will remain guesses. However, we can discover something about the manner in which the Parte was printed, particularly about the number of compositors involved. Some evidence can be obtained from an examination of damaged types, and so I turned to these again. Since one compositor is essential, and there is no evidence for any more at present, I shall refer to "the compositor". The first forme to be set up was A(i,i), pages 3 v , 4 r , 5 v , 6 r , but not necessarily in that order; there is no way of discovering anything about page order from a forme taken in isolation. No doubt a single compositor would usually set up 3 v first and 6 r last (see below, however), but if two compositors were working simultaneously, 3 v and 4 r might have been set up first together . Obviously it would help if we could distinguish a 3 v and 4 r set up consecutively from a 3 v and 4 r set up simultaneously. The second forme to be set up was A(i,o), or pages 3 r , 4 v , 5 r , 6 v , which perfects the first sheet. A(i,o) was no doubt set up while A(i,i) was printing or waiting to be printed: the two formes certainly have no distinguishable types in common. The third forme was A(o,i), or pages 1 v , 2 r , 7 v , 8 r . As I said above, ten damaged types occurring in A(o,i) are also found in A(i,i). At this stage I began to divide formes into pages, to see if the recurring types always recurred in the same place in the forme. Pages are described as top left (tl), top right (tr), bottom left (bl) and bottom right (br). In these terms it is assumed that the forme is sitting with the signature in the bottom left-hand corner, that is, in the position for printing the signature at the bottom right-hand corner of the sheet. When I refer to pages, I do not here mean the impression on the sheet of paper but the metal type of the forme. The order of the formes having been established, I shall refer to them as 1, 2, 3, etc. In this way folio 1 v , which occupies the top left-hand quarter of forme 3, is referred to as 3 tl. Of these two symbols, the forme number 3 is the most important; the tl will, I hope, help the reader to visualize the position of the page in the forme. I shall usually refer to pages by their folio numbers as well. Forme 3 — A(o,i), 1 v , 2 r , 7 v , 8 r — contains one identifiable type from 1 tl (3 v ), four identifiable types from 1 bl (4 r ), one from 1 br (5 v ), and four from 1 tr (6 r ). These totals do not include running-heads. I have listed identifiable running-heads, but do not count them among the types. This is because they ought, in theory, to remain standing in the chase, or skeleton. When I refer to "recto-head", I mean the De Don Pedro Calderon de la Barca which appears on the recto of the folios. By "verso-head" I mean the titles of the individual plays, which appear on the verso. The list of types and running-heads is on pp. 245-247. Pages 7 v and 8 r have no identifiable types from forme 1, although these two pages have eight identifiable types between them, which appear in later formes. There is a simple explanation: 7 v and 8 r were set first. In the course of setting up formes 1 and 2, the compositor had cast off as far as, and including, 6 v . Thus he had to cast off only 7 r before he could set up 7 v and 8 r . Since he had probably turned to the equivalent of 6 v (the last page of forme 2) in his manuscript, I imagine he went straight on from there, and set 1 v and 2 r last. By the time he had done two pages, forme 1 was back from the press, and he used type from it to finish forme 3: the ten types from forme 1 all occur in 1 v and 2 r . There was nothing to be lost from this procedure, or to be gained. Verso-head III remained in the top left-hand page of the forme, and the two other identifiable running-heads also remained in their positions. The recto-heads of 6 r and 8 r cannot be identified positively, but no doubt the same one was used. This means that two chases were being employed at this stage of the work: if only one chase had been employed, we should expect to find the running-heads also used in forme 2. Thus the four pages of forme 3, two of them composed of type from forme 1, were put into the chase previously occupied by forme 1; while this was being done, forme 2, in a different chase, was being machined. All this is quite straightforward. We might have expected forme 4 (A[o,o], 1 r , 2 v , 7 r , 8 v ) to be made up of the types of forme 2: it is not. There are few distinctive types in forme 2, and those there are do not appear until forme 5. We could reasonably have expected to find left-overs from forme 1, which was distributed for only half of forme 3: these are all we find. None of forme 1's positively identifiable types occurs in folio 1 r , but I do not think any conclusions can be derived from this fact: this page is half occupied by the title of the play and the list of characters. In any case, I have noticed one type which may be the same: an 'n' with a nick at the top right-hand corner, which occurs in 1 r (col. 2, line 1, 3rd letter) and in 4 r (col. 2, line 24, 3rd letter). There may be others I have missed: type-watching is not an exact science. The absence in forme 4 of types from forme 2 suggests that forme 2 had not been distributed when 4 was set. This is confirmed by the running-heads. The chase and running-heads of forme 1 had been used for forme 3, of course, so that they were not available. Instead of using those of forme 2, however, the compositor made up three new running-heads (1 r does not need one) and so presumably used a third chase. Such running-heads in forme 2 as can be identified do not appear until forme 5. Thus forme 2 may have been in the press while forme 4 was being set up; otherwise the compositor would surely have taken its chase and running-heads, leaving the pages to be distributed at his convenience. Thus the compositor had set four formes and distributed one before the press had machined two. Had the press been fully manned, this would have produced an edition of several thousands, unless other matter was being machined or the Parte was being set by two or more men working simultaneously. Dr McKenzie points out that "if two compositors were working simultaneously on the same sheet, each setting one forme, they would have had to set from separate cases;" 9 Both the formes of the second sheet of the Parte (3 and 4) contain type from forme 1, therefore they were not set by different compositors, at least not in units of a forme. Forme 5 (B[i,i], 11 v , 12 r , 13 v , 14 r ) is set from formes 2 and 3, but only part of it from the latter. I do not think there is any significance in the scarcity of types from three of the pages of forme 2 (4 v , 5 r , 6 v ); two of the pages of forme 5 have only one column of type. There are ten identifiable types in forme 2, one of which is on 4 v and does not reappear until forme 8; it is 'q I', quite distinctive, and I have looked carefully and in vain for it in forme 5. Forme 8 is composed mainly of types from forme 5, and this jump from 2 to 8 is almost the only piece of evidence I have to suggest that more than one case of type was used. However, one type is not enough. The movement of the other types so far examined suggests that only one case was used. I saw no types from forme 2 in 14 r ; yet there are four from forme 3. The most likely explanation is that the compositor distributed forme 2 in order to set forme 5, of which he then did three pages. He became short of type and distributed 8 r and at least some of 1 v , from forme 3, in order to set 14 r , the highest-numbered page in forme 5. An examination of the make-up of forme 6 supports this. Forme 6 contains thirteen identifiable types from forme 3, and only one of these is from 8 r . In forme 5, then, the last page to be set up was the one with the highest number, that in the top right quarter of the forme. This is of little significance: what is important is that the page was almost certainly set up last on its own. Evidence from the first four formes is against simultaneous setting by formes. The evidence here shows that two compositors did not share a single forme by setting two pages simultaneously; if they had done so, using the same type, we would have found types from forme 3 in another of forme 5's pages. Thus if two compositors were working together, they were doing one column of a page each: even more inconvenient, since it would entail casting off by columns as well as by pages. A glance at the running-heads shows that the recto-heads kept their places, whereas the verso-heads changed round (br to tl, and tl to br). There is nothing unusual about forme 6 (B[i,o], 11 r , 12 v , 13 r , 14 v ), of which all the identifiable types come from forme 3. I tried to establish patterns in this forme, without success. 11 r , at the bottom left, has one distinguishable type from 2 r , also at the bottom left; 12 v , at the top left, has three types from its top-left counterpart, 1 v . But 11 r has one type from 8 r (top right) and one from 7 v (bottom right); 12 v has one from 7 v also, and so on with the other pages. I tried next to see if there was any consistency in the division of types between columns. 'ç' moved from column one on 1 v to the single column part of 12 v ; 'g I' moved from the same place to the first column of the dual-columned part of 12 v ; and although 'g III' also came from a first column, it entered the second column of 12 v . 'C' moved from a first column to a second, as did 'd III' and 'g II'. 'm II', 'q III' and 'v II' all remained in first or second columns. Of the three types in the only column of 11 r , one (N II) came from a first column, the others from a second column. Thus we have something of everything — and evidence that if two compositors (or more) were working, they did not trouble to keep their type separate, whether they worked by the page or by the column. This would have been an abnormal procedure. As for the running-heads, those from forme 3 were used, in the same position in the chase. I cannot say for sure that those of 8 r and 13 r are the same, but I do not see why they should not be so. There are more complications with the type of forme 7 (B[o,i], 9 v , 10 r , 15 v , 16 r ); it seems certain that the whole of forme 4 was distributed first, however. The compositor presumably ran out of certain kinds of letter after setting up the first two pages, and distributed half of forme 5 (11 v and 12 r ). Six types from these pages occur in forme 7, and none at all from the other two pages (13 v and 14 r ). In forme 8, on the other hand, there are no less than twelve types from 13 v and 14 r , and none from 11 v and 12 r . This seems to confirm the likelihood that only half of forme 5 was distributed for forme 7. The distribution of two pages in order to set two more might indicate two compositors working simultaneously, were it not that the types are scattered: at least one type from each source-page appears in the two pages set. And when the six types reach forme 10, they are again scattered without any pattern. The peculiarities of forme 7 involve the running-heads. The compositor could obviously choose between the chase and heads of forme 4 and the chase and heads of forme 5. He used two heads from the chase of forme 5 (13 v and 14 r to 9 v and 16 r ), but he certainly did not use the other two, for they were used in 9 r and 10 v of forme 8. Forme 4, it will be remembered, was the one for which the three new running-heads were made, and which was put in a new chase; obviously this chase could not be used as it was, for it lacked a running-head on the bottom left page (1 r ). The bottom left page in forme 7 is 10 r , but the recto-head from forme 5 does not fill this empty space. It appears instead in the top right corner (16 r ), where there already was a running-head. The running-head which was there (i.e. 7 r ) has no identifiable types in it, but it appears to have gone to the bottom left, i.e. to 10 r . As for the two verso-heads of forme 4, neither appears to have been used for the second verso-head of 7 (15 v ) — unless the one fom 8 v was re-set such that the 'v's of vida and verdad changed places. I am at a loss to explain this. Professor Bowers records a case of two running-heads vanishing when a change was made from one chase to two, 10 but this cannot explain the present problem. Forme 8 (B[o,o], 9 r , 10 v , 15 r , 16 v ) has types from four different formes, although its main source is forme 5. The case of 'q I' has already been mentioned. In page 15 r of this forme we have a similar example, 'N I'. Page 7 v (3 br) was not distributed to set up forme 5, but it was certainly used for forme 6. 'N I' missed this forme, which is not really unusual; it is a little more unusual that it should have missed forme 7 as well. However, 'N I' cannot be said to suggest that more than one case was being used, as might have been implied had it not re-appeared until forme 9. The 'v I' and 'u I' which were previously used in forme 4 are almost certainly left-overs from the distribution made for forme 7. Their appearance in forme 8 instead of in 10 suggests that there was only one case of type. The lack of types from 11 v and 12 r (5 tl and bl) suggests that these two pages had already been distributed and used, as I said above. The running-heads of forme 8 follow the now established pattern: two from forme 5, two from forme 6, although I cannot identify positively the running-heads of 13 r and 15 r . However, the p of Pedro appears to have a small defect where the bottom of the loop joins the stem. Probably the chase previously containing forme 5 was used, since the running-heads from 5 do not change their positions. Those from 6 do. The whole procedure seems very inefficient. There appears to be nothing unusual about forme 9 (C[i,i], 19 v , 20 r , 21 v , 22 r ). A left-over 'n' from forme 5 provides still more evidence for the use of only one case of type. 'n' could not have arrived at forme 9 via forme 7, for the page it occupied in forme 5 (14 r ) was not distributed for 7. The movement of the other types does not seem to require comment. The two running-heads from the chase of forme 6 have been reversed: perhaps the chase was turned round. This time it appears that only one running-head was taken from forme 7: verso-head IV. The recto-head on 16 r found its way into forme 10, and in those of 10 r (7) and 21 r (10) the l of la prints badly, so that they are probably the same. Where the recto-head of 20 r comes from I do not know. The make-up of forme 10 (C[i,o], 19 r , 20 v , 21 r , 22 v ) is apparently quite straightforward: the forme contains twenty types from forme 7. There are fewest from 9 v and 10 r , no doubt because all of 10 r and most of 9 v have only one column of type. Most of forme 10 goes to make up forme 13, but two of the types, 'd II' and 'Q I', find their way into formes 14 and 15 respectively; the latter is definitely not in forme 12. Thus the case which was used to set 10 was also used for 13, 14 and 15. The strange movement of the running-heads goes on, with the origins of those of 21 r and 22 v obscure. Perhaps, as I suggested above, 21 r comes from 10 r (forme 7). That on 22 v has an inverted m , a sign that it was a fresh composition, or proof that it was at some time out of its chase. I think it may be the one previously found in forme 7 (15 v ). Fortunately nothing important depends on this information. The first column of 20 v was corrected; in line 31 the B.N.P. copy and one of the Vatican copies (V.K.) give "Focas viua." The last word is an adjective, and all the other copies examined give viuo . The other pages of the forme have no corrections. One wonders, in view of the many variants from the autograph manuscript in these pages, if the corrector looked at them; if he did, and passed them, his version of the text was very corrupt. Folio 19 r , for example, has nearly thirty variants from the autograph manuscript, at least two of which could have been corrected without an original: the abbreviation Ssb. for Sabañón in column 1, line 21; and the stage direction Vase. , twice attributed to Astolfo (col. 1, lines 32 and 37) when it should have been attributed once each to him and to Lisipo. Errors such as these suggest that not all four pages of the forme were corrected, or at least that they were corrected very carelessly. Forme 11 (C[o,i], 17 v , 18 r , 23 v , 24 r ) was also corrected, but this time the uncorrected version is found in B.N.P. and E.M.W. Formes 10 and 11 are on separate sheets, i.e. forme 11 does not perfect 10. Thus the fact that E.M.W. and V.K. have only one of the two uncorrected formes indicates that the sheets were probably not bound in the order in which they were machined: i.e., that the tenth book (say) to be bound was not composed of the tenth impression of every sheet. (This assumes that when forme 9 was printed, the pile of sheets was turned, so that they were perfected in the order in which they were first impressed: this would be normal). A forme was probably corrected early, while few copies had been printed from it, but formes would probably not always be corrected at the same stage, e.g., after ten copies had been printed. If, say, there were only ten uncorrected copies of forme 10 and fifteen of forme 11, and the sheets were bound in the order in which they were printed, there would be five volumes containing only the uncorrected forme 11, but ten containing both uncorrected formes. This did not happen: so no one book will contain all uncorrected formes. This probably means that other tell-tale uncorrected formes were scattered through long-since lost copies of the Tercera Parte . If, on the other hand, Vergara Salcedo decided to fulfill some of his obligations as editor, and paid occasional visits to the press to supervise correcting, many incorrect copies of a forme might have been printed, and corrected formes might be few and far between. Only three pages (17 v , 18 r , 24 r ) of forme 11 were altered in the correcting; there was one change in 17 v , five changes in 18 r and one in 24 r , a total of eight for the two formes. In 23 v the verso-head was moved an eighth of an inch — to the left in the forme, to the right in the printed sheet; this was probably done accidentally when the wedges were removed for correction. Once again, to judge from the number of errors remaining, the corrector's copy was very corrupt; yet correction was done from a copy, for one of the corrections could not otherwise have been made. This is the changing of decidido to dicidido (fol. 18 r , 1, 25). Calderón wrote dicidido , but decidido was an equally correct and possibly more common form in the mid-seventeenth century. The verso-head from 8 tl (10 v ) was used in forme 10. No doubt this was why the compositor used the verso-head from 9 tl (19 v ) in forme 11. He was still going back three formes to get the bulk of the type for the one he was setting, but the press was not falling behind, for it was completing the machining of the forme two earlier than the one he was working on. Forme 12 (C[o,o], 17 r , 18 v , 23 r , 24 v ) appears to be composed of forme 9, some residue from 8, and at least one running-head from 10: where the others come from I do not know. No types from the top two pages of forme 9 (19 v and 22 r ) were observed in the two lowest-numbered pages of 12. This could mean that the bottom pages were distributed first and that the top pages were not distributed until two pages of the new forme had been set. I am a little troubled by 'N III', which went from 19 r (10 bl) to 23 r . Most of the type from 19 r seems to appear in forme 13. However, 'N III' occurs at the end of page 23 r (column 2, line 29); the compositor may have been running short of 'N's, and may have taken it from forme 10 without actually distributing any type. The same has happened in forme 13 (D[i,i], 27 v , 28 r , 29 v , 30 r ) as in forme 5: in his first three pages the compositor used seventeen identifiable types from forme 10, quite evenly scattered (7, 4, 6), and in his fourth page only one. The fourth page also has two types (O II, ſt I) from a page of a new forme, forme 11: clearly it was set last, on its own, after the other three. Simultaneous composition of two pages is ruled out. Indeed, since both of forme 11's types occur in the second column of 30 r , the evidence is against simultaneous composition of two columns. I do not know what movement took place among the running-heads, but old ones were being distributed and new ones set up. Thus some of the identifiable ones disappear and the new ones cannot be traced. There are not many recognizable types in forme 14 (D[i,o], 27 r , 28 v , 29 r , 30 v ), so that reliable information cannot be obtained. The shortage of types in 14 from pages 17 v and 24 r of forme 11 may indicate that part of these pages was used for forme 13: at least some of the former must have been used. The left-over 'd' from forme 10 has already been mentioned. Little comment on the last two formes is necessary; 15 (D[o,i], 25 v , 26 r , 31 v , 32 r ) does not appear to use any types from 13, nor 16 (D[o,o], 25 r , 26 v , 31 r , 32 v ) any from 14. The identifiable running-heads used in the earlier formes have now almost completely vanished, although I have traced recto-head I from 15 to 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 28. Running-heads are a problem in themselves, and the problem is probably aggravated in En la vida by re-setting after accidental breaking-up. There is no doubt, however, that the whole book was printed with the same fount of type. Many of the distinctive types occur all the way through and even in the preliminaries. The heading FAMOSA COMEDIA is used for all twelve plays, as we can tell from the badly-scarred E. The M of COMEDIA is the same M as in the COMEDIAS of the title-page — witness the left half of the serif at the foot of the left leg. There is no pattern in the movement of type which might indicate the use of several cases of type kept separate. If more than one case was used, no attempt was made to keep their types separate. There is no evidence of simultaneous composition of two formes, pages or columns in the first sixteen formes of the book; on the contrary, the evidence does not admit of simultaneous composition. In any case, simultaneous composition of a long book from manuscripts is not common: it is much more common in a page-for-page reprint. During my examination of the broken types, I also looked for differences in spelling, punctuation, setting-up, etc. I found none, either in the first play or in the whole Parte . Instead I found definite indications that the same man was at work throughout the book. I attempted to confirm these early findings from data on page-widths. The measure used in two-columned pages was of approximately 59 mm, and the columns were separated by a vertical spacer about 4 mm broad, making a total width of 122 mm, the same as in the prose pages of the preliminaries. I say approximately 59 mm: I am satisfied that a 59 mm opening was used throughout gatherings A — D, those I have been dealing with in this study. Measurements made in later gatherings showed that 59 mm was used for most of the book. Towards the end, however, the opening appeared to widen to 60 and then to 61 mm. The spelling remains the same, and the same damaged types occur in these gatherings. This kind of evidence is not helpful, as McKenzie has shown: "Not only do the widths of pages set by the same compositor vary considerably, but different compositors are often found setting to an identical measure . . . it is evident that differences of even 1 — 2 mm cannot be relied upon to indicate the end of one compositorial stint and the beginning of another". 11 There is certainly no evidence in Parte page-widths for two or more compositors, whether they worked simultaneously or consecutively. I next tried to obtain evidence from the dates of the book's various preliminaries. Vergara Salcedo's letter to Calderón is dated August 2, 1664. The plays, if not the preliminaries, had presumably been printed by then. They had certainly been printed a week later, for the Fee de Erratas and the Tassa are both dated August 9 (The tassa is simply the price, which was based on the number of sheets in the book). Calderón's letter to the Marqués de Astorga has no date. The aprobación of Dr. Manuel Mollinedo y Angulo, who judges that the book is very worthy of being published and given to the press, is dated June 15. The licencia of the Licentiate García de Velasco, who gives the permission to print, is dated June 17. Finally, the long-winded aprobación of the Licentiate Tomás de Oña, who describes the book as very worthy of being printed, is dated July 2. These dates appear to indicate that the book was printed between July 2 and August 2. July 2, 1664, was a Wednesday, so that the period from July 2 to August 2, inclusive, contains 28 working days, without making allowances for fiestas or the heat in Madrid at that time of year. The Tercera Parte has 136 formes without the preliminaries, which our single compositor, even working at the rate of one forme a day, would take four and a half months to set up. Thus to set up the book in 28 days would have needed four compositors working more than twelve hours a day, or five compositors working at a more human speed. I can see only two possible explanations for this: first, that the book was approved after it was printed, whether from the manuscript or from a printed copy. Secondly, that the manuscript was divided into four or five lots, as might be done for a page-for-page reprint, and that these were set simultaneously. This was the only possibility I had not fully investigated, since it involved more than the first sixteen formes. For example, one compositor might have begun at forme 1, another at forme 34, another at forme 68 and a fourth at forme 102. This would have entailed casting-off three-fourths of the book before starting: unlikely but not impossible, since a large percentage would have had to be cast off anyway. Four or five compositors dividing a large book between them would use separate cases of type, so I examined all 136 formes of the book for the distinctive types I had found in the first 16. I found at least one recognizable type in every forme. For example, I noticed the very distinctive 'g II' in 99 (Bb1 v , 2, 19), 123 (Hh2 r , 1, 28), 126 (Ii5 r , 2, 30), and 134 (Ll5 r , 1, 30). Although distinctive, 'g II' is not easily seen. Other distinctive types were seen to occur regularly, every two or three formes. Perhaps printing stopped temporarily after forme 60 and all the type was distributed, so that type from 60 occurred in 61. The more noticeably deformed letters vanished gradually, although others, no doubt freshly damaged, kept appearing. Obviously attempts were made to keep the stock of type in good condition. This evidence confirms that the same type was used throughout the book, including the gatherings where the measure was more than 59 mm. During the examination I noticed two lines which reminded me of others in En la vida . One was in También hay duelo en las damas , the last play: Quien las noches de vn Ibierno (Ii1 v , 1, 38). This is an uncommon (though not unique) spelling for invierno or ymbierno , unless it is misprint. I do not think it is a misprint, for it also occurs in En la vida : Ibiernos la elada yerua (A2 r , 2, 14). The second line reads, in En la vida : para que buelta la aguja, (C8 r , 1, 11). We know from the autograph manuscript that aguja is an error for quilla , and that Calderón is therefore remembering a passage in Góngora's Soledad Segunda (line 548). In Ni amor se libra de amor , the eighth play, we find the following line: al cielo la aguja buelta, (Z1 r , 1, 25). The sense here calls for quilla , not aguja , as later editors realized. (They did not realize it in En la vida , interestingly enough). I am not quite sure what to make of the two aguja errors. If they are the result of a coincidence, the coincidence is a surprising one. Perhaps they are the result of a compositor making the same error twice, or making the second because the first had already been made; possibly Vergara Salcedo was responsible. I am more certain about the Ibierno ; this, I think, suggests that one compositor was involved in setting the two plays concerned. Thus the editor and printers anticipated that official approval would be given, and printed either all or part of the book before permission to print was granted. There was little chance that twelve old Calderón plays which had already been granted performing licenses would be refused printing permission. 12 I do not see what could be gained by this, unless García Morrás simply began printing when it was most convenient for him. Possibly the censors actually approved the printed book. Thus we are left with evidence that admits of only one compositor. Had the press been printing only the work of this compositor, the edition would have been quite large: as many impressions as could be made in a day, assuming that the press was not under-manned (i.e., half-press working), and allowing for the fact that the compositor might have worked more slowly than one forme a day: say 1500-2500. This guess seems too many, although it bears comparison with the size of other Calderón editions printed in Spain about this time. These are the 1750 copies of the auto Las espigas de Ruth , seized by the authorities in 1703 and never published, 13 and the 3025 sets of Pando y Mier autos of 1717-18. 14 Calderón's autos were tremendously popular, however, and we are dealing here with editions published forty and fifty years after the Tercera Parte . Besides, the Tercera Parte appears to have gone into a second edition in the same year as the first. There is also an alternative printing method to that which might have produced 1500-2500 copies. Perhaps while our compositor was setting the Parte , other compositors were setting another book or books; these would be machined at the same time. If this happened, as it probably did, we cannot make an accurate guess at the size of the Parte edition. If there were two compositors, it would naturally be unnecessary to machine the work of both in equal numbers: the important thing would be to machine the two formes for as long as it took the compositors to set one each. Let us take an example. Suppose that B, our compositor, and A, a work-mate, start together and each finish setting one forme. The press takes A's work and machines it while A and B set half their second forme. Then the press machines B's first forme until A and B have completed their second forme. Thus B is just beginning his third forme by the time the press has finished his first. And if A is a faster worker, or began ahead of B, or if the press does more copies of B's work, B will be well into his third forme before his first comes back from the press: which is what seems to have happened, as we can see from the make-up of forme 3 (see above, p. 230). After all, although a modest firm would probably have only one press, it would surely have more than one compositor; and if only one compositor set the Parte , the others must have been working on something else. There was no need to rush out the first edition by putting several men to work on it, for several of the plays were at least a decade old, and none was brand new. The way to prove this would be to find a book that García Morrás printed at exactly the same time as the Parte . If it was printed with different type and perhaps had different spelling, we could conclude that another compositor worked on it from another case, and the hypothesis would be proved. There is another book printed by García Morrás in the summer of 1664: but examination showed that it was set by the compositor of the Parte , using the same type. I shall discuss this and other books presently. I also examined the second edition of the Parte , which purports to have been printed by García Morrás in the same year. Professor Wilson had already remarked that some of the gatherings of this book, viz., the preliminaries, A-F and Cc-Ff are printed with double-dotted 'j's. 15 I was able to confirm this difference by noticing that the 'p' used in these gatherings has a small bulb set rather high on the stem. This is a total of 11 gatherings out of 35, counting the preliminaries in each total. While I was looking through the rest of the book, I noticed that there were two other distinguishable founts. In one of them the 'p's have large bulbs and the 'g's have their loops further apart than usual. This fount was used to print the twelve gatherings following the first six. The third fount also has 'p's with large bulbs, but these bulbs and the bulbs of the 'q' are too high above the line — in fact, the letters as a whole are too high on the body of the type. In addition, the 'g' of this fount is different from the 'g's in the other two founts. The whole picture is as follows: ¶, A—F: fount 1; G — S: fount 2; T — Bb: fount 3; Cc — Ff: fount 1; Gg — Ll: fount 3. Thus there are eleven gatherings in fount 1 and twelve each in founts 2 and 3. One cannot divide 35 gatherings into three parts any more accurately. There seem to be two possible explanations for this state of affairs. These have to take into account the fact that none of the founts is the same as that used in the first edition. Thus none of the first edition's distinctive types is to be found in the second edition. Furthermore, the spelling used in the second edition, although varying within the book, is not the same as that used by the compositor of the first. The first possibility is that the date of 1664 is genuine and that García Morrás farmed out the whole book. The second is that the date is false and that although he printed some of the book himself, he had got rid of the old type he was using in 1664. I was able to eliminate a third possibility: that the date is genuine and that the book was set up by three of García Morrás's compositors, but not the one (nor his type) who set up the first edition on his own. If this third possibility had been fact, we would have expected running-heads and other recurring titles such as FAMOSA COMEDIA to be the same throughout the book. They are not, although certain headings recur in the various parts. In the fount 2 section (G — S), in which four plays begin, all that was common to the four headings was left in standing type and used in these four, but not in the other eight. Thus the whole book was farmed out between three printers, or García Morrás did one third and farmed out the rest. If he did do one third, he might have done the third which contains his wood-block (the coat-of-arms on the title-page), except that this third contains the double-dotted 'j's (see below). The division of work between three printers implies haste. There would be no need to rush out a second edition in 1670, say, but if the first edition sold out soon after printing, it might be expedient to get some more copies on the market quickly. One of the printers was possibly Joseph Fernández de Buendía, according to Prof. Wilson; he bases this suggestion on Fernández de Buendía's frequent use of double-dotted 'j's. This seems to indicate that García Morrás lent Fernández his wood-block and that he printed none of the book himself. 16 One thing troubles me: if the book was to be divided evenly between three printers, why was it not split into three instead of five parts of 7, 12, 7, 4 and 5 gatherings? This curious division would not make the printers' task any more difficult, of course, for they were printing a page-for-page reprint. Fernández de Buendía printed María de Zayas's Novelas (1664) and several other books between 1669 and 1672, all with double-dotted 'j's. 17 I have found a few such 'j's in his printing of Martínez de la Puente's Historia de Carlos V (1675). All the 'j's in his 1666 printing of Escogidas XXIII are normal, however. My attempts to find the same wood-blocks used in different books (there is a P in the preliminaries of the Tercera Parte ) have failed completely. However, none of this evidence conflicts with the suggestion that Fernández de Buendía printed part of the Tercera Parte in 1664, although I have another name to add to Prof. Wilson's list of those who used double-dotted 'j's: Lucas Antonio de Bedmar, in Escogidas XXXV (Madrid 1670). Every gathering has some of the 'j's, and the typographical style is different from that of Fernández de Buendía. I have not tried to discover anything about the compositors of the various sections; that is, I do not know whether any one section had one or more compositors. The book would not have taken so long to set up the second time. Only one thing appears to be certain, unfortunately: neither the compositor of the first edition nor his type took part in the printing of the second. Too little is known of García Morrás and his printing-house. I know of forty-nine items bearing his imprint, and since these carry dates from 1648 to 1678, his firm must have possessed some economic stability. The Parte was "done on the cheap," nevertheless. The paper is rough and lumpy (no "fine Genoa paper" here), the obvious compositorial errors frequent, and evidence of correction scarce. Vergara Salcedo, as editor, must also be blamed for this. We are unlikely to discover much more about Vergara (a few poems of his survive), but perhaps examination of other books printed by García Morrás would give us more information. I examined seven other books printed by García Morrás and a fragment of an eighth. The earliest of these was Fabricio Pons de Castelví's Gustavo Adolfo (1648). The size of the type is different from that of the princeps of the Parte , although the spelling is apparently the same. The standard of workmanship is poor. Next is Francisco de Vergara y Alava's Orden de Santiago (1655), a well-printed folio; the spelling here is quite different. The fragment consisted of one volume of a Latin-Spanish Virgil (actually part of the Georgics ); this has the date 1660, but the Fee, Tassa and foreword all bear dates in February 1661. The spelling is the same as in the Parte : in particular, I saw two examples of the word invierno spelt with no nasal and with a capital: Ivierno on p. 251, line 7, and the same on p. 253, line 15. The type seemed new, in good condition, possibly the same fount as was later used for the Parte . The capital 'T's almost certainly came from the same matrix, for all the 'T's of the Parte have the right arm higher and thicker than the left, just as they do in the Virgil. Next comes Juan de la Portilla's España restaurada por la Cruz (1661). Here the spelling is different from that of the Parte , and the type appears to be different from the Parte and from the Virgil: this implies another compositor with another case of type. In 1663 there is Mariana Caravajal's Navidad de Madrid : the spelling is apparently the same as in the Parte but the type is not the same size. In 1664 García Morrás printed Desiderio del Final's Viage de la famosa villa de Madrid a la ciudad de Roma . The aprobaciones and licencias cover the period from June 24 to August 21, whereas the Fee and Tassa are dated August 22; perhaps this is another example of an already printed book being approved. The spelling is the same as that of the Parte , and (more conclusive) so is the type. In a brief examination I found 'n' (18 v , l.26), 'p IV' (18 v , l.27), 'E II' (20 r , l.11), and the unmistakable 'g II' (26 v , l.10; see lists on pp. 245-247). The compositor may have worked on this at the same time as on the Parte , or immediately afterwards: it is a short little book, only seven octavo gatherings including the preliminaries (¶ 8 A-E 8 F 8—2 ). If the Parte was printed by August 2, as seems possible, the Viage could have been set and printed between then and August 22. The two remaining books are less interesting. One is the second edition of Francisco Santos's El no importa de España (1668). Spelling and type are different. The colophon describes García Morrás as "Impressor de el Estado Eclesiastico de la Corona de Castilla, y Leon." The other is Santos's La tarasca de parto (1672). It told me nothing. 18 Perhaps it would be helpful to examine more of these books, but there is still much more information to be obtained from the Parte itself, particularly on the subject of compositorial accuracy. In my introduction to En la vida I have examined the press-corrections at more length. All of them occur in the first columns of their respective pages, so that there is no proof that the second columns were also corrected. There were 34 variants from the autograph manuscript in these columns before correction and 26 after. Thus perhaps 8 in 34, or nearly 25 per cent of Excelmo 's En la vida errors occurred in the printing-house and could have been removed by presscorrection of all the formes (the many typographical errors in the other formes suggest that they were not corrected). Until comparatively recently it was thought that the Tercera Parte represented the first edition of all twelve plays contained in it. This is not so. The second part of La hija del aire appeared in 1650 in Comedias nuevas de diferentes autores, parte XLII (Zaragoza), ascribed to Antonio Enríquez Gómez. I have compared the British Museum copy of this with the U.L.C. Excelmo text, and find that they differ in only 170 places, of which 115 can fairly be described as corrections, or attempted corrections, made in Excelmo , of the Zaragoza text. I am quite certain that Diferentes XLII was used as the copy-text for Excelmo , for reasons which I need not give here in full: suffice it to say that the line-arrangement of the two texts is identical for the last twenty pages. The 115 "corrections" are sometimes quite ambitious but also, on occasion, obviously wrong. For example, Diferentes reads thus on p. 16, col. 2, 25-6: por deziros que el ausencia, / en mi no es madre el oluido. The second line does not make sense. The obvious correction is the simple "madre de oluido", but Excelmo reads: en mi nunca engendra el oluido. This correction cannot be what Calderón originally wrote, for it has nine syllables: nor would we expect Vergara Salcedo, himself a minor writer of verses, to make such an erroneous correction. However, a compositor working from a marked-up copy of Diferentes might easily have included the el which an editor had not properly deleted. en mi nunca engendra oluido , although probably not what Calderón wrote, is at least an apparently correct line: and the little we know of Vergara suggests that he would be likely to prefer the more pretentious version. Some efforts were made, therefore, to correct the copy-text of this play (there are more examples which do not read like the compositor's work). Thus all twelve Parte plays may be affected by editorial mis-corrections such as the one just quoted. I have seen some possible examples in En la vida , although thankfully few. For example: Autograph MS, I, 15-18. Excelmo . venga y en ora dichosa Venga en hora dichosa, tanto que halle a su ovediençia tanto, que allà su obediencia, con siempre Rendido afecto con siempre rendido afecto, su patria a sus plantas puesta su patria a sus plantas vea. The dropping of the y in the first line could have happened at any stage. The changing of halle a to allà is typical of the "close approximation" kind of error we associate with the copying of semi-legible handwriting; it suggests an intermediate stage where halle was spelt alle . The change from puesta to vea , however, is almost certainly a deliberate attempt to restore sense to the lines after the allà error had been made. Calderón, let it be emphasized, had no part in these emendations: his letter to the patron of the book indicates that he knew nothing about it until after the printing. So we have to contend with an edition printed from copy-texts that were corrupt not only because of bad copying but because of tampering by an editor who did not consult the author. More could have been said about La hija del aire , but Dr. G. Edwards is preparing an edition of this play. He shares my views about the Diferentes text and is using it as a basis. Prof. Wilson has already shown that would-be editors of La púrpura de la rosa , the tenth play, must consult the manuscript copy in the Bodleian Library. 19 I hope to have shown that an editor must use the Tercera Parte with great caution: it has no Calderonian authority, and some apparently correct readings may be due to tampering. No doubt the degree of corruption was different in all twelve copy-texts, but all the evidence points to a single compositor who was relatively accurate while working from a printed text (only 55 of the variants in La hija del aire II appear to be accidental), but who was probably much less accurate when working from manuscript, although this would vary with the legibility of the handwriting. The compositor set up the book as the First Folio was set up, from the middle of the gathering outwards. If he had set in order of pages, he would have needed to set eleven pages to complete the first forme: he did not do this because sixteen different types occur twice in the first eleven pages of the book. The rare occasions in the Parte when a sheet is impressed with the outer forme first are not important. They may well have arisen because the compositor was well ahead of the press, and had set a second and third formes before the press had finished with a first; the press would then print in the order 3,2, instead of in the order 2,3, in which they had been set. 20 We cannot make a reliable estimate of the size of the edition. Some copies of the Parte were certainly shipped to the Indies. Investigators who have examined cargo-lists in the Archivo de Indias in Seville report that "incredible numbers" of plays were shipped out in the seventeenth century, especially plays of Calderón. 21 The rate of survival of such copies as escaped destruction on the journey was practically nil, but it would certainly be helpful to know how many copies were loaded in Seville. (To take only one example: the loading register of the bark Espíritu Santo , dated March 22 1605, included 100 copies of Don Quijote ). We know, at least, that the Marqués de Astorga, to whom the book is dedicated, received a copy bound in gilt vellum; one hopes it was printed on decent paper. 22 Certain external difficulties stand in the way of a more complete answer to the problem: it took me a week just to examine four gatherings of six copies in the collating machine. And only three copies of the Parte are in Britain, the best-furnished country. Collation of the other plays would probably reveal more press-corrections which might indicate the reliability of the compositor's copy; and the make-up of the rest of the book could be established. The list of distinctive types follows. Here I used the same method as Hinman, i.e., a free-hand drawing on a card on which were then marked the places where the letter was seen. I refer to folio-numbers, since the first 32 folios are all correctly numbered.</field>

The Bilbao copies are not actually printed on fine Genoa paper. 15 "On the Tercera Parte of Calderon ", p. 230. 16 I know of one other surreptitious reprint which makes use of double-dotted 'j's (i.e. other than VS, the falsely-dated reprint of the 1640 Primera Parte — see Wilson's "The two editions of Calderón's Primera Parte of 1640", The Library , 5th ser., XIV (1959), 175-191); this is of the 1654 Góngora, originally published in Madrid. The pirated copy, bearing the same date and imprint but lacking the wood-block on the TP, and printed with double-dotted 'j's throughout, is said to have been printed in Zaragoza. The U.L.C. has a copy (Hisp. 7.65.3). I have a copy of the genuine edition, with ordinary 'j's. It is Palau ( Manual del librero hispano-americano , 104632) who suggests Zaragoza, I know not on what grounds. I prefer to believe that the reprint was by the Imprenta Real, which printed the original edition, or by Fernández de Buendía, who is known to have worked for that firm. Prof. Wilson (". . . Calderón's Primera Parte ", p. 188) also found one instance of the Imprenta Real's using double-dotted 'j's: it seems to me possible that this book too may have been farmed out by the Imprenta Real to Fernández de Buendía. Perhaps the second edition of the Góngora was printed after 1664 and the expiry of the ten-year privilege. 17 See Prof. Wilson, ". . . Calderón's Primera Parte ", p. 188. 18 For books printed by García Morras, see C. L. Penney, List of Works Printed 1601-1700 in the Library of the Hispanic Society of America (1938), and C.

      <field name="heading_text">Photo-Facsimiles of STC Books: A Sequel by Franklin B. Williams, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A few addenda and some further comment may be offered with respect to my 1967 "Photo-Facsimiles of STC Books: A Cautionary Check List," 1 although the flood of subsequent reprints forbids an effort to continue the list beyond its 1966 cutoff. Howard Staunton's 1866 reprint of the Shakespeare First Folio, acclaimed in my article (p. 112) as the first complete photo-facsimile of an STC book, was in fact preceded by an experimental Shakespeare quarto. Mr. John R. Hetherington of Birmingham calls my attention to an obscure reproduction of the 1600 Much Adoe about Nothing that I had overlooked at the Folger Library. It was photographed from the Ellesmere copy by R. W. Preston under "superintendence" of Staunton, and was published by photo-lith in 1864 by the London firm of Day and Son. The entire team is thus identical with that involved in the 1866 Folio. The product is of fair quality and now assumes pioneer honors as the first photo-facsimile. My censure of the concept of an ideal facsimile selecting the corrected formes from numerous copies (p. 110) now sounds ironic, since unknown to me, the Charlton Hinman facsimile of the First Folio was in active preparation. 2 Hinman uses no less than thirty of the Folger copies to achieve (a) not only the "corrected" condition of each page known in two or more states, but likewise (b) an example of maximum legibility. In the hands of a unique Hinman dealing with a book of relatively simple proof-reading, the method is reliable; indeed the product is essential for the scholarly world. Yet as Hinman points out (p. xxvii), "there are at least as many . . . miscorrections in the Folio as there are corrections." One fears that use of the method by less skillful hands might produce facsimiles of dubious textual authority. Except that the Bibliotheca Americana (p. 116) apparently lapsed after its two trial issues in 1966, the predicted flood of facsimiles has materialized. Supplementing its previous undertakings, the Scolar Press has launched 630 titles of English recusant literature before 1641, edited by D. M. Rogers of the Bodleian. In addition it now issues many important literary titles in cheap paperback for student use, placing them in Penguin price range. One questions whether Scolar maintains its hope of checking its facsimiles by Hinman collator, but in fact purchasers were supplied with a collotype reproduction to replace an unsatisfactory broadside in the Marprelate tract volume. The most ambitious new series, The English Experience, began appearing in 1968 under the imprints of Theatrum Orbis of Amsterdam and Da Capo Press of New York. The prospectus lists 1200 STC titles in all fields, with intent to extend coverage to an eventual blanket of needed titles. One fears that reprints on this scale will involve wasteful duplication with other series. George Olms of Hildesheim facsimiles some impressive titles. Alice Shalvi of Jerusalem edits Renaissance Library Facsimile Editions, a modest series handled by H. A. Humphrey, ltd., of London. Fifteen STC items are listed in The March of America, published by University Microfilms ("printed," but process not specified). In brief, output has reached a volume that justifies an annual Check List; the present writer will not undertake it. The wider aspects of reprints are arousing increasing comment, whether price and copyright problems or the simple difficulties of enumerative bibliography. 3 The Check List had a terminal date of 1966 but incorporated a few 1967 issues. Only two authentic addenda have come to light (together with one partial facsimile). A further 1967 item is added, since it might easily escape notice.
