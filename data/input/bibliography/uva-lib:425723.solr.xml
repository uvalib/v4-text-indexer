      <field name="heading_text">The Arrangement of Descriptive Bibliographies by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On 25 October 1963 the Times Literary Supplement published a short article entitled "The Soho Recipe," taking the appearance of Richard Fifoot's bibliography of the Sitwells as an occasion for reflecting on the series of Soho Bibliographies (p. 876). That series, begun in 1951 by Rupert Hart-Davis, 1 has been influential in the twentieth-century development of author bibliographies, particularly in regard to the division of material into sections and the assignment of reference letters and numbers to individual items within those sections. If in some respects the Soho volumes were uniform enough to suggest that a "recipe" lay behind them, in other respects their practice varied, as the TLS article pointed out; 2 and the questions raised in that article stem from the fundamental issue of whether uniformity of plan and technique among bibliographies is desirable. The article recognizes that without fuller rules the practices of each Soho volume are bound to "depend as much upon the temperament of the bibliographer as upon the tractability of the material," and it understands at the same time that more detailed rules could be "oppressive." Yet it cannot resist wishing for more uniformity in the treatment of certain matters, asserting that the reader has a right to find "agreement, or explicit reasoned disagreement, when two or more bibliographers describe the same book." There is, in fact, good reason not to believe that the reader of a bibliography has any such right, and the line of argument is implicit in what is said elsewhere in the article. Although the piece unfortunately does not pursue these issues very far, it is essentially enlightened in its approach, for it sees that questions regarding the presentation of material in a bibliography cannot be divorced from a consideration of the particular nature of the sources involved and the individual aims of the bibliographer. Differing Soho treatments of publishing history and "the biographical element in bibliography," as the TLS writer correctly states, result not simply from the extent of the preserved documents in each case but also from "the degree of enthusiasm and understanding which the individual has brought to his task." The "understanding" is crucial: when one understands that bibliographical research is historical research and that bibliographies are historical studies, one perceives that biography and publishing history are not separable from bibliography. One should also then see how naive it is to suggest that different treatments of the "same book" ought to agree or be in "explicit reasoned disagreement." Different bibliographical accounts of a book, even of the same copies of a book, may have different emphases, details, and arrangements, in the same way that accounts of any other kind of historical event are likely to vary according to the historian who is ordering the material. And if specific facts and figures are at odds, there are explanations other than that an error has occurred: perhaps the copies examined do not match, or perhaps the examiners have observed different tolerances in measuring or in reporting measurements. Sometimes scholars, in bibliography as in any other field, may find it appropriate to comment on the differences between their own accounts and those of their predecessors; at other times they may feel that the defects of previous reports, and the advances made by their own, are obvious and that the point requires no explicit statement. In some respects the TLS writer proceeds admirably from the recognition that bibliography is a branch of historical scholarship and calls attention to the fact that bibliographies vary according to the interests and points of view of their authors; at times, however—as in the expectation that two descriptions of a book will agree—the piece seems to reflect the narrow, but quite common, view that bibliographies are merely compilations, rather mechanically assembled. That a descriptive bibliography is actually a historical study has been understood since at least the time of Sadleir's Trollope bibliography (1928), which explicitly makes the case for an author bibliography as "a commentary on the book and publishing crafts" of a particular period. An author bibliography (as opposed to a simple guide to the identification of first editions) is a historical account of the production and publication of an author's works—and is therefore a partial biography of the author and a partial history of publishing in the period. 3 Its value, as with any other presentation of the results of historical research, depends on the thought that has gone into the assessment of the evidence and on the coherence of the overall conception, which determines the degree of relevance of specific data and the relative space and detail to be accorded them. What constitutes responsible handling of evidence and effective presentation of conclusions is the same in bibliography as it is in any other historical investigation; in bibliography as in other fields different people may find different patterns in the material, and more than one account can be responsible. (Whether or not any of them has arrived at the "truth" will of course remain an open question.) Fredson Bowers was certainly right, in his Principles of Bibliographical Description , to speak of bibliographies as "written," not "compiled." 4 All this is a necessary preamble to a discussion of the arrangement of material in a descriptive bibliography. Without seeing bibliography in the context of historical research in general, one might infer from such a discussion that definite rules for the arrangement of bibliographies could be prescribed. The fact that some parts of bibliographies are set forth in a formulaic way and not in straightforward expository prose has no doubt contributed to the notion that a bibliography is a compilation, subject to mechanical rules. What would it mean to ask how a history of a battle or a biography of a statesman should be arranged? Methodological reflections on the writing of such works can be useful, one but cannot set up a specific order in which the material must be presented. 5 This obvious point has not always seemed so obvious in relation to bibliography. But once a bibliography is recognized as a history, one must further recognize that the arrangement of its contents has to grow out of the nature of the material and out of the bibliographer's own approach and aims. There are always people, in all fields, who wish to be told what to do and who will proceed unthinkingly to follow instructions. Whether bibliography has more than its share of such people is hard to say; certainly anyone who has been associated with the publishing activities of a bibliographical society knows that requests come in from would-be bibliographers who want to know what arrangement of material the society prescribes for the bibliographies it publishes. Would a biographer ever write to a publishing firm asking whether its biographies were to be chronological or thematic in arrangement? Probably not, but in any case the point is clear: scholars of intelligence, who understand what they are doing, will work out in each instance the arrangement of material that serves their purposes. 6 Persons who need to be told how to organize their material have not given sufficient thought to their subject to produce useful results. 7 These, then, are reasons for not writing on the subject of the arrangement of bibliographies. In spite of them, I propose to do so, now that I have tried to make clear the context for my remarks. Discussions of methodology can be salutary in any field, and I intend here simply to set forth some of the considerations involved in thinking about the problem of arrangement in bibliography. My comments are meant to encourage such thinking, not to imply that a single scheme of arrangement can, or should, be declared standard for all situations. 8 The present moment seems an appropriate one for examining these matters, because in recent years some bibliographies have appeared that focus new attention on the question of arrangement—particularly as a result of increased examination of twentieth-century authors 9 and the attendant problems created by newer methods of plating. The first order of business is to look into the arrangement of the descriptions of the various editions, impressions, and issues of a single work. Then there is the question of how those composite entries fit into the bibliography as a whole—how, that is, the various kinds of material (books, contributions to books, contributions to periodicals, and so on) can be arranged in relation to one another. Finally, I should like to comment on the numbering of the entries, for reference numbering inevitably reflects the arrangement given to the material.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I One of the most basic problems of arrangement in a descriptive bibliography results from the obligation to identify the relationships among editions, impressions, and issues of individual works. The problem of arranging entries for a single work is not entirely distinct from that of the arrangement of the whole bibliography: if one decided, for example, that chronology were to take precedence over all other considerations, impressions would be scattered under the years in which they appeared and would not be gathered together as parts of a single edition. One would still specify the edition relationships in words, of course, but the physical arrangement would be determined by chronology—which is to say that classification is a different matter from arrangement (even though the clearest arrangements are likely to be those that reflect classification). Most bibliographers do, for obvious and good reasons, adopt a chronological arrangement within each section of a bibliography. 10 But chronology does not dominate, if it prevails only within each section. Furthermore, chronology is violated within a section if all editions and printings of a given work are grouped together. Readers are legitimately interested in the full history of a single work, but there is also a defensible interest in what happened in each year of an author's career—the mixture of first printings of new works and later printings of earlier works. 11 Since there is reason to have the material both ways, the approach chosen as the basic one should be complemented by an index that provides access from the other approach. One can argue that normally the most sensible basic arrangement is one that brings together all printings of a single work, for each entry can then build efficiently on those that went before and can conveniently be used in conjunction with them. More is gained by having each impression placed in the context of the printing and publishing history of the work than is lost by having the impressions of different works in the same year dispersed and retrievable only through a chronological index. This issue has rarely posed a problem, and bibliographers of authors have generally followed this plan, taking up an author's separately published works in the order of their publication and completing the publication history of each work before passing on to the next work. 12 However, they have not as routinely provided a chronological index, which—I think it hard to deny—ought to be a regular accompaniment to this scheme of arrangement. Where a difficult problem can enter is at the next step, after one has decided to group together the entries for the editions and printings of a single work—because the best order for those entries is not always readily apparent. There are many simple cases, of course, in which the order implied by the classification into editions, impressions, and issues can be followed without question: the successive impressions (subdivided into issues where necessary) of the first edition are followed by those of the second edition, and so on. But complications frequently arise that tempt one to add further organizing principles, superseding those inherent in the basic terms of classification. Although such situations occur fairly often in connection with books of the past two centuries (because of the growth of transatlantic republication of writings in English and the use of plates), earlier books can pose these problems as well. Even the chronological ordering of editions can be brought into question when, for example, a work appeared in a succession of editions on both sides of the Atlantic (and perhaps in other English-speaking areas). Should the editions be entered chronologically under each country, thus placing geography ahead of chronology as an organizing principle? Should this principle be followed when duplicate plates from one country are sent to another country, thus placing geography ahead of the classification into editions? Should it be followed when sheets with cancel titles are exported to another country, thus placing geography ahead of the classification into impressions? Within a single country, when duplicate plates are used during the same period of time by two publishers (as might happen if one publisher had the paperback rights or the rights to include the work in a cheap series), should impressions be grouped under each publisher, thus subordinating the chronology of impressions to the classification into plate families? Is the situation similar when a single publisher designates certain printings as part of a series? If plate families do not consistently coincide with particular publishers (or series), do the plate families or the publishers (or series) take precedence? These questions suggest that the problem of arrangement is not entirely separable from that of classification. (Arrangement need not follow classification, but an arrangement implied by the classification cannot be hastily dismissed, either.) And some people have regarded such questions as posing a serious challenge to the validity of the traditional system of classification, at least for books of the past two centuries. I do not think it necessary here to reopen the whole question of classification, which has in any case been extensively discussed already. 13 But I do think it appropriate, at the cost of some repetition, to affirm that 19th- and 20th-century printing technology, in which plating, photography, and computerization have reduced the need for resetting, has not made the edition-impression-issue classification any less relevant or helpful. The fact that many works printed in those years never reached a second edition because various means were available for reproducing the original typesetting does not render the concept of edition superfluous: it refers to the basic fact that all copies deriving from a single act of typographic composition, however diverse they may appear to be (even to the point of exhibiting different typefaces), are inextricably linked by that common origin. That works in sufficient demand to require more than a single press run were likely to appear in earlier centuries in a succession of editions (not subdivided into impressions) and in later centuries in a succession of impressions (of a single edition) suggests that the scheme of classification—far from being defective—is serving (as it should) to reveal fundamental differences in the physical relationships among copies in different periods. A question of more serious import concerns the relative emphases on printing and on publishing in the classification. There are times when printing history would entail one arrangement and publishing history another, and bibliographers are faced with deciding which arrangement should take precedence. When they look at the standard classification to determine whether it is built on one of these approaches rather than the other, they find that it involves both and are then sometimes critical of it and may decide to revise it, separating terms relating to printing from those relating to publishing. 14 Without doubt the edition-impression-issue hierarchy does involve both considerations, but whether that fact points to a flaw is far less certain. What the bibliographer is describing is published (or distributed) pieces, 15 since the activity of publishing postdates that of printing. Yet grouping copies according to publisher or to publisher's imprint dates (or copyright or copyright-page dates) leaves something to be desired, since impressions are sometimes not differentiated in these ways by the publisher but are always a fact not simply of printing history but of publishing history as well. 16 Because publication is an activity that involves the distribution of physical objects, the study of publication cannot be divorced from an understanding of the production history of those objects. It is not surprising, therefore, that the basic terms edition and impression refer principally to printing but that publishing enters more explicitly into the division of impressions into issues : a cancel title with a new date, for instance, does not affect the printing history of the work, for the sheets are of the same impression as those with the earlier title; but it reflects a publishing (that is, a marketing) decision, and the copies with the new title form a discrete publishing unit. Publishing decisions frequently leave their mark on the physical books; and even if the bibliographer's aim were limited to the classification of physical books, publishing history could not be divorced from printing history in the classification. Even though the mixture of printing and publishing considerations cannot be regarded as a defect in the system—it is, rather, a necessary element—there remain situations in which an emphasis on printing in the ordering of entries results in a different arrangement from the one that would emerge from an emphasis on publishing. Although this dilemma derives ultimately from the fact that the classification involves both printing and publishing, one must recognize that the practical question of what to do in such instances is usually concerned not with the classification but only with the physical arrangement on the printed pages of the bibliography. Thus if one were to decide, in a case where an American publisher issued English sheets with an American imprint (on a cancel or an integral title), to place the American issue at the head of a line of American issues and impressions carrying the same publisher's imprint, one would not be quarreling with the classification of the American issue as an issue —as a part of an impression—but would simply be emphasizing, through physical arrangement, the publishing history over the printing history. It is crucial to remember that these questions do not require the choice of one approach at the expense of the other: the main entry can be placed where it would fall in the publishing (or printing) history, and a cross reference can stand at the appropriate spot to reflect the other approach (or a separate chart or tree can delineate the second approach). 17 Still, one has to decide on one place or the other for the principal statement, and the decision is not without significance; it should be made thoughtfully in terms of efficiency of presentation, convenience for use, the overall conception of the work, and the particular nature of the materials involved. That more than one physical arrangement, reflecting somewhat different classification schemes, can be compatible with the larger edition-impression-issue framework is to be welcomed, not regretted; such flexibility within an accepted convention allows one to accomplish the basic task of classification in a way that can readily be understood by others and at the same time permits one to present the account in a way that emerges naturally from the material. 18 Only those who hope to avoid thinking (and who believe that bibliography can be a mechanical process) would wish to be told that a predetermined arrangement is obligatory. Nevertheless, the importance of having an established level of classification that falls between edition and impression is undeniable, for it would supply a standard means for placing together (both in thought and on the printed page) any impressions that constitute a separate group within the entire series of impressions. Fredson Bowers recognized this point years ago, in his Principles of Bibliographical Description , when he discussed the concept of "subsidiary edition" (or, for short, "subedition" or "sub-edition")—a concept that has been insufficiently examined and used since then. A subedition, as Bowers conceived it, would be formed by impressions with a different publisher's imprint, or those with an added indication of series, or those that might popularly be called "revised edition" or "enlarged edition" (that is, those in which the text is somewhat altered, but without enough resetting to be considered a new edition, or somewhat augmented, as with a preface or a new chapter). These kinds of changes result from publishing decisions: they generally represent the kinds of alteration that would produce issues if they affected only parts of impressions rather than whole impressions. The concept of subedition therefore makes formal provision for incorporating publishing considerations into the edition-impression classification, which is based primarily on printing considerations. One could, of course, enter all the successive impressions of an edition in a single sequence, even if all the impressions from a particular publisher, or in a particular series, did not fall together—as would happen, for instance, if the original publisher continued to place new impressions on sale while a second publisher produced impressions for a cheap series. Even though one could then supply a separate outline or stemma to show the groupings of impressions according to publisher, series, or the like, the basic arrangement would be awkward, since it would not explicitly recognize that printings from a single publisher (or in a single series) normally are more closely related with one another than with printings from another publisher (or in another series). Acknowledging that impressions fall into groupings by virtue of the publishing process leads to the belief that publishing history should be allowed to supersede the strict chronological ordering of impressions and that the subedition classification should be regularly employed. Whereas most options regarding physical arrangement are best left open for the bibliographer to determine in each situation, the value of allowing certain sequences of impressions to show up clearly as distinct groups lends support to the idea of attaching to them a term—like subedition —that indicates a classification intermediate between edition and impression and thus implies a particular arrangement. Any suggestion of a fixed arrangement, however, is not without its problems. Since subedition refers to publishing history, its use involves a potential conflict with printing history, if the groupings of impressions by sets of plates does not coincide with the grouping by publisher or series (or other characteristics encompassed by subedition ). 19 This fact has recently been explored by James L. W. West III, who suggests that the concept of plating should supplant that of subedition . 20 His article on this subject includes a valuable summary of the means thus far proposed for detecting the use of various kinds of plates; but his presentation of the concept of plating requires some further consideration, which I hope can serve as an example of how one may deal with conflicts of classification that in turn produce alternative physical arrangements. West argues that the grouping of impressions into subeditions, following Bowers's plan, with appended notes as necessary to identify replatings, "works satisfactorily for books with a simple history of plating but is not as efficient in more complicated situations" (p. 257). In addition, he says, "the root word of sub-edition is edition , a term which implies that type has been reset." Questions of terminology are obviously of a different order from questions of concept, and West is well aware of the fact, for he explicitly points out that any term can theoretically be assigned any definition. It is surprising, therefore, that he should introduce this second objection to subedition , which is an argument against using the term to refer to a group of impressions of an edition, for such an argument is irrelevant to the more substantive question of whether a publishing or a printing concept should provide the intermediate classification between edition and impression , at least for purposes of arrangement. Without explicitly raising that question, he in fact opts for printing history, for he proceeds to say that "bibliographical terms, if they are to gain general acceptance, should if possible describe what actually happens at the printing shop." This statement is not self-evident, because the bibliographer deals with published objects, and an equally good case could be made that publishing history should dominate over printing history when the arrangements deriving from the two are in conflict. There is something askew in the argument that subedition , incorporating the word "edition," carries "mental associations for a bibliographer which are inappropriate to what the printer has actually done" and that a "new term would be helpful"—for subedition was not meant to refer to what the printer did and is perfectly adequate to designate the various publishing practices it was intended to cover. 21 The real question is not whether the term is satisfactory but whether the concept it refers to is the most appropriate one to serve as the basis in a bibliography for the primary subdivision of an edition into distinctive groups of impressions. Although West asserts the primacy of the plating classification 22 and of the arrangement it suggests, he does recognize that in particular instances one may not manage to determine whether separate sets of plates were used. He says, "If plating did not occur (or he cannot prove that it occurred), then the bibliographer will simply use edition, impression, issue , and state as he always has" (p. 258). Does he mean that even in such situations differences in publishing arrangements are not to be acknowledged by a grouping into subeditions? 23 Whatever was meant, I believe that this question brings us to a significant point. Since subedition largely involves the kind of difference that within an impression would produce an issue, subeditions are usually recognized as such, for the differences were intended to be noticed as distinguishing discrete publishing efforts. 24 The fact that one generally knows when one is dealing with a subedition and frequently may not know when there are duplicate plates cannot in itself be an argument for or against a specific classification, for the desirability of a classification is not affected by one's failure to ascertain the information needed to apply it. Nevertheless, the bibliographer deals with surviving physical objects— normally objects that have passed through a publishing process or have in some way been distributed—and the groupings into which they fall, within an edition, as a result of the publishing process would seem to be the natural basis for arrangement. 25 Details of production history, including the identification of platings, are an important part of the total story and should certainly be recorded; but it would be hard in most circumstances to make a convincing case that those details rather than publishing details should form the primary basis for arranging groups of impressions in a bibliography. One can of course concentrate on the printing history of a given work and write a study of that history. But bibliographers ordinarily do not stop there; instead, they concern themselves with physical entities that made their way into the world and are now before us—entities that may be made up of parts with differing printing histories but that present themselves to us as published objects. This fundamental fact must affect all thinking about bibliographical classification and arrangement. 26 One might then ask why publishing details should not be dominant throughout, instead of adopting as basic the concepts of edition and impression , which refer in large part to printing history. Perhaps the most direct way to begin answering this question is to say that bibliographers actually use these printing terms as adjuncts of publishing history and are not focusing any less consistently on publication by adopting them. Indeed, the incorporation of subedition into the hierarchy illustrates the point. The bibliographer is interested not simply in identifying the impressions that derived from a single setting of type but in showing the varying publishing auspices under which they were released to the public. When, for example, a second publisher releases new impressions from the same setting as those released by the first publisher, the bibliographer cannot refer to the group of impressions thus created as an "edition," since that term has a well-established meaning that is broader. The adoption of a term like subedition reflects the bibliographer's view of an edition as a series of publishing units. Now it must be admitted that if this line of argument were carried to its logical conclusion, the result would be likely to satisfy no one: if, for instance, the seventh separate printing of a work to be released by a given publisher were actually the first impression of a second edition, it would be pointless not to reflect that fact in arrangement simply because it was judged to be a part of printing history, not of concern to the publisher, for whom all the impressions formed a single succession. In fact, the decision to order a new typesetting is a significant publishing decision, just as the decision to order a new printing from previously set type or from plates is a publishing decision. Although one can recognize a kind of logic in the notion of recording printing facts in one sequence and publishing facts in a separate sequence, a bibliography produced on this plan would be extremely difficult to use: books are so inextricably the product both of printing and of publishing that classification and arrangement should be expected to take both into account. Separate outlines of the two approaches might provide helpful guidance in some complicated situations, but the basic historical account must attempt to deal with both together. Favoring the publishing concept of subedition over the printing concept of plating as the primary classification intermediate between edition and impression for purposes of arrangement is consistent with the thinking underlying the process of bibliographical description as a whole. And, one might add, it does not mean that the question of plating should be investigated or reported upon any less thoroughly. The two approaches to arrangement can be efficiently illustrated by the simple example that West focuses on in his discussion of plating, William Styron's Set This House on Fire (1960). The two impressions published by Random House from that firm's original relief plates naturally come first. In West's proposed arrangement, the next entry is the impression distributed by the Book Find Club in 1960, because it was printed from new offset plates deriving from the first Random House impression, and it therefore represents the "second American plating" of the original edition. Following that comes the 1971 Random House impression, because it was not printed from the original Random House plates but from new offset plates made from the second impression sheets—and it therefore becomes the "third American plating": First American plating (relief): Random House First impression, March 1960 Second impression, September 1960 Second American plating (offset from first American plating, first impression): Book Find Club First impression, July 1960 Third American plating (offset from first American plating, second impression): Random House First impression, March 1971 Arranging the entries according to the chronology of plating means that the impression distributed by the Book Find Club intrudes itself into the sequence of impressions published by Random House. 27 Since only a single impression of the Book Find Club is involved, there is no great inconvenience here. But in a more complicated situation, there might be a succession of impressions released by a second publisher during the same time that the first publisher was also producing a series of impressions, and if one or more additional platings were ordered by either publisher, there could be a considerable amount of interspersing of the entries relating to the two firms. 28 An arrangement by subeditions would avoid this awkwardness, though obviously at the price of making the sequence of platings less readily discernible: Parent edition: Random House 29 First impression (original relief plates), March 1960 Second impression (original relief plates), September 1960 Third impression (offset from second impression), March 1971 Subedition: Book Find Club First impression (offset from first Random House impression), July 1960 This system allows for the orderly expansion of the list of impressions under each subedition, whereas the other emphasizes the orderly recording of platings. There is no question in either case of concealing any information, nor even of whether one system is a better classification than the other, for each emphasizes significant facts and both can be defended. The only question is which provides a better arrangement for the printed pages of a bibliography, where one entry must follow another (unlike a stemma, where simultaneous sequences of events can be shown side by side). What gives an edge to the subedition approach is, as I have suggested, its emphasis on books as published products. Since the impressions coming from a single publisher or published in a single series are likely to be closer to one another in physical appearance (title-page design, binding, and so on) than they are to the impressions from another publisher or series, a practical result of arranging entries by subedition is that similar impressions, many of which can be treated in abbreviated form ("the same as X except for . . ."), are grouped together and cross reference among them facilitated. As concepts of classification, subeditions and platings are both unquestionably important; as a plan of arrangement in a bibliography, giving priority to subeditions is likely to be more appropriate. Having arrived at this point, we are still left with what many would regard as the chief conflicts that produce difficulties of arrangement. I believe, however, that the line of thinking followed thus far prepares us for considering these other problems. Perhaps the central question —for it involves the others—is how to treat publication of an edition in more than one country. 30 Geography is not an element in the basic classification scheme, but publication history is, and it would obviously be possible to gather entries together according to country of publication, thus setting geography ahead of chronology as the primary organizing principle. If editions were never shared between countries, the problem would be relatively simple, though the best arrangement would still not be an obvious or easy matter to decide. What would be involved is whether a single chronological sequence of editions would be more, or less, useful than separate chronologies of editions under each country. Strong cases could be made for both approaches in particular instances, and I do not think a single rule on this point could fit all situations. The problem is often more complicated, however, for editions frequently are split between countries: among the possibilities are sheets issued with cancel title leaves and new impressions produced from offset plates. The further question in these cases is whether the description of a single edition, or a single impression, should be split up because parts of it were published in different countries. This question is significantly different from the one concerning the ordering of whole editions, for editions by definition are discrete entities, originating in separate acts of typographic composition. One can more comfortably contemplate the rearrangement of whole entities than a scheme of arrangement that necessitates the splitting up of entities and the entering of the resulting parts under different headings. The latter may be defensible, but the question is a more ponderable one. The difficulty is to some extent illustrated by West's example. In discussing Set This House on Fire , West asserts, "In a descriptive bibliography, it would be much better to separate the American publication history distinctly from the British" (p. 264). After listing the three platings of the "First American Edition," he proceeds to a parallel heading, "First English 'Edition,'" and records two further platings (Hamish Hamilton, 1961, and Jonathan Cape, 1970). Since of course the English platings do not constitute a different edition, he is forced to place the word "edition" in quotation marks in his heading and thereby to acknowledge that the American and English headings, though assigned parallel status, are not parallel in concept—unless one changes the concept from one based on typographic composition. In this particular instance, because of its simplicity, the grouping together of the two English platings (or subeditions, for in this case they coincide) causes no difficulty; indeed, they would appear at the same point (but without the heading) in a chronological arrangement, assuming that the 1971 plating were included with the other Random House impressions. But the awkwardness of the "edition" heading calls attention to the inherent problem, when impressions are split off from the edition of which they are a part. And there is is the further problem—not illustrated by this example from Styron—of parts of impressions (i.e., issues) that are released in different countries (and presumably by different publishers). Segregating entries by country may therefore require splitting up impressions as well as editions. Although I do not hesitate to recognize—as I have already pointed out—that bibliographical classification and arrangement involve a mixture of printing and publishing concerns, I still find something anomalous in the proposal at once to classify according to plating and to arrange according to country. Whether one chooses to give precedence to platings or to subeditions as subdivisions of each edition, one will then find in many cases that an arrangement by country works against such classification, since impressions from the same plating may be published in different countries, as may issues of an impression from a subedition. One might at first think that arranging by country would entail no more problems than arranging by subedition, since each publisher (or series) determining a subedition must be located in some country. The significant difference is that nationality adds another level to the classification and causes editions—not merely subeditions or platings—to be broken up. West rightly observes, "Increasingly in modern books, the American and British manufacturing histories overlap or derive from one another" (p. 265); but this fact would appear to be an argument against, rather than for, the separation of the records for the two countries. In all but the simplest cases it would probably be helpful to provide an outline of the publishing history in each country, with references to the relevant entry numbers. The question at issue is not whether the publishing history of a book in each country should be conveniently accessible but whether nationality provides the most desirable arrangement for the descriptive entries themselves. Unless we are to abandon classification by edition (and I see no justification for that), it would seem that keeping together all the entries dealing with parts of a single edition, rather than separating them by country, would in most cases make those entries easier to use and would present a more coherent account of the international intertwining of the printing and publishing histories of individual editions. In proposing this generalization, I have no wish to deny the usefulness of a country-by-country outline (in effect, a form of index to the entries) or to rule out the possibility of arranging whole editions by country of origin. The latter would serve little purpose if the former were provided; but my point is the desirability of avoiding the dispersal of the descriptions relating to a single edition. This approach can be extended to the treatment of issues: if impressions (or groups of them forming subeditions) are to be described under the editions of which they are a part, issues should be described under the impressions of which they are a part. 31 Scattering the description of a single impression poses the same problems as breaking up the entries for a single edition. If an issue bearing the imprint of a second publisher were given an entry independent of the rest of the impression on the ground that a different publisher is involved, the issue would have been accorded the status of a subedition, and yet its relationship to the parent edition would be very different from that of a subedition. As long as we are not giving up the classification into impressions, it would normally be desirable—for similar reasons to those already offered for the treatment of whole editions—to keep the descriptions of whole impressions intact. When the publisher of an issue turns up elsewhere in the record of an edition as the publisher of an impression, cross references could be provided, if the situation is complicated enough to warrant them, in order to facilitate reference to the full role of a given publisher in the history of an edition. 32 A rule of thumb, simply stated, therefore might be to treat editions and impressions as entities, not splitting off any of their constituent parts for description under some other heading. 33 This rule would allow for subeditions (or alternatively for platings), since any rearrangement they involve is of whole impressions, and it would not prevent the placing of nationality ahead of chronology for the arrangement of whole editions. 34 But in preserving intact the descriptions of individual impressions and editions, it fosters coherence in the basic historical account, which can then serve as a point of reference for any supplementary outlines or other aids that one may wish to provide. The following list of entries shows—for a purely hypothetical edition—what the arrangement might look like in a specific instance: Knopf parent edition First impression (relief plates): March 1921 Second impression American issue: July 1921 British issue: Cape, August 1921 [For Cape and Florin Books subeditions, see below] 35 Third impression: June 1924 Fourth impression (offset plates from third Borzoi Books impression): April 1930 [For Knopf Borzoi Books and Knopf (London) subeditions, see below] Boni &amp; Liveright Modern Library subedition First impression (offset plates from second Knopf impression): December 1921 Second impression: June 1922 Cape subedition [For Cape issue of second Knopf impression, see above] First impression (offset plates from second Knopf impression): January 1922 Second impression Cape issue: November 1922 Cape Florin Books issue: March 1923 [For Cape Florin Books subedition, see below] Cape Florin Books subedition [For Cape subedition and Florin Books issue of second Cape impression, see above] First impression (offset plates from second Cape impression): July 1923 Knopf Borzoi Books subedition [For Knopf parents edition, see above] First impression (offset plates from third Knopf impression): August 1924 Second impression: February 1926 Third impression: December 1927 [For Knopf (London) subedition, see below] Knopf (London) subedition [For Knopf (New York) impressions and Knopf Borzoi Books subedition, see above] First impression (offset plates from third American Knopf impression): July 1927 Second impression (offset plates from first British Knopf impression): September 1928 If this edition were organized by country, impressions would have to be broken up; and if it were organized by plates, the sequence of impressions by publisher would be disturbed. It could not be arranged by country and by plates at the same time, any more than the present arrangement by subedition is compatible with either of those approaches. Something must be sacrificed in the basic arrangement, but the loss can be made up by descriptive phrases and cross references at appropriate points, as suggested here, supplemented by separate schedules or stemmata and a thorough index. A central idea underlying the arrangement shown here is that the orderly listing of impressions by subedition allows for the most efficient use of a bibliography, given the fact that impressions from one publisher or series are likely to display more affinities in physical details with each other than with impressions from another publisher or series. This belief may not hold true in every case, but I think it carries enough weight to be worth proposing as a norm. Anyone who has thought through the rationale for this approach will be in a position to see when another arrangement would be preferable. A successful arrangement must be the product of careful thought about the material, not automatic dependence on a predetermined pattern.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Having decided the arrangement of the material relating to a single edition and to the editions of a single book 36 leaves untouched the larger question of the arrangement of the bibliography as a whole—the arrangement, in other words, of the entries for all the various publications that are a part of the author's career. That this question may seem less urgent suggests how entrenched a particular approach to overall arrangement has become and indeed is an interesting reflection of the history of the development of author bibliography. Most bibliographies today, as in the past, begin with a section describing the author's separate publications (whether book, pamphlet, or broadside), usually in chronological order; this section is followed by one (or several) recording books contributed to in some way by the author and then by one listing contributions to periodicals. The precise plan varies, but the general movement from separate publications to periodicals prevails. 37 The emphasis on books, with the concomitant subordination of periodical contributions, is achieved both by placing the books first and by according them detailed description, in contrast to the simple listings provided for the periodical pieces. Although one must admit that books generally are of greater significance and influence than periodical contributions, one must also acknowledge that this arrangement is an outgrowth of the original role of bibliographies as guides for collectors, who were (and have continued to be) more interested in books (including those containing the first book publication of pieces by the collected author) than in periodicals. Even though the trend from Sadleir onward has been to recognize bibliographies as works of historical scholarship—which in fact serve collectors much better than the overly simple guides did—the plan of arrangement has never outgrown its origins and comes to us now trailing its Wise-Sadleir-Soho lineage. 38 It is thus so widely accepted that it is generally not even thought of as an issue, whereas the treatment of an edition on a level of detail that would involve subeditions and platings is new enough to seem a pressing problem. The arrangement of individual works , however, has a more profound effect on the shape of a bibliography as a whole than does the arrangement of the editions of those works and their impressions. Actually there is much to be said for the traditional arrangement of works in a bibliography, even if it is not what historically underlies the arrangement. Certainly collectors interested in writers' careers should not have neglected periodicals, for contributions to periodicals may have been more important in establishing the authors' reputations than were separate book or pamphlet publications. Similarly, anthology appearances, also neglected, may play a greater role than book-length publications in extending a writer's influence. 39 Even so, form of publication is a basic fact that can serve as a useful principle of organization. Placing books first, contributions to books second, and contributions to periodicals third need not imply decreasing interest for collectors; it can simply refer to basic differences in type of publication, differences that form a natural basis for division into sections. 40 But however natural such an arrangement may seem, one should be aware in using it of other possible approaches that are thereby being rejected. In particular, chronology is being put in second place, taking over only within each section and not determining the overall order of entries in the bibliography. One could argue that the course of a writer's career might be better shown by a single chronological record of all the works, regardless of their length or their form of publication, arranged according to the dates of the first publication of each. 41 Readers of bibliographies, accustomed to the convention of describing books in considerable detail and periodical pieces in simple listings, might object that an overall chronological arrangement would result in an awkward mixture of single-line entries and multi-page descriptions. This objection is of course based on purely formal considerations and does not affect the logic of the arrangement. Besides, there is no reason why contributions to periodicals cannot be described as fully as separate publications are: they are equally a part of the author's career, and some of them may be more important than some of the books and pamphlets. In making these points, I am not arguing that a single chronological arrangement is necessarily preferable to the conventional plan; indeed, I think that the usual division into sections according to the type of publication may well be more appropriate in many situations. What I do wish to suggest is that bibliographers who choose the conventional arrangement should give some thought to what they are doing and not adopt it simply as a matter of routine. As with the presentation of any other research, the form should grow out of the special requirements of the material. The conventional scheme, though it was shaped by an old-fashioned and narrow approach to book collecting, can still be justified, but it is not law. Bibliographers should think the question through in each instance, taking into account the problems raised by the career they are dealing with. If one decides that there is good reason after all to separate the description of those books, pamphlets, and broadsides wholly or substantially written by the author from the treatment of composite publications (containing some work by the author along with work by other writers), one still has to consider what arrangement is best within these two categories. Whereas all the separate publications by an author—whether books, pamphlets, or broadsides—are usually kept together in a single chronological section, 42 the composite publications are normally divided into at least two sections, one for periodicals and one for books. The latter section (called "Contributions to Books" or a similar phrase) is sometimes further subdivided and in any case (whether subdivided or not) is likely to contain several kinds of items, as far as publication history is concerned: contributions (pieces written for, or at any rate first published in, a particular book—e.g., as an introduction or as a contribution to an anthology); collected pieces (writings for a periodical, now first collected in book form); 43 and appearances (pieces appearing in book publication for at least the second time). These distinctions are legitimate but have often been made by bibliographers primarily in order to focus attention on "firsts," following the lead of many book collectors in the older tradition. The first two of these classifications, referring to books containing the first publication in book form of pieces by the author, are sometimes described in considerable detail; but the items in the third group, not involving first book publication, are apt to be given abbreviated entries, or not even listed at all (as often happens with school and college anthologies). Frequently, however, this last category (especially the anthologies) plays a crucial role in the establishment of an author's reputation. And as far as textual significance is concerned, one cannot rule out any printing (even in an anthology) that appeared during the author's lifetime, at least not until one has investigated its publication history. 44 (Printings that prove to have no significance for establishing the author's intended text are still of textual interest historically: it is important to know, for instance, precisely what text of a particular work was encountered by thousands of readers in a popular anthology.) These points do not in themselves constitute an argument for or against placing contributions, collected pieces, and appearances together in a single section, but they should be kept in mind in thinking about the question. Firstness, after all, is not the only criterion of significance; and if non-first appearances in books are relegated to a separate section, the reason cannot be that they are less important than the other categories. However the entries are finally arranged, the bibliographer must make clear in some way which of these categories each entry falls into. 45 The trouble with some of the "Contributions to Books" sections in bibliographies is not that they mix unlike items but that they fail to comment adequately on the publication history of each item. Whether such a section should be subdivided (or whether indeed it fails to include enough and should incorporate contributions to periodicals as well) is a matter to be settled only by considering the nature of the author's publication record. In some cases separate sections will appear appropriate and helpful, and in other cases they will not. If division is decided upon, it will not necessarily be limited to the three categories I have mentioned, for further categories may be required by the material. Donald Gallup, for example, in his bibliography of T. S. Eliot (1969), gathers books containing letters by Eliot into a separate section. It is also worth noting that he places books edited by Eliot in the same section with books that have original contributions by him, whereas a bibliographer dealing with a different author might decide to create a separate section for books edited by that author. One might, in the case of an author who contributed many poems and stories to composite volumes, divide the entries by genre, recording the poems in one section and the stories in another. One might do the same thing, of course, for contributions to periodicals: 46 it is important to remember that a division between first printings and later printings or between verse and fiction is applicable to periodical pieces as well as to pieces in composite volumes and may on occasion be worth making for periodical pieces. The central point, here as elsewhere, is to think about the categories that are most useful in a given situation and not to accept mechanically any plan simply because it has already been used for a different body of material and has achieved a measure of acceptance. The amount of detail recorded for individual items is, as I have said, a separate matter from the arrangement of those items. Nevertheless, the two questions continually intersect, as the foregoing has made plain. Sometimes the implied reason for the separate listing of a certain category of material is the difference in the treatment accorded it, which in turn reflects its perceived importance. These factors are not entirely separable, therefore; and if a formerly subordinated category is shown to deserve fuller treatment, there is then no formal reason for its segregation, though there still may be a substantive reason. The general issue of the relative elaboration of detail deemed appropriate for different entries is still referred to by the label Falconer Madan gave it in 1906, when he spoke of "degressive" bibliography. 47 Although this is not the place for a full consideration of the "degressive principle," 48 I think it fair to say that the idea of giving more extended treatment to some materials than to others is generally accepted; in any report of research—or in any piece of writing, for that matter—one must decide which are the principal aims or emphases of the work and which are the subordinate ones and then adjust the relative proportions accordingly. One cannot be faulted simply for giving less attention to certain matters or certain editions, for one cannot do everything; what is significant is the intelligence with which the decisions to emphasize or subordinate are made. Bibliography is not the only field in which such decisions are often made unwisely; but the frequent failure to understand that descriptive bibliographies are scholarly accounts, not mechanical compilations, has meant that some conventional practices in the field have been routinely accepted without sufficient examination of what rationale justifies them. Bibliographers do sometimes give evidence of having thought about why they have decided to describe in less detail editions published after the authors' deaths; but it is rare indeed to find that they have thought about why they simply list, rather than describe, contributions to periodicals or why in many cases they describe books contributed to by an author in less detail than books entirely written by that author. Are not composite volumes books, with all the potentialities for variation, in both text and physical makeup, that other books have? And are not periodicals the same as composite volumes, being printed matter made up of contributions by various writers? Why, then, has the custom grown up of giving them slighter description, or none at all? 49 In large part the reason is that collectors have not in the past been very interested in these kinds of material. Books containing original contributions (or even pieces first collected in book form) have elicited greater interest than posthumous editions or periodical pieces, and these degrees of attention are still often reflected in bibliographies (even those by bibliographers who understand that in part they are writing publishing history). A defensible argument can in fact be made for these proportions, but only on different grounds. As a chronicler of an author's career, one cannot justify downgrading periodicals or classroom anthologies or late editions, or even the less severe subordination of books with original contributions or with first reprintings in book form: all these publications have played their roles, small or large (often very large indeed), in the author's career. One may of course decide, as in any research, to focus on certain aspects of one's subject or on certain events or publications; but some forms of publication are not inherently less in need of full description than others, for all are printed items, in which production history and textual content continually intersect. The justification for giving some classes of publication less detailed treatment is more convincingly made on practical grounds: one may have to cut down somewhere in order to make the task manageable enough to complete at all. A natural place to cut may seem to be composite volumes and periodicals, for one may feel that these publications, involving many authors, are not primarily the responsibility of the bibliographers of the individual authors included in them. A considerable duplication would indeed result if such books and periodicals were extensively described in the bibliographies of all the authors appearing in them; the preferable situation would clearly be for bibliographers to write separate descriptive bibliographies of individual periodicals and of specific groups of anthologies. 50 But research cannot be forced into such orderly paths, and scholars cannot very responsibly adduce the possible future duplication of effort as a reason for not pursuing in the present certain lines of inquiry relevant to their subjects. They can say that they are focusing on books wholly written by an author, rather than books and periodicals contributed to by that author, simply because they find the former a more interesting subject and because they do not have the time or energy to deal with the latter. Such reasoning is hard to quarrel with, even when it results in bibliographies that seem to many people to have obvious deficiencies. But one may indeed protest if the basis for proceeding in this fashion is the idea that periodicals and books with contributions do not deserve or require so thorough a treatment—or if the bibliographer is following, without examination, the notion that bibliographies are always done this way. The same thinking applies as well to late or posthumous editions and printings of the author's own books. Some of the discussion concerning the degressive principle has centered on the question whether full attention to such editions and printings would not involve shifting the focus of the bibliography from the author to the printing and publishing history of a later period. As long as one recognizes, however, that an author's text is inextricably bound up with the printing and publishing process and that later editions and printings—with the particular texts they contain—are crucial for understanding the course of an author's reputation and influence, one cannot defend abbreviating their treatment on these grounds. 51 One can simply declare that one is dealing only with printings appearing during the author's lifetime, or during any other specific period, for one is naturally free to set—indeed, must set—limits to the scope of one's work. The decision to use (for instance) the date of the author's death as the dividing line between full and shorter entries can be respected (though not welcomed) if it is made for practical reasons—but not if it results from the bibliographer's belief that sound bibliographical theory requires, or at least supports, the distinction and that later printings are more properly treated by the student of printing and publishing than the student of the author. My point, as before, is that bibliographers should think about each situation in its own terms and not complacently accept some preconceived plan. Degressive descriptions are certainly defensible, but the categories offering the best candidates for less detailed treatment are not necessarily the same from bibliography to bibliography. Whether the decision to give certain items less full treatment precedes or follows the decision to group the entries for those items in a separate section, the two questions are related. What we must avoid—or else bibliographical scholarship will suffer—is allowing a particular arrangement, which often implies particular levels of detail, to become so established that we accept it without thinking about how it contributes to the ultimate goals of our work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Another question related to arrangement is how best to number the entries. The numbering can of course only reflect, and not determine, the arrangement of the material, and in many ways it is a trivial matter. Unquestionably there is a convenience in having entries numbered for reference, but one might assume that any system of numbering (or lettering), as long as it enabled one to locate an individual item, would serve the purpose. And so it would. Difficulties arise only when one wishes to make each number convey more information than simply a position in a sequence of entries. Bibliographers have been increasingly concerned with inventing entry numbers that reveal the place of an item in the general scheme of organization of the bibliography in which it appears. In early author bibliographies entries were either unnumbered or (as in Sadleir's Trollope ) assigned simple consecutive integers, from 1 onward. Even after letters were introduced to identify the sections of a bibliography, the entry numbers still might be a straightforward numerical series within each section; thus in John Slocum and Herbert Cahoon's bibliography of Joyce (1953), entries 3, 4, 5, and 6 in section A all are concerned with Chamber Music . 52 A further development, generally associated with the Soho series and widely imitated in other bibliographies, was to assign a single number to each work and then to identify various editions with an attached lower-case letter ("A3b" would refer to the second edition of the third separately published work by the author). This system was sometimes used illogically, with the appended letters occasionally referring to selected impressions (often subeditions) or issues as well as editions; and the Pittsburgh Series in Bibliography, beginning in 1972, sought to refine the system. Although the Pittsburgh volumes have varied somewhat from one to another, the general approach was set by Matthew J. Bruccoli, general editor of the series, in his bibliography of F. Scott Fitzgerald (1972). He employed references such as "A8.1.a*," in order to specify impressions ("a") and issues ("*") as well as editions ("1"). 53 There can be no doubt that his reference numbers follow a more rigorously logical system and convey more information than those previously employed—though at the cost of some rather cumbersome combinations. The discussion of entry numbering has not stopped there, however, for Craig S. Abbott, the author of another Pittsburgh bibliography (of Marianne Moore, 1977), has written an article on the subject, proposing a system that goes beyond Bruccoli's by taking subeditions into account (although he confusingly calls them "issues" and thus uses "issue" to mean two different things). 54 Each of his numbers contains a single period, which follows the edition designator; after the period, the figure indicating impression can be combined with lower-case letters to mark subeditions (if the letter precedes the impression number) and issues (if the letter follows the impression number), as well as with parenthetical numbers to mark states. An Abbott number might therefore look like "A9b.a6b(2)." The same number might even become "A9 b .a6[b](2)," since italics specifies simultaneous publication 55 and brackets denote indeterminate order. Nor is this all, for if one accepts the suggestion that roman numerals be used for volume numbers and parenthetical letters for binding variants, one might have "A9 b .a6[b](2)II(b)." Abbott's proposal has not put an end to the devising of systems: James L. W. West III, in his Styron bibliography (1977), sets forth and uses still another scheme 56 designed to convey almost as much, if in part rather different, information. An example of West's notation is "A4.I.a.1 † b ," in which roman numerals refer to editions, lower-case letters to platings, arabic numbers to impressions, and superscript letters preceded by daggers to issues (superscript letters preceded by asterisks signify states). Both Abbott and West recognize the need for a level of classification between edition and impression , but one chooses subeditions and the other platings. As we have already noticed, these two approaches cannot be employed simultaneously for the actual arrangement of entries; they could, however, be combined in reference numbers, but such numbers—containing elements that do not relate to the position of the entry in a bibliography—would raise the fundamental question of what the function of reference numbering is. Indeed, the systems of Bruccoli, Abbott, and West already raise this question, for each seems to be moving beyond the use of the number as a locator for an item and toward the idea that the number is part of a notation system for recording in shorthand fashion many of the significant aspects of any copy of a book. One may begin to think about this matter by observing that the complexity of a reference number does not increase its usefulness for locating an entry in a bibliography. Simple whole numbers, unencumbered with letters or decimals, will serve as well as complex combinations; in fact, they are preferable for this purpose, for they are generally easier to print in an index and (unless they are very long) to remember. The motivation for elaboration is obviously the desire to make the numbers meaningful and not merely arbitrary, and up to a point making them meaningful may also make them easier to remember—and at the same time makes an index particularly efficient, since each reference conveys some further information without the need for explanatory phrases. But as the impulse to elaborate grows, a point can be reached where the numbers are no longer very efficient simply as references, and their primary function becomes the provision of a coded statement. The latter approach is taken for granted by Abbott throughout his discussion. "The importance of reference numbers," he says at the outset, "has increased in recent years, largely because bibliographies that seek to be definitive must now reflect the findings of extensive machine collation." To anyone who thinks that reference numbers exist primarily to facilitate reference, the idea that their importance is affected by machine collation will be incomprehensible. The connection is not greatly clarified by his next sentence: "The numbers are needed to signal the ordering of more complex bodies of work and more complete descriptions of the various impressions and issues of an edition." Complex organization and description do not require complex reference numbers unless those numbers are meant to convey fairly detailed information about the items referred to. And whether the numbers ought to perform that function is not a question with an obvious answer. Actually Abbott appears less interested in the labeling of entries than in the construction of a symbolic language for referring to books. By providing for the specification of binding variants, for instance, he is going beyond what would be called for in an entry number, since binding is only one of the matters that would be covered in an entry, and since other parts of the entry would deal with features that do not vary, or vary independently of the binding. His system seems headed in the direction of offering a means for denoting specific copies of books. He also explicitly claims another use for his reference numbers: "exact reference in apparatuses such as indexes of textual variants." An example of what he means is the use of index entries to sketch the textual history of a work by arranging the references in chronological order (thus often placing periodicals or anthologies before books by the author) and substituting other marks for commas to separate the figures (an equals sign to mean no revision and a plus to signify revision): "Ba55a=Ba55b=A1+A3.1+A3.2" (p. 73). This suggestion (though it is unlike the previous one in not tending toward the specification of individual copies) again assumes the value of making utilitarian references convey additional meaning: if reference numbers are to encode information about the items referred to, then an index citing such numbers is perforce informative, even without explanatory phrases, and one is naturally tempted to make it still more informative through the addition of a few more symbols. Obviously one can use any reference number, however bizarre or unwieldy, to locate an item; one just accepts whatever number is provided and makes do with it. For this reason the whole question, as I have said, may be considered trivial. The only thing that makes it worth discussing is the possibility that a complex number may offer little, if any, advantage to compensate for its awkwardness. There is no question that many of the aims proposed as reasons for the elaboration of reference numbers are in themselves worthwhile; the issue is whether there is any point in attempting to achieve those aims by means of the reference numbering. The use of a classification scheme for reference numbers does frequently occur in certain areas, as in the arrangement of books on library shelves, where the motivation is to maintain a meaningful order and therefore to allow for indefinite expansion at any point. For the same reasons subject checklists may sometimes employ numbering systems akin to library classification schemes. In a descriptive bibliography of an author or publisher, on the other hand, or of an area or genre during a particular period, expandability has not generally been a major concern, even though new printings or editions of particular works may occur, and new works may be discovered. The elaborate systems that have been used in author bibliographies in recent decades do provide for the addition of later editions and impressions to a sequence already begun but do not conveniently allow for the future discovery of editions, impressions, or works that would need to be interpolated between those already recorded. Embedded in these systems, therefore, is the same problem of interpolation that exists with a simple system of single sequential numbers. Letters or decimals can always be added, but if the references already contain letters and decimal points the result will be even more awkward. In any case such additions would decrease the utility of the references as conveyors of information, for numbers or letters would then not necessarily indicate the absolute position of an item in a series: "A9," for instance, would not mean the ninth book or pamphlet if "A6.5" had been inserted between "A6" and "A7." (The same would be true, of course, if numbers were skipped over in the original plan in anticipation of insertions.) It is clear, in other words, that the increased complexity of reference numbers has not produced an improvement in the way in which insertions are handled. Any possible benefits from their complexity must be looked for in another direction. Those who have devised these complex systems obviously did not intend them to facilitate insertions but were concerned instead with creating references that would convey considerably more information than merely the location of an item in a bibliography. In fact, allowing for insertions, as we have just noticed, would in some respects work against the provision of information; the irony of this situation is that the former is a clear responsibility of reference numbering, whereas the latter is not directly related to the job of reference at all. This confusion of priorities is curious, since these systems were specifically designed for use in numbering entries; but from the results one can see that the designers were really interested in something else. In effect the goal of each (an explicit goal of Abbott's) was to develop a system of notation for referring to particular printings of particular editions of particular works; they then proposed to use this notation for numbering entries, without examining whether it was appropriate for that different purpose. Many of the situations in which bibliographical citations are used involve contexts that make such notation superfluous. A dealer's catalogue entry, for example, would make clear that the item described is a second printing or a third edition even if the appended citation included a reference number encoding that fact; the citation is purely a reference to a standard authority, and a simple arbitrary reference number would be no less informative in such a context. In an index to a bibliography a case can be made for reference numbers that contain some informative elements, in order to eliminate the need for certain subheadings; but reference numbers of considerable complexity rarely offer additional benefits in an index, for they (however informative) cannot substitute for the entries themselves and are no more efficient in guiding one to the places where full information can be found. Abbott's idea that a notational system can be useful in an index to show textual revision is doubtful for similar reasons. Stringing the notations referring to particular editions together with plus and equals signs cannot possibly convey much about the textual history of a work and can neither substitute for the textual information that should be present in the actual entries nor direct the reader more effectively to those entries. 57 Numbering for reference purposes, one must conclude, is not likely to be assisted, and may be made more awkward and inconvenient, by the assumption that some kind of work-edition-impression-issue notation can serve to form the reference numbers. But to say this is not to imply that such notation may not have value for other purposes. Formularies for concise notation are always potentially useful, to be drawn on at those times when saying the equivalent in words would be cumbersome and would impede the flow or reduce the clarity of a statement or discussion. However, a system for reducing phrases like "the second issue of the second printing of the third subedition of the first edition of the author's sixth book" to symbolic form cannot be expected to play as central a role in description as the formulary for signature collation does. In setting forth a collation formula one is making a substantive statement that would nearly always be less clear if expressed in words, and one can use symbols that remain constant in their signification from book to book. The places where one may at first be tempted to use a work-edition-impression notation, in contrast, will often prove to be places where the substantive content of the notation is not necessary (and any kind of reference number will do as well) or places where words seem preferable in the context; and while the general system can remain the same from book to book, the effective meaning of the symbols will vary. In bibliographical discourse there is frequent need to refer to a particular leaf or page—as a physical object—in terms of its place in the structure of a book, quite apart from any concern with what is printed on it; but there is relatively little occasion to cite, for instance, the third edition of an author's second book as such, without intending that the reference be translated into a particular title, publisher, and date. Nevertheless, I would not wish to deny that a standard notation for this purpose may be desirable. My only concern is that symbols not be needlessly multiplied. Some of the more elaborate possibilities derived from these proposed systems, like the one cited earlier tending toward the specification of an individual copy, lead one to anticipate an eventual row of symbols beginning with a Library of Congress classification number (and perhaps an International Standard Book Number), followed in turn by a number of the Abbott or West type (including symbols for states of sheets and binding variants), a signature collation, a "fingerprint" (as proposed by John Jolliffe), 58 a National Union Catalog symbol for the library holding the copy, and the call number or shelf mark of the copy. What purpose might be served by this long sequence I am not sure, though I am willing to believe there is one. But the piling up of symbols can, I think, be extended beyond the point of usefulness. A potential danger is the blurring of the distinction between reference to individual copies and reference to a scholarly description of an entire edition, impression, or issue 59 —which is to say, the distinction between an entry in a catalogue and an entry in a bibliography. Reference numbers attached to entries in a bibliography cannot be references to specific copies but must be references to accounts based on the examination of a number of copies. This central distinction can be maintained, and maintained efficiently, by a two-part plan operating within each entry: (1) a record of copies examined is placed at the end of the entry, each copy (sequentially numbered) identified by library symbol and call number or accession number, followed by an indication of defects or peculiarities that result from the post-publication history of the copy (and therefore not encompassed by the concept of ideal copy ); 60 (2) any variation, among copies on which an entry is based, that results from the printing and publishing process (and is therefore encompassed within ideal copy )—such as states of a given leaf or sheet—is documented parenthetically by the citation of the numbers assigned to the copies containing the variation in question. Whether or not one wishes to distinguish in form the references to entries from the references to copies (as in "copy 5" of "A9b"), the distinction is basic and must not be lost sight of. We now return, by what may seem a circuitous route (but is, I believe, a necessary one), to the matter of arrangement. Entry numbering can be expected to reflect arrangement, but some kinds of numbering, when adopted as a standard and rigidly applied, can also determine arrangement. For example, I have heard people refer in a general sense to "A items" and "B items"—by which they mean books wholly written by an author and books contributed to in some way by the author. This usage, roughly reflecting a widespread (but by no means universal) bibliographical practice, in turn influences other bibliographers to set up their bibliographies in the same fashion. Although bibliographers should certainly survey the practices of their predecessors, they should not be content to have imposed on them a system of arrangement (or a system of numbering implying an arrangement) that does not emerge from the circumstances of the particular bibliography they are working on. There is not, in fact, any great uniformity in the definition of the B section, so that general allusions to "B items" are not very precise. If one uses the term simply to mean "books contributed to by the author," then one is referring to items sometimes included in the A section (e.g., books edited by the author) and others at times separated into C or D or E sections (e.g., if books containing original contributions, collected pieces, appearances, and letters are segregated). Presumably one might deplore this lack of uniformity if one could adduce an overwhelming reason for the necessity of a term like "B items." But it serves no useful purpose—any more than the presence of the "B" in dealers' citations tells one something not already stated in their descriptions. Certainly there can be no reason for such a usage that is worth the price of having to submit to a single scheme of arrangement prescribed in advance. In speaking about a particular bibliography, one might wish to refer to "B items" or "F items"; the terms would be clear in the context. But when such terms are used to refer to bibliographies in general, their function is shifted from the descriptive to the prescriptive, making reference numbering an organizing force rather than a reflection of organization. It follows that bibliographers should feel no less bound to use "A" for a section dealing with books by an author than to use "B" for a section recording some or all of the other books with which the author was associated. One should first plan the arrangement of the bibliography and then see what numbering system would be most appropriate in that particular instance. It could well be that one would decide to use "A" for the author's first published book, "B" for the second, and so on, with appended numbers for editions. The description of the various editions of books wholly by an author often occupies as much as two-thirds or three-fourths of the bulk of the bibliography; 61 prefixing an "A" to all the entry numbers in such a long section, as is commonly done, would seem to lengthen those numbers needlessly. Instead, one might assign letters sequentially to the succession of books, thereby saving one character in each entry number, and switch to the use of letters for whole categories of works at the point where the record of contributions to books begins. It is true that labeling the author's books "A" through "S" and then using "T" for all the books contributed to, for instance, means that letters are not used in parallel fashion throughout. But I see no disadvantage resulting from that fact. One can always use sectional divisions, like "Part I," "Part II," and so on, to mark the large units of a bibliography, without wasting spaces in the entry numbers for this purpose. Although the entry numbers throughout a bibliography must form a single sequence if they are efficiently to serve the function of reference, there is no reason why any given element in those numbers need have the same "meaning" throughout. It is only because bibliographers sometimes place the classification function ahead of the purely reference function in their numbering that they may think otherwise. But there is nothing illogical or impractical about employing different forms of numbering in different sections of a bibliography where different levels of detail are recorded; 62 one could still, if one wished, use in any particular section of a bibliography a system emphasizing classification, in which each element must consistently signify the same thing. Devising a system of numbering that conveys some information is not necessarily a bad thing, for, as I have noted, such numbers can be useful in an index. As long as one resists the temptation to overload the numbers with informative elements—to the point where one loses sight of the primary purpose of the numbers and makes them less efficient for reference—a system that builds some meaning into the numbers can in many cases, through its mnemonic value, actually facilitate the job of reference. How much detail is too much cannot be arbitrarily stated. Let me suggest one approach that might seem appropriate in some situations: information down to the level of impression could be expressed in three characters by using capital letters to stand for works, arabic numbers for editions, and arabic numbers following decimal points for impressions, as in "C1.2." Eliminating the traditional letter standing for the whole section of the author's own books effects a significant economy. As a result, one may feel freer to insert one more element, representing subeditions, which should be taken into account if impressions are to be specified. Subeditions could be indicated by lower case letters following the edition numbers, as in "C1b.2," clearly reflecting the fact that a subedition is a part of an edition and has its own sequence of impressions. 63 I would in most cases be reluctant to encode further information, and even these four characters would no doubt seem excessive for some bibliographies. 64 My suggestion of this scheme is in the spirit of what I have said earlier, and therefore I am not in any sense proposing it as a standard. I intend it only as an example of what one might come up with if one recognizes the folly of feeling bound to any single system previously employed and understands the distinction between reference and classification. It would obviously be inappropriate, without modification, for an author who published more than twenty or so books, since there might not be enough letters to cover those books and any additional categories that would have to be included; nor would it probably be appropriate if books contributed to by the author were treated in the same detail as books wholly by the author, since both categories should then receive the same kind of reference numbering, and again the number of letters might be insufficient. One solution in these instances, rather than the awkward doubling of letters, might be a reversal in the use of letters and numbers, letting numbers stand for books and letters for editions. 65 That solution illustrates how the reference numbering grows out of the particular situation; but I am less concerned here with the solution in a specific instance than with the process of thinking involved. One must first decide on the arrangement of the material; then one can consider whether the entries thus arranged are better referred to by a straightforward series of consecutive numbers or by a sequence of more complicated numbers that reflect in some degree the classification scheme already adopted; and if the latter approach (which is by no means an obvious choice) is selected, one can then think about the system that will best serve the function of reference and at the same time reveal some (how much is a further question) of the information conveyed by the arrangement. The numbering of entries is clearly dependent on the arrangement of the material. And the arrangement of the material emerges from the process of thinking about the material. The question of arranging material in a bibliography is inextricably connected to the whole process of historical research and writing, to the problem of finding order in the raw material of history. The way in which results are presented is central to the meaning one has found in the historical record. I have ventured some opinions here about such matters as the ordering of impressions and issues, the degressive and segregated treatment of anthologies and periodicals, and the numbering of the resulting entries, but I regard my comments less as solutions than as examples of thinking. Writing a bibliography is not a mechanical task, and the urge to follow mindlessly a set of instructions will produce no better results in bibliography than anywhere else. The quality of a bibliography, like any other intellectual product, depends on the quality of thought that has gone into it. The arrangement of the material is a basic reflection of that thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 And continued at present by Oxford University Press. (Some of the volumes published by Hart-Davis are being reprinted—often with addenda—by St. Paul's Bibliographies.) 2 In reviewing the revised edition (1971) of the Fifoot bibliography, B. C. Bloomfield remarks, "It is doubtful whether there ever was a Soho formula, but there was, and is, a general style"; he then specifies some features of it that bear reconsidering ( Library , 5th ser., 28 [1973], 76-77). 3 This point of view is fundamental to Fredson Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949); see esp. pp. 3-34, 355-370 passim . I have made a few further comments on this matter, as in the opening pages of "The Descriptive Bibliography of American Authors," Studies in Bibliography , 21 (1968), 1-24, in "The Descriptive Bibliography of Eighteenth-Century Books," in Eighteenth-Century English Books Considered by Librarians and Booksellers, Bibliographers and Collectors (1976), pp. 22-33, and in "The State of Bibliography Today," PBSA , 73 (1979), 289-304 (esp. p. 300). 4 J. D. Cowley was approaching the same point (in his chapter on "Arrangement and Headings" in Bibliographical Description and Cataloguing , 1939) when he said, "A mere collection of notes thrown together in any convenient order is not a bibliography, though it may be a sale catalogue or a finding list. Bibliography is not content with the assembling of descriptions, but endeavours to relate one with another. . . . In other words it must tell a story" (p. 179). 5 One cannot even say that it should be presented in chronological order, for effective works of history and biography have followed other plans. 6 I trust it is clear that I am talking about the selection and arrangement of material, not about the specific form for recording a given detail, once chosen. There is good reason, for instance, to follow in general the standard formulary for signature collation, as codified by Bowers in the Principles , rather than to invent a new system of one's own. Procedures for recording particular details are tools of writing; I am speaking here of the arrangement of blocks of material that have been recorded using these tools. On the choice of details to record and the degree of accuracy to be employed in recording them, see my "Tolerances in Bibliographical Description," Library , 5th ser., 23 (1968), 1-12. 7 A. W. Pollard, writing in 1909 on "The Arrangement of Bibliographies" ( Library , 2nd ser., 10, 168-187), stated this point forcefully: "To make a good bibliography of any subject (even if the goodness be confined to the arrangement, without critical notes) postulates a very intimate knowledge of that subject in all its parts" (p. 168). Later in the same passage he emphasized the point: "the best bibliographies will always be made . . . by the people who are steeped in a subject and the literature of it" (p. 169). Although Pollard's essay is primarily concerned with subject checklists, it includes several statements—like these—equally applicable to descriptive bibliographies. The most thoughtful successor to Pollard as a commentator on enumerative lists is D. W. Krummel; see his chapter on "Organization" in his forthcoming book on bibliographic lists. 8 Bowers, in the Principles , takes the same view: "No rigid rules for the arrangement of material in printed bibliographies can be laid down," he says. "Each author will offer distinct problems to be solved on the basis of the material itself" (p. 382). He also points out that "One of the most difficult problems facing the writer of a bibliography is the decision about the precise arrangement he will employ" (p. 383). Donald Gallup similarly says, on the "question of arrangement" (which "should be as simple and logical as possible"), "Every bibliographer will of course run into problems that are to some degree unique with the author he has chosen" ( On Contemporary Bibliography with Particular Reference to Ezra Pound [1970], p. 26). 9 My comments below refer specifically to author bibliographies; but many of them apply also to other descriptive bibliographies, such as those recording the output of printing and publishing firms. 10 How a division into sections is determined—or whether there are to be sections at all—is taken up below. 11 This annalistic approach is favored by Rolf E. Du Rietz in "Thoughts on Author Bibliography," Text , 1 (1974), 203-216 (see p. 209). It was also preferred by Cowley (see note 4 above), p. 183. 12 Pollard in 1909 (see note 7 above) expressed his strong disapproval of this "hybrid" approach (p. 178). But half a century later W. W. Greg was able to say, in the fourth volume of his A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration (1959), a work in which plays are entered chronologically, "It was of course axiomatic in such a work as this that all editions of each piece should be grouped together"; "the procedure finally adopted," he added, "was to list all plays individually in the order of printing of their first extant editions" (p. xxiii). 13 See Bowers, Principles , pp. 37-123, 371-426; and G. T. Tanselle, "The Bibliographical Concepts of Issue and State ," PBSA , 69 (1975), 17-66. 14 One attempt at such revision is James B. Meriwether and Joseph Katz, "A Redefinition of 'Issue,'" Proof , 2 (1972), 61-70. My criticism of their effort appears in the article cited in note 13 above. 15 This phrase is meant to include such pieces as the products of private presses; the point is not whether they were placed on public sale but that they may be considered "published" when they left their printers' hands. 16 It is a publishing decision that causes, for example, 2000 copies of an edition to be printed in two printings of 1000 copies each rather than in a single press run. 17 Presumably only the main entry would receive a number, however, and thus the scheme of reference numbering does represent one approach at the expense of the other; but the basic purpose of reference numbering is to point to the physical location of material, not to indicate its classification. (See part III below.) 18 Some classification schemes—such as those often used in libraries—have a single unambiguous arrangement as their purpose; but such an ordering can be achieved only by making some arbitrary decisions about the location to be assigned to certain items. Bibliographical classification, on the other hand, is not primarily intended to suggest a physical arrangement (though any specific classification plan to some extent does so) but rather to furnish a theoretical structure for thinking about certain kinds of historical relationships. 19 That subedition does not specify the set of plates is suggested by Bowers: "When the original plates of a book, or extra sets of plates, are sold or leased by the publisher to another, and a new impression is struck off under this second publisher's imprint, we are forced to consider that a sub-edition to the parent has been constituted" (p. 389). From the point of view of publishing history, the publisher's imprint may be the dominant fact; but whether the impression with the second publisher's imprint was printed from the original, or a second, set of plates is of significance in printing history and textual study. 20 "The Bibliographical Concept of Plating ," SB , 36 (1983), 252-266. West employed this approach in his bibliography of William Styron (1977). In both the bibliography and the article he credits Joseph Katz with the idea, and in the article he further acknowledges David Farmer. William W. Kelly, in his 1964 bibliography of Ellen Glasgow, had previously grouped impressions into "plate sets" (see pp. 14-17, 36-38, 79-82). 21 With the prefix "sub-", suggesting subordination, it is hard to see how subedition could be taken to imply "that type has been reset," simply because "edition" involves resetting. Rather, a term subordinate to edition but yet containing the word "edition," and thus encompassing the possibility of separate impressions, seems ideal to stand for discrete groups of impressions within an edition. 22 He does, however, mention the possibility that another level, "shootings," should also be taken into account, since more than one set of offset plates can be made from the same photographic shooting (p. 266). 23 If a bibliographer, he continues, "suspects that replating has occurred but cannot prove it, he should use the four basic terms and record his suspicions in a note." 24 Subedition cannot, however, be limited to such readily recognizable differences. If, for instance, a firm distributes a whole impression, or a series of impressions, of an edition originally published by a different firm and if (as might happen in book-club distribution) it does not alter the imprint or call attention to itself through a series title, the result is nevertheless a subedition. 25 That the bibliographer is concerned with published objects is further reflected in the fact that chronological order (when it is adopted) usually means the order of publication, not of composition. 26 Cf. G. T. Tanselle, "The Description of Non-Letterpress Material in Books," SB , 35 (1982), 1-42. 27 It seems, from entry A3.I.b.1 in West's Styron bibliography, that the name of the Book Find Club does not appear in copies of this impression—which is therefore an example of a subedition not immediately recognizable as such (see note 24 above). 28 A further occasion for mixing publishers together would be the situation in which more than one publisher used a single set of plates, a situation that does not arise in this Styron example. If it did, the name of the publisher would have to be associated with the impression, not with the plating as in the outline above (which follows West.) 29 Traditionally the term subedition is not applied to the impressions of the originating publisher, from which all the other "subsidiary" groups of impressions must ultimately derive. Logically, however, when an edition (as the totality of all the impressions from a single act of typographic composition) is divided into subeditions, that first division, like any other group of impressions linked by publishing auspices, would have to be considered a subedition as well. 30 Obviously this problem reaches significant proportions only when two or more countries with well-developed publishing industries use the same language. It is, therefore, of great importance in the bibliographical and textual study of works written in English. 31 States need not be brought into the discussion, for they are variations in parts of books and do not refer to books as wholes. Any states within an issue or an impression must naturally be taken up within the entries for those issues or impressions; a state cannot be given an entry of its own, for it does not refer to a published entity. See the definition of state in PBSA , 69 (1975), 65-66, and my comments on the relation of state to ideal copy in "The Concept of Ideal Copy ," SB , 33 (1980), 18-53 (esp. pp. 29-30). 32 This information would presumably be retrievable in any case from the index—where one would normally expect to turn for similar references to particular printers. The necessity of a thorough index—containing all personal and firm names as well as the titles of all works—goes without saying. 33 I have made further comments along the same lines in the fourth section of "The Bibliographical Concepts of Issue and State " (see note 13 above), pp. 56-65, which includes discussion of the relation of this approach to that of Bowers in the Principles . 34 Arranging whole subeditions by country under each edition would serve little purpose, unless there were no transatlantic issues of any of the impressions and no other editions of the same work. One could similarly argue that ordering whole editions of a given work by country of origin would be of limited utility if any of those editions included impressions published in a different country. 35 After reference numbers are assigned to entries, such cross references can be made more explicit by adding the relevant entry numbers. 36 That is, any separately published work or group of works. 37 There are exceptions, of course, as in William W. Kelly's bibliography of Ellen Glasgow (1964) and Edwin T. Bowden's bibliography of James Thurber (1968), in which the record of periodical contributions precedes that of contributions to books. 38 Roy Stokes, in his second revision (1967) of Arundell Esdaile's A Student's Manual of Bibliography (1931)—which from the beginning has had a chapter on "The Arrangement of Bibliographies"—cites and accepts unquestioningly the Soho division of material into categories: he asserts that "the physical nature of the material dictates certain aspects of the arrangement" (p. 285) and claims that the difference in treatment reflects "the varying importance of different kinds of material" (p. 284). Cf. his chapter on arrangement in The Function of Bibliography (1969), esp. p. 126. 39 On periodicals and anthologies, see G. T. Tanselle, "Non-Firsts," in Collectible Books: Some New Paths , ed. Jean Peters (1979), pp. 1-31 (esp. pp. 20-26). 40 In contrast, Greg, in his pre-Restoration bibliography (see note 12 above), enters the appearances of plays in collections in the same chronological sequence with plays printed separately ("since the object was to collect the whole of the textual evidence concerning each play"). 41 There are other possibilities, of course. One could, for instance, extend the chronological principle further and deal with each new typesetting under the year in which it appeared, thus splitting up the treatment of different editions of the same piece. (On the annalistic approach, see part I above.) 42 Sometimes it is helpful to provide in a separate section a record of the collected editions of an author's works, so long as individual volume-length works are also treated at the appropriate places in the main section. See, for example, the handling of this matter in Joel Myerson's bibliography of Emerson (1982). 43 That is, in a volume other than one composed entirely of the author's own collected pieces—which would obviously be described in the section recording the author's books. 44 The textual importance of periodical appearances—in particular, the various appearances of syndicated newspaper pieces (and the different editions of the newspapers in which they appeared)—is made clear in Fredson Bowers's "Four Faces of Bibliography," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada , 10 (1971), 33-45 (esp. pp. 34-38). 45 This point is also made (in a somewhat different way) by James L. W. West III in "'Section B' and the Bibliographer," forthcoming in Analytical &amp; Enumerative Bibliography . 46 In their bibliography of Hart Crane (1972), Joseph Schwartz and Robert C. Schweik divide "Works Not Published Separately" into "Poetry," "Prose," and "Letters," with periodicals as well as books included under each heading. (The order of the entries in these sections is alphabetical by the title of the work, and the entries include reference to the later printings of each work.) 47 "Degressive Bibliography," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , 9 (1906-9), 53-65. The way the idea is now applied, however, is often quite different from what Madan had in mind. 48 See Fredson Bowers's thoughtful treatment in "Bibliography Revisited," Library , 5th ser., 24 (1969), 89-128 (reprinted in his Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing [1975], pp. 151-195). (His discussion includes comments on a series of letters on "The Degressive Principle" in the Times Literary Supplement on 4 and 11 August and 1 and 22 September 1966 [pp. 716, 732, 781, 884].) 49 These questions have occasionally—but not often enough—been asked before. R. J. Roberts makes a forceful statement on this subject in his review of George Lilley's bibliography (1974) of J. M. Murry ( Book Collector , 25 [1976], 117-118): "One of the logical flaws of bibliographical presentation in the 'Soho' tradition was that the full range of descriptive techniques was applied to anything that appeared separately in its own covers—an obvious concession to bibliophilic interests—while something which appeared in a periodical, though of equal importance textually . . . only received check-list treatment." 50 Such bibliographies, with their organizing emphasis on publications rather than authors, would be analogous to bibliographies of the output of printing and publishing firms. (Whereas descriptions in such bibliographies would naturally include full listings of contents, the extended physical description of periodicals and authologies in author bibliographies could not be expected in many cases to include detailed records of contents.) 51 Bowers effectively expresses this position in the Principles : "From the point of view of a descriptive bibliography which should be concerned with books as material objects as well as with the literary, textual, and publishing history of an author, the tenth impression may be as important as the first; and the details of its physical appearance, contents, and the number of copies printed are just as interesting. . . . Subsequent editions are all a part of the life history of an author and his books" (pp. 379-380). Cf. G. T. Tanselle, "Non-Firsts" (note 39 above) and "Bibliographers and the Library," Library Trends , 25 (1976-77), 745-762 (esp. pp. 757-759). 52 This system still occurs, as in the recent (1982) Soho Bibliography of Jane Austen by David Gilson. 53 He also indicated states with subscript figures (e.g., "A8.1.b 2 "). Since state refers to a part of a book and since copies of an impression or issue may contain different mixtures of states of individual sheets, one may question whether states should be the subject of separate entries and hence whether entry numbers for them are required. (See note 31 above.) Of course, whether states can be the subject of separate entries is a different question from whether it may be convenient to have a shorthand means for referring to copies containing particular states. 54 "A System of Bibliographical Reference Numbering," PBSA , 69 (1975), 67-74. 55 This practice introduces some uncertainty into the reference, since the item with which it is simultaneous is not specified; there is also a potential ambiguity when more than one set of simultaneous editions or issues exist. 56 Which he says that Joseph Katz created and allowed him to use first (p. xxxii). 57 As Patricia C. Willis and Clive E. Driver point out in more detail in their criticism of this aspect of Abbott's proposal; see their "Bibliographical Numbering and Marianne Moore," PBSA , 70 (1976), 261-263. (They do not, however, question the idea that a system of reference numbering "should accurately represent the history of a text.") Actually the nature of the reference numbering is irrelevant to Abbott's suggestion, since any kind of numbers could be joined with plus and equals signs to signify the presence or absence of revision in the items referred to. 58 In Computers and Early Books (1974), pp. 95-99, and revised in Fingerprint Newsletter , No. 1 (1981), where a fingerprint is defined as "four groups of two pairs of symbols taken from the last and penultimate lines of four specified pages, one pair of symbols per line, taken from each bibliographical unit" (p. 9). 59 A distinction already blurred enough in library cataloguing practice. See my comments in "Descriptive Bibliography and Library Cataloguing," SB , 30 (1977), 1-56 (reprinted in Selected Studies in Bibliography [1979], pp. 37-92), and in "The Concept of Ideal Copy " (note 31 above), pp. 47-53. 60 One cannot exaggerate the importance of this section of a bibliographical description. A record of copies examined, with defects noted, makes clear the specific body of evidence on which the bibliographical account is based. 61 In Joel Myerson's bibliography of Emerson (1982), section A occupies 537 out of 802 pages. 62 Indeed, most of the proposed schemes for bibliographical reference numbering are based on this fact, even if they favor a consistent function for a prefixed letter, since they posit more elaborate numbers for sections of a bibliography involving fuller descriptions. 63 A statement in words (often including still more information, such as the name of the publisher of a subedition) would of course also appear in the heading of each entry. 64 If entry numbers were assigned to issues, it would be hard to avoid adding lower-case letters to the impression numbers; but the whole designation would then be cumbersome enough to raise doubts about its value. Sometimes one might feel that entry numbers did not need to be given to issues: under the entry for an impression, there could simply be subheadings in words for issues (and the index would then not distinguish issues, or would include issue indicators in words). 65 Or, if the number of editions is too large, using numbers (following periods) for that function also. (There is no reason why the use of prefixed letters could not be limited to the later sections.) An example of the use of letters for a category that includes more than 26 members occurs in Donald Gallup's revised bibliography of Ezra Pound (1983), where references "E2za" through "E2zi" follow "E2z"; one could argue that references on the order of "E2.27" would be neater and more convenient (or, since section E has only seven subdivisions, perhaps "Eb27"; or yet again, simply "F27").</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Ranking of Variants in the Analysis of Moderately Contaminated Manuscript Traditions by Harold Love</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Editors of post-mediaeval English literature are not very often required, in the absence of an authorial holograph or authoritative edition, to reconstruct texts from a profusion of non-authorial copyings. When they do, as in the instances of Donne, Rochester and the authors of late seventeenth-century libertine verse and "state poems," they will naturally try to adapt the methods developed by classical and biblical scholars to deal with the problems that arise, but will not always find them as clarified or thought-through as would be desirable. 1 One reason for this may well be that editors of classical texts, dealing as a rule with thoroughly contaminated textual traditions which may, in any case, lead only to the conjectures of some Byzantine or Hellenistic editor or to an archetype that was already seriously deficient, have rightly placed their main emphasis on the reconstruction of the author's text through philological and historical means —reserving the genealogical method for situations where its conclusions would be more or less open and shut. 2 Biblical scholarship faces much the same problem multiplied several hundredfold due to the enormous number of surviving sources and the complexity of their interrelationships, and, as a result, is reduced to dealing with broad groups or families of manuscripts without much fine tracing of individual lines of descent. In dealing with traditions such as that of Rochester, however, the editors have every right to feel that they should be able to make sense of the genealogical relationships—even when faced with groups of twenty or more manuscripts. Far from extending over centuries or millennia, the copying of the sources was probably concentrated within a decade or two. It was performed by scribes and compositors who spoke a common dialect of the English tongue, into which the editor can acquire more insight than would be the case with texts in a dead language. 3 There is a good deal of incidental information surviving about the circumstances of copying. 4 Finally, these were not sacred texts or high literature but topical poems written out currente calamo for immediate consumption, with the consequences that variation abounds and that the tradition is less likely to have been corrupted by the drawing of readings from more than one exemplar, though there may have been a fairly high incidence of memorial contamination. Yet the problems clearly remain considerable. David Vieth, the first scholar to attempt to create a text of Rochester from the full range of the surviving sources (which he himself had been responsible for charting) 5 , was, according to his own account, able to make only limited use of the genealogical method and relied in the establishment of his text on an adaptation of the "best manuscript" theory. 6 The present article grew from a wish to discover whether, despite Vieth's scepticism, it might be possible to present plausible stemmata for Rochester's longer poems. 7 The innovations in method proposed have been developed solely with that end in view and will not necessarily apply in other areas of textual scholarship, though it is hoped they will be found to have some wider applicability. The approach in general involves an insistence on the historicity of the act of transmission which has been unfashionable in recent years, and which departs, perhaps unwisely, from the principle argued for by Vinton Dearing that the concern of the editor should be with the text considered as a logical construct rather than with the manuscript as carrier of the readings. 8 The distinction in itself is an important one which may be grasped most easily if we consider a manuscript which is a copy of a source, A, being corrected from a manuscript descended from a source, B, belonging to a different branch of the textual tradition, so as to remove all the substantive readings which were characteristic of A. If we assume that the deleted readings are rendered illegible, it is fair to say that the text of that manuscript, in so far as this is defined by substantives alone, 9 now belongs to the branch of the tradition represented by B, although it remains a historical fact that the majority of the words inscribed on its pages—those in which it did not vary from either A or B—had descended by a physical act of copying from A. When editors construct a stemma, they will normally see their aim as that of producing a diagrammatic representation of the logical relationships of the groupings of variant readings that characterise the sources, not a family tree of copyings which would show the paths by which the majority of readings in each instance, whether variant or invariant, were actually transmitted from page to page. So, to return to the earlier example, our manuscript would have to be included in a logical stemma as a descendant of B, even if the editor had firm external or non-substantive evidence for its having been initially copied from A. There is, of course, no objection to this procedure as long as there is no confusion in the minds of editors or their readers over what is taking place. Indeed, it is often much more serviceable to the inquiry in hand than a strict family tree of sources would be. But dangers can nonetheless arise if editors allow themselves to lose sight completely of the nexus between the text and its carrier. 10 If the study of variation is, from one point of view, an exercise in the manipulation of symbols according to the principles of mathematical logic, it is equally the study of a certain kind of human behaviour—that of the scribe, professional or amateur, in the act of copying. The importance of habituating oneself to think in terms of the genealogies of manuscripts as well as of the class-relationships of texts is simply that the significance as evidence of a variant in any kind of textual inquiry must lie ultimately in the processes of thought (or non-thought) which have led to its coming into existence, its further transmission and possibly its disappearance. Modern English-language editorial practice admits the validity of such criteria, but insists that they should be reserved until the stage when the editor has established the primary pattern of relationships between his texts and begins the search for evidence of the direction of variation in order to locate the position of the ancestor. 11 My own contention is that the consideration of scribal motivation is relevant to every stage of textual reasoning and that to ignore it is to assent to the proposition that all cases of variation are of equal value as evidence for the relationship of texts—a proposition which may, indeed, be an unavoidable rule of procedure in certain specialised studies of textual data, but which is in itself an absurdity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The editor encountering a tradition of the kind described must begin by finding solutions to two pressing problems of technique. In the first place, although the logic of textual analysis, as presented in handy form in Greg's The Calculus of Variants , 12 is crystal clear, the task of applying that logic to a manuscript tradition of any complexity, and containing even a moderate number of irregular agreements, can involve a daunting amount of calculation and record-keeping. Dearing, Froger and others have devised computer-based methods for performing the purely mechanical part of the task—though the problem still remains of ensuring that the data to be analysed is put into machine-readable form without distortion. 13 The second problem is that, as we have just seen, the variant readings which are the raw materials of logical analysis will not themselves necessarily progress through the tradition in logical ways. An error which would otherwise have been characteristic of a particular branch of the tradition might be corrected or (less fatally) miscorrected by a scribe. The same variant may arise independently in two different parts of the tradition. Readings characteristic of one branch may be imported into another as the result of memorial contamination or, in extreme cases, of an editing process in which readings from exemplars representing two or more separate lines of descent are combined eclectically into a single "conflated" text. Any of these happenings is likely to lead to an incorrect judgement about the place of manuscripts within the tradition as a whole or the number of intermediaries intervening between one manuscript and another. Seeing that a significant percentage of anomalous agreements seems to be present in every "real life" textual situation, the editor must be prepared to find this the most testing and frustrating stage of his labours. Whereas problems of scale and volume can be dealt with satisfactorily by the computer, it has yet to be shown conclusively (which is to say empirically) that purely quantitative methods can deal with the problem of irregular agreement. 14 Scholars faced with large and intractable textual traditions have naturally wished to devise methods by which vast bodies of data could be presented simply as a list of groupings of sigla and the task of reconciling these with each other and ascertaining the status of any anomalies performed entirely by a computer program. An algorithm described by Dearing in his Principles and Practice of Textual Analysis is the most elaborate attempt of this kind to date to appear in print, though others are known to have been attempted privately. While it is easy to scoff at such ambitions as a twentieth-century counterpart of squaring the circle (and there are certainly enormous temptations to recursive and tautological reasoning) the fact remains that it is only by such means that any hopes can be entertained of reaching a solution to the textual histories of the New Testament, the major church fathers, and such widely copied poets as Dante, Virgil and Chaucer. The drawback of such enterprises, however, is that the editor has to work with one arm tied behind his back. Large-scale computer-based data sorts allow no opportunity for the detailed ranking and precoding of the data. Moreover, once a variation has been reduced to a string of symbols divided by group delimiters it has to be regarded as possessing exactly the same evidential value as any other variation with the result that cases of irregular agreement must be reconciled by quantitative not qualitative means. Quantitative means should not be sneered at simply because they are quantitative. The powerful software packages used by social scientists for the statistical analysis of questionnaire and interview data have a considerable, and so far largely untested, value for textual scholars. But they cannot give better than a statistically plausible answer to the central questions—what is the location of the ancestor and how are the other texts derived from it—and there are many situations in which this will be a disastrously wrong answer. Older approaches to textual criticism, partly from necessity but partly also from intellectual preference, took a view that was exactly the other way round. Accepting that variations differ greatly in their reliability as evidence for the family relationships of sources, they exercised editorial judgement to select those variations most likely to indicate the true state of affairs, rejected the others, and constructed their stemmas on the basis of what they learned from the favoured few. 15 It is true that the method was sometimes grossly abused by lazy or careless scholars, but there is still much to be said for it providing two conditions are met. The first of these is that adequate, reasoned and consistent criteria for selection are employed. The second is that decisions made on the basis of a selection of the evidence are found to hold good in a general way when referred back to the whole body of data, or at least to a random sample of it. It is my aim in what follows to outline one form in which such a method can be applied and to suggest that at the present stage of our experience it still offers many advantages over purely quantitative methods for dealing with problems of irregular agreement in moderately contaminated traditions. It will be necessary before proceeding to present a more detailed summary of the circumstances under which variation may arise during the copying of texts. Least under the control of the scribe is physical damage to the exemplar that removes words or makes them illegible. Variation may also arise from inadequacies in the script of the exemplar by which one word may be read as another or provoke a desperate emendation. The extent to which this takes place will be influenced by the scribe's ability as a decipherer of difficult hands and, perhaps more vitally, by his preparedness to devote time and care to the analysis of letter forms. A third class of changes may be described as misreadings due to incorrect perception on the part of the scribe or a failure to proofread the transcript against the exemplar. This would include eyeskips between two occurrences of a word, dittography, reversals of order, and errors arising from incorrect anticipation—all these categories of error having been carefully anatomised by classical scholars. 16 Of a slightly different nature are substitutions, whether voluntary or involuntary, of the scribe's habits of grammar and expression for those of the original. 17 These would not always be seen by the scribe as comprising errors: in some cases they might even be regarded as part of his professional duty. Next come what can be described as editing activities: the emendation of real or imagined errors, the incorporation of readings from other, supposedly better sources, and the replacement of the unfamiliar by the familiar, even if the unfamiliar is perfectly satisfactory—for textual transmission has its own perverse kind of Gresham's Law by which the majority reading will inexorably extend its empire simply by possessing the "rightness" of familiarity. Scribal "improvement" of the original is another matter still—this may have an aesthetic justification or a moral one and covers the suppression or alteration of readings which to the best of the scribe's knowledge were intended by the author, as well as outright interpolation. Bearing these things in mind, let us consider the position of an editor faced with a tradition containing seven manuscripts, cited under the sigla A to G, who encounters a variation in the form ABDE:CFG, or as it would be written in Greg's notation—Σ:CFG. These two groups should ideally represent (1) an independent and self-contained subfamily within the overall tradition, having its own exclusive common ancestor, and (2) a residual body of texts descended without variation from the archetype—which is which need not for the moment concern us. This ancestor of the sub-family, in turn, may either be one of the manuscripts listed or a lost intermediary (further patterns of variation would need to be consulted in order to determine this). And yet the assumption that the two groups of sigla are genetically significant is not one that the editor is able to make on the basis of a single instance, or even, in some cases, on the basis of a repeated occurrence of the same variation. Before he can judge the value of the variation and the kind of weight that can be placed on it as evidence, he will need to consider two further questions: whether each of the groups indicated is likely to be a true group in genealogical terms and whether it is likely to be a whole group. 18 It will be self-evident that such a question can not be answered from a consideration of symbols alone: it requires a close consideration of the actual variant in its context of meaning, supplemented by a sound understanding of the habits of scribes. The idea of a "whole" group is necessary to allow for the fact that some variants are inherently less stable than others. Restricting ourselves for the moment to what Greg called type-2 variations, involving two groups of texts only, each of which contains at least two members, let us consider the situation of a scribe encountering some glaringly obvious mistake in grammar or metre in his exemplar. While it is a sad fact of life that scribes will often apply superb calligraphical skills to the transcription of arrant nonsense, such a reading would be at constant risk of being altered into something more plausible. Assuming that, in the present case, our scribe succeeded in restoring the reading of the original, his transcript, and those of its descendants which managed to transmit the reading without any further alteration, would, as far as this particular variation was concerned, appear to be prior rather than posterior to their ancestor containing the error. At the same time, the sources that preserved the error would cease to indicate the full membership of the body of manuscripts descended from that ancestor —in other words they would no longer indicate a whole group. The same kind of risk is run by any unique or minority reading—however plausible—occupying a prominent position in a much-copied poem. Here our Gresham's Law would apply again—and a scribe who had encountered the more widely represented reading might substitute it for the alternative simply because, being familiar, it seemed "better." In discussing the related notion of a "true group" it is necessary to remind ourselves again that our concern for the moment is only with individual variants considered in isolation. Whether or not any given agreement, say CFG, indicates a whole group, that group will be "true" as long as each of its members genuinely belongs to the same sub-family as defined by succession of copying from the source in which the variant originated or from the archetype. However, in cases where an identical variant was introduced spontaneously and independently by scribes working from different exemplars or had arisen from contamination, the receiver group would be a false one in that one of its members was not a descendant of the text in which the variant originated. In this last case the variation would be a false group that contained a whole group though it is easily possible to imagine circumstances that would lead to the genesis of groups that were false without containing a whole group. A third distinction that needs to be made is that between variants that are enabled by their nature to extend beyond their genealogical bounds and those which are not enabled. If a scribe should feel dissatisfaction with a reading in his exemplar and consult either another manuscript or his memory for an alternative, he will obviously be ready to accept any good, or at least plausible, alternative he might encounter. On the other hand, if the alternative was itself of a dubious nature, there would be little point in making a substitution. 19 Moreover, if he knows of no alternative, but attempts a conjectural emendation, his guess is much more likely to coincide with an alternative good reading than an alternative bad one (remembering that we are not at present considering variations with more than one alternative). Plausible readings must therefore be regarded as potentially mobile while bad readings will normally remain stationary. Familiarity may have a similar effect. As has already been indicated, the scribe will tend to regard the variant with which he is personally familiar as the "right" one, and, statistically speaking, this is more likely to be the variant that is better represented among the surviving sources. 20 If the variant concerned was both familiar and obviously more plausible than that with which the scribe was confronted in his exemplar, the pressure to make the substitution would be almost overwhelming, even in cases when it was the less plausible minority reading, as lectio difficilior , which was authorial or offered the best evidence for the authorial intention. If both variants were equally plausible, and there was in consequence no incentive for the scribe encountering either one separately to search for an alternative in a second source, the less common reading would only be likely to supplant the more common if it happened fortuitously to be that with which the scribe was already familiar. A consequence of these distinctions is that the agreement in an obviously wrong, and therefore "stationary," variant of a group of manuscripts when the alternative is obviously better is a very powerful argument—perhaps the most powerful of all—for them forming a true group. It would be unlikely, however, for them to form a whole group, both because of the existence of a better alternative and because a scribe unaware of the alternative might still arrive at it through conjectural emendation. 21 The importance of these considerations for the editor is that they suggest ways in which certain kinds of variation, or even certain kinds of variants taken in isolation, might be regarded as more likely or less likely to produce reliable evidence about the trueness or wholeness of groups. The following list offers a ranking of classes of variant according to the likelihood of their providing reliable evidence of "bibliographical" descent. It must be understood that some of the assumptions made rest on no firmer foundation than common sense, and that common sense is sometimes contradicted by what emerges from the patient analysis of large bodies of empirical data. It is to be hoped therefore that the validity of these assumptions can be tested for each of the major historical manuscript traditions by a statistical study of the causes of variation in situations where it is still possible to compare a copy with its exemplar, and equally that the activity of transcription can be studied under laboratory conditions using the methodology of present-day experimental psychology. A further limitation is that it assumes that scribes, whether characterised as "alert" or "careless," will behave in a reasonably consistent way and come to reasonably rational conclusions about the problems posed by their exemplars, an assumption which is hard to reconcile with the many peculiar situations encountered in the sources. Nonetheless, the criteria listed are offered as the guides which in the present state of our knowledge, and on the basis of my own experience as an editor of seventeenth-century texts, seem most likely to prove fruitful. As earlier, only Greg's type-2 variations are admitted for formal consideration though the method obviously has implications for the evaluation both of type-1 variations and of complex variations (Dearing's types 3 and 4). 22 The basic distinctions that require to be made are as follows: (1) whether a reading encountered by a scribe in his exemplar would appear to him to be plausible (P), suspicious (S) or an obvious error (E) (2) whether, in the event of a scribe having knowledge of the alternative, a variant would be likely to be regarded as good by comparison (G), indifferent (I), or obviously inferior, i.e. bad (B) (3) whether a variant can be described as obtrusive (O), in the sense of being prominent and likely to draw attention to itself, or unobtrusive (U) (4) whether a variant might be considered vulnerable to reversal or further alteration under the influence of scribal linguistic and spelling preferences or palaeographical factors (V). Using this terminology, we can describe the following classes of variant and/or variation, each possessing a different degree of trustworthiness as an indicator of genetic relationships. PIU A clear substantive variant which is plausible in its context and to all appearances could have been intended by the author, which is indifferent by comparison with the alternative reading, yet which is not obtrusive enough to encourage memorial contamination from the alternative in cases where that was better represented and therefore more familiar. A variant of this kind is likely to indicate both a whole group and a true group. PIO A clear plausible substantive variant not noticeably better than the alternative, but one that is obtrusive enough in the poem to have run a definite risk of memorial replacement. Criteria of obtrusiveness would need to be derived afresh for every new work or tradition studied. In a religious text, for instance, it might be the theologically charged word that required to be so defined whereas in verse the position of the word in the stanza might be relevant. 23 Consideration would also have to be given to the likelihood of the scribe having encountered the work being copied on a previous occasion or of having access to a second source: with the Rochester manuscripts, I believe that possibility to have been quite a high one, especially where the professional writers of the large miscellanies were concerned. Variants of this kind are still likely to indicate both a true and a whole group, but not so reliably as those of the previous class. If the variant is relatively infrequent by comparison with the alternative, and there is no reason for believing that this was not the case in the tradition as a whole (including non-surviving as well as surviving sources), the likelihood of its representing a whole group would be correspondingly diminished but the likelihood of its representing a true group correspondingly enhanced. PGU, PGO A clear plausible substantive variant but clearly better than the alternative. Readings so classified—and especially the obtrusive subclass—would be likely to travel into texts belonging genealogically to the alternative group in cases where the scribe was aware of both alternatives. In such instances, the texts containing the good reading would constitute a false group which, however, contained a whole group, since the bad reading would not, under normal circumstances, ever be substituted for the good one. SIU, SIO, SBU, SBO Situations where the variant reading is suspicious but not an obvious error. A careless scribe would simply copy the reading, but an alert one might be tempted to emend or to consult another source. Such variants would be quite likely to define a true group, as they would be unlikely to travel to other branches of the tradition, but could not be relied on to define a whole group, especially when the alternative was obviously better. E Glaring and obvious errors that only a careless or desperate scribe would be prepared to let pass and that would never be called on to repair a suspect reading in another text. Where there is no danger of independent error, such variants would probably be the most reliable of all as indicators of a true group but would have little reliability as indicators of a whole group. 24 V A variant which, while still characterisable as substantive, would be vulnerable to change either as the result of an individual copyist's linguistic or spelling preferences or for palaeographical reasons. Variants in the first category would be likely to lie behind many forms of purely dialectical variation, many variations in grammatical function words, most variations in which alterations to meaning are brought about by variations in punctuation or small changes to spelling, and most variations in the wording of material that might be regarded as ancillary to the text proper such as titles, inscriptions and stage directions. The second category would include all variations involving words such as "the," "that," "which," and "when," which were frequently written as contractions, and most variations between singular and plural forms, many of which appear to arise from the misreading of final "s" as a decorative flourish or of a decorative flourish as final "s." (This and other points of ambiguity might well be particularly critical in the handwriting of particular scribes.) The problem with such readings is not simply that they are highly prone to further variation but that they are, more specifically, highly prone to reversal—often without any conscious intention on the part of the copyists. The vulnerability would therefore apply to both alternatives in the variation. Variations of this kind are the least likely to indicate either a true group or a whole group. On the other hand, if one has been able to establish a stemma on the basis of more reliable classes of variants, one would expect the V variations to show a predominant conformity to the genetic patterns. 25 Accidental variants, i.e. those which are purely matters of spelling or punctuation, are so unpredictable in the pre-1800 period as to have little value as evidence for the descent of texts. Editors, as a rule, do not even bother to record them. It should not be overlooked, however, that variant spellings of proper names may sometimes be of value (a repeated glaring error in the spelling of a common name could be admissable as evidence of the constitution of a true group) and that a conformity in the distribution of variant spellings of the same words throughout a manuscript can provide persuasive evidence of relationship and is, indeed, one of the few reliable methods by which we can trace the descent of substantively invariant readings within a tradition and thus distinguish genealogical from purely textual affinities. 26</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The difficulties confronting the "bibliographical" editor who insists on trying to determine the relationship of manuscripts as opposed to texts have been eloquently summarised by Dearing: Finally, the bibliographer, seeking to relate means (transmitters) genealogically, can never fully answer the antinomian objection that he may be wrong by rule. A record whose immediate independent descendants do not record different states of its text can vanish without a trace. Agreements can result from normal copying, from conflation, from emendation, from independent errors (as for instance making the same eyeskip twice), or just by accident. Who is to say what combination of circumstances produced the agreements or failed to produce the differences the bibliographer analyzes? What check is there on his estimate of the most probable circumstances? The best reply he can make is that his procedure is rational and that the objection is fundamentally antirational and subversive of good order. 27 There is much weight to these objections, as there was in the advice given to Columbus on the quayside that he must expect to endure hunger, thirst, hardship, mutiny, shipwreck, disorientation and an ever present risk of toppling over the edge of the world. But Columbus, being unfashionable enough to believe that truth might be sought through the study of the physically and historically actual as well as from speculative symmetries, proceeded with his voyage, and editors are, in my view, best equipped to deal with problems arising from irregular agreement when they consider them not merely as logical anomalies (though this is also their duty) but as a challenge to understand the operations of a particular human mind engaged in the act of copying at a particular moment in history. For, as Vieth has pointedly stated, "the bases of textual criticism are just sufficiently mathematical to tempt the critic to set up for a scientist, and just sufficiently nonmathematical to make this temptation an insidious trap." 28 The method of ranking variants which has just been proposed is designed to admit a bibliographical perspective into the preparatory stage of stemma-building by proposing criteria for selecting those variants most likely to have remained stable in transmission and for eliminating those which are likely to be unreliable as evidence for the descent of manuscripts. The criteria in their present form are admittedly crude and may in some instances still produce misleading data—which would be all the more misleading for its having been selected "by rule." They certainly do not relieve the editor of the need for an unceasing alertness towards all the possibilities inherent in all his evidence and the obligation to test all available techniques for making sense of it. It must also be conceded that the method can only be effective when variants are relatively abundant: there would be no point in restricting one's attention to a selection of the more "reliable" variations when this would not provide sufficient evidence to permit the full determination of the stemma. The first step towards the construction of a stemma is to distinguish between those variants which stand at the conclusion of lines of relationship, and which are called terminal, and those which lie on lines or at the intersection of lines and which are known as intermediaries. Terminal texts are revealed by their possessing unique readings which show in the form of what Greg called type-1 variations, e.g. ACDEF:B. The final determination of intermediary status rests on more subtle tests, but a text which contains no unique readings is at least a possible intermediary. There are, however, two situations in which the editor may be misled. The first is where a text is in fact terminal but does not reveal this through the possession of an unique reading. The second is where a text which is genealogically speaking an intermediary possesses unique readings which were not transmitted to its descendant or descendants and which therefore show as type-1 variations. A simple situation in which this might happen would be when a carelessly written manuscript introduced errors of an obvious kind, some of which were removed conjecturally by the scribe of a copy. It is therefore clear that readings of a kind that would be prone to such reversal (and especially those in categories E and V) are of lower value as evidence for either terminal or intermediary status than more inherently stable readings. The issues are simpler in this case than in the later stages of stemma construction in that the editor is only concerned with the question of whether the scribe of one of the manuscripts containing the majority reading could have had the odd-manuscript-out in front of him as his exemplar but felt impelled to emend, either because of familiarity with the alternative reading or because the reading as it stood was obviously unsatisfactory. When anything in the nature of the minority variant suggests that such a reaction might have been possible (obtrusiveness in the first case, suspiciousness or outright badness in the second), the editor should be cautious about relying on its unsupported evidence in determining terminal status. A simple way of handling this problem when considering a large number of sources is to give each unique reading a reliability rating on a scale from nought to two, where 2 indicates a variant, which, in the light of the criteria suggested earlier, would seem to be exceptionally reliable as an indication of terminal status, 1 a variant which is reasonably plausible and not too obtrusive, but no doubt, like all unique or at least rare readings (for it is possible that the singleton variant may have existed in a number of now lost manuscripts), must have been in some measure of danger from memorial contamination, and o a variant that must be considered to have run a real danger of reversal at the hands of an alert scribe. The precise setting of these values will need to be a matter for the editor concerned; however the aim should be a situation in which a single 2-class variant with support from one other of lower status, three 1-class variants or five or more o-class variants should provide acceptable evidence for terminal status and any text with less support be reserved for reconsideration when evidence is available from the larger groupings. The next and most challenging stage in stemma-building is the determination of the distributional relationships implied by the type-2 and complex variants. Here the problem is to ensure that the variants chosen as the basis for analysis are, as far as can be determined by purely notional methods, those most likely to give an accurate indication of the underlying genetic groups. 29 In order to ensure this, the following procedure is suggested. To begin with, the editor works through each of his variant readings, studies it carefully in relationship to its context and then assigns it to one or another of the suggested classifications (PIO, SBU, E etc.). In doing so he is in the position of a bidder submitting sealed bids in advance of an auction at which he is also to be the auctioneer, and there may at a later stage be a strong temptation to change the terms of the bid in order to accommodate an emerging pattern of agreement. 30 This, however, would be to defeat one major advantage of the method which is to remove the danger of rationalisation after the event by demanding an assessment of variants at a stage before an overall pattern of relationship has begun to suggest itself. So that the method can be used with as much integrity as possible, and so that evidence can be assembled to permit an assessment of its validity as a method, it is suggested that the judgments should be made first independently and then in consultation by at least two scholars, and that later reassessments should only be made with the agreement of both. It is, of course, possible at this stage that agreement over the precise status of a variant might not be possible. In particular, there are situations where a PIU-type variant, which would theoretically have the highest reliability ranking, may be hard to distinguish from a slightly firmer-than-normal V-type variant. In this case, the variant could be given a double ranking and classified initially either at the higher or the lower ranking depending on whether variants were in short supply or not. If it was necessary to use it for the first stage of calculation, it should be watched carefully, and could be reclassified if it was observed to be setting up otherwise insoluble patterns. In other cases, however, editors should be prepared to stand by their preliminary evaluation except in situations when a reclassification would be justified by clear considerations which had previously been overlooked, or when a process of reasoning back from an emerging stemma to prior classifications could be justified in Humphrey Palmer's terms as being spiral rather than merely circular. 31 Fundamental to the use of qualitative methods in textual criticism is the recognition of the point at which, in each particular case, they cease to yield valid answers. To attempt to apply them beyond that point is to devalue not only the editorial enterprise but also the methods. It must also be recognised that the use of such methods is not a substitute for the disciplined and intricate logical procedures described by theorists such as Palmer and Dearing (assuming, of course, that the editor is convinced of their validity as procedures) but a way of supplementing, sharpening, and, where necessary, correcting them. The selection of which classes of variants to use in the construction of the hypothetical non-directional stemma will depend on the numbers of variations available within each class. The ideal situation would be one in which PIU variants only required to be considered; but, as it is also vital that the variants selected should permit as full as possible a determination of the stemma, it will often be necessary to content oneself with eliminating those classes most likely to contain positively misleading evidence about the composition of genetic whole groups, namely E and V (though E-variations will still, as explained earlier, provide a valuable control on assessments of the truth of groups). If a shortage of higher-ranking variants means that all except the lowest-ranking groups have to be included, the number of inconsistent agreements requiring to be located by formal means may be dauntingly high. However, if some formal technique of resolving inconsistencies, such as Dearing 'ring-breaking' routine, is employed, it should be regarded as absolutely essential that its determinations should be checked at every stage against the qualitative judgements established during the initial process of classification, and, in cases where there was any conflict between the two, a fresh assessment of the contextual evidence undertaken. As an additional guide, I would recommend that every textual scholar should adorn his study with two historical illustrations —the first of the Charge of the Light Brigade as a reminder of the fatal consequences of entry into the wrong branch of a multi-branched fork, and the second of the last stand of the Old Guard at Waterloo as a testimony to the inadvisability of breaking rings without the very best of reasons. At the third stage of stemma-building, when directional evidence is required, it will of course be sought for through the entire body of variations, bearing in mind that those classified as indifferent under the present terminology may still be directional. The danger in eliminating variants from consideration because they are of a type that may lead to irregular agreement is that one can easily at the same time suppress variations containing valid and unique evidence of some particular aspect of the genetic relationship. In order to compensate for this, the establishment of a hypothetical stemma should be followed by a testing of its power to make sense of the whole body of variations, including those rejected from the original investigation because of their possible unreliability. A precise methodology for this cannot at present be proposed, but the general rule that should be borne in mind is that, if we have determined the actual pattern of descent, the predominant body of agreements should be in accordance with it and those that are not should be explicable by means of one or other of the principles considered earlier. The presence of a certain level of completely unaccountable variation in a "living" text (as Quentin has used the term) 32 has perhaps to be allowed for, at least among the lower-grade variants; but for a stemma proposed for a tradition of any complexity to receive assent, it must, at the very least, explain. The assumption behind the present study has been that in dealing with moderately contaminated traditions it should be possible to determine bibliographical genealogies by applying Greg's methods of analysis to variants selected on a prima facie basis as unlikely by their nature to be involved in irregular agreements. The criteria proposed are in some ways a refinement on Greg's own words of advice for dealing with what he terms "correctional conflation": What usually happens is that collation and "correction" are confined to some of the more striking variants. This will show itself on analysis either by the sporadic appearance of anomalous groupings, or by those involving the more important variants consistently pointing in one direction, and those involving the minor variants consistently in another. . . . It may be added that, where conflation is suspected, the value of variants as an indication of ancestry is in inverse proportion to their intrinsic importance. To the herd of dull commonplace readings we must look for the genetic source of the text, to the more interesting and striking for the source of the contamination (p. 57). It is necessary to bear in mind, however, that the efficacy of the method will decline as the number of irregular agreements rises and that, for the radically conflated traditions with which Dearing and Okken are principally concerned, such a stemma, even if determinable, might not be of much help in restoring the readings of the archetype.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Examples of critical editions of seventeenth-century English poets drawing on extensive collations of manuscript sources are the Oxford English Texts editions of Donne, edited by Helen Gardner and Wesley Milgate, and of Suckling, edited by Thomas Clayton and L. A. Beaurline, and Poems on Affairs of State: Augustan Satirical Verse, 1660-1714 , gen. ed. George de Forest Lord, 7 vols. (1963-75). The Complete Poems of John Wilmot Earl of Rochester , ed. David M. Vieth (1968), though compiled on critical principles, is without an apparatus criticus . For a detailed account with supporting evidence of an experienced editor's conclusions about the problems of one such text, see L. A. Beaurline, "An Editorial Experiment: Suckling's A Sessions of the Poets," Studies in Bibliography , 16 (1963), 43-60. 2 For the circumstances of transmission of classical literature, see L. D. Reynolds and N. G. Wilson, Scribes and Scholars: A Guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature (2nd ed., 1974) and E. J. Kenny, The Classical Text (1974). Lambertus Okken in his 1970 Rijksuniversiteit te Utrecht doctoral thesis, Ein Beitrag zur Entwirrung einer kontaminierten Manuskripttradition: Studien zur Überlieferung von Hartmanns von Aue "Iwein ," p. 8, points out that Karl Lachmann, the founder of modern textual criticism, never in fact published a stemma and inquires "Hatte der grosse Philologe im Umgang mit kontaminierten Traditionen, etwa mit den Überlieferungen von Wolframs von Eschenbach Werken, gelernt, das die Kenntnis der Handschriftengenealogie gewöhnlich keinen praktischen Wert hat?" 3 An exception to the common dialect would be the University of Edinburgh Library MS. DC. 1.3 of poems by Rochester and his contemporaries, the text of which contains a detectable infusion of Scotticisms. 4 Much information on this topic will be found scattered through David M. Vieth, Attribution in Restoration Poetry: A Study of Rochester's "Poems" of 1680 (1963). For an exceptionally revealing account of the genesis of a particular group of manuscripts, see W. J. Cameron's "A Late Seventeenth-Century Scriptorium," Renaissance and Modern Studies , 7 (1963), 25-52 and "Transmission of the Texts" in Poems on Affairs of State , V, 528-540. 5 In his Attribution in Restoration Poetry , his edition, with Bror Danielsson, of The Gyldenstolpe Miscellany of Poems by John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, and other Restoration Authors (Stockholm: Almqvist and Wiksell, 1967), and his edition of the Complete Poems . 6 See Complete Poems , pp. xlvi-lii. Vieth prefaces the account of his procedures with the dry remark: "Some aspects of textual criticism raise surprisingly philosophical questions, in this instance whether the universe (not to mention the human mind) is fundamentally rational" (p. xlvii). The genealogical, historical and philological methods are employed to create a "tentative reconstructed text" of the poem. The early text "having the least departures from the tentative text" is then chosen as copy-text and its readings accepted "unless there is substantial reason to substitute a reading from other texts" (pp. l-li). In practice, Vieth appears to have let a number of minor substantive readings stand which are unlikely to have been those of the archetype. 7 As this enterprise is still in progress, I can not guarantee that my conclusions will not be identical with Vieth's. 8 See Vinton A. Dearing, Principles and Practice of Textual Analysis (1974), pp. 14-20 and passim. Dearing holds that the establishment of the genealogy of "transmitters" (e.g. manuscripts) is the province of bibliography, not textual analysis which is described as "a logic engine, like a computer" (p. 58). "Carrier" is to be preferred to Dearing's "transmitter" as terminal texts are receivers only and do not transmit. 9 It is possible in some instances to establish relationships between texts on the basis of accidental features, such as the distribution of variant spellings, or physical features such as line-lengths or the number of lines per page. For a summary of Cameron's important discoveries concerning scribal accidentals, see Poems on Affairs of State , V, 529. 10 Some of these are spelled out by Humphrey Palmer in The Logic of Gospel Criticism (1968), pp. 93-94. The additional point should perhaps be made that, even in a strictly "bibliographical" stemma, the inferential intermediaries remain inferential, that is to say logical abstractions, and cannot be relied upon to correspond in their assumed readings to any single historically existing manuscript. 11 The editorial heritage of Lachmann encouraged editors to fuse the two processes of the assessment of direction and the linking-up of the stemma; however editors of English literary texts since the time of Greg have agreed in not proceeding to consider directional evidence until the linkages between texts have been established on a purely distributional, non-directional basis. The present study, while arguing that contextual as well as purely formal arguments should be admissible at every stage of textual reasoning, accepts the validity of the two-stage model of stemma-building. For objections to the Lachmannian method, which is still accepted on the authority of Maas by many present-day classicists and mediaevalists, see Dearing, pp. 5-11, 15-16 and 54-56 and Palmer, pp. 76-80. Palmer concludes (p. 92) that Lachmann's method "is quicker—when it works!" but that it depends "on finding errors certain to the critic and incorrigible by copyists"—a consummation more often devoutly wished than practically experienced. For a defence of the method against its critics, see Kenny, p. 137. 12 Walter W. Greg (1927). Dearing's much more detailed study refines in many valuable particulars on Greg's techniques, definitions and terminologies but should not be used without reference to Michael Weitzman's review in Vetus Testamentum , 27 (1977), 225-235. I would like to thank Dr. Weitzman for pointing out an error in the reasoning of an earlier version of the present paper. 13 See Dearing, pp. 215-236 and Dom J. Froger, La Critique des Textes et son Automatisation (Paris: Dunod, 1968). Earlier work by Dearing is discussed briefly in my "Computers and Literary Editing: Achievements and Prospects" in The Computer in Literary and Linguistic Research , ed. R. A. Wisbey (1971), pp. 47-56. Gunter Kochendörfer and Bernd Schirok, Maschinelle Textrekonstruction , Göppinger Arbeiten zur Germanistik nr. 185 (Göppingen: Alfred Kümmerle, 1976) includes a valuable bibliography of work in a number of languages relating to this field (pp. 176-179). 14 As the aim of textual analysis is to restore the readings of the archetype, formal systems and algorithms claiming to do this should be tested on texts chosen at random from a tradition created by supervised copying in as close as devisable an approximation to the conditions experienced by professional scribes of the past and with the solution withheld from the experimenter until after he has submitted his conclusions. If such a system can not produce a correct solution to texts whose descent can be verified, it can hardly be trusted to produce correct results for historical traditions where the conclusions can not be verified. 15 In the Lachmannian tradition, the "favoured few" are readings regarded as having clear directional implications but not, in the judgment of the editor, being readily corrigible by copyists of the period concerned. These are in turn divided into (1) separative errors which indicate that the manuscript containing them can not be the ancestor of one in which they are correct (cf. Maas, pp. 42-47) and conjunctive errors defined by Palmer as "common to two manuscripts but not a third, and such that the reading of the third could not be due to correction by the copyist" (p. 243). 16 A summary of the more common kinds of scribal error will be found in Reynolds and Wilson, pp. 200-212. For a more systematic treatment, see James Willis, Latin Textual Criticism (1972), pp. 47-188. Weitzman (p. 226) draws attention to important material to be found in J. Stoll, "Zur Psychologie der Schreibfehler," Fortschritte der Psychologie , 2 (1913), pp. 1-133. 17 Cameron's experience of this kind of variation in his "scriptorium" manuscripts led him to suggest that " all texts are in fact conflated texts—a conflation of the exemplar and a structure of linguistic expectations that is present in the mind of the scribe" ( Poems on Affairs of State , V, 529). 18 By a "whole group" I understand a whole "true" group as defined below. Greg's use of "true" to describe variational groups containing more than one member seems to proceed from nothing more than an aesthetic disinclination to speak of a "group" with only one member (cf. Dearing, p. 10) and should be disregarded. 19 Cf. Maas, p. 8: "obvious corruptions, particularly lacunae , may easily be transmitted in the direct line but are hardly ever transferred by contamination." Against this, however, must be placed Greg's principle (p. 20 n.) that "the easier it is to explain how an error arose, the less valid the assumption that it only arose once." 20 Assuming, of course, that the distribution of a variant among surviving sources corresponds in a general way with the distribution of the variant in the whole body of sources available at the time the scribe made the copy. This may not always have been the case: a Bowdlerised version of a satire may, for instance, have stood a better chance of survival than an obscene one. If a text was available in printed form, each copy in circulation would need to be counted as a separate source for purposes of such a calculation. 21 The editor should consider the possibility whether the overlapping of two or more possibly incomplete groups defined by gross and easily corrigible errors might not indicate a fractured whole group. 22 Dearing, p. 57, revising Greg's terminology. Constantine Kooznetzoff, on the other hand, though he does not assert this as a general principle, finds in his "A Genealogical Analysis of the 'Tristan' Fragment, Ms. 2280," AUMLA, 54 (November 1980), 194, that the type-2 variants "providing they are consistent, afford all the evidence necessary for deducing manuscript relationships." The complex variants are declared "genetically non-evidential" on the grounds that they contain "conscious scribal emendation" (p. 197). 23 A test for obtrusive readings in a short poem would be to find a pretext to make someone transcribe it several times, and then, after a few days interval, ask him to write down as much as he could still remember. The readings correctly given would be the "obtrusive" ones. 24 The only at all likely situations where such a variant would not indicate a true group would be (1) when it had been called on to fill a lacuna in a majority-group manuscript by a scribe with too imperfect a knowledge of the language or content of what he was copying to realise its uselessness or who felt that any reading was better than none (2) when the identical gross error was made during separate copyings by the same scribe (a quite conceivable happening in a scriptorium situation such as that described by Cameron) or by separate scribes (rather less likely unless some aspect of the original reading or a particular exemplar had created an exceptionally high risk of error). 25 These points are discussed in greater detail in my "The Text of 'Timon. A Satyr'," Bulletin of the Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand , 6 (1982), 113-140. 26 For an example of the application of this technique, see my "The Texts of Southerne's The Spartan Dame," Bulletin of the Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand , 1 (1970-1), 54-59. 27 Dearing, p. 19. 28 Review of Dearing's Manual of Textual Analysis, JEGP , 59 (1960), 555. Housman in "The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism" sees the subject matter of the discipline as "not rigid and constant, like lines and numbers, but fluid and variable; namely the frailties and aberrations of the human mind, and of its insubordinate servants, the human fingers" ( Selected Prose , ed. John Carter [1961], p. 132.) Dearing, p. ix contains a brief retort to Housman. 29 Cf. Greg, p. 13. 30 Dearing warns rightly (p. 55) that if the textual analyst "lets the form of his family tree influence his analysis of the directional variation, he reasons in a circle." 31 Palmer, pp. 51-52, 80. The problems of circular reasoning in textual criticism are similar in their nature to that of the "hermeneutic circle" in critical interpretation as discussed by a number of contributors to the Autumn 1978 issue (X. i) of New Literary History . Palmer's metaphor with its attractively Yeatsian overtones hardly offers a procedural solution, but indicates that the methodological plight of historical scholarship is not as desperate as it is sometimes made out to be. 32 Henri Quentin, Essais de Critique Textuelle (Paris, 1926), p. 43, quoted in translation by Palmer, p. 80.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Identification of Paper without Watermarks: The Example of Pope's Dunciad by David L. Vander Meulen</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Various radiographic and photographic processes for reproducing watermarks have in the past two decades made the identification of paper more precise than earlier researchers ever considered possible. But while those methods work well when a watermark is in fact present and when enough of it is visible to be identifiable, there exists no systematic way of describing and differentiating the vast quantities of paper without watermarks. That paper appears in many forms: it may be an entire unwatermarked sheet, or it may be only a single leaf—from a marked or unmarked sheet—used for a cancel, title page, errata list, plate, or other special section. Because a watermark is normally centered in one of the halves of a sheet of paper, 50% of the gatherings produced by half-sheet imposition in formats like the octavo usually have no watermark. On still other occasions watermarks are absent because a zealous binder has trimmed into oblivion a mark appearing at the edge of a leaf. On the basis of my study of editions of Alexander Pope's Dunciad from 1728 through 1751, I should like to consider features which can be used to distinguish varieties of unmarked paper. Those methods work for watermarked sheets as well, with numerous advantages: they provide a way of describing the entire sheet, not just the part where the watermark appears; they permit identification of the paper when only a partial watermark is present; and they provide a means of recording paper details when watermark reproduction facilities are not available or their cost prohibitive. In the pages that follow I shall also suggest ways that these characteristics might be recorded and, by means of examples from The Dunciad , consider some of the applications of this information.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Common to all paper of the period is the presence of chain lines, with measurable spaces between them. Bibliographers have long noted variation in the width of those spaces, but no one has pursued the implications of those differences. In his Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927), Ronald McKerrow merely observes that chains occur "from three-quarters of an inch to an inch apart" (p. 100); he seems to have in mind a variation between different kinds of paper. In the same vein, John Carter notes in ABC for Book-Collectors (1952) that chain spaces "vary in width between different makes" (p. 50); he too seems to suggest that those differences occur between paper varieties rather than within a single sheet. Fredson Bowers' Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949) advocates recording the measurement between chain lines (p. 446), but it does so specifically for nineteenth-and twentieth-century books, for which laid paper would usually be produced by machine and in which the features of the paper, including those distances, would tend to be more uniform. In this as in so many other areas of paper study, Allan Stevenson was the first to suggest more specific applications of the evidence. One of the tests he recommends for distinguishing twin watermarks is a comparison of the chain spaces touched by each mark. 1 In the examples which follow his article he cites numerous cases where the spacing at the mark in one mould differs from that in another or where the chain spaces near the watermark differ significantly from the average openings in the rest of the sheet. In the text of the article, however, he is equivocal about the usefulness of recording chain line spaces. He confidently states, "The student soon learns the advantage of measuring the chain-spaces as part of the routine of examination," but he then notes, "In measuring large watermarks, internal chains may be ignored, for chain-spaces (after 1500) tend to average 20 mm." (pp. 68-69). Stevenson's attention, moreover, is directed to the chain lines around watermarks, not to those appearing elsewhere in the sheet. In another article, in which he shows how chain line indentations can help to determine conjugacy and cancellation, he again says of the lines, "Their regularity can be observed, their spaces measured." 2 But in the subsequent discussion he refers only in passing to "chain extensions," implying that agreement in the pattern of chain lines on two leaves can indicate whether the leaves are conjugate. Again he does not pursue his important insights by contemplating the usefulness of actual measurements. Those who have heeded Stevenson's call to scrutinize chain spaces have followed him in devoting their attention to the spaces around watermarks and in considering the other spaces of a sheet to be the same as each other. Stevenson himself continues those emphases in later writings, particularly in his examinations of the Missale speciale and of early English paper made by John Tate. 3 The latter study is particularly interesting from that point of view, for although he again speaks in terms of averages and focuses on chain space differences adjacent to the watermarks, he also records additional spaces—but without calling attention to the variations they reveal (p. 27). Subsequent summaries of paper evidence based on Stevenson's work reflect his emphases. G. Thomas Tanselle's authoritative survey of paper study urges a recording of chain spaces, though his sample descriptions all present evenly spaced chain lines and concentrate on those around watermarks. 4 Likewise, Philip Gaskell suggestively refers to "chain-lines differently spaced" but later specifies "the spacing . . . of the chain-lines . . . in the vicinity of the watermark." 5 It is a measure of the significance of those earlier studies that they are able to provoke insights beyond their authors' original intents. Although the ultimate goal of determining paper varieties and moulds has sometimes been overshadowed by the intermediate goal of identifying watermarks, the methods developed for analyzing watermarks can be extended to serve the greater end by being applied to the vast quantity of paper which contains no such marks. The measurement of the spaces between chain lines for an entire sheet of paper is probably the most fruitful extension of the earlier methods. Unlike watermarks, these lines are present in every leaf of paper manufactured before the introduction of wove paper in the later eighteenth century, and they can almost invariably be found in page margins, unobscured by type. Most important for identification, the spaces between the various chains in the paper I have examined are seldom the same. Equal chain spaces across a sheet are in fact rare enough to be a distinguishing quality of a variety of paper. In the paper of this period the openings usually vary by as much as 10% and sometimes even 20% within a given sheet, or by as much as 3 to 6 mm. Patterns become evident when the measurements are arranged in a series; these patterns serve to identify different paper moulds. To measure the chain spaces I use a thin metric ruler. While theoretical considerations support the use of the metric system, 6 practical ones also do: this system provides units which are small enough to discriminate properly but remain easy to manipulate; and because chain lines are typically one millimeter thick, measurements to half a millimeter can easily be made according to a binary system with chain lines sorted according to whether they fall more on a millimeter marking on the ruler or between such marks. Large formats serve the best, for they are the least interrupted by gutters, which obscure chains, and outer margins, from which some of the chain lines may have been trimmed. But sometimes when constructing a chain space model it is useful to take readings from several formats. When the same paper is used for an octavo and duodecimo, as, for instance, in the first 1728 Dunciads , the relative positions of the pages on the sheet will be different. As a result, one format reveals chains and spacings that are hidden or cut off in the other. There are some circumstances under which the measurements of a particular chain space may vary for the same variety of paper: the sheets may have shrunk at different rates; a chain line may wander from adjacent ones as it runs from one end of the sheet to the other, and the different examples may have been measured at different parts of the sheet; the lines may have moved gradually during the life of the mould; or the measurements themselves may have been slightly inaccurate. The measurements ordinarily do not deviate by more than a millimeter per opening, however, and even when they do vary this much the pattern of wide and narrow chain spaces generally remains the same. To help insure that a series is representative for a sheet, it is best to measure the leaves at the point that is most likely to provide an average reading, i.e. at the center of the sheet. That is also the usual location of watermarks, and measurements taken there when watermarks are present both will fit with previously published reports of chain spaces around watermarks and will yield measurements for future researchers who wish to cite only that information. For a folio, that means measuring across the center of the page; for a quarto, down the gutter; for an octavo, across the top of the leaf; and so on. The leaves one selects to measure will be based on standard imposition diagrams for the period; Gaskell's New Introduction to Bibliography provides handy illustrations of the usual formats. The measurements of leaves containing watermarks, however, should always be recorded. A researcher may also wish to measure other leaves or different places on the leaves to test the amount of variation between a pair of chain lines from the top to bottom of a sheet. Because the chains do not always lie square with the printing on the page, it is also useful to scan the unmeasured leaves of a gathering to see whether any reveal a chain—and thus the datum of an additional chain space measurement—that might have been trimmed off in other leaves. A record of the chain spaces of every leaf of a sheet would provide a means of detecting cancels, whose chain patterns would almost certainly differ from the dominant one, but because of the time required a person may wish to test only previously suspected cancels this way. Because the array of numbers produced by the measurements is potentially confusing, especially when consulted after the actual book is many days and many miles away, it is important to have a systematic way of recording the initial data. For formats with vertical chains, I place a ruler whose scale begins at the tip into the gutter of the book and note every point at which a chain crosses. Because of the tightness of most bindings the distance from the inside chain to the fold at the spine cannot be measured precisely anyway, so a slight bit of wear at the end of the ruler does not matter. On the other hand, it is useful to get as accurate a measure as possible, and hence the advantage of a thin ruler, which will slip farther into the gutter than a thick one will. The actual width of the leaf, which usually will have been recorded for the general description of paper but otherwise should be noted specially, and the amount of the leaf visible along the ruler together enable the bibliographer to infer the number of chain lines concealed between the innermost chains of conjugate leaves. That number eventually is important for constructing the chain space model of the entire sheet. Pushing the ruler snugly—but without undue force—into the gutter also helps to steady it during the measuring. Recording the positions of the chain lines seriatim across the rule seems preferable to measuring individually each chain space, for it is less confusing and therefore less prone to error. Such a series also provides a context for the individual measurements, one which can later help to explain errors which have crept into the record. The procedure for formats with horizontal chains is essentially the same, though the measurement is then from the head to the foot of the leaf, or, usually, from the center toward the outside edge of the sheet. In this case the tip of the ruler lies flush with the edge of the page and the ruler itself usually can lie lengthwise in the gutter. Consistently measuring from the same side of the leaf reduces the confusion that can easily result from attempting too many processes simultaneously; I use the recto. That policy holds for watermarks too, even if that means reading and sketching them backwards. I make a record of the mould side of each leaf examined and, if necessary, make adjustments to the placement of the watermark when putting the information into final form. Meanwhile I have the information in a consistent format and can spot differences more readily. Once I have measured each sheet, I convert the series of readings into actual chain space distances and arrange them on a page according to the way they would have lain in the original sheet. If the two leaves of a sheet in folio have been measured, for instance, the measurements from the gutter of the first leaf might be: 18 28 27 29 27.5 28 20 19 12, and in the second: 5 26.5 28 28 28 27 29 27 10. When the readings are combined to form the complete pattern, those of one leaf (here, the first) would be reversed so that the measurements at the gutter would be contiguous: 12 19 20 28 27.5 29 27 28 (18) (5) 26.5 28 28 28 27 29 27 10 To align properly the corresponding chain spaces from different sheets, it is best to list the openings from the back fold outward, orienting the measurements around that point. Although leaves will not be trimmed at the inner margin, they may well be at the outer ones, with a potential effect on the number of chain spaces that are recorded. Once the measurements from different sheets have been arrayed, they can be grouped. For each group, a composite reading can be established and the model of an "ideal" sheet—and in many cases a nearly exact determination of the sheet length—can be formed for each paper variety which appears. Because of the potential variations mentioned earlier, slight differences may appear among the individual sheets which seem to be the same variety; the basic pattern of wider and narrower spaces usually does not vary. In establishing the model, however, I do not include examples which vary by 1.5 mm. or more for a particular chain space. One of the challenges in grouping like sheets is to get all of the sheets positioned in the same direction. The mould side does not matter for paper without watermarks; merely turning the sheet top-over-bottom would change the sheet from the mould or felt side to the other one. But turning the sheet end-over-end reverses the pattern of spaces. Watermarks, tranchefiles, or any of the other distinguishing characteristics to be discussed later can serve as useful points of reference. Watermarks are a special boon at this stage. By determining how the watermark reads from the mould side and by positioning the mark so that the top and bottom of the mark itself are properly oriented, one can situate the watermark on the sheet and often at once discriminate paper varieties. Although any procedure which works well is acceptable for initially recording data, it is advantageous that when formally presenting the findings a bibliographer avoid the idiosyncratic and work within a system that is already understood. For that reason, and because it works well, I have adapted Allan Stevenson's method of recording watermark positions to the presentation of chain space models for entire sheets. 7 The essence of Stevenson's method is to separate chain spaces by vertical lines and to enclose watermark widths within brackets. Thus, the notation 28 | 3 [24 | 22] 5.5 | 27 describes a watermark 46 mm. wide (millimeters being the standard unit of measure), 3 mm. from the chain on the left and 5.5 mm. from the one on the right; the adjacent chain spaces are 28 and 27 mm. To those elements I have added parentheses, ellipsis points, and a mark to indicate deckle edges. When a number in parentheses occurs amid a series of chain space measurements, it is an estimate of the width of an opening; such numbers are used when the opening occurs in the gutter or at the trimmed edge of a sheet and can not be measured directly. Parenthetical numbers at the end of a series represent the greatest width found for that opening when the sheet has been cut between chain lines. Ellipsis points at the end of a series mean that what is presented is only a part of a sheet—usually either a half-sheet or, as with readings from a duodecimo, one-third or two-thirds of a sheet. The percentage sign [%] indicates a deckle edge; I have chosen it because it has no other special use in bibliography. When no examples of a deckle occur but tranchefiles or other evidence imply the original edge of the sheet, that symbol occurs in parentheses. Because in most formats the watermark spreads over several leaves, a record of the width and position of both the top and bottom halves is often an aid to identifying paper in which only one part of the watermark is present. The chain space model can simply be made two-tiered at that point. Thus, one of the varieties of paper with the eagle watermark in the fine-paper copies of the 1729 quarto Dunciad Variorum can be described in this way: (%) (9) 30 29.5 27.5 31 28 29 28.5 29 29 (29) 29.5 30 28.5 4.5 [24.5 7.5 [21.5 26] 4 20] 10 29 28 19.5 20 (13) (%) Some special chain lines, the tranchefiles, have features not characteristic of other chains and therefore provide a second group of variables to distinguish unwatermarked papers. A tranchefile is usually described as an extra wire between the final chain wire and the frame of the mould, and hence also as the extra chain line such a wire forms at the end of the sheet. Tranchefiles look like other chain lines, except that they are spaced closer than usual to other chains and, because the tranchefile wire typically does not have a supporting wooden rib, they lack the customary bar shadows. While tranchefiles often occur at both ends of a sheet, sometimes a tranchefile appears only at one end, and sometimes at neither. Kenneth Povey and I. J. C. Foster provide examples of each of these varieties of "close chain-lines" in their discussion of paper with turned chain lines. 8 The number of ends of a sheet which have a tranchefile, then, serves as one identifying feature of a sheet. The pattern of the chain spaces around the tranchefiles also varies. In one common pattern, the outermost chain (or tranchefile) line is usually 5 to 10 mm. from the edge of the sheet. A space of about half the usual distance between chain lines then follows before the first chain line of the normal pattern in the sheet. In the Dunciad comprising volume V of the small-paper octavo Works of Pope in 1751, for instance, typical chain spaces at the end of a sheet are: % 5 | 13.5 | 27 | 27.5 . . . . In most other cases where tranchefiles are identifiable in Dunciads , there are instead two narrow spaces between chain lines. A common paper variety in the first 1728 edition thus measures: % 11 | 20 | 21 | 25.5 | 26 . . . . When there is a pair of narrow chain spaces, only the penultimate chain seems technically a tranchefile, since the outermost chain often has the customary bar shadow. Such a chain line is not part of the normal pattern of chains in the sheet, however, since the combined distance from it to the tranchefile and from the tranchefile to the next chain is significantly more than the usual distance between two chains. Regardless of the source of the chain line, the number of narrow chain spaces, as well as the actual width of those spaces, provides additional ways of differentiating paper varieties. Although several writers have made use of the presence of tranchefiles, Stevenson has again provided leadership by using the absence of tranchefiles, as well as the actual width of the spaces adjacent to tranchefiles, as bibliographical evidence. More recently, Annemie Gilbert and Sylvia Ransom have observed that the patterns of tranchefiles and their adjacent spaces do indeed differ in eighteenth-century papers. 9 A third way of identifying unmarked paper again involves chain lines. Much of the paper in the Dunciads of the 1720s through the 1740s has double chains: about 6 mm. to one side of a chain is a second one, so that the chain lines in a leaf look like sets of railroad tracks. In one of the few acknowledgments of this feature, Edward Heawood points out that such "subsidiary chain-lines" as well as countermarks in the corner of the sheet (he emphasizes the initials CM over T, a combination which is frequently found in copies of The Dunciad ) are characteristic of early eighteenth-century paper from Genoa. W. A. Churchill illustrates the double-chain pattern in paper used from 1599 through 1744; he too cites Genoa as its source. 10 When double chains occur, the shadows caused by the wooden ribs beneath the mould may be centered on each of the chains, just as in single-chain paper, or they may fall between the chains, as they do in all examples from The Dunciad . When a shadow lies between two chains, one of the chains is more clearly visible than the other. Even when the second chain is nearly invisible, the shadow to one side of the primary chain can be seen. Double chain lines can thus provide distinctions by whether they are present and by whether the rib or bar shadows center on the chains, but they can also do so according to whether uncentered shadows appear to the left or to the right of the primary chain. For those arbitrary directions to be meaningful, there needs to be some way of orienting sheets of paper consistently. For watermarked sheets, the standard sheet position for reading watermarks (from the mould side, with the top of the mark toward the top of the sheet) is appropriate. Unmarked sheets also have helpful features. Often they have tranchefiles at only one end; for ease of comparison, I consider such lines to be at the left edge of the sheet. Occasionally sheets may have a broken or bent chain line which can serve as a means of positioning them consistently. Other times the chain space pattern as the bibliographer has established it will serve arbitrarily to distinguish "left" and "right." Unmarked half-sheets appear especially often, for they come not only from unmarked sheets but also from the unmarked half of each watermarked sheet. In half-sheets there can be only one deckle edge parallel to the chain lines and, at most, a single set of tranchefiles. If either is present, the secondary chain can be described as being either toward or away from that edge (or, similarly, to the outside or inside of the sheet). In lieu of that specific evidence, one can usually determine from standard imposition diagrams the leaf edges which represent the outside edge of the sheet. In octavo half-sheets, for instance, the outer edge of leaves 1 and 2 will usually be at the end of the sheet. When measuring chain spaces in double-chain paper I usually have not recorded the exact position of secondary chains. My chain space models for such paper, therefore, indicate the positions of only the primary chains. One reason for the omission is that often the secondary chains are not clear enough for the precise measurement which is necessary to make meaningful a report of the distances involved. Furthermore, in the examples that I have studied, those additional measurements have not yielded significant variations beyond the ones revealed by the pattern of primary chains alone. That is not to deny, however, that in other instances such measurements could be important. I have found the "direction" of the shadows to be consistent throughout a sheet, with one class of exceptions. At the end of a sheet where a tranchefile is present and where the chain lines are parallel to the deckle edge, the chain space pattern might be: . . . 27 | 28 | 27 | 20 | 20 | 8 %. The variation is this: when the secondary chains appear to the outside (here, the right) of the main chains, the penultimate chain or tranchefile usually has no secondary chain, and the outer chain or tranchefile has a secondary chain to the inside (here, the left). A fourth identifying feature not dependent on watermarks is the density of the wire lines. Like chain lines, these marks are a useful guide because they are present in all laid paper. There has been little published consideration of the recording of information about wire lines, though Gaskell and Stevenson reveal two main approaches. Gaskell recommends trying to record the spaces between the impressions, just as with chain lines: the bibliographer should "measure the distance across a particular number of marks and . . . divide the result by that number" ( New Introduction , p. 76). Stevenson, on the other hand, quotes a writer at the turn of the century who reports the number of wire lines per inch. 11 In an important article on American paper making in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, John Bidwell shows that the ledgers of the mould-making firm N. &amp; D. Sellers do in fact describe moulds in terms of the number of wires per inch. 12 Because of the historical precedent and because of the small distance between the lines, the record seems better made in terms of density than of spacing. Eliminating the process of division both saves a step in the recording of the data and also yields more meaningful results. The difference in spacing which is created by an additional wire per inch in the common densities, for instance, is only about a tenth of a millimeter —a difference impossible to detect without special equipment. A bibliographer who wishes to compare paper at hand against the published measurement therefore either has to reconvert the published one to a reading for a larger distance or else carry out a mathematical operation upon the new measurement. It is much easier to report the number of wires per unit. I have found no problem that results from expressing the measurements for the chains and wires in slightly different terms; there is no inherent connection between the two anyway. The person who does need to know the distance from one wire to another has available the numbers to make that calculation. On the other hand, including the density fraction does not mean that the spacing distance could not be added in parentheses. The measurement should be made on the metric scale rather than in inches. Again standardization is an argument for the choice of metric, but again there is also a special practical consideration: because wire lines average about a millimeter apart, the researcher can make a quick initial estimation of the lines by seeing whether they occur more or less frequently than the marking for each millimeter on a ruler. I have found it useful to report wire lines by recording the number of lines per three centimeters (about 1.2 inches). That measure is long enough to record subtleties of spacing that a shorter one would have missed (e.g. 28/3, where wires in a single centimeter would probably be read as 9) while short enough to preserve the eyesight of the person counting. The number of lines per sample varies slightly in a sheet, but seldom by more than two. In fact, a difference of two wires per three centimeters is sometimes sufficient to distinguish paper samples. In analyzing paper in the first octavo edition of the 1729 Dunciad Variorum I was surprised to find that the paper varieties which I had identified by other means corresponded in all but one case with the division of wire lines between 24/3 and 26/3. That one exception from a book now thousands of miles away may have been the result of an inaccurate measurement and serves as a reminder of the need for vigilance even when one is confronted by the imminent closing hour of a library. While the difference in wire line frequency is thus of use to modern students, there is evidence that the eighteenth century also used it as a basis for discriminating kinds of paper. The description "fine" was normally used as an indication of quality, with the other main categories being "second" and "ordinary." 13 But in Charles Ackers' printing ledger from this period, the term several times stands in opposition to "coarse," suggesting that the words refer more specifically to the texture and perhaps the wire lines of the paper. 14 The Oxford English Dictionary specifies that when "coarse" and "fine" are contrasted in the eighteenth century, "fine" indicates delicacy: "consisting of minute particles or slender threads and filaments." In the only Dunciad in which the size of an ordinary paper and "fine" paper issue are the same but the wire lines different (the quarto Dunciad Variorum of 1729), the regular copies have wires of 24/3 while those of the special copies are 29/3. Bidwell's account of the Sellers moulds at the end of the century confirms this pattern of wire density: the wires in moulds for writing-quality paper had the thinnest wire and the greatest number of wires per inch, while moulds for printing and wrapping qualities were increasingly coarse (p. 312). Other qualities of unmarked paper also have the potential to characterize specific varieties. Some are general qualities and provide help mainly by their presence or absence. Turned chain lines, for instance, merely distinguish the paper from the more common kind, unless uncut copies are available in order also to reveal from edges whether the paper was made as a double sheet or as side-by-side sheets. The basic distinction between turned and ordinary chains can be useful, though; in a 1742 edition of The Dunciad which appeared as volume III, part ii of Pope's Works ( Griffith 579), 15 it instantly reveals which of the leaves are cancels. Various other qualities are not amenable to easy quantification or categorization. Variations in color in the leaves may be too slight to be distinguished without more elaborate measurement than a color chart provides, but they still may offer hints. In a slightly different manifestation of color, the sprinkling on the edges of at least some copies of the 1751 small-paper Dunciad has discolored at different rates according to the variety of paper on which it lies. The texture of paper is also difficult to describe. What Stevenson speculates might well be "knots from woolen underwear" in some paper does not serve as an adequate description of the paper's texture but does provide him with a clue for linking papers possessing different watermarks (" Tudor Roses ," 27). Finally, some features such as paper thickness may be quantifiable but ambiguous in their significance. Gaskell notes the possible variation of thickness within a given sheet ( New Introduction , pp. 76-77); my own checking in The Dunciad has turned up variations of as much as 100% within a single leaf. But although it is unwise to assign paper to a particular group solely on the basis of its thickness, it does seem worth-while to record the thickness, both to have available the range of measurements for particular paper and to provide the information for determining an average thickness. I have found that when the readings from different groups of what is demonstrably the same paper are averaged, the result is the same, within a tolerance of ±.001 inch or .025 mm. Although none of these paper features provide as much help in identifying paper as the four discussed earlier, they often do provide clues that the paper researcher may find valuable. The method providing the most precise identification of paper varieties, then, is that which establishes a record of the skeletal structure of a mould, the pattern of its chain lines and spaces. The procedure requires no specialized equipment, merely a ruler. In examining paper it is useful to apply as many tests as are convenient, of course, for the identity is thereby established not only more conclusively but also in many cases more easily. The various grosser differences can often help to define broader classes of paper and in the process also provide initial groupings for the more precise chain space patterns. In all attempts at identification the bibliographer is also aided by the knowledge that varieties were normally produced in multiples of two or, in the case of double moulds, four. The primary difficulty with the procedures I have been suggesting, especially the measurement of chain spaces, is not a new one to the bibliographer: they take time. The efforts can ultimately save time, of course, in facilitating the identification of paper samples. In some ways radiographs or other reproductions would be preferable for such work; several narrow strips across the direction of the chain lines could provide the necessary information and serve as paradigms against which to check other samples. Practical difficulties with such reproductions are their cost and availability. Radiographic prints from the major libraries that can provide them appear to average about $10 each. Because the libraries often have the legitimate wish to retain the original negatives for their own files, the bibliographer who wishes to have them in order to compare patterns by overlaying them often needs to pay an additional $5 per reproduction to have duplicate ones made. As a result, even a record of each paper variety in a single book such as the first octavo Dunciad of 1729, whose sixteen different half-sheets would require at least thirty-two exposures for complete coverage of a single copy, would be prohibitively expensive. Photographic reproductions are potentially cheaper, but the libraries that have the necessary books are also the ones most likely to require the work to be done by their photographic departments—at nearly the same cost as the radiographs. A researcher who wants a reproduction of each watermark design does not fare much better. A watermark appearing in an octavo is often spread over four leaves and requires four exposures for each variety, with still more if countermarks are present. Apart from other considerations, then, a bibliographer may wish to use chain space models instead of reproductions for financial reasons. There are also theoretical grounds for presenting chain space models instead of or in addition to reproductions. An obvious function of descriptive bibliography is to describe—that is, to give an account of the material at hand in words or other typographical symbols. By presenting the chain space model, the bibliographer conveys information such as measurements not immediately evident from the actual leaf or its reproduction and also provides a standard form of the data that can be more easily re-used and transmitted. Although reproductions are particularly useful supplements to verbal reports of complex designs like watermarks, they provide little additional insight into the features of chain spaces. Another problem the bibliographer must be mindful of is the temptation to force aberrant patterns of paper characteristics into the procrustean beds of established designs. Given the number of times paper is handled between its removal from the vat and its placement on the tympan, it is easy for anomalous sheets to slip into a grouping. For instance, one half-sheet gathering in one of the seventeen copies of the first octavo edition of the 1729 Dunciad that I have examined has the watermark of a horse inside a large circle. Some copies of James Bramston's The Art of Politicks produced by the same printer and same publisher the same year also have that watermark, and the lot of paper for that book may be the source of the stray sheet. What is important here is that the other half-sheet of that paper is probably unmarked and thus would prove puzzling if it were recorded in a Dunciad . Another danger in trying to fit unusual paper samples into existing models is that sometimes paper varieties may be represented by only one or two examples in a book. For instance, the sheets used for gatherings A and B of the 1743 edition of The Dunciad, in Four Books ( Foxon P796) are similar to paper used throughout the volume but do not match exactly. The bibliographer who resists the temptation to group those examples with the established ones is rewarded to find those anomalies occurring as one of the main varieties in a companion edition of Pope's Essay on Man published in February 1744.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II In considering ways in which information about paper can be used, it is possible to distinguish at least three levels of application. Initially one can merely describe and identify the material at hand. From that, one can make inferences about the process of manufacturing the book, and beyond that consider the textual implications of those physical qualities. Each step considerably widens the range of possible implications and applications of the preceding level. In what follows I shall deal with the first two stages, beginning by showing how the procedures for identifying paper actually operate in several editions of The Dunciad . The first 1728 edition was issued as both a duodecimo and an octavo ( Foxon P764-765). The same general varieties of paper were used for both impressions: the chain lines are double, and the watermark, when present, is 'BF' and lies on the right-hand half-sheet. As a reflection of the fact that both impressions were imposed in half-sheets, about half of the gatherings are unmarked. The presence or absence of watermarks provides the first means of distinguishing the papers. The watermarked ones can be divided into two groups: some of the paper has chain shadows to the right and has tranchefiles, while other paper has the shadows to the left and no tranchefiles. The marked paper with tranchefiles can be further divided according to the position of the watermark: sometimes it lies in the chain space adjoining the tranchefile space, while at other times a complete chain space lies between the one occupied by the edge of the watermark and the nearest tranchefile space. The chain space measurements of those two varieties reveal that no further subdivision is possible. Other chain space measurements show that the marked paper without tranchefiles also divides into two varieties; overall, then, there are four varieties of paper with the 'BF' watermark. Similar methods help to sort the unmarked half-sheets. Some of the paper lacks tranchefiles and has chain-line shadows away from the deckle edge. The paper that does have tranchefiles has the shadows toward that edge. Because there are no watermark positions to provide points of identification here, and because the variation in the wire line density is not great enough to be relied on, the chain spaces provide the next step of discrimination. The measurements of each class of paper fall into two groups, yielding the same number of varieties as the watermarked sections. It is extremely likely that the eight varieties of half-sheets were originally mates of each other in some combination. But at this point it is not clear whether each whole sheet had one marked and one unmarked half or whether some sheets had two marks and some none. Although some combinations can be ruled out on the basis of the shadow direction (complementary half-sheets can not both have shadows going toward the deckle edge), not all possibilities are thereby tested. One way of positing matching pairs is to examine the distribution of each variety throughout numerous copies and make tentative links between half-sheets that appear in the same sections of the book. That process yields clear patterns here, but it can not be considered conclusive. What does yield decisive evidence is a feature of the imposition patterns of the two impressions of this Dunciad . A half-sheet in octavo is either the left or right half of the original sheet and ordinarily contains half of the chain spaces (which run vertically) on that sheet. A half-sheet in duodecimo, on the other hand, is the top or bottom half of the original sheet and therefore contains part of every chain space on that sheet. One-third of a duodecimo full- or half-sheet is of course cut off, and there is little assurance that a particular cutoff will be reunited with its former companions. But that still leaves two-thirds of the original chain lines and spaces present. Because the paper varieties in both formats of The Dunciad are demonstrably the same, the chain space models for half-sheets of the octavo are effectively extended to two-thirds of a sheet when combined with the duodecimo readings. That means that chain space models from two ends of the same sheet will overlap for the center third and that the pairs of extended half-sheets can be reliably matched. The chain space models that result each have one end with tranchefiles and one without. Interestingly, those paper models match the characteristics of the paper Gaskell identifies as produced by end-to-end two-sheet moulds: "paper from pairs of such moulds will show combinations of four different examples of the watermark, not two, and it is also likely that only one of the shorter edges of each sheet will have the tranchefile and drip marks" ( New Introduction , p. 64). If this 1728 paper, probably from Italy, is from double moulds, it is a fairly early example. Gaskell cites such paper from the 1690s, probably from Holland; the earliest documentation he finds for its manufacture in England and France, however, is from 1768 and 1788 respectively. This first 1728 edition of The Dunciad proves to be a useful one, for it shows the extent to which various features of paper which are usually overlooked can help to differentiate varieties. While easily detectable characteristics define broad classes, I was able to note those differences most readily because I had before me the array of data collected from numerous copies of the works, usually in conjunction with chain space measurements. The final distinctions, however, had to rely on the time-consuming measurement of spaces. Only after the features of the varieties were ascertained could hypotheses be safely entertained about the nature of the moulds. As so often, watermarks played an equivocal role in the identification. Their position helped to distinguish the half-sheets in which they were present, but they were absent from about half of the gatherings. In addition, the portions of the initials that remained after trimming usually were too small to provide points of comparison on the marks themselves. The temptation to incorporate anomalous chain space patterns also arises here. In at least two copies of the octavo, gathering B has a countermark 'G' in the lower corner. Both of these copies are at libraries which might be outside the group that a bibliographer would be most likely to check—the National Library of Wales, and Edinburgh University. A difference in shadow direction indicates that the two examples are different. What is implicit, therefore, is that these samples have corresponding half-sheets, perhaps unmarked ones that are in the 10% or so of gatherings that I have been unable to assign with certainty. A bibliographer who would force those remaining examples into the models to which they were only approximately similar would therefore risk obscuring evidence of variant papers. Another interesting array of paper varieties occurs in the first octavo edition of The Dunciad Variorum in 1729 ( Foxon P776-780). The collation for the most common forms of the book is: 8°: A 4 (—A2, A1 + χ 2 ) B-Aa 4 Bb 4 (± Bb3) Cc-Gg 4 Hh 1. A1 is a blank and Hh 1 an errata leaf; an engraved plate of either an owl or an ass may appear as the frontispiece or may be inserted at the beginning of Book I or II in the poem. The greater part of the work, gatherings B-Bb, is printed on the same two varieties of 'S'-marked paper with double chain lines that comprise the quarto edition of the poem, which was circulating privately about a month before the octavo was first advertised. The problem of matching the correct marked half-sheets with unmarked ones again arises but here is solved by recourse to the quarto, where full sheets reveal the entire chain space sequence. The watermark 'TM' with the corner countermark 'CM' over 'T' 16 occurs in the half-sheet gatherings A and Cc-Gg. These can be subdivided into two groups according to the frequency of wire lines and the position of the watermarks. Four varieties have fine wires (33/3), and they never have the countermark and main mark in the same half-sheet. The directions of bar shadows indicate that these four varieties constitute two pairs of half-sheets, or two sheets. With only one exception in the seventeen copies checked, only this fine-wired paper is used in gathering Cc. A few scattered examples also occur in three of the other gatherings in this non-'S' section. The other sub-group, with noticeably coarser wire lines and with the watermark and countermark on the same half-sheet, occurs in two varieties with wire lines of 24/3 and two with wires of 26/3. Both of the 26/3 papers have the mark 'TM' upside down with respect to the countermark. Again the shadow directions clearly indicate which of the unmarked gatherings are the likely complements of the marked ones. Only papers with wires of 24/3 occur in Dd, and they are by far the predominant varieties in Ff and A. Ee and Gg, on the other hand, consist mainly of varieties with wires of 26/3. The cancel Bb3 and the errata leaf, which were printed together and are occasionally found conjugate, sometimes have a 'TM' watermark. On the basis of the chain-space models established for varieties of paper with that watermark, unmarked examples of these leaves can also be identified as coming from those sheets—almost invariably ones with the coarse chain lines. The same is true for the cancel leaves χ 2 , the new title page and the owl frontispiece which replaced the original title page. Sometimes that owl plate appears separately later in the volume; then too it is on 'TM' paper. The ass plate, on the other hand, is never on that paper. Sometimes portions of the watermark 'BF' appear on that plate, and sometimes a fleur-de-lis, suggesting that the paper may be the kind represented by Heawood's design 1715 (dated 1729), with one of the marks in each original half-sheet. The initials suggest a possible connection with the 'BF' paper of the 1728 editions, but a comparison of the chain spaces with the 1728 models reveals that the paper is not the same. Again, then, the features of chain and wire lines provide a means of identifying paper varieties. In a moment I shall consider some possible implications of that information. Other special leaves in 1729 editions can also be identified by recourse to chain space models. Most copies of the second octavo edition of The Dunciad ( Foxon P781) have a half-sheet of errata. It is on paper different from the rest of the book but, with the hint provided by an occasional watermark and the confirmation from other paper characteristics, it can be shown to be on the two 'TM'-marked sheets with wires of 24/3 that appear in the first octavo. 'TM' paper shows up in another place as well: the addenda leaf at the end of the 1729 quarto is printed on marked and unmarked sections of these sheets. Meanwhile, back in the second octavo edition the three cancel leaves and single-leaf errata list can be proven to be from the same paper as the rest of the book. The next example, the octavo edition of The Dunciad which appeared as volume V of Pope's small-paper Works in 1751, differs from the previous ones by having turned chain lines, single chains, and many sheets with no watermark at all. Some of the features useful in identifying paper thus are not present (though their absence is itself a distinguishing factor), and the effectiveness of the chain space measurements has been reduced because there are fewer spaces—and hence, fewer potential variations—per sheet. The presence of watermarks provides the first distinguishing feature of the paper. Because most of the gatherings in the volume are full sheets, it can be determined with reasonable certainty whether they are marked. Gatherings a-b and A-G never have a mark, while the remaining ones— π A, c-d, and H-R—usually have the initials 'RW'. One way to begin sorting the marked sheets is to classify them according to the portion of the mark that shows. The method is by no means foolproof, for the sheets might have been placed in slightly different positions on the tympan, thereby causing the printed impression—whose outline, and not the edges of the sheet itself, were used by the binder as folding guides—to vary in respect to the position of the watermark. But in the present case the watermark sections do help. Some sheets have the top of the mark showing, and others the bottom. A comparison of the chain line spacings reveals three subgroups of each kind. Double-checking the space patterns of these six groups against each other confirms that they are separate varieties. Six varieties of paper is an unusual number for sheets which, as the turned chain lines indicate, were almost certainly produced on double moulds. These sheets would be expected to occur in multiples of four: two sheets per mould, with a pair of moulds. The occasional unmarked sheets which appear in the sections of the book which are usually watermarked provide an explanation. When the chain spaces of these sheets are analyzed, they yield two patterns, bringing the total number of varieties to eight. The patterns are different from those in the marked sheets, meaning that they are not merely states of the marked ones in which the designs had come loose from the moulds. Nonetheless, these two varieties may have had marks of some sort at one time. It might also be that one pair of moulds had marks on the two sheets on one mould but no marks on the other mould, or, more likely, one marked and one unmarked sheet on each mould. The section of the volume where only unmarked sheets appear poses greater difficulties, for there are no clear distinguishing features to provide initial subgroupings. But most of them have tranchefiles at only one end of the sheet; these provide a way of orienting them for easier comparison. When the chain spaces are checked against each other, four distinct patterns emerge. It is possible that some of these varieties are the ones occurring throughout the watermarked sections, but another check of the chain spaces reveals that all are distinct. Finally, it is also necessary to consider the volume's four cancel leaves and the errata leaf (which appears in two settings), none of which is marked. Their chain spaces match none of the twelve identified varieties in the book. That lack of correspondence fits the information in the paper ledger of the book's printer William Bowyer; the paper he ordered was sufficient only for the 20½ original sheets of volume V. Cancels and errata lists are not planned before the printing of a work begins, and they were apparently machined on other paper. Thus far the second part of this essay has been concerned with ways in which the techniques discussed in the first part can be used to discriminate varieties and determine characteristics of sheets of paper. But already we have moved beyond that initial stage by considering how that information can be used in identifying special single sheets such as errata and cancel leaves and in helping to detect double moulds. In the remaining part we shall look at additional applications of the descriptions. Those uses are not exhaustive, but they do suggest the kinds of insights to which the material can lead. Paper without watermarks can be used for many of the same bibliographical purposes as that with marks, but because more of a sheet is now relevant, the potential frequency of use increases. The newly noted characteristics can provide new ways of performing old tests—such as that for conjugacy, for instance. When one leaf of a suspected pair has a type impression on only one side and the test for first forme impressions does not work or when the leaves have been pressed so smooth that neither that test nor the one for the mould side of the paper can apply, a check of the chain-space pattern, shadow direction, and wire line frequency may solve the problem. In the first 1729 octavo Dunciad , for instance, one can determine on those grounds that the owl frontispiece and cancel title page are conjugate but that the ass plate and title never are. Paper identifications can also suggest relationships between different works, even if the precise meaning of those relationships is not immediately clear. As noted earlier, two gatherings of preliminaries in The Dunciad, in Four Books in 1743 are of the same paper as several in the Essay on Man published a few months later. One possible inference clearly is that those sections may have been machined at the same time. A more complex relationship occurs in the 1729 editions, all printed by John Wright and published by Lawton Gilliver. 17 The first Dunciad of that year was a quarto edition, issued on both ordinary and fine paper. The ordinary paper has varieties of an 'S' watermark; as we have seen, this paper is also used for most of the first octavo edition of that year. The quarto's addenda leaf, when present, is on 'TM'-marked paper, the same as in the rest of the first octavo. That paper appears still again in the half-sheet errata section in the second octavo edition. Meanwhile, the varieties of eagle-marked paper of the fine-paper quarto recur throughout the second octavo. A curious problem arises here: why would this special—and presumably more expensive—paper be used for a reprint edition in a small format? The answer may lie partly in the significance Pope attached to the edition; he wrote Swift that he wanted it to be used as the copy for future printings. 18 But the answer may also lie in other facts revealed by paper. An octavo piracy ('Printed for A. Dob'; Foxon P774-775) published by a group of London booksellers within days of the authorized first octavo was on the same varieties of good paper. The publishers had also taken special effort to reproduce the engravings of the title page and the headpiece at the beginning of Book I. In Gilliver's lawsuit which followed, the defendants noted that, among other problems, the copies of the quarto edition tardily deposited with the Stationers' Company were not on the better paper but "upon much worse." 19 The pirates' main strategy in court was to show that copyright for the book had not been clearly established and that therefore their edition was in fact not a piracy. Pointing out the inferior quality of the quarto deposit copies served the logical point of challenging the copyright claims for that book but also served the ethical point of showing these pirates' good intent, for their edition appeared not as a cheaply constructed attempt to capitalize on a popular work but rather as an expensively produced edition of a work not formerly available in a small format. It may be, then, that to produce an octavo edition on paper of comparable quality Pope specified that the next edition under his control, the second octavo, be printed on the same eagle-marked sheets. Whatever the ultimate explanation, it is again paper evidence that reveals connections among these four books. Precise identification of paper varieties can also on occasion help to establish the dates that the paper was used. Bowyer's paper ledger reveals that the paper for volumes II and V of Pope's small-paper Works of 1751 was ordered together. 20 That spring and summer 92 reams were received on March 21, 52 reams on April 9, 40 reams on June 27, 24 reams on July 2, and 12 reams on July 12. All of the 14½ original sheets of volume II and 9 of the 20½ sheets of volume V are on unwatermarked paper, though the varieties in the two books are not the same. As indicated earlier, the remaining 11½ sheets of volume V (the last gatherings and some of the preliminaries) have the mark 'RW' or one of two special varieties of unmarked paper. The ratios of the number of similar sheets in the volumes to the total number of sheets are similar to the ratios of reams in individual shipments to the total number of reams ordered for these volumes: 14.5 sheets (unmarked, vol. II) [1:2.4] 92 reams [1:2.4] 9 (unmarked, vol. V) [1:3.9] 52 [1:4.2] 11.5 (marked, and unique [1:3.0] 40} unmarked, vol. V) 24} =76 [1:2.9] 12} If those correspondences are in fact significant, and if, as is likely, the paper was used in approximately the order purchased, then within this group volume II was printed first, followed by the unmarked sections of volume V and then by the marked ones—i.e. the last gatherings of the poetic text, the appendix and indexes, and most of the preliminaries. From the dates the paper was purchased, the actual printing dates of the sections could also be estimated. A final determination of the correspondence would require a test of the typographical evidence as well as possible adjustments for the number of sheets in these particular reams, the paper which the ledger indicates was returned to the wholesaler, the wasted sheets, leftover paper from other projects which found its way into this one, and the number of copies actually printed (which, as Bowyer's ledgers reveal, often differed from the number officially ordered.) The estimation of the printing dates based on paper evidence is by no means conclusive, then, but the investigation itself is possible only because the similarities and differences among the paper varieties have been precisely determined, primarily by the measurement of their chain spaces. Still another use of such detailed paper evidence is to determine the original relationships or imposition patterns of specially printed leaves that are not currently conjugate. This procedure depends on an earlier establishment of chain space models and of the other relevant features of the paper. The 1729 quarto Dunciad provides the first example. K1.2 is a pair of cancel leaves, and gathering P is a half-sheet. In the ordinary-paper issue, both of the predominant varieties of the 'S' watermark occur in each section. In the seven copies for which I have measurements, one of the half-sheets is always marked and one is not, and the chain spaces reveal that they are always from the same variety of paper as each other. The tantalizing inference is that these half-sheets were originally part of the same sheet. That conclusion is confirmed by the Edinburgh University copy, in which the half-sheets are bound together and are conjugate. With that copy available, the evidence provided by the paper is largely superfluous, although besides corroborating the other finding it presents evidence of the binder's practice in apparently inserting both halves of a particular sheet into the same book. The example is useful in showing the potential of such paper evidence. The facts here lead to the correct conclusion, although they are not themselves conclusive. But by suggesting a relationship, they encourage the researcher to seek further evidence. Here, for instance, the bibliographer who would go on to examine running titles would find that those on K1.2 and P 2 are the same ones as elsewhere in the book and that when those from the two half-sheets are combined they form the same set that appears in other gatherings. A second case in which an imposition pattern may be inferred comes from the second octavo Dunciad of 1729. With only one exception, which will be considered in a moment, the cancel leaves D3, E2, and P3 and the single-leaf errata 2 B 1 are all from the same two varieties of eagle paper as the rest of the book. Tranchefiles occur only in examples of D3 and 2 B 1, indicating that these leaves were printed at the end of the sheet of paper. On the other hand, the most easily identifiable portion of watermark, the portion of an eagle design which occurs toward the center of the sheet, occurs only in E2 and P3. These leaves, then, were printed as the inside ones of the octavo imposition. The absence of tranchefiles in any examples of these leaves in the three dozen copies checked support that positioning. That the leaves come from adjacent parts of the sheet suggests that some of them may have been pairs. This is certainly true for 2 B 1 and the new P3, for they are bound together and conjugate in a copy at Oxford. The paper evidence also supports Foxon's surmise that "the cancels for D3 and E2 were probably printed together" (P781). But Foxon does not think that these two quarter-sheets in turn were conjugate: "Deposit copies apparently have one pair of leaves or the other, which suggests they were not part of the same half sheet and were therefore printed at different times, though before publication." The word apparently is very likely inserted because of the difficulty in ascertaining copyright deposit copies. But in at least one of those apparent deposit copies, that at Aberdeen University, both pairs of leaves are present. Among the other deposit copies various combinations of old and new leaves appear, a pattern reflected in the non-deposit copies. It is by no means clear, then, that the two sets of leaves were printed separately. The details of the leaves indicate that they were all printed on the same two varieties of paper, and those details are at least commensurate with those leaves being part of the same half-sheet. 2 B 1 and D3 would be the outer leaves on the sheet, and P3 and E2 the corresponding inner ones. That hypothesis gains further strength from paper evidence in the only identified exceptions to the pattern of double-chain, eagle-watermark paper for the cancels. In a personal copy, formerly that of James M. Osborn, 2 B 1 and the new D3 and E2 are from the same setting of type as the other examples but are all on single-chain paper. (P3 was can-celled but then the original leaf reinserted.) That all of these anomalous leaves are on the same paper suggests that at least in this case—and very likely in the other instances—the cancels were printed together. 21 In the pursuit of paper evidence, just as in other bibliographical study, it is important that the bibliographer search as widely as possible. As shown by the single occurrence of single-chain paper in the cancels of the second octavo Dunciad Variorum , that search first of all needs to encompass as many copies as possible. But ultimately that research should also extend to other works produced by the same publisher or printer, and even to works by other publishers and printers produced about the same time. We have seen hints of the benefits of such study in the identification of the anomalous horse watermark in one Dunciad and in the explanation of a couple of unusual sheets of a 1743 Dunciad by reference to a slightly later edition of An Essay on Man . In practice, such widespread investigations remain merely ideal goals. But precisely because such goals are difficult for a single worker to achieve, they serve to remind researchers of the importance of recording the results of smaller projects so that those findings may cumulatively form a body of reference material. Throughout this essay we have considered reasons for recording particular characteristics of paper that are usually overlooked. They can often extend the range of insights available from more familiar features such as watermarks, but even more importantly they can provide evidence which those other qualities cannot furnish. These methods are valuable even if they merely duplicate other findings, for they give additional credibility to those interpretations. Likewise, they are important even if they are not conclusive, for they often stimulate new approaches which do yield such results. Finally, if they do nothing else, these ways of analyzing paper serve as another reminder for bibliographers to be cautious when claiming that two items are printed on "the same paper." 22</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Mode of Existence of Literary Works of Art: The Case of the Dunciad Variorum by James McLaverty</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a section of his Essays in Critical Dissent entitled "The Philistinism of 'Research,'" the late F. W. Bateson laid down a challenge to bibliographers which, so far as I know, has never been taken up directly. The question he poses is roughly this: if the Mona Lisa is in the Louvre, where are Hamlet and Lycidas ? what is the essential physical basis of a literary work of art? 1 Bateson's answer, a somewhat surprising one given that Hamlet is one of his examples, is that the physical basis is "human articulations"; "the literary original exists physically in a substratum of articulated sound" (pp. 7-8). A book, he claims, has the same sort of imperfect relationship to the original work as a photograph has to the man photographed; it is a "translation" or "reproduction" (p. 7). It follows from this, Bateson argues, that the bibliographer is guilty of mistaking the secondary for the primary: he busies himself preserving the author's "accidentals," when the author's responsibility stops with the sounds; the bibliographer confuses the function of the author with that of his copyist (p. 8). To much of this the bibliographer will have a ready answer, but the importance of these criticisms lies in their level of generality; they call for a justification of certain bibliographical attitudes in terms of aesthetic theory and they raise, in vivid if eccentric fashion, several of the crucial issues in aesthetics today. Without presuming to speak for bibliography, I want to challenge Bateson's conclusions on these issues and to suggest that the physical appearance of books sometimes has even greater importance than textual bibliographers are willing to allow it. I believe that leading writers on aesthetics—writers quite independent and even ignorant of the world of bibliography—are able to give solutions to Bateson's problems which, far from diminishing the role of the written or printed word, emphasise the importance of notation. That they are right can, I believe, be confirmed by an examination of a work not generally associated with concrete poetry or the margins of literary art, the Dunciad Variorum . Because of its historical position, the Variorum highlights the problems associated with the mode of existence of literary works, and I think it can be shown that Pope exploits the potentialities of the printed word in such special ways that to neglect the meanings he thereby creates is to risk misinterpretation of the work. The most comprehensive and penetrating discussion so far of the mode of existence of works of art is to be found in Richard Wollheim's Art and Its Objects . 2 Wollheim's starting point is to consider the very simple hypothesis that works of art are physical objects; but as soon as he begins to do so the general category "works of art" begins to split into two: on the one hand, we find painting, sculpture, and architecture, and, on the other, music, drama, ballet, and, it would seem, literature. Of course, a strong case may be, and has been, urged against identifying even painting, sculpture, and architecture with physical objects, but at least in the case of those arts there are arguments to be made. If I am asked where the physical object which is the Mona Lisa is, I can point to the canvas in the Louvre, and similar possibilities present themselves with Donatello's St. George or Vanbrugh's Blenheim . But if I am asked for Ulysses , or Der Rosenkavalier , or Swan Lake , I am in difficulties. There are physical objects or events I call Ulysses or Der Rosenkavalier —the book or score on my desk, the reading to the Joyce Society, or the performance by the Keele Amateur Opera Club—but I cannot simply identify one of these with Ulysses or Rosenkavalier . As Wollheim, from whom I draw this argument, insists, we cannot identify the book on the desk with Ulysses because if we did it would follow that if that book were lost the work itself would be lost. That is obviously unsatisfactory, and, since we often refer to the book on the desk as my "copy" of Ulysses , the next step might reasonably be to look for the physical object Ulysses of which my book is the copy. The obvious candidate is the author's manuscript, or the fair copy which Greg and McKerrow aimed to recover (and which Bateson unjustifiably uses to accuse them of identifying the work with a script). But the solution which identifies the work with the author's manuscript encounters precisely the same problems as the one which points to the book on the desk: if the Mona Lisa is burnt, we say the work is lost, no matter how many copies remain, but an author's manuscripts may come (that is, be rediscovered) and go without any necessary effect on the existence of the work of art. The problems raised by Der Rosenkavalier are yet greater because the autograph score does not seem to be an instance of the work at all; Rosenkavalier seems to require a performance, but no one performance, it seems, is identifiable with the work. The question of the mode of existence of literary works, therefore, seems to be closely tied up with questions of identity and with differences between the arts. Since much relevant discussion hinges on these differences, it may be useful to list them before moving on to consider accounts of them and their usefulness to the bibliographer. At this stage it is probably wise to leave literature aside and concentrate on the distinction between painting and sculpture on the one hand and music, drama, and ballet on the other. The status of prints, architecture, and literature is often problematic. Painting and Sculpture Music, Drama, and Ballet (1) identity unproblematic—may be identified with some particular thing identity problematic (2) atemporal temporal (3) no distinction required between creator and performer distinction required between creator and performer (4) creator as such produces those things of which the work consists creator does not produce those things of which the work consists (5) work can be forged; identity depends on history of production work cannot be forged; identity free of history of production (6) work is a particular work is a type with tokens 3 There is nothing to be said at this stage about (1), for it was the starting point of our inquiry. The temporal/atemporal distinction is one which both Bateson and J. O. Urmson think important. Bateson seems to believe that it explains why the literary work is "invisible" (p. 10), but he must be mistaken because ballet is clearly visible and temporal; there is no good reason why a work should not be both. Urmson believes that the temporal/atemporal distinction is the most important between the arts: "There is a distinction between works of art which is logically fundamental; some works of art include a series of events and thus take time, while others include no events and do not take time" (p. 239). He regards the status of literature in this respect as problematic: he argues that when we read War and Peace or Milton's sonnet on his blindness, we do not witness events (reading about them is not witnessing them) and, though reading one takes longer than reading the other, that is not important because it also applies to looking at a mural and a miniature, and they are atemporal (p. 240). I am not persuaded by this argument. It is not simply that the reader of a novel, like the viewer of a painting, takes time, the literary work itself is temporal: one syllable follows another, word follows word, and sentence follows sentence. The eye of the viewer is free to traverse the painting in different ways, starting at different points, but the reader must (on the first reading) work through a poem or novel in strict sequence. The work itself determines the temporal experience of the reader. The criterion of "witnessing events" is probably at fault here. It does not provide a very natural way of thinking about listening to a symphony or reading a novel, and it properly belongs under point (3) rather than under point (2). However, this infiltration of (2) by (3) is useful in emphasising the importance of the latter, and Urmson does well to stress the problematic nature of literature in this respect. Novels and poems do not seem to require any element of performance for their proper appreciation—we all now read silently—and yet it seems they can be performed (poems often are) and we can construct a chain taking us from poetry through drama and opera to music. This is a complex question to which I shall return, but first it is necessary to look in a general way at (4) and the different creative processes in the arts. Professor Wollheim points out in a brilliant short essay, "On an Alleged Inconsistency in Collingwood's Aesthetic," 4 that literature shares with music the potentiality for being created in the artist's head. Wollheim considers the following art-activities: writing a (short) poem; composing a tune; painting a picture; making a sculpture (he ignores cast sculpture, as I have earlier). The first two can be done in the artist's head, without materials, but the second two cannot. As he remarks, "a natural way of thinking about making a sculpture in one's head, or, for that matter, painting a picture in one's head, is as imagining making a sculpture or imagining painting a picture: whereas to talk of imagining writing a (short) poem is in no sense a natural way of talking about writing a (short) poem in one's head, for it is to talk of something quite different" (p. 255). Wollheim believes this points to a basic division between the arts and argues that painting and sculpture should be classified as work of art-particulars and music and literature as work of art-types (point (5) on the list). He argues as follows: (i) that it is a sufficient condition of the making of a work of art-type that one should internally produce (e.g. say to oneself, play to oneself) a token of that type; (ii) that it is a sufficient condition of a work of art's being a work of art-type that it should be expressible in a notation; 5 (iii) that the discrepancy between an art activity and the internalized version of it arises acutely, or more acutely, with work of art-particulars (p. 256). The reference to notation here is obviously of exceptional interest to the bibliographer. In order to appreciate it fully we need to explore Wollheim's terms. The type/token distinction stems from Charles Sanders Peirce in his consideration of graphs and signs: A common mode of estimating the amount of matter in a MS. or printed book is to count the number of words. There will ordinarily be about twenty the 's on a page, and of course they count as twenty words. In another sense of the word "word," however, there is but one word "the" in the English language; and it is impossible that this word should lie visibly on a page or be heard in any voice, for the reason that it is not a Single thing or Single event. It does not exist; it only determines things that do exist. Such a definitely significant Form, I propose to term a Type . A Single event which happens once and whose identity is limited to that one happening or a Single object or thing which is in some single place or any one instant of time, such event or thing being significant only as occurring just when and where it does, such as this or that word on a single line of a single page of a single copy of a book, I will venture to call a Token . ( Collected Papers , ed., Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss (1933), iv, 423.) The application of this distinction to music and literature strikes one intuitively as right. The difference between "the" on the single line and "the" in the language does seem to be the same as the difference between my copy of Ulysses and Ulysses the work of art, or between tonight's performance of Der Rosenkavalier and Der Rosenkavalier the work of art. When we say the novel begins "Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead" or that the opera begins with the Marschallin and Octavian alone together on stage, we are talking of the type, but when we say that a page is missing or that the tempo is too slow, we are talking of the token. This explanation takes account of Bateson's feeling that the work must somehow start off in the creator's head, "what he is really copying is this oral drama of the mind in its definitive form" ( Essays in Critical Dissent , p. 8), without agreeing to the idea which goes with it that all subsequent instances are merely copies and that the audience has no real encounter with the work. Wollheim would agree that the writer or composer creates a token of the type in his head, but there is no good reason for saying the type is in his head: "It is certainly true that there is a tune-token in the man's head, i.e. the tune-token that he plays in his head in the course of composing the tune, and it is also true that there could be, probably will be, other tune-tokens not in his head, i.e. those that are actually played if the tune receives that degree of attention in the real world. But it is unclear that this justifies us in saying the tune, where this now means the tune-type, is, or ever was, in the man's head: or, for that matter, out of it. The type is not in this way capable of location" (p. 259). Wollheim is prepared to argue, therefore, that although works of music and works of literature may not be physical objects (as paintings and sculptures may be), they may nevertheless be physical in the type/token way. Wollheim's reference to notation in his essay on Collingwood shows some interplay between his own ideas and those of Nelson Goodman, and it is from Nelson Goodman that he doubtless derives his interest in notation. Goodman's principle of distinction between the arts is different from Wollheim's, but much more sharply separates those which are amenable to notation from the rest. In his Languages of Art he starts from the observation that Rembrandt's Lucretia can be forged, while Haydn's London Symphony cannot, and nor can Gray's Elegy : "Let us speak of a work of art as autographic if and only if the distinction between original and forgery of it is significant; or better, if and only if even the most exact duplication of it does not thereby count as genuine. If a work of art is autographic, we may also call that art autographic. Thus painting is autographic, music nonautographic, or allographic ." 6 Goodman considers the possibility that the difference between them is that autographic arts are one-stage, whereas allographic arts are two-stage, but he rejects this on the grounds that literature is allographic and one-stage. The ground of difference he is considering is, of course, one that concerns Urmson (point (3) in the list), but while it leads Urmson to put literature aside with a status which is problematic, Goodman chooses to reject the criterion instead. For Goodman, even more than for Wollheim, the key to the matter is notation: "an art seems to be allographic just insofar as it is amenable to notation" (p. 121). The notation of a work provides us with a means of identifying it which is independent of the history of its production (as the identity of a painting is not independent of its history): To verify the spelling [Goodman is using the word in a very general sense here] or to spell correctly is all that is required to identify an instance of the work or to produce a new instance. In effect, the fact that a literary work [or a musical one] is in a definite notation, consisting of certain signs or characters that are to be combined by concatenation, provides the means for distinguishing the properties constitutive of the work from all contingent properties—that is, for fixing the required features and the limits of permissible variation in each (p. 116). Goodman is able to give some account of why arts differ in this way, why some are allographic and have notation while others do not. It may be that in the first place all arts were autographic, but some were more permanent than others: a painting, sculpture, or building lasts, but an epic recited or music played could only survive through memory. Such works were either lost or survived through loose criteria of identity (such as those which seem to have applied to oral epic poetry). The arts in which works were transitory (or, like architecture, depended on the co-operation of several persons) developed a notation. That involved, necessarily, distinguishing between the constitutive and contingent properties of a work. It could not be done arbitrarily, for the notation would then be unacceptable, but had to draw on a pre-existent sense of the identity of the work. That does not mean, of course, that notation has no effect on our sense of what constitutes a work. The creation of a notation might considerably modify that sense, and it is likely that over a period of time its influence would grow to be considerable. There is no room within the scope of this essay to examine Goodman's discussion of the requirements of a notational system, even were it within my capacity to do so, but his conclusions merit our attention. A musical score, he argues, is a true score, that is, it is a character in a notational system : the score defines the work but there are no competing definitions as there are in ordinary language; the score, unlike an ordinary definition, is uniquely determined by each member of the class it defines (p. 178). It is because of the notational system that we are able to move from score to performance, or from performance to score, or from score to score without (if we do not make any mistakes) impairing the identity of the work. Goodman has various qualifications to offer (tempo indications of the "andante" type are not notational), but his conclusion is that on the whole the musical score qualifies as a character in a notational system, and in that respect it is like a digital watch. There is, of course, no equivalent notational system for painting, and Goodman does not believe that there could be. As we noted in the general discussion of notation, the notation has to draw on an antecedent classification of works, even though it might modify it; developing the notation involves arriving at a definition of the notion of a work. As in painting the work is antecedently identified with a single picture, it is difficult to see how a notational system could legitimately widen the class which is the work to include several pictures: "This would call not just for such minor adjustments as occur in any systematization but for a drastic overhaul that would lump together in each compliance-class many antecedently different works. . . . To repudiate the antecedent classification is to disenable the only authority competent to issue the needed license" (p. 198). In other words, a notation will not be possible until there is a quite new idea of painting. The status of painting with regard to notation is relatively uncomplicated, just as, in a quite different way, that of music is; with literature, the position is more complex. Here is Goodman's conclusion: "The text of a poem or novel or biography is a character in a notational scheme. As a phonetic character, with utterances as compliants, it belongs to an approximately notational system. As a character with objects as compliants, it belongs to a discursive language" (p. 207). Goodman's meaning will become clearer if we look at what he says of the drama, which serves in some ways as an intermediate case between music and literature. "In the drama, as in music," he argues, "the work is a compliance-class of performances" (p. 210). Compliance is the inverse of "denotation," by which Goodman means reference in a way which excludes exemplification as a mode of reference. "Complies with" is interchangeable with "is denoted by" and "has as a compliant" is interchangeable with "denotes." A single inscription will denote many things (all the performances of Der Rosenkavalier , for example) and the class of these things constitutes the compliance-class of the inscription (p. 144). Hamlet , then, for Goodman, is the compliance-class of performances of Hamlet . The text of Hamlet is mainly a score; the dialogue is "in a virtually notational system, with utterances as its compliants." You get from text to performance and back again without losing the identity of the work, just as in music. The stage directions, on the other hand, are only supplementary instructions. It is readily apparent, therefore, that a literary text could either be taken as a score for utterances, or as a character in a language denoting people, places, and things. On this decision a great deal depends, as can be seen from an outline of alternatives: (1) The text is a score; it denotes utterances; it is a character in a notational system . The work is a compliance-class of performances. The physical "basis" of the art is speech. The text is not an instance of the work. (2) The text is a script; it denotes "objects;" it is a character in a discursive language. The work cannot be the compliance-class, because the compliance-class is a "set" 7 of objects, and which objects belong to the class might be indeterminable. The literary work, therefore, must be the text or script itself and its utterances: "All and only inscriptions and utterances of the text are instances of the work" (p. 209). Goodman chooses the second alternative because, he claims, "an utterance obviously has no better title to be considered an instance of the work than does an inscription of the text" (p. 208). We have here a major philosopher setting the boundaries for controversy in bibliography and textual criticism, and whether we take the text as a score or a script, we have moved a long way from Bateson's view of the text as simply a translation, or a copy as my photograph is a copy of me (not that it is). Even if all texts of literature had the same status as the dialogue in drama—that of a character in a notational system—they would not have the relation to the work of a copy or translation. One text might, of course, be a copy of another, but, provided it was copied correctly, it would be just as valid a score as the original; it would not, like the copy of a painting, be necessarily inferior to the original. Nor would the relation of the score to the work be that of a copy or translation: the text would define the work; the notation distinguishes constituent properties from contingent ones. If Bateson were right and the text of Hamlet were an attempt to copy the sounds in Shakespeare's head, or even those of the first performance, it would clearly be a failure: a mass of information about quality of sound, pitch, and duration would be lost; we would not have Hamlet . The play would, in Wollheim's terms, be a particular, and the work would be lost. It may still be correct to argue that Hamlet is a matter of human articulations; but, following Goodman, we must say that they are articulations compliant with the text. The text is a special definition of the work. The subsequent questions, what is required by compliance and whether there are redundant elements in the notational scheme, are ones of vital interest to bibliographers and require further investigation; but these questions are merely evaded by responses such as Bateson's. 8 All this, however, is to suppose that texts of literature should be regarded as scores with utterances as their compliants—the view most favourable to Bateson's case. As we have seen, Goodman decided otherwise, claiming that both utterances and inscriptions are instances of the work. If he is right, a text is as far removed as it possibly could be from being a copy of the work; it is, in so far as anything is, the work itself. This is a matter of some consequence and, at a fundamental level, the dispute over whether a text is a score or an instance of the work may underlie some of the controversy which has taken place in bibliography itself. For example, there has been much debate over whether an editor should ordinarily choose an autograph manuscript as copy-text or whether he would be better off choosing the first edition instead. There is a tendency for those who recommend choosing the manuscript to emphasise the role of the text as score—the important thing is to avoid error in transcription—while those who recommend the first edition are thinking of the qualities of the inscription available to the public. Certainly, those authors, Pope is an example, who take most interest in the qualities of the printed book are those who most lead the editor away from the manuscript. The same problems arise in debates about editing diaries, journals, and other unpublished matter, when it is sometimes argued that the precise details of the inscription are important, as they are not for published work. 9 It may be that these issues will only be settled by closer attention to how particular authors did regard the inscriptions of their work. An important challenge to Goodman's views and a defence of the idea that the text is a score rather than an instance of the work has come from Professor Barbara Herrnstein Smith; but the defence is mounted in such a way that it admits many exceptions and provides us with criteria for deciding whether or not the text is a score. I believe that close pursuit of this debate between Professors Goodman and Smith eventually leads to the truth of the matter. Professor Smith contends that "aside from concrete poetry (that is, "picture poems" or verbal constructions dependent on graphic presentation of their formal properties) and one other important class of exceptions to be mentioned later, the poem or literary artwork cannot be identified with its own inscription. Moreover, it may be identified with the utterance of its inscription only if one understands "utterance" in the sense of "performance" to be described hereafter." 10 She takes up immediately the obvious challenge to her view—that most reading of poetry (even in the narrow sense) is silent: A silent reading of a poem, however, is or may be a much more specific and precisely determined activity than looking at a picture or listening to music. The reader is required to produce, from his correct "spelling" of a spatial array of marks on a page, a temporally organized and otherwise defined structure of sounds—or, if you like, pseudo-sounds. The physical or neurophysiological source of the structure generated by the silent reader is of little significance here: it may originate somewhere in his musculature or peripheral or central nervous system, or the source may vary from reader to reader. What is significant is that the structure itself will not vary (p. 6). It will strike the reader that Professor Smith is on slippery ground here. Although she begins by declaring that she will use "poetry" in "the broad sense" to mean literary artworks, it is not clear that she holds to that throughout the essay, and it is not really clear how she is using the term in the passage just quoted: does she mean that all literary art requires sounds or pseudo-sounds, or is the requirement confined to poetry in the ordinary sense, or might it be extended to reading in general? Apparently the claim is for literary art, for Professor Smith says later: "Not every text is a score, because not every linguistic inscription is of a literary artwork. One cannot skim a poem or read it distractedly while listening to a conversation: not, that is, if one is to produce and experience it as an artwork" (p. 7). But a moment's reflection and introspection will show how unpersuasive this argument is: I cannot skim Professor Smith's essay or read it distractedly and understand it or be said to have read it properly, but that does not make it a "poem." At most, it seems that there may be some works which require some form of utterance and some that do not, and that literature may belong to the former. But the matter cannot be decided by Professor Smith's fiat : we need to decide whether reading does involve some sort of utterance, and, as we know there is "silent reading," we need to find out what pseudo-sounds might be. In psychology there have been a number of investigations of what is usually called subvocalization, but may also be called subvocal speech, or inner speech, or implicit speech, or covert oral responses. It is clear that there is such a thing because children, and adults, can sometimes be observed whispering or moving their lips while reading. Additional evidence comes from detailed investigations of adults (students about twenty-two years old) which were carried out in a medical setting by Åke W. Edfeldt in Stockholm. He measured muscle movement through electromyography, inserting needle electrodes directly into the speech musculature. He decided there was activity in the speech musculature during "silent" reading in all ten subjects, but he was cautious of generalising too far on this basis: "it was shown that silent speech probably occurs during all reading. It is, however, not possible to state categorically that such is the case, as some of the good readers showed less activity during reading than during relaxation." 11 Various other experiments giving similar results are reviewed by Eleanor J. Gibson and Harry Levin in their Psychology of Reading . 12 A different light, however, is thrown on the whole question by J. Baron's experiments, particularly that reported in "Phonemic Stage Not Necessary for Reading" in Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology , 25 (1973), 241-246. Baron found that his subjects could recognise whether or not a short phrase made sense just as quickly, regardless of whether the sound made sense. That is, they rejected "my knew car" just as quickly as "my no car," when, if they had been going through a phonemic stage, they should have taken longer over "knew car." However, it may be possible to integrate this finding with Edfeldt's, because it is generally agreed that subvocalization increases with the difficulty of the passages being read. Glenn M. Kleiman in "Speech Recoding in Reading" ( Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behaviour , 14 (1975), 323-339) presents a model of reading which he thinks accounts for the various results: printed sentence→visual encoding→lexical access→working memory storage processing→sentence comprehension. He believes that recoding into speech occurs after lexical access (recognition of the word and its meanings) and facilitates temporary storage of words necessary for sentence comprehension. This explains the disparity between Baron's findings (concerned only with lexical access) and Edfeldt's. There is some confirmation of this interpretation of the role of subvocalization in experiments reported by Maria L. Slowiaczek and Charles Clifton, Jr., in "Subvocalization and Reading for Meaning" ( Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behaviour , 19 (1980), 573-582). It was found that comprehension of difficult passages was severely impaired when subvocalization was suppressed by making the subjects count or recite "colacola" continuously. Slowiaczek's hypothesis is that subvocalization is used to combine concepts in the proper semantic relationship with one another; it helps us to understand by providing the extra information (intonation and rhythm, for example) that helps us to understand speech. These findings by psychologists give precise meaning to Professor Smith's "pseudo-sounds," establish that subvocalization is used to understand difficult texts, and thereby strengthen her case, but they also suggest that the text is something more than a score; the reader has access to meanings by looking directly at the page. Although Professor Smith insists in her discussion with Professor Goodman that there is a necessary element of subvocalization or performance in reading poetry, she seems very ready to admit that there may be variations on that pattern. One such variation would be concrete poetry and the range of pattern poems, altar poems, and calligrammes. A poem such as Eugen Gomringer's "Silence" 13 makes its point without any vocalization: silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence Similarly, Professor Smith suggests that whereas lyric poems represent (or imitate, or picture) personal utterances, prose fiction characteristically represents "inscribed discourse," and it follows that a literary work in that genre would be constituted by instances of its own text (p. 8). This suggestion, though it is difficult to reconcile with the position adopted earlier in her essay, is rich in possibilities: the argument now is that whether or not a text is a score depends on what that text imitates: if it imitates the spoken voice, it is a score; if it imitates inscribed discourse, it is not. A glance at the development of prose fiction gives the suggestion credibility: early novels presented themselves as other sorts of written discourse—letters ( Pamela ), journals and autobiographies ( Robinson Crusoe, Moll Flanders , and Tristram Shandy ). If real letters and journals imitate conversation and natural narratives, these early novels may be seen as imitations of imitations of personal utterances. Hence they will be able to draw on qualities of the human voice, such as tone and rhythm, but they will still be imitations of written discourse. This gives authors the opportunity of using the visual features of these written discourses if they wish. True, Pamela does not look like a bundle of letters, but Tristram Shandy with its black page and squiggles shows an awareness of the printed medium, even though it may be an uneasy one. In a suggestive and lucid article, Richard Shusterman has argued that the anomalous nature of literature stems from its historical development. 14 Before the invention of the printing press literature was an oral art and manuscripts served as scores; this was the only way an author could reach a public of any size. The printing press, however, gave him direct access to a large number of readers; and we find him addressing the "reader," rather than the listener. Those genres, lyric and epic poetry, for example, which grew up before the period of printing retain much of their oral character, while newer genres, such as the novel, are essentially printed. One might add that there has been cross-fertilization so that some novels thoroughly exploit the potentialities of literature for encoding speech effects, while some poetry makes use of the potentialities of the type-written or printed page. The advantage of Shusterman's and Smith's work is that it points to a period, the beginning of the eighteenth century, when authors first became conscious of the anomalous nature of literature and of the importance of printing. They began to imitate letters, journals, and autobiographies; they noticed the lack of direct contact with an audience and the introduction of powerful intermediaries, the publishers; and they noticed that literature had got caught up in print and paper. It is the world Pope's Dunciad sets out to describe and that the Dunciad Variorum ironically exemplifies. When the Twickenham edition of the Dunciad first appeared in 1943, it provoked a review essay of special brilliance from F. R. Leavis. His introductory comments, witty and provocative, are the ones of immediate interest to the bibliographer: Yes, one concedes grudgingly, overcoming the inevitable revulsion, as one turns the pages of this new edition (The 'Twickenham'), in which the poem trickles thinly through a desert of apparatus, to disappear time and again from sight—yes, there has to be a Dunciad annotated, garnished and be-prosed in this way. A very large proportion of the apparatus, after all, comes down from the eighteenth century with the poem, and the whole, though to read it all through will be worth no one's while, is enlightening documentation of the age that produced Pope and of which Pope made poetry. 15 The central points of contention arise when a voice echoingly replies, "A very large proportion of the apparatus, after all, comes down from Pope ." It is Pope who decided that the Dunciad should appear garnished and be-prosed, and it seems most likely that he had always intended that it should appear like that. Only a month after the poem had appeared for the first time, unannotated, Pope was explaining to Swift about a quite different mode of publication: "The Dunciad is going to be printed in all pomp . . . with Proeme, Prologomena, Testimonia Scriptorum, Index Authorum , and Notes Variorum ." 16 Leavis's preference may have been for poetry unadulterated, but that was not what Pope was prepared to provide. Any approach to the Dunciad Variorum which is based on respect for the author and his intentions must take it as a mixed work, poetry and prose, and must consider the relations between the two. The correct starting point, I believe, is that suggested by Professor Smith. The Dunciad Variorum is clearly an imitation not of spoken discourse but of written discourse; it is not a score. It is an imitation of a special and significant sort, because, while Pamela does not look like a bundle of letters, the Dunciad Variorum does look like a scholarly edition. In the Dunciad Variorum Pope is playing with the transition of literature from oral to written that Shusterman discusses. He is exploiting the fact, as Sterne with his black page and squiggles does later, that literature is seen as well as heard. And he is perhaps the first writer to exploit significantly the opportunities that affords. Leavis's remarks begin with the appearance of the page. He is such a good critic that he immediately finds a meaning there: twentieth-century scholarship in its overweening way obstructs the relation between poem and reader; our literary culture has its priorities wrong. His mistake lies in believing that the meaning he finds is unintentional; in fact Pope put it there as a reflection on his own culture; it is part of his exploitation of the medium. Pope intended his poem to be hemmed in by scholarship: the work was designed not only to refer to the dangerous plight of literature but to exemplify it as well. In order to achieve this, of course, Pope needed to give quite exceptionally detailed consideration to the format and styling of his work. That would not be uncharacteristic: as early as 1717 we find him writing to Broome with detailed instructions, "I desire . . . that you will cause the space for the initial letter to the Dedication to the Rape of the Lock to be made of the size of those in Trapp's Praelectiones," ( Correspondence , i, 394); it seems unlikely that his instructions later, when he had his own printer, John Wright, would be any less precise. Even now, I believe, we can be quite specific about the models for the Dunciad Variorum , and thereby come much closer to the way in which Pope wanted us to respond to his work. The spirit which haunts the pages of the Dunciad Variorum is that of Richard Bentley. He was not, paradoxically, associated with Variorum editions, and his high standing in classical scholarship in large measure derives from the way his insistence on the importance of the editor's judgement led scholars away from the mechanical compilation of others' interpretations and judgements. Variorum editing was instead closely associated with Dutch scholarship, and E. J. Kenney in The Classical Text describes this period in Holland (1700-1750) as "the age of the Variorum quartos." It was the age of the notorious Havercamp, of whose edition of Lucretius H. A. J. Munro claimed, "there is not one week's genuine work beyond what scissors and paste could do." 17 In calling his work a Variorum Pope must have had such work in mind—a much wider frame of reference than his critics generally allow him—and the Dunciad Variorum stands in ironic relation to OED 's first recorded occurrence of the term (in Chambers Cyclopaedia of, significantly, 1728): "The Variorums, for the generality, are the best Editions." 18 Nevertheless, Bentley's work dominated textual criticism in England in this period and directly affected Pope and his circle through the Epistles of Phalaris controversy and, most important, through Bentley's disciple Theobald. 19 Bentley's most famous work, because it produced most controversy, was his edition of Horace, and from our point of view the second edition, published in Amsterdam in 1713, is especially significant. The first edition published at Cambridge had at least relegated the notes to the back of the volume; in the Amsterdam edition they were placed at the foot of the page. This edition was particularly admired, especially by Theobald, who explained to Warburton that it was to be the model for his Shakespeare: "I mean to follow the form of Bentley's Amsterdam Horace, in subjoining the notes to the place controverted." 20 Any page of the Amsterdam Horace (Plate 1) will show how the appearance of the page served to fan controversy and why it appealed to Theobald. The author shares his page with the textual critic; sometimes (Bentley's first page is a good example) the author can be allowed very little space at all, two lines being considered an adequate ration. Add to this the emphasis Bentley and Theobald placed on the editor's responsibility for correcting the text and you have some idea of the significance of what I shall call Pope's choice of "format," not in the strict bibliographical sense (though the choice of quarto is important) but in the modern general sense of "style or manner of arrangement or presentation." To stop at this point, however, would be to simplify Pope's purposes and to consider the chosen format too superficially. Not all the notes to Pope's poem are ludicrous, and this suggests that he felt it needed explaining and amplifying: we need to know who Gildon is (I, 250), what the relation between Baeotia and Ireland might be (I, 23), the nature of the link between Saturn and lead (I, 26), and why the poet says that Curll's waters in their passage "burn" (II, 178). 21 A careful reading of the notes suggests Pope's approval of certain sorts of annotation, and a close look at the format confirms this. An examination of contemporary editions shows that the Dunciad Variorum resembles Bentley's Amsterdam Horace much less than it resembles the Geneva Boileau of 1716, and the similarities between the edition of Pope and the edition of Boileau are too great, I believe, for them to be coincidental. We know that Pope had a copy of the 1716 Boileau from Professor Mack's listing of his library; it was given to him by his friend James Craggs. 22 We also find the parallel between Pope and Boileau emphasised in the "Letter to the Publisher" in the Variorum , a "Letter" supposedly written by Cleland but doubtless composed by Pope himself: Having mention'd BOILEAU, the greatest Poet and most judicious Critic of his age and country, admirable for his talents, and yet perhaps more admirable for his judgment in the proper application of them; I cannot help remarking the resemblance betwixt Him and our Author in Qualities, Fame, and Fortune; in the distinctions shewn to them by their Superiors, in the general esteem of their Equals, and in their extended reputation amongst Foreigners . . . But the resemblance holds in nothing more, than in their being equally abus'd by the ignorant pretenders to Poetry of their times; of which not the least memory will remain but in their own writings, and in the notes made upon them (p. 13). The aim of the editor of the Geneva Boileau, Claude Brossette, was to keep the author's work as fresh and clear for posterity as it had been for his contemporaries. Brossette presents himself as no ordinary editor; he is the author's friend, conveying information entrusted to him by the author himself, and thus giving others a correct understanding of his works: "Ce n'est donc pas ici un tissu de conjectures, hazardées par un Commentateur qui devine: c'est le simple récit d'un Historien qui raconte fidellement, &amp; souvent dans les mêmes termes, ce qu'il a apris de la bouche de l'Auteur original" (p. VI). He deliberately distinguishes this sort of edition from those of the classics and criticises such editions in a way which would appeal to Pope: "Au défaut de ces connoissances, les Commentateurs qui sont venus aprés, ont été obligés de se renfermer dans la critique des mots, critique seche, rebutante, peu utile; et quand ils ont tenté d'éclaircir les endroits obscurs, à peine ont-ils pû s'élever au dessus des doutes &amp; des conjectures" (p. VIII). The authority of his edition and its notes is expressed in the mode of presentation—a mode which he remarks on and which is remarked on in turn by the Amsterdam edition of 1718 which departs from it—he gives his notes the titles Changemens, Remarques , and Imitations , each group serving a special purpose. If we compare the Dunciad Variorum and the Geneva Boileau side by side (Plates 2 and 3), we see the strong set of similarities between them: (1) The notes are plentiful and are placed at the foot of the page, as those in the Amsterdam Horace are. I believe Pope was the first English poet to be annotated in this way. The notes to Pope's Odyssey are at the foot of the page, but the notes to the Shakespeare are not. (2) The notes are divided into sections by headings. (a) Two of the headings, Remarques/Remarks and Imitations, are the same. Pope has no Changes. (b) The headings are in italic capitals. (c) Both use two columns with a dividing rule for Remarks; the Variorum also uses them for Imitations. (3) The styling is similar. (a) Both print Vers or VERSE in full. (b) Both use italic and a square bracket to separate the lemma from the annotation. Further quotations in the notes are in italic. The most notable difference between the two, the absence of changemens , serves only to point further to the influence of Boileau on Pope. Pope's long friendship with the Richardsons involved an arrangement by which Jonathan Richardson, Jr., received copies of Pope's manuscripts and printed books in order that he might collate them. In 1737 Pope sent him a special copy of his works with large margins, "knowing how good an use he makes of them in all his books; &amp; remembring how much a worse writer, far, than Milton, has been mark'd, collated, &amp; studied by him" ( Correspondence , iv, 78). Richardson later claimed to have all the manuscripts of an Essay on Man "from the first scratches of the four books, to the several finished copies" and explained that he had been given them for the "pains I took in collating the whole with the printed editions, at his request, on my having proposed to him the 'making an edition of his works in the manner of Boileau's.'" 23 Pope aimed, therefore, to have his works presented in an edition to equal Boileau's. The Geneva edition has a splendid frontispiece with a portrait of Boileau and an inscription which poses this question: Boileau sut remplacer Horace, Seul il sut remplacer et Perse et Juvenal; Mais de cet auteur sans égal Qui remplira jamais la place? The answer given clearly by the Dunciad Variorum is Alexander Pope. The annotation bites two ways: it ridicules the textual scholarship of Bentley and Theobald, but it also honours the poem. The pomp of the presentation is genuinely appropriate to the poem's importance; the ancillary material makes it clear that we have here the work of a major author, an important sociological document, and a witty and learned poem. Pope gains these benefits without having to submit to an external commentator and without even giving the impression of taking himself too seriously. His delight in having, through his ironies, gained the best of both worlds is evident in a letter to Tonson, Sr., of 14 November 1731, at the time of the publication of Bentley's Milton and Theobald's Shakespeare: "I think I should congratulate your Cosen on the new Trade he is commencing, of publishing English classicks with huge Commentaries. Tibbalds will be the Follower of Bentley, &amp; Bentley of Scriblerus. What a Glory will it be to the Dunciad, that it was the First Modern Work publish'd in this manner?" ( Correspondence , iii, 243-244). Pope's interest in the format of the Dunciad Variorum and its intimate connection with the meaning of the work—only through his wit can the great writer survive the depredations of his culture—help to establish Professor Smith's belief that some works are essentially imitations of written discourse. They also support the concomitant conclusion that the author may, if he wishes, exploit the physical appearance of his discourse for his own ends. The exploitation of the printed medium in Herbert's "Easter Wings" or the mouse's tail in Alice is essentially trivial because appearance simply echoes sense and makes no positive contribution to the work. Moreover, the medium is exploited in a very general way: no account is taken of the details of print and paper. Pope's exploitation is much more precise and is therefore much richer in significance. The knowledgeable reader approaching the Variorum would note the parallel with Bentley's Horace and the "authorized" edition of Boileau; alert to ridicule of editorial absurdities and the ways in which they distort and obstruct poetic meaning, he would nonetheless be ready to link the poem to its social world and the classical analogies it draws on. From a glance at the page he would be prepared for a complex pleasure, one demanding considerable powers of discrimination. This degree of complexity is important. We saw that Leavis, in his review of the Twickenham volume, resented it. His objection to the annotation is not a trivial one; indeed, in so far as it concerns Sutherland's intermingling of his own notes with Pope's it is fully justified. The notes are part of the work and Sutherland has blundered into making himself a sort of co-author; if the annotation has the kind of significance I have suggested, the addition of modern commentary on the same page shows considerable insensitivity. But Leavis has a more general point in mind, which is that any attention to the notes disrupts the reading of the poem. Bateson likes his poems to be a sequence of sounds, but the notes of the Dunciad Variorum , if we attend to them, will not permit that, for it is impossible to integrate the voice of the notes with the voice of the poem. Notes work only visually; there is no place for them (or no acknowledged or definite place) in the performance of the poem. On the page of the Variorum we have competing voices: the poet's; the poet-as-annotator's; Scriblerus's. We have to heed them all and then integrate them, if we can, into a full understanding of the work. Fredric Jameson has remarked on the ways in which modern artists (he cites Schoenberg and Stravinsky, but we might add Picasso and Pound) deliberately make their work difficult in order to save it from being consumed: he describes a pressure to trivialise, to succumb to the market, to produce musak or pulp fiction. 24 These pressures are, of course, the subject of Pope's poem and he manipulates the materials of production in order to evade them. The Dunciad Variorum , like the music of Schoenberg, seeks fit audience, though few. I believe that since Williams's seminal study, Pope's "Dunciad" , was published in 1955 the audience of the Dunciad Variorum has listened too intently to the voice of Scriblerus and that Scriblerus's view of the poem as the epic of the transfer of the kingdom of Dulness—an epic largely cut-off from the sordid conflicts of Pope's world—has come to dominate our thinking. Only when the whole work is attended to once more will this distortion be corrected. My response to Bateson's challenge is, therefore, to claim that the existence of works of art as print and paper is not less but more important than bibliographers have generally taken it to be. Of course, Bateson's case stems from a confusion of work of art-particulars and work of art-types: just because plays and poems are not objects like paintings and statues, it does not follow that they are not physical, or even that they are not visual. The weakest case for the bibliographer is that literary texts are scores, and that does not mean that they are copies of the work; it means that they define the work—as Goodman puts it, "the work is a compliance class of performances," performances compliant with the text (p. 210). It is essential, therefore, that all elements of the score are retained from copy to copy. All elements, that is, that are truly part of the score, that are necessarily there. Complicated questions parallel to those of synonymy are raised here which bibliographers may need to consider further. It seems, however, that it is also valid to regard works in the post-Gutenberg era as having inscriptions as their instances; some works are imitations of written works and may exploit the written, or printed, medium. I have tried to indicate how this might have been done in the case of the Dunciad Variorum . My discussion of that work is necessarily incomplete, but I hope I have shown that the presentation of the text is open to exploitation by the author, that it can carry specific associations, and that a richer understanding of the relation of author, book trade, and public may lead to better interpretation of literary works. There is here a whole field of bibliographical investigation, one concerned with the significance of format and habits of reading, and bibliographers are only just beginning to cultivate it. 25</field>

She Stoops to Conquer and Textual Criticism" in Evidence in Literary Scholarship: Essays in Memory of James Marshall Osborn , ed. René Wellek and Alvaro Ribeiro (1979), pp. 263-279. A response (to which this essay gives extended support) came from G. Thomas Tanselle, "Recent Editorial Discussion and the Central Questions of Editing," Studies in Bibliography , 34 (1981), 57 n.67. 3 The idea of such a list comes from J. O. Urmson's "The Performing Arts" in Contemporary British Philosophy , 4th series, ed. H. D. Lewis (1976), pp. 239-252. Only the first four items in my list are Urmson's and he would dispute the validity of (6). The source of (5) and (6) will be apparent later. Urmson elaborates these ideas in "Literature" in Aesthetics , ed. G. Dickie and R. Sclafani (1977), pp. 334-341. 4 On Art and the Mind (1973), pp. 250-260; first published in Critical Essays on the Philosophy of R. G. Collingwood , ed. M. Krausz (1972), pp. 68-78. 5 It should be noted that (i) and (ii) are not necessary conditions; prints are work of art-types and do not fulfil these conditions. Nelson Goodman argues that (ii) is not even a sufficient condition because there could be a notation based on the history of production, "Comments on Wollheim's Paper," Ratio , 20 (1978), 49-51. But a lot hinges on the meaning of Wollheim's "expressible." 6 Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols (1969), p. 113. 7 "Set" is my own desperate unphilosophical choice. It is easy to see that "tree" might denote a class of objects in the world, but it is more difficult to see how the whole text denotes in that way. 8 This is to suggest that there may be a theoretical sense in which certain features of the text are "accidental," as opposed to Greg's practical sense. Tom Davis's acute observations on "accidentals" in "The CEAA and Modern Textual Editing," Library , 5th ser., 32 (1977), 63-74, have received too little notice, though they met with a shrewd critical response from G. Thomas Tanselle, "Recent Editorial Discussion and the Central Questions of Editing," SB , 34 (1981), 36-40. It will be apparent that my frequent proviso, "if we copy exactly," explains the bibliographer's emphasis on the holograph or first edition. 9 I am aware that these disputes are usually couched in other terms, often concentrating on the author's intentions; but that may not be the best approach. The best guide through these mazes of controversy is G. Thomas Tanselle in "Greg's Theory of Copy-Text and the Editing of American Literature," SB , 28 (1975), 167-229, and "The Editing of Historical Documents," SB , 31 (1978), 1-56, reprinted in Selected Studies in Bibliography (1979), pp. 245-307 and 451-506. 10 On the Margins of Discourse: The Relation of Literature to Language (1978), p. 5.

      <field name="heading_text">Stretching a Point: Or, The Case of the Spaced-out Comps by D. F. McKenzie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is always disturbing when logic outruns judgement. We feel obliged to accept an argument but remain, inexplicably and therefore silently, unconvinced by it, troubled by a gentle but patently unfair scepticism based on no more than a conviction, bred of our own imperfect and mixed experience, that things can't have been quite like that. Take, for example, these two propositions: first, one compositor may be distinguished from another by his manner of spacing punctuation; second, a compositor will, more often than not, set type from the same pair of cases, so that recurring types may be used to plot his work. Since the propositions are simple, and the evidence adduced to exemplify them wholly inferential, it is not difficult to achieve a logical formulation. When there are parallel structures conceived to the same end they will, syncretically as it were but not logically, reinforce one another. So the identification of compositors by spelling, or the division of work between compositors according to a pattern of skeleton-formes, may extend the series of tests and, where they match up, convert correspondence into truth. Because such tests are only syncretically or accretively, but not logically, related, it is no great loss to the argument if any one of them fails. One merely shifts ground. Were they logically dependent upon one another, since they are directed to the same end ('There were three men at work; here, there and there; namely Tom, Dick and Harry.'), the failure of any one test might be thought, if not to refute, at least to bring seriously into question the validity of the others. Well aware that Gertrude thought the study of empty space a sure sign of madness, and an eye bent to that purpose a deformity in Nature, I nevertheless thought it might be of some service to ask: can the first proposition above be tested? Has it the reliable status we expect of theories which have preoccupied so many editorial projectors, commanded so many hours of scholarly time, transmuted so much vacancy into learned articles? 1 Thinking that one solitary but incontrovertible instance would give some philosophical dignity to disbelief, I found that I could test a comparable method on a book of some substance in which the compositorial stints and press-work were well-documented. But before I report the results, a few words on the spacing of punctuation as a compositorial practice may not be out of place. The great merit of spaced punctuation as evidence is its purely typographic, if not wholly arbitrary, nature. It is largely independent of copy-influence and indifferent to chronology, of a frequency high enough to imply developed habits, and it appears in texts of several languages, set by compositors of any European nationality. Justification, and a medial or terminal position, may affect frequency, but these are discernible and so discountable influences on the statistics. There are of course various ways in which marks of punctuation may be spaced: the spaces may be placed before or after the mark and may vary in thickness. But such variation merely strengthens the basic assumption that the variety observed indicates the idiosyncratic practices of the men who transferred those palpable, leaden spaces from case to stick. Those who have recently used such evidence have not, I think, offered any 'rationale' for the spacing of punctuation marks; and indeed that does seem a singularly inappropriate demand of a practice so apparently personal, insubstantive and 'accidental'. And yet experience prompts. 'Should I put a space before a comma?', every new student asks. What did an old hand say to apprentices in those early habit-forming days of their youth? 'Lard out your line, lad; fat formes fill fast'? Or ' Tight -setting, son, sees the job soon done'? Moxon must have assumed some such gnomic instruction at case for he has nothing comparable to Fertel's discussion, 'Des Espaces, &amp; de leur usage', at pp. 16-18 of La Science Pratique de l'Imprimerie (Saint Omer, 1723): Pour la separation des ponctuations on doit toujours, autant qu'il se peut, mettre une espace devant la virgule, &amp; le point-virgule, &amp; deux aprés; ou une fine devant et une grosse aprés, c'est-a-dire plus d'espace aprés la virgule qu'on en aura mis devant. Mais si on étoit fort géné, soit pour mettre quelques lettres qu'on auroit oubliées en composant, ou qu'un Auteur changeroit quelques mots dans son épreuve, de sorte qu'on serait obligé de serrer les mots de la ligne, pour faire entrer la correction; pour lors on pourrait ôter les espaces qui seroient devant les virgules de la ligne; mais pour le pointvirgule, on doit autant qu'il se peut faire, laisser une fine espace devant &amp; aprés. So Fertel says, in effect, that there are rules and he hints that they have a purpose. There is a good practical reason for keeping a line easy and open (apprentices take note), and that in turn implies at least one cause of variation in a pattern—later adjustment to take in corrections. 2 For a sophisticated formulation of the rules, however, it would be hard to go beyond that of Bertrand-Quinquet whose own book, printed by his own firm, also exemplifies them. His Traité de l'Imprimerie (Paris, An VII = 1799), pp. 126-128, specifies seven marks of punctuation and the 'manière de les placer dans la composition'. I cite only his comments on the comma and full point: Comma: LES Anglais, les Allemands et les Suisses la placent toujours immédiatement après la lettre, sans espace. Les Italiens et les Espagnols, la mettent entre deux espaces égales; les Français entre deux espaces inégales, dont celle qui précède la virgule est moins forte que celle qui la suit. Full point: LES Français sont dans l'usage de le placer immédiatement après la lettre, sans espaces, et de le faire suivre d'espaces plus fortes que celles qui se trouvent entre les mots, afin de mieux désigner la terminaison complette de la phrase. The extension of the principle from one compositor to a whole nation of compositors has its own theoretical interest, for it is, in form, precisely that—an extension of the same fundamental assumption that compositors, the wordiest of men, may paradoxically give themselves away in, to coin a Pascalian phrase, 'le silence infernal de ces espaces finies': LES différentes manières de placer les signes de la ponctuation désignent à l'observateur attentif le lieu où ont été faites les éditions. C'est à leur manière de ponctuer que les contrefacteurs se font plus facilement reconnaitre; c'est par-là qu'ordinairement ils se trahissent et se décèlent. Pour la plupart ils ne connaissent pas ces petites différences, ils suivent aveuglément leurs anciennes habitudes; ceux mêmes qui les connaissent, ont beau y faire attention, il est bien difficile que, dans un ouvrage de longue haleine, rien ne leur échappe; et alors celui dont on vole la propriété, sûr de son fait, peut poursuivre le voleur, sinon devant la loi, au moins le signaler à l'opinion publique. Logically of course, Bertrand-Quinquet's proposition may offer difficulties. For example, distinct national patterns within the same text could be taken to attest division of work between countries as well as between compositors; conversely, it could be taken to evidence a cosmopolitan compositorial companionship in the same shop. Lest either of those extensions of the argument be thought frivolous, one need only recall the invaluable work of R. A. Sayce along similar lines, the complexities of clandestine printing on the Continent, and the high proportion of Continental workmen in the English printing trades in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. 3 We need not, however, rely wholly upon French manuals in search of a 'rationale'. John Smith's The Printer's Grammar (1755) is the first in English to be explicit, suggesting an en-quadrat after a comma, semicolon, etc., and an em-quadrat after a full point. He calls such practice a 'rule' but quickly adds 'it is no law neither' (p. 113) and offers some golden advice on the relation between the spacing of punctuation and the troublesome business of justification: 'putting nothing at all after a Comma, Semicolon, or even after a Full-point, in composing, shews more readily [towards the close of a line] how much more or less may be taken in; and what space may be allowed after a Point or Points in a line' (p. 114). The thought may be fanciful, but that remark rings true and suggests to me a trick of the trade of proven worth and real antiquity. Normally of course a line would be regularly spaced until it was almost full, and then modified to fit. The practice Smith describes would make the spacing more contingent. Writing of word-spacing, he says that 'most Compositors chuse to put a thick Space, called The Composing Space , after a word' but adds that this practice makes the lines less easy to justify: '. . . therefore those who put Spaces as they come up, have a better chance to justify the contents of their lines to equal distances.' 4 Justification is one concern, correction (as Fertel implies) another. Smith ingeniously suggests a way of making both problems easier: if all punctuation were cast to a uniform thickness, it could be changed without rejustifying the line. It would also save spaces, for punctuation cast centrally on bodies of uniform size would, when printed, appear to be spaced. He goes on: Even the Comma (we presume) is not under the necessity to clinge to the Matter so close as it always does, in England; considering that all other Printing Nations make it a law to put at least a thin Space before it, lest it should seem that the Comma is govern'd by particular words; whereas its proper function is, to inform the Reader, that a Stop, Rest, or Pause of the shortest duration is to be observed between word and word where the Comma shews itself. That this is the tenor of this observation with the French, appears from their putting as much space before as after a Comma; and in very open lines they put a thin Space even before a Full point. (p. 101). Smith's mid-century suggestion, we might note, together with Fertel's and Bertrand-Quinquet's explicit directions, indicate that spaces before and after punctuation marks must have been separately set, not cast on the body. This was certainly so in type set in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and still standing at the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp. 5 Thus documented, the trade's attitudes to the spacing of punctuation are seen to be related to several different practical concerns. Bertrand-Quinquet's authority supports and extends the general theory that compositors may be distinguished from one another by the ways in which they space such marks; both Fertel and Smith offer sound advice (though in different forms) about setting and using space on either side of punctuation marks to justify or correct a line more easily. They do not, however, offer a 'rationale'. Bertrand-Quinquet shows a faith perhaps too touching in the efficacy of education, forgivable though that might be in Year Seven of a new dispensation. Fertel and Smith complicate matters a little by recommending practices which would obscure a presumed pattern. In sum, however, their comments reinforce the idea that any one compositor should and would have a practice of his own, and his companions perhaps different ones, and that in a book where the practices seemed to differ from one another, those compositors might be separated out. The status of our inferences, if they are not to derive only from a simple juxtaposition of the extremities of the evidence, depends crucially of course upon which of several possible motivations and methods we select to make sense of our analysis, and also upon the extent to which we can define the limits of identity and discount correspondence. Unfortunately, the theory by definition functions only where the distinctions are in fact extreme, and it collapses into complete inutility at mid-point, where the evidence of distinction declines into spasmodic eccentricity or disappears altogether. Nor is that inutility simply a regrettable inadequacy: it is profoundly subversive of the whole theory. For a theory can hardly be thought sound which predicts one way (division) but not the other (integrity). So, if it anywhere fails to predict (that is, confirm the hunch . . .) that work was or was not divided; or if it fails to accord with the facts as soundly established by other evidence; then, logically at least, even the statistically impressive figures of difference cannot be trusted either. They appear significant only by virtue of the simple assumptions we bring to them, and they appear deceptively attractive because we find it easier to divide than unify. Such a preamble presupposes a case which proves (i.e. tests) the rule, and disproves (i.e. falsifies) it. The one I offer has involved, in a very literal sense, much soul-searching, for the book is the second, revised edition of Joseph Beaumont's Psyche , a folio in fours printed at the Cambridge University Press in 1701-2. The work is a long one in 24 cantos, set in Pica roman, double column, with eighteen stanzas per page. Semicolons, colons, question and exclamation marks almost invariably have a space before them (see Fertel's comment above on 'le point-virgule'), but the practice with commas, of which the following illustrations are typical examples, varies in statistically significant numbers. Such features can be readily seen in other books also set in Pica roman and printed at the Press in 1701-2: Thomas Bennet's A Confutation of Popery ; the second, reset edition of the same work; and the second, reset edition of his Answer to the Dissenters Pleas . In each, spaced commas appear throughout the text. William Whiston's A Short View of the Chronology of the Old Testament (1702), also set in Pica, has none; but in The Harmony of the Four Evangelists included with it, spaced commas appear in the extensive sections set in Long Primer. In all cases, the compositors and pressmen are reliably known from their personal claims for payment, claims which specify the work units (half-forme, forme, sheet, quire). The function, variety, dating, and range of men involved, inhibit the entertainment of any conspiracy theory, whether to defraud the Press or mislead future scholars, and their evidence is still extant and examinable in the Cambridge University Archives. Drawing inferences of the kind which mark the use of spaced commas to track compositors in Shakespearian texts (though the assumptions underlying such inferences have not I think been made clear), one would come up with wholly respectable results. For the 224 pages in the quires examined (A-2E), there are, plus or minus perhaps 2 per cent, 13,777 commas, or an average of 61.5 commas per page. A glance at the appended table will show an unmistakable and statistically acceptable distinction between pages in which the ratio of unspaced to spaced commas varies between 120:0 and 64:14 (say 4.6:1), and those in which spaced commas equal or outnumber the others in ratios varying from 27:27 (or 1:1 to 8:60 (or 1:7.5). As the text is in verse, justification is not often a factor; as it is a revised reprint of the 1648 edition which has no such pre-spaced commas, copy-influence can be discounted. The theory, cautiously applied, might then support either of two propositions: (a) that two men were involved, one who scarcely ever set a space before a comma, and another who did so more often than not; (b) that two groups of compositors were involved, one of which could not be further divided by this test. A third proposition, however, will doubtless occur to those who accept the second: (c) that while the common habits of one group disguise their separate identities, the second group might certainly be further sub-divided (within statistically reliable limits) by gradations in the incidence of spaced commas (the statistics tolerating distinctions within the seven-fold difference between 1:1 and 1:7.5). In the latter case, some fine distinctions would undoubtedly remain to be made at border-line points, but the success which has attended the resolution of such problems in the Shakespeare First Folio gives excellent grounds for thinking they could be resolved here too. Some sixty years ago Thomas Satchell settled for A and B; by a simple but exacting process of sub-division, they have now been splintered into no fewer than nine different men. With little fear that we run counter to current assumptions and scholarly practice, we may however settle for proposition (a) while conceding, with a proper openness to fresh evidence, that the compositor who set spaces before commas might yet turn out to be one of twins or triplets. With that proviso then we may reasonably infer that the same compositor set the following pages, but no others, in this book: D1, D3v, D4 E1, E3v, E4 F2v-F3, F4 G2, G3, G4v H2v-H3, H4 I1-I4v, I2v-I3 K2v-K3, K4v L1, L2v-L3 P1, P1v, P2 Q1, Q1v U3, U4 X2, X3 Y2, Y4 Z1, Z3v 2A2 The pattern is itself seductively attractive: three pages in each of nine consecutive formes (with a hiccup in I), then a decline into two pages only in the last few before the compositor takes leave of the entire book with one page only in 2A. It must be conceded, however, that the inclusion of certain pages in the above list is questionable: E4, U3, X2, X3, Z3v, 2A2, for example, have only between 16 and 19 spaced commas each (exact figures are given in the appendix). Nevertheless, as a clear case of a slightly imbalanced composition: presswork ratio it will certainly support a complementary theory of concurrent printing to keep our less productive man occupied. Bennet's three books could be claimed to show the same compositor at work on those texts, and quite independent proof that one of them was indeed in exactly concurrent production sustains the inference. One other element in our analysis may lead us to complicate the theory. I refer to the concurrent use, through the quires examined, of four skeleton-formes. These are often evidenced to buttress a theory of divided work, on the further theory that, if work was divided, the press-crew would need to save as much time as possible to keep up with the increased rate of setting. Or, were there not such clear evidence of two men, we might posit a larger edition than normal as another explanation of this time-saving practice of using several skeletons. In this case, however, we have independent proof that the edition numbered only 750, a figure which happily reinforces our inference from skeleton-formes that the setting must have been shared. It is rare of course to be able to establish so easily and indubitably the exactly concurrent printing of another book with matching features and a firm figure for the press-run. It would have been too much perhaps to hope for an exact correlation between a particular skeleton-forme and a particular compositor. A recurrent skeleton might then have allowed us to corroborate the theory that, under certain circumstances, a skeleton might substantiate the man; but the subordinate role of the one who spaced his commas in Psyche (one-and-a-half formes per quire) really—and reasonably —rules that out. At best, we might explore the significance of his setting both pages of the same forme in F2(i), H2(i), I1(o), I2(i), K2(i) and L2(i), but the other 27 pages give strong evidence of shared setting as the norm in each forme when a second compositor was involved. I leave it to the appended details to collapse this house of cards. Here I need only observe that the pattern of spaced commas has no significant relation to division of work among the compositors. Six different men worked on the book and they rarely shared a quire, let alone a forme. Four of them (Bertram, Crownfield, Délié and Michaëlis: English, Dutch, French-via-Oxford, German?), each set some pages with very high, and other pages with very low, ratios of unspaced to spaced commas. The statistics are impeccable; the assumptions, and therefore the inferences, are nonsense. As a question of logic, it matters not that compositors in 1600 or 1623 did or did not set spaces after commas instead of before them. Nor can this challenge to the theory be respectably met merely by affirming that 1701 is not 1623 or that Cambridge is not London. The case for the efficacy of a modified theory, reliable for London shops in 1600 or 1623, positing different conditions, motivations and methods, must be rigorously argued as a matter of history and meet the appropriate standards of historical scholarship. The point was made some years ago but it is probably worth stressing once again: there is no relationship of an easily statable kind between compositors, skeleton-formes and press-crews. The formes for Psyche as a whole were printed by six different pressmen in eight different combinations including, on three separate occasions, work at half-press. For all that, I must strongly and explicitly affirm the importance of such theories—and affirm also the most exhaustive testing of them as an essential complement to their entertainment. Our scholarship is deficient, not in the formulation of interesting hypotheses, but in our failure to test them rigorously, and in the superimposition of one fragile theory upon another, as if two crutches gave us healthy legs. In that spirit, therefore, let me before I close propose another theory. It is this: notwithstanding the date of Smith's comments on a uniform size of body for punctuation marks, or Fertel's and Bertrand-Quinquet's earlier and later assumptions of compositorial free will, the Cambridge University Press (unusually for 1701-2) might have had a fount of Pica roman which contained a high proportion of punctuation with cast-on spaces. We see it travelling from quire to quire as it was set, distributed, and reset. This theory accounts for its recurrences, its successive use by four different men in the same book, and its concurrent use in others. Taken no further that theory might well salvage some of the others. In testing it, however, we have at once to confront the absence of historical evidence for such a practice at such a date. The Plantin exhibits show independent spacing before commas, although the Cambridge type, it is true, came from Amsterdam. A new and therefore perhaps distinctive fount of type did reach Cambridge from London on 28 March 1701 and Clement Knell was paid for papering and filling two pair of Pica cases on 17 May 1701, a date which neatly coincides with the start of work on Psyche . Yet more evidence, however, shows that it would be wrong to conclude that this new fount contained spaced commas. In the first place, they are extremely rare in Psyche before quire D (claimed on 21 July 1701); in the second place, such new types would not have been discarded as early as quire 2A (set by 30 August 1701). Finally and conclusively, such spaced commas had already appeared in two books set in Pica roman and printed the year before. So let's try another theory: the fount containing spaced commas was an old one and was discarded once the new fount had been brought into effective use. Whiston's A Short Chronology may be invoked to support this line of argument, for there are no spaced commas in the main text of this later book which is set in Pica roman. But since external evidence proves that the fount thought to contain spaced commas was no more than two or three years old and had had little use, we must abandon that explanation too. Perhaps then only the spaced commas were discarded—although they survive in the Long Primer of Whiston's Harmony set in 1702. If that were so, the new theory of punctuation with cast-on spaces might be saved and a contribution offered to the history of typefounding (Moxon, for example, has no mention of the practice in his section on typecasting). Let's pursue this form of the theory a little further. It assumes (a) that pre-spaced commas were cast as such; (b) that they formed a distinctive element in at least one pair of cases; (c) that their presence in the text proper was in fact anomalous; (d) that they had a different typographic function which we have still to explain; (e) that after quire P they were gradually segregated and removed from the fount until, by quire 2B, it was wholly cleansed of them. We have now to specify a function: the spaced commas, let us say, were so cast specifically for use with small caps but had been dissed into one lower case, either mistakenly or to make good a deficiency. Fertel's discussion of the spacing of caps and small caps is suggestive: Quand [le compositeur] se rencontre des mots de lettres capitales dans la matiere de l'ouvrage, comme JESUS, MARIA, ou autres semblables noms, qu'un Auteur souhaite de distinguer, on doit mettre une grosse ou fine espace entre chaque lettre, &amp; cela a beaucoup plus d'agrément; pour les petites Capitales, il n'est point nécessaire d'y en mettre lors qu'elles portent leur blanc, par l'épaisseur du corps ; c'est ce qui arrive souvent à plusieurs fontes. (p. 17; my italics). But before we can accept that Fertel has led us at last to an incontrovertible theory, we must in all honesty note that the passage just cited makes no mention at all of punctuation, and that bills of fount treat caps, small caps, lower case, punctuation, and figures as discrete categories. More seriously, we must note further that the spacing of the prespaced commas is not uniform as we should expect it to be if it had in fact been pre-cast. That objection might, of course, be met by compounding a theory of distinctive types with one of compositorial practice: the cast-on space was a fine one and might be variously expanded by the addition of others as need arose in justifying, correcting, or merely as the mood took each of Bertram, Crownfield, Délié or Michaëlis. But now Whitehead's admonition, so respected by Greg, bursts through: 'seek simplicity—and distrust it'. The theory of cast-on spacing cannot be quite trusted, and any theory of compositorial practice (given the four compositors and the extreme variations within the work of each) returns us to the initial problem—why such distinctive groupings in such a regularly recurrent pattern? Which is also to say that we are indeed back where we started: in a cleft stick. Lest it lead me into self-parody then, let me formally abandon even my own theory of commas with cast-on spaces. It is possibly unhistorical, and in any case it would have been seriously damaging to proposition two: if such distinctive types from the same pair of cases recurred with such well-defined regularity, it would have been reasonable—or at least orthodox—to suppose that they had been set by the same compositor from 'his' cases; and that, demonstrably, was not so. I was tempted to call this paper 'Amoebic Scholarship: Or, The Counsels of Duessa?' because I believe that there is a question of deeper principle to be faced, and perhaps also a moral issue in how best we should spend our bibliographical time and space. The deeper principle relates of course to our use of division as a function of analysis. Evidence of difference is observable and countable; by contrast, what is common or coherent is thought to be inert and uninformative. The computer, which is becoming indispensable in the service of such analyses, is the child—indeed, the supreme expression—of the binary system. Its virtue lies in the separation of sheep from goats, of chalk from cheese. If it finds it harder to tell the difference between scholarship and pseudo-scholarship, that deficiency we must attribute to our own inability to teach it. 6 Is it then altogether surprising that the same two 'compositors' should have been divided into three, then five, then six, then nine? Or that a refined eye for linguistic distinctions, and a superior technical facility to store and report them, should now lead to a revival of disintegrationalist theories of divided authorship? Or that observed differences between two substantive texts should, within the parameters of each, be offered as evidence of inviolably distinct structures whose division into two their conflation would destroy? Or, where the structures seem inconveniently interlocked, that the 'text' should be divided yet again by the ingenious invocation of an intermediate (but lost) manuscript to create a third (or fourth, or fifth . . .) structural unit into which one might syphon off inconsistent evidence? The formalities of such analyses, but especially the limited assumptions that underlie them, are quite inadequate to the diversity of the human behaviour which created the 'evidence'. Yet the paucity of reliable historical evidence makes it difficult to improve them. More ominously, however, such procedures threaten to redefine bibliography as an essentially dis junctive tool and to distract us from the greater challenge to discern the unity in human variability. ('Two Distincts, Division none'—Shakespeare's own succinct statement of one of Love's mysteries—is not without a certain admonitory force here.) Having used that phrase 'human variability' I must add that I should be sorry if it became a license for relaxing the rules of evidence in bibliography, any more than it might in a court of law. The pressure to prove our theories (again, that is, to test them rigorously) by what is historically knowable must in no way slacken. A theory which collapses from book to book, like a chain with broken links, is nowhere sound. In the present instance, the forms of two theories (rarely I confess so nakedly exposed) have been stripped and shown as impotent to explain what actually happened in printing just one book used to test them: spacing as a compositorial practice, and founts as a compositorial trace. Even their skeletons are uninformative. Statistics merely compound the errors. And, most damning of all, it is perfectly clear as a matter of fact and of logic that, far from one theory assisting the other where either is weak, the two theories in this case are mutually exclusive. My anatomy of Beaumont's Psyche is now concluded. I assure the reader that 'no levell'd malice Infects one comma in the course I hold'. But since it takes courage to make a fool of oneself by counting 13,777 commas in public, I can only hope that this example may serve as at least a caution to others doing likewise in their pious efforts to discover how many comps can dance on the point of a bodkin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX Beaumont's Psyche (1702): A Case-Study Loves mysteries in soules doe grow, But yet the body is his booke. Psyche, or Love's Mystery, in XXIV. Cantos: Displaying the Intercourse Betwixt Christ, and the Soul. . . . By Joseph Beaumont, D.D. . . . The Second Edition, With Corrections throughout, and Four New Cantos, never before Printed . Cambridge, Printed at the University Press, for Tho. Bennet, at the Half Moon in St. Paul's Church Yard, London, M.DCCII. Collation: 2 : a-b 4 A-2Z 4 3A 2 . For a detailed description and production tables, see The Cambridge University Press 1696-1712: A Bibliographical Study . 2 vols. Cambridge: at the University Press, 1966, i. 219-221. The compositors' and pressmen's claims are reproduced in extenso (and indexed) in vol. ii. Briefly, as the collation shows, the book is a folio in fours comprising 101 sheets. With a text of 6-line verse stanzas in Pica roman fitting 18 to a page, double column, it would have been easy to cast off and set by formes. Composition was shared serially by six men. The sheets were printed off by six different men working in eight different combinations. The book was about 40 weeks printing—from May 1701 to February 1702. The edition was 750 copies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Composition When work was occasionally divided within a quire, the records do not specify precisely which pages or formes were set by which compositor. Michaëlis left the Press sometime after 19 July 1701, the date of his last claim: it is probable that he set N-O and Q½ before departing. Quire D was claimed by both Bertram and Crownfield: it is here given to Bertram. Otherwise the composition was shared as follows: Crownfield: A¼, C½, G½ - I, P - Q½, X, 2D, 2G - 2I, 2Q½ - 2T½ Bertram: A¼, B - C½, D - G½, T - U, Y - Z, 2E - 2F, 2K - 2Q½, 2T½ - 3A, a - b Knell: A½ Délié: R - S, 2A - 2B Michaëlis: K - M, [N - O, Q½] Muckeus: 2C</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Presswork The earliest presswork voucher is datable as 26 June 1701, the last is dated 28 February 1702. See The Cambridge University Press , i. 126 n. 3 and 127 for an analysis and discussion of the skeleton-formes and the validity of inferring compositorial stints, or the number of presses used, from the number or pattern of skeleton-formes. It is probable that there were three actual printing presses in alternate and/or concurrent use during the printing of Psyche ; a fourth was put into working order in January 1702. The only doubtful claim relates to 2S½ which was claimed both by Coldenhoff and Ponder and by Brown and Terrill. As Terrill was not using a press-figure in this book it is impossible to confirm his claim. It is here presumed to be a slip by Coldenhoff and Ponder for 2T½, otherwise unclaimed.

      <field name="fulltext">Unspaced : Spaced Commas The count is limited to the first 27 quires as spaced commas virtually disappear altogether from the book after quire 2A. Unless there is no doubt at all, commas after 'w' and 'y', sometimes after 'f' and 'r' and certain italic letters, have been conservatively classified as unspaced since they naturally appear to stand apart from the face (if not the body) of the previous letter. The counts have been spot-checked and found accurate to within about 2 per cent.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 T. H. Howard-Hill, in Compositors B and E in the Shakespeare First Folio and Some Recent Studies (Columbia, S.C., 1976) and in "The Compositors of Shakespeare's Folio Comedies," Studies in Bibliography , 26 (1973), 61-106, used evidence of "compositors' various habits of spacing after commas in short lines, and at the end of lines." He had earlier applied such a test in "Ralph Crane and five Shakespearian First Folio comedies," D.Phil. thesis, Oxford University, 1970. Gary Taylor, "The Shrinking Compositor A of the Shakespeare First Folio," SB , 34 (1981), 96-117, describes terminal spaced commas as a 'near-infallible indicator' of compositor C at one point. MacD. P. Jackson, "Two Shakespeare Quartos: Richard III (1597) and I Henry IV (1598)," SB , 35 (1982), 173-190, also uses their evidence. I must in fairness to those writers absolve them at once from any imputation of having reduced their own practice to tests as simple and unsupported as my formulation of the two propositions might suggest. Without committing them in any way to my general argument, I should like to record my gratitude to several friends from whom I sought informed comment on historical aspects of the present article. I think particularly of Nicolas Barker, Peter Blayney, Philip Gaskell, Lotte Hellinga, Mervyn Jannetta, David McKitterick, James Mosley and David Shaw. 2 J.D. Fleeman examined printers' widows for signs of correction in a not unrelated way: see "Concealed Proofs and the Editor," Studies in the Eighteenth Century , ed. R. F. Brissenden and J. C. Eade (Canberra, 1979), 207-221. A Dutch printing manual of the late eighteenth century, David Wardenaar's, Beschrijving der Boekdrukkunst , also refers to the spacing of punctuation and its advantages when correcting: see Zetten en Drukken in De Achttiende Eeuw , ed. Frans A. Janssen (Haarlem, 1982), pp. 323, 378-379. 3 See R. A. Sayce, Compositorial Practices and the Localization of Printed Books 1530-1800 . Occasional Publications No. 13 (Oxford Bibliographical Society, 1979); and Robert Darnton's work on surreptitious printing and publishing in "Un commerce de livres 'sous le manteau' en Province à la fin de l'Ancien Régime," Revue française de l'histoire du livre , n.s. 9 (1975), 5-29; "L'imprimerie de Pancoucke en l'An II," ibid. , n.s. 23 (1979), 359-369; as well as in The Business of Enlightenment: A Publishing History of the 'Encyclopédie', 1775-1800 (1979). 4 'Spaces as they come up': see Philip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography (rev. ed., 1979), p. 46: 'nowhere during the hand-press period were spaces of different widths kept apart in separate boxes of the case'. 5 Howard-Hill, "The Compositors of Shakespeare's Folio Comedies," p. 66, notes: "If there were reason to doubt this [i.e. that a space did or did not follow a comma], perhaps on the ground that different sorts were irregularly centered on the body of the type, the instances of inked spaces and quads . . . would confirm that internal spacing in short lines is a real and not an imaginary phenomenon." 6 The comments of two distinguished computer scientists are not impertinent. See John Von Neumann, 'Can We Survive Technology?', Fortune , June 1955. One point made by Von Neumann is that computer technology is prodigiously generative: instead of performing the same tasks in less time, we now perform more in the same time. Computer output therefore rapidly pre-empts space; a wrong programme (i.e. a mistaken assumption in the programme) will, with a mad logic, be more prodigal of error; and that prodigality crowds out the more severely disciplined evidence of other kinds of analysis. Massed statistics might therefore be seen as an ominous symptom. One is reminded of the story of the Staff Officer who, when promised another man for his unit, replied: 'Send me one who is brilliant and energetic. If you can't do that, send me one who is brilliant and lazy. If you can't do that, send me one who is stupid and lazy. But for God's sake don't send me one who is stupid and energetic.' Joseph Weizenbaum's Computer Power and Human Reason (1976), is also highly relevant here.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The London Thornton Manuscript: A Corrected Collation by Ralph Hanna III</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In two very important notes, Sarah M. Horrall has advanced considerably our knowledge of the construction of Robert Thornton's two miscellanies, Lincoln Cathedral MS. 91 and British Library MS. Additional 31042. 1 Horrall carefully describes all the watermarks of the two codices; by matching watermarked and unwatermarked halves of Thornton's sheets, folded in folio, she can provide a collation of the British Library manuscript. This collation will be the basis for any further codicological understanding of the manuscript, for the pages are now mounted individually. In most respects, Horrall's collation is beyond fault and an important contribution. But I do not believe that it is entirely correct. In suggesting improvements, I hope to shed some light on two mistaken assumptions which Horrall is not alone in making about the composition of English literary manuscripts. Horrall divides Additional 31042 into thirteen codicological units, not all of which she is sure represent quires. Her collation runs: 1 ? (ff. 3-8, the fragmentary end of a quire) 2 24 (ff. 9-32) 3 22 (—22; ff. 33-53) 4 20 (ff. 54-73) 5 10? (—5, —8; ff. 74-81) 6 18? (—17; ff. 82-97, only 16 leaves) 7 4 (ff. 98-101) 8 10 (—2; ff. 102-10) 9 ? (—1, —2; ff. 111-19) 10 ? (ff. 120-24) 11 22 + 1 ; (—20, —21, —22, +23; ff. 125-44) 12 24 (ff. 145-68) 13 18 (—14, —15, —16, —17, —18; ff. 169-81). 2 No one, I should think, will quibble with Horrall's reconstruction of the greater part of the manuscript: certainly, the results appear clearcut and sensible for ff. 3-73 and 125-81. More problematic is the fifty-odd folio gap separating these portions of Additional 31042, where Horrall's collation shows a variety of small clumps of folios and numerous authorial questionmarks. At least three considerations, apart from Horrall's own illease, should make one hesitate at this point, I think. First, the six units into which Horrall divides ff. 74-124 are largely animated by the texts these folios contain, rather than by any codicological information. Second, with the exception of a fleeting glance in a footnote, Horrall ignores the emphatic and unequivocal codicological information she has so carefully unearthed. 3 And third, the resulting disposition of parts does not savor strongly of the behavior, as we know it, of the compiler-scribe Robert Thornton. Horrall's six textual units contain only one quire (number 6) which at all resembles a usual Thornton product. This Yorkshire gentryman 4 is renowned for the sheer size of his textual units: for example, in the Lincoln MS., quires 15 and 16 contain 30 and 36 (perhaps originally 40!) leaves respectively. In fact, taking only units which are certainly quires into account, Thornton never copied in a format smaller than 16 folia (quires 4, 6, and 10 of the Lincoln ms.). Elsewhere in Additional 31042, Horrall's quires conform to Thornton's expected norms: quire size is not consistent but approximate, usually 22 or 24 folios. 5 In this context, Horrall's questionmarks are surely merited, for, without more extensive bibliographical data than she chooses to utilize, there is only a minimal likelihood that Thornton constructed the manuscript in the way she suggests. Moreover, Horrall's reconstruction ignores, in ff. 74-124, such bibliographical evidence as the manuscript provides. Horrall routinely pairs leaves bearing watermarks and leaves without them; since the quires of the manuscript have been constructed by folding in folio, one watermarked and one unwatermarked leaf comprise a full sheet. But Horrall fails to note a very important corollary to this procedure: since watermarks are imposed symmetrically on sheets during manufacture, when sheets are folded to form a quire, they will show symmetrical patterns of watermarked and unwatermarked leaves within the quire. Thus, even without knowing quire boundaries, symmetrical patterning of marked and unmarked leaves generally provides evidence for at least a portion of a quire. 6 Hence, such features as a series of five successive watermarked leaves (ff. 104-108) and a series of five successive unwatermarked ones (ff. 111-115) surely suggest the presence of a single quire, rather than Horrall's two quires, in this part of the manuscript. Horrall ignores her evidence here and elsewhere because she believes she has a better way to recognize quire boundaries. She rejects information provided by watermarks in favor of what is known about the scribe's practice from the Lincoln MS.; there Thornton prepared his texts in fascicular units, small booklets usually composed of several quires. 7 Horrall assumes this discovery will also aid in determining the collation of the London MS. and attempts to pinpoint those folios which are likely to have stood at the end of fascicles (and thus of quires). Her effort is laudable, for the London ms. is very likely fascicular; but the attempt remains unconvincing because of Horrall's assumptions about how fascicle boundaries are to be identified. Inherent in Horrall's argument is the belief that all folio junctures where the verso concludes with a series of short texts and the recto begins with a new and substantial text are likely to be fascicle (and thus quire) boundaries. While such a situation is surely typical of fascicular manuscripts generally, it is not necessarily the case that the situation uniquely typifies the fascicle: some scribes simply prefer to begin new texts at the top of rectos and fill in intervening blank leaves with short materials. 8 In brief, Horrall has exchanged a powerful tool, symmetry of watermarks, for a dubious one, the disposition of texts; this error, when joined with the un Thornton-like collation she produces, renders her findings unconvincing. One does better, then, to return to the incontrovertible codicological evidence. If one looks at a sequence of leaves and their watermarks, one can see very quickly that the marks form a symmetrical pattern. I give demonstrably lost folia in brackets 9 and place a letter, Horrall's identification of the watermark, above the number of those folia bearing watermarks: G G G G G G [102a] 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 / G 117 116 115 114 113 112 111 [110b] [110a] In the form I present the information, I hope to make clear that this sequence of leaves represents an 18-leaf quire, with its center at "/." If one reads the diagram vertically, each pair of folio numbers represents the two halves of an originally conjoint bifolium. In Robert Thornton's folio folding of large paper sheets, the watermark appears on only half the leaf, and thus ff. 103 + 116, 104 + 115, 105 + 114, 106 + 113, 107 + 112, and 108 + 111 form full sheets. By inference, ff. 110 + 110a were a full sheet, the lost leaf without watermark, and presumably ff. 102a + 117 and 109 + 110b were full sheets with watermarks on the lost halves of the bifolia. The probability that ff. 103-117 represent a quire (an 18, lacking leaves 1, 10, and 11) is increased by the infrequency of this paper stock. It appears in Thornton's work only here, in fourteen or fifteen sheets of quires 7 and 15 of the Lincoln ms., and in the adjacent ff. 118 and 119 of this manuscript. One can demonstrate rather easily that these adjacent leaves cannot be part of the same quire as ff. 103-117. If one redraws the diagram above to include them, the results will not produce coherent full sheets: G G G G G [102a] 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 [110a] G G G 119 118 117 116 115 114 113 112 111 [110b] One putative sheet (ff. 105 + 116) bears two watermarks and two others (ff. 109 + 112, 110 + 111) have none. This represents a less plausible possibility and should be rejected. 10 If one identifies ff. 103-117 as a quire, one immediately must deal with a small piece of text: G G E E 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 Here there is an odd number of leaves, but the watermarks show a symmetry of sequence reminiscent of the much larger quire just surveyed: G G E 118 119 120 / E 124 123 122 121 The folia appear to represent a six-leaf quire with an added singleton. This is, as I've argued before, far smaller than Thornton's normal quires and thus anomalous; it may be acceptable here as marking the end of a fascicle, an originally selfsubstantial series of quires. But more probably, the leaves represent only a piece of a quire with an indeterminate number of folia at the end cancelled. In that case, the smallest possible quire would be a 14, with f. 124 the seventh leaf. This possibility, especially given ultimate position in a fascicle, gains support from cancellation of leaves at the ends of fascicles in the Lincoln ms., quires 3 (leaves 11-18 cancelled) and 10 (leaf 16 cancelled). If one turns to the head of this section of Additional 31042, another more or less symmetrical series of watermarks occurs (here Z is an unidentified mark unique to f. 90): E E E E F F F 74 75 76 77 [77a] 78 79 [79a] 80 81 82 83 84/ E Z F F [96a] 96 95 94 93 92 91 90 89 88 87 86 85 Particularly important signs of symmetry are the F sheets (ff. 80-89, split by Horrall between two quires) and, surrounding them, the succession of four unwatermarked leaves (ff. 91-94) balanced by three watermarked leaves and a lost one (ff. 77-79). The diagram above identifies eleven full sheets, nine certain and two putative. Ff. 76 + 95, 77 + 94, 78 + 92, 79 + 91 represent full sheets of Horrall's stock E; ff. 80 + 89, 81 + 88, 82 + 87, 83 + 86, 84 + 85 are full sheets of Horrall's stock F. Folios 74 + 96a presumably formed a full sheet of stock E and ff. 79a + 90 of the unidentified stock. One must assume that ff. 77a + 93 were also such a full sheet, watermarked (with E?) on the lost f. 77a, and there remains the apparent anomaly of ff. 75 + 96, which bear no watermark. This anomaly is, however, only apparent. For among the numerous paper stocks which Thornton utilized in his two manuscripts, there were at least a few sheets which lacked any watermark. Three examples, unnoted by Horrall, appear in the Lincoln ms. in clearly defined quires where they are still bifolia: ff. 51 + 52 (now singletons), 108 + 117, 296 + 299. If Thornton did have such sheets, and if he did use them occasionally, one can identify ff. 75 + 96 as the unique such example in Additional 31042. That identification allows one to group ff. 74-96 as representing a typically large Thornton quire—26 leaves, lacking 5, 8, and 26. But the quire typifies Thornton's work in yet another way—in its mixture of papers and in the confirmation of that mixture. The center four bifolia represent a paper stock different from that of the majority of the leaves, which forms the outer sheets of the quire. This phenomenon occurs with some frequency in Thornton texts. Elsewhere in Additional 31042, quire 4 has three bifolia at its center of a different stock (Horrall's D) from the remainder of the quire (Horrall's C, with one odd sheet). In the Lincoln ms. the phenomenon is more frequent: for example, there are two odd bifolia at the center of quire 1, three at the center of quire 2, three at the center of quire 5, three (of two different stocks) at the center of quire 7. 11 These fitful changes of paper stock suggest a mode of composing a codex which Thornton took as a given but which modern scholars generally consider an outre aberration. The example of Thornton, I think, forces one to consider whether the usual assumption of the singly-folded quire, in which a scribe selects a given format in advance and retains it, represents a universal model. The example of Thornton, which can be multiplied by several other English cases, suggests another model, in which a quire may represent something more than a single folding of sheets. 12 That is, Thornton frequently appears to have supplemented his quires from their centers. Having begun copying with a certain stock of paper folded in folio, he at times increased his working space and his quire size by inserting separately folded bifolia into the center of his quire. 13 Such a procedure would be sensible for a compiler in Thornton's position. He obviously had, over a space of years, access on a fitful and perhaps limited basis (probably through loans) to a variety of manuscript sources. Moreover, the kinds of miscellanies Thornton could have borrowed would always have contained surprises: he could never be certain he would not, in the pursuit of text A, accidentally find a new literary text B which he would want to make his own by copying. But Thornton, if one judges his final product, also appears to have been reasonably methodical: although he had a remarkably catholic taste, the completed manuscripts fall into fairly precise arrangements by category, romances with other romances, for example. One method of facilitating this categorization would be to have several fascicular manuscripts in progress simultaneously. And, as a way of accommodating unexpected but desired texts, Thornton seems to have made room in fascicles already in progress by suppletion, by adding extra center bifolia, rather than by making new quires. 14 Recognition of this possibility also shows Thornton's quiring in a new light. Although he is generally thought of as rather sloppy, simply grabbing a (large to very large) handful of sheets, folding them, and filling them, the evidence of the paper stocks is a little different. If one looks upon many of the mixed-stock quires as in fact supplemented after an initial folding, Thornton's procedures appear much more normal. He typically began with eight or nine full sheets, a fairly consistent and normal quire size; only by chance additions and later foldings of further sheets did many quires achieve their current uneven and bulky appearance. 15 If these arguments are convincing, there are only six further leaves with which to deal, ff. 97-102. These leaves will prove somewhat more problematic than any of the preceding: E E E E 97 98 99 100 101 102 Ff. 98 + 101 and 99 + 100 can be taken as conjoint and from the same sheet. But ff. 97 and 102, each with watermark, cannot represent halves of the same sheet. They may provide an example, unique in Thornton's two manuscripts, of half-sheet imposition, perhaps the result of a cancel. 16 But there are other possibilities, at least one of which also explains the smallness of this quire. One must face the possibility that the quire is substantially incomplete. Horrall assumes, properly as an initial effort, that only one leaf, the twenty-sixth and last of the preceding quire, has been lost after f. 96. Her argument appears to have considerable merit, for she demonstrates that the materials missing at this point could have filled a single leaf. F. 96 contains Lydgate's "Kings of England" (IMEV 3632) but breaks off in midstanza and lacks lines 61-105, while f. 97 begins at line 18 of Lydgate's "Dietary" (IMEV 824). These missing pieces of text, says Horrall, provide "exactly the right number of lines to fill one manuscript folio." But three objections can be lodged against this argument. First, in spite of Horrall's assertion, the missing sixty-two lines are not "exactly the right number" to fill a missing leaf. Thornton, who varies a good deal in the number of lines per page, is averaging in this portion of the codex about seventy-six lines to the folio, and the missing material represents substantially less than a folio. There is thus no assurance that f. 96a contained both the end of "Kings" and the opening of "Dietary"; these texts almost certainly occupied separate folios, with some intervening and unrecoverable text. Moreover, Horrall does not take into account other possible losses within the folios under discussion. One cannot definitively state that no folio is missing after f. 97. Although f. 97 v clearly is loaded with filler, given that the four lines of poetry at the page foot (IMEV 3778) are unique, one cannot assert absolutely that they form a complete poem. Further, the subsequent quire 7 opened with a leaf now lost, and the text at the end of quire 6 is incomplete—and again unique (IMEV 990). Thus one cannot be absolutely certain whether a number of folios, rather than only a single one, may be missing after f. 102. Following this reasoning, the diagram for these folios given above needs to be redrawn. But such a redepiction has to acknowledge substantial indeterminacy: E E E E (. . . [96n]?) 97 ([97a]?) 98 99 100 101 102 (. . . [102n]?) If Lydgate's "Kings" ended on f. 96a and that folio did not bear the opening lines of the "Dietary," one cannot be certain how many folios or how many texts have been lost in this section of the codex. If one assumes that no folio has been lost after f. 97 and only one after f. 102, the minimum quire under examination would be an 8 (lacking ff. 1 and 2) with ff. 97 + 100 and 98 + 99 surviving full bifolia. If one assumes that a single leaf is gone after both ff. 97 and 102, the minimum quire would be a 12 (lacking ff. 1-5) with no surviving full bifolia. And if more than one leaf has disappeared after f. 102, the number of possible original quire sizes increases. One can represent the minimum quires in the simplest cases, with two folios lost after f. 102 (one at the head of the next quire): E (a) [96b] [96c] [96d] 97 98 / E E E [102b] 102 101 100 99 E (b) [96b] [96c] [96d] [96e] [96f] [96g] 97 / E E E [102b] 102 101 100 99 98 [97a] Obviously the quire may have been far larger than a 10 or a 14, but the essential point remains the same: very likely, too few folios here survive to make any definitive judgement about the original status of the quire. 17 Having identified ff. 97-102 as a fragmentary quire, I propose a new collation for ff. 74-124: 5 26 (—5, —8, —26; ff. 74-96) 6 ? (ff. 97-102) 7 18 (—1, —10, —11; ff. 103-117) 8 6 + 1 (+7; ff. 118-124) or 8 14? (—8, —9, —10, —11, —12, —13, —14; ff. 118-124). And, since this interpretation reduces the number of quires from Horrall's thirteen to eleven, the conclusion of the manuscript can now be designated 9 22 + 1 (—20, —21, —22, +23; ff. 125-144) 10 24 (ff. 145-168) 11 18 (—14, —15, —16, —17, —18; ff. 169-181). Folios 74-124 then comprise four quires. Two of these reflect Thornton's normal tendencies. Two are unusually short; one is a fragment, whereas the other shows Thornton's tendency to copy texts in ongoing fascicular units. Lincoln Cathedral 91 has a fascicular format—six parts, each with reasonably homogeneous textual contents—and the London MS. seems similarly constructed: Part I = quires 1-2 two long excerpts from Cursor Mundi . Part IIa = quires 3-5 romances: The Siege of Jerusalem, The Siege of Milan, Roland and Otuel , with a few briefer items, especially at the end, ff. 94-96. Part IIb = quires 6-8 religious verse: The Quatrefoil of Love , Lydgate's "Virtues of the Mass," a versified Three Kings , with briefer items. Part III = quires 9-10 Richard the Lionhearted (romance) and a verse narrative of the infancy of Christ (IMEV 250). Part IV = quire 11 two dialogue poems: The Parliament of the Three Ages, Winner and Waster . 18 I assign the designations "IIa" and "IIb" to the problematic section of the manuscript on the chance that the lost folios may have included a fascicle boundary. I hope that this correction, in company with Stern and Horrall's pioneer work, will stimulate further the study of Thornton's miscellanies. As Horrall has already suggested, common paper stocks may imply contemporaneous copying and thus common sources, and someone may thus be able to identify some of Thornton's exemplars. This step, in turn, may make it possible to attain greater specificity about the construction of the manuscripts—which fascicles were in progress at what time (a relative chronology for the minimum of two decades over which Thornton's copying appears to have extended). And such studies may end with major advances in general literary history, for they will clarify the movement of texts in the north of England, c. 1430-1450.</field>

These notes grow out of a response to the important reevaluation of Additional 31042, Karen Stern, "The London 'Thornton' Miscellany," Scriptorium , 30 (1976), 26-37, 201-218. 2 The foliation of the manuscript includes four flies (ff. 1-2, 182-83), in fact pastedowns from an earlier binding. Except for catchwords on ff. 8 v , 32 v , and 73 v (which occur in nonproblematic positions), the manuscript lacks catchwords and signatures. 3 Manuscripta , 23 (1979), 103, n.13. 4 For the best summary of biographical information, see George R. Keiser, "Lincoln Cathedral Library MS. 91: Life and Milieu of the Scribe," Studies in Bibliography , 32 (1979), 158-180. For collation of the Lincoln manuscript, see D. S. Brewer and A. E. B.

I examine the ramifications of the problem more fully in a forthcoming article on Westminster School MS. 3. For an example analogous to Thornton's technique here one might compare British Library MS. Harley 2250. This codex, like Additional 31042, now exists as mounted single sheets and has not been collated, but one should note the tendency to begin new texts unconnected with preceding materials at the head of the next available page (not necessarily a recto, and thus surely not a quire boundary) and the concomitant presence of filler items; see ff. 49 v , 72 (column 2), 83 v , 84 v (column 2), and 87 rv (the end of the ms.). The last three instances likely occur within a single quire. See the description provided by Clifford Peterson, Saint Erkenwald (1977), pp. 3-6. 9 These losses have been recognized on three grounds—survival of stubs in the manuscript (as at ff. 110a and 110b), incompleteness of texts when compared with other copies (as at ff. 143a, 143b, and 143c, although there could be only two missing leaves and the quire a 22) and by inference in the case of unique texts (f. 77a in The Siege of Milan is posited on the basis of a break in the stanza form and some narrative discontinuity). For a definitive description of contents, see Stern, Scriptorium , 30 (1976), 214-18; for identification of lost leaves, see Stern, Scriptorium , 30 (1976), 28-30, with corrections by Horrall, Manuscripta , 23 (1979), 101-102. 10 Other efforts to place all these sheets into the same quire, or into two adjacent, but separate, quires are possible, but all will show similar inconsistencies. For example, splitting into two ten-leaf quires will give three full sheets with no watermark (ff. 103 + 110, 112 + 117, 114 + 115) and two sheets with two watermarks (ff. 105 + 108, 106 + 107), as opposed to only five normal full sheets. 11 And more complicated examples in quires 10 and 15, where three stocks of paper are involved. 12 Other examples include National Library of Wales, Peniarth 392 (the Hengwrt Canterbury Tales ), quire 22, where the supplemented quire reflects difficulties in the scribe's supply of copy (see A. I. Doyle and M. B. Parkes, The Canterbury Tales [1979], pp. xxxi-xxxii); two examples where scribes increase their writing space from without, by quiring an existing gathering within other bifolia, Huntington HM 144, quire 9 (see John M. Manly and Edith Rickert, The Text of the Canterbury Tales , 8 vols. [1940], I, 289-292) and Trinity College Cambridge R.14.45, part 6, quire 1 (see G. S. Ivy, in Francis Wormald and C. E. Wright eds., The English Library Before 1700 [1958], p. 42). Similar, but after the fact, are the several insertions of originally independent quires into existing ones in the Findern Miscellany, a text prepared by about thirty scribes; see Richard Beadle and A. E. B. Owen, The Findern Manuscript, Cambridge University Library MS. Ff.i.6 (1977), pp. viii-xi. 13 This view, of course, assumes that Thornton had a rational paper supply in which he obtained sheets of the same manufacture in largish lots, rather than constantly working with odds and ends. But certainly not all examples reflect later suppletion: quire 5 of Lincoln Cathedral 91 looks as if Thornton was at the end of his stock B and simply filled out the (eighteen-leaf) quire with stock L, which he had in profusion. (A total of 44 sheets in Lincoln 91 represent this stock.) If that was the case, quire 9, later in the same fascicle, and quire 3 of Additional 31042 were already partially copied before quire 5 was constructed. On Thornton's exemplars, no work has succeeded Angus McIntosh's ground-breaking "The Textual Transmission of the Alliterative Morte Arthure ," in Norman Davis and C. L. Wrenn eds., English and Medieval Studies Presented to J. R. R. Tolkien (1962), pp. 231-240. 14 A fair amount of evidence supports such conjectures. The leaves of the manuscripts show very uneven wear, but particularly heavy wear on folios one might hypothesize to have been the outsides of individual fascicles. (In fact, text-bearing first folios of quires have fared particularly badly in Thornton manuscripts: at least six, two with their conjugates, are missing in the sixteen quires of Lincoln 91.) The fascicles may have had several years of use as loose booklets before binding; they required some tailoring to be fitted together into codices. Thus the verso of Lincoln 91, f. 52, originally leaf 10 of quire 3, was given a catchword and the eight subsequent folios cancelled, probably at the time of binding. Partial correspondence of paper stocks (the two manuscripts share five stocks) seems to indicate that the texts were in progress simultaneously and their contents only divided later. 15 Although the enormous quire 16 of Lincoln 91 was created as a self-contained book of medical recipes, the thirty-leaf quire 15 could have originally been an 18, with extra leaves inserted in its center. 16 Halfsheets appear fairly regularly in paper manuscripts, and it is surprising that there are no clear examples in Thornton's work. As an example, Huntington HM 114, with paper sheets folded in quarto within a vellum sheet (which becomes the center and outer bifolia of each quire) has about 10% halfsheets. Given the unbound state of his fascicles, Thornton may have preferred replacing a full bifolium to using halfsheets. 17 My colleague, William O. Harris, has offered me helpful advice on the whole paper, but especially on this section: his arguments convince me that trying to view ff. 97-102 as substantially complete only creates difficulties, the postulation of such features as cancels or inserted singletons. 18 Most of the lost sheets at the end are probably cancels, since Winner appears nearly complete, with only a few lines lost at the end.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Models for the Textual Transmission of Translation: The Case of John Trevisa * by D. C. Greetham I</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A great number of works written in Middle English are in fact translations, in one sense or another, of originals written in French, Latin, Italian, and so on. This has long been recognised by mediaevalists in the voluminous investigation—and frequent publication—of "sources and analogues", where the critic might be able to observe the structural, narrative, linguistic, and aesthetic changes wrought by the translating author. On the textual side, there has been much editorial concern for establishing specific readings (and justifying them by appeal to these sources) in works by major authors. But there has been comparatively little study of the theory of such textual relations; the attention of critics, literary and textual, has been on the particular manifestation of translation in a given author, a given work, or a given reading, and the discussion of translation has therefore tended to be embedded either in editions of Middle English works or in critical examinations of mediaeval authors. For example, although Vinaver attempted to draw general theoretical maps for charting the possible range of scribal errors that could occur in the act of copying, 1 when it came to the editing of his Works of Sir Thomas Malory he was content to produce stemmata that reflected the specific textual conditions which obtained between the Winchester manuscript, the Caxton edition, and the French sources. 2 There was no theoretical study of the possible routes of transmission across the translation gap, but only of the actual (and therefore inevitably limited) translation process as used by his author—and this is perhaps only right when an editor is concerned to defend the individual emendations introduced into his text. Where arguments over translation have occurred, as for example in David C. Fowler's attack on George Kane and E. Talbot Donaldson's smoothing of the B-Text of Piers Plowman to conform with the A, they have usually concentrated on the validity of certain readings rather than on the theoretical attitude to translation. 3 In fact, there are theoretical positions underlying the work of Vinaver on Malory, Kane-Donaldson and Fowler on Langland. For Vinaver, it might be appropriate to suggest that his models for translation all rest upon the notion of fidelity, so that where alternatives in the Winchester and Caxton versions occur, the test is an appeal to the French, on the assumption that this will yield Malory's likely reading. 4 For Kane-Donaldson, the argument might be that internal harmony—metrical, alliterative, textual—should be the basis for editorial decisions, no matter what potential "interference" there may be from external authority (such as bibliography or translation), thereby assuming a prejudice on the editor's part that the author's work is motivated by a similar aesthetic. 5 For Fowler, in his response to Kane-Donaldson, the position would be that internal harmony is to be modified by textual standards available through such external authorities as translation. As Fowler says (p. 32), "One should not change a line just to make the author's words fit the text he is citing; but caution is surely advisable in emending if the MSS uniformly attest a reading which translates the Latin quoted." What is currently missing from, or undeveloped in, the theory of editing in Middle English is a model or models which can be employed in evaluating the conditions to be found in the translated and translating languages and texts. 6 It may also be that similar models could be useful in other periods and other fields, for as far as I am aware, the filiation paradigms constructed by such theorists as Maas, Pasquali, Quentin, Dearing, and Greg have been concerned only with establishing suitable methodologies within a given language, and have not normally devoted much attention to the problem of textual criticism between languages. 7 Thus, Dearing's "rings" are no more help than were Greg's "calculus" or Quentin's "positive critical apparatus" in charting the alternative structures and transmissions possible between, say, Latin and English. Stemmatic models have been generally responsive to textual features encountered in the transmission of texts in a single language, not of texts moving from one language to another—and this despite the fact that translation may frequently offer assistance in emendation which is not available to editors working on texts recoverable only from extant copies in one language. I propose to begin this process of creating models for stemmatic analysis of translation by citing textual examples from the work of one of the most prolific and influential of Middle English translators, John Trevisa, a translator who moreover left considerable discussion of the nature and mechanics of translation. 8 I therefore select Trevisa in part because his known (and avowed) position and practice on procedures for translation make him an ideal author for such a "control" necessary for the preliminary charting I suggest, and in part because his actual work appears to be governed by what we may call the "clere and playne" doctrine, involving a self-effacement of the translator which reduces the potential creativity (or idiosyncracy) of the derived text to a manageable or discoverable level, despite the lack of holographs for the author's work. My hope is that the models outlined in this discussion can perhaps be used in other periods and fields for the charting of similar problems. I posit three theoretical classes, generating four ideal models between the translated and the translating languages: —the first class, what we may call the Perfect Linear Class (MODEL A), with a consistent source and a consistent derived text. —the second class, with two types of the Imperfect Linear Class (MODELS B and C), the first with a translating language variance (i.e. a consistent source with an inconsistent derived text), and the second with a translated language variance (i.e. an inconsistent source with a consistent derived text). —the third class, or Parallel Variance Class (MODEL D), with an inconsistent source and an inconsistent derived text, clearly the most problematical model of the series. Finally, I consider the question of determined or auctorially conscious variation (as opposed to the postulated scribal variants charted in MODELS A-D), discussed under the two possible directions such determination can take: the gloss-type (or divergence from the norm of the source, usually in the form of an addition ), and the neologism-type (or divergence from the norm of the current medium, usually in the form of a substitution ).</field>

This is the Perfect Linear Class of consistent source and consistent derived text, with, however, some identifiable 'problem' in the translation, noticeable, we assume, by context but not by collation. 9 Stemmatically, this relation can be represented by the straightforward genealogy of the first model, where S is the source, the wavy line the act of translation, O” the archetype of the extant MSS in the translating language (in this case English), and the parenthetical ABCDE the agreement of those MSS. Note that the model would assume the same shape whether there were such a 'problem' in the translation or no, and the validity of McKerrow's rule of contextual identification 10 would have to be questioned before any editorial methodology for these examples could be invoked. Thus, arranging the readings given here to support MODEL A in a sequence dependent upon their likely contextual identification and upon no other consideration, possibly only erþe (in putative error for * eiþer ) and maybe nameliche and tokenes would be contextually startling enough for the editor to be alerted to a problem in translation. Extra-textual information, derived, for example, from geography and history, would be necessary to alert the editor abiding by the contextual rule in the cases of ybounde/yfounde, moche/marys, northe eeste/ southe eeste, lefte/lesse, weste/nexte, londes/ilondes , but no purely contextual analysis would isolate profytes or freliche or even hede , all of which are eminently sensible scribal rationalisations, and all of which fit their contexts perfectly. If translation is to be considered as a textual paradigm at all, then McKerrow's strict contextual rule, at least in reference to the translating language, must be dropped from our editorial discipline in MODEL A. Note further that all the suggested restorations (marked with an asterisk) should ideally be palaeographically closer to their corrupt derived forms than would be possible in a similar Latin corrupted tradition. I say this bearing in mind Housman's strictures on the limits of the palaeographic rationale, 11 and would argue that the principle is demonstrably clear in, for example, the relations of eende/hede, ybounde/yfounde, northe eeste/ southe eeste, lefte/lesse, weste/nexte, londes/ilondes, nameliche/meneliche, tokenes /torenes, erþe/eiþer , and freliche/vereliche (with the latter assuming a scribal muting of an initial voiced SW v to f ), and has high probability in all but the profytes/poetes pair, where an editor might have to decide whether palaeographic variation in the source could not also have produced a similar effect (i.e. Latin prophetarum/poetarum ). To put it as simply as possible: for MODEL A to be the correct paradigm for this type of textual problem, it must be easy for the scribal eye in the translating version to create the extant corrupt form from the putative original and virtually impossible for the scribe of the translated version to have made a similar error which could have been rendered into English by the translator. If a Latin MS reading prophetarum were to be discovered, then our suspicions about the fitness of MODEL A for this particular case would be confirmed. In the light of the universal poetarum all we can say with confidence is that MODEL A seems more plausible than any other, based on the evidence to hand. For verius, capite, palustris, euro, leuam, iuxta, mediocriter, torrentibus , and utraque an English scribal corruption of an originally correct translation would take care of all the evidence and would give us a useful translating paradigm. Examples using MODEL B (with contexts): Context and Variants a) Eng.: þe walle was of brode/brande tiellen (p. 724) Lat.: murus de coctili bitumine compactus b) Eng.: Of þat toune/toure þe cite þat þere is ybilt (p. 744) Lat.: turrim a qua ciuitas ibi edificata c) Eng.: for þere þe lynage/langage was confounded of hem þat belded þe tour Babel (p. 738) Lat.: ibi lingua edificantium turrim babel est confusa d) Eng.: and bereþ plente of corne and wyne/whete/wynde/of wordes (p. 758) Lat.: fecunda frugibus et vinifera e) Eng.: Also Inde is moste fulsome/holsome in westren wynde (p. 769) Lat.: Est autem india fauonio vento saluberrima f) Eng.: And þis londe was in olde ryme/tyme yclepede Tynatria (p. 811) Lat.: antiquitus trinacria dicebatur g) Eng.: And he is sharpe of wordes/woodes (p. 779) Lat.: Est autem siluis aspera h) Eng.: The londe is clippede/cleppede alle about with þe see (p. 748) Lat.: terra est mari vndique clausa A more complex corrective paradigm involves the problem of consistent source versus inconsistent translation, in the Imperfect Linear Class represented by MODEL B. Figure 2a is a straightforward example. In describing Babilonia, Trevisa's text in DPR reads, "þe walle was of brode/brand tiellen" to translate the Latin coctili ='burned'. This example reflects the same basic principle as the first model, that the divergence (or 'error') should be more plausible palaeographically in the translating than in the translated language. That is, an omitted nasal macron from a could very easily produce the rationalised scribal form brode , whereas a similar (non-extant) corruption of coctili to produce the same effect would be difficult to argue on palaeographic grounds. Emendation from a copytext brode to brand is therefore justified. The same principles hold for the alternative English forms listed in 2b-2h. This model (as its stemmatic arrangement demonstrates) can be considered to follow the same transmission form as MODEL A, except that in this case, both 'corrupt' and 'pure' readings are retained in the extant MSS, whereas in MODEL A, either 'pure' or 'corrupt' (but not both) readings appear, and the linear form is unmodified. This ideal MODEL B is obviously the easiest to use in editing translated texts, since there is a wider range of evidence available—including, we assume, the auctorial form—and conjecture, palaeographic or contextual, has a consequently reduced prerogative. Unfortunately, this ideal may not always be as common as the modern editor might desire, and it may conceal sophistications which may not be immediately apparent. For example, the English MSS variants (Figure 3) Assyria/Affrica —which, 3. Assyria (Assyria)/Affrica (p. 738) Frisia/ffrigia (p. 788) for gredynes of germaynes/gyauntes (Lat.: germani ) of course, with long s become even more similar: Assyria/Affrica —could be evaluated by reference to the consistent Latin Assyria . But since the proper names would not in fact be subject to 'translation', but rather to (identical) 'transliteration', there are no pure palaeographic grounds for assuming that the divergence in English authority does not reflect either a non-extant divergence in the Latin (i.e. contamination across the language boundary—see MODEL D2 below), or the preservation in Trevisa's source of the 'incorrect' Affrica which, through later scribal corruption, returns by chance or determined variation to its original Assyria (i.e., along a two-way street). Now, none of these latter conditions can be demonstrated through the extant evidence, but neither can they be totally disproven. They may be unlikely, and therefore emendation to Assyria justifiable, but they should at least be considered as qualifications to our ideal model. The Frisia/ffrigia example illustrates the same relation, as do many such occurrences in the Trevisa text of DPR . Another example should make this clearer. Trevisa's text reads, "for gredynes of germayns/gyauntes " as a translation of the consistent Latin germani (Figure 3). There is no doubt that historically, it was the Germans rather than the Giants who were responsible for the particular military aggression described, but of course, the textual critic is not necessarily concerned with historical truth but with textual accuracy. 12 The Latin germani certainly provides us with the authority for the germayns , but a putative gigantes is arguably very little further removed palaeographically from germani than is gyauntes from germayns , so that the same conditions as Assyria/Affrica could possibly apply, even though translation, not transliteration is now involved. An editor would probably be justified, under these circumstances, in using the act of translation as defence for an emendation of copytext gyauntes to germayns , but should search for any evidence of parallel corruption in the Latin source. These ambiguous cases, where the simple model still serves as the most plausible explanation of textual history, but where other possible routes have to be considered, gradually merge into a totally different model where a consistent Latin reading is of virtually no help in establishing the correct English form. We may still keep MODEL B before us as a paradigm, but its validity will begin to become questionable in the next few examples. 4. a) raþer/first/fyrst/furst etc. (Lat.: quondam ) b) ful/file/foul/full//fowle axen (Lat.: vilior . . . cinerem ) For instance, the variants (Figure 4a) raþer/first/fyrst/furst and so on are to a large degree 'accidental' divergencies which could depend upon scribal habit or whim. The problem is the form raþer , which OED , citing the meaning of "of earlier times", quotes as a Trevisa neologism (in this particular sense) and as obsolete, rare". There can be no doubt that the first form, with all its variants, is the most comfortable to the modern reader/ editor, but the doctrine of lectio difficilior probior est might be invoked here, since the dubiousness of raþer , preserved in only one manuscript and far outweighed by the other readings in a distributional analysis, would explain a scribal substitution, but not vice versa. Editorial retention of raþer (as a translation of Latin quondam ), supported but not confirmed by the Latin MSS, would be justified here, especially if (as so happens in this case), the raþer variant occurred in a manuscript bearing many other signs of 'authority.' The use of a Latin corrective gets even more difficult in Figure 4b, where we are confronted with the series ful/file/foul/full/fowle axen as a translation of Latin vilior . . . cinerem . The problem here is not what the Latin means, but whether these forms can all be regarded as 'accidental' scribal/ auctorial variants, with the same semantic core, or whether some should be seen as substantive variants (perhaps by accretion), so that gradual scribal corruption has, in effect, produced a 'different' word. For example, is ful to be considered as a form of full and therefore as an 'error', or is it a form of foul and therefore 'correct'? Does file possibly indicate an erroneous scribal correction or smoothing—voiced to unvoiced—of initial SW v in vile (much closer to the Latin form), or is it simply a decayed remnant of an original ful(e) with minim error? By a series of eminently clear palaeographic transmissions, we could postulate at least two separate routes to explain the extant English forms: vilior translated by the SW Trevisa as vile , corrupted scribally to file in an attempt to smooth out the SW dialect, then further corrupted into ful , foul etc. OR: vilior translated as foul , with a series of 'accidental' scribal variants to follow ( ful, file , etc.). 5a. Mesopotania hat/hyghte/is cleped/is calde/hap ethimologia of grew (p. 757) mesopotania grecam ethymologiam possidet 5b. x (Lat. form) [is called] y (Eng. form) [from] z (language/nation) + gloss 5c. A similarly ambivalent structure could be suggested for a slightly different problem, where Trevisa's text (Figure 5a) reads, "Mesopotania hat/ hyghte/is cleped/is calde/hap ethimologia of grew" as a translation of "mesopotania grecam ethymologiam possidet ". The forms is cleped and is calde are very common scribal variants of a translation of vocatus, nominata etc., but of course, in this case they misrepresent the Latin sense, as does the palaeographically unrelated hyghte . For the moment then, we can either assume that these forms are indicative of 'bad' MSS (and that the translation was originally correct), or that the forms are 'good' (and the translation is in error). Another, perhaps corrupting, influence may be mentioned here. In this section of DPR , the most pervasive rhetorical formula for the opening statement about each country described is the pattern shown in Figure 5b: the Latin name of a country (e.g. Gallia) is given its English version (France), explained as deriving from its inhabitants or their language, which is then given a suitable gloss. The formula is developed from the pressure of Isidore's transcendental etymological explicatio for the nature of all matter, but the textual significance here is that the formula could very well have forced the apparently similar rhetorical shape of this particular sentence into a pre-ordained mould which is, in fact, totally unsuitable for its semantic content. The problem is to decide whether scribe or author were responsible for the moulding. Here we can turn to the other two readings: hat/haþ . Were it not that t/th/þ variance can be so whimsical as to be virtually meaningless in establishing textual primacy (especially in 15C MSS), we could assume that haþ is correct (= possidet ) and that hat is either correct—if it is to be considered as a form of the verb have ) or incorrect—if it is a form of hatte=to be called . But hat 's ambiguity could be shared by haþ , so we are not necessarily any closer to the evaluation of either the translation or the extant forms. We can summarise our uncertainty in Figure 5c: where ethymologiam possidet is either translated correctly as hat (meaning has ) ethimologiea , but rationalised scribally—first by the normalising hap , then by the formulaic hyghte , which in turn is levelled to the individual scribal usage ( is cleped etc.). OR, the Latin is mis translated by the author as hyghte or hatte (both meaning is called and therefore generating scribal variants of this, one of which is hat , scribally altered to haþ ). Now, there is little doubt that an editor's acceptance of the translator's general competence would favour the first alternative and that a reading of hat (i.e. has ) would represent this belief most clearly. But the pressure of the rhetorical mould and the existence of a high degree of scribal ingenuity can qualify this position. One final possibility is that possidet was omitted in the Latin manuscript from which Trevisa made his translation and that the more expected hyghte forms are therefore a justifiable paraphrase of an apparently meaningless Latin sentence and therefore represent auctorial intention. In each of the cases in this section, despite the specific difficulties deliberately introduced into the discussion, we have been following basically the same paradigm—a consistent Latin authority to be used as a potential control for inconsistent English witnesses. The stemmatic MODEL B remains clear behind the clouds of possible corruption. Both MODELS A and B assume no prima facie evidence for corruption in S, an assumption which, strictly speaking, should depend upon a critical edition of S itself, and even of the sources of S. This latter sophistication is perhaps less of a difficulty in the generally tight plagiarism (or embedding of authority) found in the textual continuum of so many mediaeval works, particularly the encyclopaedias, but a brief illustration will demonstrate the inherent snare that the editor should be aware of. Eng.: The pleyne parties þerof þat beren corne ben byclyppede about . . . (p. 739) Lat.: pane/pone . . . circumdatur Trevisa's source, the De Proprietatibus Rerum of Bartholomaeus Anglicus, is itself very highly dependent on Isidore's Etymologiae . Isidore has been critically edited, but Bartholomaeus has not. 13 In describing Bactria, Trevisa's text reads (Figure 6, giving MODEL C), "The pleyne parties þerof þat beren corne ben byclyppede about . . ." which should not be subject to emendation by contextual evidence, for the sentence seems to make perfect sense and also appears to be an adequate if not completely accurate translation of Bartholomaeus' "pane . . . circumdatur". However, the critical edition of Isidore makes it clear that the 'correct' reading for this sentence should be pone=behind, in the back , not pane , and that Trevisa's translation is therefore in error, although the extant MSS of Bartholomaeus of English provenance all read pane and should therefore support the Trevisa reading. Since the palaeographic discrimination between the two Latin forms pone/pane is so slight, without the actual MS from which the translation was made, this numerical weight is not totally reliable, but should probably be accepted as confirming the 'accuracy' if not the 'correctness' of the translation. Emendation of "þat beren corne" to "behind" etc. is therefore unjustified. The ambiguity of the textual relationships in this second type of Imperfect Linear transmission (i.e. with the imperfection in the translated, not the translating, language) would give us either of the MODEL Cs, (figs. 6 or 7) dependent upon bibliographical evidence for variance at an earlier or later stage in the transmission of the original from which the translation was made. Examples of MODEL C: Latin English a) fontibus/montibus *founteyns/ mounteyns b) filia/filio douƷter (p. 727) c) aurea/antea toforehonde (p. 778) d) sinus/filius solem alone þe sone (p. 810) e) solis ardoribus/solis arboribus bare ooneliche of treen (p. 737) f) *fecunditatem/ securitatem plente (p. 771) g) *canibus/ captibus/raptibus/capitibus with houndes (p. 732) h) *infertilitatis/ fertilitatis bareyne (p. 810) i) *bouis/ bonis and catalle (p. 763) j) *anno/ auro in on Ʒere (p. 763) k) apri beers or beers boars (p. 742) This general pattern—a consistent English text but an inconsistent Latin —has no textual (or rather editorial) significance as long as one of the Latin variants can be seen as the source of the English uniformity. For example, in Figure 7, a fontibus/montibus variance in Latin and a uniform English mounteyns would not suggest emendation, but rather that the Latin source must surely have read montibus not fontibus . There is a possible palaeographic quibble to be argued here, for while there is no extant English reading founteyns , this putative form is no more orthographically distant from mounteyns than is fontibus from montibus (see the Assyria/Affrica, germayns/gyauntes example above). But without evidence for an English corruption parallel to the Latin—a condition to be discussed in MODEL D— the error must be confined to the Latin textual tradition. The readings of the Figure 7 type can, of course, be very useful in identifying MSS which could not have been used as a source by the translator (and may thus reinforce the bibliographical arguments based on provenance), but do not involve any immediate editorial prerogative. For example, the Latin variants filia/filio versus the English douƷter demonstrate that the English reading must derive from the filia group, since it is palaeographically much less easy to proceed from son to douƷter than from filio to filia . 7c-d illustrate the same situation. As a further extension of this general principle, we may postulate a (lost) Latin reading to explain the consistent English form. For example, the English plente may descend from a lost fecunditatem in error for the extant MSS reading securitatem , which would, with long s , be very similar to the lost form; and the English with houndes (Latin captibus, raptibus, capitibus ) presumably derives from a lost canibus . Similar conditions govern the infertilitatis/fertilitatis, bouis/bonis and auro/ anno variants. The last case listed in fig. 7 ( apri/beers etc.) offers a slightly different problem and interpretation. The English text omits any reference to the apri (i.e. boars ) and it might therefore be assumed that Trevisa's source similarly omitted the apri —i.e. a simple MODEL C. However, since the previous word in the English translation, beers , is palaeographically very similar to boars , the omission might have resulted from scribal homeoteleuton in the English copying (i.e. MODEL B). Otherwise translation is in these cases being used as a means of plotting the textual history of the translated language rather than the translating. The next degree of textual divergence—an inconsistent source and a parallel inconsistent translation—is perhaps the most difficult to draw a model for. If the inconsistencies seem independent, then we could simply combine MODELS B and C, but if they appear to be in parallel, then we might have to argue either for separate but equal translations (MODEL D1) —in general an unlikely event—or for a contamination model (D2) which crosses the language boundary—perhaps just as unlikely, since it assumes that a scribe was dissatisfied with his English exemplar and sought to correct it not from another English MS but from a Latin text different from that used by the original translator. 14 Neither of these models is necessarily satisfactory to explain the actual conditions of textual transmission through translation, however, and we might instead turn to a specific, and highly complex, example (Figures 10-11) to demonstrate the subtleties which the theoretical models could obscure. In a series of variants on the name of the river Moldau (or Vltava), the Latin MSS of DPR present a bewildering array of choices. These include: Waldani/multa/vltava/moldani/mulda/multe aque etc. Similarly, with all of the expected enthusiasm for proper name variation (a scribal characteristic which has led some theorists to banish proper names from the pantheon of critically emendable variants, on the ground that they are too interesting to scribes), the English MSS provide us with fulta/vulta/multa/many þinges/many ryuers . How are we to arrange this seeming confusion into any logical pattern which will tell us anything valuable about the Latin text, the English text, or the translation from one to the other? Ignoring the double-translation model as bibliographically implausible for this particular work (and, one suspects, for most others), 15 we could create what might look like a workable contamination model (fig. 10) which is essentially a specific working out of a D2 type. In this model, an original Moldau -like form (or its Slavic equivalent Vltava —a discrimination which might lead to an investigation of the linguistic sympathies of certain scribes) could have undergone a series of permutations within the Latin transmission, to produce e.g. multa from mulda (itself a form of Moldau ), and multe aque as a Latin scribal rationalisation of an apparently noun-less adjective. The translator would then have read multa in his source, but instead of rationalising as the Latin scribe had done, would regard the word as a neuter plural and render it simply as many þinges . In the context, however (a discussion of the rivers of Bohemia), this would seem at best weak, and at worst, nonsense. Two alert scribes would then seek to turn this supposed nonsense into something more appropriate for the context—one either by 'inventing' the apparently missing word ryuers (in a manner similar to that of the Latin scribe who wrote multe aque ) or perhaps by consulting the Latin MS of this scribe; the other by going to a different Latin MS bearing the corrupt (or original) Slavic Vltava , and rendering this as fulta/vulta in his own version. This explanation takes account of all the variants and plots them in a transmission system which is not impossible to demonstrate, but it is clumsy and puts far too much responsibility on the shoulders of too many scribes. Its deficiencies are that, because of a superficial parallelism of form ( Vltava and vulta versus mulda and multa ), it immediately assumes that contamination is the only way such parallels could have been created. We should note that it is not quite as ingenuous as that theory which would simply select the extant English variant which happens to be morphologically closest to either (or both) the modern English received form or that of the Latin originals. By this approach, one would merely look through an atlas until one came across the river in question, and then make a textual selection of, e.g. vulta as the 'obvious' English rendering of Vltava , assuming that it must therefore be auctorial—a promotion of 'correctness' over 'accuracy'. In place of these two schemes, let us attempt a model (fig. 11) which relies neither upon the atlas nor the editorial research of too many scribes. In this model, we assume that the Latin source for the original English translation read multa (just as in the previous model), but that instead of regarding this as a common noun and 'translating' it, Trevisa simply saw it as a possible variant for the proper noun=Moldau (which, of course, it is ) and transcribed it so. Alternatively, he could have felt uncomfortable with the context if he had regarded it as a common noun, and therefore left it in its Latin form rather than risk a translation, in effect creating a neologism by simple duplication of form. In either case, his fair copy would have read multa , and our arguments are guilty inevitably of the intentional fallacy if we pursue the discriminations further than this likelihood. Now the scribes enter the scene. Dissatisfied with multa as either a neologism or a proper noun—and we will see later why this might occur—one of them 'translates' the word as many þinges which, of course, makes nonsense of the text, and is therefore rationalised by the artful scribe of many ryuers . On the other hand, through a series of very simple minim confusions, the original multa becomes first * uulta , then vulta , and then, via normalisation or smoothing of an apparent SW initial voiced v, fulta . This model has the virtue of embodying the 'simplification' theory, and preserves the independence of the single act of translation, which should be one of our basic assumptions unless there is consistent or developed bibliographical, historical, and linguistic evidence for multiple translation or correction. Another example of a type D redrawn as B and C occurs in figure 12, where apparently parallel variants in the Latin and English ( numedia/in media , the latter with an English 'translation') can be explained by minim error (in Latin and English) and scribal rationalisation (in English only). The four models constructed so far hae all assumed a fundamental auctorial fidelity to the source; the problems have been in identifying and describing the likely transmission of this fidelity. We should now turn to a different sort of problem: conscious or determined auctorial variation. An immediate objection, of course, is that if the standard of fidelity is removed, then how are we to measure the degrees of scribal, as opposed to auctorial, interference with the text, which now lacks a consistent paradigm? There is no easy answer to this objection, except perhaps that a close study of translating habits as observable through the three 'simple' models might be sufficient to establish, at the very least, some degree of probability in each textual variance. In fact, with Trevisa the case may be a little more straight-forward than with other translators—and justifying yet again the use of his texts as a standard to measure divergencies. First, his views on the art of translation are known (though obviously we should always be careful of assuming that theory and practice are identical); second, if we divide these conscious departures into two basic types (the gloss-type, or divergence from the norm of the source, usually in the form of an addition; and the neologistic-type, or divergence from the norm of the current medium, usually in the form of a substitution), we shall see that Trevisa leaves a number of careful signposts to the identification of auctorial method. For example, to deal with the gloss-type first: where he finds peculiarities in his Latin original which seem to need explanatory material, Trevisa will usually mark his addition with his own name. Thus, in the chapter on Vitria, he inserts: "Treuisa: here lacketh for ne mencioun is ymade whider-warde þis ilonde shulde be. Some men wolde wene þat þis ilond is WyƷt, but WyƷt comuneliche is yclepede insula vecta and þis ile is here yclepede Vitria" ( DPR , xv. 172, p. 823). This marking is another manifestation of the translator's concern with fidelity: the reader must know what is genuinely found in the original and what is not. For the most part, this fidelity to source does not conflict with concern for the reader's understanding, although Trevisa had remarked that on occasion he must "set a resoun for a word" (see Appendix). At its simplest level, the gloss for the sake of the reading public may be no more than the tendency to form doublet expressions, which is strictly speaking not an 'addition' to the text—for it is often highly debatable which is the 'core' of the doublet and which the explanatory expansion. The genuine gloss itself can be observed at three levels of complexity, illustrated in Figure 13. The first, "bloo mennes londe" is a simple etymological translation 13. GLOSS-TYPE: Latin English Ethiopia Ethiopia , bloo mennes londe (p. 754) antipodes pe antipodes , men þat hauen here feet aƷenst oure feet (p. 754) castores castores , beasts þat leuen both in water and londe and gelden hemself whan þey been yhuntede (p. 785) solis vicinitas for þe sunne is nyƷe and rosteþ and tosteþ hem (p. 754) of the Latin (or properly Greek) and can be regarded as a 'perfect' gloss. The second, "þe antipodes . . ." etc. is still etymologically motivated, but offers a slight vernacular amplification, almost syntactic rather than semantic; and the third, "castores . . ." etc. becomes not only an etymological gloss and amplification, but a description of function too. In fact, the etymology—leading to castration—is obviously taken for granted. The first two would probably not alert an editor to a search for possible Latin source-equivalents for the gloss, but the third properly should. As it turns out, all three seem, on bibliographical evidence, to be genuine translator's glosses. All of this is straightforward enough. But the introductory section of Ethiopia continues, "for þe sonne is nyƷe and rosteþ and tosteþ hem", as a translation of solis vicinitas . In other words, there is no trace in the Latin for the semantic bud from which the humorous "rosteþ and tosteþ" might have bloomed as a gloss. Are we then to assume that the principle of auctorial fidelity must put this fascinating little doublet down to scribal fancy, for it is no longer bound by even loose rules of translation, nor marked as a 'Trevisa' insertion? Stylistically the "rosteþ and tosteþ" is typical Trevisa, though, as we have seen, used elsewhere as a technique for enlarging in English the semantic range of a Latin word, which now seems to be lacking in the source. Should we perhaps assume that the Latin is at fault and that a word meaning "to toast" or "to roast" or both has dropped out of the extant MSS? Certainly, any editor with a sense of humour would be loath to sacrifice the marvelously idiosyncratic comment, which is present in all English MSS; but not only is rhyme reinforcement very unusual in the standard Trevisa doublet, so is this humour we are so anxious to preserve. Such an indefinable personal quality is impossible to demonstrate on technical grounds, and it would be a glum job indeed to testify to the relative dourness of John Trevisa and Bartholomaeus Anglicus. Textual criticism must become aesthetic criticism at points like this, and the theoretical models will retreat. Moving on to a more complex model for the gloss, we shall see that there may, however, be occasions when technical assistance will help. In describing the Propontes, Trevisa's Latin source reads as in Figure 14a, with a very wide range of English variants, much simplified in the versions given here, for almost every MS has its own idiosyncratic way of interpreting the Latin, 14. NEOLOGISM-TYPE: 14a. Eng.: þe same water spredeþ and maketh {þere þe costes} of þe see {þat same coste} þat is yclepede Propontides {þat is to seye þe broode þerof conteneþ} {sone þerof conceyued/conteyned } {but lii bi lix /fifti} paces (p. 757) Lat.: eadem/autem aqua et facit propontidem qui mox in quinquaginta/l passibus coartatur 14b. Eng.: þe gumme þerof turneth into þeffecte of/in to effecte of/in to white/in to fecte/in/in to glas (p. 764) Lat.: cuius gummi infectum vitorum reddit pointing to a good deal of scribal confusion. Certain problems can be tested by one or other of our earlier models: for example, same with eadem/autem, sone with mox , and the passage contains far too many detailed problems of this type to be dealt with in full here. Our major concern is with the coartatur: conteneþ/conceyued/conteyned variants, and with the apparent gloss, "þat is to seye". This latter phrase most often occurs in Trevisa when explaining a difficult Latin etymology. Given that we accept our translator as competent, we should suppose that the phrase, if it is an introduction to such a gloss, would conclude with a correct explanation of the etymology. But Propontides does not mean "the breadth contains fifty paces" and so we must either propose that our translator nodded or that the phrase is a scribal rationalisation of what might have seemed an impossibly corrupt sentence. Pursuing this line of investigation, and moving into the second type of conscious variation—the neologism—we should now look at the coartatur problem and see what help that may give. The word has the basic sense of "confining" or "drawing together", but none of the English MSS does full justice to this sense. Again, we might suppose that our translator had erred, and that a form of 'contained' was his incorrect translation of the Latin. However, invoking the lectio difficilior principle, another solution appears more likely. The basic problem with any neologism is that it is new, and therefore will presumably not be immediately recognised by the scribe copying a text containing many such coinages. Since Trevisa, in his role as translator, was one of the greatest neologisers of his period, we might expect such scribal confusions to be frequent. Postulating for the moment, by an admittedly conjecturalist leap, a 'better' English translation ("constrained"), we should suppose that a scribe would seek to normalise the offending new word and reduce it to acceptable late Middle English (a form of "contain"). The evidence of OED in fact confirms that "constrain" is a Trevisa neologism and that such a scribal interference, thereby changing the whole meaning of the latter part of the sentence, is quite plausible. It might also be noted that a different passage in DPR also confirms this guess at "constrain", where this same word is indeed used to translate coartatur , but this time without scribal interference, possibly because the context would not admit a substitution and nonsense seemed preferable to wholesale slaughter. Returning again to the "þat is to seye" phrase, we can, after having resolved the "constrained" tangle, presume that "þat is to seye" is not a true auctorial gloss at all, but a scribal intervention necessitated by the displacement of Trevisa's neologism and the consequent bungling of the sentence. An intelligent but harmful scribe (apparently the most dangerous sort) thought he might save the passage by conceiving of the latter part as a gloss—but in error. More typically, the neologism is in Trevisa's case almost the opposite of a gloss: that is, the retention of the original form of the Latin or the substitution of a slightly anglicised equivalent (see the multa example above). The coartatur/constrain problem is a genuine translation, but many of Trevisa's neologisms are virtually transliterations. The technique is to drop the Latin word whole into the syntax of the English sentence and then make it behave as if it were English, rather than to form semantic equivalents through the juxtaposition of pre-extant English morphemes (as in the Old English translation of trinitas as þriness ). The problem for the editor, and the modern reader, is that sometimes this technique works, and the word catches on, but that sometimes the neologism becomes a virtual nonce-word, and therefore unrecognisable outside the context of translation and extremely liable to scribal interference. For example, the Latin cuius gummi infectum vitorum reddit of Figure 14b is rendered as "þe gumme þerof turneth into þeffecte of/in to effecte of/ in to white/in to fecte/in /or in to glas" in the various MSS. The scribes were obviously at their wits' end again. What could the author mean, and how are we, the modern readers, to discover what he actually said before this overlay of scribal ingenuity took place? Again, assuming the translator to be competent, we can postulate that he knew that infectum meant 'imperfect'. But none of the English forms comes very close to such a word. Therefore, the next step is to suppose that the word he used was unknown to the scribes, who therewith buried it by rationalisation. In fact, traces of the direction of this rationalisation can still be seen in the forms þeffecte, fecte, effect , all of which could be the decayed remains of an original anglicised neologism infect , to mean 'imperfect' and to translate infectum . Note that contextually there would be no grounds for arguing that the first of the variants listed "turneth into þeffecte of glas" was in error, so complete is the scribal reworking. Furthermore, it is only the apparent nonsense of fecte and white (the latter of which showing a scribe having thrown up his hands in dismay at his author's obtuseness), which would alert us to the traces of an earlier, neologistic form. But none of this need have occurred if the neologism had been immediately accepted. Since all the English MSS were copied some time after the author's death, a successful neologism would theoretically have become established by the time the scribes were at work, and they (and we) would have had no problems with infect meaning 'imperfect', provided, that is, the troublesome word had not been removed even earlier in the stemma. Again, OED and MED confirm that infect is a Trevisa neologism, and one which failed to enter the language permanently. The last textual problem to be considered—that of such confirmation of an editorial emendation based on translation—has already been hinted at, but some general cautions are probably useful here. As mentioned earlier, the postulated emendation constrained as a translation of coartatur was confirmed not only by a similar passage elsewhere in DPR , but also by the evidence of OED . But ideally, we should have worked out, on critical and textual grounds, a likely auctorial version before the discovery of supporting material, otherwise there will obviously be the tendency to make the desired reading fit the context. In this sense, such apparent aids as concordances and lexicons might actually be hindrances to solid editorial emendation, as might the evidence of historical dictionaries, especially by the confirmatory 'short circuit' where the only citation for the problematical word or usage is in the very context which the editor is attempting to restore. When trying to recapture the textual processes whereby a particular reading became 'corrupt', it is clearly better to have worked through the chronology of transmission and to have satisfactorily explained each stage, than to have leapt to the conjecture whose sole virtue is its reinforcing the aesthetic predispositions of the editor. Such was the danger in the Vltava/Moldau case cited earlier, where a facile acceptance of an apparently appropriate word would have had to ignore, or sacrifice, any consideration of the textual routes to the establishment of a reading.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Since all the citations used to support or illustrate the four basic models and their extensions are drawn from the work of a single author (in fact from a limited section of only one translation), I obviously cannot expect that MODELS A-D will prove capable of accommodating all textual conditions where translation is involved in establishing or charting the transmission of a text. Indeed, as has been shown, there are in Trevisa no genuine examples of either MODEL D1 or D2, both of which can probably be broken down into a combination of MODELS B and C. However, the fact that there is a theoretical need for a fourth class, and that this class would result in models looking something like D1 or D2, does confirm that the focus of this discussion is more on the construction of usable models than on representing the work of one author through stemmatic diagrams (as happens in the Vinaver/Malory example mentioned earlier). The area most likely to need elaboration is doubtless the gloss/neologism alternative, especially in the degree of variance from the norms of context and source. It is here that Trevisa's characteristics as translator are most influential over the paradigms suggested in this article, for his neologising tendencies (a result of his sense of the English language as needing semantic enlargement) and his "clere and playne" doctrine combine to establish fairly trustworthy limits on the translator's prerogative. But one can certainly imagine circumstances where this prerogative can be so enlarged as to reduce the validity of the gloss/neologism alternative as a means of describing the liberties undertaken. When, for example, Chaucer is charged, in the Prologue of The Legend of Good Women , that "thou hast translatid the romauns of the rose" (l. 329 [F version], 255 [G version]), are we to suppose that the same act is invoked as when Johnson insists that "Poetry cannot be translated, and therefore it is the poets that preserve languages" (Boswell, Life of Johnson , 11 April 1776)? Whatever Johnson meant by that remark, should we assume that Chaucer had proved him wrong by tackling a poem like the Romaunt ? Johnson's suggestion would deny exact equivalence (of the sort we have been observing in Trevisa) in any other medium—even syntactic—a notion disputed by Locke's claim that this function of equivalency as opposed to definition is the only proper responsibility of translation: "This is to translate, and not to define, when we change two words of the same signification one for another" ( Essay on Human Understanding , 3. 4. 9). The problem, of course, is in the slippery term "signification", which (as we have seen) to Trevisa frequently meant enlargement or expansion. But could it then be argued that LaƷamon's Brut , with its more than doubling of the 15,000 lines of Wace, is in any appropriate sense a translation of his French "source", or is the Roman de Brut itself a translation of the Latin of Geoffrey of Monmouth? The game, played with some wit by Valerie Flint in her suggestion that Geoffrey's Historia is a parody, 16 could continue back to Geoffrey himself with his fanciful claim that he was only "translating" the little Welsh book given to him by Walter of Oxford. Translation, through its emphasis on continuity and tradition rather than individual creativity or idiosyncracy, becomes a mediaeval staple for the reticent poet, and is exploited with considerable skill by the humble Chaucerian narrator of, for example, Troilus and Criseyde , where, despite the claimed subservient role of the English poet, the use of MODELS A-D would hardly occur in editorial practice. 17 As a device for defending one's work against the supreme charge of "fiction", translation may therefore become one of the rhetorical artifices of fiction itself, and the ironic stature and methods of the translator could deliberately obscure any models to be found in charting this new construct. For most authors in Middle English, however, one can probably proceed downwards from a conventional source study, establishing the putative degree of fidelity, to a genuinely textual consideration of the value of these models in describing and resuscitating the translated text. The more prominent the models, the less original is the translator and the more purely textual the criticism of the translation. As the models recede (as arguably they do in Piers Plowman but not in Malory), then the larger the editorial prerogative to reconstruct without deference to a source reading.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX: TREVISA THE TRANSLATOR The purpose of this brief appendix is to describe, for readers who may be unfamiliar with Trevisa's work, his general principles for translation as discussed in his theoretical writing on the subject. The texts covered here will be well-known to most mediaevalists, who should not therefore expect a re-evaluation of Trevisa's translation techniques. 18 For non-mediaevalists, however, the materials may provide an illuminating background to the specific cases cited in this study. In the Dialogue on Translation 19 the problem is stated in characteristically plain terms: that people of different nations "vnderstondeth others speche no more than gaglinge of gees. For jangle that one neuer so fast, that other is neuer the wyser though he shrewe hym instede of good morrow. This is a grete meschyef that foloweth now mankynde." The remedy for this cultural and social problem is "that some man lerneth and knoweth many dyuerse speches. And so bytwene strange men of the whiche neyther vnderstondeth others speche suche a man may be mene and telle eyther what other wole mene." The translator is thus a "mene" between oppositions created by the difference of language, and it is important not to undervalue this directly communicative (as opposed to individually creative) theory of translation, since it not only determines the linguistic motivation for translation but also characterizes stylistic and rhetorical effects—often to the dissatisfaction of the modern critics. Witness, for example, A. J. Perry's unease: "He wished to be understood—this resulted in wordiness," 20 although the comment seems eventually to be only a reflection of the conventional (and convenient) Trevisa use of the doublet as a reinforcement of the semantic "core" of the Latin original; the problem is not so much Trevisa's wordiness (in any rhetorical sense) but the density of the Latin vocabulary and the translator's need to provoke late Middle English into extending its lexicon (by the means suggested in the discussion above). In the shadow-boxing of the Dialogue , it is the Lord who is given all of those arguments which Trevisa is to exemplify in the translations themselves: that a "skylfull" translation is one that "myght be knowe and vnderstonden," rather than one demonstrating the creative power of the translator; that "prose is moore clere than ryme, more easy and more playne to knowe and vnderstonde" and should therefore be employed wherever possible. In fact, all of Trevisa's major translations are of Latin prose works, and when verse is occasionally embedded therein, he will usually render it as prose, sometimes with a suspiciously anti-poetic comment like "God woot what þis is to mene". The doggerel verses at the head of DPR (if they are by Trevisa), merely reinforce the implication that verse was a foreign and uncomfortable medium to the translator. 21 There is no need to be concerned here with the cultural or literary or even theological defence of translation in the Dialogue , except to note that, in citing Jerome, Alfred, Caedmon, and Bede (and the act of "prechyng" as "very translacioun"), Trevisa is determined to establish and affirm the continuity not of literary merit (for, as he remarks, the Hebrew which Jerome translated was already "good and fayr and ywrytte by inspyracioun of the holy gost"—i.e. Jerome did not improve the original by turning it into another language), but rather the continuity of the subservience of the translator to the work and its author, and the duty and necessity of following the "clere and playne" doctrine. How did Trevisa imagine that this theory would turn out in practice? A partial answer to this question (beyond the translated texts themselves) is contained in the Epistle to Lord Berkeley : "For travell wol I not spare comfort . . . to make this translation clere and playne, to be knowe and understondyn. In some place I shall set word for word and actiffe for actiffe and passife for passife arowe right as it standeth without changinge the ordre of words. But in some places I must change the order of words and set actiffe for passife and aƷenward. In some places I must set a resoun for a word, and tell what it meaneth; but for all such changing the meaning shall stand and not be chaunged." This practical description of technique presents us again with an espousal of fidelity, but a fidelity which may modify its form if not its nature or intention. Thus, the concept of subservience may be rather ambiguous: is the translator being more faithful by setting "passife for passife arowe right as it standeth," and perhaps thereby producing an unintelligible sentence in English, or by giving "a resoun for a word" (e.g. in glosses or neologisms), and destroying therefore a verbatim parallel in the hope of achieving a greater clarity, and thus semantic rather than morphological or syntactic "fidelity" to the source? As is obvious here, Trevisa is at least conscious of the problem and its alternative resolutions, and as I hope is evident from the body of this article, he could arrive at his goal of fidelity through one of several practices.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * A version of this paper was given at the Medieval Colloquium of the University of Washington, Seattle, in 1979. 1 Eugene Vinaver, "Principles of Textual Emendation" in Studies in French Language and Mediaeval Literature Presented . . . to M. K. Pope (1939), pp. 351-369. 2 Eugene Vinaver (ed.), The Works of Sir Thomas Malory (2nd. ed. 1967), 3v., esp. v. 1, chapter IV, "The Method of Editing", pp. c-cxxvi. The point is that the principles described in Vinaver's "Textual Emendation" article—while they draw their examples from Malory—could be applied to virtually any scribal copying, whereas the discussion in the Malory volume has few implications for the editing of other texts. 3 David C. Fowler, "A New Edition of the B Text of Piers Plowman", The Yearbook of English Studies 7 (1977), 23-42, a review of Piers Plowman: The B Version. . . . An Edition in the Form of Trinity College MS B. 15. 17 . . . . ed. George Kane and E. Talbot Donaldson (1975). See esp. Fowler, p. 32, for a defence of "He is worse þan Iudas þat Ʒiueth a iaper siluer" (based on Latin proditor est prelatus cum Iuda ) over Kane-Donaldson's harmonising of the alliterative stave "He is Iugged wiþ Iudas þat Ʒyueþ a Iaper siluer". The translation issue is, of course, only one small part of Fowler's case against the Kane-Donaldson editorial method. 4 Vinaver, Malory, esp. pp. cxiv-cxviii. See, for example, the defence of "holes" (Caxton) over "towyrs" (Winchester) by reference to French "fenestres"; "hors" (Caxton) over "swerde" (Winchester) by reference to French "cheval"; "bed" (Winchester) over "hede" (Caxton) by reference to French "lit", all supported by the stemma: 5 Kane-Donaldson, Chapter III, "The Archetypal B Manuscript", pp. 70-97. "The strong presumption of the corruptness of the archetypal text of the B version of Piers Plowman is a main instrument for its editors" (p. 97), a position which allows the editors to restore the "compression, pregnancy, technical excellence, and in the end . . . the poetry" which they find lacking in the scribal versions. 6 This is not to say that useful textual work has not been done on mediaeval translation. For example, Anthony J. Cárdenas has, in a series of recent conference papers, specialised in a bibliographical/codicological investigation of translation, producing much convincing evidence: "Variant Codices and the Reconstruction of Lost Text in the Libro del Saber de Astrologia of Alfonso X, el Sabio", Annual Meeting of the Medieval Institute of the University of Western Michigan, Kalamazoo, 1982; "The Florentine Version of Alfonso X's Libro del Saber de Astrologia : The Case of the Tell-Tale Lacunae". Society for Textual Scholarship Conference, New York, 1983. Similarly, David Yerkes has done much useful work on the textual implications of Old English translation from Latin— see especially his An Old English Thesaurus (1979). Most of the standard editions of major Middle English authors (Chaucer, Gower, Langland, Lydgate etc.) do, of course, contain textual notes where appropriate, citing readings in sources translated by the Middle English text, but as in the case of Vinaver's Malory mentioned above, these rarely have theoretical value and are normally limited to demonstrating the textual transmission of specific readings. See note (17) below on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde as an example. Kenneth E. Carpenter's "The Bibliographical Description of Translation", Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 76 (1982), 253-271 focuses on the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries and has no clearly textual implications (unlike the bibliographical work of Cárdenas). 7 See Paul Maas, Textual Criticism , translated by Barbara Flower (1958), Giorgio Pasquali, Storia della tradizione e critica del testo (2nd. ed. 1952). Henri Quentin, Essais de critique textuelle (1926), Vinton A. Dearing, Principles and Practice of Textual Analysis (1974), W. W. Greg, The Calculus of Variants (1927). All of these studies provide theoretical models (especially stemmatic models) for representing the transmission of a text, but while it might be possible to modify, say, Maas' Lachmannian system to respond to the special problems created by translation, such a modification does not seem to have interested these theorists. 8 See Appendix for a discussion of Trevisa as translator. + All page numbers refer to the critical edition of Trevisa's De Proprietatibus Rerum (1975), for which I edited Book XV. The text is based on BL MS. Add. 27944. Latin readings cited here are from Bodley 749 and the Vatican copy of Georg Hausner's 1485 Strassburg edition. Because there is no critical edition of the Latin text—nor even if there were, could we be sure that it reflected the manuscript Trevisa used for his translation—there is no attempt to 'correct' the Latin readings except where noted. 9 i.e. collation of all extant manuscripts in the translating and translated languages reveals no variant within each separate language , but the context does perhaps suggest some problem in the textual tradition. In the examples cited in support of MODEL A, there is unanimity in the readings of extant manuscripts of both languages (although not with each other), but since we are postulating a non-extant reading in the textual tradition of the translating language, the evidence derived from context would be available only within that language. As the discussion demonstrates, the degree of doubt created by the context will probably vary greatly. 10 R. B. McKerrow, Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare . A Study in Editorial Method (1939). McKerrow's rule is that the editor should depart from "the originals . . . only where they appear to be certainly corrupt" (p. 20). This corruption is defined as "any form which, in the light of our knowledge of the language at the time when the text in question was written, was 'impossible', that is, would not have been, in its context , an intelligible word or phrase" (p. 21, italics mine). My point is that none of the forms listed as illustrations of MODEL A could fall clearly under McKerrow's rule (which is questioned by W. W. Greg, The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare , 2nd ed. [1951], p. xxvii) and that even collation—which McKerrow does allow in a later part of the Prolegomena —would fail to identify the dubious reading. Translation, in the case of MODEL A, becomes virtually the sole ground for the "judgment" which McKerrow falls back upon: "Ultimately, however, the decision whether a reading is sound, and therefore to be allowed to stand, or an error of transmission, and therefore, if possible, to be set right, is a matter of the editor's personal judgment" (p. 35). 11 A. E. Housman, "Preface to Manilius I 1903" in Selected Prose , ed. J. Carter (1961), p. 50. "a conjecture which alters only a single letter may be more improbable palaeographically than one which leaves no letter unaltered". Housman argues that "closeness to a MS" is not one of the "merits essential to a correction". While I would agree with Housman's general principle that the emendation must not depend solely upon palaeographic similarities, it must surely be only logical that, given two parallel textual traditions, an emendation must satisfy palaeographic probability more securely in one tradition than the other if it is to be shown that the error in copying occurred in only one language. 12 See G. Thomas Tanselle, "External Fact as an Editorial Problem", Studies in Bibliography 32 (1979), 1-47 for a discussion of this problem. 13 Isidorii Etymologiarvm , ed. W. M. Lindsay (2v. 1911). Bartholomaeus' De Proprietatibus Rerum is to be edited by J. D. Pheifer of Trinity College, Dublin. Books III and IV of the Latin DPR were edited by James M. Long (1979). 14 Subsequent editors/publishers of Bartholomaeus/Trevisa claimed to have done just that, but the evidence is ambiguous at best. See Berthelet (1535), Bertholomevs de Proprietatibvs Rervm . "This booke . . . is newely printed with many places therein amended by the latyne examplare" and Thomas East (1582) Batman vppon Bartholome , where the changes introduced by Batman are mostly additions (marked as such) prompted by recent scientific and geographical discoveries. See V. M. Parrish, "Batman's Additions from Elyot and Boorde to His English Edition of Bartholomaeus Anglicus" in Studies in Language, Literature and Culture of the Middle Ages and Later , ed. E. B. Atwood and A. A. Hill (1969), pp. 337-346 and D. C. Greetham, " On the Properties of Things : From Patristic Repository to 'Shakespeare's Encyclopaedia'", CUNY English Forum II (1980) forthcoming. 15 This is not meant to suggest that a work may not be translated twice (Trevisa himself translated works which were then retranslated during the Fifteenth Century— De Regimine Principum , Bodleian Library MS Digby 233, ff. 1-182 v , transcript by David C. Fowler, concordance by Kenneth C. Conroy, no edition; retranslated by Thomas Hoccleve, ed. Thomas Wright (Roxburgh Club, 1860), F. J. Furnivall (EETS E.S. lxxii, 1897), and Polychronicon , printed by Caxton (1482), De Worde (1495), Treveris (1527), C. Babington and J. R. Lumby ( Rerum Britannicarum Medii Aevi Scriptores vol. 41, Polychronicon Ranulphi Higden Monachi Cestrensis , 1865-86), 9v. Rolls Series, which also contains the anonymous Fifteenth-Century translation), but rather that the two translations are unlikely to share the same bibliographical/textual traditions (i.e. to be regarded as a single composite work, exemplified in the same manuscripts). A. S. G. Edwards, in his chapter "John Trevisa" ( Middle English Prose: A Critical Guide to Major Authors and Genres , forthcoming) suggests the possibility of a two-stage translation for the DPR , but this two-fold translation would not necessarily represent MODELS D1 or D2, unless that is, it could be shown that the translator (or subsequent scribes) had translated from two different manuscripts belonging to two different parts of the Latin textual tradition. 16 Valerie I. J. Flint, " The Historia Regum Britanniae of Geoffrey of Monmouth: Parody and Its Purpose. A Suggestion" Speculum 54 (1979), 447-468. 17 The text of Chaucer's major source, the Filostrato of Boccaccio, has been printed as an aid to critical commentary on Chaucer's "translation" (e.g. Chaucer Society, ed. W. M. Rosetti, 1873-83, parallel texts), but this and other sources are usually cited in critical editions more in general explanatory notes and only rarely in textual apparatus (see e.g. IV. 57-59 in F. N. Robinson, The Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer (2nd. ed. 1957), p. 910). 18 Representative opinions include M. C. Seymour, "A Note on the Text" in On the Properties of Things. John Trevisa's Translation of Bartholomaeus Anglicus' De Proprietatibus Rerum (2v. 1975), "Trevisa was an intelligent and competent Latinist who generally (and sometimes literally rather than idiomatically) followed the Latin text before him without question" (p. xv); Babington and Lumby, "Trevisa appears to have been puzzled with the Latinity of Higden . . . It must be owned that Trevisa has occasionally fallen into the most ludicrous errors, which a very little 'avisement' might have avoided . . . It is impossible not to perceive that Higden's scholarship is very far superior to that of his translator" (p. lxi); A. C. Cawley, however, finds at most an "occasional" mistranslation ("Relationships of the Trevisa Manuscripts and Caxton's Polychronicon", London Mediaeval Studies i, 1937-48, pp. 464-65); and Kinkade's study of the same work turns up only three errors in translation (B. L. Kinkade, The English Translations of Higden's Polychronicon , Urbana, Illinois, 1934, p. 8). A number of mistranslations are found in H. K. Kim's edition of Trevisa's Gospel of Nichodemus (Ph.D. Diss. University of Washington 1963). See also D. C. Greetham, The Fabulous Geography of John Trevisa's Translation of Bartholomaeus Anglicus' De Proprietatibus Rerum (Ph.D. Diss. CUNY 1976, pp. 175-183) and T.

      <field name="heading_text">Misconceptions About the Geneva Bible by Naseeb Shaheen</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The publication of the Geneva Bible in 1560 was a major event in the history of English Bibles. Produced by some of the best scholars of the day, it strongly influenced the King James version which appeared half a century later. Its influence on Shakespeare and his contemporaries is well known; whenever Shakespeare's biblical references can be traced to any one version, it is most often to the Geneva. Even the Catholic Douay-Rheims Bible adopted numerous Geneva readings. The virtues of the Geneva, however, have given rise to several widely-held misconceptions: (1) As soon as it appeared in 1560, it became the most popular English Bible; (2) although a few editions were published in black letter, most editions appeared in roman; (3) it was the Bible of the Puritans. The notion that the Geneva Bible "immediately won" widespread popularity and from the outset became the best seller is widespread. The Historical Catalogue of Printed Editions of the English Bible 1525-1961 says that the first edition, "appearing as it did in compact form, with roman type and verse divisions, obtained speedy and permanent popularity." 1 Other authorities say that once published, "the Geneva Bible leapt at once into deserved popularity," that it "immediately sprang into popularity." 2 In his Introduction to the facsimile of the 1560 Geneva Bible, Lloyd E. Berry says that by 1565, "the Geneva Bible had firmly established itself as the most popular Bible in England." 3 Although it is true that the Geneva aroused a great deal of interest when it first appeared, it actually got off to a slow start. The Geneva Bible did not become the most widely-circulated version till after 1576, when for the first time it was allowed to be published in England. In 1560, Queen Elizabeth gave John Bodley (father of the founder of the Bodleian Library) an exclusive patent to publish the Geneva Bible for seven years, but the patent stipulated that the Geneva Bibles he published be in an edition approved by the Bishops of Canterbury and London. 4 Archbishop Parker discouraged publication of the Geneva, since the return of the Marian exiles eager for a more thorough reform of the English Church was a matter of concern to him, and he wanted an edition without the "bitter notes" of the Geneva. In 1564, well before the license expired, both Parker and Grindal recommended the renewal of Bodley's license for another twelve years. But no Geneva Bible came off the press in England till Parker died in 1575 and a Geneva New Testament was printed by Thomas Vautroullier and published by Christopher Barker ( STC 2877; DMH 141). The first complete Geneva Bible to be published in England did not appear till the following year, 1576 ( STC 2117; DMH 143). Between 1560 (when the Geneva first appeared) and 1575, 18 editions of the complete English Bible were published. Eight of these were Great Bibles, 5 seven were Bishops', 6 but only three were Genevas, these three being published in Geneva in 1560, 1562, and 1570. 7 During the same period, six editions of the Bishops' New Testament appeared, 8 six Tyndale New Testaments, 9 but only two of the Geneva, one of these being the Geneva New Testament published for the first time in London in 1575. 10 Only after the printing of the Geneva commenced in England, did it outsell all other versions. Of the 27 editions of the complete Bible published in the decade from 1576 to 1585, 20 were Geneva Bibles while only 7 were Bishops' Bibles. No other versions of the complete English Bible were published during that time. The Geneva Bible was the most popular Bible throughout Shakespeare's lifetime. From 1576, when the Geneva first began to be printed in England, till 1611, when Shakespeare's dramatic career was almost over and the King James Bible appeared, a total of 92 editions of the complete Bible were published in England. Eighty-one of these were Geneva Bibles and 11 were Bishops' Bibles. But the Geneva Bible had to wait sixteen years before it became the most popular English Bible. 11 A second misconception about the Geneva is that most editions were published in roman type rather than black letter. The comprehensive survey of English Bibles by Hugh Pope states that the majority of editions were in roman type, although "black letter type persisted in some editions; e.g. in those of 1589, 1592, and 1608, though the marginal notes remained in Roman type." In explaining the Geneva's popularity, Pope says: "Its clear type compared favorably with the old black letter." 12 Numerous other authorities stress the fact that the Geneva was published in roman letter, and imply that most if not all editions of the Geneva Bible had roman type. 13 Although it is true that the first seven editions of the complete Geneva Bible appeared in roman letter, there was a great demand for black letter editions and, of the many editions published in England, more appeared in black letter than in roman. The first black letter edition appeared in 1578 when a huge folio edition was printed ( STC 2123; DMH 154), and black letter editions appeared regularly thereafter. During the first twenty years that the Geneva Bible was published in England from 1576-95, 24 editions appeared in black letter against 19 in roman. 14 Between 1560, when the Geneva first appeared, and 1616, when the last complete Geneva Bible was published in England, a total of 90 editions of the complete Geneva Bible appeared. Forty-six of these were in black letter and 44 in roman. 15 Clearly, roman type was not the prime reason for the popularity of the Geneva, for black letter editions seem to have been in greater demand in England. Only if we include the editions published outside of England in our count would the roman letter editions slightly outnumber the black. Finally, although the Puritans preferred the Geneva Bible over the authorized translations of the day, so did many Anglicans. Not a few of these were bishops and archbishops. Even after the Authorized Version of 1611 was published, many bishops continued to use the Geneva Bible. Lancelot Andrews, though not only a bishop but also one of the translators of the 1611 Authorized Version, almost always preached from the Geneva Bible and rarely from either the Bishops' or the version he helped translate. Of over 50 sermons preached by Bishop Hall between 1611 and 1630, Hall used the Geneva Bible in 27 of the sermons and the Bishops' in only five. Bishops Laud and Carleton as well as Dean Williams all used the Geneva Bible as late as 1624. In the sixteenth century, Babington, Bishop of Worcester; George Abbot, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury; John King, afterwards Bishop of London; Richard Hooker and Archbishop Whitgift, all used the Geneva Bible. 16 Even the numerous Scripture quotations in the lengthy translators' letter to the reader which prefaced the Authorized Version of 1611 were made from the Geneva rather than from the Bishops' Bible. Thus, use of the Geneva is by no means an indication of one's religious convictions.</field>

These variants constitute the most significant of those recorded in surviving copies of the 1611 quarto. Although the copy now in the Robert H. Taylor Collection located at The Firestone Library, Princeton University, is included among those collated for F. Bowers's edition in The Dramatic Works of Thomas Dekker (Cambridge, 1958, rev. 1966), vol. iii, the variants unique to this copy are not noted. Moreover, close examination of copies of the 1611 quarto has revealed numerous instances of speech prefixes transferred whole and in part from one forme to another. This feature sheds new light on aspects of the printing of this play and may also have implications for other one-skeleton play texts printed by Nicholas Okes and possibly by fellow printers as well. In addition, a previously unrecorded copy has come to light: that in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University. 2 This copy contains no new variants, and press corrections conform to those evidenced in the other known copies. A note listing the disposition of its variants in relation to those in other copies is given below. The unique variants in the Taylor copy are in the form of altered speech prefixes and direction line on sig. D4r. The changes to the speech headings are interestingly restricted to character identification only; the Mist. / Maist. sequence, including the arrangement of swash and regular italic capital Ms and ligatured sts remains exactly as in its original setting. Apart from these, the Taylor copy agrees with variants already noticed in other copies. For convenience, the following (with the addition of CtY=Yale) is designed to conform to the arrangement set out in Bowers's edition of The Dramatic Works of Thomas Dekker : SHEET D ( inner forme ) 1st stage corrected : BM 1, NLS, MB. Uncorrected : BM 2, Bodl, CCC, Dyce, CSmH, CtY, DFo, Pforz. sig. D4r II.i.367 Hogſ-/den] Hogſ-/dcn 2nd stage corrected : Taylor. II.i.364 Open. ] Gal. 365 Gal. ] Tilt. 366 Tilt. ] Gal. 370 Tilt. ] Gal. 371 Tilt. ] Gal. catch word M.Gal. Come] Come Possibly there is a missing stage in this sequence which would render the first stage corrected, the second stage corrected and so on. The instance provided by the Pied Bull Lear of a corrected comma may point to a similar circumstance here. Several points helpfully establish the variant state of sig. D4r as the corrected and authoritative one. In the first change at l. 29 (II.i.364), the abnormally small space left between the speech prefix and the speech argues that Gal. , has been replaced by the longer heading, Open. , and a smaller space substituted for the quad between the new prefix Open. and the text. In addition, the variant arrangement splits between Tiltyard and Gallipot a speech formerly allocated to Gallipot alone (II.i.371 ff.; cf. the accompanying figure), and the variant catch words at the foot of sig. D4r explain this alteration. In the original setting the catch word, 'Come', is the first word of the initial speech on sig. D4r, but this omits the speech prefix: presumably the compositor, under the misapprehension that the speaker was already Gallipot, saw no reason to repeat it. The failure of correspondence between catch word and the first words on sig. D4v, the prefix Maist. Gal. (II.i.372), which precedes this speech, has in the absence of an alternative reading remained a curious anomaly. 3 Moreover, in the uncorrected state, the last speaker on sig. D4r is Master Gallipot, apparently making redundant the sig. D4v speech prefix. The reallocation of the final sig. D4r speech (II.i.371) to Master Tiltyard in the corrected version makes sense of the change of speaker signalled by the speech heading, Maist. Gal. , at the top of sig. D4v. Forty other instances of speech-heading catch words appear in the text and none of these includes the initial word of the character's speech: thus the corrected state appears to add the prefix to the previously existing catch word in an evident attempt to produce agreement between the direction line and the initial line, ' Maist. Gal. Come . . .', on the following sig. D4v. Also instructive is the case of sheet K of the Pied Bull Lear , in which a catch word was corrected in one forme to match an alteration in the other: 4 a correction to a forme first through the press which generated a disagreement would seem most unlikely. As Bowers has noted (Textual Introduction, vol. iii, p. 3), such corrections as do appear in the course of printing could have been made without reference to the manuscript. In the present instance, however, mere good sense could not have produced the prefix alterations; on this occasion correction may have been prompted by consultation of the printer's copy, or perhaps authorial intervention. As for their relative dramatic merits, the corrected readings on sig. D4r, allowing for the literary slightness of the alterations, are superior in several ways. The Tiltyards get short shrift earlier in the scene: this is Master Tiltyard's first appearance in the play and Mistress Tiltyard has been allowed a scant seven lines. 5 Here both are given brief speeches and business which help to justify their presence. Mistress Tiltyard, who is silent in the uncorrected version, is given a line, presumably to do with the labour of shutting up the shop—and in this the pair may be intended as objects of amusement since Master Tiltyard in his thorough preoccupation with the dogs leaves all the work to his wife. This vignette does not really square with the Gallipots, the former possessors of these lines, since, on the strength of his behaviour later, the solicitous Master Gallipot would be more likely to spring to his spouse's aid. But the special appeal of the reallocation to Mistress Openwork of the speech at l. 29 (II.i.364) almost single-handedly confirms the authority of the altered speech headings. Her tiff with her husband over Moll earlier in the scene and her new involvement with Goshawk prepare the ground for a reply of dramatic interest to Tiltyard's innocent question which, if given to Mistress Gallipot, is barely capable of rising above the merely informational. 6 A possible explanation for at least the first three of the errors may be found in the final word of Master Tiltyard's speech at l. 27 of sig. D4r where Openworke occurs as the sole occupant of a text line at the left side of the page among the speech prefixes. If, as the text was being set, the compositor mistakenly construed this as a speech heading in a manner similar to eye-slip (the italic headings would appear to have been set up separately in a set of quick exchanges such as this, as evidence adduced below suggests), the immediately following four prefixes may be seen to accord with those in the corrected version (i.e. the corrected sequence runs Open. , Gal. , Tilt. , Gal. , Gal. ; the uncorrected sequence skips the first Open. , and proceeds, Gal. , Tilt. , Gal. , Gal. ) Two lines given to the Gallipots then remain in their original setting (ll. 33 and 34; II.i.368-9). If this explanation is correct, the gender discrepancy between the two sequences at l. 29 may further indicate that the Maist. / Mist. sequence, which is correct in the earlier state, was set independently from the series of character abbreviations: again, possibly an error created by the kind of transfer noted below. The explanation advanced for the first few lines fails to account, however, for the errors in the final two speeches on the page, also given in the uncorrected state to the Gallipots. Confusion of some sort clearly reigned, but in this instance it would appear to have been of a different order and its precise nature remains a matter for speculation. Possibly some doubled-up or otherwise disordered arrangement of these short lines in the manuscript may have produced the appearance of a stint of speeches between the Gallipots. The set of errors significantly occurs on the final page of the inner forme where the discrepancy between the catch word and the first line of sig. D4v, the last page of the gathering, would not have been apparent if composition of the outer forme were incomplete when printing of the inner had begun. Such a circumstance would not be out of keeping with regular printing-shop practice, since the inner forme could be imposed and then printing begun after seven pages had been set. But the conditions of composing and printing The Roaring Girl appear to have been particularly tight, as reflected in procedures designed to spare type. The relatively small number of the early quartos which has survived does not encourage confident speculation, but the single instance of the corrected state among the twelve known copies suggests that correction occurred at a late stage. Just how late is problematic: evidence of one in twelve produces an unlikely figure of just over 8 per cent. of the white paper remaining. Writing of the Lear quarto, Greg observed, 'if the corrections came in when 80 or 90 per cent of the pulls had already been made, it would hardly be worth while altering the type' ( op. cit. , p. 192). But perhaps the errors were deemed serious enough to warrant correction, albeit near the end of the run: these are without doubt the most significant corrections recorded in this text. Consonant with late correction, the disjunction between sigs. D4r and D4v could well have escaped notice through much of the printing since sig. D4v may not have been composed until almost all of inner D had been machined. A late discovery of the catchword discrepancy and the prefix errors would further explain how an earlier alteration on sig. D4r could have been made independently 7 —possibly as a follow-up to an earlier, and now lost, stage of correction, as suggested above. Authorial involvement in the correction process cannot be entirely ruled out and could account for a late-stage correction, but no evidence for it exists elsewhere and the recognition of a failure in catch-word correspondence offers a plausible explanation which does not require either dramatist's presence. As a compositor's standard reference point, a catch-word error would naturally be more likely of notice than an internal error. Since no correction attended the beginning speech of sig. D4v, the sig. D4r catch-word alteration is not consequential, and hence does not exactly correspond to the instance of a corrected catch word on sig. K4r of the Pied Bull Lear . Further, the two-skeleton printing of Lear makes unavailable to the printing of The Roaring Girl the usual system of proof-correction which apparently brought that error to light, since in one-skeleton printing the formes would normally be corrected independent of each other. Whether the catch-word error and mistaken speech prefixes were found by accident or as a result of some regular procedure is a matter for speculation, but, barring authorial intervention, the mis-matched catch word offers the readiest logical explanation for its detection. The use of recurrent type as bibliographical evidence is now well established; The Roaring Girl provides numerous instances not simply of recurrent individual letters but of repeated whole or partial speech headings. The clearest and in many respects the most interesting example touches also on some textually problematic matters—matters which were originally the chief interest of my investigation and which led to observation of the re-used speech prefixes. Contrary to normal expectations, evidence provided by sheet I demonstrates clearly that the inner forme had completed its printing run before even the third page of outer I had been fully set. With its succession of relatively short speeches by the Mistresses Gallipot and Openwork and later, Master Gallipot, sheet I takes a heavy toll on the stock of italic capital M s. In inner I, which was first through the press, there are forty-five occurrences; this pattern characterizes much of outer I also. As a result, in the course of setting outer I, the stock was depleted and roman Ms substituted for italic. At l. 24 on sig. I3r, however, the italics resume: a condition which strongly suggests that a supply had just been released. That the run of inner I had been completed, and the forme, if not immediately distributed, was at least cannibalized for its store of italic M s in the course of setting sig. I3r of outer I, is confirmed by examination especially of faulty type in the speech headings after the recommencement of italic capitals. Of special interest, not only were the italic capitals transferred from inner to outer I, but in several instances the whole heading or a component comprising several letters was preserved intact. The manner of re-using previously set speech prefixes seen in these transfers and others noted below raises the possibility of a regular, though perhaps informal, procedure which could have figured in the run of sig. D4r errors. Certainly, a system which favoured retention of speech headings in constant use through several formes over immediate distribution makes perfect sense. As Bowers has noted, Moxon makes no mention of the practice of transferring running titles from forme to forme, 8 so his failure to mention re-use of speech prefixes in the specialized production of play texts is not surprising. Three speech headings on sig. I4r and two on sig. I1v which clearly recur on sigs. I3r and I4v respectively serve to demonstrate the procedure (numerous others are probably involved but the uniformity of their letter forms precludes certainty): at l. 24 on outer-forme sig. I3r, Mist. Gall. , is a direct lift from l. 24 of inner-forme sig. I4r including the undotted i and the damaged G ; at l. 26 on sig. I3r a nick in the right base of the initial M and the particular orientation of the double bent ll establish this as the same prefix as that at l. 32 on sig. I4r, but with the a removed to make Maist. into Mist. ; and at l. 29 the damaged n and the st ligature correspond to those seen in Maist. Open. in l. 1 of sig. I4r; in addition, a clear transfer from sig. I1v, l. 13 of a complete heading with a defective M occurs at l. 28 of sig. I4v; another at l. 37 of sig. I4v is possibly a repeat (with an a added) of that at l. 30 of sig. I1v. 9 All instances of prefixes drawn from inner I naturally involve the reset state of that forme ( Dekker , vol. iii, pp. 4-5). Significantly, depletion of the italics did not interrupt the process of composition. Of additional interest in sheet I, five speech prefixes on the first page of the unreset outer forme have clearly been taken directly from the final page of the outer forme of H; in this case the sequence is identical in both and the prefixes have been preserved as integral units. 10 Numerous other recurrences of traceable broken type similarly reveal a practice which corresponds to that noted by G. W. Williams in 'Setting by Formes in Quarto Printing' ( SB , 9 [(1958)], 46 ff.), in which he investigated a like shortage of italic M s in Creede's printing of Menechmi (1595). The important difference in the case of The Roaring Girl is that the exceptional frequency of italic M s is not consistent throughout the quarto. The transfer from inner I is accordingly a recourse available to Okes's compositor (only one appears to have been involved in the setting of sheet I) which is not to Creede's. Speech-prefix transfers are not unique to sheets H and I; other instances are observable in various parts of the text in which the essential condition of the continuance of a prefix into an adjacent forme is present and in which the fortunate repetition of defective type makes detection possible. With the exception of sheets D, K, and L, however, re-used headings are visible only in the formes of adjacent sheets rather than between the formes of a single sheet. 11 Important in assessing the significance and implications of speech-prefix transfers is establishing their relation to compositorial stints. Although G. R. Price's attempt to differentiate compositors' shares is less than satisfactory, with some significant adjustments and modifications, it is likely to provide as serviceable a division as the text will allow. 12 Determining compositorial shares in this text is a vexed and almost unassailable problem. By way of illustration, among the more convincing traits isolated by Price is the appearance of 'I'le' with and without apostrophe. The Game at Chesse manuscript, though some dozen or so years later, shows that Middleton was himself inconsistent in the use and placement of apostrophes in such contractions. The apostrophe may be a genuine compositorial trait; on the other hand, it may represent a faithful rendering of the printer's copy of the play, inconsistency included: the likelihood of fossils of Dekker's or Middleton's presence in the manuscript (the question of who was responsible is far from clear; see my 'Some Textual Notes', pp. 338-339), not to mention a scribe's, makes the whole matter infirm. The absence of apostrophe may in a similar way reflect a compositor's generally successful suppression of the manuscript usage; but other explanations, though less satisfactory for the purpose of distinguishing shares, may be equally valid. If the various tidbits of evidence are to be used at all they must be handled with great caution in the interests of avoiding the temptation to regard hints of brick-like forms as foundation blocks. In his initial plan Price sets out evidence for five compositors: as Bowers has remarked, an unlikely number for a one-press shop such as Okes's ( Dekker , vol. iii, p. 3 note). Price's research is not thorough, however, and is at points confused. He omits from his trait allocations instances of trait 'Z' ('Elsewhere the Sir of speech-heads is in italic.' p. 182) in compositor E's stint. 13 As this is the sole distinction between compositors D and E in his analysis, D and E are one and the same. Further, in his proposed conflation of compositors A, B, and C to produce one (A), and D and E another (D), the assignment of pages in the stints of each on several occasions fails to agree with the data provided in the five-fold division given immediately above. 14 In preference to a reduction of the evidence to two compositors (which may yet have some validity), Bowers favours three, retaining Price's A and joining B and C to make a second (B), and (like Price) D and E a third (D). According to this arrangement, A and B would appear to have set almost all of the early signatures, essentially from sheet B to part of sheet F, in a random sequence of alternation, and D almost all of the remainder, including most of the prelims. 15 According to this analysis, no occurrences of speech-heading transfers appear within A's share, although some which originate in his stint recur in another's: perhaps to be interpreted as further evidence for three compositors. Elsewhere recurrences of speech headings appear in the stints of both B and D, implying that the practice was not merely the idiosyncrasy of a single compositor. Although sheet I provides the only certain example, re-use may be generally related to type shortage or the danger of type shortage; but convenience and possibly speed would presumably figure also. Sheet F provides a point of special interest since it strains the stock even further, with fifty-five M s in the inner and forty-four in the outer forme, and does not resort to roman capitals. The case of italic M s would appear to be capable of meeting the needs of both formes of F but be insufficient for I. Significantly, the two or three compositors' stints meet in sheet F, so the likelihood is that at least two cases were used in setting the sheet and met the heavy demand for italic capital M s. A second case was clearly unavailable to sheet I which from all appearances was set by one compositor. 16 Type recurrences, whether single or comprising a whole or part speech heading, suggest that through most but not all of the text a single case was used to compose The Roaring Girl : an unusual circumstance since compositors are generally thought to have set from their own cases. Other instances of roman substitution in speech headings occur in the quarto but in stints too brief or too irregular to yield an identifiable cause or pattern. 17 Specially interesting, however, is a roman substitution for an italic I on sig. K3r, l. 14; here a distinctive k from the same Iack. Dap. speech heading is repeated from sig. K2r, l. 28, suggesting that the italic I s from inner K ought to have been free for use in outer K, but for some reason were not. The shortage continues into sheet L, so there is no reason to suppose that the outer forme was first through the press. Bowers has remarked on shortage of type as one possible reason for resort to one-skeleton printing: 18 a condition which clearly appears to have prevailed during the setting of this play. Yet since circumstances within the printed text of The Roaring Girl are unable to account for this and other shortage peculiarities, the likeliest explanation would seem to lie in some external draw on the type which helped to create depletions in certain letters: a proposition tentatively elaborated below. The emergence of roman Ms on sig. I2v when none appear in inner I, coupled with the resumption of italic in sig. I3r in speech headings which have been manifestly drawn from inner I, points to setting by formes as opposed to the seriatim procedure more usual in single-skeleton printing—at least where setting from manuscript is concerned. 19 R. K. Turner remarks in connection with the exceptional case of Thierry and Theodoret (printed by Okes in 1621), however, that setting by formes probably continued after composition was scaled down from two skeletons to one. 20 Of special interest to The Roaring Girl , he also notes this procedure's frugal use of type in single-skeleton printing: seriatim setting would require three more type-pages in any given sheet than are needed in forme setting to prepare the first forme of that sheet for the press. Its partial resetting renders sheet I unusual, but additional evidence which similarly betrays early distribution and setting by formes is found in sheets D, K, and L (perhaps also F: see above, note 16). In each, speech headings incorporating broken type may be seen in the inner and outer formes. Occurrences significantly early in both formes of sheets D, K, and L, moreover, nullify the force of an argument based on a possible random reversal of the regular precedence of the inner forme in the printing of this text. Instances of the same type in both formes of a sheet point additionally to delays in composition, which in turn appear to co-ordinate, in general at least, with a shortage rationale for setting by formes. Further, sheets which do not evince clear evidence of this kind are those in which a lengthy stretch of repeated speech headings does not run through both formes; so the absence of re-used italic type in headings or stage directions in no way demonstrates that those sheets were handled differently. Perhaps, bearing in mind D. F. McKenzie's cautions especially over the matter of setting by formes, 21 we should not leap too readily to the conclusion that this method was the norm throughout. But other evidence, admittedly of a less substantial nature, does agree with the notion: crowding in the form of doubled-up short speeches and generally less white space is almost exclusive to the first three pages of the outer forme in practically every sheet of the quarto. Other remarks by McKenzie in the same study are specially pertinent to the case of The Roaring Girl : "On the face of it, the most important reason for setting by formes in quarto is unlikely to have been urgency, nor even an unusually small fount, but a fount depleted because of concurrent printing—for if work overlapped on two or more books using the same fount of type, setting by formes would offer a method of making some progress with all." (p. 40). Although in the absence of a companion text or texts proof is impossible, conditions of concurrent printing would very likely have given rise to some arrangement for dove-tailing composition, proofing, correction, and press-work on single-skeleton books with those operations on other productions of the same shop. Some variation of the conventional two-skeleton proofing procedure described by Bowers could perhaps apply to work on two single-skeleton books. Clearly, further work is needed to shed light on the matter of concurrent printing in shops of this period; but fuller investigation may merely reveal the kind of evidence needed to support such a procedure as I have sketched to be beyond recovery. We know, however, from studies of the Pied Bull Lear and other play texts 22 that Nicholas Okes certainly had sufficient type in his single-press establishment to sustain two-skeleton work, perhaps three or more, so it does not unduly strain plausibility to consider that the formes of The Roaring Girl shared press time and other procedures with one or more other productions. Some type shortage oddities, setting by formes (demonstrable at least in a persuasive number of cases), and the disposition of press corrections, with seven out of eight sheets invariant in one forme and an absence of gross errors in the invariant formes, at a minimum raise suspicions that a procedure and a proof-correction system may have been adopted which corresponds in some adapted form to that seen in two-skeleton books. Further, if the formes of more than one book were being set up and wrought off in some pattern of alternation, the headlines and catch words would be the likeliest reference points when it came to perfecting for the avoidance of mismatching formes of one book with those of another and for alignment with the correct mate; and in this may lie a clue to the discovery of the sig. D4r errors. The glimpse afforded by The Roaring Girl quarto of an apparent procedure in Okes's shop involving the preservation of certain speech headings whole from wrought-off formes for later re-use, if observed in other texts of the period may provide valuable bibliographical evidence touching on such matters as order of formes through the press, setting by formes, type shortages, and progress of composition, some of which have already received attention in relation to simple type recurrences: the frequent repetition of speech headings through neighbouring formes provides a natural occasion for the adoption of such a system in one-skeleton printing. The Copy in the Beinecke Library, Yale University The previously unrecorded copy formerly owned by Norman Holmes Pearson, recently bequeathed to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale (shelf-mark 1977/2724), lacks all of sheet A and the blank M4; otherwise the copy is in excellent condition, with all running titles intact. The fine individual binding is modern. What I had earlier described as possibly an inking variant on sig. D4r ('Some Textual Notes', p. 342), is clearly not a poorly inked 'e' in this copy. If, as Bowers observes, Nicholas Okes was capable of stopping the press to correct a comma ( loc. cit. (1947), p. 43), the correction of a literal such as this is also plausible. The variant formes in the Yale copy are all in the corrected state except for uncorrected inner D. Inner I is in the original typesetting. For a record of the press variants, see Bowers's Dekker together with the additions and corrections noted in my earlier study ('Some Textual Notes', pp. 341-343).</field>

Many of these are incorporated in speech headings which may be seen to repeat also; but the regular letter forms which accompany them are frequently too difficult to trace with assurance. In addition to instances in which the same letter(s) occurs in both formes of a sheet, transfers between formes of adjacent sheets are of interest: evidently a further reflection of halting progress in the printing of this play. 11 Distinctive flawed letters occur in the following prefixes; so far as I am able to tell, the whole prefix is involved in each instance.

My own efforts to sort out stints based on traits other than those considered by Price have produced results which are either self-contradictory or at variance with and weaker than Price's findings. The exercise has, however, tempered my approach to the matter. 13 Sir Bewt. : K2r 2, 24; K3r 5, 30; K4v 17, 23; L1r 9. 14 A is given K4v, A2r, A3r, and A3v, which ought to belong to D; and D is assigned A4r and A4v which should fall to A. Price also cites the form 'nere' as distinctive of D and E although, according to my reckoning, with the single exception of 'ne're' on sig. C3v 36, this is the only form in which the word appears throughout the quarto; and it occurs more often in the so-called stints of A, B, and C than in those of D and E; 'bene', aligned with compositor E, appears with greater frequency in the shares of A and D. Also, Price curiously states that 'practically nothing of Middleton's spelling and punctuation stands out in the text' (p. 182)—a claim which takes no account of such forms as 'sh'has', ''has/has' ( he has), ''thad' and the like; and those forms cited as Dekker's preferred spellings are common in Middleton. 15 In an attempt to avoid confusion I have retained letters assigned by Price to distinguish compositors, conflating B and C (B), and D and E (D); the stints of the three compositors may be set out as follows: A: B1r-B2v, B3r (in part), B4v, D2r, D3r, E1r, E1v (in part), E2v-E4v, F1v-F2v, F3v, A4r ( Prologus ), A4v (Dramatis Personae). B: B4r, C1r-C2r, C2v-C4v , D1r, D1v, D2v , D4r , D4v , E1v, E2r, F4r , F4v . D: B3r (in part), B3v, D3v, F1r, F3r , G1r, G1v , G2r-G4v, H1r-H3v, H4r , H4v, I1r , I1v, I2r I2v-I3v , I4r, I4v, K1r-K4v, L1r-L2v, L3r-L4v , M1r-M2v, M3r-M3v ( Epilogus ), A2r (title-page), A3r-A3v ( Epistle ). I have retained Price's italics for signatures in which evidence is not strong. Evidence for D's presence in sheets B and D is not overwhelming and may be attributable to some aberration derived from inconsistency, as suggested above. 16 A pattern of re-use such as that seen in sheet I (also D, K, and L, as described above) is possible but not clearly demonstrable here: again, presumably an indication that another case was used. An instance of an M from inner F repeated in outer F appears to indicate that inner F was distributed before setting of outer F was completed, but the crisp, clear serifs of the M at l. 12 of sig. F3v are blurred in the counterpart at l. 33 of sig. F4v, although the distinctive internal dot is found in both. But perhaps the type was slightly damaged at this point: none of the later appearances preserves the clarity seen until this stage (see above, note 10, no. 1). Other possible candidates (also M s) occur at l. 26 on sig. F2r and l. 14 on sig. F4v; at l. 36 on sig. F3v and l. 22 on sig. F2v. Although no wholesale transfer of headings such as that in sheet I is apparent, the possibility for it remains, though hidden in the regular forms of undamaged type. 17 Apparent shortages may be seen on sig. H4r ( S ) and sigs. K4r to L2r inclusive ( I ). In neither case does the forme in which it appears or the immediately preceding one reveal a specially heavy use of the letter, and the evidence suggests that the compositor was the same in all. 18 'Elizabethan Proofing', Joseph Quincy Adams Memorial Studies , ed.

      <field name="heading_text">The Derby MS Book of Cotton's Poems and "Contentation" Re-Considered by Alvin I. Dust</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Numerous scholars and bibliophiles 1 have consulted the Derby MS 2 book of poems by Charles Cotton (1630-1687), but only one 3 has treated this literary artifact as a book, open to the principles of analytical bibliography. This paper shall attempt a closer analysis and will, perhaps, clarify problems concerning the MS of Cotton's "Contentation." Earlier articles about this poem 4 were based upon microfilm copies or second-hand information which have proved unreliable or have led to incomplete information. 5 For describing DBL MS, pagination, though rather erratic, offers some aid. At present, the volume opens with one loose, unnumbered leaf and the stubs of several leaves wanting. The next succeeding pages still adhering to the binding are numbered 1-31, within parentheses. Then the verso following p. 31 is unnumbered but the next recto is properly designated 33, without parentheses. The practice of numbering only rectos but preserving the series (i.e., p. 34 is unnumbered, but 35 carries 35, etc.) 6 continues with few omissions until 258, the last of the present pages, but in this closing again occur stubs of several removed leaves. Besides opening and closing excisions, a few medial leaves have been cancelled or roughly torn out. Fortunately for bibliographic study, the DBL MS is somewhat shaken in its binding, likely caused by accelerated usage since the 1938 announcement by Turner of its location. 7 This looseness allows careful examination of a majority of the unsigned gatherings. On the basis of this knowledge, one can infer an original collation, which, I suggest, should read: 2 , [A-S] 8 (omitting, as usual, J from the series). Succeeding comments will be offered in support of this collation. It is fairly easy to arrive at what must have been the original gatherings B and C and only slightly more difficult to deduce the A gathering because of the present weak state of the binding and because of the missing leaves of gathering A. Here one must rely on further evidence from watermarks. All the paper of the MS pages, plus those now held by Yale, to which I shall refer later, came from one source. The folio sheet contained a watermark in one half of the sheet similar to that shown as Gaskell's horn design, 8 if one compares examples of both. One notes that the horn, as in his illustration, is turned, opening to the left and mouthpiece to the right, but the DBL MS design is somewhat embellished with additional scrolls and the horn sits on a plinth with the letters G DVRAND, likely the name of the maker or the paper-house. Above the horn is a further design from which a circlet is pendant, holding the carrying cord for the horn. Chain and wire lines appear as expected. Measurement of the sheet is not here relevant, since the MS edges have deteriorated so far that present size in relation to the original could only reflect guesswork, not bibliographically dependable. The second half of each sheet contained no countermark. 9 Now to return to the collation. Gathering B. easily lifted free from the stitching and therefore readily revealing conjugancy of leaves, contains four sheets, the leaves of which are designated B1-8, with sewing occurring in the gutter between B4 and B5. B4 is an 'O' leaf, B5 is watermarked; B3 contains a watermark, but B6 is an 'O' leaf; B1 and 2 are 'O' leaves, but B7 and 8 have watermarks. From this exposition one can infer that the original state of A gathering was likely also a gathering in eights, but has suffered loss of leaves. At present one has a loose, unnumbered leaf with the watermark, a series of stubs before the gutter, stitching in the gutter between stubs and four succeeding leaves, the first three of which show watermarks, and the fourth is an 'O' leaf. These latter four leaves are now paginated 1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6; and 7, 8. By the watermarks one can now assert that the present, loose unnumbered leaf, with watermark, was originally A1, conjugate with A8, and that A2, 3, 4 are wanting 'O' leaves. The stitching, as in B gathering, was made between A4 (missing) and A5, which has a watermark as A6, 7 have watermarks. A8, an 'O' leaf, therefore, was, no doubt, the conjugate of the loose, watermarked leaf, designated A1. Gathering C shows stitching between C4 and C5: C4 is an 'O' leaf and C5 carries the watermark. The same is true of C3 and C6; C3 is an 'O' leaf and C6 is watermarked. In C2 and C7, C2 has the watermark and C7 is an 'O' leaf. In the final sheet of this gathering, C1 is 'O' and C8 is watermarked. D gathering presents a minor problem in that it exhibits a neatly excised leaf now represented by only a trimmed stub between D4 and D2. The conformation of the gathering is this: D4, watermarked, is conjugate with D5, an 'O' leaf; D3 (missing), a watermarked leaf, was conjugate with 'O' leaf D6, and D2 and 1, watermarked, are conjugates of 'O' leaves D7, 8. At present the pages are numbered 41-50, with the stub of the removed leaf in the gap following pp. 43-44, therefore D3. Since the poem " To my Friend Mr. John Anderson. From the Countrey " (POSO 10 , pp. 376-380, Bb4v-Bb6v) in eight stanzas, 64 lines, begins on pp. 44 and continues without interruption past the former position of the cancelled leaf, one would have to reason here that Cotton took a single leaf to the binder, or perhaps his amanuensis gave the MS to the binder with the instruction to cancel a messy leaf on which part of the " To Anderson" poem was written, but then re-written more legibly on the following leaf. The E and F gatherings seem, physically, on the surface, to cause no problems, appearing to conform to the pattern of gatherings of eights, but a study of watermarks dispels quick solution if one considers mis-ordering of poetic contents of the involved pages. It appears that, long after binding, perhaps in the present century, a series of leaves at the end of gathering E and the opening of F had become dis-bound, and a former owner, least likely a library curator, used glue to adhere the loose leaves to those more secure, by tipping in four single leaves. Apparently a modern glue, which is colorless, fastens together gutter sides of E6, 7, 8, and F1, now deterring further investigation. In gathering E, sewing appears in the regular position between E4 and 5; the former contains the watermark, the latter is 'O'. E3 and 6 are both 'O' leaves when one should show a watermark, and E2 and 7 are both watermarked, when one should be 'O'. E1 and 8 are both 'O'; one should be watermarked. The F gathering is sewn between F4 and 5, the former watermarked, the latter 'O'. The gathering shows watermarks in acceptable positions, except for what appears to be a sheet comprising F1 and 8; both signatures are watermarked when one should be 'O'. These two gatherings are now numbered (in modern times) from pp. 55-86, though the contents of only a few of these pages figure in the mis-ordering of the poetry. Chappel first called attention to the problem when he wrote: "At this point [p. 65 in the MS] two folio sheets have been folded back to front and their positions reversed; the correct order is pp. 71, 72, 69, 70, 67, 68, 65, 66." 11 A chart of the mis-ordered poems follows: Title Description DBL Reference POSO Reference " An Ode of Johannes Secundus. To my dear Tutor Mr. Ralph Rawson." 4 stanzas, 16 lines p. 71 (12 lines) and p. 72 (last 4 lines) pp. 547-548, (Nn2) "Elegy" 66 lines p. 72 (10 lines), p. 69 (next 14 lines), p. 70 (next 13 lines), p. 67 (next 14 lines), p. 68 (next 13 lines), p. 65 (last 2 lines) pp. 382-385, (Bb7v-Cc1r) " Love's World, Translated out of Astrea." 11 stanzas, 44 lines p. 66 (3 stanzas, 12 lines), p. 73 (4 stanzas, 16 lines), and p. 74 (4 stanzas, last 16 lines) pp. 549-552, (Nn3r-Nn4v) Chappel in his discussion did not note gatherings of the DBL MS nor watermarks; likely he considered that mis-ordering involved only one gathering. Perhaps, also, when he examined DBL MS, the binding was in a more solid shape than now. Let me suggest that, at some time in the past, those leaves that now appear to be E6 (now pp. 65-66), E7 (now numbered 67-68), E8 (now 69-70) and F1 (now 71-72) became detached and were, in the interest of preservation, glued in, in reverse order. This well-meaning preserver, who became a meddler, should have placed the leaves in the following order: Present F1 (now 71-72) in the position of E6, E8 (now 69-70) for E7, E7 (now 67-68) for E8, and E6 (now 65-66) for F1, exactly in the order in which Chappel said the poems should be read. If one follows this reasonable order, then the problem of watermarks and 'O' leaves in gatherings E and F becomes regularized. Note that, if the gluer had replaced the pages properly, we would then find, in gathering E, E1, and 'O' leaf, conjugate with F7 (formerly E8) with watermark; E2, watermark, conjugate with E8 (formerly E7) an 'O' leaf; E3, an 'O', conjugate with F1, watermark. By this plan E gathering is regularized. Also in F gathering, by substituting E6, an 'O' leaf, for the present F1, conjugancy of E6 with present F8, watermarked, is also regularized. And the poetic order of Chappel is likewise satisfied. Here admittedly minor supporting evidence can be offered. In the DBL MS dust stains appear on the edges of pp. 65, 69, 71, and 72 (present E6, E8, F1) which suggest that these pages had been dis-bound and exposed to the atmosphere, a likely occurrence when they were loose before gluing. No problems occur in gatherings G-O, but in P gathering appears a stub following P1, now numbered pp. 215-216. Watermarked and 'O' leaves alternate as they should for regular sheets in G-O. Study is facilitated by the fact that gatherings L and M can be now lifted free from the binding, revealing their original state as sewn in gatherings of 8. All other gatherings in this group show stitching in the gutter between each 4 and 5 signature leaves. P gathering, however, follows this formation: P1 is 'O' and P8 carries the watermark; P2, presumably watermarked, is missing, and its conjugate P7 is an 'O' leaf; P3 is 'O' and P6 has a watermark; sewing comes between P4, watermarked, and P5, an 'O' leaf. Q gathering is complete with Q1, 2, and 3 as 'O' leaves and Q6, 7, and 8 as watermarked; Q4 is watermarked and P5 is an 'O' leaf. The final two gatherings, designated R and S, are so defective, resulting from removed leaves, that one can only make reasoned conjectures as to their original state. A re-constituted make-up of gatherings R and S, to what they probably were originally, will help considerably study of the now separate MS of Cotton's "Contentation" and another, shorter MS, in the James Marshall and Marie-Louise Osborn Collection of Yale University Library. 12 The remaining leaves of DBL MS are now paginated 245-258; here I shall first consider only two leaves (pp. 245-246 and pp. 247-248) as the survivals of a regular gathering of 8. Each of these two leaves, by the presence of a corresponding stub, shows loss of its conjugate. If the first leaf (pp. 245-246) is given the signature R1, then its missing conjugate was R8; the second, R2 (pp. 247-248), has lost its conjugate, R7. Very loose sewing occurs in the gutter between R2 and the stub of missing R7. It is also plausible that R3, 4, 5, and 6, 4 leaves, have been detached, at some time, from this gathering. The original state of gathering R may have been R1 (pp. 245-246), an 'O' leaf; R2 (pp. 247-248), another 'O' leaf; R3 [which I paginate as 247a and 248a], now wanting; R6 [247b and 248b], now wanting; R5 [247c and 248c], now wanting; R6[247d and 248d], now wanting; R7 [247e and 248e], now wanting, except for its short, ragged stub, and, no doubt, watermarked; R8 [247f and 248f], now wanting except for its stub, and with watermark. For R3-6, I will not even venture a guess at this time, about watermarks; that will come later when I shall make further statements about these missing leaves. Here I should like to press on to the final gathering, S 8 . Of S 8 , we now have pp. 249-258, which follow this pattern: S1 (pp. 249-250) with watermark; S2 (pp. 251-252), watermark; S3 (pp. 253-254), watermark; S4 (pp. 255-256), watermark, followed by sewing and three stubs standing for S5, S6, and S7 [pp. 255a-256a, 255b-256b, 255c-256c], and S8 (pp. 257-258), an 'O' leaf, the final in the volume. Because of the loose binding one knows that the leaf (pp. 249-250), watermarked, is one half of the sheet whose other half is pp. 257-258, an 'O' leaf. Now that the suggested original collation is complete, I can return to the two Yale MSS. The first, "Contentation", consists of three folio leaves, of which the first recto is blank, the first verso and the following two rectos and versos are filled with writing; the Cromwell MS is only one folio leaf with writing on both sides. 13 Physically both Yale MSS appear to have been dis-bound from the R gathering of DBL MS, but one must also dispel the possibility that Cromwell MS is the missing leaf of P gathering (P2, following p. 216). In DBL MS margins have been drawn, about one inch in depth, on both right and left edges of pages, in characteristic ink, which has faded to sepia, for pp. 5-85; pp. 86-144 omit margins; pp. 145-216 have light pencilled margins with an occasional horizontal line across each top; but beginning with p. 217 (P3r) and continuing to the end of the volume, right and left margins, a horizontal rule at the bottom of each page, a double rule down each page center, and a horizontal double bar at the top of each page, appear in red ink. Because these red lines appear in "Contentation" MS and because of its length, doubtless that MS was dis-bound from R gathering where it would fit positions of suggested R3-5. Again one must refer to watermarks. R1 and 2 are 'O' leaves; "Contentation", first leaf, is 'O' and therefore could fit the position of R3; "Contentation", second leaf, is watermarked, thus filling the position of R4, conjugate with missing R5, which would have had to have been 'O' as is the third leaf of "Contentation". Remaining leaves of S gathering are all watermarked; no position in this gathering fits "Contentation" MS. Earlier 14 I had argued that the writing of "Contentation" occurred "After 1676, before Walton's death, 15 December 1683" when I could not be assured that the MS had indeed been once part of DBL MS. The supposed position in R gathering would have the poem succeeding the monogram "W. F." (William FitzHerbert) and the comment "Vivat poeta. | Jan. 14 1666" which appear on p. 244 (Q8v). One might therefore suggest a time of writing as much as ten years earlier than the earliest date (1676) originally set forth. A study about the Cromwell MS brings up ostensibly heterogeneous sources of information, such as the contents of the disordered gatherings E and F of the DBL MS, publication of a poem in POSO, autobiographical and genealogical information about Cotton, and ownership of the DBL MS at the time that the poems in R gathering were transcribed; yet all of these elements can be carefully inter-related. In DBL MS, p. 72 (now F1v, but should be E6v) contains the last lines of the poem " An Ode of Johannes Secundus. To my dear Tutor Mr . Ralph Rawson" and the opening of "Elegy". In the space after the last line of "Rawson" and before the first line of "Elegy" appear these notes: Made of y e Lady MC: by C C 15 y e Author of this booke 16 An Elegie 17 Mary upon the Lady [Elizabeth] Fitzherbert 18 by Charles Cotton Esq Perhaps the first, and easiest, conclusion to arrive at is that the poem in POSO, entitled "Elegy", which has no addressee as sub-title, contains the same number of lines, and reproduces, almost verbatim, the text in DBL MS, gathering E, came from an independent MS with no sub-title. Though the Cromwell MS is without doubt the same poem, it is headed "Upon my Lady Mary FitzHerbert by Charles Cotton, Esq r " and shows significant variation from the other two texts. In the following selective chart of readings, it may be assumed that POSO agrees with DBL MS, so slight is the variation between the two: Line(s) DBL MS Cromwell MS 1 . . . was I blest . . . . . . . blest was I . . . . 16 . . . condemned . . . . . . . condemn'd . . . . 24 . . . beauties . . . . . . . beauty . . . . 31-34 But . . . spright, [4 lines missing] 49 Against a love . . . . And against love . . . . 51 . . . beauties . . . . . . . beauty . . . . 56 . . . truth, . . . youth [crossed out, "truth" substituted] 61 Teach her that too . . . . Tell her that too . . . . 62 Too little to provoke her love Too little to prevale with her to love Enough variation is shown by the chart to state that Cromwell MS is not merely an attempt, by re-copying, to create order out of the misordering of the poem in E and F gatherings of the main body of present DBL MS, unless one wants to accuse the writer of Cromwell MS of more than nodding over the task at hand. More credible is that Cromwell MS was copied from an independent MS of the poem. Further one could say that, once Cromwell MS had been written into the bound volume, anyone could have discovered that the poem occurred earlier, and, as a direction to readers, could have added the note "upon the Lady Elizabeth Fitzherbert" and then corrected his mistake by changing "Elizabeth" to "Mary". 19 Some slight evidence may be derived from the fact that the Cromwell MS has "my Lady" and "FitzHerbert" instead of "the Lady" and "Fitzherbert" of the F gathering; the "my" sounds more personal and the family of FitzHerberts most closely associated with Cotton preferred the medial capital "H" within their names. 20 The intimate relationship between the FitzHerbert and the Cromwell and Cotton families lends further support to Turner's supposition that the FitzHerbert family owned the DBL MS at some time in its history. 21 Though one can go far afield in suppositions of this type, it might not be out of order to suppose that a later member of the FitzHerbert family crossed out the F gathering sub-title, leaving only "Made of y e Lady MC" as a seemingly ambiguous enough addressee. Further, one might say that the person who defaced the MS at this point was unaware that a copy of the poem, without its revealing heading, was still in existence; therefore, it seems that, at the time of defacement, the DBL MS had already lost the Cromwell leaf. Otherwise what good would it have done to try to eliminate the former addressee on F1v? These comments may seem more reasonable if one investigates possibilities for identification of "MC". Other comments, once identification has been made, might give rise to probable dating of the poem and its occasion. The likeliest identification for "MC" is someone named Mary Cromwell, for two women, closely associated with the Cottons and the FitzHerberts, were, at times in their lives, called by that name. The first is Mary, daughter of William Russell of Strensham County, Worcestershire, who married Wingfield, Baron Cromwell and Earl of Ardglass (d. 1668). Close association with these Cromwells is reflected in Cotton's naming one of his sons, his third child, Wingfield (baptized 1662, d. 1663), certainly not a common name and one derived from a surname in the Cromwell family. About 1675, Baroness Mary Russell Cromwell, now a widow, became the second wife of Charles Cotton, his first wife having died in April 1669. The poem, a love-lament, seems an inappropriate address to the wife of a close friend, and phrases such as "blooming youth" and a "Gather-ye-rosebuds-while-you-may" 22 tone likely would not fit the maturity of a widowed Baroness Cromwell. The second Mary Cromwell is a sister-in-law to the Baroness, for she is the sister of Wingfield Cromwell, who became Mary Cromwell FitzHerbert, wife to William, the Lord of Tissington Hall, only about a mile away from Cotton's home in Dove Dale. Through the Beresford line, Cotton was already distantly related to the FitzHerberts; 23 by his second marriage, he became more closely related to them. Not only does Mary Cromwell FitzHerbert fit the "MC" of the DBL MS, but she also satisfies the second addressee of the poem, now scored out in the DBL MS, but present in the Cromwell MS. Because of its tone and its initial position in E gathering of DBL MS, it follows that the poem was addressed to Mary Cromwell before her marriage, and, possibly, before Cotton's marriage in 1656 to his first wife, Isabella Hutchinson. Turner (Thesis, pp. 34, 46) discusses the autobiographical content of Cotton's poetry, especially those poems reflecting his courtship of Isabella. All of the Isabella poems which appear in DBL MS precede one entitled "Christmas Day, 1659" (POSO, pp. 175-177, P3r-P4v) as does this "Elegy". The amorous tone of the "Elegy" leads us to believe that, if it was directed to Mary Cromwell, it was probably written about the same time as his poems to Isabella, for either Cotton's or Isabella's family (or both families) disapproved of, and tried to discourage, the courtship; they may even have encouraged his looking elsewhere for a marriage partner. At any rate, the youthful "Elegy" may have been Cotton's lament at rejection of his advances by Mary and a plea for reconsideration. If, indeed, the Cromwell MS was part of DBL MS when William FitzHerbert was still living, he broad-mindedly saw nothing in the poem at which he would take exception, but possibly someone in the family, later, found cause to disrupt association of the poem with Mary Cromwell FitzHerbert, and, by allowing the "MC" to stand, thought that those letters could as easily identify Mary Russell Cromwell Cotton. The Cromwell MS consists of one leaf only, with the horn watermark. Definitely one could say that this MS could represent any of three leaves, still undiscovered, but believed missing from postulated R gathering (R6, 7, or 8), and also that it was not dis-bound from S gathering, the missing pages of which must have been 'O' leaves. Also, though the missing leaf P2 (following pp. 215-216) was likely watermarked and therefore Cromwell MS could satisfy this position on that score, the stub that remains between P1 and P3 is too jagged, too much paper remains, to fit the well-preserved edges of Cromwell MS, which is a nearly complete half-sheet showing clearly the holes through which it was originally sewn into the binding. One must settle for a position in R gathering where it originally had its place near to "Contentation" MS, perhaps directly following, in the position of R6. Only one final statement needs to be made: the Yale-Osborn MSS were indeed once part of DBL MS.</field>

Here I should like to correct the second paragraph of the article, scrambled in printing; it should read: "No fault is to be found with Parks' statement, 'Two hands are evident in the Osborn-Yale MS'—Cotton's for the first stanza and the title, and that of an amanuensis.

In my copy to the printer I did not mention the number of hands in the DBL MS, nor suggest that Parks was incorrect in limiting the hands to two in Osborn-Yale MS. 5 In the article in The Library (above, n. 4) I admitted use of microfilm when I said (p. 317): "A microfilm of the DBL MS bears out Turner's statements." But Turner ("Thesis" p. 332), though he does mention removal of leaves from DBL MS, does not particularize in noting how many leaves are now missing, nor how their removal affects the make-up of the book. Parks' remark: "According to Peter Croft, head cataloguer of Sotheby's, who examined the Derby manuscript with some care . . . ." (See Parks, p. 157) reveals his dependence on another's observations; I doubt that, at time of writing, Parks had seen other than a microfilm of DBL MS. Clearly both of us have shown that a microfilm can go only so far in reproducing the realities of a MS book. I was able, only recently, to see the MS when I visited Derby during a sabbatical granted by the University of Waterloo. Here I wish to thank Mr. L. Greaves and Mrs. A. R. Mellors for their kind assistance. Still more recently, aided by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada supplementary travel grant, another visit allowed more close study, thanks also to the assistance of Miss Sylvia Brown, who facilitated my work. 6 No doubt, if the MS was so numbered when Turner consulted it, this practice of numbering allowed him to consider the MS foliated; all his references are cited in folio numbers. The first 31 numbers are in contemporary hand, but all subsequent ones are in modern script. 7 I am somewhat disturbed by the deterioration between my two visits to the Library; if, however, the Library should decide to re-bind, possibilities of further studies of this type—I hope not necessary—will be diminished. The collation suggested in this paper is far different from one I would have inferred several years ago, when the MS was more tightly encased in its binding. 8 Gaskell, Philip. A New Introduction to Bibliography , reprinted with corrections (1974), fig. 33, p. 69. 9 In subsequent references to leaves of the MS, I shall designate them as "watermarked" if such is true or as 'O' leaves, if they represent examples that contain no watermark (i.e. those conjugates which, for many paper-houses, carry counter-marks). Though Dard Hunter. Papermaking . The History and Technique of an Ancient Craft (1943) does not mention counter-marks, Ronald B. McKerrow. An Introduction to Bibliography (1928) says, "Later papers, from about 1670 (?), often have a second watermark, termed a 'counter-mark' and generally consisting of the maker's initials, in the centre of the opposite half of a sheet", p. 103. If his date be accepted as firm, and if, as I believe, the manuscript was written much earlier than that date, then one can understand why no counter-marks appear. Also, as McKerrow states, such marks usually consisted of initials, already covered by the "G. DVRAND" of the DBL MS paper. 10 Cotton, Charles. Poems on several Occasions . London: Printed for Tho.

Dr. Parks generously deposited photo-copies of these MSS in the Derby Municipal Library, where scholars could consult them in comparison with DBL MS; he also submitted a facsimile of the watermark, indicating which leaves are watermarked, which are 'O'. At the time of writing the former articles (see n. 4, above), the second, shorter MS had not appeared on the book market. 13 For brevity, the first of these MSS I call "Contentation" MS and the second, Cromwell MS, for reasons that later shall become clear. I have no other identifying marks for these MSS. 14 Article in The Library (see above, n. 4), p. 321. 15 Inter-twined C's, back to back, a monogram for Charles Cotton. 16 This line, and the one preceding it, is in a hand different from that of the end of the "Rawson" poem. 17 It appears that the "Rawson" hand also wrote the title "An Elegie" and the opening line of the poem itself. 18 This line and the one following it are in a third hand, much like that of Cromwell MS; it is difficult to be sure, however, since some writer has tried to obliterate these lines. It is clear enough, though, that the name "Elizabeth" was written, then crossed out, so that "Mary" could be substituted. 19 DBL MS contains a poem headed "On Lady Elisabeth Cromwells Birth Day by Coll: Coderington" on pp. 253-254 (S3), followed by a blank page. The mistake of "Elizabeth" for "Mary", soon discovered, may have been a memorial carry-over from having read this poem and from having realized a close relationship among the Cromwell, FitzHerbert, and Cotton families. 20 Editors of Derbyshire Countryside, Ltd.

      <field name="heading_text">Hidden Editions in Satires I and II of Edward Young's The Universal Passion by James E. May</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Edward Young published his Love of Fame satires first as seven separate folios entitled The Universal Passion between January 1725 and February 1728. 1 All bear the imprint "Printed for J. ROBERTS in Warwick-Lane ," and the first five published, Satires I-IV and The Last (VII), were entered by James Roberts to Jacob Tonson in the Stationers' Register. 2 Two almost indistinguishable editions of Satires I and II were printed, yet there was no acknowledgement of second folio editions within advertisements of the period. 3 The same title-page layout and ornament, head- and tail-pieces, and ornamental initials were used in the two sets of editions, and their letterpress seems to have been deliberately set to increase their resemblance. Their resemblance is so close that Charles E. Frank, who examined copies of all four editions while preparing a bibliography of the editions of Love of Fame , failed to discern the hidden editions (pp. 155-156). But, as David Foxon first noted in his English Verse 1700-1750 , there are two distinct editions of both Satire I (Foxon's Y122 and Y124) and Satire II (Y125 and Y127). 4 One edition of each satire (Y122 and Y125) was also issued in fine-paper with a fleur-de-lys mark and an "IV" countermark. 5 Both editions of Satire I and II can be distinguished by press figures and by two accidental variants. 6 Apparently, Foxon identified as first editions those he denominated Y122 and Y125 because they contain fine-paper issues and because the copies deposited in libraries as part of the Stationers' Company's registration process belong to these editions. However, I present here typographical evidence that the edition of Satire II that Foxon places second (Y127) was printed first. Then, in consequence of Y127's priority, and with what is known of the satires' publication, I would further argue the priority of the Y124 edition of Satire I. I conclude by speculating what may have led those concerned to publish the four editions within so short a period and to conceal their multiplicity. Foxon incorrectly observes that edition Y127 was "Reset, with the exception of the title and half-title" (I, 919, Y127). Whereas the text and ornaments on the title (A2) are the same, there are typographical differences. The inside vertical rule on the left is shorter in all copies of Y127 seen, not extending beyond the inside-bottom horizontal rule as it does in copies of Y125 (in the Princeton copies, this rule is 270 mm. in Y127 and 273.5 in Y125). More importantly, the capital ' T ' in ' Tanto ' (within the motto) is broken off at the top right serif in all copies of Y125, but not damaged in any copy of Y127 which I have seen. If we discount the difference in rule length and suppose the title has not been reset, the broken ' T ' in Y125 argues that its edition was machined after Y127, which controverts Foxon's ordering of the editions. Furthermore, Foxon appears to be unaware that forme inner B is shared by both editions of Satire II. The irrefutable evidence that Y125 represents a second edition derives from damaged type on this forme. The identity of the type-setting for forme B i can be seen from the following pieces of damaged type found in both editions: 'a' in 'What's' and 'h' in 'wealth' (B1 v , line 1), 's' in 'short-' (B1 v , 3), 's' in 'smit' (B1 v , 5), 'h' in 'the' (B1 v , 6), ' p ' and ' u ' in ' Epictetus ' (B1 v , 8), 'k' in 'like,' 'h' in 'them,' and 'e' in 'the' (B1 v , 10), 'T' in 'Thy' (B1 v , 11), 'e' in 'The' and 't' in 'to' (B1 v , 14), 'e' in 'some' and 'l' in 'peculiar' (B1 v , 15), 'h' in 'the' (B1 v , 19), 'b' in 'books' (B2, 3), 'e' in 'when' (B2, 5), 'o' in 'choice' (B2, 6), 'w' in 'whole' (B2, 7), 's' in 'cost' and the second 'e' in 'succeed' (B2, 17), 'w' in 'who,' 'e' in 'the,' and the second 'e' in 'expence' (B2, 21). There are differences between Y125 and Y127 at the line-endings, but these can be explained as the results of moving stored type. These differences are greater on B1 v , where lines 6 and 11-14 have different relative line-lengths. The increased length of Y125's line 6 is due to the substitution of a wide 'W' for a narrow one in 'Wit'. The only other typographical substitution occurs in the question mark at the end of line 1, the longest line on B1 v . The mark in Y125 does not reach above the 'r' in 'power' as that of Y127 does. On B2 the lines end in the same relative position. Here two end-line punctuation marks are altered. Y125 substitutes a smaller question mark at the end of line 6 and a semicolon for a question mark used for exclamation at the end of line 14. The extent and position of these alterations suggests that they resulted from the removal and reintroduction of the setting within the skeleton. The altered position of the bracketed page number relative to the first line of B1 v argues that at least B1 v , with the more typographical disturbance, was removed from the skeleton. (Examination of the Princeton copies of both editions with a Hinman collator also reveals these to be shared settings.) Given the general identity of the two settings for B i , it is significant that Y125's has damaged type that does not appear in Y127's. Yet there is no damaged type in Y127's setting that does not appear in Y125's; thus, the setting that printed Y125 must have been damaged during a later, second impression. Since in Y125's setting the newly-broken type-pieces occupy the same position relative to other type-pieces that they do in Y127's, it seems unlikely that they result from resetting. Broken letter-type found only in the setting for Y125 include: 'f' in 'of' (B1 v , line 4), 'f' in 'of' (B1 v , 16), 'O' in 'Or' (B1 v , 17), 'f' in 'of' (B2, 1), 'y' in 'buy' (B2, 7), and 'T' in 'Terms' (B2, 11—unbroken in some copies). Only the 'y' in line 7 of B2 occurs close to the line-ending and may result from substitution, but it occupies exactly the same position relative to lines above and below and is closely preceded by type damaged in both editions. The strongest evidence that Y125 was machined second derives from the 'T' in 'Terms' (B2, l. 11). In the Harvard, Texas (WK Y858 B726u), Bath (unbound) and Indiana copies of Y125, the 'T' is not broken, and in the Michigan copy, it is cracked but no space exists between the upper and lower halves. But in the Library Company of Philadelphia and the Yale copies, the two halves of the 'T' are separated. Since in no copy of Y127 seen is the 'T' damaged, Y127 must have been impressed before Y125. Although this typographical argument does not indicate which edition of Satire I is the first, it does offer a suggestion. Since the Y127 edition of Satire II is usually found bound with the Y124 edition of Satire I, I would argue that these represent the respective first editions. 7 Such an ordering fits the known facts about the publication and registration of Satire I. This satire seems first to have been advertised in the Post-Boy of 21-23 January 1725 (#5541). Yet the satire was not entered in the Stationers' Register until 9 April 1725. Since both editions of Satire I bear the advertisement " The Second Satire is now in the Press " (on E2), both probably preceded the April publication of Satire II. Since, then, both preceded registration, there is no a priori reason why the deposit copies for Satire I should have come from the first edition. Rather, it seems likely that the edition from which the deposit copies did not come (Y124) had sold out. An additional argument for the priority of Y124 will be offered in the discussion of the circumstances of its publication which follows. We have, then, the peculiar printing of two editions with remarkable resemblance for two satires before the registration process was completed. I believe these facts must be explained with reference to Young's planned subscription and his sale of the satires' copyrights to Jacob Tonson. Young had planned to solicit subscribers for an edition of his works, or of the satires, during the winter months when Satire I was published, as he had indicated to Thomas Tickell in a letter dated 10 October 1724. 8 On 2 March 1725, Young wrote Tickell that "Since my Last to you I have set a subscription a foot," which would have been within a month of Satire I, as his last extant letter to Tickell is dated 14 December 1724 (Pettit, Correspondence , pp. 38-40). But Young seems not to have advertised for subscribers until 1726, when he proposed a three-volume collected works. Whether the subscription Young wrote of in 1724-25 involved the collected satires, as Frank proposed in 1939, or his collected works, as Trevor Mills assumed in 1980, cannot be determined. 9 I see the failure to advertise for subscribers in March and April of 1725 as, at the very least, a postponement of whatever was planned. But, regardless of which of the two Young intended to publish, the postponement of the subscription would have opened the market for an expensive fine-paper issue of the satires. I would hypothesize that Young intended to publish the later satires in a subscription edition and had Satires I and II printed to drum up interest in the subscription. Young hired Roberts as a trade publisher to help distribute the work, although Roberts may also have printed it. Young invested just enough money to have limited editions of Satires I and II printed, only the copies needed to initiate the subscription effort before being sold out. This explains why there are fewer extant copies of Y124 and Y127. For some reason, perhaps having planned to all along, Young sold the copyright to Jacob Tonson, probably between the letter of 2 March and the registration on 9 April. Young may have sold the rights at this time because their apparent success assured a good price from Tonson for the satires. Young now needed money as is evident from the importunity of his letters to Tickell. 10 Most likely, Young feared that enough subscribers could not soon be found but that, with the successful run of all the satires, or of the first five, they might be. Thus, with the subscription postponed or looking precarious, Tonson or Young brought out Y122 and Y125 with fine-paper issues for the wealthier readers who would have purchased the satires in the subscription edition. To please the purchasers of the fine-paper issues, the printer was instructed to disguise Y122 and Y125, setting them to resemble Y124 and Y127 as closely as possible, which allowed buyers to assume they owned the first edition. These wealthier readers would have desired the editio princeps either because they were vain book collectors or because they distrusted the accuracy of second editions. Not surprisingly, copies of the second editions were used when Tonson's copyright was registered. Copies of the first edition of Satire I, and perhaps II, were already spoken for, and, if Tonson had acquired an interest in the folio sale, he would have wished to deposit copies at least partly his. But it is also possible that the second-edition copies were deposited as part of the ruse of passing off those editions as first editions. We do not know, however, whether it was Young or Tonson who commissioned the second editions with fine-paper issues. The copyright agreement might not have given Tonson any interest in the folio sale. 11 We can argue Tonson's interest in the folios is reflected by the printing of the more costly fine-paper issue in a larger edition. Also, the Tonson house was more likely to sell to "fine-paper" customers than the trade-publisher Roberts. Furthermore, the only signed presentation copy of Satires I and II that Foxon has recorded (I, 919, Y124) is from Y124; it along with a copy of the first edition of Satire II and others of Satires III and IV was given to George Clarke and dated 8 February 1725[/26]. We could argue that Young did not give Clark a copy of the fine-paper edition because it belonged to Tonson, although he may well have preferred to give away only copies of the first editions. Conversely, we can argue from the absence of the Tonson name in advertisements of the satires that Young himself paid for them and alone received profits from their sales. 12 Finally, we can argue from penned corrections on all copies of Satire VI that Young, not the wealthy and more powerful Tonson, was paying the printer. 13 In any case, the decision to sell folios to the affluent, originally targeted as subscribers to a postponed edition, would explain why the editions were hidden and why the fine-paper issues would not be from the first edition. We know from damaged type that the edition of Satire II without a fine-paper issue (Y124) is not the first. If it was decided after the first edition of Satire II to bring out a fine-paper issue, then surely it was decided to do the same for Satire I after it had been published. If we suppose, as Foxon has, that Satire I was first published in an edition with fine-paper issue, why was the same not done for Satire II? Furthermore, would not the precariousness of publishing a poem have discouraged the impecunious Young from printing his first edition with an expensive fine-paper issue? Although my clarification of priority within these hidden editions only affects two accidental readings in each satire, it may offer useful information to scholars studying the book trade, particularly the demands of readers, the marketing of fine-paper issues, and the inter-relations of author, tradepublisher, and copyright holder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Additional information concerning these editions and their publications can be obtained from my dissertation, "A Critical Reader's Edition of Edward Young's Satiric Poetry: Love of Fame and Two Epistles to Mr. Pope " (Diss. Maryland, 1981). 2 David Foxon records that James Roberts entered in the Stationers' Register to Jacob Tonson Satires I and II on 9 April 1725, III on 7 May, IV on 18 June, and The Last on 21 January 1726 ( English Verse 1700-1750: A Catalogue of Separately Printed Poems with Notes on Contemporary Collected Editions [1975], I, 919, Y122-Y132). Foxon also records the location of deposit copies and the editions to which they belong. The role of James Roberts (active 1706-54), printer and publisher, in the sale of the satires is not clear. Young refers to Tonson as his bookseller in Satire The Last: "I hasten to compleat / My own design; for Tonson 's at the Gate" (ll. 115-16). Charles E. Frank pointed out that Roberts' advertisements for the period never included mention of The Universal Passion , nor did advertisements for Young's satires mention other works printed for Roberts ("Edward Young's Satires: Materials for an Edition of Love of Fame " [Diss. Princeton, 1939], p. 52). However, Roberts' shop did sell the satires, as is evident in the Monthly Catalogue of April 1725's announcement that Satires II and III were " Sold by J. Roberts in Warwick-Lane " (II, 24, 6) and of February 1727's that Satire V was also sold at Roberts' address (III, 46, 18). The manner in which the satires were advertised suggests that Young took responsibility for the sale and that Roberts' financial returns were limited to the distribution fees of a trade publisher, although Young may also have paid Roberts to print the satires. For information on Roberts' pre-eminence as the owner of "the largest trade publishing shop in London" and on his duties and pecuniary reward as a publisher for copyright holders, see Michael Treadwell's "London Trade Publishers 1675-1750," The Library , 6th Ser., 4 (1982), 110ff. 3 The earliest known advertisement of Satire I occurred in the Post-Boy of 21-23 January 1725 (#5541), as Frank first noted (p. 155), and of Satire II in the Daily Courant of 2 April 1725, as Foxon has noted (I, 919, Y125). 4 Foxon, I, 919. I have compared copies of Y122 at the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Houghton Library at Harvard, Library of Congress (AC/901/.M5), Michigan State University, Princeton (2: Ex 3999.7.392q and, fine-paper Y123, Ex 3598.999q v.48), University of Indiana, University of Texas (Wk Y858 -B725u), and Yale (2: Folio Pamphlets 16 and Ik Y85 +725); of Y124 at the William A. Clark Library, Duke University, the Huntington Library, Library of Congress (PR/3782/.U5/1725), and University of Iowa; of Y125 at Cornell, Folger Shakespeare Library, the Houghton Library, Library Company of Philadelphia, Princeton (Ex 3598.999q v.48), Michigan State University, University of Indiana, University of Texas (2: Ak Y858 -725v and Wk Y858 -B726u) and Yale (IK Y85 +725); of Y127 at the William A. Clark, Duke University, Library of Congress (PR/3782/.U5/1725), Princeton (Ex 3999.7.392q), and University of Iowa. Photocopies of forme B i from copies of Y125 (unbound) and Y127 (bound) at the Bath Reference Library have also been examined. 5 Foxon lists the fine-paper issue of Satire I as Y123, of which there is a copy at Princeton (Ex 3598.999q v.48), and that of Satire II as Y126, of which there is a copy at the Newberry Library (for the examination of which I am grateful to Librarian Anne Zald). 6 The Y122 edition of Satire I has the press figure 4 on p. 2, 4 on p. 8, 2 on p. 14; whereas, Y124 has the figure 4 on p. 11. There are two accidental variants between these editions: Y124 incorrectly reads 'Wig' and Y122 reads 'Whig' at line 57 (p. 4, l. 7); and Y124 reads 'shou'd' and Y122 'shoud' at line 103 (p. 6, l. 11). The Y125 edition of Satire II has the press figure 4 on p. 14; whereas, the Y127 has no press figures. The two accidental variants between these editions are: Y125 reads 'shown;' and Y127 reads 'shown?' at line 86 (p. 7, l. 14); and Y125 reads 'look,' and Y127 reads 'look∧' (without a comma) at line 184 (p. 12, l. 6). 7 Copies of Y124 and Y127 are bound together at the British Library (643.1.25/20), Worcester College, the Brotherton Collection of the University of Leeds, the Bath Reference Library, the William A. Clark Library, the Library of Congress, Duke University, and the University of Iowa. In some cases, these copies have long been bound together, as the presentation copies at Worcester College or those in the Brotherton Library, of which Librarian C. D. W. Sheppard has written to me: "The evidence of corresponding stab marks, of surviving speckled edges to pages and, to some extent, of other marks suggests that all the first five items [satires] were previously bound together, probably in the eighteenth century" (they were rebound in the twentieth century). 8 Young was trying at this time to become a chaplain to Lord Carteret, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In writing his friend Tickell, then in Ireland, Young wanted to reassure Carteret that he sincerely intended to be ordained at the first future ordination, but he admitted to Tickell, "I had thoughts of defering Orders till the spring, on Account of Affairs I was to make up with D[uke of]. Wharton, &amp; a subscription wh I thought wd run better, before I was entered into another way" ( The Correspondence of Edward Young 1683-1765 , ed. Henry Pettit [1971], p. 30). 9 Frank, pp. 32-34; Trevor Mills, "An Unpublished Subscription Edition of Edward Young's Works," Library , 6th Ser., 2 (1980), 460-465. In 1726, at least a year after the appearance of Satire I, William Wilkins printed Young's A Paraphrase on a Part of the Book of Job , with the first leaf, A1, containing the advertisement "A Specimen for Subscribers." The verso proposed that "this Author's WORKS, in PROSE, and VERSE, the greatest Part of which are yet unpublish'd, shall be printed in Three Quarto Volumes." Later, about the time Satire V was published, as Pettit first noted ( Correspondence , p. 49), the subscription was advertised on 18, 20, and 21 February 1927 in the Daily Journal , Daily Courant , and Daily Post . Frank did not know of these later advertisements and assumed that The Universal Passion was an "abortive" subscription (p. 33). 10 In roughly twenty letters, written from 3 August 1724 to 14 April 1728, Young solicited Tickell's help in his efforts to achieve a temporary and not very remunerative chaplaincy from Carteret (see Correspondence , pp. 26-65). 11 The copyright agreement may have given Young sole rights and profits to the satires until after he deemed the poem complete or until a set time, like March 1728. Such agreements did exist as can be seen from James Thomson's sale to John Millan of the rights to Winter on 18 July 1729. Winter was published earlier on 29 April 1726 and entered by Roberts to Millan at that time. Presumably they had an agreement, and the entry to Millan, besides indicating his future rights, prevented other members of the Stationers' Company from printing the poem. The deed of sale is recorded by Alan D. McKillop in James Thomson (1706-1748): Letters and Documents (1958), pp. 63-64. William Sale, Jr., has also noted that, although John Millan and Andrew Millar owned copyrights to the poems in Thomson's subscription edition of the Seasons (1730), the profits from that edition went to Thomson ( Samuel Richardson: Master Printer [1950], p. 210). 12 Advertisements for the satires never refer to other works or to their sale anywhere but at Roberts' shop; these notices are identified in the description of editions to my "Critical, Reader's Edition," pp. 449ff. 13 All copies of Satire VI (Foxon's Y135-136) contain handwritten corrections. On p. 28, ll. 1-2 were inked out, and on p. 30, l. 13, the word ' phrase ' was crossed out and ' Farce ' (sometimes ' farce ') was written above it. Curiously, this is the only folio containing errata, on p. 20, which correct four errors lying on or between pp. 4 and 24. Yet Satire III (Foxon's Y128) required such: in most copies, on p. 14, l. 16, in the same ink and by the same hand, the number '2' has been placed above the word 'smile' and '1' above the word 'curse' to indicate that these words should be transposed.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Authority of Accidental Variants in the Tonson Second Edition of Edward Young's Love of Fame by James E. May</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In preparing an edition of Edward Young's Love of Fame , I have encountered evidence that the author revised punctuation, capitalization, and italics throughout the 2534 lines of the satires for the Tonson octavo of 1728. These seven satires were first printed separately in folios entitled The Universal Passion from January 1725 to February 1728. They bear the imprint "Printed for J. ROBERTS in Warwick-Lane ," yet the first five were entered in the Stationers' Company's Register to Jacob Tonson. 1 A month after the last was published, they were printed in octavo "for J. TONSON" (O1). Numerous ornaments shared between F1 and O1 suggest that the same printshop composed both editions. 2 The title of O1 designates it "The SECOND EDITION Corrected, and Alter'd." Substantive changes in the text confirm Young's involvement: four lines moved, twenty-four lines removed, twelve lines and a preface added, and thirty changes in word and phrase, most of which are Young's. In addition to these changes, there is abnormal, indeed enormous, change in punctuation, decrease in capitals, and increase in italics. O1 has important textual consequences, for, with very few exceptions, 3 all subsequent editions of the satires derive from it. Rarely, at least for this period, has anyone made a strong case for an author's revision of accidentals in a revised reprint without considerably more substantive revision, which makes this hypothesis that Young did so suspicious but also significant. In his 1939 dissertation, Charles E. Frank first observed the relevance of the italic changes to editors of the satires. Although he did not collate the satires nor observe the changes in punctuation and capitals, he accepted the italics changes as Young's on the basis of their propriety. 4 In 1958 Bertrand Bronson offered the opinion that not only the italics but the capitalization changes were Young's: "Neither Tonson nor his printer can be accountable for the intimate appeal to the reader: only the author himself could be so officious." 5 This essay will offer textual evidence to substantiate these claims and to demarcate precisely which accidentals Young revised. Since there is no external evidence about Young's revisions of F, the evidence that he revised his accidentals must come from the editions. The main reason for supposing Young revised accidentals involves the extensive and selective nature of the variants. As evidence that these changes far exceed the norm, we may compare them in number with the variants of the second and third Tonson octavos, published in 1730 and 1741 (O2, O3). 6 In O2's reprinting of O1, we find 3 changes to lower case, 14 to upper case, 29 in punctuation, 30 in spelling, 2 to roman font, and none to italic. In O3's reprinting of O2, we find added 6 changes to lower case, 8 to upper case, 15 in punctuation, 21 in spelling, 5 to roman font, and 1 to italic. The average of these variants for both reprintings is 4.5 changes to lower case, 11 to upper case, 22 in punctuation, 25.5 in spelling, 3.5 to roman font, and 0.5 to italic. In O1, by contrast, there are 152 changes involving 175 marks in punctuation, 667 to lower case, and 920 to italics. Moreover, there are qualitative differences in the two sets of variants. In O2 and O3 there is noticeably more movement to roman font and to upper case than to italic and to lower case; whereas, the reverse occurs in O1. O2 and O3's increase in upper case is typical of most reprints of the satires; for example, in the 1741 Works , published by Curll et al. , which reprints O2, we find ten changes to upper case for every one to lower. Finally, in O2 and O3 there are far more compositorial errors in punctuation and spelling than in italics. At times accidental changes can be assigned with probability to the author because they are found in great numbers near substantive changes that are clearly authorial. Unfortunately, there is no evidence in any of the twenty-two formes of O1 with poetic text that Young introduced the accidental changes while making substantive changes in the proofs. Inner and outer formes for the same gatherings have proportional numbers of changes. 7 Also, there are so many accidental changes that their introduction after the proof-stage would have required expensive recomposing. Apparently, Young introduced his emendations in a copy of F. My count, however, shows that often more accidental variants fall on F pages without substantive changes than on those with them. Within each satire, accidentals changed in O1 occur evenly throughout the pages of F, as can be seen from the following figures: per page with sub. var. without sub. var. Satire I 12.5 14.0 II 8.2 9.0 III 7.7 8.3 IV 8.6 10.7 V 8.0 6.9 VI 2.5 2.8 VII 10.0 8.5 Although these figures refer to the average number of lines with changes, not to specific changes, they show that only in Satire The Last (VII) is there any suggestion that Young spot-corrected accidentals in the vicinity of substantive changes, and they offer no help in determining which changes are Young's. Since in O1 an extraordinary number of accidental changes are spread throughout, with equally distributed substantive changes, Young probably revised his accidentals. The question of exactly which changes in O1 are his remains, however. Professor Bowers has sketched a method for referring certain accidentals in the revised Folio edition of Jonson's Sejanus to the author. This method mimics the more commonly discussed process for assigning substantive changes to an author: identifying homogeneous classes of changes by consensus. 8 This argument from consistency of change is not so strong in O1 with accidentals as it is with substantives since each compositor behaves more systematically with accidentals than he does with substantives. The argument can be strengthened by considering whether these changes are typical of compositorial handiwork in unrevised editions. For instance, consistent movements to italics in O1 are likely to be authorial because, as a rule, unrevised reprints lose italic type. Also, a study of the author's holographs can be used to throw out certain spelling and punctuation changes as non-authorial. Thus, I attributed to the compositor consistent correction to readings at odds with Young's practice in his letters, as the introduction of apostrophes and the regularization of 'y' and 'ys' to 'i' and 'ies'. But there are three classes of consistent accidental changes that I accept as Young's: the introduction of commas for parentheses and compounds, of lower-case letters, and of italics for emphasizing common names. There are 152 changes in syntactic punctuation, involving 175 marks, figures which do not include hyphens and apostrophes, which are more of the order of orthographic changes. The Tonsons' other octavos introduced so few punctuation changes that many of the 152 are probably authorial. This is perhaps also suggested by a rather high incidence of punctuation changes on pages with substantive changes. Of 29 pages with substantive change, 7 lack any punctuation change; whereas, of 129 pages of poetic text, 52 lack punctuation change. This means that only 24% of the pages with substantive alteration lack punctuation variants, but 40% of the total do. Young's involvement is further suggested by the fact that Satire VI, with almost one-quarter of the lines in the collected satires, has but seven punctuation changes, only one of which belongs to either class accepted as authorial. 9 Most likely, Young revised it apart from the other satires. The sudden decrease of punctuation variants in O1 when Satire VI begins does not correspond to a change in the formes set by compositors since it begins on I4. And, were the alterations primarily compositorial, we would expect them to occur more proportionately throughout the satires. Only two classes of punctuation changes appear to be authorial: both involve commas primarily within the line. Given the great critical concern for the caesura, which is largely emphasized by punctuation, it seems likely that compositors would be careful to preserve it, certainly more so than with external punctuation. Furthermore, at the line-end, where independent clauses commonly conclude, five different punctuation marks may be appropriate and have little effect upon the reading. But internally nothing may be appropriate but a comma, as for parenthesizing a prepositional phrase. In general, punctuation changes at the line-end have almost no effect on rhythm or speech accent, for they usually entail the replacement of one mark for another, and the sense and syntax close off at least half the lines. But changes in internal punctuation do not usually involve replacement but the introduction and removal of commas, and they have a rhetorical effect. Thus, it stands to reason, and some evidence can be found to support the generalization, 10 that compositors were more faithful to the internal than to the external punctuation of their copy. The two classes of internal punctuation that I find authorial are the introduction of a comma after the first word or phrase of a compound and the introduction or completion of parenthetic commas. The commas inserted in compounds involve marks like that after ' vice ' in the line "All friends to vice, and folly are thy foes" (II.6). Not surprisingly, aside from within the first foot, these commas usually appear between feet. The comma-pause within compounds seems to be an idiosyncracy of Young's, occurring often in F and also in his Two Epistles to Mr. Pope (1730) and his correspondence; this pointing is frequently deleted in later reprints. The parenthetic commas are introduced around prepositional phrases, appositives, and adverbial and adjectival clauses. For instance, in F the line "And to this cost another must succeed" (II.89) lacks any pause; but in O1 commas were introduced after 'And' and 'cost' to create a word accent which slightly counterpoints the regular verse accent. There are some comma insertions that create pauses before surprising and antithetical words, which I have not accepted since they are not truly parenthetic. Although these offer similarly useful guidance to the reader, they are not abundant enough to treat as a class. 11 Six of the parenthetic changes involve marks at the line endings; however, in five of these cases, the external comma is introduced with an internal one. 12 Totalled, there are 49 parenthetic changes involving 72 marks, and 30 compound changes. The high incidence of these changes, 79 of 152 punctuation variants, with other internal marks being negligible, further argues their authority. That Young expanded his use of italics for emphasizing common names is not so surprising as it may seem. Since verse satire closely approximates colloquial, dramatic speech, poets and printers recognized that it needed more italics than other kinds of publications. 13 To facilitate the reader's recreation of the satirist's voice, poets italicized many expressions that were to receive special speech accents. Even in F Young had, for logical and rhetorical reasons, italicized 567 common names. Italics also place stress on words that the eighteenth-century reader, indisposed to perceive trochees and pyrrhics, would not normally stress. 14 More significantly, italics frequently influence the sense of the lines, often giving words a more pointed signification. For example, in Satire II's ridicule of Codrus' pretensions to learning through a library he never reads, Young wrote: Editions various, at high prices bought, Inform the world what Codrus would be thought ; And, to this cost, another must succeed, To pay a Sage, who says that he can read. (ll. 87-90) Were ' says ' not italicized, the reader would probably not understand the sage also to be uneducated. Thus, the italics increase the irony and sarcasm, adding another satiric victim. When, as in Love of Fame , an ironic perspective, or tone, has been established, the reader will tend to read any italicized words as ironic or even unreliable, as can be seen in the following italics introduced in O1. Young mimicks those overly confident of the Lord's mercy: "Will the great author us poor worms destroy, / For now and then a sip of transient joy?" (VI.441-442). If 'now and then' or 'joy' were italicized instead of ' sip ', the irony, and with it the meaning of the sentence, would shift considerably, directing our attention to a different self-deceit. There is a growing body of evidence that poets of Young's day cared for their accidentals and that, in particular, they underlined their manuscripts to determine italics and later revised accordingly. Pope's holographs of "An Essay on Pastorals," Epistle to Bathurst , and Essay on Criticism all contain underlining to indicate italics, and the underlining in the last, which served as printer's copy for the first edition, determines almost all the italicized words in the printed text. 15 There are two poetic holographs reprinted in Young's correspondence, both of which contain underlining, showing that he too wished to determine what common names would receive rhetorical emphasis. 16 The italics changes in the revised editions of Thomson's poems, in particular his Winter , cannot be explained with references to the habits of compositors. 17 Matthew Prior complained in his letters of spending months over the "commas, semicolons, italics, and capitals" of his Poems on Several Occasions (1718), 18 which Monroe K. Spears and H. Bunker Wright accordingly chose as copy-text for poems previously printed. Although the empirical evidence presented here is not that extensive, it does refer to the practice of Young's peers in poetry. Moreover, common sense suggests that a compositor was not likely to introduce italics in a reprint, for, being paid by piece-work, 19 he would unnecessarily lessen his wages if he tried to determine what else to italicize and his eye would not likely mistake roman type in a roman text for italic. The main reason some scholars had assumed that compositors determined capitals and italics involves their frequent variation in editions of the same poem in different formats. 20 But David Foxon and Phyllis Guskin have recently argued that authors used more italics in texts directed at vulgar audiences, which would explain much of whatever increase in italics does occur in smaller formats. In his Lyell lectures at Oxford in 1976, Foxon showed how Pope altered his use of accidentals for emphasis in different editions of his Homer and his Essay on Criticism . 21 Similarly, Guskin has found that in the Drapier's Letters , Swift's "use of italics for emphasis was related both to the level of the audience and the complexity or subtlety of meaning to be communicated." 22 Thus, Young may have wanted more italic emphasis in the octavo edition because he distrusted its readers' ability to preceive his wit and irony. Of the particular arguments for the authority of the italics introduced in O1, the foremost is their extraordinary frequency: 920 common names are italicized. None of the twenty-one reprintings before 1765 which descend from O1 introduces more than a dozen. A related argument for the italics' authority involves their permanence once introduced. Consider the italic variants found in the duodecimo Works of 1765, five reprintings away from O1. 23 A collation of this 1765 edition with O1 discovers that, after the text has passed through five different houses, twenty-six words have been erroneously placed in roman but only four in italic type. With the exception of two editions in 1750 and two others that descend from them, which eschew italics altogether, 24 italic and roman type of O1 was preserved but for occasional slips far more often to roman than to italic. One of the strongest arguments for the authority of these new italics derives from their progressive increase in the folios and O1. A new heavily italicized style does not suddenly appear in 1728, a fact which reduces the possibility that Young or the house hired someone to make alterations for O1. The first five satires published, I—IV and The Last, were written and conceived earlier than V and VI and were published from January 1725 to January 1726. In these satires, where an average of 41 words per satire (excluding proper names) are italicized, italic type is used sparingly for emphasis. But in Satire V, published in February 1727, and in VI, published in February 1728, italics for accentuation substantially increase. We find 204 words italicized in Satire V and 156 in VI. These are longer poems, but, if we reduce these figures in proportion to the 290 lines of Satire I, we would still have 103 and 74 italicized common names for Satires V and VI. Consequently, a month after the folio of Satire VI was published, when the satires were reprinted in O1, italics increased dramatically only in the first five satires published: there are 120 changes to italics in Satire I, 132 in II, 136 in III, 187 in IV, 79 in The Last, 196 in V, and 70 in VI. One way of dramatizing this change is to note that in the folio of The Last there is one word in italics for every eight lines, in the folio of V there is one for every three lines, and in O1 as a whole there is one for every one-and-a-half lines. A related fact—which supports the hypothesis that Young himself added the italics—is that the new and revised substantives of O1 are often italicized and lines added all contain italics for emphasis. 25 As Bronson perceived, 26 and as the statistics in Table I indicate, this is a complex change involving an increase in italics along with a concomitant decrease in capitals. In Satire IV of O1, 66 words were revised to lower case and 187 to italic in its 260 lines, but, in Satire V of O1, only 89 words were revised to lower case and 196 to italic in almost twice as many lines. Also, Table I The following table indicates the changes in capitals and italics in O1. Column one indicates the number of lines shared by F and O1. Columns two and three list respectively the total number of italicized common names in F and of common names first italicized in O1. Column four lists the number of common names capitalized for emphasis in the first 200 lines of F. Columns five and six list respectively the number of capitalized common names in F revised in O1 to lower case and of capitalized common names in roman type revised in O1 to lower case italics. 1 2 3 4 5 6 I, 286 55 120 331 248 117 II, 290 47 132 121 80 74 III, 284 58 136 47 33 29 IV, 260 16 187 105 66 65 Last, 234 31 79 145 150 66 V, 574 204 196 127 89 49 VI, 606 156 70 36 1 1 --- --- --- --- Total: 567 920 667 401 lines shared ital. words in F newly ital. words in O1 u.c. in ll. 1-200 of F words changed to l. c. in O1 u.c. roman words changed to l.c. italics in O1 the folio with the least indiscriminate and emphatic capitalization, Satire III, with only 47 words capitalized in its first 200 lines, received far fewer changes to lower case, 33, than did that with the most capitalization, Satire I, with 331 words capitalized in its first 200 lines, which received 248 changes to lower case. Thus, many figures that stand out as exceptions to the progressive replacement of capitals with italics reflect the inconsistent capitalization for emphasis in F. Only when F is revised, did the satires receive a coherent accidental style. The authority of O1's 667 revisions to lower case is best considered within the context of these italics changes. In Young's poems before the satires, as in Pope's early poetry, nearly all substantives are capitalized. The folio of Satire I has that older style of capitalization, although it has been modified such that important verbs and adjectives are capitalized and less important substantives, especially in lines with several capitalized words, are in lower case. In all the later satires, capitalization is largely emphatic and most substantives are not capitalized. Although the more abstract and panegyrical Satire The Last breaks the pattern, we can see from the figures in column 4 of the table that Young progressively capitalized fewer common names. Capitalized substantives are especially rare in F's Satire VI, less than two for every dozen lines. Thus, O1's great decrease in capitalization, like the increase in italics, is part of a stylistic evolution and does not suggest the sudden interruption of a compositor or corrector. If the italics changes are Young's—and the evidence strongly argues that they are—then why not suppose that Young also felt the need to revise his capitals? When Young introduced italics for emphasis, he would have reviewed all the emphatic devices and seen that he needed to decrease the capitals to prevent the text from being overloaded with accentual devices. Accordingly, we find that 401 of the changes to lower case also involve changes to italics. Virtually all the capitalized verbs and most of the capitalized adjectives were placed in lower-case italics. Also, almost all the capitalized common nouns in italics were changed to lower case. The fact that so many words simultaneously change case and font increases the probability that Young made both changes. The inter-relation of the italics and capitalization changes is evident in Satire I where 117 of the 120 newly italicized words are also changed to lower case or in Satire IV where 65 of the 66 words changed to lower case are also italicized. Although previously lower case words are italicized and some capitalized words are placed in lower-case roman, Young's intention seems to have been to make italics the primary emphatis device in O1; whereas, capitals had been such in F. 27 The authority of the lower-case changes in O1 can be further argued on other grounds. Since he had abandoned the old style of capitalizing substantives after Satire I of F, Young probably would have changed to lower case the 131 capitalized words of that satire which are placed in lower case but not italicized. If we substract these changes and the 401 involving substitution of lower-case italics for upper-case roman from the total number of changes to lower case (667), we still have 135 changes. This figure is itself unusually high when compared to the 4.5 average changes in the other Tonson octavos. Also, the reduction to lower case of a single word and the raising to upper case of only three words in O1's reprinting of Satire VI argues strongly that the compositor was not regularizing capitalization. Parenthetically, putting aside the question of authority, an editor could accept the changes to lower case on the basis of Greg's belief that an edition should reflect the accidentals of its author's day. 28 To accept the italics of O1 while keeping the prolix capitals of F would produce a bastard accidental style that no compositor ever did or would impose. In summary, I would accept as authorial the italics changes in the revised O1 edition of Love of Fame for a variety of reasons: the general interest in accidentals among major poets and the willingness of compositors to respect their intentions, Young's underlining in his holographs to determine italics for emphasis, the extraordinary increase in italics within O1, the permanence of these italics once introduced, and their progressive increase throughout F and O1. Although a few of the italics changes might well be compositorial, it would be, to borrow a phrase from Greg, "injudicious to make the attempt" to separate these variants from Young's revisions. 29 The same caveat applies to the changes to lower case and in internal comma pointing that have also been attributed to Young.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Full bibliographical descriptions of the editions referred to in this essay are available in my "Critical, Reader's Edition of Edward Young's Satiric Poetry: Love of Fame and Two Epistles to Mr. Pope " (Diss. Maryland, 1981), as is publication information, although much of the latter is more conveniently found in David Foxon's English Verse 1700-1750 (1975), I, 919-920. Collations of at least six copies of each of the folios and of the Tonson octavo of 1728 form the inductive basis of this study. 2 For instance, the ornament of a flower-basket flanked by perched birds (77 x 36.5 mm.) on the title pages of F's Satires I, II, and V occurs as the tail-piece to Satire III in O1. 3 The only editions subsequent to O1 but not derived from it are eclectic editions of Satires V and The Last, printed by Stephen Powell for George Ewing, Dublin, 1728, and of Satire I, also printed by Powell for Ewing, in 1731 (all three of which impose substantive changes from O1 upon F's accidentals), and the first satire of the Foulis edition of 1758, which descends from Powell's 1731 edition. 4 Charles E. Frank, "Edward Young's Satires: Materials for an Edition of Love of Fame (Diss. Princeton, 1939), pp. 42-43. 5 Bertrand Bronson, Printing as an Index of Taste in Eighteenth-Century England (1958), p. 16. This argument on the propriety of italics to sense, on which both Frank and Bronson entirely rely, perhaps underestimates the abilities of the premier printers that poets like Young engaged for important editions. 6 Foxon's English Verse 1700-1750 lists the 1730 and 1741 octavos as Y171 and Y173 (I, 921-922). These editions share many ornaments with O1; for instance, the heron headpiece of O1's Satire III recurs in O2's Satire I and O3's Preface and Satire II. 7 The following are the number of lines with accidental variants in each forme of O1 (formes G o [outer], H i [inner], and M o lack substantive variants): B i , 57; B o , 77; C i , 46; C o , 58; D i , 51; D o , 39; E i , 41; E o , 42; F i , 66; F o , 59; G i , 45; G o , 44; H i , 38; H o , 29; I i , 18; I o , 22; K i , 27; K o , 20; L i , 8; L o , 7; M i , 61; M o , 52. These 907 lines with accidental changes are distributed, with the exception of Satire VI, fairly evenly throughout the seven satires. About one-third to one-half of the lines in the other six satires are altered, as can be seen by comparing the total number of lines changed with the number of lines shared by F and O1 for each satire: Satire I has 171 of 286 lines altered, II has 112 of 290, III has 107 of 284, IV has 137 of 260, V has 189 of 574, VI has 65 of 606, and The Last has 116 of 234. 8 "Greg's 'Rationale of Copy-Text' Revisited," Studies in Bibliography , 31 (1978), 114-116. 9 The only accepted punctuation variant in O1's Satire VI is a parenthetic comma after 'uncontroul'd' in the lines: "By wealth unquench'd, by reason uncontroul'd, / For ever burns her sacred thirst of gold" (VI.289-290). Since Young did not make systematic comma changes, nor case changes, in Satire VI, it might be best accepted as an editorial emendation. However, four words italicized in lines 282 and 293 of O1 argue that he may well have introduced it. 10 A glance over the apparatus of the California Dryden shows that unauthorized reprints add a dozen end-line punctuation variants for each change within the line. In The Medal , for instance, where there are over half as many lines with internal marks as there are with external, several unrevised reprints introduced but four changes of syntactical punctuation within the 322-line text and over sixty changes at the line endings. ( The Works of John Dryden , eds. H. T. Swedenberg, Jr., and Vinton Dearing [1972], II, 427-428). Also, the great majority of punctuation changes in O2 and O3 occur at the line ends. 11 For instance, a comma is inserted in O1 between the following verb and its infinitive of reason, as if to underline an implicit antithesis: "why will you starve , to be admired ?" (IV.186). 12 The five parenthetic commas at the line ends that are inserted as part of a set occur at I.86, I.234-235, IV.181, VI.31-32, and V.173-74. The sixth, introduced singly, occurs at VI.289 and is discussed in footnote 9. 13 For instance, the printer Philip Luckombe wrote that italic type should "be used for such purposes as it was designed for; viz. . . . for words, terms, or expressions . . . by which they [authors] intend to convey to the reader either instructing, satyriżing , admiring, or other hints and remarks" (my italics; A Concise History of the Origin and Progress of Printing [1770], p. 235). The satirists of the period make frequent use of italics. James Bramston italicized 100 common names in the first 243 lines of The Art of Politics (1729) and James Miller italicized 328 in the first 400 lines of his Harlequin-Horace (1731). Bramston's use of italics is proportional to Young's in Two Epistles to Mr. Pope , where 195 common names are italicized in 628 lines, and Miller's use is proportional to Young's in Love of Fame (O1), where two words are italicized for every three lines. Irony, so prevalent in satire and troublesome to many eighteenth-century readers, seems to have particularly required italics. Jacob Viner has noted that Edward Capell, in the Preface to Prolusions; or, Select Pieces of Antient Poetry (1760), urged that dots be placed above ironic passages for greater clarity, arguing, "there seem'd to be much want of a particular note of punctuation to distinguish irony, which is often so delicately couch'd as to escape the notice of even the attentive reader" ( The Augustan Milieu , ed. H. K. Miller et al. [1970], p. 81). 14 Consider the effect of italics in the following lines: That makes the Banquet poignant, and polite (VI.44) And the last word is her eternal right. (V.82) In the first case a trochaic and the second a pyrrhic foot are created by stressing the emphatic words, but, as Paul Fussell has noted, the elocutionary art of the day preferred to impose stress regularity even to the neglect of the sense. After quoting Richard Bentley's placement of a stress over 'with' in Milton's line "Thus Belial with words clothed in Reason's garb," Fussell remarked: "A scholar like Bentley, one of the most learned men of his time, in his anxiety to behold evidence of temporal regularity where it does not necessarily exist, is here to be seen paying almost no attention to the meaning of Milton's lines, and laying a strong stress on a word which almost never takes it in English" ( Theory of Prosody in Eighteenth-Century England [1966], p. 19). 15 Maynard Mack reprints "An Essay on Pastoral" in "Pope's Pastoral," The Scriblerian and the Kit-Cats , 12 (1980), 85-161; see p. 102 where the word 'Italic' is written in the margin next to underlined words. See also Earl H. Wasserman's Pope's 'Epistle to Bathurst': A Critical Reading with an Edition of the Manuscript (1960), pp. 76-77, and Robert M. Schmitz's Pope's 'Essay on Criticism' 1709: A Study of the Bodleian Manuscript Text with Facsimiles, Transcripts, and Variants (1962). 16 One poem is a dedication of the satires to the Duke of Chandos, and the other, reprinted from the Monthly Magazine of 1 April 1816, is Young's revision of The Foreign Address ; see The Correspondence of Edward Young , ed. Henry Pettit (1971), pp. 59-60 and 426-428. Accentual italics are rare but do occur in other poetic holographs reprinted by Pettit on pp. 16-17, 140 and 154. 17 In N. Blandford's second-edition reprinting (O1) of the Roberts folio (F) of Winter , there are both italic and substantive changes. While the second-edition O1 preserves all the italics of F, it places ten old words and introduces 32 new words in italics. Then, in O5 (1728), also by Blandford, new lines are added and 73 words italicized in F and O1 are romanized. When O5 is reprinted with lines added in the subscription quarto (Q1) and an octavo (O6) in 1730, none of O5's words are newly italicized or romanized. If we attribute the increase in italics in O1 and, paradoxically, their decrease in O5 to Blandford's compositor, how can we explain the identical use of italics in lines shared by O5, O6, and Q1? 18 Historical Manuscripts Commission, Calender of the Manuscripts of the Marquis of Bath , III (1908), 454; on Prior's care for his accidentals, see also pp. 455 and 459-460. On Spears and Wright's choice of copy-text, see The Literary Works of Matthew Prior (1959), I, xlviii-xlix; and Wright's "Ideal Copy and Authoritative Text: The Problem of Prior's Poems on Several Occasions (1718)," Modern Philology , 49 (1952), 234-235. 19 On the piece-work wages of compositors during the handpress period, see Philip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972), pp. 54-55 and 172-173. 20 Both the old orthodoxy and the emerging position are reflected in Bronson's remark, "I have seen no evidence to support Geoffrey Tillotson's hypothesis that in the time of Pope capitalization was even loosely—still less 'rigorously'—dependent upon format" ( Printing as an Index of Taste , p. 17). That the increase of italics in O1 is not due to format convention can be seen from the fidelity of Dublin and Edinburgh octavo reprintings of F. In the first Edinburgh editions of Satires I-IV and The Last (Foxon's Y138, Y140, Y142, Y144, and Y146 [ English Verse 1700-1750 , I, 920]), there are but seven words changed to roman and none to italic. No italics are introduced in the many Dublin editions from 1725-27 (Foxon's Y149-54, Y156-58, Y160-61, Y163, and Y165). 21 In reviewing these lectures, Nicolas Barker remarked that "It is fascinating to discover Pope using the 'simpler' mode [that with less typographical emphasis] for the Homer subscribers' text (who were assumed to be cognoscenti ) while using a fuller range for the popular editions; evidently Pope felt the vulgar needed such help to grasp every nuance" of his text ("Pope and his Publishers," TLS , 3 September 1976, p. 1085). See also Foxon's suggestion that Pope's revision of accidentals for revised reprints may have been a practice so common among poets that "In cases like those of Cowley and Crabbe, where second editions add stress either by capitalizing selected nouns or by the use of italic," the "changes should be considered authorial unless proved otherwise" (Greg's 'Rationale' and the Editing of Pope," The Library , 5th ser., 33 [1978], 123). 22 Phyllis J. Guskin, "Intentional Accidentals: Typography and Audience in Swift's Drapier's Letters ," Eighteenth-Century Life , VI, NS 1 (October, 1980), 81. Guskin does not study revised editions but notes that works intended for different audiences were issued with different degrees of italicization. 23 The Works of the Reverend Edward Young, LL.D. , 4 vols. (1765); the accidental texture of this edition derives from O1 through O2 (Tonson, 1730), Works 1741 (Curll, et al. ), Works 1752 (a duodecimo "London"), and Robert Urie's duodecimo, issued in a Works and singly (Glasgow, 1755). 24 An octavo printed by Robert and Andrew Foulis (Glasgow, 1750) and an octavo "Printed for J. WATTS," probably a Scottish piracy ("London," 1750), have no italic type in the Preface or the satires. An octavo of 1753 (n.p.), which follows the Foulis' readings, and an octavo printed for J. James (London, 1762), which follows Watts', necessarily lack O1's italic, nor do they introduce any on their own initiative. 25 In O1 new words in italics are substituted for old words in roman at I.251, II.140, II.144, III.143, III.163, IV.110, V.126, V.404 (two new words italicized for two old), VI.531, VII.148, and VII.237. Italicized words also occur in new lines added: IV.65-66, IV.247-248, VI.389-390, VI.393-394, and VII.155-158. 26 Bronson wrote that in O1 Young "avoids unnecessary capitals but, to even matters, indulges in a rhetorically rib-nudging, eyebrow-raising, winking-and-blinking use of italics to a degree seldom seen" ( Printing as an Index of Taste , p. 16). 27 Two poems Young published in 1726-27 offer parallel evidence that he was moving toward greater use of italics for emphasis. The Instalment (printed for J. Walthoe, 1726) is full of italics for rhetorical emphasis: a total of 103 words on 70 of the poem's 160 lines are italicized. And Cynthio (printed for J. Roberts, 1727) has 151 common names italicized on 97 of the 184 lines of the poem. 28 See "The Rationale of Copy-Text," SB , 3 (1950-51), 22. 29 Greg's phrase is taken from his discussion of the intermingling of old and newly-revised accidentals in the folio of Ben Jonson's Every Man in His Humour ("The Rationale of Copy-Text," p. 35).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">John Clay of Daventry: The Business of an Eighteenth-Century Stationer by John Feather</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The history of the book trade sometimes has broader implications that is realised; it is for example, one of the service industries whose neglect has been regretted by historians. 1 The provision of paper and writing materials is a fundamental economic service; business and commerce, and much else, cannot function without these essential supplies. In outline, at least, the pattern of supply in England is clear enough. Until the middle of the eighteenth century, England was a net importer of paper. 2 Despite an abortive attempt to establish a papermaking industry in the late fifteenth century, it was not until 1588 that John Spilman opened the first successful English paper mill. 3 Even then, growth was slow, and it was not until the 1770s that James Whatman began to produce writing paper of a sufficiently high quality to displace all the imports of Dutch paper. 4 By the 1730s, however, low grade papers were produced in quantity by English mills, and were adequate for all normal purposes. Despite the superficial difficulties in supply, paper was widely available throughout England by the early seventeenth century at the latest. This was true not only of the major centers where it was to be expected, 5 but also in much smaller communities such as Ormskirk in Lancashire (where there was a stationer in 1613), or Charlbury in Oxfordshire (1632). 6 Our concern here is with the business of a single stationer, John Clay, of Daventry in Northamptonshire, over a period of nearly 50 years from the early 1740s to the late 1770s, a history which exemplifies the trade, and from which we can study both sources of supply and the demand for paper in a small country town. 7</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Daventry Daventry is a small market town close to Watling Street (now the A5) in Northamptonshire, about 15 miles from Northampton itself. In the early eighteenth century its population was about 1,300, 8 and had risen to 2,582 by 1801. 9 The town had a claim to fame in the eighteenth century, for it was the seat of one of the most important of the nonconformist academies. The Academy was founded, in Northampton, by Philip Doddridge in 1729. It was his wish that his successor should be Caleb Ashworth, the minister at Daventry. When Doddridge died, however, Ashworth refused to move, and so the Academy moved to him in 1752. It remained in Daventry until 1789. The Academy's pupils during the Daventry years included Joseph Priestley, Samuel Palmer, and William Enfield. 10 It was also to prove of considerable significance for Clay's business.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Clay John Clay was baptised at St. Werburgh's, Derby, on 14 February 1713. (Derbyshire Record Office, D. 1145 [p]). His father, William, was a maltster according to Clay's own apprenticeship indentures, but was also at some time Post Master in Derby. 11 There was a large family of Clays in Derby; another John, apparently the stationer's uncle, was described as a maltster and innkeeper in various records from the middle of the century. 12 He, presumably, was William's successor in that part of his trade. William was certainly a man of wealth and property by provincial standards; when his son was apprenticed to John Smith, a Daventry bookseller, on 8 November 1729, he was able to pay the very substantial premium of £50. 13 Why a Daventry stationer was chosen we do not know; certainly there were stationers in Derby by that time, 14 and we may suspect, but cannot prove, a family connection between the Clays and the Smiths. Little is known of John Smith's earlier history, 15 but one Obediah Smith was a bookseller in Daventry from about 1680, and was still there in 1704 (Plomer, p. 275). Obediah Smith has been made Free of the Stationers' Company of London in 1674, 16 and it is possible that Clay's master was Obediah's son and successor. John Smith was buried at Holy Cross, Daventry, on 10 September 1742, 17 and Clay succeeded to the business immediately. His first business records date from late autumn in that year. Clay became a prominent figure in the life of his adopted town. He was a Burgess, and was elected Bailiff, the equivalent of mayor, for the first time in 1751. He held the office again in 1763, and was called upon for a third time when the elected incumbent died in 1771 (Baker, I, 322). As well as Bailiff, he was a magistrate, and several extant documents testify to his activities in that capacity. 18 He also kept some links with his native town, although he disposed of at least part of his father's property in 1741, when he sold it to William Fox, a cooper in Derby (see Deed in fn. 11). The record of Clay's marriage to his wife, Anne, has not been discovered, 19 but it may have taken place shortly after Smith's death. His eldest son, Samuel, was born in 1744, a second son, William, in 1750, and his youngest son, Thomas, in 1758 (N.R.O. 96P/18, pp. 9, 18, 32). There were, it seems, no other children. All three sons were to play a part in the running and expansion of the family business in due course. In addition to the main shop at Daventry, Clay established two branches. One, at Lutterworth in Leicestershire, may have existed as early as 1758; 20 the other, at Rugby in Warwickshire, was operational much earlier, in 1744. 21 A third branch, in Warwick, was probably initiated by Samuel in August 1770, and unlike his father, Samuel also had a small printing business. 22a The whole business was a profitable one. Even before he was in charge, Clay was able to give £1.1s.od. to a subscription for new bells for Holy Cross church. In 1743, he gave a further 10s.6d.for 'chimes' for the church clock. 22b It is, however, the continuity and expansion of the business which is the real testimony to its success. John Clay was buried at Holy Cross on 18 November 1775, a respected citizen and a successful businessman (N.R.O. 96P/18, p. 122).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Clay's stock The shops at Daventry, Lutterworth and Rugby, were essentially similar in the range of goods stocked and sold. No inventory of stock is extant, but the records of sales can show the relative importance of the various classes of goods on sale. To illustrate this, two typical months have been taken, one for Daventry and one for Lutterworth (Table I). The figures for Daventry (Table I, column (a)) give the clearest and fullest picture of the business. Primarily, Clay was a stationer, dealing in paper and printed forms. The sale of books was the only other significant part of his trade. A more detailed analysis shows that the range of stock was comparatively wide. He sold paper of several sizes and varieties, such as 'Post' and 'Pott', 23 as well as notebooks of various kinds. He also stocked 'skins', that is sheets of vellum used for legal documents, including 'Text' skins which were blank forms of such documents. In addition, he sold various items of writing equipment, such as pens, pencils, rulers, and ink. The books sold at Daventry were mainly schoolbooks in use at the Academy. It was the beginning of the school year, and, as a consequence, seven boys bought copies of Nathan Bailey's English and Latin exercises for schoolboys , first published in 1706 and reprinted many times. This was probably used for the first year of the classical course. 24 Another first year book was William Willymott's A select century of Corderius's Colloquies , and a third schoolbook of which multiple copies were sold was William Turner's Exercises to the accidence . Apart from the schoolbooks, the trade in books was small: a copy of Rowe's Poetical works ; one of Joseph's Tripp's Praelectiones poeticae ; a few chapbooks; a couple of magazines; and twelve Books of Common Prayer, presumably for Holy Cross. A roughly comparable picture emerges from the analysis of a month's sales at Lutterworth ten years later. The figures in Table I, column (b), are distorted by an exceptional purchase. On 15 October 1778, the Churchwardens of Misterton, a village about 1 miles east of Lutterworth, bought new books for their church: a Bible (£3.10s.od.); a large Prayer Book for the reading desk (18s.od.); and a book of the occasional offices (2s.6d.). If we exclude this £4.10s.od., we arrive at a 'normal' month's sales. This adjustment is made in Table I, column (c). Again, the sale of stationery is preponderant, representing rather more than half of sales, with books contributing just under one-third. The stationery goods are much like those at Daventry ten years earlier, but the books are rather different. There are no academic books, and only one school book; most are part publications 25 and magazines. The shop established at Warwick by Samuel Clay in 1770 was similarly stocked. Samuel's account book (N.R.O. D.2929) shows that he received the stock from his father; he did, however, pay for it, and the Warwick business was clearly treated as a separate enterprise. Nevertheless, Clay gave his son a good deal of help including, on 10 December 1770, a loan of £20. The goods received by Samuel from John on 17 August 1770 are a useful exemplar of the range of the stock: £ s d 6 Bottles of Elixer of Health 6 1 Paper Book 6 q. rs Rul'd 4 9 1 D not Rul'd 4 3 1 D 5 q. rs Rul'd ruff Calf 4 8 12 Bottles Bostock's Elixer 9 2 Highway Acts 1 6 2 Turnpike D 1 6 3 Forms of Proceedings 1 2 Tutors for y e Flute 1 6 1 D Fife 9 2 Pillman's Writing Illustrated 2 6 -------- 1 17 5 -------- Again it is stationery and blank forms which are predominant, representing 14s.8d. . Books and pamphlets account for 7s.9d., and the remaining 15s.od. is an exceptionally large purchase of medicine. The sale of medicine had long been associated with the book trade, 26 but sales were slow (see Table I), and Samuel was clearly stocking-up. The music books are also interesting, since they represent another of Samuel's sidelines, music and musical instruments. A few days later he bought '½ Bundle 3. d Strings' for violins, also supplied by his father. One final aspect of the business deserves to be mentioned, that of bookbinding. The only records which date back to Smith's time relate to his activities as a bookbinder, 27 in which he did a substantial trade. He bought tools and materials in 1717-18, and in several years thereafter. A number of names appear, including those of John Cooke and David Rice; they may have been either the suppliers, or the employees who actually did the binding work. On 27 November 1717 Smith calculated his profits on binding since 11 June as £15.5s.3d., but the record of books bound stops in 1724, and does not resume until 1763. At that time, Clay bought materials, and there are records of books bound between 1763 and 1772. Possibly there was a lack of skilled labour, for if no binding was done after 1724 it may be that there was no-one to teach Clay this craft during his apprenticeship. When the binding records resume, they show that little work was done, and the figures in Table I may be taken as typical. Overall, the business operated by Clay was that of a stationer who also sold books. Well over half of his income, and sometimes as much as three-quarters, came from the sale of stationery goods, of which he had a substantial and diverse stock. Bookselling, although of some cultural importance in these small market towns, was economically of far less importance. In other words, by the middle of the eighteenth century, these south midland towns could all sustain a well-established and profitable stationer's shop. The details of that sustenance, as shown by Clay's records of retail sales, will be discussed below. Before turning to that, however, we must deal with Clay's suppliers, on whom he depended for his stock-in-trade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sources of supply The record of supplies and payments may be intermittent, but it covers the whole period of Clay's independent business life from 1742 to 1774. 28 Like Clay, we can most conveniently divide the suppliers into London and country, dealing first with the latter. The country suppliers, country 'chapmen' as Clay called them although few if any were travellers, were chiefly local men, although there are a few examples of Clay dealing with traders as far away as Gloucestershire and Cheshire. Obviously, paper was the most important constituent of Clay's stock, and his sources indicate the extent to which papermaking had become a native industry by the middle of the eighteenth century. Indeed, almost all of the records of paper buying are from English mills. Clay's chief supplier was Robert Allen of Boughton Mill, near Northampton. Boughton Mill was ancient, but had first been used for papermaking as recently as 1717, when it was taken over by one Mr. Allen ( VCH Northamts , IV, 79). The Robert Allen with whom Clay dealt in the early 1740s was probably this man's son, for he did not die until 1797. 29 By that time his own son, Joseph, was in charge of the mill, as he had been since at least 1786. 30 In the early 1740s, when the records appear to be complete, Clay bought consignments of paper about once a month, and sometimes more frequently. In 1744, for example, there were 15 different transactions. Most were small, averaging about £2, but over the years it represented a substantial trade. Between January 1743 and March 1745, for example, Clay spent a total of £62.16s.3d. on Allen's paper. A typical single purchase is that of 7 December 1743: 1 R m . Large} Brown 5 0 8 R m . F [olio]} 18 0 2 R m . White Cap 9 0 2 R m . D . F [olio] 6 6 1 R m . Blew Cap 4 6 -------- 2 3 0 -------- The white Foolscap ('Cap') and folio paper was always the most important part of Clay's stock of writing paper. Brown wrapping paper is also frequently mentioned. The Foolscap at 4s.6d per ream was reasonably priced; in 1784, after a sharp rise in the price of paper, the 'official' value of a ream of this quality of Foolscap, for revenue purposes, was 9s.od. 31 On the other hand, in October 1746, Clay bought similar paper at 4s.od. per ream from John Jones of North Newington Mill, near Banbury. Jones was, in fact, Clay's second most important country supplier after Allen. He was at North Newington throughout Clay's independent career. 32 In 1746 alone Clay paid him a total of £25.10s.3d.. Primarily he supplied Clay with wrapping paper, often in large quantities, including, for example, 32 reams between 17 and 24 September 1746. He did supply some writing paper, but for this Clay generally relied on Allen. Clay's other provincial paper suppliers, all on a much smaller scale, included Thomas Ashby, of Brandon Mill, at Ryton, near Coventry (Shorter, p. 242); Mary and John Oram, stationers in Coventry who owned Beoley Mills in Worcestershire in the 1760s; 33 and John Durham, of Winchombe in Gloucestershire. Durham may not have been a papermaker, 34 but rather a wholesale stationer. Clay dealt with him on a number of occasions; the most elaborate series of recorded transactions was in 1749-50, when Clay received parcels with unspecified contents to a total value of £110.18s.9d. The real explanation for Clay's dealings with Durham, however, is probably to be found in the fact that he supplied him with bottles of Cheltenham Water to which he had easy access in Gloucestershire. One supplier who was certainly a wholesale stationer was Dickinson Boys, of Louth, in Lincolnshire. Boys was in business from 1719 to 1767, and transformed the little stationer's shop which he had inherited from his uncle into a large and prosperous business with wide regional, and even national, contacts. 35 Clay bought pocket books from him as well as sheets of paper and also, on one occasion, binding supplies. Another supplier of pocket books, and probably of binding materials, was John Skoopholme, a bookbinder in Bristol, with whom Clay was dealing in 1749 and 1750. For books, Clay dealt with the London booksellers, as will be discussed below, but, apart from the schoolbooks at Daventry, and part books and magazines, his book trade was chiefly in chapbooks and ballads. These were the largest category of books published in the provinces, and Clay followed the usual pattern in using easily accessible local sources. His chief suppliers were in Coventry: Thomas Luckman, owner of The Coventry Mercury who was the city's most important bookseller and printer; J. W. Piercy, who succeeded to Luckman's business in 1771; and John Bailye, a chapbook publisher in the 1770s, one of several members of his family in the book trade. 36 Typically, Clay's orders were for chapbooks, or chapbook format editions of such works as Isaac Watt's Divine songs , in multiples of 12. Less frequently, copies of individual titles were ordered on commission for a customer. 37 Ballad sheets came chiefly from two printers: Francis Makepiece (or Makepeace), a bookseller and printer at Southam, in Warwickshire, from the late 1760s until at least 1792; 38a and John Cheney, of Banbury, Oxfordshire, who started a printing business in 1767, and soon came to specialise in ballad and chapbook printing. 38b These sheets were bought by the ream. Clay's dealings with provincial booksellers were very few. From John Baskerville, the Birmingham printer, he bought a copy of his Prayer Book (in 1760), and great Folio Bible (1763). He also dealt with Robert Martin and Thomas Warren of Birmingham, but each on one occasion only, in 1771 and 1761 respectively. The only other supplier of books, or rather of a single book in 1750, was Thomas Merrill of the famous Cambridge bookselling firm (Plomer, pp. 17-18, 164, 257, 168-169). Clay went further afield in buying the miscellaneous supplies which were integral to his trade. We have already noted that Durham supplied Cheltenham Water, but the chief supplier of medicine who appears in the country accounts was Henry Smith of Oundle. Clay bought 11 dozen bottles of 'Tincture' from him between 1743 and 1752. Another tradesman in Oundle, Henry Austin, whom Clay describes as a hatter, supplied medicine between 1761 and 1768, and in 1771-73 John Leeming of Coventry appears several times in the accounts for the same reason. Other supplies came from Heatley Noble of Birmingham (pens, pen cases, ink, ink pots, sealing wax, and string, in 1757); Robert Taylor of Nantwich in Cheshire (quills on several occasions, 1755-61); Henry Walter of Birmingham ('7 Vellum Skins for Binding', 1764); and Edward Laxton of Peterborough, and James Thompson, whose place of residence is not given (both quills, 1742-76). Although the records of purchases may be incomplete the general pattern of provincial purchasing is clear. Clay bought most of his paper direct from nearby mills, using one supplier, Allen, chiefly for writing paper, and another, Jones, chiefly for wrapping paper. This was supplemented with paper and blank books from wholesale stationers like Boys and the Orams. He bought ballads and chapbooks direct from the printers, and a very few books through other booksellers in the larger towns. All of these were in a fairly small area around Daventry, with a few exceptions like Durham, Boys, and Merrill. For medicine and other goods, Clay went farther afield if he had to, but the manufacturers and distributors of the south midlands were able to fulfill the greater part of his needs. For only two classes of goods did Clay have to resort to London: books (other than chapbooks and ballads), and imported paper. The London accounts are rather less specific than those with the country suppliers. Clay tended to record merely that he had bought and paid for a number of parcels, without noting their contents. In fact, most of the London tradesmen with whom he dealt appear to have been wholesale stationers, like John Loveday of Fish Street Hill, 39 and others. He also bought some medicine from London suppliers, since, of course, patent medicines could only be bought from the patentees or their assigns; his medicine suppliers included How and Masterman of Gracechurch Street, and Francis Newbery. Newbery is particularly interesting in this respect. He was the son of John, the original patentee of Dr. James's Fever Powder (see note 26), and published many children's books and chapbooks. Significantly, Clay never seems to have bought books from him, for he was publishing precisely the kind of books which were available more easily from country printers like Cheney and Bailye (Maxted, p. 161; Plomer, Bushnell, and Dix, p. 178). The bookseller with whom Clay dealt most frequently over the years was James Hodges, one of the most distinguished members of the London trade. He was Clerk of the City of London, and was knighted when he presented an Address to George II in 1758 (Plomer, etc. , pp. 127-128). He was a publisher of practical books of all kinds, on crafts, science, and arts, which proved to be very popular. He also, however, supplied Clay with books published by others as well as his own, and seems to have acted, in effect, as Clay's London agent. Clay did have direct dealings with some other London booksellers, including James Buckland (from 1756), Thomas Payne (from 1759), and Richard Baldwin (from 1763). Indeed, the general impression is that these dealings increased substantially over the years, and that Clay began to buy more books from the middle of his career onwards. This is, to some extent, confirmed by the records of sales at all the shops. Clay also dealt directly with the publishers of some of the magazines which were important to the trade of any provincial booksellers. He dealt with Edward Cave, the founder of The Gentleman's Magazine (from 1742); John Wheble, the publisher of The Lady's Magazine (from 1771); and others. In general, however, Clay's dealings with London were less important to the maintenance of his stock than his dealings with country tradesmen. There were problems of distance, cost, and means of payment. Above all, there was the fact that the local paper mills could supply, cheaply, the basic constituent of his stock, and this needed only a little supplementation from the London wholesalers. If he had had a larger trade in books, Clay would have been obliged to deal more with the London bookseller/publishers. As it was, he never really had a stock of books at all, except for chapbooks and ballads, and at Daventry, and possibly at Rugby, school textbooks of which the sale was almost guaranteed. Clay normally bought books only on commission for customers; indeed in the late 1740s, when he was newly in charge of the business, he was obliged to return a large number of 'books unsold' to Charles Hitch of Paternoster Row. The conclusion might be that he had attempted to stock the shop beyond the capacity of his market.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Clay's customers Finally, we turn to Clay's sales. Of the surviving documents, the majority are day books of sales, or records of customers' accounts. The day books are probably records of sales to credit account customers, and of major cash sales; there do not appear to be any notes of other sales, although some otherwise inexplicable notes may relate to small cash transactions. From these documents we can build up a fairly comprehensive picture of Clay's customers, and of the role of the stationer's shop in the life of a small town. At Daventry, the most consistently valuable customer was Thomas Caldecott. For example, in October 1768 (Table I, column (a)), he spent £6.5s.7d., nearly one-third of the recorded takings for the month. Caldecott was a lawyer; he was Recorder of Daventry from 1743 until his death in 1774 (Baker, I, 323). His purchases included paper, vellum, printed forms, ink, and pens. Another lawyer, Harris, also spent a substantial sum. At Lutter-worth the principal customer was once again a lawyer, Mr. Worthington; his purchases were very similar to those of Caldecott and Harris. Clay was crucial to the lawyers, not merely as a supplier of paper, but also because he was a Stamp Distributor. 40 The ubiquity of the stamp duties, 41 and the fact that stationers sold the documents to which the stamps were affixed, made a distributorship, which was a local monopoly, both logical and desirable for the seller of paper and vellum. Indeed it was often said that distributors increased their profits by overcharging for the stamps, 42 but there is no evidence against Clay in this regard. In fact, Clay was typical of country stationers in building his business around the supply of law stationery. 43 Other customers bought a few quires of writing paper from time to time, but this was a much less significant part of Clay's trade. Most of the customers were either the gentry of the locality, or Clay's fellow tradesmen. Among the book buyers, one group can be clearly distinguished from all the others: the tutors and students of Daventry Academy. It was, of course, they who bought the school textbooks and academic books which we noted at Daventry. Most of the other books sold were chapbooks and ballads, 44 some of them in bulk to pedlars and chapmen. Again, most of the customers were tradesmen, or minor gentry, many of whom also used Clay as a subscription agent for periodicals. Periodicals became an increasingly important part of Clay's trade, following the national trend of the great popularity of the monthly magazines in the middle of the century, following the success of the formula developed by Cave for The Gentleman's Magazine . From Daventry in 1770, for example, Clay was supplying The Gentleman's Magazine (to 23 customers), The London Magazine (34), The Universal Museum (4), The Critical Review (10), The Court Magazine (16), The Universal Magazine (12), The Royal Magazine (10), The Oxford Magazine (15), The Ladies Magazine (22), and two others, 'Review' (8), and 'The Gentleman's Museum' (49), 45 which cannot be identified. There can be no doubt that Clay had a successful business career. That career illustrates a number of general points of importance. Firstly, it shows that even in a small market town remote from the new economic and industrial developments the pace and organisation of life was such that there was a growing need for documentation, and hence for the services of a stationer. A society which was becoming more complex, and subject to more taxation, had need of written and printed records on a far greater scale. Secondly, there were efficient mechanisms for the supply of the goods which the stationer sold, and the English paper industry was able to meet most of his demands. Thirdly, printed matter of all kinds was available even in small towns, although the demand was for a fairly limited range. Nevertheless, towards the end of his career, Clay was catering for a larger audience for books and magazines, a reflection of the growth in the popularity of the reading habit. John Clay 'Booksell r a Burgess of this Corporat n ', was buried at Holy Cross, Daventry, on 18 November 1775 (N.R.O. 96P/18, p. 122). He had outlived his second son, for William had died in his twenty-second year, shortly after becoming an ironmonger in Rugby. His body was brought back to Daventry, and he was buried there on 18 June 1772 ( ibid. , p. 118). The other two boys survived their father, although Thomas only for 6 years; he too was brought home for burial, on 26 July 1781 (N.R.O. 96P/19 Burials, p. 7). The whole enterprise which his father had established was now in the care of the eldest son, Samuel, who survived to the age of 56, and joined his parents and brothers in Holy Cross churchyard on 13 March 1800 ( ibid. , p. 50). He was the last of the Clays of Daventry, and the business apparently came to end with his life.</field>

D.2931, p. 14, has a reference to a customer in Lutterworth in that year. 21 N.R.O. D.2412, a ledger from the Rugby shop, begins in that year. 22a N.R.O. D.2929 is Samuel's ledger from Warwick. The stocking-up was between 12 and 27 August 1770. Samuel was also a hatter, according to Mr. R. J.

The connection arose from the similarity of distribution mechanisms; I have discussed the subject more fully in The provincial book trade in eighteenth-century England (forthcoming). 27 The only records of Smith's business are in N.R.O. D.4844, which are his binding accounts. Clay revived the use of this ledger when he revived the binding operation. 28 N.R.O.

According to him, Clay also had connections with Elizabeth Jopson, Luckman's predecessor and founder of The Coventry Mercury ; he was distributor of A book of accounts for the use of surveyors of the highways , which she published in 1767. 37 In some ledgers (e.g., N.R.O. D.2925, 2926, 2928-31) there are scribbled notes which include bespoke orders. 38a The first reference to him in Clay's accounts is in 1769; the last so far noticed is in The Universal British Directory in 1792. Mr Chamberlaine-Brothers has noted several references to him in The Coventry Mercury , 1779-88. 38b See John Cheney and his successors (1936). 39 Ian Maxted, The London book trades 1775-1800 (1977), p. 141; and D.

The large number of subscriptions suggests that this might be so.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Isaac Reed and the European Magazine by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The European Magazine and London Review (hereafter EM ), printed for John Fielding, John Debrett, and John Sewell began its existence in January 1782. In a letter dated 5 August 1782 Isaac Reed wrote to William Julius Mickle that he had "no opportunity of speaking to Fielding until late in the last month. He is very desirous of having your assistance in his magazine," the first indication of Reed's possible involvement in the EM . 1 In a second letter, dated 13 November 1782, Reed again wrote to Mickle and told him, among other things, "While I have been writing, a letter from Fielding is come to me in which he says that his editor was so dilatory last month that he has been obliged to discharge him and wishes I would give him some assistance till he can get settled again. . . . I have no objection to rendering him a temporary aid" (Gilmer, p. 206). I believe I can show that Reed's temporary aid lasted until the time of his death and that despite one recorded disclaimer he was editor in fact if not in name for the roughly twenty-five years from November 1782 to his death early in January 1807. First the disclaimer: Henry Meen, a friend of Reed's, writing to Bishop Percy in Ireland on 25 November 1799, told Percy that Reed asserts he is not the editor of the European Magazine , "nor does he wish to be so considered." Indeed, as Meen wrote, "Mr. Reed seems to be somewhat displeased" to be consulted by Percy "under the character of editor of the abovementioned Magazine. 2 In a letter of 8 Oct. 1789, Reed's very good friend Dr. Ralph Heathcote reminded him, "Thou hast had three commissions to execute a long time, and I am afraid The European Magazine and other important avocations will never suffer them to take place." Next year Heathcote wrote to complain he had not heard from Reed for a year and wished he could "find time from the European Magazine ," and in 1791 he wrote to tell Reed that he had dropped his subscription to the magazine, adding, "however, I am glad it flourishes, as you are so mainly interested in it." 3 James Boaden, in whose company Reed dined at "Mr. Kemble's" on 18 January 1801, in his Life of John Philip Kemble (2 vols. (1825), II. 432), stated that Reed "ably and steadily conducted his magazine [the EM ] for [the next] twenty-five years and amid all the changes of opinion, adhered inflexibly to his own." The sheer number of Reed's own contributions to the EM from 1782 through 1806, the contributions of others for which he was demonstrably responsible, and the very good probability that a number of other contributions were encouraged or solicited by him all add up to his being the prime mover in the policies and conduct of the magazine. On 11 August 1783 Reed recorded a "Meeting of the Proprietors of the European Magazine " in his diary, followed a month later with a second meeting in which "Mr. Reed presented a Sketch of the Articles to be hereafter agreed upon and Ordered to be considered against the next meeting." At the 12 March 1784 meeting of the proprietors, of whom Reed was, of course, one, it was "Agreed . . . that Mr. Reed draw up on Advertizt to be produced at the next meeting. . . . That the Magazine for the present be deposited in Mr. Reed's Chambers No. 3 Staple Inn as soon as possible." On the twenty-fifth the proprietors agreed "That the Plates be deposited in a Box in Mr. Reed's Chambers" ( Diaries , p. 274; see also p. 276 for other meetings). When Reed died and his library was sold, among other items listed were "Letters, relating to Articles that have appeared in the European Magazine " (p. 399): "Miscellaneous Prints, several from European Magazine "; "Forty-three Portraits, published for European Magazine chiefly proofs "; five more items immediately following, simply listed as "Ditto"; and "Prints to the European Magazine , a large parcel" (p. 404). Sixteen years after Reed's death, W. Howe issued a Catalogue of the Genuine Collection of Prints of the Late Isaac Reed, ESQ . . . . which listed some 1900 portraits and 600 "Topographical Views, etc." under the general heading of "Proofs and Prints from the European Magazine ." Reed's indignation at Bishop Percy's assuming that he was editor of the magazine may be put down to his extreme reluctance to be known as the author or editor of anything, writing to John Nichols, for example, "I declare I have such a horror of seeing my name as Author or Editor, that if I had the option of standing in the pillory, or in standing formally before the publick in either of those lights, I should find it difficult which to choose" ( Diaries , p. 265). It was not until 1803 that he allowed his name to appear on a title-page. I wrote above of "the sheer number of Reed's own contributions to the EM ," a statement that would seem to be in conflict with the fact that he has hitherto been known to have contributed only four pieces and possibly a fifth. 4 Yet both John Nichols and James Bindley make statements that contradict what is known about Reed's contributions, the first writing quite unambiguously that Reed "was a constant contributor to it for many years, particularly in the biographical and critical departments," and the second, much less clearly, stating that Reed "for many years maintained the character and respectability" of the magazine ( Lit. Anecd. II. 667; EM 51 [Feb. 1807], 86). I have identified fifty-five contributions by Reed, one of them in three parts and three others in two parts, alerted to these by a correspondent in the January 1810 EM (p. 24) who stated that a "C. D." who had enthusiastically written about Thomas Randolph and his play The Muse's Looking Glass in remarks supplementary to Joseph Moser's in the January 1803 EM (p. 17) was Isaac Reed. Reed had simply taken the last letter of his two names for his signature, a not uncommon practice with correspondents to the periodicals, as, for example, Richar d Goug h and Samue l Pegg e in the Gentleman's Magazine . Although I have searched in vain for C. D.'s remarks on Randolph in the EM , Reed's biographical sketch of the playwright and his praise of The Muse's Looking Glass in the 1782 Biographia Dramatica (I. 365-367) are consonant with the statements of the pseudonymous correspondent in the 1810 EM . 5 Most of Reed's contributions as C. D. are reprintings of various letters, poems, memoranda, and other documents with an introductory headnote. In what follows I list these in chronological order with some comments which corroborate Reed's identity as C. D. and with quotation of some passages of interest. VII (March 1785), 180. On the two versions of the first stanza of Edward Fairfax's translation of Tasso, anticipating John Payne Collier in the Critical Review , 5th series, vol. 5 (1817), 193-204. XI (Feb. 1787), 65-66. Three extracts from Mist's Weekly Journal , 1727 and 1728, on Milton. Part of the first extract is quoted in William Riley Parker's biography of Milton (pp. 1164-65). XI (April 1787), 221-222. Reed reprints a "Character of Sir Paul Pyndar" from a pamphlet entitled Vox Veritatis . . . , by "Thomas Browne, Gent. 4to. Printed 1683" ( STC 5185). XII (July 1787), 42-47. Samuel Johnson's The Fountains reprinted. Reed points out in his headnote that the tale is not to be found in Sir John Hawkins's edition of Johnson's works. Reed included the tale in an added (fourteenth) volume of the works which he edited in 1788. XII (Aug. 1787), 107-108. The first printing of a Garrick letter (No. 912 in the Little and Kahrl edition of the Garrick letters). XII (Sept. 1787), 181. Two letters, Hans Sloane to Sir Richard Blackmore and Blackmore's reply. Not in Albert Rosenberg's biography of Blackmore. First printed here. Not in Samuel Ayscough's catalogue of MSS in the British Museum (1782). XIII (Feb. 1788), 77-78. Samuel Johnson's Preface to Payne's Universal Chronicle reprinted. Not in Hawkins nor in Reed's additional volume of the collected works. XIII (March 1788), 161. The originals of two letters from Colley Cibber to Dr. William Oliver. I have not found them in biographical accounts of either man. Reed asked that the letters "be printed literally with all their peculiarities" and went on to discuss "the unsettled state of orthography at the time ]1742[ these letters were written," adding that he had some letters of Pope's which would "show that he also was very negligent on this subject." XIII (April 1788), 237-238. Two letters copied from the original MSS. of Thomas Baker (see below) on the subject of Edmund Spenser. The letters are not in the Index to the Baker Manuscripts , 1848, which covers the holdings of the British Library and the Cambridge University Library. I have not seen the Baker letters in the Bodleian. XV (Feb. 1789), 88. Extracts of two letters from Conyers Middleton to Lord Hervey, reprinted, writes Reed, from "a Newspaper, I think the St. James's Chronicle, near Thirty Years ago." Not mentioned in Robert Halsband's biography of Lord Hervey. They are from British Library Add. MSS. 5846 f. 21. Reed wrote a manuscript life of Middleton (Gilmer, p. 22). XVI (Sept. 1789), 168-169, "Some Account of the Life of James Gibbs, Esq. the Celebrated Architect" was, according to Reed, "published immediately after his death in the News-paper of the Day." The EM "Account" is taken verbatim from the Scots Magazine (Sept. 1760), pp. 475-476 in the form of a letter from Aberdeen. The DNB account of Gibbs omits some of the details in the EM , including a humorous anecdote about his father. XVIII (Sept. 1790), 167-168. Anecdotes of Anthony Benezet. Reed's anecdotes are at least once at variance with, and contain material not in, Memoirs of the Life of Anthony Benezet by Roberts Vaux (Philadelphia, 1817, reprinted in London). XVIII (Sept. 1790), 177-182. Letters of Dr. John Shebbeare and Sir Robert Fletcher. The EM is among the bibliographical references in the DNB account of Shebbeare. XIX (June 1791), 415-416. Richard Farmer's "Directions for the Study of English History" (see below). XX (July and Aug. 1791), 21-24, 101-103. In a long headnote Reed gives a biographical sketch of Sir Charles Whitworth, letters to and from whom he reprints. The Calendar of State Papers has yet to cover the period of these letters, although a number of others are printed in the volumes of the Historical Manuscripts Commission . XX (Sept. 1791), 169. A letter of Lord Chesterfield to the unnamed Dr. William Dodd for whose identity as recipient Reed had "the best authority." Reed edited Dodd's Thoughts in Prison ( Diaries , pp. 263, 268). The letter is number 2443 in Bonamy Dobrée's edition of Chesterfield's Correspondence (p. 2751). XX (Oct. 1791), 285-288. Reed corrects an error in Boswell's account of Richard Savage in the Life of Johnson. A letter from Savage to Theophilus Cibber is quoted. An extract from the letter is quoted in Clarence Tracy's biography of Savage, p. 44, n. 18. One of the longest of Reed's contributions. XX (Dec. 1791), 410-411. Reed proves an anonymous pamphlet attributed to Lord Somers was not by him. DNB notes that the pamphlet's "authenticity is doubtful." XXI (June 1792), 421-424. "The following EXTRACTS were made many Years ago from the Manuscript mentioned by Mr. [William] Ellis in his 'CAMPAGNA OF LONDON,' and are at the Service of The EUROPEAN MAGAZINE." These are "Extracts from [Edward] ALLEYN'S JOURNAL; entitled 'The FOUNDERS 1st Booke of Accounts, from October 1617, to September, 1622." This is from MS. NO. IX in George F. Warner's Catalogue of the Manuscripts and Muniments of Alleyn's College of God's Gift at Dulwich (London, 1881), pp. 165-195 and contains some information lacking in Webster's selections of "some other items of interest" (p. 166). The extracts in the EM were unknown to Webster who lists other printed extracts on pp. 194-195. XXII (Oct. 1792), 254-255. "The following circumstantial and artless account of the Catastrophe of the celebrated and accomplished EARL of ESSEX, is copied from an ancient manuscript which has the title 'The Execution of the sometime good Earle of Essex.' As it has never been printed, and contains some circumstances not to be found in Camden's account, I send it to be inserted in your Magazine." XXII (Oct. 1792), 257-262. Reed writes a long headnote prefatory to printing the hitherto unprinted "ACCOUNT of Mr. RUSSELL's JOURNEY from GIBRALTAR to SALLEE, MEQUINEZ, and FEZ, and of his Return back again by Way of TANGIER; beginning the 7th of June 1729, and ending the 10th of August following." The Account "contains a Sequel to 'The History of the Revolutions of the Empire of Morocco, upon the Death of the late Emperor Muley Ishmael, by Captain [John] Braithwaite, who accompanied John Russell, ESQ. his Majesty's Consul-General, into those Parts, and was an Eye-Witness to the most remarkable Occurrences therein mentioned." DNB gives the dates covered by Russell's account as July 1727 to Feb. 1728. XXII (Dec. 1792), 409-413. On the death of Dr. Godfrey Goodman, Bishop of Gloucester, who died "in the faith and communion of the Mother Church of Rome." Most of the information in Reed's contribution, taken from various named sources, will be found in the DNB account of Bishop Goodman except for an interpolated italicized note on p. 413 of the EM . XXIII (Feb. 1793), 84-85. An account by Reed of Robert Fleming, a dissenting divine who prophesied the emptying of the fourth phial of the Book of Revelations. Reed's bibliography of Fleming's works includes a title, A Practical Discourse occasioned by the Death of King William, wherein a character of him is given . To which is added, a poetical Essay on his Memory , which does not appear in the DNB or in the British Library catalogue of printed books. XXV (Feb. 1794), 95-96. Reed gives some biographical data about Edward Gibbon, also quoting some marginalia of Charles James Fox about Gibbon in his copy of the first volume of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . These include a poem on Gibbon by Fox beginning "King George in a fright, | Lest Gibbon should write | The story of Britain's disgrace." I have found no mention of the poem in an admittedly not exhaustive search of works on Gibbon and Fox. There is no entry for Gibbon, for example, in the index to John W. Derry's Charles James Fox (London, 1972) despite the friendship of the two men. XXV (Feb. and April 1794), 108-110, 265-267. Reed writes "A course of very miscellaneous reading led me a few years since to note the various Instances of Longevity which occurred to me" and quotes from the Public Advertiser (largely), "Rudder's Gloucestershire," the "Historical Register" and a few other sources. XXVI (Sept. 1794), 169-171. "I transmit for your Magazine the Copy of a Letter from the late LORD BATHURST [Henry, 2nd Earl Bathurst], and, as I believe, in his own Hand-writing. It does not appear to whom it was sent, having neither Signature, Address, nor Date: the latter, however, was certainly in the Year 1735. It contains some of the Politics of the Times; and to explain it the better, I have added a few notes." The letter is not mentioned in John Campbell's Lives of the Lord Chancellors . . . of England (5 vols. 1846); Bathurst was a Lord Chancellor. XXVII (Jan. 1795), 44-46. In a long headnote Reed explains something about a seventeenth-century pamphlet by James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby, which he reprints. The Declaration (the first word of the long title) is noticed in the DNB and in Collins's Peerage . XXVII (Feb. 1795), 80. "I send for your Repository two original Letters which have never been printed; one from Mr. Pope, the other from Stephen Duck. The former was transcribed from the copy of Homer now in the British Museum, many years since; the other is the original in the hand of the threshing Poet." The Pope letter is at II. 181 in George Sherburn's edition of Pope's letters; the Duck letter to Dr. Oliver of Bath is noted in the DNB account of Duck. XXVII (June 1795), 365-368. "Some Account of Ralph Heathcote, D. D. Written in 1789, by Himself." For Heathcote and Reed, see above. XXVIII (July 1795), 14-15. "The following Memoranda, copied some years ago from loose papers found in Bene't College, Cambridge, may perhaps afford some entertainment to your readers." Expenses for "y e settyng forth of y e Comedye of Job" in the year 1553. Not listed in the Harbage-Schoenbaum Annals of the English Drama , 975-1700 . XXIX (Feb. 1796), 91. An account of Sir John Laurence. Sheriff of London (1658) and Lord Mayor (1665). Reed quotes a description of the terrible plague in Sir John's mayoralty from William Maitland's History of London (2 vols., 1775). XXIX (March 1796), 148-150. In a long original contribution Reed blasts Gilbert Wakefield for a false anecdote about Dr. Frederic Cornwallis, "late Archbishop of Canterbury" in Wakefield's Observations on Pope . The anecdote is not mentioned in the DNB account of Archbishop Cornwallis. Reed appends a letter from Bishop Hough to Lord Digby, later published in John Wilmot's life of the Bishop (1812), pp. 86-88. XXX (Oct. 1796), 244-246. "The following Letters from the celebrated LORD ROCHESTER to his Lady were given me, many years ago, by a DERBYSHIRE BARONET, who assured me they were never printed. . . . they place the character of this licentious Nobleman in a rather new point of view." The seven letters are known. XXX (Oct. 1796), 249-251. "Extracts from the Register book of the Parish of Amwell, near Ware, in Hertfordshire," ranging from 1567 to 1599. Reed was buried at Amwell, having visited there often. XXX (Nov. 1796), 324-328. "As a Sequel to the Account of the Journey of the TESHOO LAMA printed in your Magazine Vol. XXVI, p. 249, I send you a Translation of the EMPEROR of CHINA's Letter to the DALAI LAMA, on the Death of TESHOO LAMA." XXXI (Feb. 1797), 86-87. Reed gives the original complete Prologue to William Henry Ireland's Vortigern, one from which, he writes, "you will see that the Author was not so firm a believer [that Shakespeare wrote the play] as he has been generally supposed." The abbreviated prologue appeared in the EM in April 1796 (p. 272). XXXII (Dec. 1797), 386-389. A reprinting of Oliver Goldsmith's story of Miss Frances Braddock, from the biography of Beau Nash, with six notes by Reed. Reed wrote a short biography of Goldsmith for volume II of Goldsmith's Essays (1795). An end note signed "Editor" may be by Reed. XXXIII (Jan. 1798), 9-10. "The following Three Letters are literally copied from the Originals, with all their peculiarities of spelling in the hand-writing of the Author of Hudibras." On Thursday 25 Sept. 1788 Reed noted that Richard Farmer "again recommended to me the republication of Butler's Works for the executn. of which he lent me the materials he had collected." Two years later, again at Emmanuel College where Farmer was Master, Reed "sat down to Butler's Manuscript," and when Dr. Treadway Nash's edition of Hudibras was published in 1793 it contained manuscript notes of Zachary Grey, the former editor of Hudibras , supplied by Reed ( Diaries , pp. 161, 185, 286). The first letter is dated "Junii 28" and is "For Dr. Luke Ridgely, my most honoured friend"; the second letter, undated and addressed to "Deare Madam" ("If you had pleasd to have weighd my words. . .") was "on the same paper"; and the third, to his "Deare Sister," can be found in Butler's Satires and Miscellaneous Poetry and Prose , ed. by René Lamar (1928) p. 399. There are numerous differences of spelling and punctuation in the two versions of the letter to his sister. Dr. Ridgely's name is given as "Dr. Luke Rugeley" in William Munk's Roll of the Royal College of Physicians of London , 2nd ed. (1878), I. 267-268, where an obituary notice is quoted: "Dr. Luke Rugeley, a very eminent and famous physician, died in his house, in Bloomsbury-square, the beginning of this week [5 Sept., 1697], in the 81st year of his age, and has committed his choice secret of curing sore eyes to a surgeon of this city, for whom he had an entire affection." Alumni Cantabrigienses gives both spellings of the name. I have found no reference to Ridgely or to the first two letters in the literature on Butler, including Treadway Nash's edition of Hudibras (1793), on which, as noted above, he was assisted by Reed. XXXIV (July 1798), 9-10. "In the new Edition of Lord Orford's Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors (a very imperfect and erroneous Compilation, as I may probably at a future time demonstrate to you), mention is made of the following Dialogue by Lord Chesterfield as remaining still in Manuscript. A Copy of it has been several years in my possession; and therefore, as it may gratify some of your readers, I transmit it to you for your publication. Lord Orford calls it 'A Dialogue in Prose on his (Lord Chesterfield's) going to Court, 1762.' See Lord Orford's Works, Vol. i., p. 538." Thomas Park's edition of Horace Walpole's Catalogue (1806) contains a number of handsome acknowledgments of the help given by Reed, who had offered Walpole a number of additions to the work in 1774, too late for inclusion ( Diaries , pp. 298-299, and 263). XXXV (Jan. 1799), 9-14. A long "Account of Benjamin Kennicott, D. D." with extensive unsigned notes. This is a much fuller account than that in the DNB , including, among other matter, Kennicott's long and singular dedication of his Two Dissertations . . . to his "honoured Benefactors," among them Ralph Allen and Dr. William Oliver. XXXV (Feb. 1799), 81-83. "I send you an Original Letter which lately fell into my hands." The writer "seems to have been Chaplain to Bishop Turner, then Bishop of Ely." The letter, dated "Ely House, Feb. 7th, 1684-5," is an expression of grief at the death of Charles II. The letter was "(Directed) To the Rev. Mr. Francis Roper, Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge." An "Editor[ial]" footnote gives biographical information about Roper, including the fact that he was "collated to a prebend in the Cathedral of Ely 12th March 1685-6, and installed April 1, 1686." XXXV (April 1799), 225-229. A never-before printed account of the Roman theatre of Saguntum in Valencia, "translated from the Latin, and corrected by an eminent literary Character" was "lately found amongst the papers of a deceased friend." The letter is from "Emmanuel Martini to the Most Illustrious and Honorable Antony Felix Zondadardi, Archbishop of Damascus, and Pontifical Legate to the Catholic King." Dated "From my study, 6th Jan. 1709." XXXV (April 1799), 241-244. A fourteen-line headnote introductory to the reprinting of "the Present Communication . . . indorsed 'An intercepted Letter directed to one Linwell Chapman, in Pope's Head Alley, dated from Llanthen, the 8th of the 2nd month 1660." The letter treats of a conspiracy and is signed "Your faithful brethren and fellow-labourers in the Lord's work, Des, Presid. R. Hughes, Clarke." Livewell ( sic ) Chapman was apprehended for a seditious pamphlet in 1655. See H. Plomer, Dictionary of Printers and Booksellers . . . 1641-1667 (1907), p. 44. XXXV (April 1799), 258-260. [A busy month for Reed]. "I send you a Poem by RICHARD SAVAGE, which is so scarce as to have eluded the search of the Collector of the Works of that unfortunate genius, and by consequence does not, as it ought, form a part of that Edition, or of the English Poets by Dr. Johnson." The poem is titled "A Poem, Sacred to the Glorious Memory of our late and most gracious Sovereign Lord King George I." Clarence Tracy in his biography of Savage writes of the poem that "Savage later suppressed this poem . . . , so successfully that it did not appear in his works or any other collection" (p. 81). I do not know if it was elsewhere reprinted. XXXVIII (Dec. 1800), 417-418. "I send you two letters [of Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu], which you may be assured are genuine, as the originals are now before me." The letters, one dated solely "Saturday Night" and the other, "Sandelford, Aug. 9th, 1764," are to Dr. Messenger Monsey. "For many years he and the Earl of Bath were accounted rivals in a prolonged flirtation with Mrs. Montagu" ( DNB ). The letters are not included in the four-volume collection of letters, second edition, 1809, nor are they in Reginald Blunt's two-volume biography of Mrs. Montague (1923). XXXVIII (Dec. 1800), 423. Reed gives an account of the Hon. Mrs. Monk's poem on her husband written "on her death-bed, while at Bath," which "having been published in [Theophilus] Cibber's Lives of the Poets, and [in] Poems by Eminent Ladies, I send you transcribed from a more correct copy." The poem is at III. 203 in Cibber's Lives (1753). There are substantive differences between the two versions in thirteen of the twenty-one lines of the poem. XXXIX (Jan. and March 1801), 9-12, 191-193. "The following Notes taken by Lord Orford at Woburn Abbey are not inserted in his works. A very few copies were printed and given away, but they seem entitled to a wider circulation." Allen T. Hazen notes the EM printing of the notes but does not identify C.D. 6 XXXIX (April 1801), 247-248. "The following letter to the DUKE D'AGUILLON from SIR EDWARD HAWKE, written soon after the GLORIOUS 20th of November 1759, shows the honour and spirit of the brave English Commander in so true a light, that I am persuaded there is no British bosom but will be fired with sentiments of gratitude and patriotism on the perusal." The letter is dated from the "Royal George, Dec. 12, 1759" and can be read in Montagu Burrows's life of Admiral Hawke (1883), pp. 414-416. XL (Aug. 1801), 89-90. In a copy of the works of SIR THOMAS BROWN, printed in 1686, which formerly belonged to DR. WHITE KENNET, Bishop of Peterbrough, I find the following memorandum, in the handwriting of that Prelate. It contains circumstances not generally known." The work in question is not in the Peterborough collection in the Cambridge University Library. XLI (Jan. and Feb. 1802), 9-10, 89-90. "The correspondence I now send you is copied from the originals in the hand-writing of the two great men whose names stand at the head of this communication," i.e. Dr. Joseph Butler, Bishop of Durham, and Dr. Samuel Clarke. See The Works of Bishop Butler , ed. J. H. Bernard, 2 vols. (1900), I. 331-338; the EM is acknowledged as the place of the first printing of the letters. XLV (Feb. 1809), 98. "STRICTURES ON DR. JOHNSON'S MONUMENT IN ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL. Though not where this eminent Writer was interred, nor very early after his death, yet in St. Paul's Cathedral , and in the year 1796, an honorary monument was erected by private subscriptions; of which, after all, I fear it may be justly said, that it is of greater expense as to execution than propriety as to form. One cannot but lament that false taste (for I give it the mildest name) should have here destroyed characteristic truth, and brought even our Christian feelings into some sort of question. Not to mention his shorn head, was Dr. Johnson ever publicly seen with three bare limbs, and a fourth wrapped in a blanket? Why, then, is his image so represented? and this too in so sacred a place. And, in these commemorative tokens, why must a proof of the Sculptor's knowledge of Anatomy , the Nude , and the habiliments of other times and countries, ever be accounted a prime consideration, and one to which not only all we see daily around us of personal attire, but the ordinary forms of elegancy, must give place? Reflections of this kind might be made with regard to much of what we meet with in the other arts that imitate the human figure; and from them this useful conclusion, it is presumed, might be satisfactorily drawn, viz. that in a country of the first consequence, where learning and ingenuity are , and have been long , eminently displayed, it is needless, nay that it is palpable bigotry, in artists so violently to disregard the established forms of dress, and to follow patterns which in reality have often nothing more to recommend them than their age, their quaintness, or their capability of shewing much of the naked frame. [¶] The subject is indeed copious, but too level to ordinary thought to ask many words of explanation. And it is to be hoped, the Reverend Body authorized to decide as to the admission of these honorary memorials into this sacred edifice, will, in future, take courage to trust to their own ideas alone respecting the dress, or no dress, of its carved figures , and esteem themselves most probably far better judges (with much fewer misleading prejudices) of this kind of propriety than any board of Dilettanti or individual artist whatsover." Rarely did the soft-spoken, often monosyllabic, Reed express himself so strongly. XLVII (May 1805), 376-380. A catalogue of the pictures of the Shakespeare Gallery with prices they commanded. In his prefatory statement Reed deplored the "chilling apathy" which made the sale necessary. He concluded, "It is unnecessary to add that when any of the performances here enumerated shall hereafter change their present owners it will most probably be at a considerable advance in price." XLVII (June 1805), 419-422. "The letter I now send you has lost its cover; but I think there can be no doubt concerning the person to whom it was addressed" [i.e. the Earl of Chesterfield]. The writer was Sir Thomas Robinson, "Long" Sir Thomas (1700?-1777); the date "20th March 1756," in response to one of the "6th instant." There is no reference in Bonamy Dobrée's edition of Chesterfield's correspondence to a letter of 6 March 1756 to Sir Thomas. XLIX (June 1806), 418-419. "The following Memoranda relative to some eminent persons connected with this respectable seminary [Christ College, Cambridge], were copied many years ago from a MS . in the British Museum." L (July 1806), 26-28. Reed reprints the text of "a Court held at Stationers' Hall, On Friday, the 22d day of May, 1685," about "the licensing and entering of all books and papers for the better government of the Press." He contributed it "as it proves the arbitrary character of the last of the infatuated Stuarts [King James]" and "as it ascertains the early outrages meditated by the Crown against the liberty of the Subject." LI (Sept. 1806), 214-215. Reed corrects Richard Cumberland's statement that his play The West Indian ran twenty-eight nights without any after-piece: "I well remember (for I was present and the bill of the play, now before me, warrants the assertion,) that the first representation of the West Indian, 19th January, 1771, was followed by the performance of Bickerstaffe's Daphne and Amyntor , and at no time was the West Indian acted without an after-piece being added to it." Recourse to Reed's Diaries reveals that he was at the first performance of the play and that he saw it again on May 2 of the same year (pp. 68, 69). Two letters from Bishop Warburton to Dr. Oliver in the July 1790 EM (p. 9) owe their presence there to Reed, for Nichols states that the "two following letters [which he later quotes] to Dr. Oliver of Bath . . . are transcribed from the Originals (presented to the late Mr. Isaac Reed by Sir John Elliot, and now in the possession of James Bindley, ESQ.)" ( Lit. Anecd. V. 581-582). A correspondent signing himself G. H. contributed three letters from Tobias Smollett to Daniel Mackercher to the March 1784 EM (pp. 169-171), the longest of which is number eleven in Edward S. Noyes's edition of The Letters of Tobias Smollett (1926), p. 130. Noyes notes, "This letter was first printed in the European Magazine for March, 1784, from MS. then in the possession of Isaac Reed, the Editor. The MS. was inserted by Reed in a copy of Smollett's translation of Don Quixote , sold at auction in 1807. Its present location is unknown." This is, then, an indirect contribution by Reed. Anecdotes of William Julius Mickle in the June 1782 EM (pp. 451-452), the first volume of the periodical, is almost surely by Reed, given his relationship to Mickle and his authorship of the biographical sketch of Mickle in the Sept. and Nov. 1789 EM . 7 "Memoirs of Eyles Irwin, ESQ." appeared in March 1789 (pp. [179]-181). Irwin, a minor poet, was born in Calcutta and spent much time in the civil service in India. Reed edited both the 1775 and 1783 editions of Pearch's Collection of poems, in the latter of which he added five poems by Irwin, one of which was the first Eastern Eclogue, titled "Alexis: or, the Traveller. To Thomas Pearson, Esq." Now, Major Thomas Pearson, who also spent much time in India, dying there, was another of Reed's very good friends ( Diaries , passim ), so that one has the Reed/Pearson/Irwin connection. What is more, Irwin and his brother James subscribed, as did a Mr. Mathew Irwin, to Mickle's translation of the Lusiad , a work which Reed did much to promote. The account of Irwin in the 1812 Biographia Dramatica (I.ii.179-181) is taken verbatim, with some omissions, from the EM "Memoirs." And, to round matters off, in the Dec. 1785 EM (p. 470) there is a poem by Irwin on Hayley with Hayley's answer thereto. Poems by Irwin appeared in the October 1804 (pp. 298-299) and December 1805 (pp. 463-464) numbers of the EM . And I have no doubt whatsoever that the "Epitaph on Isaac Reed, ESQ., Late of Staple-Inn," by E. I., in the March 1807 EM , is Irwin's poetic farewell to his friend. Given the great intimacy between Reed and Pearson, it is almost impossible to believe that anybody other than Reed wrote the account of Pearson for the lead article in the April 1804 EM (p. [244]). Of particular interest is this paragraph: "In 1767 he married a sister of Eyles Irwin, Esq. well known in the poetical world, and of James Irwin, Esq., late a Director of the East India Company. This Lady unhappily died the year following, viz. 8th September 1768, and an elegant epitaph inscribed to her memory may be found, together with other poems of merit by Major Pearson, in 'Pearch's Collection of Poems, Vol. IV.'" Eight poems and "An Epitaph, on a lady who died the 8th of September, 1768, and is buried in Calcutta in Bengal" are by "T. P. Esq.," added to the 1775 edition of Pearch by its editor, Isaac Reed. In Jan. 1804 (pp. 4-5) an "Original Letter from the Late Joseph Ritson, ESQ." was reprinted. The recipient was a "Mr. R---," whom Bertrand Bronson has identified as Reed. 8 In May 1804 (p. 345) there was a quotation of "a MS. of Dr. Farmer's," and again I suspect it was Reed who tacked it on to "Bakeriana; or Biographical Extracts from Baker's MSS. Vol. XXXVI. in the Public Library at Cambridge" (pp. 343-345). On Wednesday 19 Sept. 1792 Reed, on one of his annual visits to Farmer in Cambridge, "Saw the Schools. Thence to the Library, from which I borrowed 2 Vols. of Baker's MSS." And on Thursday 8 Oct. 1795 he "copied from Baker's MSS. an accot. of Sir Christr. Hatton's institution to the Chancellorship of Oxford." 9 John Sewell, one of the original publishers of the EM , was another of Reed's friends; they, with John Ellis, friend to both and an account of whom Reed contributed to the magazine, "walked to Clapham and the neighbourhd" on 2 May 1784 and dined there. Reed and Sewell were thereafter together in company a number of times up to the time of Sewell's death in 1802 (Reed was at the funeral), Reed dining at Sewell's home, accompanying him and his sister to Clycombe, and doing various things with him. And it was Sewell who evidently sent Reed his share of the profits of the EM . When at Bath in 1796, Reed noted in his diary: "I received a parcel [of proofs, almost surely] from Mr. Sewell which employed me untill near dinner time." 10 Hence, the account of "The Late Mr. John Sewell," the lead article in July 1806 (pp. [3]-7), prefaced by a paragraph written by James Asperne, who had purchased "the entire property" of the magazine, is almost certainly by Reed, who included a first-hand account of Sewell's funeral. James Bindley, commenting upon Reed's edition of Biographia Dramatica , states that "Since its publication in 1782, Mr. R. had continually interested himself in arranging and collecting materials for an improved edition; but about two years since [1805], finding himself unequal to continue his exertions, the property of this work was transferred to Messrs. Longman and Rees; and, on Mr. Reed's strongest recommendation, the completion of it was undertaken by Mr. Stephen Jones" ( EM , 51 (Feb. 1807), 84. The revised Biographia was published in 1812. What has gone unnoted is that the accounts of plays, operas, afterpieces, etc. and playwrights in the monthly "Theatrical Journal" in the EM are the sources, often taken verbatim wholly or in part, for some 135 accounts in the 1812 Biographia Dramatica , the edition Reed was working upon up to 1805, two years before his death. Stephen Jones could, of course, have gone to the "Theatrical Journals" in the EM and used them for his sources. Indeed, since Reed died in January 1807 and the 1812 Biographia Dramatica used materials from the theatrical accounts in the EM up to December 1810, it is obvious that Jones was the later borrower. But Jones, born in 1763, was only nineteen years old in 1782 when the EM began publication. Still indentured to a printer in that year and later a corrector for the press, he could have had nothing to do with the EM in its early years, his only known connection with it coming after Reed's death. Add to this that the borrowings in the 1812 Biographia Dramatica include material from the very first number of the EM and, despite the fact that Jones or anybody else could have had recourse to the volumes of the EM at any time, one is tempted to see Reed as the borrower, or, more importantly, the actual writer of the review of plays and of the occasional biographical accounts of playwrights. In at least one instance this admits of fairly solid proof. The June 1794 EM printed a letter from Richard Farmer, dated Jan. 28, 1794, to his good friend Reed on the subject of the critic and playwright John Dennis's expulsion from College for stabbing a person. Farmer was able to show that the story was true by quoting the " Gesta Book" of Caius College (pp. 412-413). The exact same entry from the Gesta Book is quoted in the 1812 Biographia Dramatica , and while it can be argued that Jones could have borrowed this too, he would have had to pore over all the pages of the volumes of the EM rather than confining himself to the monthly Theatrical Journals. What is more, there is a biographical account of a Dr. Dowman in the book review section of EM I, parts of which, because he also wrote drama, were incorporated verbatim into the 1812 Biographia . So, too, with an account of Richard Brinsley Sheridan which was the lead article in the February 1782 EM . And so, too, with so many others. Of alternatives, i.e. Reed, while working on a revision of his 1782 edition of Biographia Drammatica wrote a number of reviews of plays and biographical accounts of playwrights which he intended to use later, or, Jones, a number of years after the inception of the EM , possibly as late as 1797, went systematically through the volumes of the EM gleaning not only extended accounts but even single phrases, which seems the likelier? Reed's knowledge of the drama, his constant attendance at the theatre as evidenced by his diaries, and his editorial experience with dramatic literature all point to him as the author of this great body of theatrical material. Reed's interest in biography is well attested by both Nichols and Bindley and is reflected in the canon of his writings. Since a goodly number of the reviews of the acted drama are of plays not listed in Reed's diaries, one may conclude that he did not write those reviews. Either he or Jones borrowed from them for the 1812 Biographia Dramatica . In the interest of space I shall list the EM articles and the 1812 Biographia Dramatica borrowings in an Appendix, noting now that verbatim borrowings are the rule rather than the exception. Those interested in pursuing any part of this material have, therefore, the necessary data. I shall comment on a few pieces of more than ordinary interest. EM 1812 Biog. Dram . VI. 174-6 G.A. Stevens I.ii.688-90 The account of Stevens in the 1782 Biographia is almost entirely different from that in the EM . Reed heard Stevens's "Lecture on Heads" at least twice ( Diaries , pp. 59, 75). Additional information on Stevens appeared in this same volume of the EM , (pp. 340, 459) but it was not used in 1812. However, a letter by Stevens, reprinted in the October 1786 EM (pp. 174-175), is appended to the sketch of his life in 1812. X. 19-21 Kenrick III.405-407 refers to and extensively quotes EM . XII. 191-3 Mysterious Mother III.65-69 A headnote in the EM states that the account of the play "appears to have been intended as an article in 'The Biographia Dramatica' ]1782u[ but when it was suppressed, and an inferior one, in every point of view, substituted in its place, we are unable to give any information." The account in the 1782 Biographia is the framework for that in 1812, the latter's borrowings being verbatim. The 1812 version gives the names of Garrick and Johnson, both of whom were alive in 1782, instead of the earlier account which names no names. The 1812 version adds further parallels to the plot. The earlier account ends, "We intended to have given the reader a specimen of it; but having learnt that the sensibility of the author (to whom every respect is due) would be wounded by such an exhibition we deem ourselves bound to suppress it, however reluctantly." The 1812 account has a paragraph introducing quotation of the first scene of the play and a final paragraph of praise, the latter taken verbatim from the EM . XIII. 58-9 F. Pilon I.i.572-574 Largely verbatim, but with some stylistic changes (revision?); for example, EM has "accordant," where 1812 has "consonant." XXI. 163-5 John Hoole I.i.363-364 Reed met Hoole in 1777; they dined at the home of Daniel Braithwaite, another of Reed's good friends, in 1802 ( Diaries , pp. 97, 229; see also pp. 130, 130-133, 135, 158, and 166). XXV. 110-115, 179-184 Dr. Paul Hifferman I.i.333 The very short account in the Biographia refers to "some very amusing anecdotes" in the EM , citing this volume and pages. The 1812 account is a slightly revised version of the 1782. XXVI. 85-86 George Colman, the elder I.i.138-139 The EM account is an avowed continuation of one in 1785 (VIII. 83-5). XXIX. 3-4 Henry James Pye I.ii.584 Some omissions, but with this addition: "His odes are such as will not bring the Laurel [he succeeded Thomas Warton as Poet Laureate] into contempt; though we fear that the repetition of the same ideas, year after year, is not calculated to add much to an author's reputation." There is no entry for Pye in Reed's Diaries . XXIX. 54-5 Days of Yore II.154 The adverse criticism in the EM , "This drama will add but little to the reputation of its author [Richard Cumberland], whose talents would be more successfully employed in comedy," is omitted in 1812. XXX. 116 Don Pedro II.170 As with his Days of Yore (above), Cumberland is again adversely but not severely criticized in the EM , but not in 1812. Reed and Cumberland were together in company a number of times ( Diaries , pp. 103, 124, 188, 192, 227, erroneously indexed as George Cumberland). In 1780 Reed could write "Cumberland is a contemptible fellow but justice is due him" ( Diaries , p. 268). The very short, one-paragraph account of Cumberland in the 1782 Biographia is very much expanded in 1812. The former's criticism, "He is a very prolific, but unequal, writer; some of his Comedies making near approaches towards excellence, while others of his works, as may be presumed from the hasty composition of them [compare "too hastily composed" of the Don Pedro review], are by no means calculated to support the reputation he has acquired" (I. 106). Note the similarity of those last words to those in the review of Days of Yore (quoted above). All this would seem to support the attribution of these EM pieces to Reed. XXX. 352 The Conspiracy II.122 The adverse criticism in the EM of Robert Jephson's play is omitted in 1812. Indeed, the very brief, one-paragraph, account of Jephson in 1782 is very much expanded in 1812, the latter version being very laudatory. Reed and Jephson first coincided in company in 1788 and twice two years later, each time at Edmond Malone's lodgings ( Diaries , pp. 158, 177, 181). Malone accused George Steevens, Reed's very good friend, of criticizing Jephson's Law of Lombardy because Jephson was a friend of his. 11 XXXII. 20 George Keate I.ii.419 The account in the Biographia is very much shorter than that in EM . Reed and Keate were in the same company on a number of occasions ( Diaries , pp. 125, 136, 152-3, 166). XXXII. 410 False Impressions II. 220 EM has "The play has most of the faults of this author's [Cumberland's] performances, and some of his merits. It is not however calculated (though it has been very successful) to increase the reputation of the author of the West Indian ," which is omitted in 1812. Compare the words I have italicized with the remarks on the review of Don Pedro (above, XXX. 116). XXXIV. 75-76 John Philip Kemble I.ii.422-427 Kemble was another of Reed's friends (see the index to Diaries ). XXXIV. 113 Cambro-Britons , by James Boaden II.78 Reed dined in Boaden's company but once, in 1801 ( Diaries , p. 226). XXXIV. 400 A Word for Nature III.422 EM comments on Cumberland's "haste" and suggests that "The produce of haste and carelessness are not calculated [my italics] to obtain lasting applause." Compare XXX. 116 and XXXII. 410. XLI. 125 The Cabinet II.75 The account in the EM covers four columns; that in 1812, only some thirty words. They coincide only in "possesses [possession of] irresistible attractions." Reed or Jones? Who would pick out three words among so many others? XLIV. 9-11 Richard Rolt I.ii.605-606 An anonymous correspondent wrote to the EM from Dublin in June 1803 to defend Rolt against "the injurious account" with which his memory "is degraded in the Biographia Dramatica 1782, 2 vols. 8 vo. and by Boswell in his Life of Johnson." Since there is no account of Rolt in David Erskine Baker's Companion to the Play-House , 2 vols., 1764, the predecessor to the 1782 Biographia , the 1782 account must be Reed's. Query: Did he write the EM account, or did he simply incorporate it into the 1812 Biographia ? L. 397 The Vindictive Man , by Thomas Holcroft III.381-382 Partly verbatim, but with the adverse criticism omitted or softened. Reed was never in Holcroft's company. In addition to his own contributions, those demonstrably his and those conjecturally his, Reed was instrumental in soliciting contributions from friends and acquaintances. One learns from a biographical sketch of William Seward in the EM , almost surely by Reed although unsigned, that Seward "first amused himself with collecting the materials for what he called DROSSIANA in the present Magazine, which he began in October 1789, and continued without intermission to the end of his life" (Oct. 1799, p. 219). By the time of his death Seward had contributed 118 Drossianas, a not inconsiderable body of material, some of which went into a collection he entitled Biographiana , for which Reed wrote a biographical sketch of his dear friend Richard Farmer. On Tuesday, the eleventh of December 1781, Reed dined at the home of his friend Daniel Braithwaite; also present was Seward. Thereafter the two were together in company in May 1783, January 1786, December 1786, March 1792; in October 1793 Seward joined Reed at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and the following year Reed visited Seward in a house the latter had rented at Bemerton near Salisbury and stayed with him for a week ( Diaries, passim ). So, too, was it with William Julius Mickle, as can be seen from Reed's letters to him now in the James M. Osborn Collection in New Haven. In addition to a series of essays he called "Fragments by Leo," thirteen in number, appearing from May 1785 through June, 1788, Mickle also wrote a number of reviews for the EM . 12 Reed's closest friends were Richard Farmer and George Steevens, and it should come as no surprise that Steevens should contribute some original material to the EM and that some of his pieces that had appeared elsewhere should be reprinted in the EM . A certain "Philo-Johnson" wrote some devastating criticism of Sir John Hawkins's Life of Johnson for the April and May, 1787 EM (pp. 223-227, 310-313), continued in the October number (pp. 262-264). Bertram Davis has attributed these to Steevens with some confidence, 13 but what he failed to notice and what reinforces his attribution is that immediately following the first installment of Philo-Johnson's blast is a letter signed "Curio" (p. 227) in which the writer sarcastically makes much of the fact that Hawkins, as editor of Johnson's Works , silently removed the last paragraph of the Preface to Shakespeare (the 1773 revised edition) with its great praise of Steevens's part in the revision. And Curio-Steevens then goes on to show that despite Hawkins's claim to have printed the 1765 Preface, which, of course, does not have the paragraph in question, the text of the Preface used is not that of 1765. What is more, and again this, while unnoted by Davis, helps further to strengthen his Philo-Johnson attribution, the Curio letter is immediately followed (pp. 227-229) by unsigned animadversions on "the late Mr. Whateley's Remarks on some of the Characters of Shakespeare " in its comparison of Richard III and Macbeth. These are by Steevens. 14 Also by Steevens is the important "Account of the Writings of Dr. Samuel Johnson," appearing between Dec. 1784 and April 1785 (VI. 411-413; VII. 9-12, 81-84, 190-192, 249-250) in which he may have been helped by Reed, according to Marshall Waingrow. 15 Steevens also contributed anecdotes of Johnson under the title Johnsoniana in January 1785 (pp. 51-55). And his, too, are the account of, and proposals for, the reproduction of the "only genuine portrait of Shakespeare," i.e. the so-called Felton portrait, in the possession of the printseller William Richardson, in the October 1794 EM (pp. 277-281), followed in the next month (pp. 316-317) by a letter signed with his initials in "Vindication of a Passage in the Advertisement Prefixed to the Last Edition of Shakespeare," i.e. his 1793 edition. 16 The March 1790 EM has a print of Marmor Hardicnutianum facing page 177, with pages 177-182 devoted to remarks on this remarkable archaeological find from various persons, some also offering translations of the Anglo-Saxon verses inscribed thereon. The whole thing is Steevens's most famous hoax, the details of which can be read in the DNB or more fully in Nichols's Literary Illustrations (V. 430-432). 17 In Sept. 1790 Steevens's "Reasons why it is impossible that the Coffin lately dug up in the Parish Church of St. Giles, Cripplegate, should contain the Reliques of MILTON" appeared. 18 Others of his contributions may be relegated to a footnote. 19 And I suppose Reed saw to it that the Epitaph on Steevens by William Hayley was printed in the December 1801 EM (p. 407). Richard Farmer, in response to a query from Reed about the critic John Dennis, wrote a letter dated Jan. 28, 1794, which appeared in the June 1794 EM (pp. 412-413). In the May 1791 EM (pp. 415-416) Reed, writing as C. D., printed Farmer's "Directions for the Study of English History," prefacing the piece with the statement that the Directions were "written many years ago to a Friend by a Gentleman of great eminence yet living, whose name at present cannot be disclosed." 20 John Hoole, translator of Tasso and Ariosto, was another of Reed's friends—and of Dr. Johnson's. Hoole's "Narrative of What Passed in the Visits Paid by J. Hoole to Dr. Johnson, in his Last Illness, Three Weeks before his Death" appeared in the Sept. 1799 EM (pp. 153-158), almost fifteen years after the events related. The following month (pp. 225-227) Hoole, signing himself "J. H." in a footnote, contributed a piece entitled "Mrs. Anna Williams. The following Account of this Lady is copied from a Paper transmitted by Lady K[night], at Rome, to a Gentleman of great literary eminence [Hoole himself], and written by her Ladyship." 21 Dr. Charles Burney, another of Reed's friends, was the subject of a biographical sketch in the March 1785 EM (pp. [163]-64) which Roger Lonsdale declares "was undoubtedly authorized, if not written, by C. B. himself." 22 Reed almost surely solicited this. And as the possessor of much manuscript material of his deceased friend John Ellis, it was again, almost surely, Reed who caused to be printed in the March 1792 EM (p. 167) a letter from "Mr. [Nicholas] Fayting to Mr. Ellis" with an accompanying poem by Fayting's friend Mr. Taylor, also of St. John's College, Cambridge, later to be known as "Demosthenes" Taylor.</field>

These reviews are overlooked in Sister M. Eustace Taylor, William Julius Mickle (1734-1788), A Critical Study (Washington, D.C., 1937).

      <field name="heading_text">Additions to the Nichols File of the Gentleman's Magazine by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The history of the Gentleman's Magazine from its inception in 1731 to the death in 1754 of Edward Cave, its founder, has been chronicled by C. Lennart Carlson and more recently by Albert Pailler. 1 Both works are indebted to John Nichols's Rise and Progress of the Gentleman's Magazine . . . Being a Prefatory Introduction to the General Index to that Work, from 1787 to 1818 , published in 1821 in the third volume of the General Index. There Nichols gives the early history of Cave and his associates, naming a number of the contributors to the GM , among others Samuel Johnson, John Hawkesworth, John Duncombe, Richard Gough, and William Beloe, and appending a list of names of later contributors which covers some ten columns (pp. lxxiv-lxxviii). His head note to this list reads, "In the preceding pages the names have been enumerated of some of the earliest Correspondents of the Magazine; and it is with equal pride and pleasure that the following List is subjoined of Contributors of a later date, formed principally from a memoriter recollection of departed Friends and Patrons—and which might be considerably enlarged, were the pages of the different Volumes turned over for that particular purpose." Most recently Professor James Kuist's invaluable work, The Nichols File of "The Gentleman's Magazine." Attribution of Authorship and Other Documentation in Editorial Papers at the Folger Library (1982) (hereafter Kuist), has made possible the identification of the authors of some 13,000 anonymous and pseudonymous pieces. What I propose to do is to give the authority or authorities for some of these attributions and to add other pieces by certain of these writers, pieces not marked in the Nichols File. I divide the writers into two categories, those in Nichols's list in his Rise and Progress of the GM and those not in that list. Names with an asterisk prefixed do not appear in Kuist, hence any contributions by these writers are to be added to Kuist. It will be understood that the omissions occur because the Nichols file does not include them. A third category contains the names of those contributors who are not in Nichols's list nor in Kuist. A single corroboratory entry beside each name in all three categories, unless otherwise stated, is to the GM , i.e. Brown, James N.S. 11 (1839), 322 means that the indicated reference to the GM is authority for identifying Brown as a contributor. More than one entry means the items are contributions, not authorities. In this example Brown is in Kuist; in other instances, the writer may not be, and all contributions identified in the authority will be given. So, too, with possible additions to the contributions of writers in Kuist or in the Nichols File. Additions to the contributions of John Nichols, some one hundred and twenty, are listed separately. Nichols's Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century , 9 vols. (1812-15) and his Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century , 8 vols. (1817-58) will appear as Lit.A and Illustr . Pailler (see note 1) estimates that there were between 600 and 700 correspondents to the GM in the years 1731-54 and that of them only some forty contributed two or more pieces (p. 349). In an appendix (pp. 660-665) he lists 183 named contributors in this period with the number of their contributions; only four of these correspondents had more than ten pieces printed, while only eight others had more than five. And only forty-eight of the entire number had more than one piece accepted. In another table (pp. 666-668) Pailler lists ninety-five pseudonymous correspondents and the number of their contributions; only one had more than ten pieces printed, and even that figure is suspect, as Pailler earlier points out, since the initials "A.B." may cover the identity of a number of correspondents. These statistics should be borne in mind in what follows, even though I treat of a later period. In all my lists there are men whose contributions are such as to demand separate treatment. The contributions of some men have been examined in separate studies and will not be treated here, unless something new can be added. In the following lists I generally give only the first page of a contribution, unless there is a possibility of confusion in identifying it. My somewhat desultory study of the GM extends through the two volumes for 1800, although in a few instances I have gone beyond that date. Not in Nichols's List Ellis, Sir Henry Richard Garnett, in DNB sub Mulcaster, Richard, attributes three letters (by E.H.) on Mulcaster (1800. i. 419, 511 and ii. 603) to him. Add to Kuist. Haxman, Mr. Add to Kuist. 1792. 797-8 (Ignotus). Lofft, Capel I attribute 1792. ii. 789 (C.L.), on Milton, to him. Park, Thomas Add 1793. i. 391-2, 496, 516-7, 536; ii. 904, 904-6, 985, 1166; 1794. i. 121, 513; ii. 617; 1795. ii. 902; 1796. i. 197, 399; 1797. ii. 641, 737, 751, 781 (a poem); 1798. i. 277; ii. 688, 933; 1799. i. 191, 385; 1800. i. 29. There is plenty of internal evidence that these are by Park. Four accompany drawings (and Park was an engraver). 1795. ii. 902 is by a friend of the poet Cowper, and Park was that. 1793. ii. 905 is on Dr. William Walley, and the poem of 1797. ii. 781 was written "in Dr. Walley's study." 1798. ii. 933 is on the poet Robert Southwell who also appears in 1800. i. 29. There are eight editions of Southwell's poems in Bibliotheca anglo-poetica . . . (1815); the collection is mainly from Park's library. There are other links. All are signed T.P. Note that 1786. i. 134-6, 377-8 are tentatively attributed to the Rev. John Spicer in the Nichols File (Kuist, p. 145). Weston, Rev. Stephen I attribute two poems and two articles, all signed S.W., to him: 1792. i. 464, 560; 1793. ii. 1165 and 1794. i. 206, the last two linked by subject matter although there is some ambiguity about the signature to the last, S.W. also standing for South West. Add also 1790. i. 219. In Nichols's List Aiken, James Lit. A. 9. 384 n. Andrews, James Petitt 1797. ii. 797. Ashby, Rev. George E. H. Meyerstein, A Life of Thomas Chatterton (1930), p. 463 attributes 1777. 205-08, an attack on the genuineness of the poems, to him. *Barker, Thomas 1754. 58-9; 1783. ii. 655 (T.B.) are his. *Barrett, Rev. Stephen Lit. A. 9. 672. Berkelely, Mrs. Eliza 1800. ii. 1115. Bickerstaffe, Rev. William 1789. i. 182. Bowle, John 1788. ii. 1029 states he contributed "under various signatures." Joseph Baretti, Tolondron (1786), attributes attacks on him in 1785. ii. 497-8 (Querist), 608 (Anti-Janus), 675 (X.Y.), and 760 (J.C.) to Bowle. See also Lit. A. 6. 183. Add the above to Kuist. J.B. (not James Boswell) in 1790. ii 1127 says Querist letter was not by Bowle. Brooke, John Charles 1794. i. 187. Brown, James N.S. 11 (1839), 323. Brydges, Sir Samuel Egerton Lit. A. 8. 560. Add to Kuist: 1788. ii. 698; 1792. i. 522; 1793. i. 211; 1797. ii. 731. *Burton, E. 1783. i. 37, 301, 313; ii. 547, 758, 942; 1784. i. 16, 168. *Chalmers, James Lit. A. 3. 691. *Christie, James, the younger Nichols's list was published in 1821. The only entry for Christie in Kuist is for 1823. Hence he must have contributed before 1821. James Christie, the elder, does not seem to have written anything. Christie, Thomas Illustr. 5. 605 attributes 1785. ii. 687-8 (T.C.) to him. Cole, William Lit. A. 1. 661 attributes five pieces in 1779 (an error for 1777): 119 (Paleophilus), 130 (a laudatory anonymous review of Cole's own travel book and hence almost surely not by him), 157-8 (W.C. of Milton near Cambridge), 208 (X.X.), and 219-21 (signed). Add numbers 1, 3 and 4 to Kuist. Cowper, William Kenneth Povey in Review of English Studies , 8 (1932), 317 attributes 1790. ii. 801 (Indagator) to him. Norma Russell, A Bibliography of William Cowper (1963), p. 137 says he is Alethes of 1785. ii. 610-13 on Pope's Homer . Dalrymple, Sir David, Lord Hailes 1792. ii. 1154. Add to Kuist 1791. i. 399 and ii. 885-7. Denne, Rev. Samuel 1799. ii. 723 and Lit. A. 3. 531 attribute 1771. 18 (W.D.) to him. Add to Kuist. Duncombe, John 1788. ii. 692 n. attributes 1781. 77 and 332-3 to him. Nichols, Preface to the GM index for 1787-1818, p. lviii. says he wrote the Preface to the 1780 GM. Add to Kuist. *Fenn, Sir John 1794. i. 190 attributes 1784. ii. 644-9 (by N.) to him. Goodenough, Dr. Samuel Illustr. 6. 255-6. He claims 1794. i. 579-80. Graves, Rev. Richard See Charles Jarvis Hill, The Literary Career of Richard Graves, The Author of "The Spiritual Quixote" (Northampton, Mass. n.d.), pp. 102-03 for attribution of two poems "On a favourite little Cur" 1740. 460 and "To Chloe; on her Fondness for the Enigmatists" 1741. 160 to Graves. Greene, Edward Burnaby 1788. i. 276. Gordon Goodwin writes in the DNB that Greene contributed occasionally to the GM and singles out a poem, "Pastoral," 1757. 326 as noteworthy. Add to Kuist. Goodwin is mistaken in attributing 1738. 357 and 1740. 50 to him. Headley, Rev. Henry I attribute remarks on Thomas Gray (C.T.) in 1788. i. 22 to him. His usual signature is C.T.O.

See also Carlson, First Magazine , p. 18. Chandler, Dr. Richard R. Holt-White, The Life and Letters of Gilbert White (1901), II. 105 states the "Remarkable Register" of 1783. ii. 579 is his. Collett, John Alumni Cantabrigienses, 1752-1900, sub Collett, is authority for his authorship of the poem signed J. C-ll-t in 1757. 521. Duck, Stephen 1856 (vol. 201), 274 n. gives the poem "Imitation" in 1738. 429 by S-n D-k to him. Duncan, Rev. John 1783. ii. 959 n. attributes several poems written "near forty-six years ago," singling one out "in vol. VII. p. 376" on "Small-Beer." Duncan is not named, but the note is appended to the fourth installment of "Horace, Ep. II. B. I. Modernised By Dr. D--n, of S. W--rm [read "n"] b--r--gh, as a moral Lesson for his Son at Winchester School," the previous three occurring at p. 606 and at pp. 430 and 494 of 1783. i. Since St. John's College, Oxford had the advowson of the living at South War n borough, I was able to dig Duncan out of Alumni Oxonienses . Two sons, John Shute and Philip Bury, were keepers of the Ashmolean Museum, Philip succeeding his brother. Three other poems attributed to Duncan are not traceable through the very incomplete and often inaccurate 1731-1787 index to the GM . Duncombe, Lewis 1795. ii. 806 attributes an epigram in 1795. ii. 773 to him. See also 1795. ii. 893 where Edward Pearson attributes it to "Mr. Duncombe, of Canterbury." Elderton, Joseph 1796. i. 445, "frequently an entertaining correspondent in our Miscellany" (i.e. the GM ). Fawkes, Francis I attribute the "Epitaph on John Hawkesworth, L.L.D." signed F.F. in 1773. 614. Hakewill, James 1799. i. 79 notes he was many years a contributor to GM , "for which he had but a few days before his death prepared the brief note which is printed in p. 72." There is no note on p. 72, nor can I discover one in this January number. Hall, Westley I attribute two poems, 1753. 45, one signed West. Hall, and the other, W.H., both having to do with the King of Prussia, to him. H arrison, M atthew M.H.F.S.A. in GM . 1795. ii. 366 is almost surely he, a F ellow of the So ciety of An tiquaries, the only M.H. in the list of Fellows up to 1796. See also 1790. i. 306 on Samuel Johnson's Shakespeare . Harte, Walter Joseph Cockfield in Illustr. 5.791 attributes a poem on Lord Chesterfield in 1769. 38 to him. Hylton, John Scott 1793. ii. 767-8 attributes 1791. ii. 1097-8 and 1792. i. 557-8 to him. He is also J.S.H. of 1809. i. 198-9, the latter a posthumously published poem submitted by Δ.π, i.e. David Parkes. Jackson, Samuel 1856 (vol. 201) 271 n. attributes the translation of Samuel Johnson's "Ad Urbanum" on the verso of the title-page of 1786. ii. to him. Lindsay, John 1789. i. 178 attributes "papers on water-spouts and several other pieces." See 1781. 559; 1783. ii. 1025; 1785. ii. 594 for the water-spout papers (signed). Morrell, Thomas 1784. i. 154 calls him one of the earliest contributors to the GM ; the DNB states he contributed essays and verses. Lit. A. 1. 652 attributes the Latin poem on Ashton, signed Morellus, in 1770. 153 (read 183) to him. Pag et , Richar d 1794. ii. 1157 states he contributed as D.T. until those initials were usurped in the 1790 Supplement; thereafter he signed R.P. in black letter. See 1795. i. 99-100, 382-3 on him, and 1794. ii. 607, 701-03, 703-04 for contributions by him in but one volume of the GM . Parkes, James 1828. i. 376, "He was . . . an occasional contributor to Mr. Urban's pages," listing "views" at 1812. i. 9; 1814. i. 217; and 1816. ii. 209. Whoever marked the first of these as by his father, David Parkes (Kuist, p. 134), suffered a lapse of memory. Richardson, Richard 1857 (vol. 202) 289 n. attributes 1747. 322-4, signed R.R., to him. See R. Richardson on the same subject in 1750. 536. Rowe, Elizabeth Kuist, in Studies in Bibliography (1976), p. 313, n. 23, lists a poem by Mrs. Rowe in 1769. 503 but not in The Nichols File .

I can only say by way of conclusion that any scholar interested in proving any aspect of the problems presented by the anonymous and pseudonymous contributions to the GM must base himself on Kuist's work and then turn over the pages of the periodical for himself. The various members of the Nichols family, it has been seen, were neither infallible nor exhaustive in their attributions. And from my list of contributors whose names and/or pseudonyms are neither in Nichols's list nor in the Nichols File, it is equally obvious that much work remains to be done in adding to that list. I have termed my study "desultory," and it is precisely that, especially in the area of identifying new contributors, for I have not been a diligent reader of the obituary notices in the GM , nor have I scanned all the pages of the seventeen volumes of Nichols's two great compendia of eighteenth-century literature, the most important sources for such identifications. Much, then, remains to be done.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Sons and Lovers Manuscript by Wayne Templeton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1922, Mabel Dodge Luhan, having read Sea and Sardinia , and wishing to meet the author, implored the Lawrences for some time to visit her in Taos, New Mexico. When they finally arrived, they discovered in the sparsely populated desert a freedom from societal pressure and a simplicity which attracted them. Returning in March, 1924 after a year in Mexico and Europe, they decided to stay, if Mabel would sell them her Flying Heart Ranch. She wished to give it to them but Frieda, not wanting to accept favours from this woman, wrote to her sister Else in Germany for the manuscript of Sons and Lovers which Lawrence had stored there some years previously. This was presented as full payment for the ranch. Mabel, not particularly thrilled by what she saw as a stack of partially illegible pages of a novel she had never read, and embittered by Frieda's antagonism, in turn presented the manuscript to her New York analyst, Dr. Abraham Arden Brill, as partial payment for services rendered. When he died in 1948 his son, Dr. Edmund R. Brill, inherited the treasure. Although this was apparently known to scholars, or certainly easily discovered, nearly fifteen years were to pass before anyone expressed interest in acquiring the manuscript. Finally, in 1963, after a series of negotiations, Mark Schorer purchased it for the University of California: Berkeley. The secretive manuscript was not yet available for scholarly analysis, however; another thirteen years passed before the permission necessary for publication was granted. In 1976, 63 years after its completion, the manuscript of Sons and Lovers was accessible. A new era of literary criticism involving this, the first truly successful of Lawrence's novels, had begun. Lawrence conceived the novel in 1910. He mentioned in a letter to Sydney S. Pawling, 18 October, 1910, 1 that "Paul Morel [as it was then titled] will be a novel—not a florid prose poem, or a decorated idyll running to seed in realism, but a restrained, somewhat impersonal novel. It interests me very much. I wish I were not so agitated just now, and could do more." In this statement we see how subjective Lawrence was, and how transilient authorial intent can become. The novel is anything but impersonal; for the next two and a half years, until its publication as Sons and Lovers , Lawrence agonized over the manuscript. On 14 March, 1911 he wrote Helen Corke, "I have begun 'Paul Morel' again" (p. 239). Later that year he told Louie Burrows "I have just done one folio, a dozen MSS pages, of Paul Morel. That great, terrible but unwritten novel, I am afraid it will die a mere conception" (p. 258). In 1912 he finally completed a tentative draft and sent it to Jessie Chambers. On her recommendation he began the novel for the third time, and by that I do not mean revision; in the Lawrencean manner he disposed of each rejected manuscript and started completely anew. None of these earlier drafts are extant. On 3 April, 1912 he informed Edward Garnett that "I shall finish my Colliery novel this week—the first draft. It'll want a bit of revising. It's by far the best thing I've done" (p. 381). But the revision was not easy. The novel "remains on my conscience" (p. 399), he told Frieda, and he revised with the "patience of a saint" (p. 405), but to little avail. "You don't think the quality of my work is going down, do you?" he asked Garnett (p. 439). He finished, and on 2 June, 1912 sent the revised manuscript to William Heinemann, who rejected it. Garnett, who was an editor for Gerald Duckworth, then read it and although he disliked the work, as a favour he suggested a rather lengthy list of advisable further revisions. Lawrence again reviewed his intentions concerning the novel, and again discarded the draft at hand. Having gained considerable objectivity—from Jessie Chambers, Garnett, and to a significant degree, Frieda, who was instrumental in his escape from the stranglehold of his relationship with his mother—he began a fourth draft. This time even the name was changed, to Sons and Lovers , and the writing finally proceeded smoothly. By the end of October Lawrence had "written 400 pages . . . [and] made the book heaps better—a million times" (p. 466). By the end of the year the novel was rewritten, completely revised, and by 3 March, 1913 the galley sheets had also been proofread and revised. The novel was published 29 May, 1913 by Duckworth, and received critical acclaim. The manuscript itself is remarkably neat, the handwriting legible. Even words deleted (always by a single horizontal line) remain decipherable, as do emendations added between the lines in a smaller hand, sometimes with a finer nib. The only eccentricity of handwriting was Lawrence's tendency to leave "t's" uncrossed; such was his degree of neatness, however, that they were written without loops, so that they are never confused with "l's." Concomitant to this, the punctuation is conventional, and complete. The only calligraphic variation found throughout the manuscript, then, is the change in Lawrence's hand according to the control he was apparently exercising over the narrative generally. As he wrote, he revised in a simple, straightforward manner, usually in an attempt to overcome indecisiveness ("six rows of miner's dwellings" was changed to "six blocks"; "fished" to "pulled"; "Sheerness" to "Clathham" to "Sheerness"), or to straighten tangential curves in the narrative. The handwriting, as he pondered, uncertain as to the direction and complexity of character and plot, is small, careful, and the emendations frequent and often lengthy. As he progressed, becoming more sure of himself, the hand broadened: the words are larger, the style freer, the revisions less frequent, and involving words rather than lines or paragraphs. The pages begin to look cleaner. When he finished the final draft, Lawrence began revising in a different way, deleting lines in terms of the overall narrative, using his knowledge of what the characters and plot had become to change inconsistencies. In that process he deleted about 2,000 words. After completing his revisions, Lawrence sent the manuscript to Garnett, who deleted a further 15,000 words, using marginal parentheses and the letter "G" to indicate extent and source. This has been confirmed by his son David, who saw the manuscript and who was familiar with his father's handwriting and editing style. In the last step, Lawrence (and perhaps Garnett and Duckworth as well) revised the galley sheets: these I am calling "other emendations." By chapter, the variants are as follows: Ms: DHL Ms: (longer emendations) Ms: Other Chapter DHL Garnett emendations 1 138 21 11 16 2 73 11 9 19 3 32 -- 10 7 4 38 3 1 15 5 55 3 10 14 6 82 6 7 27 7 58 7 8 41 8 54 13 4 34 9 99 15 9 37 10 80 14 3 59 11 41 9 1 39 12 50 10 1 46 13 17 2 -- 49 14 12 5 -- 26 15 25 3 -- 16 These figures do not reveal everything, of course; each item represents variants as words, phrases, sentences, or in some cases even paragraphs, and in the case of Garnett's deletions, pages, rather than individual words. However, in a general analysis they are revealing. Lawrence's revisions, for example, tend to be shorter in the latter part of the manuscript: increasingly they become a matter of single words. Lawrence's revisions in the manuscript differ from Garnett's in that they were attempts to refine the prose, whereas Garnett was concerned with condensing the narrative. Generally, Lawrence scrutinized his writing to delete repetitive or stylistically unsophisticated words, clichés, excessive adjectives, and so on. He had a tendency, for example, to use "ignominy" or "ignominious" and "nuisance" very often (the latter is particularly evident as a description by Mrs. Morel of her husband), and to use adjectives ending in "ingly": "scatteringly," "laughingly," "resoundingly." Most of these were expunged or emended. He deleted other adjectives and adverbs as well, for reasons not immediately apparent, and effects not always successful. The first word in the phrase "small coal mines" was crossed out, for example; "great earth" was similarly changed to "earth," "beautiful clothes" to "clothes" "furiously angry" to "angry" "vulgar haste" to "haste" "he said laughing" to "laughing" "fingered wistfully" to "fingered" "pretty young witch" to "young witch" "winced violently" to "winced" "musty smelling alley" to "alley" "miserable feeling" to "feeling" "brakeless bicycle" to "bicycle" "shook playfully" to "shook" "wild blue seagrass" to "seagrass" "firm well-sprung body" to "body" "fleshy petals" to "petals" Some of these, notably those in the first column, are worthwhile deletions. "Furiously," for example, tends to be redundant; "pretty" can be construed as inappropriate; "violently" deemed needlessly synonymous. In the second column, however, we see revisions which are not effectual. By removing "musty smelling," we have only a commonplace alley. Similarly, a safe, nondescript bicycle, mere seagrass, an indifferent body, immemorable petals are all that remain. In other word revisions we are left with a correspondent dissatisfaction. Again, compare the first column with the second: "talked" was changed to "gossiped" "stood" to "crouched" "did not know" to "scarcely knew" "cattle were turned in" to "cattle turned onto the eddish" "submerged" to "slurred over" "very refined" to "rather proud" "new as red money" to "bright as copper and gold" "discussion" to "argument" "half a dozen steps" to "a little wooden flight of steps" "room" to "cellar" "looked" to "shone" "whimpered" to "whispered" "hate" to "warmth of fury" "coldness" to "chill fingertips" "thoroughly" to "nicely" "walked" to "went" "clambered" to "went" "fished" to "pulled" "barm" to "grocer" to "tradesman" "wonderfully" to "very" "passionately" to "absorbedly" "flashed and struck" to "hit" "hopped" to "ran" "paralyzed" to "helpless" "toddle" to "walk" The emendations in the first list are effective; some are exceptional: "chill fingertips," "warmth of fury," and "whispered," which has changed the entire ending of the novel, spawning, in its wake, a spate of critical argument. But in the second column the changes are not impressive; they are in fact rather pedestrian. How, for example, is "nicely" an improvement over "thoroughly," or "went" over "walked," or "clambered"? I realize that simplicity, even starkness, in prose can occasionally enhance the writing, but in this case, coming as they do from a man whose style is so dependent upon, and acclaimed for, precision in detail, I find many of these revisions disconcertedly haphazard. As puzzling are Lawrence's prolific manuscript deletions of qualifying adjectival and adverbial phrases: "from her father in contempt" reduced to "from her father" "she said to herself" to "she said" "she replied, very cold and distant" to "she replied" "sat quietly, mocking" to "sat quietly" "bitter with contempt" to "bitter" "shouted Morel, jumping at once from his chair" to "shouted Morel" "said the miner, crying unconsciously" to "said the miner" "said Paul, with hearty satisfaction" to "said Paul" Are these deletions justifiable? Certainly they were not performed for want of space, nor because the words were redundant ampliations of character, action or even motive. On the other hand, had they remained, they would have added, in the briefest of sketches, valuable insight into character and dramatic action. Lawrence was more successful in his deletion of clichés and similarly unsatisfactory phrases, such as: "rolled with laughter," "in a cold fury," "embraced in an atmosphere of hate and rage," "make a man of him," "dead silence," "jaws of death," and "cut off your nose to spite your face." But even here he proved to be an uneven editor. In one place he deleted "sink through the floor," but in another he emended the phrase "he wondered at his mother's hardness" to read "he wanted to sink through the floor." And in another passage he added a pretentious and inappropriate phrase, changing "said the landlady with subtle sarcasm" to "the landlady looked at him de haut en bas ." Lawrence used dialect extensively in his "colliery novel," and in contrast with other kinds of revisions he was unusually careful in emending passages of dialogue so as to convey verisimilitude and appropriateness of character. For example, Morel's outraged statement "'You don't mean it!'" was changed to "'Tha niver says!'" not only because the latter is clearly the Nottinghamshire vernacular, but because Morel, an uneducated coal miner, never speaks out of dialect (as does, say, Mellors, in Lady Chatterley's Lover ). Similarly, Mrs. Radford's "'A house wi' nothing but women in it's always three parts'" apparently seemed, even before the sentence was complete, to contain a metaphor unlikely to be coming from her, and was changed to "'A house o' women is as dead as a house wi' no fire.'" And when Baxter Dawes accosts Paul at one point, his threat was changed from "'I'll break every bone in your body'" to "'I'll settle your hash for a bit, yer measly little sniveller.'" Even if the emended phrase is less comprehensible, verisimilitude reigns, as when "'say another word'" became "'Ha'e much more o' thy chelp.'" In the earlier part of Sons and Lovers , Lawrence was indecisive with proper nouns, as he strove to make the novel less autobiographical, and in some cases as he simply endeavored to create more appropriate names. Thus "Bardgate" became "Carston," "Sheerness" was changed to "Chatham," then "Southampton," then "Sheerness" again, "Croyton" to "Norwood," "Beach" to "Bottoms," and "Walker Street" to "Scargill Street." "Elizabeth" became "Gertrude," "Pembleton" was changed to "Pappleworth," "James" to "Edgar," and "Frances Radford" to "Clara Dawes." In one place he made a significant error, referring to "Miriam" as "Jessie," the acknowledged source of the character. The mistake was discovered in the manuscript revision. In other emendations, apparently to keep the novel and its characters consistent—that is, to avoid tangential or otherwise inappropriate material, such as aspects of character he wished to suppress or reveal later—"the two children were highly excited because" became "the two children were highly excited" (the next sentence then focuses on William alone); the second sentence was deleted in "He laughed rather boisterously. She found him very piquant taking"; and in the following passage everything after the first sentence was crossed out: "She pitied him. She really hated men, was born to despise and hate them for the temporal authority they possess. It was not in her to be a mate to any man." The woman is Clara, initially introduced as a radical suffragette, disdainful, cold, not at all likely to see Paul as a prospective lover. She softens, however, in the revised form, and is soon Miriam's replacement. In the longer passages which Lawrence revised in the manuscript, it would seem that he spent more time working out what the weaknesses of the writing were, and how changes could be accomplished. The results, as the following reveals, tend to be competent and consistent with his intentions as we know them. In the first example: She had his soul in charge. Like a sheep dog, she tried to keep him from straying. She barked in front of him, she fought with him. In two words, she turned the point of his own petty meanness back into himself. He could not endure moral suffering: it drove him mad. became: She fought to make him undertake his own responsibilities, to make him fulfill his obligations. But he was too different from her. His nature was purely sensuous, and she strove to make him moral, religious. She tried to force him to face things. He could not endure it—it drove him out of his mind. (Chapter I) Not only did Lawrence eliminate a rather immature metaphor—carried to a ridiculous extreme: the staid Mrs. Morel barking—but the ensuing description of both characters in conflict is, in the revision, far more detailed and graphic. In another passage, "One reaches out to God" was expanded (unusual for Lawrence) to read "the small frets vanish, and the beauty of things stand out, and she had the peace and the strength to see herself," and in a third, again emending from generality to specificity: "but she was afraid of herself when it came to simple common living, and happiness: there she felt wanting, or at least, there she deeply mistrusted herself" became "in renunciation she was strong, for she did not trust herself to support every day life. She was prepared for the big things, and the deep things, like tragedy. It was the sufficiency of the small day-life she could not trust" (IX). As with revisions, Lawrence's longer deletions, although very rare, are also more consistently successful. They sharpen the narrative, and intensify the drama through the elimination of redundant or heavy-handed or sometimes sentimental prose. In the following, a representative example, all but the last sentence was deleted. No man can live unless his life is rooted in some woman; unless some woman believes in him and so fixes his belief in himself. Otherwise he is like a water plant, whose root is detached: floating still, and apparently flourishing upon a river of life, but really decaying slowly. Morel decayed slowly. It was a great tragedy, and it is the tragedy of many a man and woman. The pity was, she was too much his opposite. (I) Except for the third sentence—a wonderfully concise yet vivid summary of Morel—we can perhaps agree with Lawrence's decision to remove this rather tangential and abstract philosophizing. As well as revising the manuscript, we know from letters to Garnett and others that in the early months of 1913 Lawrence received the galley proofs of his novel, from which he was able to determine the extent of Garnett's deletions, and on which he made a number of further emendations. In a letter to Arthur McLeod, 8 February, 1913, he wrote "I am correcting proofs of Sons and Lovers —it gives me the blues" (p. 513). On 18 February, 1913 he informed Garnett that he had "corrected and returned the first batch of Sons and Lovers [proofs]. It goes well, in print, don't you think . . . You did the pruning job jolly well, and I am grateful" (p. 517). By 3 March he had "finished and returned all the proofs of Sons and Lovers " (p. 522). These proofs are no longer extant, but we can determine the nature of Lawrence's revisions on them by comparing the revised manuscript with the first British and American editions (London: Gerald Duckworth, 1913; New York: Mitchell Kennerly, 1913). However, what is not certain is whether some of these variants were not also the result of further editing by Garnett, or even, as Mark Schorer suggests, 2 by Gerald Duckworth. In light of their indeterminable authorship, therefore, I will not discuss these other emendations. In contrast to Lawrence, Edward Garnett, an acquaintance who became a close and lifelong friend, was clearly a more competent and consistent editor. He deleted those passages in the manuscript which interrupted the narrative in any way: by being redundant, abstract or philosophical, tangential to the main concerns of the novel, out of character, or simply sentimental or melodramatic. As most of these deletions are far too long to quote, I can only hope to give the reader an understanding of their specific nature by summarizing a few of the more significant ones. They are: 1. A paragraph describing the details of coal mining (I). 2. A paragraph about William's unwillingness to help his mother by looking after his younger sister Annie (I). 3. Most of three pages of manuscript concerning William's reaction to the new baby Paul, and a conversation between Mrs. Morel and a local minister (II). 4. A page of manuscript concerning Morel's arrival during the minister's visit (II). 5. A subsequent page of manuscript relating Mrs. Morel's success in undermining her husband's authority (II). 6. A half page in which the Morels shout at each other, with little point, followed by a paragraph in which Mrs. Morel, waiting impatiently for her husband, promises herself to remain silent when he finally arrives: She did not trust herself, however. Time after time she had said the same, determined to refrain, and then her sudden anger had flashed out. She wished, with the loathing of weariness, that she might be spared seeing him when he came home. The reason she would not go to bed and leave him to come in when he liked—let any woman tell. (II) This was not deleted because of poor writing, nor because it is sentimental. The writing is rather forceful—strong and succinct—but the passage is misleading because Mrs. Morel never attempts to silence her criticism of her husband; her articulation of his faults is part of her power over him. Furthermore, the reference to her jealousy was aptly deleted, for it is completely out of character. 7. A rather sentimental paragraph in which the infant Paul rejects his father's attention. 8. Four pages relating William's experiences as a private tutor (III). One begins to see a pattern in some of these deletions: prolonged references to William and Morel were taken out, leaving the narrative more concerned with Mrs. Morel's alienation, and her growing relationship with Paul. 9. Three pages of William's preparations for a dance, and a brief account of his French and Latin studies (III). 10. A page in which William receives a love letter, and Mrs. Morel disapproves (III). 11. A page in which Mrs. Morel tells Paul of her dissatisfaction with William, who is spending money on his girlfriend which she thinks is rightfully hers (V). 12. Three pages of triviality in which Paul and his mother prepare for their first visit to the Leivers, followed by a half page in which Paul engages Miriam's brothers in adolescent introductory conversation (VI). 13. A passage in which Mrs. Morel voices to Paul her dissatisfaction with William's announced intention of marriage. All such invectives will now be directed only against Paul and his lovers (VI). 14. A sentimental page in which Paul asks his mother if she ever wanted to be a man (VII). 15. Four pages in which Paul, as would the reader, had the piece remained, becomes bored awaiting Miriam in the library (VII). 16. A long abstract passage in which Paul and Miriam ponder the identity of "the bodily me" (VIII). 17. A page in which Paul discusses religion rather pretentiously with Mrs. Leivers (IX). 18. A half page of Paul pondering the concept of marriage (IX). 19. Two pages of discussion concerning the Suffragette Movement (IX). 20. Most of a very sentimental two-page letter from Paul to Miriam in which he contemplates the nature of love, marriage and fate, followed by a second letter, this one even more sentimental and quasi-philosophical. A segment from the first will exemplify Garnett's justification: When I talk to you, I do not look at you, often, for, can you understand, I do not talk to your eyes, though they are dark and fine, nor to your ears, hidden under a graceful toss of silky hair—but to your inside beyond. So I shall continue to do a whole life-time, if fate does not interfere. Do you see? And do you understand now why I only kiss you under mistletoe? Do you understand? and do I?—and is it better, think you? (IX). 3 And so on. Although many of the segments which Garnett deleted justifiably deserved excise, others, when we read them in the manuscript, seem less deserving, for they add to our understanding of the characters and their relationships. Mrs. Morel's fiery kinship with her son, William, for example, by being toned down through deletion, is less flavoursome; in addition, that part of the mother revealed through the son becomes hazy as well, so that when she does erupt against him, we may wonder at the reasons for such intense anger and frustration. This counters Lawrence's original intention somewhat; in the letter to Garnett (14 November, 1913) in which he outlined the novel, he clearly wished the first filial liaison to be with William, and to be fully developed, so that when the elder son rejects the affair, Paul becomes his replacement. However, it is likely that Garnett recognized in Lawrence a reluctance to develop the first part, and rather than advocate further writing, he simply changed the focus. In doing so, he certainly played an important part in the creative process. In fact, I think it would be fair to say that while Lawrence's critical ability—his objectivity—was improving (to the extent that he would produce, in his next two novels, virtual masterpieces of style and narrative control), that editorial capacity, which is completely satisfactory in very few writers, was at the time of revising the Sons and Lovers manuscript somewhat uneven and arbitrary. Some revisions are effective in sharpening the prose, making the scenes more graphic or dramatic, but others seem to impede this evolution of style. Changing "toddle" to "walk," for example, or "thoroughly" to the banal "nicely," seems to be an unconscious self-betrayal, and one wonders why Garnett did not exercise further editorial prerogative in these instances. Nevertheless, Garnett, for his purposes, edited the longer passages masterfully and thoroughly. His deletions rather than Lawrence's emendations are what turned a pedestrian and at times problematical manuscript into a powerful, concise, and evenly developed novel. And certainly Lawrence himself, though reticent at first, perhaps from anger, certainly from frustration, finally recognized Garnett's competency as an editor. On 25 February, 1913, while working on the proofs, he wrote to his friend and colleague: "You did well in the cutting—thanks again" (p. 520), and when the novel appeared, it contained a dedication which read: "To Edward Garnett."</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Stephen Crane's Sale of "An Episode of War" To The Youth's Companion by Paul Sorrentino</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Crane's reference to The Youth's Companion as the place of publication for "An Episode of War" has been confusing because none of his stories appeared there during his lifetime. The discovery remarked here of its posthumous publication in The Youth's Companion , however, confirms Fredson Bowers' hypothesis that Crane did, indeed, sell it to the magazine, and a headnote appended to the text helps to date the composition of the story. An extremely popular family magazine in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, The Youth's Companion solicited and published material from well-known authors like Longfellow, Whittier, Harriet Beecher Stowe and Francis Parkman. Following the instant success of The Red Badge of Courage , the Corresponding Editor wrote Crane on 31 October 1895 asking for a submission: Boston. October the 31 th [1895] &gt; Mr. Stephen Crane My dear sir In common with the rest of mankind we have been reading The Red Badge of Courage and other war stories by you. And our editors feel a strong desire to have some of your tales in The Youth's Companion. I want to invite you to submit some of your work to The Companion for consideration. While we have a number of standards inside of which all our stories have to fall I am confident that you would not find them a grave inconvenience. But to save you possible misdirection of effort, would you be so kind (if our invitation is acceptable to you) to write me and let me send you a few hints as to the kind of stories we want and dont want. Will you also let me say that for the higher grades of work the substantial recognition which The Companion gives to authors is not surpassed in any American periodical. Very Truly Yours The Corresponding Editor P.S. For your address I am indebted to the politeness of Messrs Copeland and Day, the former of whom is one of our editors. L. B. 1 Though Crane was then writing The Third Violet , he was interested in contributing: Hartwood Nov 5 th [1895] The Corresponding Editor, The Youth's Companion, My dear sir: I am very grateful for your letter of October 31st., and I am sure that I would be very glad to write for the Companion. My time is just now possessed by a small novel but in the future, I might perchance do a story that you would like. Such possible stories I would send to you, if I was informed of your literary platform and I would be happy to hear from you concerning it. Very truly yours, Stephen Crane. 2 The Editor most assuredly replied with a statement of "literary platform," for he wrote "Ans./Nov 9" at the top of the letter. Between November and March 1896, Crane wrote what has become known as "An Episode of War" and sold it to the Companion . Although an advertisement in the New York Press , 28 November 1896, p. 5, listed Crane as one of the ten "Leading Writers" for the magazine, the editors, apparently after acceptance, found the story unsuitable. Its sardonic treatment of war was probably too harsh for a family magazine that printed such "Departments" as "Nature and Science," "Current Events," and "Children's Page." To recover payment the publisher, Perry Mason &amp; Co., sold the English rights and sent a copy of the story to The Gentlewoman , which printed it in the December 1899 issue. 3 Twenty years later, however, as the country became disillusioned with war, the story proved timely. When an "Episode of War" eventually appeared in the 16 March 1916 issue of the Companion , p. 150, the editors appended a headnote: "When it is read in the light of the war news of to-day, this story has, we believe, an unusual interest. It was written for The Companion just twenty years ago this month by the young American who is best remembered for his battle story, 'The Red Badge of Courage.' Stephen Crane died in 1900, after a few years of brilliant achievement and even brighter promise." Because the version in The Youth's Companion (YC) is most likely not an edited reprint of that in The Gentlewoman (G), the question arises concerning the textual authority of YC. Crane had sent a now lost typescript of the story to The Youth's Companion , whose publisher retained the American and Canadian copyright, but sold the English copyright to The Gentlewoman . When the story appeared there, "Messrs. Perry, Mason and Co." was listed as the holder of copyright in the United States and Canada. Because no evidence suggests that Crane read proofs of G, it seems certain that this text derives from a second typescript prepared and sent by Mason. One would normally conclude, therefore, that YC should be used as copy-text and that the approximately 100 substantive and accidentals variants in G are not authorial. YC occasionally reflects Crane's manner of punctuation. 4 In a series of three, YC omitted the comma before and (91.5) and set off with a comma a dependent clause preceding an independent (92.30). YC's use of a dash instead of a comma after existence is typical of Crane and makes more sense in a story about the ironic deflation of the protagonist: "It is as if the wounded man's hand is upon the curtain which hangs before the revelations of all existence, [YC dash ] the meaning of ants, potentates, wars, cities, sunshine, snow, a feather dropped from a bird's wing, and the power of it sheds radiance upon a bloody form, and makes the other men understand sometimes that they are little" (90.15-20). The dash is similar to that in The Red Badge of Courage : "Later, he began to study his deeds—his failures and his achievements" (II, 133.27-28). G, however, is more characteristic of Crane's treatment of some other accidentals. Crane did not normally separate compound sentences with a comma before the conjunction, as in "He came upon some stragglers and they told him how to find the field hospital" (91.30-31), and he did not usually set off with commas parenthetical expressions, as in "And so the orderly-sergeant while sheathing the sword leaned nervously backward" (90.24-25). Crane frequently wrote a period where a question mark would be expected, as in "What mutton-head had tied it up that way anyhow" (92. 27-28), and he invariably hyphenated compound words, as in "war-chorus" (91.18) and "bush-fires" (91.25). Ten hyphenated compounds in G appear as separate words in YC. In addition, Crane preferred the English spelling of grey (90.24, 92.18) as opposed to gray in YC. G seems also to have more authority for at least some of the substantive variants. For example, the inclusion of green in "He saw a general on a black horse gazing over the lines of blue infantry at the green woods . . ." (90.38-39) typifies Crane's preoccupation with color, and the use of ' tend (92.31), which YC reads as attend , is appropriate for the speaker. Elsewhere in Crane's manuscripts—e.g., in Maggie (I, 22.5, 27.13, and 32.18)—he frequently used which for that , as in G's reading at 89.20 and 90.16, 37, 39. Finally Crane most certainly wrote ants , which YC deleted in "the revelations of all existence, the meaning of ants, potentates . . ." (90.16-17). Readings in YC occasionally correct grammatical errors. In "He held his right wrist tenderly in his left hand, as if the wounded arm was made of very brittle glass" (90.31-33), YC reads were for was . In all probability Crane wrote was , and an editor (or compositor) of The Gentlewoman missed the need for the subjunctive mood. 5 In 1916 an editor (or compositor) of The Youth's Companion corrected the error. If Crane had written were , the editor of G would have had no reason to create an error intentionally. Similarly someone in 1916 noticed the ambiguous pronoun reference in "He saw a general on a black horse gazing over the lines of blue infantry at the green woods which veiled his problems. An aide galloped furiously, dragged his horse suddenly to a halt, saluted, and presented a paper. It was, for a wonder, precisely like an historical painting" (90.38-91.3). YC changed It to This scene because the pronoun could be misread as referring to paper instead of the previous two sentences. In short, although G derives at one remove from the YC typescript, there is no way of knowing for certain whether variants were the result of house-styling in 1899 (G), 1916 (YC), or a combination of both. This is especially true, for Crane frequently seemed unconcerned with the general texture of accidentals; moreover, publishers have imposed since the nineteenth century an increasingly rigid house-style. Because G is closer to Crane's style, it should still be treated as copy-text and emended only if YC clearly preserves characteristics of Crane. The appearance of the story as "An Episode of War" raises speculation about its original title. Sometime in the late spring or early summer of 1897, Crane made an inventory of stories, which lists "An Episode of War" as "The Loss of an Arm" and its place of publication as "Youth's Companion" (VI, lxxx-lxxxi). The story also appears in two other inventories, but without title. On the verso of leaf 6 of the manuscript of "This Majestic Lie," Crane wrote, sometime before September 1899, a table of contents for a projected seven-volume collection of much of his fiction. Volume I was to include "Story—Youth's Companion." In another list, compiled in January 1900, Crane left space for a title but noted its place of publication as "Gentlewoman" (i.e., The Gentlewoman ). 6 Crane's method of notation in the second and third inventories could be attributed to his not having handy a copy of the manuscript and thus his forgetting the title, or he could have been undecided about what to call the story, as with "War Memories," which was variously titled "The Cuban Campaign" and "The Story for Lady Churchill" (V, cliv-clv). Perhaps the original title was "The Loss of an Arm: An Episode of War," which would have made it sound similar to The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War . Following the publication of the Red Badge , Crane was an instant celebrity whose incoming correspondence had, he said, "reached mighty proportions." 7 Crane might have used a longer title to take advantage of the success of his most famous work. Though the typescript that Crane sent to the Companion in March 1896 is not extant, the publication of "An Episode of War" in 1916 suggests that this title was, if not the complete original version, at least part of it. The text in the Companion is here collated with that in the Virginia edition (VI, 89-93). Each entry begins with a page-line reference. The first reading is from the edition; following the bracket is the reading in the Companion . A wavy dash (˜) signifies repetition of the same word in the edition; a subscript caret (∧) signifies lack of punctuation. An asterisk (*) means that the reader should consult the textual note for the entry in the Virginia edition.

Let somebody go over them—if you think best—and watch for bad grammatical form &amp; bad spelling. I am too jaded with Maggie to be able to see it" (R. W. Stallman and Lillian Gilkes, eds., Stephen Crane: Letters [1960], p. 122).

      <field name="heading_text">The Textual Development of William Faulkner's "Wash": An Examination of Manuscripts in the Brodsky Collection by Louis Daniel Brodsky</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On my discovery of the materials on which this article is based, it seemed plausible that they had remained in the same sequences Faulkner had given them almost fifty years before. Three distinct groups of manuscripts, each secured by and separated from each other with contemporary squarish paper clips, were all enclosed in an accordian-like, terra-cotta-hued pocket folder with flap and cloth ties. 1 One set of gatherings, carrying the twice-lined-through title "Wash," consisted of eight numbered holograph pages, 10frac1516 x 8½ inches, in Faulkner's fastidious blue-ink scrawl; all eight sheets were characterized by black horizontal and vertical margin rules and no watermarks. A second set of holograph leaves, also entitled "Wash," comprised twelve pages of similarly margined and unwatermarked 10frac1516 x 8½ inch paper. A third sheaf consisted of twenty-two numbered pages of ribbon typescript on Howard Bond watermarked paper, 10⅞ x 8⅜ inches, the first page of which bore the title "Wash" and the typed superscription in the upper left-hand margin: "William Faulkner | Oxford, Mississippi". Unfortunately, nowhere on any of the holographic or typescript sheets was the date of composition recorded. On closer scrutiny, the assumption that these materials had been left just as William Faulkner must have arranged them before clipping and inserting them into the folder became more probable; all pages of the typescript, numbered 1-22 at the bottom of each page, were in perfect order. All eight pages of one holograph version of the short story ran in perfect sequence, with the exception that the first page carried the pagination of both numerals "1" and "2", the numeral "2" being superimposed over the numeral "1", causing the sequence of this draft to run in the following manner: "2( ov. 1)", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9". This draft will subsequently be referred to as the "Revised Complete Holograph." 2 Finally, the remaining holographic group of twelve pages also appeared to be in sequential order, despite the fact that there was a preponderance of similarly-paginated leaves. The sequence of these pages runs as follows: "1", "2", "(2 del. ) 3", "3", "4", "5", "5", "6", "7", "(8 del. ) 7", "7", "8". Also, from the outset, it was visually evident that this series of pages comprised Faulkner's outtakes, those drafts which had been written, then, supplanted by revised drafts, set aside. Generally, in contradistinction to the eight-page draft (RCH), these pages were characterized by various interlineations, transpositions of entire paragraphs and sentences, deletions, marginal insertions, partial pages containing "false starts." This group will be referred to henceforth as the "Holograph Working Draft." 3 And in working through the holograph collation which follows, the fundamental assumption was borne out; all twelve pages were indeed in proper sequence, possibly even the order in which Faulkner reworked each page, then neatly discarded it, rendering all the discards or outtakes sequential in their own right. An alternative to this assumption is that even if Faulkner may not have composed his story in a cumulative manner, at some point he apparently ordered the various random drafts in the narrative sequence he intended to impose finally on all the outtakes before clipping and placing them securely into their folder. Once the actual collation of holographic drafts was undertaken, a number of startling revelations surfaced. Most notably, it seemed clear that Faulkner had in mind from the beginning the essential narrative elements of his story: namely, Wash staying home from the War while Sutpen goes off to fight, then returns to a ruined plantation, a widower, having also lost his son; Wash being turned away from the "Cunnel's" house by a negro servant; Wash drinking with Sutpen on Sundays in the scuppernong arbor, frequently carrying him to bed in a drunken stupor; Wash tending Sutpen's store, discovering the ribbon, then the dress Sutpen gives Wash's granddaughter, confronting Sutpen and being assuaged temporarily; Wash, the proud grandfather, remaining devoted to Sutpen through Milly's "obvious" pregnancy and birthing of a daughter; Wash's blind admiration and trust in Sutpen right up to the moment of Sutpen's pivotal rejection and debasement of Milly by relegating her to the status of a creature less valuable than a "mare" in a stall; Wash's retaliatory, stark, swift murder of Sutpen with the latter's rusty scythe, and ultimate performing of genocide on his granddaughter and newborn; the climactic conflagration of Wash's "fish-shack" house and his frenzied self-immolation before the posse's bullets. Yet, despite these apparent "knowns" or "givens," Faulkner demonstrates a decided groping not only for the most dramatic beginning for his tale, but, more significantly, an appropriate setting and dynamically justified motivational urgency for the ending to which he subjects his central protagonist and his foe. That Wash Jones would, by turns, worship, become disenchanted with, then finally murder Sutpen with the scythe seems clear enough; these notions are consistent from draft to draft, typescript to published story. Nor do the circumstances motivating Sutpen's effrontery and Jones's subsequent outrage change decidedly within the evolving story. However, what does change is the location of the revelation by which the information of Sutpen's inhumanity, his outrageous insult to Jones's granddaughter, gets transmitted to Wash Jones. This transmission of information and the revised mode of discovery are what affect the aesthetic choices from which Faulkner finally selects for his beginning and for the climax of the short story "Wash." One of the essential questions with which Faulkner, as story teller, had to grapple was how and where he should apply the emphasis for the central scene (that of Sutpen's relegating Jones's granddaughter to a level beneath that of a "mare" in a stable), from which Wash Jones emerges to set in motion a triple homicide. Should the immediate focus be placed on Wash or on Sutpen? And, in either case, where should the initial action of the story take place and when? An understanding of these choices, and of how Faulkner arrived at them, becomes available through close study of the various manuscript drafts of "Wash." Initially, Faulkner seems to have had two basic notions regarding emphasis on character and place and time, and he tried them both in alternative introductory settings. In one conception, he would introduce Wash Jones and relate in relatively chronological fashion a narrative spanning twenty years. This he attempted to do on page "2( ov. 1)" of the RCH, beginning: "He did not go away to fight the Yankees." Interestingly, he struck the entire first paragraph, as well as his working title, "Wash." It seems likely that Faulkner then set this sheet aside, penned the title "Wash" once more on a clean sheet, and began anew with what eventually became page "1" of the HWD, marking the shift from time past to time immediate with the following opening sentence: "He was probably watching, hidden, when Sutpen walked out of the house that a.m." However, Faulkner apparently soon discovered the need for his narrative to revert to earlier events, rather than treating either the immediate reason for Wash's "hidden" presence or Sutpen's leaving his own house so early on a Sunday morning; a Sunday the reader will soon learn is time immediate, the very immediate present in which Sutpen and Wash will confront each other for the last time. Having written all of page "1" and partially into page "2" of the HWD, it seems Faulkner then discarded these pages and returned to his original page "1" (RCH); then, presumably because he had already written two pages of outtakes, "1" and "2" (HWD), he superimposed a "2" over the "1" (RCH), reinstating, also, the cancelled title as well as the initial paragraph which he had formerly emphatically lined out, and set about telling the narrative in more or less chronological manner. Thus, Faulkner had decidedly opted to place the emphasis almost completely on Wash instead of on Sutpen. The central event, undeveloped as it was in the first page of the HWD, would not be finally arrived at and revealed until page "6" in both the RCH and the HWD. As one proceeds through the various discarded sheets, Faulkner's technique of composition begins to clarify itself; it appears that he would write as far as he could before realizing the existence of a specific problem, then take up a new sheet, number it similarly, and, usually, begin again with the material which had begun the discarded sheet, always trying to filter in and retain in the newer version whatever of the previous material he might still find instrumental before heading off in a new direction. This process appears to be one characterized by advancement and retreat, regrouping, then charging forward again. Such is the case, for example, as Faulkner composed "(2 del. )3" of the HWD; sensing his direction was inappropriate as he finished writing the last paragraph on the page, he vigorously lined it completely out, began to develop his thought again on a clean sheet (page "3" HWD), and stopped. In the first abandoned paragraph, as in the first one on the clean sheet, Faulkner found himself describing a scene in which Wash "looked down at the quilt pallet on which his granddaughter lay with a newborn child." Faulkner, compellingly aware that his timing for the introduction of this information was premature, took up another clean sheet, and, this time, omitting the entire scene in which Wash encounters his granddaughter and her newborn, recycled in more compressed form the material he had fashioned on page "(2 del. )3" of the HWD. In fact, he even started the clean sheet with the exact sentence that began the discarded sheet: "a man whose own company bored him." However, Faulkner did pick up and retain one strand from the "postponed" material; in both discarded paragraphs, the transition employed was a temporal one. On page "(2 del. )3" (HWD), the opening sentence reads: "And even 5 years later, when . . ." On page "3" (HWD), the unused paragraph opens: "5 years later, . . ." Catching his stride and timing, Faulkner realized he must further develop the relationship between Sutpen and Wash. Having described Sutpen's return to the ruined plantation on page "3" (RCH), Faulkner wrote: "That was the tenor of their talk for the next 5 years." This picks up the initial transitional strand while keeping the narrative in line. In fact, the abandoned narrative scene does appear in the RCH, but not until page "6": "He entered the house. He moved clumsily. . . . But even above the pallet he could see little save the blur of his granddaughter's exhausted face in a frame of hair." Ultimately, what one discovers in working through all the drafts is that most of what Faulkner conceived, if temporarily deleted, would eventually find its way back into the narrative, either as a germ or in expanded form. So often, Faulkner simply had to wait for the elements to coalesce, then pause briefly on his own aesthetic judgment to locate them in a more appropriate temporal and dramatic context. On the other hand, one major substantive change that does occur in moving from the HWD to the RCH seems actually to hark back, perhaps, to one of the initial notions which Faulkner experienced when he considered beginning the story with Sutpen leaving his house on that fated Sunday morning. Faulkner tells the reader on page "1" (HWD) that Wash was "probably watching, hidden, when Sutpen walked out of the house that a.m." The operative word here is "hidden"; indeed, it may even be the "creative synapse," that linkage or junction point at which intuition, imagination, conception, and the rudiments of execution conjoin for any author. At this inchoate point, Faulkner, quite possibly, may have had flash across his imaginative screen, or envisioned inexorably the fundamental insight on which the entire story would turn. Principally, the germ of that word, "hidden," actually may have contained for Faulkner hints not only of the murder to come but the inherent notion of Wash's flight from the scene of the crime. Foreshadowed in this first sentence, in this key word, may have been all the main events antecedent to the story's originally-conceived climax. And even after Faulkner decided against initially disclosing the convulsive climactic murder, which surely he recognized would destroy the dramatic tension of his narrative, shifting instead to a straightforward relation of events focusing on Wash mainly, rather than on Sutpen, Faulkner did eventually develop his original vision in which Wash, having indeed committed the balefully foreshadowed murder, does flee. In the first of three separate attempts to delineate Wash's flight from the crime scene (pages "7", "(8 del. ) 7", "7", and "8" HWD), Faulkner writes: "He was lying hidden now . . . he was safe enough there, back in the swamp then at the site of an abandoned sawmill, . . ." (the first page "7" of the HWD). Here he imagined the men with their horses and dogs and guns coming to hunt him down. All three versions of page "7" in the HWD stipulate that Wash hides carefully the scythe because he might have use for it again, and contain qualifying statements to reassure the reader that Wash is not fleeing: "as tho the act itself symbolised the fact that he was not fleeing." From the outset, it appears that Faulkner had ambivalent feelings about the direction and outcome of his character, Wash. Ultimately, the author resolves his dilemma, realizes that he need not attempt to qualify Wash's apparent flight as one motivated by cowardice; he aborts these attempts completely. Matter-of-factly, finishing the scene in which Wash annihilates Sutpen by having the murderer reenter the fish shack, Faulkner drops altogether the concept of having Wash flee and take refuge in the abandoned sawmill in the swamp. This strategy is clearly arrived at after intensive working through of the alternative scenario. Its presence allows the story to progress inexorably toward its intended dénouement without ambivalent or inconsistent character developments. Tangential to these matters is the slightly more perplexing existence of the 22-page ribbon typescript that accompanied these holograph manuscripts. For one thing, even though there are approximately 138 presumable editorial revisions in the print which distinguish this typescript version from the one published in the February, 1934 issue of Harper's Magazine , the two versions are almost identical substantively. In almost all cases, the published changes amount to what seem to be the magazine editor's alterations in the accidentals and minor substantives, such as: correcting typographical errors; occasional transpositions of words, providing omitted letters or punctuation marks (most notably, commas, apostrophes, periods, hyphens, and double quotation marks in place of single marks); replacement of indefinite pronouns with specific referents; and, occasionally, the supplying of a lapsed word. Because these corrections exist nowhere on the pages of this 22-page typescript, it would seem unlikely that this specific ribbon manuscript served as the setting copy for the published version. However, this 22-page typescript is not identical with the 8-page RCH; although with one major exception it does not deviate narratively, many of its sentences and phrases evidence further revisionary tightening, rewording to heighten and intensify the texture of the prose context. The following five corresponding passages from the RCH and 22-page typescript both exemplify and typify the revisionary compression and heightening to which Faulkner subjected his prose as it progressed toward a finished state: He knew where the ribbon came from; he had been seeing it and its kind daily for (4 del. ) 3 ( superimposed over deleted 4) years, (He knew now del. ) even if she had lied about where she got it, which she did not, with a kind of defiant watchfulness. "Sho now," he said. "Efn Kernel wants to give hit to you, I hope you thanked him." (Page "4" RCH) He knew where the ribbon came from; he had been seeing it and its kind daily for three years, even if she had lied about where she got it, which she did not, at once bold, sullen, and fearful. "Sho now," he said. "Ef Kernel wants to give hit to you, I hope you minded to thank him." (Page "9", 22-page typescript) He realised it was dawn suddenly, by the fact that he could now see the house and the old negress in the door looking at him. (Page "5" RCH) Then it was dawn. Suddenly he could see the house, and the old negress in the door looking at him. (Page "12", 22-page typescript) "You said ---" To his own ears Wash's voice sounded flat, ducklike, like a deaf man's. "You said efn she was a mare, you could give her a better stall than thisn." (Page "6" RCH) "You said ---" To his own ears Wash's voice sounded flat and ducklike, like a deaf man's. "You said if she was a mare, you could give her a good stall in the stable." (Page "14", 22-page typescript) Better that all who remain of us be blasted from the face of earth than that another Wash Jones should see his whole life shredded from him and shrivel away like shucks thrown into the fire . (Page "8" RCH) Better that all who remain of us be blasted from the face of earth than that another Wash Jones should see his whole life shredded from him and shrivel away like a dried shuck thrown onto the fire . (Page "20", 22-page typescript) Yet still the gaunt, wild figure came on, against the furious glare of the blazing shack. With the scythe lifted it bore down upon them, upon the wild glinting eyes of the plunging horses and the last gleaming of gun barrels, without a word, without a sound. (Page "9" RCH) Yet still the gaunt, furious figure came on against the glare and roar of the flames. With the scythe lifted it bore down upon them, upon the wild glaring eyes of the horses and the swinging glints of gun barrels, without any cry, any sound. (Page "22", 22-page typescript) At this point, it is worth postulating a theory relative to the existence of this 22-page typescript. Namely, from the comprehensive nature of the "adjustments" Faulkner made in his syntax and grammar, diction and imagery, it seems highly plausible that there may have been an intervening holograph or typescript draft which advanced the story from the RCH toward this 22-page script typed by Faulkner. Of utmost significance in this extant typescript is the two-page "set-piece" which, at some point after completing his story in manuscript, Faulkner conceived and added to the story's ultimate beginning. The scene in which Sutpen stands above the pallet on which Milly and her new-born child lie is redolent of Faulkner's earliest intuition of having Sutpen exit from his house, with Wash, hidden, watching him; it seems to return to the original alternative of focusing on Sutpen, rather than on Wash, after all, to heighten the starkness of his cruelty. Only now, Wash is not watching Sutpen, but listening to him while tending to his horse just outside the fish shack in which Sutpen monstrously refuses to claim paternity of the girl he has sired by Wash's granddaughter, Milly Jones. This same passage also transposes and intensifies dramatically the similar scene described on page "6" of both the RCH and the HWD. Clearly, Faulkner's intention is to bring the reader into the most immediate time possible, and make him not only aware of the central dilemma Wash has had to contend with, but actually to make the reader a participant in the crisis with Wash as the story unfolds. In the process, Faulkner also successfully fractures the otherwise rather straightforward chronology of the narrative. Although this event will still be narrated as it had been in both the RCH and the HWD, its inclusion as a dramatic "set-piece" in the beginning of the story helps create an active, rather than a passive telling of the event; although related omnisciently in all three instances, it now achieves a directness that the reader must carry with him throughout the entire unfolding of the drama. A visual review of this typescript would seem to preclude the notion that Faulkner, in a flash of inspiration, had hit upon the idea of the "set-piece" scene and composed it directly onto the paper. The first two pages are typed too cleanly; there are relatively few typographical mistakes. Yet, the one instance of lengthy holographic correction at the end of the "set-piece" (page "2"), in which Faulkner compresses two sentences into one, indeed might suggest the likelihood of there having been another typescript precedent to this one; one which contained the "new" beginning for the first time, while advancing the previously-worked prose one more stage beyond the limits reached in the RCH. That this conceivable typescript did not exist with the other drafts in the pocket folder may have been the result of Faulkner's having given it as a gift to someone at some time prior to his finally presenting the three drafts in the Brodsky Collection to Professor James W. Silver in the mid-Fifties. To facilitate use of the comparison of the two holograph drafts which follow immediately below, I have resorted to placing a bracketed letter beside each page number in both the HWD and the RCH; running from A through T, each letter places its corresponding page in the sequence in which presumably Faulkner originally composed "Wash." Also, square brackets containing material followed by the phrase " del. " have been employed for denoting words, sentences, and entire paragraphs that were deleted in the evolutionary process of composing "Wash." Square brackets also are used with the term "MARGIN:" to encapsulate words and sentences which had been cribbed into the inner left margin of the writing paper; materials which Faulkner obviously intended to be interpolated into the narrative at a particular juncture by means of a line drawn from the marginal entry to that point of insertion in the text. Square brackets containing the phrase " illeg. " are used sparingly to justify exclusion of a recalcitrant letter or word. Angle brackets have been designated to denote interlineated words and phrases; these usually occur where Faulkner was merely replacing one word above another which he had struck through. In addition to the holograph drafts, I have included a complete transcription of Faulkner's 22-page typescript of "Wash." It contains an internal collation of the alterations the author himself made in the script both by pen and typewriter. The complete transcription, printed here exactly as Faulkner typed it, is followed by a separate, external collation keyed to the February, 1934 issue of Harper's Magazine in which "Wash" was first published. The comparison of the two extant holograph manuscript drafts of the story "Wash" and the transcription of the 22-page typescript which follow vividly illuminate the evolutionary creative process of composition Faulkner experienced in developing this story. Above all, they highlight and underscore the fastidious and methodical concentration Faulkner gave to detail and narrative consistency and character development; they demonstrate a marvelous architectonic devotion to texture and structure. They do, in fact, expose the author's superstructure and fretwork simultaneously, and, as such, remain as blueprints which provide a unique opportunity to see from without the inner workings of a masterbuilder.

"Nor nothing else but dat shack down yon in de slough dat Cunnel wouldn't leave none of us live in," the slave would reply; whereupon Wash—a gaunt man, appearing without age, tho the father of a woman with an 8 year old girl child—would glare and curse the negro house servant, who never looked at him, laughing, until the white man rushed at the black, sometimes grasping up a stick, whereupon the negro would retreat, [He did not go away to fight the Yankees.

Sometimes, as time went on and bitter news began to come down from the Tennessee mountains and from Vicksburg in the west and then Sherman passed thru the plantation itself and most of the slaves followed him, this would occur in the very back yard of the big house itself. There the negro would retreat up the kitchen steps and turn again in the door. "Stop right dar, man. Stop right whar you is. You aint never crossed dese steps when Cunnel here, and you aint ghy do it now." knowing that his sole connection with the Sutpen plantation lay in the fact that Colonel Sutpen had for years allowed him to squat in a crazy shack on a slough in the river bottom on the Sutpen place, which Sutpen had built for a fishing lodge in his [younger del. ] [MARGIN: bachelor] days and [abandoned del. ] which had since fallen into disuse and dilapidation until now it looked like an aged or sick wild beast crawled terrifically there to drink [before dying del. ] in the act of dying.

'I aint even going to give Cunnel the chance to have to cuss a nigger on my account'; tho he and Sutpen had spent many an afternoon together; usually on a Sunday when there were no company in the house.

"Because I got a daughter and family to keep," he said. "Git out of my way, niggers." "Niggers?" they repeated. "Niggers?" laughing now. "Who him, calling us niggers?" "Yes," he said. "I aint got no niggers to look after my folks when I'm gone." "Nor nothing else but dat shack down yon dat Cunnel wouldn't let none of us live in." Now he cursed them; sometimes, goaded so, he rushed at them, grasping a stick up from the ground while they scattered before him, tho seeming to surround him still with that black laughing derisive, evasive, inescapable. Once it occurred in the very back yard of the big house itself. This was after bitter news had come down from the Tennessee mountains and from Vicksburg in the west, and Sherman had passed thru the plantation and most of the negros had followed him.

It was in the rear of the tiny store which Sutpen had contrived to set up on the highroad: a frame [room del. ] shelved room where, with Wash for clerk, he dispensed meagrely kerosene and staple food and stale gaudy [candy del. ] [a del. ] sweets and cheap beads and ribbons to negroes [and del. ] &lt;or&gt; poor whites [stock del. ] of Wash's [kind del. ] own kind, who came afoot to haggle tediously [with them del. ] for dimes and quarters with the man who at one time could gallop (Sutpen still had the black stallion; the stable in which the stallion's [get [ illeg. ] del. ] jealous get lived was in better repair than the house where the owner lived) for 10 miles on his own fertile land who had led troops gallantly in battle, until Sutpen in fury would empty the store, close and lock the doors from the inside. Then he and Wash would repair to the rear and the jug. But the talk would not be quiet now, as when Sutpen lay in the hammock [talking del. ] delivering [a monologue del. ] an arrogant monologue while Wash squatted guffawing against his Holograph Working Draft Revised Complete Holograph (Page) "3" [E] 5 years later, &lt;when&gt; in a gray dawn he looked down at the quilt pallet on which his granddaughter, now 17, lay with a newborn child, his heart was still quiet. An old negro woman had officiated; she now stooped above the rusted slip scraps which served them for warmth, [and cast del. ] lifting a coal into her pipe. He watched her as she [began to del. ] puffed the pipe into life. "Well?" he said. He spoke harsher than he intended, because he would have to ask her, a negro, to wait for her money.

They both sat now, tho Sutpen had the single chair while Wash used whatever box or keg was handy, and this for just a little while because soon Sutpen would reach that stage of impotent undefeat [and [ illeg. ] del. ] when he would rise, swaying and plunging, and declare again that he would take his pistol and the black stallion [(now a year dead) del. ] and ride singlehanded into Washington and kill Lincoln, [also del. ] dead now, and Sherman, now a private citizen. "Kill them!" he would shout. "Shoot them down like dogs —" "Sho, Kernel; sho, Kernel," Wash would say, catching Sutpen as he fell. Then he would commandeer the first passing wagon, or lacking that, he would walk a mile down the road and borrow one and take (Page) "4" [G] Sutpen home. He entered the house now. He had been doing so for some years, taking Sutpen home thus, actually carrying him, talking him into locomotion with cajoling murmurs as tho he almost were a horse, a stallion himself, being met by Sutpen's daughter who without a word would hold open the door for them to enter. He would carry his [half wit del. ] burden through a once white [doorw del. ] entrance [surrounded by a fanlight del. ] surmounted by a fanlight imported piece by piece from France and with a board now nailed over a missing pane, across a velvet carpet from which all knap was now gone, and up a stairway where carpet, runner, was now but a fading ghost of bare board between 2 strips of fading paint, and into a bedroom. It was usually dusk by now and he would help his burden to sprawl onto the bed and straighten its legs and then he would sit quietly in a chair beside it. After a time the daughter would come to the door. "Nome," Wash would tell her. "We're all right. Dont you worry none." Then it would be dark and after a while he would lie on the floor beside the bed, tho not to sleep, because after a time — maybe before midnight — the man in the bed would stir. "Wash?" Sutpen would say. "Hyer I am, Kernel. You go back to sleep. We aint whupped yit. Me and you kin do hit." (Page) "4" [H] Sutpen home. He entered the house now. He had been doing so for some years, taking Sutpen home in whatever borrowed wagon, talking him into locomotion with cajoling murmurs as tho he were a horse, a stallion himself. The daughter would meet them and hold &lt;open&gt; the paintless door without a word. He would carry his burden thru the once white formal entrance surmounted by a fanlight [brot del. ] imported piece by piece from Europe and with a board now nailed over a missing pane, across a velvet carpet from which all nap was gone, and up a formal stair where carpet, runner, was now but a fading ghost of bare boards between 2 strips of fading paint, and into the bedroom.

"We're all right now," Wash would say. "Dont you worry none, Miss Judith." Then it would be dark and after a while he would lie on the floor beside the bed, tho not to sleep, because after a time — [per del. ] sometimes before midnight — the man on the bed would stir: "Wash?"

Holograph Working Draft Revised Complete Holograph That is what he thot when he saw the first ribbon on his granddaughter. She was now a girl of 15, already mature, after the way of her kind.

"Sho, now," Wash said. "Hit's right pretty." Then he approached Sutpen, waiting until he had closed the store for the day. "Get the jug." Sutpen directed. "Wait," Wash said. "Not for a minute yit." Neither did Sutpen deny the dress; perhaps he realised it would be fruitless. "What about it?" he said. "I'm 5 [o[ ov. 8] del. ] &lt;50&gt; years old, Wash. You and me are old men. Too old to [ illeg. ] any [ illeg. ], even if I wanted to." "That's hit. Any other man your age would be old. But you air different from other men." "How different?" (Page) "5" [I] Now it was Sutpen who looked away, turning suddenly, almost brusquely. "Get the jug," he said, sharply. "Sho, Kernel," Wash said. Even then, he had already seen the ribbon about his daughter's waist. She was now 15, already mature, after the way of her kind. He knew where the ribbon came from; he had been seeing it and its kind daily for [4 del. ] 3 [superimposed over deleted "4"] years, [He knew now del. ] even if she had lied about where she got it, which she did not, with a kind of defiant watchfulness. "Sho now," he said. "Efn Kernel wants to give hit to you, I hope you thanked him." His heart did not surge with triumph or pride, nor yet with fear; not even when he saw the dress, saw her secret, defensive, almost frightened face when she told him that Miss Judith, the daughter, had helped her to make it. He was merely quite grave when he approached Sutpen when he closed the store that p.m. "Get the jug," Sutpen [said del. ] directed. "Wait," Wash said. "Not right yit, for a minute."

"If you was any other, I would say you was as old as me. And old or no old, I wouldn't let her keep that dress or nothing else that came from you. But you are different." "How different?

From the house, where the lamp shined [bey del. ] dim beyond the warped door frame, his granddaughter's voice came steadily as tho run by a clock, while thinking went slowly and terrifically, fumbling, involved somehow with a sound of galloping hooves until there broke suddenly free in gallops the fine proud figure of the man on the fine proud stallion, galloping; and then that at which thinking fumbled broke free too and quite clear, not in justification nor even in explanation, but as the apotheosis, lonely, explicable, beyond all fouling by human touch: 'He is bigger than all them Yankees that kilt his son and his wife and [ruined his pla del. ] taken his niggers and ruined his land, bigger than this hyer durn country that he fit for and that denied him, bigger than the denial hit helt to his lips like the cup the Book tells about.

"A girl. Sho, now." It was getting light fast; soon the sun of Miss. latitudes. He turned and looked toward the east. "Hit'll ketch me before I Holograph Working Draft Revised Complete Holograph git thar,' he thot, moving on, passing the corner of the porch where the scythe leaned which he had borrowed 3 months ago to cut away the weeds which choked the steps. He looked at it, passing. 'In a way, you might say that he was represented, anyhow.'

'You might say that he was represented in a way, anyhow,' he thot, going on. Almost at once he heard the horse. He stepped out of the path to let the old stallion pass, his face lifted, [bright, weary, del. ] ------------------------ [Hi del. ] "Hit's a gal, Kernel," he shouted. But Sutpen only lifted his whip hand and (Page) "6" [M] "A girl," he repeated; "a girl"; in astonishment, hearing the galloping hooves, [seeing for an instant the proud galloping del. ] seeing the proud galloping figure emerge again and seem to pass before his eyes thru avatars culminating in [that del. ] one where it galloped beneath a brandished saber and a shot torn flag rushing down a sky in color like sulphur, thinking for the first time in his life that perhaps Sutpen was an old man like himself, after all. 'Gittin a gal,' he thot in that astonishment; then he thot [in del. ] with the pleased surprise of a child: 'Yes, sir. Be dawg if I aint lived to be a great grandpaw, after all.' He entered the house. He moved clumsily, on tiptoe, as tho he no longer lived there, as tho the infant which had just drawn breath and cried had dispossessed him, be it his own blood too tho it might. But even above the pallet he could see little save the blur of his granddaughter's exhausted face in a frame of hair. Then the negress squating on the [ illeg. ] fire spoke. "You better gawn tell him ef you going to. Hit' [it del. ]s daylight now." But this was not necessary. He had no more than turned the corner of the porch where the scythe leaned which he had borrowed 3 months ago to cut away the weeds thru which he walked, when Supten rode up on the old stallion. He did not wonder how Sutpen had got the word. He merely took it for granted that this was what had got the other out at this hour, and he stood while Sutpen dismounted and he [handed him the reins del. ] took the reins from the other with on his gaunt face an expression almost imbecile with a kind of weary triumph, saying, "Hit's a gal, Kernel. I be dawg if Holograph Working Draft Revised Complete Holograph went on. He looked as tho he too had not slept much. So Wash followed.

He was standing in the path when Sutpen emerged, tho they were not 5 feet apart when Sutpen seemed to notice him. "Well?" Sutpen said. "You called [my grand del. ] her a mare. You said if she was a mare, you would give her a stall in the stable." "Well?" Wash advanced toward him. "Stand back. Dont touch me, Wash." "I'm going to tech you, Kernel," [ illeg. del. ] Wash said. Sutpen struck him across the face with the whip. Wash fell back. When he advanced this time, he held the scythe in his hands. "I'm going to tech you, Kernel," he said. you aint as old as I am —" until Sutpen passed him without a word and entered the house. He was standing there and heard what Sutpen said as he looked down at the pallet. Something seemed to stop in him for an instant before going on. The sun was now up, the swift sun of Mississippi latitudes, and [he del. ] it seemed to him that he stood beneath a strange sky, in a strange scene, familiar only as things are familiar in dream, like the dream of falling to one who has never climbed. 'I kaint have heard what I thot I heard,' he thot quietly. 'I know I kaint.' Yet the voice, the known voice which had spoken the words was going on, talking now to the old negress about a colt foaled that a.m. 'That's why he was up so early,' he thot. 'That was hit. Hit aint me and mine. Hit aint even hisn that got him outen bed and down hyer—' Sutpen emerged. He descended into the weeds, moving with that heavy deliberation which would have been haste [if he del. ] when he was young. He hardly looked at Wash stooped a little among the weeds beside the house. "Dicey will stay and tend to her. You better —" Then he seemed to see Wash. He paused. "What?" he said. "You said —" To his own ears Wash's voice sounded flat, ducklike, like a deaf man's. "You said efn she was a mare, you could give her a better stall than thisn." "Well?" Sutpen said. [Wash del. ] His eyes widened and narrowed, almost like a man's fists flexing and shuting, as Wash, still stooping, advanced toward him — that [ illeg. ], equable, servile man whom in 20 years he had never known to make an unhidden volitional movement beyond that necessary to walk. "Stand back," Sutpen said suddenly, sharply: "dont you touch me." "I'm going to tech you, Kernel." Wash said in that flat voice, advancing. Sutpen did not retreat; he did not glance behind him, tho the old negress now peered around the crazy Holograph Working Draft Revised Complete Holograph (Page) "7" [N] door with the black gargoyle face of a worn gnome. He raised the hand which held the riding whip. "Stand back, Wash," he said. Then he struck. The old negress sprang down into the weeds as nimble as a goat, and fled. Neither of them saw her. Sutpen slashed Wash again across the face, the force of the blow knocking Wash to his knees. But he rose again, turning toward the porch beside him. When he turned back he held in his hands the scythe which he had borrowed from Sutpen 3 months ago and which Sutpen would never need again. ------------------------ He hid the scythe carefully before he departed, as tho he intended to need it again, as tho the act itself symbolised the fact that he was not fleeing [he thot without self pity, 'I aint got nowhere to run to.

He was lying hidden now, thru a long bright sunny day, not so far but he could see, feel them galloping with their horses and guns and dogs, to pursue him and hunt him down.

That was who they thot that he would run from. It seemed to him that he had no more to run from than he had to run to. He saw now that he must flee (if he were Holograph Working Draft Revised Complete Holograph to flee) bragging and evil shadows, into and across other bragging and evil shadows just like them, since they were all of a kind and he was old, too old to flee far, even if he were to flee.

He did not attempt to better his position, tho men came to look into the bowl. They rode on, talking quiet: he could almost hear what they were saying because he already knew what it was, what they had been saying and thinking ever since the old negress reached the first [cabin: del. ] house: Old Wash Jones he come a tumble at last. He thot he had "I want a sup of water," she said querulously. "I been laying here wanting a sup of water for a long time, but dont nobody pay me no mind." "Sho now," he said soothingly. He fetched the dipper and raised her head to drink and laid her back and watched her turn to the child with an absolutely stonelike face. But a moment later he saw that she was crying quietly. "Now, now," he said. "I wouldn't do that. Old Dicey says hit's a right fine gal." But she continued to cry quietly, almost sullenly, and he rose and stood uncomfortably above the pallet for a time, [before he moved away and drew a chair up to the window and sat down. del. ] thinking as he had thot when his own wife lay so and then his daughter in turn: 'Women. Hit's a mystery to me. To ara man. They seem to want em and yit when they git em they cry about hit.' Then he moved away and drew a chair up to the window and sat down. Through all that long, bright, sunny forenoon he sat there, waiting. Now and then he rose and tiptoed to the pallet.

[MARGIN: wondering why it was so long, until he remembered that it was Sunday] He was sitting there at [better than noon del. ] &lt;midafternoon&gt; when they found the body, when a halfgrown white boy came around the corner of the house upon it and gave a choked cry and looked up and saw Wash sitting in the window and gave him a wild mesmerised glare before he turned and fled.

But she would not eat when he carried her [and he found that he too ha del. ] so he ate quietly, alone, and left the soiled [ illeg. ] dish where it lay and returned to the chair] Holograph Working Draft Revised Complete Holograph Sutpen but Sutpen fooled him. He thot he had Kernel where he would have to marry old Wash's gal or pay up. And Kernel refused . "But I never expected that, Kernel!" he cried, aloud suddenly, his voice so sudden and so loud in the bright silence as to cause him to start, to leave him a little aghast at his own voice, tho still without alarm yet or fear. Nevertheless some old instinct of hiding and flight held him [ illeg. ], looking this way and that while thinking went smoothly on: 'You know I never. You know how I aint never expected [ara thing from ara man in my life but you. That what I expected from you wasn't nothing that could be teched or helt in the hand del. ] or asked are thing from ara living man but what (Page) "8" [Q] I expected from you. And I didn't ask that. I didn't think hit would need. I says to myself, I dont need to. What need has a fellow like Wash Jones to question [MARGIN: or doubt] the man that General Lee himself says in a handwrote ticket that he was brave? Now it was almost sunset.

The closest word to it for a mistake that had lasted 20 years. del. ] Home. The closest word to it for a mistake that had lasted 20 years.

It was dark when he neared home, because he moved cautious, listening as he moved. He believed that there would be some of Now he seemed to sense, feel, the men who would gather, with horses and dogs and the guns which they would not need. [They would be led, directed, by men del. ] — the curious, and the vengeful: men of Sutpen's own kind, who had made the company about his table in the time when he had yet to approach nearer to the house than the scuppernong arbor — men who had also shown the lesser men like him how to fight in battle, who maybe also had signed papers from the generals saying that they were among the first of the brave; who had also galloped in the old days arrogant and proud on the fine horses on the fine plantations — symbols also of admiration and hope; instruments &lt;too&gt; of despair and grief. That was who they would expect him to run from. It seemed to him that he had no more to run from (Page) "8" [S] than he had to run to. If he ran, he would merely be fleeing one set of bragging and evil shadows for another just like them, since they were all of a kind throughout all the earth which he knew, and he was old, too old to flee far even if he were to flee. He could never escape them, no matter how much or how far he ran: a man going on 60 could not run that far. Not far enough to escape beyond the boundaries of earth where such men lived, set the order and the rule of living. He saw now for the first time, after 5 years, how it was that Yankees or any other living men had managed to whip them: the gallant, the proud, the brave; the acknowledged and chosen best among them all to carry courage and honor and pride. Maybe if he had gone to the war with them he would have discovered them [without having to see all that he had del. ] sooner. But if he had discovered them sooner, what would he have done with his life since? how could he have borne for 5 years to remember what his life had been before? Now it was getting toward sunset. The child had whimpered and wailed; when he [tiptoed del. ] went to the pallet he saw that his granddaughter was feeding it, her face still Holograph Working Draft Revised Complete Holograph them concealed about the house; he was a little surprised when he reached it and heard his granddaughter whimpering and moaning in the darkness. He had forgotten about her. 'I reckon she's been here alone all day,' he thot. 'Hit's plenty of them can spend the day on the chance of getting a shot at me, but nara a one of them had time to see that she had a sup of water even.' He entered the house. Now that he had penetrated where the line of pistols would be, he ceased trying for stealth, tho moving quietly. His granddaughter [heard him and spoke in the pale darkness, her del. ] continued to whimper and moan. "Milly," he said quietly, "Milly." She continued to whimper and moan. He moved carefully and found the pallet and knelt beside it, and fumbled and found her face. It was hot and dry. bemused, sullen, inscrutable. "Air you hungry yit?" he said. "I dont want nothing." "You ought to eat." She didn't answer, musing upon the child. He returned to his chair and found that the sun had set. 'Hit kaint be much longer,' he thot. He could sense them quite near now, the curious and the vengeful. He could even seem to hear what they were saying about him: Old Wash Jones he come a tumble at last. He thot he had Sutpen but Sutpen fooled him. He thot he had Kernel where [ Kernel del. ] he would have to marry the gal or pay up. And Kernel refused . "But I never expected that, Kernel!" he cried aloud, catching himself at the sound of his own voice, looking quickly to see his granddaughter looking at him. "Kernel?" she said. "Is he —" "Hit aint nothing," he said. "I was just thinking and talked out before I knowed hit." She looked down again, bemused, sullen, indistinct now. "I reckon so. I reckon you'll have to talk louder than that before he'll hyer you." "Sho now," he said. "Dont you worry now." But already thinking was going smoothly on: "You know I never. You know how I aint never expected or asked ara thing from ara living man but what I expected from you. And I never asked that. I didn't think it would need. I said, I dont need to. What need has a fellow like Wash Jones to question or doubt that man that General Lee himself says in a handwrote ticket that he was brave? [His kind looked on my kind as less than niggers,' he thot.

Better that all who remain of us be blasted from the face of earth than that another Wash Jones should see his whole life shredded from him and shrivel away like shucks thrown into the fire . He ceased, became still, motionless. He heard the horses, suddenly and plainly; presently he saw the lantern. Yet he did not stir. He listened to the voices and the sounds of underbrush as they [ illeg. ] about the house. He watched the lantern come on until the light fell upon Sutpen's body, where the group halted, the horses tall, the men on foot shadowy — legs, horse and man, the glint and shadow of guns. A voice said, "Jones." (Page) "9" [T] "I'm here," he said quietly. "That you, Major?" "Come out." "I'm coming. I just want to see to my granddaughter." "We'll see to her. Come out." "Sho, Major. Just a minute." "Show a light, then. Light your lamp." "Sho. In just a minute." He was already moving, swift and silent. From the pallet his granddaughter spoke, fretfully: "What is it? Why dont you light the lamp." "Sho," he said, soothingly, quietly; ["Hit wont need no light." del. ] He went unerringly to the crack in the chimney where he kept the butcher knife. His hand touched it; the one thing in his sloven life and house in which he took care and pride, since it was razor sharp. He approached the pallet, his granddaughter's voice. "Light the lamp, grandpaw." "Hit wont need no light, honey. Hit wont Holograph Working Draft Revised Complete Holograph take but a minute," he said, kneeling, fumbling, whispering now. "Where air you?" "Right here," she said fretfully. "What —" Then his hand touched her face. "Grandpaw!" she said. "Grand —" "Jones!" the man outside said. "Come out of there!" "In just a minute, Major," he said. Now he moved swiftly. He knew where in the dark the kerosene can was, just as he knew that it was full, since it was not 2 days back that he had fetched it home, [waiting for del. ] holding it at the store until he got a ride, since the 5 gallons were heavy. It took him no time at all to empty it; besides the rather crazy house itself was like tinder: the coals on the hearth, the walls, [seemed to del. ] exploded in a single blue glare against which the waiting men saw him in a wild instant springing toward them with the scythe in his hands before the horses reared and whirled. They checked the horses and turned them, yet still against the now blazing [hou del. ] shack the gaunt figure ran toward them, swinging the scythe. "Jones!" ["Wash! the Major shouted. "Stop!

"Hit's done been purified." del. ] "Jones!" the sheriff shouted; stop! Stop, or I'll shoot. Jones! Jones !" Yet still the gaunt, wild figure came on, against the furious glare of the blazing shack. With the scythe lifted it bore down upon them, upon the wild glinting eyes of the plunging horses and the last gleaming of gun barrels, without a word, without a sound.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WASH Sutpen stood above the pallet bed on which the mother and child lay. Between the shrunken planking of the wall the early sunlight fell in long pencil strokes, breaking upon his straddled legs and upon the riding whip in his hand, and lay across the still shape of the mother who lay looking up at him from still, inscrutable, sullen eyes, the child at her side wrapped in a piece of dingy though clean cloth. Behind them an old negro woman squatted beside the rough hearth where a meagre fire smoldered. "Well, Milly," Sutpen said, "too bad you're not a mare. Then I could give you a decent stall in the stable." Still the girl on the pallet did not move. She merely continued to look up at him without expression, with a young, sullen, inscrutable face still pale from recent travail. Sutpen moved, bringing into the splintered pencils of sunlight the face of a man of sixty. He said quietly to the squatting negress: "Griselda foaled this morning." "Horse or mare?" the negress said. "A horse. A damned fine colt-----What's this?" He indicated the pallet with the hand which held the whip. "That un's a mare, I reckon." "Hah," Sutpen said. "A damned fine colt. Going to be the spit and image of old Rob Roy when I rode him North in '61. Do you remember?" "Yes, Marster." "Hah." He glanced back toward 1 the pallet. None could have said if the girl still watched him or not. Again his whiphand indicated the pallet. "Do whatever they need with whatever we've got to do it with." He went out, passing out the crazy doorway and stepping down into the rank weeds (there yet leaned rusting against the corner of the porch the scythe which Wash had borrowed from him three months ago to cut them with) where the horse [was tethered. &lt;waited. del. &gt; Wash &lt;still del. &gt; was standing there, holding the reins in his hand. del .] waited, where Wash stood holding the reins. When Colonel Sutpen rode away to fight the Yankees, Wash didn't 2 go. "I'm looking after the Kernel's place and niggers," he would tell all who asked him and some who had not asked---a gaunt, malariaridden man with pale, questioning eyes, who looked about thirty-five though it was known that he had not only a daughter but an eight-year-old granddaughter as well. Which 3 was a lie, as most of them---the few remaining men between eighteen and fifty---to whom he told it, knew, though there were some who believed that he himself really believed it, though even these believed that he had better sense than to put it to the test with Mrs Sutpen or the Sutpen slaves. Knew better or was just too lazy and shiftless to try it, they said, knowing that his sole connection with the Sutpen plantation lay in the fact that for years now Colonel Sutpen had allowed him to squat in a crazy shack on a slough in 4 the river bottom on the Sutpen place, which Sutpen had built for a fishing lodge in his bachelor days and which had since fallen into 5 dilapidation from disuse so that now it looked like an aged or sick wild beast crawled terrifically there to drink in the act of dying. The Sutpen slaves themselves heard of his statement. They laughed. It was not the first time they had laughed at him, calling him white trash behind his back. They began to ask him themselves, in groups, meeting him in the faint road which led up from the slough and the old fish camp: "Why aint you at de war, white man?" Pausing, he would look about the ring of black faces and white eyes and teeth behind which derision lurked. "Because I got a daughter and family to keep," he said. "Git out of my road, niggers." "Niggers?" theτ repeated; "niggers?" laughing now. "Who him, calling us niggers?" "Yes," he said. "I aint got no niggers to look after my folks if I was gone." "Nor nothing else but dat shack down yon dat Cunnel wouldn't let none of us live in." Now he cursed them; sometimes he rushed at them, snatching up a stick from the ground while they scattered before him yet seeming to surround him still with that black laughing derisive, evasive, inescapable, leaving him panting and impotent and raging. Once it happened in the very back yard of the big house itself. This was after bitter news had come down from the Tennessee mountains and from Vicksburg and Sherman had passed through the plantation and most of the negroes had followed him. Almost everything else had gone with the Federal troops and Mrs Sutpen had sent word to Wash that he could have the scuppernongs ripening in the arbor in the back yard. This time it was a house servant, one of the few negroes who remained; this time the negress had to retreat up the kitchen steps, where she turned. "Stop right dar, white man. Stop right whar you is. You aint never crossed dese steps whilst Cunnel here, and you aint ghy do hit now." This was true. But there was this of a kind of pride: he had never tried to enter the big house, even though he believed that if he had, Sutpen would have received him, permitted him. 'But I aint going to give no black nigger the chance to tell me I cant go nowhere,' he told 6 himself. 'I aint even going to give Kernel the chance to have to cuss [one del .] a nigger on my account.' This, though he and Sutpen had spent more than one afternoon together on those rare Sundays when there would be no company in the house. Perhaps his mind knew that it was because Sutpen had nothing else to do, being a man who could not bear his own company. Yet the fact remained that the two of them would spend whole afternoons in the scuppernong arbor, Sutpen in the hammock and Wash squatting against a post, a pail of cistern water between them, taking drink for drink from the same demijohn. Meanwhile on week days he would see the fine figure of the man---they were the same age almost to a day, though neither of them (perhaps because Wash had a grandchild while Sutpen's son was a youth in school) ever thought of themselves 7 as being so---on the fine figure of the black stallion, galloping about the plantation. For that moment his heart would be quiet and proud. It would seem to him that that world in which negroes, whom the Bible told him had been created and cursed by God to be brute and vassal to all men of white skin, were better found and housed and even clothed than [him del .] &lt;he&gt; and his---that world in which he sensed always about him mocking echoes of black laughter---was but a dream and an illusion and that the actual world was this one across which his own lonely apotheosis seemed to gallop on the black thoroughbred, thinking how the Book said also that all men were created in the image of God and hence all men made the same image in God's eyes at least; so that he could say, as though speaking of himself: 'A fine proud man. If God Himself was to come down and ride the natural earth, that's what He would aim to look like.' Sutpen returned in 1865, on the black stallion. He seemed to have aged ten years. His son had been killed in action the same winter in which his wife had died. He returned with his citation for gallantry from the hand of General Lee to a ruined plantation, where for a year now his daughter had subsisted partially on the meagre bounty of the man to whom fifteen years ago he had granted permission to live in that tumbledown fishing camp whose very existence he had at the time forgot. 8 Wash was there to meet him, unchanged: still gaunt, still ageless, with his pale, questioning gaze, his air diffident, a little servile, a little familiar. "Well, Kernel," Wash said, "they kilt us but they aint whupped us yit, air they?" That was the tenor of their conversation for the next five years. It was inferior whiskey which they drank now together from a stoneware jug, and it was not in the scuppernong arbor. It was in the rear of the little store which Sutpen managed to set up on the highroad: a frame shelved room where with Wash for clerk and porter he dispensed kerosene and staple foodstuffs and stale gaudy candy and cheap beads and ribbons to negroes or poor whites of Wash's own kind, who came afoot or on gaunt mules to haggle tediously for dimes and quarters with the 9 man who at one time could gallop (the black stallion was still alive; the stable in which his [get del .] jealous get lived was in better repair than the house where the master himself lived) for ten miles across his own fertile land and who had led troops gallantly in battle; until Sutpen in fury would empty the store, close and lock the doors from the inside. Then he and Wash would repair to the rear and the jug. But the talk would not be quiet now, as when Sutpen lay in the hammock, delivering an arrogant monologue while Wash squatted guffawing against his post. They both sat now, though Sutpen had the single chair while Wash used whatever box or keg was handy, and even this for just a little while because soon Sutpen would reach that stage of impotent and furious undefeat in which he would rise, swaying and plunging, and declare again that he would take his pistol and the black stallion and ride singlehanded into Washington and kill Lincoln, dead now, and Sherman, now a private citizen. "Kill them!" he would shout. "Shoot them down like the dogs they are---------" "Sho, Kernel; sho, Kernel," Wash would say, catching Sutpen as he fell. Then he would commandeer the first passing wagon, or lacking that, he would walk the mile to the nearest neighbor and borrow one and return and carry Sutpen home. He entered the house now. He had been doing so for a long time, taking Sutpen home in whatever borrowed wagon, 10 talking him into locomotion with cajoling murmurs as though he were a horse, a stallion himself. The daughter would meet them and hold open the door without a word. He would carry his burden through the once white formal entrance surmounted by a fanlight imported piece by piece from Europe and with a board now nailed over a missing pane, across a velvet carpet from which all nap was now gone, and up a formal stairs where carpet, runner, was 11 now but a fading ghost of bare boards between two strips of fading paint, and into the bedroom. It would be dusk by now and he would let his burden sprawl onto the bed and undress it and then he would sit quietly in a chair beside. After a time the daughter would come to the door. "We're all right now," he would tell her. "Dont you worry none, Miss Judith." Then it would become dark and after a while he would lie down on the floor beside the bed, though not to sleep, because after a time---sometimes before midnight---the man on the bed would stir and groan and then speak: "Wash?" "Hyer I am, Kernel/.τ You go back to sleep. We aint whupped yit, air we? Me and you kin do hit." Even then he had already seen the ribbon about his granddaughter's waits.τ She was now fifteen, already mature, after the early way of her kind. He knew where the ribbon came from; he had been seeing it and its kind daily for three years, even if she had lied about where she got it, which she did not, at once bold, sullen, and fearful. "Sho now," he said. "Ef Kernel wants to give hit to you, I hope [d del .] you minded to thank him." His heart was quiet, even when he saw the dress, watching her secret, defiant, frightened face when she told him that [she del .] Miss Judith, the daughter, had helped her to make it. But he was quite grave when he approached Sutpen after they closed the store that afternoon, following the other to the rear. "Get the jug," Sutpen directed. "Wait," Wash said. "Not yit for a minute." Neither did Sutpen deny the dress. "What about it?" he said. But Wash met his arrogant stare; he spoke quietly. "I've knowed you for going on twenty years. I aint never yit denied to do what you told me to do. And I'm a man, nigh sixty. And she aint nothing but a fifteen-year-old gal." "Meaning that I'd harm a girl? I, a man as old as you are?" "If you was ara other man, I'd say you was as old as me. And old or no old, I wouldn't let her keep that dress nor nothing else that come from your hand. But you are different." "How different?" But Wash merely looked at him with his pale, questioning, sober eyes. "So that's why you are afraid of me?" Now Wash's gaze no longer questioned. It was tranquil, serene. "I aint afraid. Becaueτ you air brave. It aint that you were a brave man at one minute or day of your life and got a paper to show hit from General Lee. But you air brave, the same as you air alive and breathing. That's where hit's different. Hit dont need no ticket from nobody to tell me that. And I know that whatever you handle or tech, whether hits a regiment of men or a ignorant gal or just a hound dog, that you will make hit right." Now it was Sutpen who looked away, turning suddenly, brusquely. "Get the jug," he said sharply. "Sho, Kernel," Wash said. So 12 on that Sunday dawn two years later, having watched the negro midwife which he had walked three miles to fetch enter the crazy door beyond which his granddaughter lay wailing, his heart was still quiet though concerned. He knew what they had been saying---the negroes in cabins about the land, the white men who loafed all day long about the store, watching quietly the three of them: Sutpen, himself, his granddaughter with her air of brazen and shrinking defiance as her condition became daily more and more obvious, like three actors that came and went upon a stage. 'I know what they say to one another,' he thought. 'I can almost hyear them: Wash Jones has fixed old Sutpen at last. Hit taken him twenty years, but he has done hit at last' It would be dawn after a while, though not yet. From the house, where the lamp shown dim beyond the warped doorframe, his granddaughter's voice came steadily as though run by a clock, while thinking went slowly and terrifically, fumbling, involved somehow with a sound of galloping hooves, until there broke suddenly free in midgallop the fine proud figure of the man on the fine proud stallion, galloping; and then that at which thinking fumbled broke free too and quite clear, not in justification nor even explanation, but as the apotheosis, lonely, explicable, beyond all fouling by human touch: 'He is bigger than all them Yankees that kilt his son and his wife and taken his niggers and ruined his land, bigger than this hyer durn country that he fit for and that has denied him into keeping a little country store; bigger than the denial which hit helt to his lips like the bitter cup in the Book. And how could I have lived this nigh to him for twenty years without being teched and changed by him? Maybe I aint as big as him and maybe I aint done none of the galloping. But at least I done been drug along. Me and him kin do hit, if so be he will show me what he aims for me to do.' Then it was dawn. Suddenly he could see the house, and the old negress in the door looking at him. Then he realised that his granddaughter's voice had ceased. "It's a girl," the negress said. "You can go tell him if you want to." She reentered the house. "A girl," he repeated; "a girl"; in astonishment, hearing the galloping hooves, seeing the proud galloping figure emerge again. He seemed to watch it pass galloping through avatars which marked the accumulation of years, time, to the climax where it galloped beneath a brandished sabre and a shottorn flag rushing down a sky in color like thunderous sulphur, thinking for the first time in his life that perhaps Sutpen was an old man like himself. 'Gittin a gal,' he thought in that astonishment; then he thought with the pleased surprise of a child: 'Yes sir. Be dawg if I aint lived to be a great-grandpaw, after all.' He entered the house. He moved clumsily, on tiptoe, as if he no longer lived there, as if the infant which had just drawn breath and cried in light had dispossessed him, be it of his own blood too though it might. But even above the pallet he could see little save the blur of his granddaughter's [face del .] exhausted face. Then the negress squatting at the hearth spoke. "You better gawn tell him if you going to. Hit's daylight now." But this was not necessary. He had no more than turned the corner of the porch where the scythe leaned which he had borrowed three months ago to clear away the weeds through which he walked, when Sutpen himself rode up on the old stallion. He did not wonder how Sutpen had got the word. He took it for granted that this was what had brought the other out at this hour on Sunday morning, and he stood while the other dismounted and he took the reins from Sutpen's hand with on his gaunt face an expression almost 13 imbecile with a kind of weary triumph, saying, "Hit's a gal, Kernel. I be dawg if you aint as old as I am------" until Sutpen passed him and entered the house. He stood there with the reins in his hand and heard Sutpen cross the floor to the pallet. He heard what Sutpen said, and something seemed to stop dead in him before going on. The sun was now up, the swift sun of Mississippi latitudes, and it seemed to him that he stood beneath a strange sky, in a strange scene, familiar only as things are familiar in dream, like the dreams of falling to one who has never climbed. 'I kaint have heard what I thought I heard,' he thought quietly. 'I know I kaint.' Yet the voice, the familiar voice which had said the words was still speaking, talking now to the old negress about a colt foaled that morning. 'That's why he was up so early,' he thought. 'That was hit. Hit aint me and mine. Hit aint even hisn that got him outen bed.' Sutpen emerged. He descended into the weeds, moving with that heavy deliberation which would have been haste when he was younger. He had not yet looked full at Wash. He said, "Dicey will stay and tend to her. You better-------" Then he seemed to see Wash facing him; he 14 paused. "What?" he said. You said-------" To his own ears Wash's voice sounded flat and ducklike, like a deaf man's. "You said if she was a mare, you could give her a good stall in the stable." "Well?" Sutpen said. His eyes widened and narrowed, almost like a man's fists flexing and shutting, as Wash began to advance toward 1a him, stopping a little. Very astonishment kept Sutpen still for the moment, watching that man whom in twenty years he had [never del. ] &lt;no more&gt; known to make any motion save at command than he had the horse which he rode. Again his eyes narrowed and widened; without moving he seemed to rear suddenly upright. "Stand back," he said [. del .] suddenly and sharply. "Dont you touch me." "I'm going to tech you, Kernel," Wash said in that flat, quiet, almost soft voice, advancing. Sutpen raised the hand which held the riding whip; [At that moment del .] the old negress peered around the crazy door with her black gargoyle face of a worn gnome. "Stand back, Wash," Sutpen said. Then he struck. The old negress leaped down into the weeds with the agility of a goat, and fled. Sutpen slashed Wash again across the face with the whip, striking him to his knees. When he rose and advanced once more he held in his hands the scythe which he had borrowed from Sutpen three months ago and which Sutpen would never need again. When he reentered the house his granddaughter stirred on the pallet bed and called his name fretfully. "What was that?" she said. "What was what, honey?" "That ere racket out there." "'Twarn't nothing," he said gently. He knelt and touched her hot forehead clumsily. "Do you want ara thing?" "I want a sup of water," she said querulously. "I been laying here wanting a sup of water a long time, but dont nobody care enough to pay me no mind." "Sho now," he said soothingly. He rose stiffly and fetched the dipper of water and raised her head to drink and laid her back and watched her turn to the child with an absolutely 15 stonelike face. But a moment later he saw that she was crying quietly. "Now, now," he said; "I wouldn't do that. Old Dicey says hit's a right fine gal. Hit's all right now. Hit's all over now. Hit aint no need to cry now." But she continued to cry quietly, almost sullenly, and he rose again and stood uncomfortably above the pallet for a time, thinking as he had thought when his own wife lay so and then his daughter in turn: 'Women. Hit's a mystery 16 to me. they † seem to want em, and yit when they git em they cry about hit. Hit's a mystery 16 to me. To ara man.' Then he moved away and drew a chair up to the window and sat down. Through all that long, bright, sunny forenoon he sat at the window, waiting. Now and then he rose and tiptoed to the pallet. But his granddaughter slept now, her face sullen and calm and weary, the child in the crook of her arm. Then he returned to the chair and sat again, waiting, wondering for a time 17 why it took them so long until he remembered that it was Sunday. He was sitting there at midafternoon when a halfgrown white boy came around the corner of the house upon the body and gave a choked cry and looked up and glared for a mesmerised instant at Wash in the window before he turned and fled. Then Was † rose and tiptoed again to the pallet. The granddaughter was awake now, wakened perhaps by the boy's cry without hearing it. "Milly," he said, "air you hungry?" She didn't answer, turning her face away. He built up the fire on the hearth and cooked the food which he had brought home the day before: fatback it was, and cold corn pone; he poured water into the stale coffe † pot and heated it. But she would not eat when he carried the plate to her, so he ate himself, quietly, alone, and left the dishes as they were and returned to the window. Now he seemed to sense, feel, the men who would be gathering with horses and guns and dogs---the curious, and the vengeful: men of Sutpen's own kind, who had made the company about his 18 table in the time when he 19 had yet to approach nearer to the house than the scuppernong arbor---men who had also shown the lesser ones how to fight in battle, who maybe also had signed papers from the generals saying that they were among the first of the brave; who had also galloped in the old days arrogant and proud on the fine horses across the fine plantations---symbols also of admiration and hope; instruments too of despair and grief. That was who they would expect him to run from. It seemed to him that he had no more to run from than he had to run to. If he ran, he would merely be fleeing one set of bragging and evil shadows for another just like them, since they were all of a kind throughout all the earth which he knew and he was old, too old to flee far even if he were to flee. He could never escape them [. del. ], no matter how much or how far he ran: a man going on sixty could not run that far. Not far enough to escape beyond the boundaries of earth where such men lived, set the order and the rule of living. It seemed to him that he now saw for the first time, after five years, how it was that Yankees or any other living armies had managed to whip them: the gallant, the proud, the brave; the acknowledged and chosen best among them all to carry courage and honor and pride. Maybe if he had gone to the war with them, he would have discovered them sooner. But if he had discovered them sooner, what would he have done with his life since? how † could he have borne to remember for five years what his life had been before? Now it was getting toward sunset. The child had been crying; when he went to the pallet he saw his granddaughter nursing it, her face still bemused, sullen, inscrutable. "Air you hungy † yit?" he said. "I dont want nothing." "You ought to eat." This time she did not answer at all, looking down at the child. He returned to his chair and found that the sun had set. 'Hit kaint be much longer,' he thought. He could feel them quite near now, the curious and the vengeful. He could even seem to hear what they were saying about him, the undercurrent of believing beyond the immediate fury: Old Wash Jones he come a tumble at last. He thought he had Sutpen but Sutpen fooled him. He thought he had Kernel where he would have to marry the gal or pay up. And Kernel refused † "But I never expected that, Kernel!" he cried aloud, catching himself at the sound of his own voice, glancing quickly back to find his granddaughter watching him. "Who are 20 you talking to now?" she said. "Hit aint nothing. I was just thinking and talked out before I knowed hit." Her face was becoming indistinct again, again a sullen blur in the twilight. "I reckon so. I reckon you'll have to holler louder than that before he'll hear you [. del. ], up yonder at that house. And I reckon you'll need to do more than holler before you get him down here, too." "Sho now," he said. "Dont you worry none." But already thinking was going smoothly on: 'You know I never. You know how I aint never expected [nothing del. ] or asked nothing from ara living man but what I expected from you. And I never asked that. I didn't think hit would need. I said, I dont need to. What need has a fellow like Wash Jones to question or doubt the man that General Lee himself says in a handwrote [ note del.] ticket that he was brave ? Brave,' τ'he thought. 'Better if nara one of them had ever 21 rid back home in '65'; thinking Better if his kind and mine too had never drawn the breath of life on this earth. Better that all who remain of us be blasted from the face of earth than that another Wash Jones should see his whole life shredded from him and shrivel away like a dried shuck thrown onto the fire † He ceased, became still. He heard the horses, suddenly and plainly; presently he saw the lantern and the movement of men, the glint of gun barrels, in its moving light. Yet he did not [move del. ] &lt;stir&gt;. It was quiet dark now and he listened to the voices and the sounds of underbrush as they surrounded the house. The lantern itself came on; its light fell upon the quiet body in the weeds and stopped, the horses tall and shadowy. A man descended and stooped in the lantern, 22 above the body. He held a pistol; he rose and faced the house. "Jones," he said. "I'm here," Wash said quietly from the window. "That you, Major?" "Come out." "Sho," he said quietly. "I just want to see to my granddaughter." "We'll see to her. Come on out." "Sho, Major. Just a minute." "Show a light. Light your lamp." "Sho. In just a minute." They could hear his voice retreat into the house, though they could not tell what he was doing. They could not 23 see him as he went swiftly and unerringly 24 to the crack in the chimney where he kept the butcher knife: the one thing in his sloven life and house in which he took pride, since it was razor sharp. He approached the pallet, his granddaughter's voice: "Who is it? Light the lamp, grandpaw." "Hit wont need no light, honey. Hit wont take but a minute," he said, kneeling, fumbling toward her voice, whispering now. "Where air you?" "Right here," she said fretfully. "Where would I be? What is------" His hand touched her face. "What is-----Grandpaw! Grand--------" "Jones!" the sheriff said. "Come out of there!" "In just a minute, Major," he said. Now he rose and moved swiftly. He knew where in the dark the can of kerosene was, just as he knew that it was full, since it was not two days ago that he had filled it at the store and held it there until 25 he got a ride home with it, since the five gallons were heavy. There were still coals on the hearth; besides the crazy building itself was like tinder: the coals, the hearth, the walls exploded 26 in a single blue glare. Against it the waiting men saw him in a wild instant springing toward them with the lifted scythe before the horses reared and whirled. They checked the horses and turned them back toward the glare, yet still in [savage del. ] wild relief against it the gaunt figure ran toward them with the lifted scythe. "Jones!" the sheriff shouted; "stop! Stop, or I'll shoot. Jones! Jones ! † Yet still the gaunt, furious figure came on against the glare and roar of the flames. With the scythe lifted it bore down upon them, upon the wild glaring eyes of the horses and the swinging glints of gun barrels, without any cry, any sound. The following collation between the typescript and Harper's lists only the substantive variants, some of which are undoubtedly Faulkner's own revisions in the hypothesized lost typescript that he made to serve as printer's copy but some of which may also represent editorial interposition. The accidentals variants have been omitted since they would normally represent the markings of the Harper's copyreader, with the odds against very many going back to variants in the lost typescript. Specialists interested in these variants can readily recover them from the Harper's print. However, the substantive variants are provided here for their inherent interest to readers as affecting the final form of the story in the magazine. For convenience, the substantive variants have been keyed to numbered references in the text. As a space-saver, and an attempt to avoid the recording of the obvious, a superior dagger in the text indicates a typescript error that was automatically corrected in the magazine version and is not listed in the collation. The reading to the left of the bracket is that of the typescript: to the right the reading is that of Harper's .</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Setting and Printing of the First Edition of Cervantes's Novelas Ejemplares by R. M. Flores</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first editions of Don Quixote , Part I (1605), Novelas ejemplares (1613), Don Quixote , Part II (1615), and Persiles y Sigismunda (1617) were printed at the Madrid press of the widow of Pedro Madrigal, which in those years was under the direction of Juan de la Cuesta. 1 Of these four Cuesta assignments, the setting and printing of the first edition of Novelas ejemplares was in most respects the smoother and more straight-forward job. For example, with the exception of only eight pages (out of a total of five Type Occurrences B K3, 4; O5v, 22; S7v, 1; T1v, 26; V1v, 18; X6v, 16; Y5v, 18; Bb4v, 21; Cc4, 7; Ee2, 18; Ff8v, 27; Gglv, 34; Hh7, 23 C A3, 15; B2v, 8; H1, 13; I7, 6; K3, 25 C A6, 20; F1v, 17; G3, 15; O2v, 19; R8, 18; T5v, 17; V8v, 9; Y7, 6; Z8, 8; Aa1, 1; Bb7v, 14; Cc5, signature; Gg4v, 30; Hh6, 5; Kk6, 13; Ll4, 14; Mm1, 21 C D4v, 8; E7v, 34; G5, 31; N5, 12; X6, 27; Z6, 3; Bb5v, 23; Cc6v, 2; Dd6v, 10; Ee3v, 28; Ff6, 28 C Ff1, 21; Hh8v, 31; Mm1v, 30 D Bb6v, 21; Ee5, 27 E Y2, 3; Z8, 19; Aa2v, 8; Dd6v, 23; Ee4, signature; Ff5v, 20; Gg3, 31; Hh5v, 17; Ii3v, 16 E B7, 27; D5v, 20; M8, 14; N4v, 32; O5v, 27; T8, 6; Z8v, 9; Aa7v, 4; Ff8v, 6 E B7v, 16; C5v, 14; D3, 20; O4v, 24; P5, 9; Q4, 27; S1v, 13; Y3v, 7; Z8, 5; Aa2v, 4; Bb7, 22 E Ll5v, 22; ¶¶2, 27 G Q1v, 6; V1v, 4; Kk1v, 12 H B1, 25; D4v, 15; E7v, 31; F7v, 21; G8, 12; H5, 22 M A3, 33; G5v, 10 M G6v, 22; K8, 13; L6v, 28; M2, signature; O3, 28; T6v, 32; X1v, 9; Dd2v, 9; Gg4, 29; Ll4v, 34 M Ff2v, 14; Gg8, 7; Hh2, 34; Ii8, 12; Ll8v, 32; ¶¶7v, 17 N A7v, 5; D6v, 23; H6, 19; I7v, 9; L4, 18; M6, 33; N8v, 16; P1, 32; Q8, 22; R2v, 27 O A8v, 33; B7v, 24 Large P C1, 26; L2, 16; ¶3, 26 T P3v, 31; Z1, 18; Ff6v, 8; Hh6, 28 V A6v, 25; B1v, 1; C6v, 16 Y T5, 9; V6, 4; X4v, 24; Y4, 24; Aa2v, 11; Cc7, 1 Table 1. Recurrences of some distinctive types in the gatherings of the first edition of Novelas ejemplares . hundred and seventy-one pages—page ¶lv is blank) all other pages of this work were composed from the same set of type cases; see Table 1. 2 Table 1 contains only a small sample of the dozens of types which could be used to show that only one set of type cases was used throughout most of the job (I shall return to the eight irregular pages later on), but I have listed only those types which are easy to spot and identify and which together interrelate all the gatherings with each other. Another telling characteristic is the relatively small number of running titles used in this edition. In the following table I have entered the running titles per forme and entered the formes according to the order in which they were usually completed. This order, however, does not necessarily obey the sequence in which the formes were printed; but on the whole the order of printing followed the order in which the formes were completed. Pages A1, I2, L7, Q6, V6v, Dd4, and Gg1 have no running title. Table 2 shows that only seventeen running titles were used, and that of these running titles only four do not appear throughout the book: running title a (first appears in gathering E), running title b (appears last in gathering Q), running title i (appears last in gathering F), and running title q (first appears in gathering D). I did not include gatherings ¶, ¶¶, and Mm in the table because gatherings ¶ and ¶¶ have no running titles, and because gathering Mm has only four pages: pages Mm1 and Mm2v made up the outer forme, and pages Mm1v and Mm2 the inner forme (page Mm1 has running title a, page Mm1v has running title d, page Mm2 has running title m, and page Mm2v has no running title). With the help of Table 2 we can follow in some degree the way in which the job advanced. It is evident that even though some running titles appear in consecutive formes (running title d, for instance, appears on signatures A2v and B3v—last forme of gathering A and first forme of gathering B), or fail to appear for a period of time (running title m appears on signature E4, does not appear in gatherings F or G, and reappears on signature H8), the more common sequences have from one to four formes in between occurrences of the same running title (running title m, signatures A7 and B3; running title i, signatures B2 and C3; running title n, signatures A7v and B7v; running title g, signatures A4 and B5). The periodicity in which the running titles alternate from the beginning to the end of the alphabetical sequence of gatherings clearly shows that the printing of this work was for the most part uneventful. The periodic reappearances of any given running title are, of course, neither predictable nor regular, but it is evident from Table 2 that the setting of type, and the imposing and running off of the formes was a steady process devoid of most of the complex setting and printing patterns one finds in other works printed at the Madrigal-Cuesta press. A third helpful aid is the striking orthographic consistency one is faced with throughout the first edition of Novelas ejemplares . Some examples: I found eighty-eight occurrences of the spelling variant vuessa merced and thirty-seven abbreviations (v.m., thirty-four occurrences; vs.ms. three occurrences), but I found no occurrence of the spelling variant vuestra merced , which was the other common spelling used for this form of address. 3 Moreover, the thirty-seven abbreviations were clearly meant to stand for the form vuessa merced , because whenever the word vuestra appears abbreviated it appears set as vrtildea. (vrtildea., thirteen occurrences; vrtildeas., five occurrences; vrtildeo., twelve occurrences; vrtildeos., six occurrences), never as v. alone. The only exceptions to this thoroughly consistent rule are the abbreviations used for the forms of address vuestra Excelencia, vuestra Magestad , and vuestra Señoria which appear abbreviated with upper-case V's ( V. Excelencia , one occurrence; V. Magestad , eight occurrences; and V. Señoria , three occurrences). One could argue that these upper-case V's might stand for the form vuessa or Vuessa , but the text is perfectly clear in this respect. In my article "The Need for a Scholarly, Modernized Edition" I suggested that in all probability Cervantes used the form vuestra in these and other related forms of address, except when he was making sport of one of his characters; the text of Novelas ejemplares bears this theory out. Whenever any of the forms of address just mentioned above does not appear abbreviated it invariably occurs in conjunction with the form vuestra , with lower-case v ( vuestra Excelencia , five occurrences; vuestra Magestad , six occurrences; and, too, vuestra Alteza , one occurrence; vuestra Christiandad , one occurrence). And I found no instance of an improper spelling of any of these forms of address because at no time are any of them used in a sarcastic or humorous vein, as some of them are on occasions used in Don Quixote . 4 Two other examples of this orthographic consistency: there are four hundred occurrences of the word volver (to return) and related forms, of which three hundred and ninety-seven occurrences follow the spelling boluer and only three the spelling voluer (which in all probability were caused by the compositors' using foul-case types). There are three hundred and eleven occurrences of the word misma (same) and related forms, all of which follow the spelling misma , vis-à-vis mesma ; and yet we know that Cervantes used both spellings because they appear in his other works side by side. This remarkable orthographic consistency and the fact that only one set of type cases was used throughout most of the job strongly suggest that the entire setting of the first edition of Novelas ejemplares was assigned to one compositor. One of the more reliable methods for finding out whether or not this theory is sound is to obtain the overall quadmark of the work. The following table shows the numbers of quads set before punctuation marks per page in this work. 5 There might be, and probably are, some minor differences between the numbers noted in Table 3 and the actual numbers of quads per page because at times I found it very difficult to tell with all certitude whether or not there is a space between a word and the following punctuation mark, and because all occurrences had to be collated by hand. But these minor discrepancies would not modify in any substantial way the general conclusions I shall draw from this typographical evidence. When in the following table only one figure is entered under any given page it indicates the number of quads set before commas in that page (see, for example, page A6v; two quads set before commas). When two figures are given, the second one indicates the number of quads set before other punctuation marks rather than comma (page A1; one quad set before a comma and three quads set before other punctuation marks). When we add up the full pages of type that have the same number of quads set before punctuation marks and project the various totals over a horizontal guide line ("Quads per page") we obtain the overall compositorial quadmark, which in this instance is a double-peak curve (Diagram 1). 6 I have argued elsewhere that a double-peak quadmark is likely to result if we have insufficient data, if we consider the work of two different compositors together, if we mix pages set seriatim and pages set from cast-off copy together, or if we have any combinations of these conditions (see "The Compositors", pp. 35-36). The first possibility should be discarded outright. The typographical evidence we have in this instance is both sufficient and conclusive. The possibility that more than one Cuesta man might have set copy for the first edition of Novelas ejemplares cannot, on the other hand, be rejected without first entering into an in-depth study of the text. I have already pointed out that typographical (one set of cases, a relatively small number of running titles) and textual (orthographic consistency) evidence strongly suggest that the entire setting of this edition was assigned to one compositor, but, of course, this theory does not necessarily imply that the job was set by one workman alone. Compositors could either work on their own, in teams but independently from one another (compositors C and D, and compositors E and F; Don Quixote , Part I), in a closer team relationship (compositor I and apprentice Z; Don Quixote , Part II), or in more complex patterns ( Don Quixote , Parts I and II). Hence, and in order to ascertain exactly how many men worked on the setting of the first edition of Novelas ejemplares , I shall now delve into the text of this work of Cervantes's. Despite the striking orthographic consistency one finds throughout the pages of this book, this uniformity is by no means an out-and-out phenomenon. One can find scores of spelling variants in Novelas ejemplares , just as I have found them in the first editions of Cervantes's other works, but, unlike in my previous monographs, I cannot base my study of orthographic variants on frequently used words ( vuesa/vuestra, bolver/volver, mesma/misma ) because either these words occur in only one spelling or the occurrences of a differing spelling are so few that the different readings might be merely the result of the compositor's setting foul-case types accidentally. I have, therefore, relied solely on words that show few occurrences, keeping in mind the following premises: 1) many of the variants could be authorial and might have been entered deliberately by Cervantes for stylistic purposes, 7 2) this sort of variants cannot be always trusted because the fewer occurrences one has of any given variant the less reliable one's conclusions might result, 8 and 3) compositors were not always one hundred per cent consistent in their spellings when they set unfrequently used words and often changed from one spelling to another in the midst of a job. 9 In spite of these obvious drawbacks, I was able to find twelve words that can be used to demonstrate that the first edition of Novelas ejemplares was set by more than one workman. (In Table 4, pages that appear within blocks have fourteen or more quads set before punctuation marks per page). The parting of the twelve spelling variants listed in Table 4 into two clearly defined groups according to whether the pages where they occur have thirteen or fewer or fourteen or more quads set before punctuation marks per page proves that the first edition of Novelas ejemplares was set by two workmen. Moreover, because most of the preferred spellings of these Cuesta men were so similar, and because both men worked in the same gatherings together and used the same cases of type and the same running titles we can safely conclude that they were a team made up of a compositor and his apprentice. It is now obvious that the Cuesta hand whose habit it was to set quads before punctuation marks whether or not they were needed preferred the spellings agradecelle, agradecida, agradecimiento, alfange, accidente, banco, bulto, continuo, efecto, encaxar, huesso, monja, Precetor , and Tiniente ; whereas his co-worker preferred the spellings agradezelle, agradezida, agradezimiento, alfanje, acidente, vanco, vulto, contino, efeto, encajar, hueso, Monja, preceptor , and Teniente . 10 But the latter, who was probably the instructor, was not as consistent in his use of these spellings (see especially variants 1, 10, and 12) as he was with the spellings of more frequently used words, a fact that would explain why the apprentice was able to introduce his own preferred spellings (or retain those of the printer's copy) without being brought to account for it. The next step is to identify these workmen by comparing some of their preferred spellings of frequently used words to those of the compositors who set the first edition of Don Quixote . And here, what had been a stumbling block when trying to distinguish between the compositor and his apprentice, i.e., the striking similarities between most of their spelling preferences, suddenly becomes an invaluable asset. In Table 5, I have listed some readings, most of which appear in the stints of compositors C and D (first edition of Don Quixote , Part I), E (first and second Madrid editions of Don Quixote , Part I), F (first and second Madrid editions of Don Quixote , Part I, and first edition of Don Quixote , Part II), and H, I (with apprentice Z), and J (first edition of Don Quixote , Part II), and in the first edition of Novelas ejemplares . I have indicated with x's the preferred spellings of the various compositors. The numbers of occurrences that we find in Novelas ejemplares appear in the last column under a question mark. When I could not be certain about which variant form was the preferred spelling of a given compositor I left the appropriate spaces blank. For instance, compositor J set only one occurrence of the form apenas (Ee3, 30) and one occurrence of the form a penas (Ll1, 3); hence neither occurrence was entered in the table. Most departures from the preferred spellings used in Novelas ejemplares (see, for example, variant 6, last column, three occurrences of the form cauallero ) are either foul-case variants (variant 6: Andres cauallero , E5, 4; Cauallero is a proper name and should have been capitalized, and the compositors were aware of this fact—nine previous occurrences were capitalized: B5v, 34; B8, 17; B8v, 9; C2v, 3; C3, 6; C7, 17; D4, 5; D8, 17; and E2v, 24), authorial variants (variant 6: Cervantes uses the words señor cauallero —with which Rinconete addresses Cortadillo, I2v, 17—and esse cauallero —with which Cortadillo refers to the scoundrel Monipodio, I7v, 28—ironically; see above, footnote 4), or compositorial variants (see the variant encaxar/encajar ; Table 4 [variant 8] and Table 5 [variant 17]). Variants in capitalization do not include occurrences of homographs unless the homographs themselves have variants. For example: in variant 6, Cauallero/cauallero (gentleman) I have not included occurrences of the word cauallero (mounted), but in variant 22, Sol(es)/ſol(es) (sun) I have included the homograph Soles/soles (eyes) because both words have variants. When we tabulate the overall dominant spellings listed in the last column of Table 5 (variant 6, Cauallero ; variant 16, efecto ; variant 17, encaxar ; etc.) with the dominant spellings of the compositors of Don Quixote we find that the compositors of the first edition of Novelas ejemplares disagree with the preferred spellings of: compositor C in variants: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 22, 23, and 27. compositor D in variants: 1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 11, 16, 19, 21, 22, 23, and 27. compositor E in variants: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22, and 24. compositor F in variants: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 26. compositor H in variants: 1, 5, 11, 15, 16, 19, 21, 22, and 25. compositor I in variants: 1, 5, 7, 14, 19, 21, 23, 24, and 26. compositor J in variants: 1, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, and 26. It is therefore evident that neither of the compositors of Novelas ejemplares was one of the Cuesta men who worked on the first editions of Don Quixote . The differences between the preferred spellings of the compositors are too clear to cause any uneasiness, especially because the majority of the words listed in Table 5 were selected only because they appear in the stints of all or of most of the compositors. I could list dozens of other words which show orthographic differences between only two or three compositors at a time (see variant 9), but I would be merely stressing what is already obvious. I therefore shall from now on refer to the Cuesta hand who set substantial numbers of quads before punctuation marks in the pages of Novelas ejemplares as apprentice Y, and to his instructor as compositor K. We can now confidently state that compositor K's normal range of quads set before punctuation marks was from five to eleven quads per page, with a peak at between seven and nine occurrences per page (see Diagram 2). And after examining some of the pages set by compositor K we can conclude that he usually set tight full lines of type with narrow spaces between words and punctuation marks ("Gitanif | mo,y la mas hermofa,y difcreta, que pudiera hallarfe,no | entre", A1, 16-18), that he set very few quads per page, and that he used them mainly to justify his lines and normally placed them between words and after punctuation marks ("bufcô | por todas las vias que pudo, y no faltò poeta que fe los | dieffe", A1v, 19-21). The normal range of quads set before punctuation marks of apprentice Y was from fourteen to thirty-six quads per page, with a peak at between nineteen and twenty-three occurrences per page, but his overall range goes from zero quads set before punctuation marks (pages containing poems or sections of poems; compositors did not usually set unnecessary quads when setting poetry) to fifty-four or more quads per page (see Diagram 2). It was the habit of apprentice Y to spread-out normal lines of type by leaving wide blank spaces between words and before and after punctuation marks. He frequently set unnecessary quads when setting prose ("f;intieſ- | ſe : mas quando boluí de mi deſmayo , y me vi ſolo | en", F4v, 20-22). It seems to me unlikely that compositor K might have set many pages with more than sixteen quads before punctuation marks, at least in this job. 11 On the other hand I am almost certain that apprentice Y set a substantial number of pages with fewer than fourteen quads before punctuation marks, but I hesitate to separate the different stints, mainly because they do not always coincide with the printed pages as we now have them; for example, page F4v has thirty-seven quads set before punctuation marks, and the first nineteen lines of page F5 have twenty-one quads (probably all set by apprentice Y), but the last fifteen lines of page F5 have only three quads, and page F5v has only six quads (compositor K?). Nevertheless, I find quadmarks a very reliable tool for verifying overall compositorial patterns because setting, or not setting, quads before punctuation marks was a mechanical compositorial habit which had nothing to do with the characteristics of the printer's copy of works in prose. On the basis of the typographical evidence provided by the marked differences in the numbers of quads set before punctuation marks per page and of the textual evidence provided by the spelling variants listed in Table 4 we can also begin assigning to one or to the other workman some readings that show few occurrences. For example, the readings vagage (one occurrence, page P1, 5; thirty-six quads), ropage (one occurrence, page Kk1, 29; sixteen quads), barco (one occurrence, page V7v, 21; twenty-two quads), and raxa (one occurrence, page G5, 14; fourteen quads) agree with the preferred spellings of apprentice Y for the readings alfange, banco , and encaxar (Table 4, variants 2, 4, and 8). And a similar pattern emerges from the spellings preferred by compositor K: the readings vagaje (one occurrence, page D8, 27; eight quads), varco (one occurrence, page N1v, 21; thirteen quads), and raja (two occurrences, pages S4, 7, and Y5, 25; five and zero quads respectively), agree with the related spellings set by compositor K, alfanje, vanco , and encajar (Table 4, variants 2, 4, and 8). Furthermore, we are now able to pinpoint some compositorial variants even when the readings occur on pages which could not be assigned to one or to the other Cuesta man solely on the basis of the numbers of quads set before punctuation marks. The word satanás (Satan), for instance, appears in Novelas ejemplares with two different spellings: Satanas (B4v, 33; and Ll6v, 19) and Sathanas (L5v, 19; P5, 18; and V1, 32). Because all five occurrences of this word appear on pages each of which has less than fourteen quads set before punctuation marks (B4v, seven quads; L5v, thirteen quads; P5, eight quads; V1, thirteen quads; and Ll6v, nine quads) we could have mistakenly assumed that all occurrences had been set by compositor K, and, thus, that his preferred spelling was the form Sathanas simply because there are three occurrences of this form and only two of the form Satanas . But now that we know that apprentice Y had some strong spelling preferences of his own we can safely conclude: 1) that the different forms of the word satanás are not the result of the compositors' changing spellings at midstream, 2) that the spelling difference between the two forms (-t-, -th-) could not have arisen accidentally, 3) that the preferred spelling of compositor K was Sathanas whilst the preferred spelling of apprentice Y was Satanas , and 4) that apprentice Y did indeed set some pages with less than fourteen quads before punctuation marks. Once we are certain that the workmen who set the first edition of Novelas ejemplares can be told apart and identified through some of their spelling preferences and the number of quads they set before punctuation marks per page, we can begin putting other pieces of this typographical puzzle into place. Now I shall address myself to the questions of whether or not some pages, or gatherings, might have been set from cast-off copy, and, if so, whether or not this fact would modify the quadmarks of compositor K and apprentice Y. When manuscript copy of a work in prose is cast off compositors almost always receive slightly less or slightly more text than they would otherwise set in their stints when setting seriatim. On such occasions compositors frequently have to depart from some of their usual setting practices in order to make the text of the cast-off copy fit their stints, and must resort to some common tricks of the trade. According to whether they find themselves with less copy than necessary or too much text, the compositors would set either looser or tighter lines of type than usual, impose shorter or longer pages than the average page of the work, set additional or avoid unnecessary rules and quads, and/or develope or use contractions and abbreviations. Pages of type with an irregular width or length should therefore be examined closely, especially when they occur in groups. Such is the case, for example, with pages C3 to C6v. These pages belong to, and exactly make up the two formes of the inner sheet of gathering C, and they are four millimetres wider (102 mm) than the average page of the first edition of Novelas ejemplares . Also, page C4 is the only page in the whole book which has more lines of type (thirty-five lines) than the average page (thirty-four lines). These typographical characteristics cannot be regarded as mere coincidences. They strongly suggest that the pages of the inner sheet of gathering C were set from cast-off copy. What in all probability happened is that compositor K must have found himself lagging behind the pressmen when he was working on gathering C, and must have decided to complete the two formes of the outer sheet first. That way he had to set only eight pages (C1 to C2v and C7 to C8v) rather than the twelve pages (C1 to C6v) he would have had to set to complete two formes set seriatim. Thus, when he finished setting page C2v he apparently cast off copy for pages C3 to C6v, put it aside, and began setting page C7. Once he had finished setting the pages of the outer sheet either he or his apprentice imposed them and gave the formes to the pressmen. Then compositor K returned to the cast-off copy and began setting the pages of the inner sheet. When he finished setting the text he found himself with some twelve extra lines of type, and, because the formes of the outer sheet either had already been run off or were in the process of being printed, he had to absorb the extra lines in the pages he had just finished. It is self-evident that the compositor absorbed the extra lines by increasing the length of his lines of type by four millimetres each and making an irregular page of thirty-five lines of type. 12 Another typographical characteristic that seems to support this theory is the substantial numbers of contractions set in these pages (three hundred and eighty-nine contractions altogether), but to explain this anomaly I must refer to gathering E, where most of the recourses resorted to by compositors when they found themselves with extra lines of type were used (see Table 6). Despite the considerable differences between the numbers of quads set per page in gathering E (from two quads—page E2—to twenty-eight—page E4v), we must consider all the pages of this gathering regular in this respect because the numbers of quads are well within the extended ranges of compositor K and apprentice Y. These variations, therefore, have very little to do, if any, with whether the workmen were setting seriatim or from cast-off copy. The irregularities between the numbers of contractions used from page to page are so marked (from zero to forty-two) that they must necessarily reflect some variable conditions of one sort or another. 13 These variations are especially puzzling because they occur throughout the book and in a very irregular sequence where isolated pages, or groups of pages, with few contractions per page alternate with pages or groups of pages with many contractions (see Table 7). At first I thought that these variations in the numbers of contractions per page revealed another compositorial trademark, that one Cuesta man did not like to use contractions whereas his companion used them frequently. But what in fact seems to have happened is that the main type case used to set the first edition of Novelas ejemplares had only sufficient type to set about nine or ten full pages of text without becoming short of some of the sorts most often used (a's, e's, o's, and n's). 14 Thus, the compositor (probably compositor K) was able to set pages A1 to A7 (thirteen pages, but the majority of these pages are not full pages of type; they contain the beginning of La Gitanilla —one half page of type—and three long poems) without worrying, but when he was setting page A7v he began to be short of n's (fifteen of the nineteen contractions set in this page stand for n's) even though type from the first forme ran off (A3v, A4, A5v, and A6) had apparently already been washed and was being distributed. As soon as the clean type was added to his case the compositor immediately returned to his usual practice (lines 30 to 33 of page A7v have no contractions; page A8 has only three contractions.) 15 The running off of the formes and the washing and distribution of type kept pace with compositor K until he reached the middle of page B8 (lines 1 to 22 have only four contractions; lines 23 to 31 have seventeen). 16 (It is important to notice that pages A8 to B7v make a total of sixteen pages, exactly four formes of type.) As compositor K was finishing page B8, however, he must have received clean type from a previous forme (lines 32 to 34 of page B8 do not have any contractions) and was thus able to set the equivalent of four full pages of type (pages B8v, C1, C1v, and C2—pages C1 to C2 are not full pages because they contain two short poems—and the first half of page C2v—lines 1 to 15 have only eight contractions) without having to set more contractions than was his usual custom. But he realized then that some sorts were becoming scarce and began setting more contractions than usual (lines 16 to 34 of page C2v have twenty contractions). As long as distribution of type and composition kept pace with one another (pages A1 to C2) the compositor was replenishing his case with type coming from formes which had very few contractions (for example, the outer forme of the outer sheet of gathering A—A1, A2v, A7, and A8v—has only five contractions), but whenever composing out-paced distribution the compositor was forced to use more contractions per page (forme) and hence he began receiving clean type from formes whose numbers of contractions varied greatly from one to the other (for instance, the outer forme of the outer sheet of gathering C— C1, C2v, C7, and C8v—has one hundred contractions; the inner forme of the inner sheet of gathering C—C3v, C4, C5v, and C6—has two hundred and seven contractions, the outer forme of the outer sheet of gathering D—D1, D2v, D7, and D8v—has only twenty-seven contractions). Consequently, one would look in vain for the regular pattern of full pages of type with few contractions based on the number four (number of pages per forme) or multiples of four (two formes = eight pages; etc.) to continue beyond the first few gatherings. Nor is there any relationship between numbers of quads set before punctuation marks and numbers of contractions set per page. There is, on the other hand, a close relationship between the numbers of contractions and abbreviations set per page. We have already seen that compositor K and apprentice Y set relatively few abbreviations of the form of address vuesa merced . If we collate the pages where most of these abbreviations occur with the pages that contain substantial numbers of contractions we will find out, not surprisingly, that of the forty-four pages with abbreviations thirty-five have more than ten contractions per page. 17 All this typographical evidence makes it clear that the striking differences between the numbers of contractions and abbreviations set from page to page are not the trademarks of two workmen, nor the result of setting from cast-off copy. 18 These irregularities reflect instead the varying states of the case as the job progressed. Whenever compositor K and apprentice Y set abbreviations and substantial numbers of contractions they did so only because they were short of type. With these conclusions at hand we can explain away the overlappings shown in Table 6 ("Contractions", and "Quads set before punctuation marks") and the differences in the numbers of contractions set in the pages of gathering C, and can at last return to explaining the anomalous width and length of pages E4 to E5v (Table 6). What seems to have happened at this stage of the job, as in the case of gathering C, is that compositor K had to hurry up with the setting of gathering E (probably because the pressmen were idle and he did not have a complete forme ready for them), whereupon he cast off copy for pages E4 to E5v and gave it to his helper as soon as apprentice Y had finished setting type for page E3v. Then compositor K began setting page E6 (see the numbers of quads set before punctuation marks in these pages: E3(19), E3v(12), E4(11), E4v(28), E5(22), E5v(22), all set by apprentice Y; and E6(2), E6v(2), E7(7), E7v(7), E8(4), E8v(7), all set by compositor K). By doing so compositor K saved some precious time because instead of one compositor having to set five pages to complete one forme (apprentice Y would have had to set pages E4, E4v, E5, E5v, and E6 to complete the first forme of the gathering—pages E3v, E4, E5v, and E6) apprentice Y and compositor K had to set only six pages between the two of them (E4 to E6v) to complete two formes (inner and outer formes of the inner sheet; see Table 2), and keep the pressmen busy. If both workmen were setting simultaneously they could not, of course, set from the same case, as indeed they did not. One has only to compare the upper-case C's, G's, and P's used in pages E4 to E5v with those used elsewhere in the book to realize that these four pages were set from a different case (cf., for instance, the upper-case types that appear on pages E3v, lines 26, 28, 31, 32, and 33; E6, lines 2, 3, 4, and 7; and E6v, line 8, with the upper-case types that appear on pages E4, lines 2, 5, 7, 10, and 11; and E5v, lines 24, 28, and 32). When apprentice Y finished setting his stint he found himself about eight lines short of type, and thus began shortening the length of his lines by three millimetres each, but this reduction was not enough and he ended by having to impose these pages one line shorter than the average page. There must have been some rush to give work to the pressmen, because as soon as apprentice Y had finished fixing page E5 either he or, more probably, compositor K broke the normal order for imposing and running off the formes and imposed the outer forme of the inner sheet (E3, E4v, E5, E6v) before the inner forme, which contained the last page of the stint of apprentice Y (E3v, E4, E5v, E6), and gave it to the pressmen to run off. We know that this is what in all probability happened because there is an error in a running title that supports such a theory. Running title h appears complete on page B8v, it appears without the middle " e " of ex[]mplares on pages C3v and E6v, but it appears fixed on page E5v (and elsewhere). It is obvious that the outer forme of the inner sheet must have been printed before the inner forme of the inner sheet. And thus we come to understand the reasons that lie behind all the anomalies (shorter and narrower pages of type, and different typefaces) and seeming irregularities (numbers of quads set before punctuation marks, and numbers of contractions used per page) that we find in gathering E of the first edition of Novelas ejemplares . Some thought, however, should be given here to the identity of the Cuesta man who set pages E4 to E5v. Could he have been a third compositor setting from his own case of type rather than apprentice Y setting from a case usually assigned to another Cuesta man? I think not, for two reasons: two occurrences of one of the preferred spellings of apprentice Y appear precisely on one of these pages (see Table 4, variant 12), and the numbers of quads set before punctuation marks (eleven, twenty-eight, twenty-two, twenty-two) are well within the range of apprentice Y. There are a few other irregular pages in the first edition of Novelas ejemplares (see footnote 6. Also, page S8 has an irregular width of one hundred millimetres), but these anomalies are in all probability the result of minor adjustments or miscounting. The casting off of copy when setting prose works from manuscript copy makes more sense when two or more compositors are setting simultaneously and are using different cases of type (as during the setting of the first editions of Parts I and II of Don Quixote , and gathering E of the first edition of Novelas ejemplares ), but accomplishes relatively little when only one compositor is at work or when the compositors are both setting alternately and using the same cases of type, as compositor K and apprentice Y obviously were throughout most of the job. Therefore, I would conclude that even though these Cuesta men might have at times absorbed a few extra lines of type by using contractions and abbreviations, and might have on occasions expanded their lines of type by setting extra quads, their favourite recourses were either to increase (pages C3 to C6v) or decrease (pages E4 to E5v) the length of their lines of type according to the particular situation in which they found themselves. But these conclusions acquire weight only after one has understood, explained, and demonstrated that there were two compositors at work in the setting of the first edition of Novelas ejemplares , that each compositor had his own characteristic quadmark, and that the variations in the numbers of contractions and abbreviations used per page reflect the state of the case at any given moment. Were we asked to provide further textual evidence to uphold these theories we would not have to go too far afield in our search for this evidence. No two copies of the first edition of Novelas ejemplares are identical, of course, but most typographical differences reflect only the natural wear and tear of type or minor accidents that occurred during the running off of the formes. Some copies of this book, however, differ from one another in other respects. Copy C.59.b.20, The British Library, has four pages (Ee4, Ee4v, Ee5, and Ee5v) which were not printed from the same formes used for printing those of copy G.10181, The British Library. The running titles that appear on pages Ee4 to Ee5v of copy G.10181 belong to the set of running titles used throughout the book (running titles k, n, k, and l; see Table 2), thus we can confidently assert that the four pages of this copy are part of the original full inner sheet of gathering Ee. Moreover, because copies G.10181 and C.59.b.20 differ from one another only on these four pages, because two of the four running titles used in the pages of copy C.59.b.20 belong also to the original set of running titles (running titles m, Ee4; and p, Ee5v), and because some of the types used in the running titles show more wearing on pages Ee4 to Ee5v of copy C.59.b.20 than in the following pages where these running titles appear, we can conclude that both copies belong to the same edition, that pages Ee4 to Ee5v were set twice to make up a short run, and that the pages of copy C.59.b.20 belong to the second printing of the sheet. 19 I will distinguish between these two copies following the same system and nomenclature I used when dealing with copies of the first edition of Don Quixote , Part I (see The Compositors , pp. 33 and ff.). Copy G.10181, The British Library, belongs to family group A of the first edition of Novelas ejemplares; copy C.59.b.20, The British Library, belongs to family group B. Furthermore, because the compositor who re-set pages Ee4 to Ee5v accidentally retained an obviously incorrect reading that occurs in the original pages ( socorrido —in lieu of the correct feminine form socorrida —copy G.10181, Ee5, line 32; copy C.59.b.20, Ee5, line 33) we can ascertain that he used the printed rather than the authorial manuscript pages as his copy. But these assertions are all foregone conclusions. More important would be to answer the questions: why did the compositors have to re-set these four pages? And when and by whom were they re-set? One telling characteristic of pages Ee4, Ee4v, Ee5, and Ee5v is that they occur on perfected sides of the same half of the inner sheet of gathering Ee. Therefore the second printing of these pages cannot be the result of a last-minute shortage of copies of the inner sheet of the gathering, otherwise the compositors would have had to re-set the pages of both formes. What apparently happened is that someone must have spilled something over, or somehow damaged this half section of a considerable number of sheets. 20 Hence the accident must have occurred when the sheets were stacked together waiting to be folded. The facts that some types of the running titles used in the second printing of pages Ee4 to Ee5v show more wear in the re-set pages than in the last gatherings of the book, that the running titles used in pages Ee4 and Ee5 (second printing) came in all probability from the very last page of the book with text (Mm2) and from the last forme of gathering Ll, and, finally, that the compositor had to set two new running titles (probably because most of the original running titles either had already been distributed or were still in press) strongly suggest that the resetting of pages Ee4 to Ee5v probably took place when compositor K was finishing, or had just finished setting the last gathering of the book. The workman who re-set the pages made a considerable number of changes, but the changes introduced are all incidental, cancel each other out, and/or have very few occurrences; hence, they do not help us to pinpoint the identity of the compositor who made them. 21 I have shown elsewhere, however, that the Cuesta compositors changed some spellings of their copy as a matter of course. So, it is most surprising that only four spelling changes were made in these pages, especially because the changes might not be, after all, spelling variants but rather the result of the compositor's wanting to save space ( por que to porque , and si no to sino ; we must keep in mind that the compositor expanded one hundred and ten contractions, and, consequently, had to set his lines of type tighter to allow for these changes) and a foul case ( Yglesia to Iglesia ; there is an occurrence of the form Yglesia just four lines below the "spelling variant", suggesting that the change might not have been intentional). It logically follows from these premises that the compositor of the re-set pages must have been either compositor K or his apprentice, who are unlikely to have introduced spelling variants in the text they had already regularized. Had the compositor set these pages from the same case of type used throughout most of the job we would have been able to reaffirm this contention, but we would have found ourselves on a dead-end road because we would not have been able to ascertain precisely which of the two men set the pages belonging to the second printing. Fortunately, the compositor of the re-set pages did not use this case, he resorted instead to the case used earlier to set pages E4 to E5v of this edition (cf. the upper-case types used in the two sets of pages), which also happens to have been the case from which compositor K took the long upper-case Y's he needed when he was setting page N2v (see above, footnote 15; the only upper-case Y's used in the re-set pages appear on page Ee5, lines 14 and 15). Now then, had compositor K been the person who re-set pages Ee4 to Ee5v he would have almost certainly used his own case of type. Therefore we must conclude that the Cuesta man who re-set these four pages was apprentice Y. Furthermore, because apprentice Y did not use the case of his instructor we can surmise that both men were probably setting simultaneously (as they did when setting gathering E), and that compositor K must have been working on the last pages of the book. Hence, the more likely sequence in which running title m might have been used is: inner forme of the inner sheet of gathering Ll (page Ll6; see Table 2), re-set pages (page Ee4), and page Mm2. What could have happened, and in all likelihood did happen is that when apprentice Y finished re-setting pages Ee4 to Ee5v compositor K was still at work on pages Mm1v and Mm2. So he probably imposed pages Mm1 and Mm2v (colophon only!) together with his pages Ee4 and Ee5v (twin-half page imposition), and thus the pressmen had a forme to run right away. Then apprentice Y set two new running titles and had pages Ee4v and Ee5 ready and waiting to be imposed with the last pages of the book. Once both sides of the sheets had been printed and the ink dried, the workmen folded the sheets and cut them in half. The pressmen did not have to run as many copies of the re-set pages as of pages Mm1 and Mm2v because they needed only enough copies of pages Ee4 and Ee5v to make up for the number of sheets which had been damaged. Consequently, they must have taken the re-set pages out sometime during the run of this forme. And thus the type of pages Ee4 and Ee5v could have been distributed before compositor K had imposed the last forme of gathering Mm. This sequence of events would explain how running title m could have been used in both formes (pages Ee4 and Mm2). The whole process could have been slightly different, but this hypothetical reconstruction of what might have happened seems to me the most plausible and practical way of dealing with this problem. From the changes that apprentice Y made to his copy we now can double check and polish some of the conclusions reached earlier. Because he expanded one hundred and ten contractions and developed two abbreviations in spite of the fact that he had to fit (and did fit) his text into exactly four average pages proves that he did not like to contract or abbreviate and, thus, that the numerous contractions and abbreviations he set in the first edition of Novelas ejemplares are not the result of a compositorial habit nor of his need to absorb extra text. This dislike for setting abbreviations and contractions is especially evident because of all the hundreds of changes he made, only five are contractions, and because compositor Y set these five contractions on the very last lines of the last page of the stint (Ee5v, second printing, lines 22, 25, and 33: fatisfacion&gt;fatiſfaciõ, que&gt;qtilde, acompañaſſedes &gt;acõpañaſſedes, cuenta&gt;cuetildeta, and que&gt;qtilde). it is obvious that he set these abbreviations only when he found himself forced to fit the remaining thirteen and one half lines of his copy text in the thirteen lines he had left if he was to end with a regular thirty-four line page. This fact proves that apprentice Y used contractions (and probably also abbreviations) as one of the several means he had at his disposal for absorbing extra text, but that he did it occasionally, and only as a last resource when the text that needed to be absorbed was not considerably long. To compensate for the numerous expansions he made, apprentice Y had to set his lines of type tighter than was his normal practice, but he nevertheless set a substantial number of quads before punctuation marks (thirty-nine; an average of ten quads per page), showing once again that this habit was one of his stronger compositorial trademarks. It is evident, too, that his spelling preferences agreed almost one hundred per cent with those of compositor K's. In other words, the changes introduced in the re-set pages and the lack of orthographic variants between the original and the re-set pages corroborate and reinforce several of the theories stated earlier. Fascinating as the study of these typographical and textual characteristics of the finished book might be, the most crucial questions still remain to be answered. Did compositor K and apprentice Y respect the orthography of their copy? Does the remarkable spelling consistency we find in the first edition of Novelas ejemplares indicate that these Cuesta men retained most of the authorial spellings? Or, on the contrary, should it be taken as a crystal clear sign that they imposed their own preferred spellings relentlessly over and above those of the original manuscript? The striking consistency of the compositors in their use of the form vuessa merced and its abbreviations (v.m., vs.ms.) suggests that they followed the authorial spellings conscientiously. But knowing, as we now know, that Cervantes spelled the past indicative and the future and past subjunctive of the auxiliary verb haber without initial "h" ( vuo , vuiere , vuiera , vuiesse ; see The Compositors , especially pp. 88-89), and that he used both forms of the word misma ( misma and mesma ), it comes as a surprise to find out that both compositor K and apprentice Y set all occurrences of these forms of the auxiliary verb with initial "h" ( huuo , huuiere , huuiera , huuiesse ), and that no occurrences of the form mesma could be found in Novelas ejemplares . It follows, then, that compositor K and apprentice Y used only the form vuessa merced (vis-à-vis vuestra merced ) solely because their preferred spelling agreed in this instance with that of Cervantes's, not because they accepted or were following the original orthography of the manuscript. When their preferred spellings did not agree with those of Cervantes's, these Cuesta men did not hesitate in the least to impose their own preferred spellings or to regularize what had intentionally been spelled differently for purposes stylistic or for characterization (see above, estoria / historia , footnote 7). The word Constantinopla , amongst dozens of other words I could bring forth, furnishes an excellent example of these workmen's tampering with the original orthography. In the first edition of Don Quixote , Part I, we find this word spelled either Costantinopla (pages Ff8v, Hh4v, Kk3, and Kk3v) or Constantinopla (pages Gg1, Gg2v, Gg3[2], Gg4, and Gg4v[2]). Compositors D and E set the form Costantinopla . Compositor F used the other form. But when compositor E set all these occurrences in the second Madrid edition of Don Quixote , Part I, he set them exactly as they appear in the first edition, an example of which he used as his copy, i.e., he set four occurrences of the form Costantinopla and seven occurrences of the form Constantinopla . Hence we can conclude 1) that compositor E was a reliable workman because, even though he might have preferred one spelling to the other, he nevertheless followed the orthography of his copy with some care, and thus, 2) that Cervantes's spelling (and pronunciation!) was Costantinopla . And yet, of the thirteen occurrences of this word set in the first edition of Novelas ejemplares (pages G1, G1v, G3, G4[2], G5v, G6, H2v[2], H3[3], and H6) I found no occurrences of the authorial form. This fact clearly shows that compositor K and apprentice Y had little respect for the original orthography of their copy. Summing up: the setting and printing of the first edition of Novelas ejemplares was a relatively uneventful job which progressed steadily though at an accelerated pace with the pressmen running off the formes as soon as they left the hands of the compositors. 22 Of the five hundred and seventy pages with text (¶lv blank; Mm2v, colophon) only pages C3, C3v, C4, C4v, C5, C5v, C6, C6v, E4, E4v, E5, and E5v were set from cast-off copy. Four other pages (Ee4, Ee4v, Ee5, and Ee5v) had to be set and run off twice due to some accident that damaged one half of the inner sheet of gathering Ee of a considerable number of sheets. Therefore the copies of this edition should be separated into two family groups: those copies having the pages of the first printing (like copy G.10181, The British Library) belong to family group A, and those having the re-set pages (like copy C.59.b.20, The British Library, and the copy of The Hispanic Society of America) belong to family group B. The setting of the entire work was assigned to one workman, compositor K, but the text in fact was set by two Cuesta men, compositor K and his apprentice. The orthography and setting habits of these two men were very similar, a circumstance that was to be expected. Apprentice Y was learning the trade under the direction of compositor K and, naturally, had to accept and follow closely the grammatical rules laid down by, and the spelling preferences of, his instructor, and in the process acquire similar setting habits. But a dozen key words and the distinctive quadmarks of these Cuesta men served as the basis for separating and identifying them, and also for giving us an approximate idea of the pages, or sections of pages each workman set. More important, however, is the fact that these Cuesta men changed many of the authorial spellings relentlessly. After studying the spellings used in the first edition of Novelas ejemplares and comparing them with the spellings used in the first editions of Galatea , Don Quixote , Persiles y Sigismunda , Ocho comedias , and Viaje del Parnaso , we can conclude, albeit tentatively, that the text we have in the first edition of Novelas ejemplares is probably the most corrupt text we have of any of Cervantes's works. And thus, what initially might have been seen as merely an academic exercise acquires a new and more urgent character because we now realize that the attitude that compositor K and apprentice Y had towards the orthography of their copy reached at the very roots of Cervantes's style and lexicon. As long as we did not know that the apparently chaotic orthography we have in the first editions of Cervantes's works was the result of the compositors imposing their individual spelling and punctuation preferences over and above those of Cervantes's, eclectic editing and regularization were in some degree justified. Now, however, we know not only that the first editions reflect the original orthography only vaguely, but also that it is possible to recover many of the authorial spellings and linguistic nuances of Cervantes's style. Editors of Cervantes's works have in front of them an unexplored and unexploited gold mine. My own research on the writing and on the setting and printing of the first editions of Don Quixote and Novelas ejemplares , and the conclusions reached therein, should not be accepted without first putting them through a systematic, rigorous, and thorough testing. Editors and critics should query and double check every one of my findings and theories to ascertain the reliability of my conclusions, to correct my mistakes, and to propose different or more refined solutions than I have. Only through this humanistic process of constant questioning, testing, revising, and improving can we hope to produce reliable editions of our texts. I personally think that a definitive edition is an impossible dream, a contradiction of terms, but editors should rise to the challenge and quixotically attempt to achieve the unattainable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Each of these four works presents editors with completely different job patterns, and this distribution of labour amongst the various compositors produced texts which retain little of Cervantes's orthography, reflecting instead a complex web made up with the differing spelling and punctuation preferences and setting habits of the compositors who set them. See my monographs The Compositors of the First and Second Madrid Editions of "Don Quixote", Part I , The Modern Humanities Research Association, London, 1975, "El caso del epígrafe desaparecido: Capítulo 43 de la edición príncipe del Quijote ", Nueva Revista de Filología Hispánica , 28 (1980), 352-360, "The Compositors of the First Edition of Don Quixote , Part II", Journal of Hispanic Philology , 6 (1981), 3-44, and "The Need for a Scholarly, Modernized Edition of Cervantes' Works", Cervantes , 2 (1982), 69-87. I am now at work on three articles dealing with the setting and printing of the first editions of Galatea (Juan Gracián, Alcala, 1585), Viaje del Parnaso (widow of Alonso Martín, Madrid, 1614), and Persiles y Sigismunda . I wish to thank Professors J. B. Avalle-Arce and L. A. Murillo for their friendship and for the continuous support they have given me for the past several years. 2 My reference copy is copy G. 10181, The British Library. Formula: 4° in eights, ¶ 4 ¶¶ 8 A-Ll 8 Mm 2 , fols. 1-12 , 1-274 (57 2 pp.) 3 When the compositors of Don Quixote found the form vuesa merced in their copy texts they set it either as vuessa merced (two hundred and eighteen occurrences) or vuestra merced (five hundred and fifty-three occurrences), or used an abbreviation (three hundred and seventy-six occurrences), each compositor having his own preferred form (these numbers of occurrences include plural forms and a few occurrences of related forms of the word vuestra which are not an element of the form of address vuestra merced ); see my article "The Need for a Scholarly, Modernized Edition", pp. 72-77. 4 It is no coincidence, of course, that one third (forty-three) of the total number of occurrences of the form of address vuesa merced appear in the short story Rinconete y Cortadillo , where the principal characters are two pícaro-like urchins, who are surrounded by tramps, beggars, corrupt bumbailiffs, prostitutes, pimps, bullies, and murderers, none of whom should have been addressed as vuesa merced . Cervantes's humorous darts aimed at his countrymen's all-too-frequent abuse and misuse of this formal form of address are glaringly evident in this short-story. 5 The Cuesta compositors set mainly spaces before punctuation marks, but some of them set also quads. Here I use the term "space" to refer to the blank spaces left on the printed page, and the term "quad" to designate the pieces of type, regardless of width. When one plots the data entered in Table 3 according to the numbers of pages having the same number of quads set before punctuation marks per page, the resulting mean line is what I call a compositorial quadmark; see Diagram 1. In my article "The Compositors of the First Edition of Don Quixote , Part II" I showed that each one of the compositors who set copy for the first editions of Parts I and II of Don Quixote had his own characteristic quadmark, and I was able to corroborate the boundaries of their stints with the help of this device. 6 Most pages of the first edition of Novelas ejemplares have thirty-four lines of text, but some pages are irregular in this respect and have either thirty-one (A2v), thirty-two (P6), thirty-three (¶¶1, A5, A5v, E4-E5v, G1, G2, G2v, G5-G6, K3, K3v, L2, O5, O5v, P2, S1, S1v, V5, V5v), or thirty-five lines (C4). Thus, some pages have more or fewer quads set before punctuation marks than others simply because they have more or fewer lines of text than the average page. These possible differences in the numbers of quads set before punctuation marks cannot be estimated, but, in order to avoid further discrepancies, in Diagram 1, I considered only full pages of type irrespective of the total number of lines per page, and pages with paragraph divisions which amount to less than two full lines of blank spaces per page. The pages excluded are: ¶1-¶4v, ¶¶1v, ¶¶2, ¶¶3, ¶¶3v, ¶¶5-¶¶8v, A1, A2, A2v, A3v-A5v, A6v-A7v, A8v-B1v, C1-C2, D5v-D6v, E6, G5, I1v, I2, L2, L2v, L4, L4v, L6v, L7, O7, P6v, Q5v, Q6, S1v, T7v-T8v, V6, V6v, X5, Y3v-Y6v, Y8, Y8v, Aa5v, Dd3v, Dd4, Ff8v, Gg1, Gg6v, Gg8v, Kk5v, Mm2, and Mm2v. 7 For example, in Rinconete y Cortadillo the uneducated pimp Repolido says: "no fe toquen estorias paffadas" (L2v, lines 3 and 4; my italics here and below), appositely using the 'incorrect" form estoria , but his mistress the prostitute Juliana la Cariharta, incongruently uses the "correct", and phonetically different form historia , "de la qual verdadera historia fon buenos teftigos eftos cardenales" (K7, lines 21 to 23). Cervantes, with his finely tuned ear to this sort of linguistic nuance, in all probability used the form estoria in both excerpts, because at no other time in the story does he make any differentiation between the vocabulary of Repolido and that of his mistress, as he pointedly and repeatedly does when he wants to emphasise the differences between the vocabulary of Rinconete, who was able to read, and those of most of the other characters of the story, who were illiterate. 8 What firm conclusions could we draw, for instance, from the spelling variant camuça/camuza when we have only one occurrence of each form (pages I2v, line 2, and Ii6, line 5, respectively), except that the word gamuza (soft leather made from the skin of chamois, sheep, deer, etc.) could be spelled in at least two different ways? 9 One example of this tendency to switch spellings in midstream is the clear-cut change that compositor E made in the first edition of Don Quixote , Part I from the form sospirar to suspirar ( sospirar , gatherings I [one occurrence], M[1], N[1], and Q[1]; suspirar , gatherings R[2], V[7], Bb[1], Kk[1], and Nn[1]). In this instance the dominant compositorial spelling is suspirar , not only because there are more occurrences of this form (12) than of the form sospirar (4), but also because the compositorial spelling appears in the last gatherings set by compositor E, when he was already used to Cervantes's handwriting and it was easier for him to impose his own spellings over and above those of his printer's copy. 10 The spelling Precetor is in fact a double variant (capitalization and spelling, Precetor/preceptor ) which could not have been incurred accidentally; hence I have included it in Table 4 even though it shows only one occurrence. 11 The quadmarks of some compositors change according to whether the compositors were setting seriatim or from cast-off copy (see "The Compositors", Diagrams 5 to 8). 12 8(pages) x 34(lines per page) + 1(extra line in page C4) = 273(lines). 273(lines) x 4(millimetres added to each line) = 1092(millimetres added). 1092(millimetres) ÷ 98 (length in millimetres of an average full line of type) = 11(average lines). 11(average lines) + 1(extra line in page C4) = 12(extra lines of type absorbed). 13 I am considering here and throughout the remaining pages of this study only the following contractions: ã for "am" or "an", etilde for "em" or "en", õ for "om" or "on", ũ for "um" or "un", ð for "de", and qtilde for "que". 14 The main typeface used was St Augustin Roman of Garamond, 95 x 1.9:2.9. Occasionally it is difficult to tell exactly which sort or sorts were scarce at a given time, especially because the same contractions might reflect different shortages at different times (an "ã" could be used to make up for shortages of a's, m's, or n's), but compositor K and apprentice Y usually made up for shortages of a's by setting the preposition a with accentuated types (á, à, or â). Hence, we can often point out the nature of the shortages without entering into exhaustive studies of the types. For example: page N4 has only four contractions and two accentuated prepositions (out of a total of eleven occurrences of the preposition a ); pages N4v and N5 have, in contrast, one hundred and thirty-three contractions and thirty-one accentuated prepositions (out of a total of thirty-seven occurrences of the preposition a ); and page N5v has only two contractions but ten accentuated prepositions (out of a total of fourteen occurrences of the preposition a ). It is crystal clear that the compositor had sufficient types of all sorts when he set page N4, that he was short of all the most frequently used sorts when he set pages N4v and N5, and that he was short only of a's when he set page N5v. 15 One shortage of type could not be solved by using contractions. When compositor K began setting page N2v he ran out of upper-case Y's because he had set a considerable number of occurrences of the word Yſabela in the previous pages. To make up for this shortage compositor K borrowed about twenty upper-case Y's from another case (the extraneous Y's have a longer body than the Y's of the main fount used). Compositor K used ten of the borrowed Y's in page N2v, but just as he was finishing this page his case was replenished with type (the last seven lines of page N2v have no contractions and the last upper-case Y used in this page [line 34] is not one of the borrowed types). (The clean type came from the inner forme of the outer sheet of gathering M—M1v, M2, M7v, and M8—the broken E that appears on pages M8, line 14, and N4v, line 32, is the same type). When the clean type was emptied into the case the compositor's own Y's fell on top of the borrowed types he had not yet used. Apprentice Y (page N3, thirty nine quads set before punctuation marks) and compositor K set their own Y's in pages N3 to N6, but as page N6v was being finished they began using the borrowed Y's that had been left at the bottom of the box, mixing them with the original Y's (one long Y appears on page N6v, line 33; three on page N7v, lines 25, 29, and 34; five on page N8, lines 8, 21, 26, 32, and 34; etc. None of the long Y's used in pages N6v, N7v, and N8 could be any of the types used in page N2v because this page belongs to the last forme of gathering N—N1, N2v, N7, and N8v). The fact that compositor K ended with a mixed box of upper-case Y's is evident throughout the remaining gatherings of the book (including gatherings ¶ and ¶¶) where examples of both sorts of Y's appear side by side. 16 I refer only to compositor K here and below to simplify my explanation, but it should be kept in mind that he and apprentice Y were working together throughout the setting of this work. 17 In the following list the numbers of abbreviations of vuesa merced and other related forms and of contractions appear within parentheses: B7v(1, 10), D2(2, 61), E1(1, 33), E2(1, 38), H5(1, 58), I2v(3, 61), I3(10, 39), I3v(4, 14), I4(1, 4), I4v(1, 12), I5v(1, 8), I6(1, 6), I6v(1,6), I7(1, 5), I8v(1, 6), K2v(2, 14), L3(1, 21), L5(1, 6), M2v(1, 38), M3(7, 57), M3v(3, 6), N1(1, 42), N2(1, 19), N5(1, 95), R5(1, 7), V2(1, 10; the abbreviation and the contractions appear on the first eleven lines of the page, and it is worth noting also that page V1 has twenty-four contractions and page V1v has eighteen contractions), V3(1, 45), X1v(1, 32), Z1(1, 42), Z5(4, 62), Aa2(1, 41), Aa2v(4, 16), Bb3(2, 50), Cc1v(2, 50), Dd1(3, 50), Dd2v(3, 93), Ee5(2, 41), Ff1v(2, 72), Ff2(4, 57), Gg1v(4, 71), Gg2(1, 48), Gg2v(1, 36), Mm1(1, 16), and Mm2(1, 15). The abbreviations for the word nuestra (nrtildea.) and related forms show a similar distribution. Out of twenty-seven abbreviations only one appears on a page which has fewer than fifteen contractions (title-page). These facts are watertight proofs that at times the compositors were indeed short of some sorts of type, and that they used abbreviations and contractions to offset these temporary shortages. 18 This theory explains why some pages set seriatim have nearly as many contractions as do other pages set from cast-off copy (cf., for instance, pages C2v and C7 [seriatim] with pages C3 and C5v [from cast-off copy]; see Table 7). Also, if the variations on the numbers of contractions or abbreviations were the result of the compositors' not being able to fit their copy into their stints the increases in the numbers of contractions and abbreviations would under normal circumstances appear at the end rather than at the beginning or in the middle of gatherings (see, however, pp. 14 to 16 of The Compositors ). An average page of the first edition of Novelas ejemplares has between zero and twelve contractions. Page ¶3 is the only page of gatherings ¶ and ¶¶ that has an irregular number of contractions (twenty-one), but this anomaly did not arise from any shortage of type (the compositors used four different typefaces in these gatherings: St Augustin Roman, St Augustin Italic, Parangon Roman, and Parangon Italic), but rather from the compositor's trying to fit three short official licences in one page. He was not able to do so, however, and ended by imposing the last four lines (less than three full lines of type) of the third licence in the next page (¶3v). 19 Running title m appears in similar conditions of wear on pages Ee4 (second printing) and Mm2. Running title p shows more damage on page Ee5v (second printing) than on page Ll2v; cf. especially the " p " and last " e " of exemplares . The swash uppercase " N " used in the running title of page Ee4v (second printing) is the same type used in running title n, but the running titles are not the same (cf. the types of the word exemplares ). The " N " appears more damaged on page Ee4v (second printing) than on page Ll5v. The running title used on page Ee5 (second printing) is none of the original running titles. 20 The main reason why I consider that the number of sheets damaged must have been considerable is the fact that of the three copies I have examined, out of the few extant copies we have, two of them have the pages of the second printing (copy C.59.b.20, The British Library, and the copy of The Hispanic Society of America). 21 The changes are: one hundred and ten expansions of contractions, forty-two substitutions of one sort of accentuated type for another, eighty-three variations on line endings, thirty-six deletions or insertions of accents (five added, ten taken out), quads before punctuation marks (five added, nine taken out), and hyphens at the end of lines (five added, two taken out), four substitutions of "ſs" by "ſſ" (always -ſsetilde to -ſſen), two developments of abbreviations, three changes in punctuation marks (nõbre.&gt;nõbre:—Ee5, 25 and Ee5, 26—quiſiere,&gt;quiſiere—Ee5v, 19—and gente&gt;gente,—Ee5v, 23), five corrections of textual errors (conocido,&gt;conocido., Ee4, 24; Hiziet[on]lo&gt;Hizier[on]lo, Ee4v, 17; Lorençò&gt;Lorenço, Ee4v, 24; hermano&gt;hermana, Ee5v, 2; and apatentes&gt;aparentes, Ee5v, 10), introduction of two textual errors (pero qtilde no&gt;pero no, Ee4v, 21; and lo qtilde quiere&gt;lo quiere, Ee4v, 33), four spelling variants (por que&gt;porque, Ee4, 19; ſi no&gt;ſino, Ee4v, 1 and Ee5, 15; and Ygleſia&gt;Igleſia, Ee5, 10), and five contractions. 22 The gatherings of the alphabetical sequence were set and printed between 14 July 1613 (date of the dedication) and 7 August 1613 (date of the errata). The book was probably on the market by mid August. Cervantes applied for the official licences for Aragon before the work was sent to press (the imprimatur states: " se deue imprimir "; and the copyright reads: " le desseays imprimir "), but the licences were granted when the book was about to be finished (imprimatur, 31 July 1613; copyright, 9 August 1613).</field>
