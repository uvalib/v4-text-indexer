      <field name="heading_text">The Relationship of English Printed Books to Authors' Manuscripts during the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries The 1928 Sandars Lectures by R. B. McKERROW edited by Carlo M. Bajetta *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Editor's Introduction 1. The 1928 Sandars Lectures: Their Occasion and Significance Having been called to review the contribution to English studies of his late friend and fellow bibliographer Ronald Brunless McKerrow, Sir Walter Wilson Greg observed that “the whole significance of his teaching” lay in “the importance he attached to the derivations of the text.” 1 McKerrow's celebrated Introduction to Bibliography (first published in 1927) 2 considers the investigation of the mechanics of printing chiefly as a means to illuminate the question of how nearly a printed book may represent the author's original manuscript. The opening of the third part of the Introduction clearly states the raison d'être of the volume: All that has been written hitherto in this book has been, or should have been, directed, immediately or remotely, to the elucidation of the single problem of the relation between the text of a printed book and the original MS. of its author. 3 It is interesting to note, however, that the discussion of this topic occupies only a slender section of the book, covering a total of twenty-five pages. But the reason McKerrow dealt with the subject at all is essentially that his mind was never content to rest on what was already a great achievement. He was able to use the occasion of the 1928 reprint of his Introduction to make “a few corrections and small additions” (p. viii), while his election as the prestigious Sandars Reader in Bibliography in 1928 allowed him to explore at length the textual questions he had sketched out in the book. 4 In the course of three memorable lectures, he presented to his audience, as he stated with characteristic modesty, “a little more methodical survey of the whole subject than, so far as I know, exists at present, and one which may perhaps make the problem of emendation, in certain respects, a little clearer.” 5 What McKerrow did not emphasise on this occasion was that, after he had laid down the principles in the Introduction, he was starting to move on, and to show the practical applications of his teaching. In so doing, he would, in fact, overthrow much current dogma on the editing of Elizabethan dramatic texts. 6 He had to advance his argument by degrees, with clear, wellstated evidence at each step. The lectures could not see the press as they had been delivered. Even if apparently neutral, much of their content (his rehabilitation of Elizabethan printers in particular) was a direct attack on contemporary textual criticism, and McKerrow's exposition had to be as judicious and precise as possible. When, in 1930, he sent a copy of his talks to the Cambridge University Library, in compliance with the readership terms, he enclosed a note to Alwyn Faber Scholfield, then librarian to the University, that spoke of his delay:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Mr. Scholfield, It occurs to me every now and then that never having sent you my Sandars Lectures for 1928 I have never received the fee for them. As I think I told you the Syndics of the Press kindly offered to print them, but I was not altogether satisfied with them as delivered and wanted to do some more work on certain points. This, however, has never been got done, so I had better send them to you [...] as they are. A copy has been deposited at the British Library and I enclose the official receipt which you will presumably need to have as evidence that the requirements of the Readership have been complied with. 7 Yours sincerely R. B. McKerrow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">7 The letter, undated, is now enclosed with one of the carbon copies of the typescript, Cambridge University Library 860.b.87 (see below). The British Library copy, to which McKerrow refers as having been handed in already, was presented by the author on 1 January 1930, as witnessed by a librarian's note on the first flyleaf. The Cambridge University Library copy was bound (according to the top of the first flyleaf) by “John P. Gray and Son” of Cambridge in 1930.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Certainly at least some work had already been done before these sheets were sent, as witnessed by the corrections and afterthoughts inserted in this and in the other two copies of the typescript. More work was to be done later: as Greg observed, the papers which derived from these lectures constitute his friend's “most important contribution to what I should have annoyed him by calling the bibliographical criticism of dramatic texts.” 8 During his talks at Cambridge McKerrow had touched points that he clearly considered of great importance. One in particular was a topic on which he had dared to disagree—and disagree in public—with some close friends and important scholars such as Alfred W. Pollard and John Dover Wilson, namely type-setting from prompt-book. This was much more than a merely theoretical discussion, since it involved a new way of looking at the printing of Shakespeare's plays and, most importantly, a new way of editing them. McKerrow was later to make his disagreement public again. In 1931 he read a paper on “The Elizabethan Printer and Dramatic Manuscripts” before the Bibliographical Society. 9 While using some material from the Cambridge lectures, on this occasion McKerrow avoided the more general parts and focused on dramatic manuscripts, and in particular on “foul papers” and “prompt-book.” Another paper, “The Treatment of Shakespeare's Text by his Earlier Editors, 1709- 1768,” read as the Annual Shakespeare Lecture before the British Academy in 1933, 10 went back to an important point touched at the beginning of the first Cambridge lecture. This was the debt, for good or bad, that twentieth-century textual editors owed to earlier editors from Rowe to Capell, a theme also dealt with briefly in the Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare of 1939. 11 One may or may not want to read between the lines and look for the polemical accent in these papers. At any rate, it was with the Cambridge talks that McKerrow started to react openly against some of the most influential trends in editorial theory and practice. Greg, whose Calculus of Variants had appeared in 1927, was privy to his friend's ideas and shared his projects, including his emphasis on bibliographical investigation. One may detect in these lectures some movement from essentially a “best-text” approach that McKerrow had employed twenty-four years earlier in his edition of The Works of Thomas Nashe (where he had coined the term “copy-text”) and that was to receive classic exposition the same year as his talks when the romance philologist Joseph Bédier published his notes on editing the Lai de l'ombre and thereby posed perhaps the most durable challenge to Lachmannian principles. 12 Occasionally McKerrow can now be seen as pointing to the position he would take eleven years later in his Prolegomena, where he foreshadows Greg's point about authority being divided between an early and a later edition. 13 Greg concluded his obituary of McKerrow with the observation that “had he ventured more he would have been greater still.” 14 While McKerrow's cautious attitude may ultimately have restrained his role in the development of twentieth-century editorial theory, his distrust of excess not only was salutary but also was accompanied by radical innovation. His Sandars lectures testify vividly to the temper of his work. Even if outdated on certain specific points, McKerrow's teaching, especially on Elizabethan printing, is in many respects still valuable, and certainly fascinating. Later accounts such as Percy Simpson's Proof-Reading in the Sixteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries (1935) or Charlton Hinman's famous study The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963) have contributed to casting a new light on the practice of Elizabethan and post-Elizabethan typographers, and Philip Gaskell's A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972; repr. with corrections, 1974) has taken the place of McKerrow's book as a classic account of printing methods. More recent publications, including Peter Blayney's The Texts of “King Lear” and their Origins (1982), J. K. Moore's Primary Materials Relating to Copy and Print in English Books of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (1992), and H. R. Woudhuysen's Sir Philip Sidney and the Circulation of Manuscripts 1558-1640 (1996) may help to answer questions that McKerrow's lectures left unresolved. 15 But for a present-day audience these lectures are still a joy to read. While preserving the freshness of a talk, they are of historical importance in providing a concise survey and a vivid picture of bib- liographical studies in the late 1920s. These thoughts of a great scholar also offer an inspiring vision of what bibliographical analysis might achieve. 2. A Note on the Present Edition In 1930 McKerrow deposited carbon copies of the typescript of his talks in the British Library (MS Add. 41998; henceforth L ) and Cambridge University Library (860.b.87; C ). 16 The original typewritten pages came to Trinity College Library, Cambridge (MS Add. b. 111; CT ) probably at a later time. 17 All copies consist of three groups of leaves, 103 folios in total, 260 x 210 mm. Each set has a general title-page as well as three section titles (each containing the general title and the appropriate lecture number). The text pages are numbered 1-37, 1-28 (with 5a following fol. 5), and 1-33, and the paper is watermarked “Rymans Linen Bank.” The typescripts are double-spaced, and single catchwords (followed by a virgule) occur at the bottom of each page. McKerrow did not type these pages himself. Mistakes like “ Fucioss ” for “ Furioso ” (II, par. 17) and “ Euphnes ” for “ Euphues ” (II, par. 15), as well as blank spaces left in the typescript and later filled in by hand (e.g. with “poetaster” on II, par. 29, or “worst” on III, par. 27), suggest that the typist sometimes had difficulty with his handwriting. McKerrow corrected all three typescripts, quite probably on more than one occasion, overlooking a few misprints in one or the other and sometimes inserting minor revisions, especially in CT. 18 CT also preserves marks that seem to indicate it was the copy McKerrow had in front of him when he read the paper—stresses on words he did not feel confident that he would pronounce correctly (e.g. “compénsatory” on I, par. 15), indications regarding the duration of the lecture (such as “¼” or “½,” visible at various points in this copy), and underlinings (as of the word “can” on II, par. 16) to stress emphasis when speaking. The carbon copies ( C, L ) do not preserve any such marks. In editing these lectures, my goal has been to present the text as revised slightly by McKerrow on the surviving typescripts. Even if some of the alterations were made, as is likely, after the delivery of his talks, the lectures with those modifications incorporated still reflect his thinking in 1928, with a little stylistic polishing, and in any event do not affect the substance of what he had to say. The current text generally adheres to that presented by the CT typescript and its manuscript markings, with some small changes incorporated from the other typescripts and with some minor editorial emendations. 19 Such editorial adjustments are few, but they occur as early as the title. On the general title-page of all three copies, the name of the lecture series appears—without correction—as “The Relationship of English Printed Books to Authors' Manuscripts in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries” (my italics). Because “during” is the reading on the three section titles, and “The Relationship of English Printed Books to Authors' Manuscripts during the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries” is the expression used at the beginning of the talk when referring to its title, one may assume that this is certainly what McKerrow intended. Although most of the changes by McKerrow and by the current editor are recorded in the notes, certain alterations have been made silently. Among these are the correction of misprints, the insertion of punctuation necessary to the sense (especially dashes or commas needed to end parenthetical statements), and the addition of italics. The typescript is inconsistent in whether it places single letters and diphthongs in quotation marks when they are referred to separately (the variability may have to do with the weariness of the author or typist in recording all of them in sections dealing with spelling). For clarity these too have now been provided, without further note. Other irregularities, however, have been allowed to stand. No further effort has been made to regularize the typescript's alternating use of single and double quotation marks, its idiosyncratic punctuation—especially the varying position of punctuation with respect to quotation marks—or abbreviations such as “M.S.” and “MS.” that are used indifferently throughout. McKerrow's own notes are printed here at the foot of the page, while variant readings and editorial observations on specific issues have been included respectively in the “Textual Notes” and in the “Editorial Commentary” at the end of the text. The articles McKerrow derived from the lectures have been compared against the talks themselves; given the purpose of the present edition, only some of their passages (those most clearly taken from the text of the lectures) have been quoted in the Editorial Commentary, where significant differences have been discussed.

      <field name="fulltext">I The subject which has been announced for the three lectures which I shall have the honour to deliver before you is “The relationship of English printed books to Authors' manuscripts during the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries,” and, frankly, the title is not a good one, but in spite of all my efforts I have failed to find a better. It is too ponderous, it suggests a weight of dullness which I trust is not inherent in the subject itself, though, indeed, I cannot claim that it is of the lightest; and it does not really explain what the point of the lectures is meant to be. It is therefore necessary that I should begin by giving you some idea of what I propose to talk about, and, if possible, convincing you that the subject is worth your attention. It is perhaps one which most directly concerns those who undertake to edit for modern readers the work of our earlier writers, but its importance is in reality hardly less for those who have to use the result of their labours; for without an understanding of what a modern edition attempts to be, and can be, it is hardly possible to use it aright. I need not remind you that in the historical study of our literature, just as in any other historical study, the attitude of students has changed very greatly during the past century. We are not now content to see the material relics of earlier times restored and repaired in accordance with the fashion of our own day, and we are not content to read the works of our earlier writers re-arranged, respelt, repunctuated and generally tidied up. We may for our own pleasure read Shakespeare in modern spelling and set out with all the apparatus of scene- division and stage-directions which the editors of the eighteenth century thought necessary to accommodate him to the taste of their own days, but no sooner do we begin to study his work, or that of his contemporaries, historically, than we feel the need to get back to that work in the form in which it actually came from the pen of its authors. From the modern-spelling, rearranged text, we have gone back to the old-spelling text, and from that to the so-called facsimile reprint, and from that again to the photographic facsimile, in our attempt to put ourselves in the position of contemporaries of the authors and to see, and, so far as we can, understand their work as they saw and understood it. And, so far as what I may call the external view of literature is concerned, this suffices. It is becoming possible even for those who have not access to great libraries to read the work of many sixteenth and seventeenth century writers in what is practically the form in which it was read by their contemporaries. But we may want to do more than this. We may want to study the works of these writers in relation to the authors themselves. We recognise that in many respects the printed texts do not reproduce what the authors actually wrote; in some cases because they have been intentionally altered by revisers or editors, in all cases to some extent because errors have been introduced since the manuscripts left their authors' hands. When we are dealing with the works of earlier periods—before the introduction of printing—we have always to recognize the possibility of their having been transcribed by persons who spoke a different dialect from that of their authors or whose language belonged to a later period, and who consciously or unconsciously transformed or modified them in the process of transcription. A text that has been printed is—apart from actual errors—subject to very much the same kind of alteration, though for a variety of reasons it may be much more difficult to ascertain to what extent it has been altered and in what direction the alteration has taken place. It is this question which I wish to discuss, for these lectures will be mainly an attempt to discuss the problems involved, to suggest what has been done and what remains to do, rather than to solve them—the question how closely we are entitled to assume that the printed texts of the later part of the sixteenth and earlier part of the seventeenth centuries, of that hundred years which including as it does the life-time of Shakespeare may vaguely be called the Shakespearian period, correspond to what the authors wrote. Much work has of course been directed in recent years to problems of this kind, especially as regards the text of Shakespeare. In particular, much has been done in the admirable edition of his plays now in course of publication at the press of this University; but the problems dealt with have been mainly of the larger sort, questions of revision either by Shakespeare himself or by others, particularly stage-managers and the like and the early editors or printers, including such matters as the responsibility of Shakespeare for division of his plays into scenes or acts; while what I more especially wish to bring to your notice is the minuter, but in a way more fundamental, question of the text itself, not especially of Shakespeare, but in the printed books of his time in general. How close a reproduction of what the author actually wrote in his original manuscript should we expect the printed books of the time to give us? What, according to the current practice of the day, did the printers attempt to do, and what did they succeed in doing? Now it is quite obvious that such questions would not admit of easy or simple answers even if we were to ask them in respect of work of our own day. The same issue of a newspaper may contain a statement of policy by an important political leader and an account of a serious fire contributed by some occasional correspondent who happened to witness it. It is quite likely that the politician's speech as printed will be a very accurate reproduction of the copy supplied, even to the minutest details of punctuation, whereas the account of the fire may have been so rewritten and improved in the newspaper office that the original writer would be hard put to it to recognize it as his own composition at all. Or again, an eminent member of the University, known to have strong views as to punctuation and matters of style in printing, may have a work printed at the University Press. It is not to be doubted that the result will be in a hundred matters of detail—even apart from the mere correctness of the pording—far closer to the author's manuscript than would, say, a pamphlet by an author of no particular importance printed by the average printer of a country town. To-day, however, the divergence between M.S. and printed text—apart from anything due to intentional revision by an editor or proof-reader—is limited as a rule to punctuation and certain details of spelling in words which may be spelt in more than one way—such as `advertize,' spelt either with -se or -ze, in which the compositor will ordinarily follow the custom of his particular printing-house—and consequently are seldom of importance except when, as sometimes happens, the printer's punctuation obscures the author's meaning. In earlier times, however, printers seem often to have taken much more upon themselves, especially when the author was not actually supervising the work himself, and the possibilities of departure from the manuscript were far greater. We have to consider of what kind and how great these were. There is evidently a very wide range of possibilities. On the one hand a printed text might follow the M.S. in all details of arrangement, spelling, use of capitals and punctuation, with the minute accuracy which we find nowadays, say, in a print of an M.S. for the purposes of palaeographic study; on the other the printed text may represent an elaborately edited version, perhaps broken up into chapters and sections, re-paragraphed, perhaps with side-notes added and with certain words or passages italicized or printed in larger or smaller type to give them greater or less prominence,—and throughout respelt and repunctuated. Between these extremes there are many possible degrees of exactitude without the text having in any case been subjected to deliberate falsification. But it may well be asked, why does it matter to us to know exactly how closely a printed book corresponds to the author's M.S. in things which do not affect his meaning? Would not a text which gives us the words which he used, in the spelling and with the punctuation of our own day, such a text as we might suppose to be taken down by a well- trained shorthand writer from the lips of a medium inspired by Shakespeare's ghost, or, we might say, such a statement as would be compiled by a police sergeant from the utterances of a foreigner speaking broken English—would not such a text—a normalized and modernized text—give us who are of the twentieth century the best and most easily assimilated form of what the sixteenth century writers had to say? And if that is so, what do these questions of exact form matter? Well, for what may be called the purely literary or aesthetic reader perhaps they do not matter much. It is arguable that if we are considering a piece of great literature simply by and for itself, we may obtain as true—or at least for ourselves as forcible—an impression of it from a modernized text as we should from an exact copy of its author's manuscript—perhaps even a truer and more forcible impression because our attention is in no way distracted from the thought itself by extraneous and non-essential difficulties due to unfamiliarity in the method of presentation. It is at least arguable: I do not say it is the truth. But even if it is the truth, it does not alter the fact that this modernized text has had to be constructed, and, as we live in the present day, it must, to satisfy us, have been constructed according to modern critical methods. And these modern critical methods demand the use of every scrap of knowledge that we can obtain as to the transmission of the text from the author's own M.S. downwards, in order that we may be as near certainty as possible that the text which we offer does actually represent what the author intended. Let us just glance for a moment at the history of editorial methods in dealing with the English classics, or for the sake of simplicity, with the text of Shakespeare. It is of course well known to you all that the methods of his earlier editors differed very widely from those of the present day. Such men as Rowe and Pope had as their object rather the production of what they regarded as a good text than one in any sense accurate. They did their best to produce the text which they themselves thought Shakespeare meant to write, or—we might almost say—which in their view he ought to have written. Rowe, besides with great care attending to the scene-divisions and locations, stage directions and other furnishings of the text regarded as necessary in his day—and so successfully that his work in this direction has almost come to be regarded as Shakespeare's own—introduced a number of slight trimmings in the text and corrected many obvious errors. Thus in the first act of Coriolanus the Cambridge editors accept some 15 emendations from Rowe, mostly in punctuation and in minor matters of form such as `Who's' for `Whose', `stands' for `stand'st' (it is at least doubtful if they are right here), `o” for `a' (=of), `they've' for `th'have', and so on. Rowe, and even more Pope, did not indeed so much emend as regularize and modernize, though Rowe attended more particularly to minor details of grammar, while Pope tinkered the verse. This, however, is not the point. What we have to notice at present is that in the alterations made by them they paid little regard to authority; Rowe had, one may guess, a somewhat better sense of Elizabethan English than Pope had, and in many cases his corrections are more likely, but neither seems to have bothered himself much whether a reading was or was not to be found in a quarto or folio, and not at all as to the probable authority of the particular quarto or folio if it happened to be found in one. With the next group, including Theobald, Stevens and Malone, we find a real intention of getting back to what Shakespeare actually wrote, and a very considerable knowledge, derived from the study of the work of his contemporaries, of what he is likely to have written; and at the same time a desire to show wherever possible an authority in some early text for their readings; but as yet there is little serious attempt to determine the respective values of the early texts, nor indeed any clear conception that such determination was possible. This attempt to settle the respective authority of the texts—in those cases where there exists more than a single early one—was the next step, taken by such men as Dyce, the Cambridge Editors and Furnivall. Among the editors of this period there was much discussion of the merits of the quarto texts versus the folio—as if the editorial history of all the quartos was one and the same, and as if the various plays printed in the folio had all gone through identical vicissitudes and their texts were of equal authority. There is of course no reason for any such supposition. In fact, so far as the quartos are concerned we now recognize—thanks to Mr. A. W. Pollard—a very distinct division into good quartos and bad ones, though even so this does not mean that all the good quartos are equally authoritative, or all the bad ones equally to be rejected, and thanks to Professor Dover Wilson and others, we are able to classify the folio plays on the basis of their relationship to the copy used in the theatre and at the same time to detect—or shall I say to suspect —the revisions to which some of them have been subjected by their authors or other persons. The next phase—the one in which we are at present—is not only to work out very carefully the relations between the extant early texts, in order that we may choose one as representing most nearly what Shakespeare wrote, but to attempt in every case where the reading of this text seems to be faulty, to reconstruct the history of the fault, so that by showing how it occurred, or at least how it may have occurred, we can justify our proposed emendation. The problem of error has been at- tacked mainly from two sides. On one the question of handwriting has been studied in order to show how words in the manuscript may have been misread by a copyist or compositor; on the other the processes of printing have been closely investigated in order to ascertain what, if any, mechanical causes might result in errors of text. It is this attempt to explain and justify the readings which are adopted that is the outstanding feature of modern textual criticism. The present day editor is somewhat in the position of a detective who is called in to investigate a burglary, and who thinks it probable, let us suppose, that the burglar entered by a certain first-floor window; but who, before he can assume this as a step in the history of the crime, must for his own satisfaction and credit construct a plausible theory of how the burglar managed to reach that window. He cannot assume that he flew there! He must at least be able to show that the burglar might have climbed by the help of such and such a tree or trellis, or what not, traversed along such and such a ledge, clinging to such and such hand-holds, and so gained his objective. If he is lucky he may be able to prove by marks left during the transit that it was actually thus that the burglar gained entrance, but whether he can do this or not he will at all events have rendered his theory much more convincing to himself and to others by making clear that the method in which he supposes the crime to have been committed is a possible one; and though he may never catch the burglar, he will at least be looked upon as a competent detective. Unfortunately the traces left by a heavy material object such as a burglar are, as a rule, far easier to detect than the development of an error in a text, and we must not press our comparison too far. But nevertheless our textual detective may be able to show at what point in the transmission of his text an error is likely to have entered, the stages of its progress and even in some cases the marks left on the neighbouring phrases, in the form of compensatory adjustments, by its passage and development. It will indeed usually be but a theory—a possibility, but it will certainly render the emendation which he proposes far more satisfactory and convincing, both to himself and to his readers, than if he had put it forward as a mere unsupported guess. Now in order that an editor may be in a position to form a reasonable theory of how what he considers to be an error in the text before him may have arisen, it is evidently necessary that he should have as exact and minute a knowledge as possible of the various stages through which the text is likely to have passed from its first being written down by the hand of its author until its appearance in a printed book, and of all the circumstances by which it may have been affected during these stages. He must know, that is to say, so far as possible, what relation his printed text was intended to bear, and is likely to have borne, to his author's M.S. He must consider whether there are any rules which will assist him, or any limitations to which he must conform, in his attempts to justify his proposed readings. He may find that in textual criticism neither rules nor limitations are of universal application or of universal validity; he may indeed find that in the particular case under investigation neither rules nor limitations can be formulated; but until he has investigated the matter, he cannot be said to have done all that modern critical methods require of him. Now in these lectures I have nothing very new or very remarkable to put before you. Everyone who has given much time to the study of sixteenth and seventeenth century texts must already be familiar with a great part of the ground which I have to cover. All I hope to do is to offer you a little more methodical survey of the whole subject than, so far as I know, exists at present, and one which may perhaps make the problem of emendation, in certain respects, a little clearer. I cannot claim that the investigation which I propose to make will lead to any immediate and positive results of great importance. It will certainly not lead us to the discovery of any new and startling emendations of obscure passages. On the other hand I am not without hope that it will suggest certain new factors which must be taken into account in textual work and certain new lines of investigation which may eventually bring us nearer to the truth. Perhaps also it will suggest that the problem of emendation is very different in different classes of texts; that on the whole sixteenth and seventeenth century printers were not nearly so unreliable as some critics have supposed and that the evidence of the printed book is not lightly to be set aside; and that, in short, emendation is a risky business and that in most cases it is best to let well, or even moderately well, alone. We are all of course far less given to reckless emendation of early texts than critics were a century ago, but I cannot help feeling that we still at times expect from writers of the Shakespearian period a standard of correctness in grammar, of clarity of thought and precision in statement that we certainly do not always find in the writers of our own day. There is, I think, no evidence whatever to justify us in any such expectation, and we must always before assuming that a text is erroneous do our utmost to interpret it as it stands. It may often seem to us that quite a small change would greatly improve the grammar of a passage or give it a new and much more effective point, and we are sorely tempted to emend it accordingly; but there is of course not the slightest ground for so doing. We may often find exactly the same thing in the work of our own day, when we have every reason for believing that the printed text was carefully revised by the author and represents what he intended. Anyone who has had to read other people's proofs in the capacity of a sub-editor or printer's reader will recall many instances where he has felt certain that his author had intended to say something else—so obvious did a correction seem—and then on being challenged the author has refused the suggested alteration and maintained the passage as it stood. It must therefore always be our first rule to go as far with the printed text as we possibly can, only assuming it to be wrong when we can find no sense in it by any reasonable interpretation, or—in a play—by any method of enunciation or by the interpolation of any imaginable stage business. From such general considerations we must now pass to the question of the transmission of a text from the original M.S. of its author to the printed page. It is evident that there may be several stages in this transmission, for we can seldom, if ever, be certain that the compositor who set a work in type had the author's original M.S. before him. He may equally well have worked from a transcript, possibly made by a professional scribe, and perhaps prepared by the latter for press. It is, therefore, necessary that, before we come to the actual process of composition in type, we should consider the nature of the copy which the printer is likely to have had before him—I am using `copy' in the technical sense of the M.S. from which a compositor works—and how closely this copy is likely to correspond with what the author originally wrote. There are three principal ways in which copy given to a printer may vary—in legibility, in correctness, and in the extent to which it has been prepared for the press. The last might include division into chapters, sections and paragraphs, the marking of passages for special type and such matters, and in the case of plays the careful and consistent insertion of speakers' names and the like, which an author is usually content to give in very much abbreviated forms. It is obvious that the copy which was brought to the printing houses might vary much in these respects according to the carefulness of the author or to other circumstances. Now as regards legibility, I think we may take it for granted that an author who himself sent his M.S. to be printed would take some care that it could be read. If his own hand was too bad he would no doubt get a fair copy made. He would do as Fulke Greville did when he had a secretary write to his friend, Michael Hickes in 1600, remarking “I write in another mans hande for feare my owne will not be understood;” and it is reasonable to suppose that when the fair copy was made, he would read it over to see that it was correct—though we do at times find excuses made for errors on the ground that they crept in when the work was copied and made ready for the press. On the other hand it seems not infrequently to have happened that books were printed from MSS. which had come into the possession of publishers without their authors' knowledge or consent. There undoubtedly existed a trade in M.S. copies of unprinted works. Nashe refers to a pamphlet of his as progressing from one scrivener's shop to another and growing at length so common that it was ready to be hung out for one of their signs, like a pair of indentures. Whereupon he thought it as good to reap the fruits of his own labours, by having the book printed, as for the copyists to make their profit out of it. One can easily understand that a work copied and re-copied in this way might in the course of time become seriously corrupt, but it would be quite a mistake to suppose that such trade copies would either be badly written or contain passages of unintelligible nonsense. The fact that they were the work of professional scribes would ensure that they were clear and legible, and unless they afforded a readable text they would not easily sell. However much the publication might be surreptitious and unauthorized, and however they might misrepresent the author's original, such professional copies would from the printer's point of view be excellent, and we should expect a text set up from them to be quite free from errors due to misreading. Again we must remember that the majority of books had to be licensed before publication. The licensing regulations varied from time to time, and there is some obscurity as to the details of the working of the system, but it is, I think, fair to say that, with a very small number of exceptions, all books openly printed during the reigns of Elizabeth, James 1st. and Charles 1st. had been read or at least looked at by some person representing the licensing authorities, though we must not forget that it was religious and political works about which these authorities principally concerned themselves, and that it seems likely that, at certain periods, books regarded as safe might be allowed by the Master and Wardens of the Stationers Company without reference to any other authority. Now we can surely assume that no one who wanted to get a book licensed would present it to the licenser, whoever he might be, in an illegible form. If he could not write decently himself, he would get it transcribed. Thus Henry Chettle tells us that he transcribed Robert Greene's Groatsworth of Wit, which had been left by Greene at his death. As he says, `it was ill written, as sometimes Greene's hand was none of the best: licensed it must be, ere it could be printed, which could never be if it might not be read. To be brief, I writ it over, and as near as I could, followed the copy.' Here we have an admirably plain statement of what happened in one particular case. A fair copy was required for the licenser, and though this is not actually stated, it is im- plied that this was the copy which was afterwards printed from, for Chettle's purpose is to make clear that he had no share in the work save as copyist, and that though he omitted a few passages, he added not a word of his own. It all seems very reasonable and natural, and I think we may take it as a general rule that a legible copy would be submitted to the licenser and that this legible copy would afterwards be used by the compositor for putting the work into type. Now, as everyone knows, a compositor in the course of his employment becomes extraordinarily skilled in deciphering handwritings, even when these are very difficult to an ordinary reader. There is, so far as I can see, no reason for supposing an Elizabethan compositor to have been less skilled in reading the MSS of his own day than a modern one, or to have been less skilled than the licenser. I cannot help feeling that because we cannot read an Elizabethan M.S. as easily as one in a present day script, we are sometimes a little inclined to imagine that it would have presented difficulties to an Elizabethan. Of course it would not, and taking into account the necessity of the licenser being able to read it, I think we may fairly assume that as a general rule a MS. sent to a printing house in the sixteenth or seventeenth century would present less rather than more difficulty to the compositor than would the average handwritten MS. sent to a printer at the present day. Was there an exception to this general rule of the goodness of the copy sent to the printer? I think there was, a most important one, and one which, besides giving infinite trouble to students of English literature ever since, is mainly responsible for the very low opinion which is generally held of the work of the Elizabethan printer. This exception was the text of a certain class of popular plays. I believe that the copy supplied to the printer in the case of such popular plays is likely to have been far less satisfactory from his point of view than the copy supplied for any other class of book, for a very simple reason, namely that he would not, as a general rule, get the licenser's fair copy to work from. What I suggest was the history of most plays of the popular kind—plays which did not get into print until some time after their original performance on the stage—is this. The author produced a MS. If he was a bad writer, like Robert Greene, or in any case if the MS. showed the ordinary traces of revision and correction during composition, a copy was written out professionally for the licenser to pass. When this was passed by the licenser it would be used by the theatrical producer as what I may call the official copy. It would in fact become the prompt copy, and would be provided with the usual prompter's notes, to which I shall refer later. It would of course be essential that the prompter should have a copy which was both correct and legible, for he could not afford to be puzzling over it when an actor had forgotten his lines, and, with the frequent variation in repertory, prompting must have been very necessary on the Elizabethan stage. Now, if a theatrical company decided to let a play be printed, and there is at least some reason for thinking that a good many plays were actually sold to the publishers by the companies that owned them, it is not to be supposed that as a general rule they would hand over the prompter's copy to the compositor, for this was valuable to them both for use in the theatre and as their authorization for acting the play. On the other hand it does not seem to have been necessary for a play which had been licensed for acting to be separately licensed for printing. Consequently there would be no question of producing a fresh fair copy for the licenser. It seems therefore highly probable that if the company still possessed the author's original MS. they would hand over this, which might easily be full of corrections, not too legible, and altogether bad from the point of view of the compositor. Now if this were done it would at once give us a reason why the texts of the popular drama are often so much below the general level of printing of their time. Dramatic texts claim so large a share of the attention of students at the present time that I must be permitted to consider them a little more closely, though we must always remember that, important as they are to us to-day, they were regarded by the Elizabethan book-buying and book-selling public as essentially a rather low-class kind of literature, and that the better publishers and printers concerned themselves hardly at all with such work. This, however, is by the way; what concerns us at the moment is the copy which would be supplied to the printer of a dramatic text. Naturally it varied a great deal. Certain plays, especially those intended for the study rather than for the theatre, such as those of Samuel Daniel, would no doubt be printed under the author's supervision from MSS. which he had himself supplied, and there is no reason to expect any different degree of correctness in the printing of such plays from poems or even sermons. In other cases an author took an evident pride in his work, and though the plays were written for the theatre, saw to the publication himself—such as Ben Jonson. But it is not such as these which give trouble to an editor, but the more popular class of play which came into print after, and because of, its success on the boards, and with the publication of which the author seems to have had nothing to do. The importance of this class entirely overshadows that of the others because it happens that the plays of Shakespeare as well as those of most of his predecessors and earlier contemporaries are included in it. It may have struck you that in suggesting, as I did just now, that the texts of this class of play—or at any rate the inferior texts—owe their inferiority to their not having been printed from licensers' copies, which were retained by the theatrical companies as prompt-books, I am entirely at variance with much recent critical work which has been directed to showing that certain plays of Shakespeare were actually printed from these prompt-books. Thus of the first quarto of A Midsummer Night's Dream, 1600, Prof. Dover Wilson says: “The Fisher Quarto was beyond doubt printed from a theatrical prompt-book. Stage directions, for example, such as `Enter the King of Fairies, at one doore, with his traine; and the Queene, at another, with hers,' transport us at once from the forest of Shakespeare's Attica to the boards of his play-house; while in others like `ly doune,' `sleepe' and `winde horne' we hear the managerial voice giving real `directions' to the players. Further, seeing that the Quarto contains a number of irregularities strongly suggestive of an author's manuscript, it seems not unnatural to suppose that here, as with Much Ado, 1600 and Love's Labour's Lost, 1598 we are once again confronted with a text printed directly from the prompt book just as Shakespeare left it.” Now without wishing to deny that certain of the early quartos do contain things, such as an occasional mention of an actor's name in a stage direction, as in Much Ado and the second part of Henry IV, which undoubtedly seem to indicate that the MSS from which they were printed had a very close connection with the actual performance at the theatre, I think that we must be careful in assuming that such occasional notes as these prove them to have been the official copy used by the prompter; and still less need we assume that the mere presence of a few stage directions written from the theatrical point of view proves this. Although I hesitate to differ from so sound and careful an editor as Professor Dover Wilson, I cannot but think that he has not given quite sufficient consideration to the essential nature of a prompt-book. Surely, as I have said already, a book used by the prompter to hold in his hand while directing a performance, must have been correct and easily read or it would have been useless. And yet unless we are to assume an altogether abnormal carelessness or stupidity on the part of the compositor of the quarto which he is discussing, the copy from which it was printed cannot have been by any means clear and legible. To take a single example, there is at the end of the first scene a passage which is consistently rhymed. In the course of four lines of this we find two obvious errors in the rhyme-words: `sweld' rhyming with `meet' where `sweet' is evidently needed, and `companions' rhyming with `eyes' where `companies' seems a certain correction. Both these errors Professor Wilson puts down, no doubt rightly, to misreading of the copy. But of what use, in the uncertain lights of a theatre, would have been a prompt-copy in the decipher- ing of which a compositor constantly employed in the reading of handwriting could make such blunders. For my own part, I quite fail to see that the occurrence of occasional stage directions such as Professor Wilson cites, implies a prompt-copy in the sense of a copy to be actually used on the stage. All it does seem to me to imply is a play written for the stage by a man who knew his job, and who continually regarded it as a play to be performed and not one to be read in the study. Shakespeare, as any other competent dramatist does, would see in his mind's eye his characters moving on the stage of his theatre, and would, I think, quite naturally and instinctively add such occasional notes as would serve to make his intention clear to a producer, without intending anything like a full set of directions. I am not sure that he might not even sometimes have accidentally slipped in, for the name of a character, that of the actor by whom he knew—as he well might—that the character was to be played. And, besides, we do occasionally find plays which seem really to have been printed from prompt copies, or from exact transcripts of them, and here we find quite another sort of stage direction. Thus in the Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647, The Spanish Curate seems to have been printed from a prompt-copy. But here we get directions in advance which are quite clearly intended as warnings to the producer. Thus in Act IV, scene 5, at the head of the scene is `Diego ready in bed, wine, cup,' though Diego does not enter until 40 lines later, where the direction reads, rather quaintly, `Enter Diego (in a bed)' with the addition a line later `Bed thrust out,' the actual process evidently being that the curtain of the inner stage was drawn revealing Diego in a bed, and the bed was then pushed forward on to the stage itself. Later in the same play we find such directions as `Chaire and stooles out,' `A Table ready covered with Cloath Napkins Salt Trenchers and Bread,' and `Dishes covered with papers in each ready.' These two last directions have nothing whatever to do with the matter in hand at the moment, and refer to a meal which is to take place in the following scene. Now such directions as these are real prompter's notes. Further, in texts of this kind we always find that entries of characters are given two or three lines before their actual appearance on the stage. At the same time we may observe that such texts printed from undoubted prompters' copies show few, if any, of the kind of errors which indicate an illegible or corrupt manuscript. They belong of course to a later period when plays were no doubt regarded as a more important branch of literature than at the end of the sixteenth century and were printed with more care, but even with all due allowance for this the fact is perhaps not without significance. The case of the M.S. of Massinger's Believe as you List is perhaps rather late to afford much evidence in this connection but it may be mentioned in passing. Here we have a play which was fair copied by the author himself and was evidently prepared for actual stage-use by a theatrical producer and directions added on the MS. itself by a prompter. Among these are such purely prompters' notes as `Gascoigne and Herbert below ready to open the Trap doore for Mr. Taylor' and a little later Antiochus, the character played by Mr. Taylor, is to be `ready: under the stage.' Elsewhere an actor and a boy are to be `ready: for the song at the Arras' and so on, while at the end of the play is added a short list of certain properties required for the different acts; thus a writing out of the book with a small piece of silver for Mr. Swantton (i.e. Swanston) is required for the first act, and so on. This then is clearly a copy to be actually used by the producer or prompter, and it is noteworthy that it is well and very legibly written and a perfectly good text. It seems to me evident that the copy from which A Midsummer Night's Dream was printed was a very different sort of thing from this, not a prompt-copy at all but far more probably Shakespeare's own original draft. Now what should we expect a sixteenth century playwright's copy of a play as supplied to a theatrical company to be like? Let us remember its purpose. It was not written to be printed. It was not a document intended for the study or for the minute discussion of students three hundred years away in the future. It was not a literary document at all. It was merely the substance—or rather the bare bones—of a performance on the stage, a thing to be interpreted by expert actors used to declaiming blank verse, and, we may presume, understanding thoroughly what was required of them. With actors so well trained by constant change of repertory as the Elizabethan actors were, it is quite likely that in the less important scenes a good deal of extemporization would be allowed and expected—as it certainly was on some of the foreign stages—and it is even possible that for such scenes a mere direction as to what was required to happen might sometimes have been regarded as sufficient. If so, it would perhaps explain the exceeding crudity of some of the comic scenes of the popular drama which may have been hastily written up from such directions at the time of printing. And even in those scenes where the author expected the actors to utter his language word for word as written, the fact that he was writing for skilled exponents would, I think, inevitably lead him to be satisfied with a much lower standard of exactness than if he had been writing for print. When an actor has to speak a passage of blank verse he will, in the first place, so utter it that it scans. He will make such a word as `blessed' either two syllables or one as the verse seems to require. He will make his own punctuation. He will run lines together or split them in the middle as the rhythm of the speech demands. He will, in fact, speak his author's words as he thinks they ought to be spoken, rather than exactly as the author has set them down, and in this he will be fulfilling the author's intention. The author, for his part, would be concerned merely with giving him things to speak, and this being so would not attempt an exactitude and finish in his MS. which would at best be useless. So far as accurate division into lines of verse, or punctuation, was necessary at all, this could be attended to in the fair copy which, in my view, would generally have to be made for the censor of plays and to serve as a prompt-copy. The production of such a fair copy from the author's draft was, I take it, the business of a man like Ralph Crane, who was scrivener to the King's Players. He had, no doubt, just the kind of experience necessary to decipher and put into order the playwright's untidy and often much revised draft and if only such fair copies of the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries had gone to press, we should all have been spared a vast deal of trouble. If then, as I have suggested, when the theatrical companies sent their plays to be printed, they did not send them official prompters' copies, but the—to them—far less valuable original manuscripts, should we not expect to get just the sort of muddle which we actually find? The compositor faced with a MS. which was not—as most MSS. to some extent were—prepared for press, and without the experience which would enable an actor, or a theatrical copyist, at once to decide which words were intended to stand in contracted forms and which to be expanded, which passages were prose and which blank verse, how the lines were intended to be divided up, and so on, would no doubt do the best he could, but especially if the copy were hastily written and much revised would in all probability make at times a sorry hash of it. Of course, such a theory will not explain everything. It will not explain, for example, the apparent omission of essential scenes in Peele's Edward I, though this may be due simply to parts of the copy having been lost or damaged; but, as I shall hope to convince you, the sixteenth century printer had a far higher standard of accuracy than one who had only studied the texts of popular plays might suppose, and it seems necessary to attempt to account in some way for the extraordinary difference in correctness between the printing of such plays and the printing of most other kinds of work. The mere fact that a compositor had a play before him cannot have caused his work suddenly to fall so far below its usual standard. The fault must have been in the copy rather than in the compositor. And if all other work sent to the printer was in the form of fair copies sufficiently good to have been submitted to the licenser, whereas these popular plays came to him not in fair copies but in the author's MS. as originally supplied to the theatrical manager, with all the author's corrections and alterations upon them, we do seem to have at least a possible explanation of the difference in the printed results. After this long digression, let us get back to the ordinary copy which would be supplied to the printer of non-dramatic work. For reasons that I have given, I think this would be as a general rule decently and clearly written whether in the hand of the author or of a copyist. There is no need to suppose that the average author employed a copyist to put his work into order and transcribe it for the press, but it is likely enough that some did this, and as such a fair copy is a possible step between the author's MS. and the printed book, it is necessary to deal with it briefly here. The fair-copying, just as the printing, might of course introduce errors. Thus, Robert Cleaver in his Brief Explanation of... the Proverbs of Solomon, 1615, apologises for faults which were committed “some when the copie was written out and made ready for the presse, and other committed in the printing.” But besides the introduction of errors a copyist might influence the transmission of the text in another very important way, namely, by varying the original spelling. Perhaps I ought to apologize for the fact that I shall have to talk at some length about spelling. It sounds a dull subject, and I fancy that most people's—indeed most English students'—idea concerning the spelling of the Shakespearian period is simply that it was quite irregular and therefore does not matter. It was irregular, but we are finding out that it matters a great deal, and of late much work has been directed to investigating it. The enquiry has generally been made in connection with printed texts—whether or not, or to what extent, the compositor followed or tended to follow, consciously or unconsciously, the spelling, and incidentally the punctuation of the copy before him. I shall have to refer to this question in connection with the compositor when we come to him, but at the moment we are only considering the work in its manuscript state and our problem is, if one Elizabethan—professional scribe or not—copied another Elizabethan's MS. would he naturally and normally follow his spelling and punctuation, or would he follow his own habits as regards these things? It is a great mistake to suppose that because sixteenth century spelling was apparently haphazard, and most words can in different books be found spelt in a great variety of ways, that therefore the spelling of any particular sixteenth century writer was necessarily haphazard. The spelling of a man who had occasion to write but seldom, might indeed be haphazard—as it often is to-day—but in anyone who spent a great part of his time in such an occupation it must always have become a matter of more or less fixed habit. We should expect a professional author's spell- ing to become as individual a peculiarity as his style, while it is of course far more easily detected and described. We have only to look at any MS. of some length to see that this is the case. The spelling will, no doubt, not approach in regularity that of the present day, especially in the less common words, but we shall as a rule find that in all those which are of frequent occurrence one or other of the alternative spellings will be given the preference throughout. Thus, towards the end of the sixteenth century, there were at least four ways of spelling the word “friend;” namely `frend,' `frind,' `freend,' and as we spell it at present; there was also an occasional form “freind.' We shall, I think, generally find that a writer chooses one of these forms and sticks to it. Other common words of which the same thing may be said are `her', spelt either with `e' or `i,' and `these' which may be either `these' or `theis,' but I shall have to refer to such test-words later and this must suffice for the present. The point is that at a period when spelling was not fixed by general consent it was, in practice, fixed for the individual, and indeed as characteristic as handwriting or literary style. In fact I think we may say that if instead of printed plays we possessed letter for letter transcripts of the original manuscripts of the authors, we should in most cases be able to assign anonymous plays to their authors, or to divide them up among several authors, on the ground of spelling alone. It is therefore evidently of importance to us to know whether or not we are entitled to argue from the spellings which we find either in MS. copies of works not in their authors' hands or in printed texts, anything as to the spelling of the author's original manuscripts, and hence in the case of anonymous works, anything as to the identity of the author or the respective shares of the different contributors to such works. But there are other ways in which the textual critic may be concerned with spelling, for it is obvious that the possibility of confusion and error either by miswriting or misreading depends to a great extent on spelling. Let us take one or two simple examples. Among the commonest misreadings, in early times as now, is that of `any' for `my' or vice versa. Now in the later 16th. century `any' was very commonly spelt `anie' but `my' was rarely, if ever, spelt `mie'. If therefore an author was in the habit of spelling `anie' the word `my' in a manuscript copy or text printed from his MS. is not at all likely to be a misreading for that word, whereas if he spelt `any' such a misreading might very easily occur. But in the great majority of cases we have no original MS. of our author from which we can learn his practice as regards spelling, and it therefore becomes important to ascertain what, if anything, we are entitled to infer as to this from the copies of his work in other hands, or from the printed text before us. In this particular case would the fact that `anie' was commonly spelt with -ie in the derived text which we are considering, imply that this was the author's customary spelling of the word or would it not? Or again suppose that we find in a text the word `science' where it seems to us that the correct word would be `silence.' Now the spelling of `silence' with `sc' is by no means uncommon in the 16th. century and we might easily suppose that the author wrote it so. If then our transcriber (or printer as the case may be) were in the habit of keeping the spelling which he saw before him, it would be easy to explain the word `science' by supposing that he intended to write (or compose) `scilence' with `sc' and that an `l' was simply omitted by accident. If, however, he were in the habit of normalizing the spelling and of spelling `silence' as we do nowadays, the presence of the word `science' is much less easily accounted for. It must in fact have been an actual misreading and not a very natural one. This will, I think, suffice to indicate why we are concerned to know how closely a copyist is likely to have followed his original in matters of detail such as spelling. This particular point has so far received little attention, though as I have already mentioned, the very similar question of whether a compositor followed the spelling of his copy has received a good deal. Fortunately, thanks to the work of Mr. F. P. Wilson, we have recently learnt much about one of these professional scribes, namely Ralph Crane, who was born, in all probability, between 1550 and 1560, and who died some time after 1632. Crane was in his early days secretary to the Clerk of the Privy Council and later served in the Signet Office and the Privy Seal, and as he tells us in 1621 he was employed as scrivener to the King's Players. Up to the present five plays and six other manuscripts have been identified as written by Crane and these, if carefully examined, should give us a fairly good idea of the relationship of at least one transcriber to his text. The plays existing in transcripts by Crane are the following: The Tragedy of Sir John van Olden Barnavelt, believed to be the work of Fletcher and Massinger; Demetrius and Enanthe by Fletcher; The Witch by Middleton, and A Game at Chess by Middleton, the last existing in two different versions. We have thus four plays, the work of three authors. Whose spelling will the transcripts represent? Fortunately in Miss Frijlinck's edition of Barnavelt from the Crane MS. we have a very convenient means of studying the spelling of one of these MSS. with a minimum of trouble. This spelling is not unremarkable, and I think it may safely be said that it looks more like the spelling of one who had received his education in the neighbourhood of 1570 than that of men who were not born until nine or thirteen years after that date as were Fletcher and Massinger. Among spellings that were undoubtedly antiquated or unusual in 1619, the presumed date of the transcript, are `ceize' for `sieze', `falce' for `false', `praire' for `prayer', `speritt' for `spirit', and in perhaps a less degree `ghesse' for `guesse' and `creadit' for `credit', and there are a number of other peculiarities with which I need not trouble you. Now the interesting point is that this spelling is consistent or practically so throughout the play; so far at least as I can see, it is absolutely impossible to differentiate the two authors of the play by any difference in the spelling of their respective portions. Assuming, as I think we safely may, that the spelling of the two authors Massinger and Fletcher was not identical, we must either suppose that Crane transcribed the play not from the original MS. of their separate portions but from a fair copy in which the spelling had been normalized, or alternatively that it was Crane's own. It would be interesting if we could bring the spelling into any relation with either Massinger's of Fletcher's, for obviously one of these might have copied it out incorporating the contributions of the other. Comparison with `Believe as you List' which is accepted as in Massinger's own hand does not show any general similarity in spelling, but we cannot positively say that it is not Fletcher's for we have no autograph of his with which to compare it. On the other hand we have several other plays transcribed by Crane and by a careful examination of these we ought to be able to discover whether he followed his own system of spelling or not. Unfortunately I have not been able to make any thorough investigation of the matter—some of the Crane MSS. are not very easily accessible—but examination of the MS. of the Game at Chess in the British Museum (Lansdowne 690) reveals a considerable number of the peculiar spellings found in Barnavelt, such as the spelling of `sieze' with a `c'—surely a most unusual form, `praire' for `prayer' and `falce' with a `c' for `false.' We find also at least once `safety' spelt `saffetie' as in Barnavelt, while certain less unusual spellings such as `secreat' for `secret', `frend' for `friend' seem to be used consistently throughout both plays. On the other hand there are a few differences. The word `spirit' seems always in Barnavelt to be spelt `sperit'—this occurs at least seven times in the play—whereas in A Game at Chess (about 1624) and in Middleton's Witch (not before 1620) of which there exists a not very accurate eighteenth century print, the word seems to be usually spelt `spirit' as now. Again the spelling of `her' seems in Barnavelt to be always with `i' and in the Game at Chess and the Witch with `e'. It is not easy to account for these variations, and I feel that fuller investigation is required before we can say with complete confidence that Crane entirely ignored the spelling of the copy before him and followed his own—but so far as the evidence goes it seems to show that he had at least a very strong tendency to do this. If so, the fact is of some importance for it means that in anything printed from a fair copy made by Crane the spellings will not be those of the author, and if this is true of the work of one professional scribe it may well be true of the work of others. One final word before we leave the subject of MS. copies. I would suggest for your consideration that in the relation of a transcript to its original, the following general principles are likely to be found valid.— (1) The more a man writes the more would his spelling tend to become fixed. Therefore a copy made by a professional scribe is likely to be more thoroughly and consistently re-spelt than a copy made by one who was not a professional. (2) Traces of the author's spelling are always more likely to be found in unfamiliar words, proper names and the like, than in common ones, for the transcriber's notion of how to spell such words is likely to be less fixed. (3) A transcript made from difficult writing will be more likely to preserve traces of original spellings than a transcript from more easily legible writing, because the more the transcriber's attention is focussed on the actual form of the words which he transcribes the more exactly is he likely to reproduce them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II In the last lecture we were considering the kind of copy from which books of the Elizabethan period were set up, and we found reason for thinking that in the case of most classes of work the fact that a book before being printed had to be submitted to the licensers would ensure the production of a good and legible copy and that this copy would as a rule be the copy from which the compositor worked. It might be in the author's own hand, or it might be in that of a copyist. In the latter case, especially if it was written by a professional scribe, it would probably be even easier for the compositor to work from than if it were in the hand of the author, but we cannot count on its preserving the author's spelling or punctuation or following it in minor details. In the case of one class of work, however—the popular play—the compositor instead of having a carefully written fair-copy to work from, might, because it was not necessary that the work should be submitted to the licenser before printing, be given a rough or careless transcript, or much more probably the author's original manuscript, in some cases much revised. If this were done the compositor would naturally be at a great disadvantage and would be likely to produce work of the unusually low standard that we often find in the texts of such plays. In to-day's lecture we shall have to consider the work of the compositor and must enquire how closely we should expect him to follow the MS. before him, not only in matters of general arrangement, but in the details of spelling and punctuation. As regards matters of general arrangement, by which I mean the division of the work into chapters or sections, the marking of portions intended to be given special prominence by the use of large type or italics, the provision of side notes intended to summarize the matter of the text or to act as a running commentary, and the like—in fact the sort of sub-editing which often has to be done nowadays in publishing-houses for authors devoid of technical knowledge—of all this, as regards the Elizabethan period, we know very little. The indications, such as they are, seem to point to all such work as this being done in the preparation of the fair copy, before the MS. went to the licenser or the printing- house. As is well known, in the larger Continental printing-houses scholars of eminence were often employed as correctors of the press, and it seems reasonable to suppose that their duties may have included a good deal of work that we would call editorial, but so far as I am aware there is no evidence of anyone being connected with a sixteenth or seventeenth century press in this country in what we may call an editorial capacity, or even, save in the King's Printing-house, as a proof-reader. We can only suppose that whatever was done in the printing-house towards putting a work into final order for the compositor was done by the master-printer and was in the main of a technical nature. We may therefore turn at once to the question of spelling and consider what the compositor's practice was likely to be as regards this. Did he attempt to follow the MS. before him in spelling, in the use of capitals and italics and in punctuation, exactly, or did he re-spell, recapitalize, and repunctuate in accordance with general rules obtaining in all printing-houses of the date, or with special rules peculiar to the printing-house in which he worked—as was done in later times—or lastly, did each compositor follow a system of his own? One thing alone is certain, that a man who spent his life in composition must have had some system. If he did not follow the text before him he must have had some regularly established practice in his mind—whether the rule of the craft, or of the house or one peculiar to himself. No one who works long at any particular task can avoid the establishment of a routine—to hesitate over every word in order to select one out of a variety of possible spellings would have meant an intolerable waste of time. The history of English spelling has yet to be written and I certainly do not propose to try to write it, but there are, I think, one or two things which may be said about it as concerns my particular subject. In the first place although in the sixteenth century there was certainly nothing of the nature of a printers' standard spelling, yet on the whole the spelling of printed books seems at all times to be more regular than that of manuscripts of the same date, or perhaps I should say we meet in printed books fewer seriously abnormal forms. Especially towards the end of the century, after about 1580, do we find a tendency to greater regularity, at least in the work of the better printing houses; and after about 1600 save for certain conventional variations in the use of mute `e' etc. which, as I shall explain later were necessary for technical reasons, spelling becomes in such houses almost regular. Now there are two things which would prevent a compositor of the Elizabethan period from following his copy exactly. The first is, I believe, imaginary, but I must nevertheless say a few words about it; the second is quite real and important but is limited in its effects. As to the first. It has been argued that it was the custom for compositors in the early printing-houses to have the copy read aloud to them. Of course, if they set up in this way, from dictation, there could be no possibility of their following the spelling of the copy, for they would never even see it. But what is the evidence? Frankly little more than that we find a certain number of errors in early books which can be more easily explained as due to mis hearing than to mis reading. I have mentioned some of these elsewhere and need not repeat them now: the most striking is perhaps the heading of one of Harington's epigrams which, as first printed, appeared as: To Bassifie, his wife's mother, when she was angry. whereas the heading should read, as it does in later editions, and, I believe, in some copies of the original one: To pacify his wife's mother, when she was angry. As `Bassifie' has a capital and is in roman type, whereas the rest of the heading is italic, there can be no doubt whatever that the printer took it for a proper name. It is certainly hard to see how such a mistake could arise from misreading the MS., whereas it might easily be due to mishearing, especially if the person dictating the passage happened to suffer from adenoids or a heavy cold. Another, less comic, example of the apparent result of dictation, but one which is perhaps equally good as evidence is to be found in Shakespeare's Richard II, I.i.139, which two copies of the first quarto give as “Ah but ere I last receiude the Sacrament”. The “Ah” with which the line begins is obviously an unwanted addition and as Mr Pollard has remarked, “could hardly have crept in from any other cause than our English habit of making strange noises, now generally “Er”, between our sentences.” It seems indeed hardly likely that it should have arisen through a compositor's misreading. At the same time it is but fair to say that Mr Pollard's explanation has not been universally accepted, for it has been suggested that the writer of the original MS. may have been going to write “And” in place of “But” and have then changed his mind and struck out the word “And” in such a way as to make it look like “Ah”. This also is possible, though personally I doubt it, for in that case he would probably have written “But” with a capital, and his intention would thus have been made clear to the compositor. To the evidence derived from a few passages such as this—some half-dozen in all, I think, have been put forward in support of the dictation theory—must be added one definite statement of an early eighteenth century writer, J. C. Zeltner. But there is no indication of the source of his statement and I see no reason for thinking that Zeltner in 1716 was much better placed for knowing the practice of the early printing-houses than we are today. It seems at least possible that his account of the reading of copy aloud to compositors may be due to some confusion with a practice which we must suppose, from its obvious convenience, to have been common in the offices of scriveners and copyists of the fifteenth century as it was in those of the writers of news-letters in the seventeenth and eighteenth, of dictating matter to a large number of writers working simultaneously, in order to obtain many copies of a document in the shortest possible time—but this of course is a very different thing. It is, indeed, hard to see of what use dictation would be as a general rule. It would take up the time of two workmen instead of one and it is very doubtful if it would have enabled the compositor to make more rapid progress. No doubt in special circumstances, when the light was bad or a compositor had imperfect eyesight, help might have been given by reading the MS. aloud to him, and such occasional assistance would, I think, amply account for the few apparent instances of errors due to mishearing that we find. Had dictation been anything like a universal practice it could hardly have failed to leave some trace in the early drawings of compositors at work, whereas in every one that is now known the compositor appears to be working from a MS. set up in front of him. I think, therefore, that we may definitely reject composition from dictation as a possible obstacle in the way of a compositor following his copy exactly. There was, however, one very important consideration which did actually make it impossible, at any rate in a work printed in prose, for a compositor to follow the spelling of his copy exactly, however much he desired to do this. As you are of course aware, the lines of print in a prose text, in all but the earliest printed books, end evenly, whereas in all but a few languages such as Chinese, the length of words and syllables is quite irregular. The compositor has therefore so to arrange his lines of type, by varying the spacing between the words, that the end of a word, or of a syllable (plus a hyphen), shall fall at the end of each line. In recent times this has been effected by the provision of spaces of various breadths, for it is possible to vary the space between words very greatly without their looking either too close together or too far apart. In early printing, however, where fewer different widths of spaces seem to have been used, and where the spacing in general was much closer than it is at present, other methods of making the lines of type end evenly— justifying them as it is called—were necessary. In Latin books a variety of contractions, borrowed from the M.S. practice, were available, and a printer could make so much use of these that he had little difficulty in justifying his lines. When, however, it came to the printing of vernacular languages, the printers were faced with the difficulty that only a few of the Latin contractions—such as the long mark over a vowel to indicate the omission of a following `m' or `n', and the contractions for con- and per-, were applicable, and there were hardly any vernacular ones recognised apart from the contractions for a few small words such as `the,' `that,' `which' (ex.: y e , y t , w h ). Fortunately, however, unlike Latin, English had no fixed spelling. Such a word as `man' might either be spelt with three letters as we spell it now or as `manne' with five; the termination -less could either be -les or -lesse; `change' could be spelt either with `a' or `au,' and so on. Here, obviously, was a means ready to hand of filling out their lines to the right length, and the printers took full advantage of it. All through the early period of printing, say till the middle of the seventeenth century, this variation in spelling, principally by the omission or use of mute `e' (with a doubled consonant before it when the preceding vowel was short) was the printer's chief method of justifying his lines, and to this extent he was of course obliged to ignore the spelling of his copy. When, therefore, we talk of a printer following the spelling of his author, or failing to do so, it must be understood that we are not referring to such things as the use or omission of mute `e,' contracted forms, or simple alternative spellings such as change with `a' or `au,' which were necessary to enable him to fill out his lines to the correct length; any more than we should now charge him with failing to follow his author's copy exactly because he had paid no attention to the varying amount of space which the writer had left between his words. All such variations then as `man' and `manne' are merely mechanical devices of no significance and in our further discussion will be ignored. It may of course be said that many other variations of spelling besides those which I have mentioned, vary the length of the word, and I may be asked whether all such variations might not be similarly used in justification and be equally non-significant. The answer is that they might be so used, but as a general rule they were not. To refer again to a word which I mentioned in my former lecture as having several spellings in sixteenth century English, namely the word `friend,' the four spellings in comon use, namely those with `i,' `e,' `ie' and `ee' differ in length, and there is no doubt that the choice of one rather than another might occasionally be due to the necessity of fitting the word into the line. But if we examine a text for this word we shall, I think, almost always find that one form predominates greatly over the others. For example in Robert Greene's Euphues his Censure to Philautus, printed by John Wolfe in 1587, we find `frind,' `frindship' and `frindly' used almost exclusively throughout, these spellings being at least ten times as frequent as the `ie' form, while so far as I have observed the word does not occur at all with double `e.' On the other hand in the same author's Mirror of Modesty, 1584, the spelling of this group of words appears to be invariably with double `e,' while in the majority of his other works, including the two parts of Morando printed by Wolfe in the same year as the Censure to Philautus, the spelling `friend' is the usual one. Here then I think we can confidently say that we have a definite variation in spelling which has nothing to do with the length of the line and is not a mere mechanical device of the printer. It remains to see whether we can discover who was responsible for these varied spellings, the authors or the printers. Now evidently if we could find even a few MSS. of different dates which had actually been used as copy for the printers, we should only have to compare them with the printed texts to settle the matter at once; but unfortunately such MSS. are very few indeed. Up to 1600 I only know of a single one, that of part of Harington's translation of the Orlando —I shall have to refer to this later—and even after 1600 there are far too few to found a general rule upon. An alternative method of settling the question would be by comparing the spelling of autograph MSS. letters or other documents, with the spelling of the same man's printed works, but here again we are met by difficulties, though in one case the method has been used with good results. The total amount of known autograph MS. in the hands of writers earlier than the 18th. century is very small—of the hands of some we have no example whatever and there are many others of whom we only have fragments which throw little light on their ordinary spelling—either mere signatures or notes which are too hasty or too formal to give us much information. And even if, as in a few cases, we can form an idea of an author's own spelling, there is the further difficulty that, as we have already seen, the copy which was used by the printer may not have been in his own hand and that if it was a transcript it is likely to have been entirely re-spelt by the transcriber. Let us begin our enquiry by considering what evidence on the point we can derive from the one Elizabethan MS. which is known to have been actually used as copy for the printer, and which consists of a portion of Sir John Harington's translation of the Orlando Furioso printed by Richard Field in 1591. With luck this MS. might have given us a great deal of information, but unfortunately Harington's spelling is far from remarkable. It is in fact, save for a few small points to which I will refer later, merely a good commonplace spelling such as we meet with in many printed books of the time, and the printed text therefore throws little light on how a compositor would treat any spellings which were out of the ordinary. There is, I may say, no doubt that the MS. is in Harington's own hand and there is abundant evidence in the directions to the printer which it contains, and the printer's own marks on it, that it was actually used in the printing-house. A full account of it, with a transcript of certain parts was printed some years ago by Dr. Greg in the Library. A comparison of the printed text with the MS. shows clearly that the compositor troubled himself very little about Harington's spelling, although Harington seems on the whole to have been a more careful and consistent speller than he himself was. Harington, for example, makes much use of `w,' spelling `chawnge' for `change,' `stowng' for `stung' and so on. The printer changes all these `w's to `u's, spelling `chaunge' etc. Harington spells `slander' `slawnder.' The printer alters this once to `slaunder' and once to `sclander.' He changes `soch' to `such' and replaces the `y' for which Harington seems to have had an especial fondness by `i' in such words as `deuisd' `reuild' and so on. Yet at the same time, I think that if we examine the texts carefully side by side, we shall see that here and there the printer was—no doubt unconsciously—influenced by the copy. There are, for example, rather more `y's than are quite usual; thus in the first twenty-four lines printed by Dr. Greg, we have `mynds,' `wynd,' `mynd,' `kynd,' `fayn,' `byte,' `playn,' `kynd,' all spelt with `y,' though certain similar words such as `vile,' `time' and `birth' which Harington equally spelt wth `y,' have been altered. The Harington manuscript does not afford sufficient evidence to enable us to solve our problem in any direct manner, but it does not follow that it is insoluble. There are, as I have suggested, other ways in which we may attempt a solution. For example, there are a few authors with whose spelling habits we are familiar from autograph manuscripts of theirs which have survived, although it does not happen that these surviving manuscripts include any of their printed works. Assuming, as we certainly may, that they followed the same habits of spelling in the MSS. of those works which were printed, we may see whether we can trace these spellings surviving in their printed books. The work of the voluminous pamphleteer Anthony Munday has recently been studied from this point of view by Miss Byrne, with results which, so far as they go, are of considerable interest and importance. We have in Munday's undoubted handwriting two plays, John a Kent and the greater part of Sir Thomas More, and also an autograph dedication to The Heaven of the Mind. The dates of these range from 1586 or a little later to 1602, and they show that although Munday's spelling cannot be regarded as seriously abnormal as a whole, he made regular and consistent use of a few somewhat unusual forms such as a doubled `o' in such words as `doone,' `dooth,' `loove,' `woorthie,' and a doubled `e' in such a word as `freend.' Such spellings are of course by no means rare—we shall indeed later meet with them in the work of other writers—but we can, I think, say that after about 1580 they were seldom used as regularly and consistently as Munday used them, and that his spelling is, therefore, to a certain extent distinctive. Now, Munday was a prolific author who evidently wrote with the view of selling his work at once to the booksellers, and he wrote, as we know, quite a good and legible hand. It seems therefore probable that most of his work would come to the printers in his own autograph. What trace of his peculiarities do we find in his printed books? Miss Byrne has carefully examined a large number of his works from this point of view and has found them divisible—mainly on the evidence of the double `o' spellings—into three classes; those printed between 1580 and 1590; those between 1590 and 1600, and those after 1600. In the first of these groups, especially in A Brief Aunswer made vnto two Seditious Pamphlets, 1580, and A Courtlie Controuersie betweene Loue and Learning, 1581, she finds the double `o' kept almost everywhere. In the second group, those from 1590 to 1600, she finds the double `o' spellings—though not retained consistently—still much above the average for work of the time. In the third group, those after 1600, she finds the spelling regularly normalized with only a few stray double `o's here and there retained apparently by accident. It so happens that several of Munday's books printed between 1580 and 1590, that is those belonging to the first group, in which his double `o's were normally retained, came from the press of John Charlewood. It becomes, therefore, a point of interest to ascertain whether the spelling in question was not a peculiarity of this press rather than of Munday himself. Miss Byrne accordingly investigated all she could find of books of other authors printed by Charlewood during this period, and has been able to show definitely that the double `o's were not due to his compositors, for in no Charlewood book other than Munday's do they occur in anything like the same proportion, though, as in most printing of the time, they do occur occasionally. So far as Munday is concerned, it seems therefore clear that to some extent, and to an extent which varies greatly according to the date of the work, his peculiar spellings did certainly get carried over into the printed editions of his works. There are at least two other Elizabethan writers whose spelling, as shown by their autograph manuscripts, was very distinctive, and who therefore lend themselves to investigation of the same kind, namely, Thomas Churchyard, that most persistent poetaster of the period, who lived until over eighty years of age and long ere that had, according to Spenser, “sung so long until quite hoarse he grew;” and Gabriel Harvey, best known as the enemy of Greene and Nashe. What happened when manuscripts by these men came to the printer? Churchyard's spellings have been investigated in a careful article also by Miss Byrne in The Library for December 1924. I need not trouble you with them beyond saying that their chief peculiarity is an extraordinary use of `ae,' `ie,' `oe,' `ue,' and certain other digraphs, thus `path' is spelt `paeth', `like' `liek', `home' `hoem', `sure' `suer', and so on. That such spellings represented his normal practice is quite clear from autograph letters of his in which they are regularly and consistently used. Now in one poem printed by Bollifant in 1599, Churchyard's Fortunate Farewell to the Earl of Essex, we find Churchyard's spelling kept throughout, or nearly so—evidently as an intentional oddity, possibly at the author's express desire—and in one other book printed in 1575, when the printing-house spelling was much less settled than in 1599, namely the First Part of Churchyard's Chippes, a collection of poems, the peculiar spelling is kept in some pieces—even sometimes in part of a poem —and elsewhere is made normal. In the great majority of his books, the printer seems to have ignored it altogether, though here and there a lapse occurs. It is interesting to note that when a poem in the peculiar spelling was reprinted at a later date, it tended with each reprint to lose more and more of the abnormal forms. This is very clearly shown in the three editions of the Chips dated respectively 1575, 1578 and 1593, the spelling of the last of which is normal throughout. Thus again, in spite of the one poem of 1599 in which Churchyard's spellings were carefully retained, we see that there was a strong tendency on the part of compositors to respell according to their own fancy, though obviously this tendency was stronger in some men than in others and though when an author's spelling was really remarkable, traces of it might be expected to appear from time to time in his printed works. The second person whom I mentioned just now, Gabriel Harvey, was chiefly remarkable for his great fondness for writing the letter `i,' where `e' was usual, in the past tense of verbs, `usid,' `willid,' `callid,' and so on, and instead of a final `y' in such words as `mi,' `mani,' `ani,' `properti,' `iurni,' and the like. He also dropped the `g' in `niht,' `miht,' `brouht,' `enouh' etc. and the final `e' after `g' in such words as `Colleg' and `Cambridg.' On the other hand he nearly always doubled the final consonant of such words as `hot' which he spelt `hott,' `wott,' `poett,' `fitt,' `worshipp,' etc. Now in the autumn of 1592 Harvey seems to have been actually resident in the house of John Wolfe, while the latter was printing his Four Letters against Robert Greene. If, therefore, an author ever had a chance of getting his own system of spelling observed in his book, Harvey had it then. But what do we find? Not a trace of any spelling which would be regarded as seriously abnormal. At most we find a rather more frequent doubling of final consonants than was quite usual in such words as `pitt,' `ciuill,' `verball,' etc. but such spellings are, after all, far from uncommon. Of such peculiarities as -id for -ed or the omission of `g' before `h,' I have been unable to find a single example. * But can we infer nothing as to how closely a compositor followed an author's spelling in those very numerous cases in which we have no manuscript of the author from which to ascertain how he spelt? I think we can at least make an attempt, though the process is necessarily less direct, and the results are perhaps more conjectural. Suppose that we were to find that certain spellings were frequent in the works of a certain author printed by different printers, and that the same spellings did not occur with equal frequency in the works of other authors printed by these same printers, we could evidently infer either that the spellings in question were the author's own, or—a possibility which we must not ignore—that the author was in the habit of having his works transcribed for the press by a particular scribe. Now anything like an extended enquiry on these lines would be very laborious, and I cannot pretend to have undertaken it, but for the sake of experiment I have—in, I fear, rather a casual and unsystematic way—looked through some fourteen of the prose works of Robert Greene in order to see what, if anything, could be deduced from them as to the matter under consideration. Obviously, unless one has an almost infinite amount of leisure at one's disposal, one cannot take all the words used by an author such as Greene, and see how each of them is spelt in each of his numerous works: the only practicable way of working is to take a certain number of words which are in themselves fairly common and which experience shows to have a tendency to vary in spelling, and to limit one's attention to these. We may safely ignore all words which are not likely to occur often enough to give us a useful basis of comparison, and at the same time, for reasons already given, we may ignore all minor variants such as mute `e' inserted or omitted, double or single `l,' `y' or `ie' and so on, which are merely mechanical devices used by the printer for the justification of his lines. Now among the most useful test-words, for such an examination as I had in view, seem to be the following: 1. The word `friend,' the four spellings of which I have already mentioned. 2. The word `beauty,' which is conveniently frequent in Greene's work, and which is often found with a `w' instead of `u'—`beawty.' With this, of course, go such words as `beautiful,' `beautify,' and we shall probably find that a text which uses a `w' in `beauty' uses it also in such words as `flourish,' `fraud,' `laudable,' `plausible' and so on. 3. The word `her' in some texts is spelt `hir,' and the same texts tend to use `i' for `e' in `together,' and a few other words. 4. Words ending in -ire may also be spelt with -ier; `fire' or `fier', `desire' or `desier,' `fair (faire)' or `faier.' 5. The group of words already mentioned in connection with Munday which may be spelt either with a single or a double `o', such as `worth,' `worthy,' `sword,' `move' etc. 6. There is a peculiar spelling of the present participle or gerund of verbs which, in the infinitive, end in `y'. Thus, instead of writing `obeying,' `saying,' `lying,' `carrying' etc. with `yi' as we do now, it was not unusual to write `ie,' thus `obeieng' (or `obaieng'), `saieng,' `lieng' `carrieng'—making the termination `-eng' instead of `-ing.' These spellings look at first sight very odd, but they are fairly common, and a text which uses them at all seems to have some tendency to use them consistently. Now what I naturally hoped and expected to find in my little investigation of Greene's spellings was either that the majority of his books showed a tendency to the same spellings, which, as they are the work of several different printing-houses would presumably show that these spellings were the author's, and incidentally that the compositors—and copyists when copied manuscripts were used—retained at least some of the author's spellings; or alternatively, I expected to find that the books issuing from one printing-house showed a certain uniformity among themselves, which would have shown that they had been respelt by the compositors. As a matter of fact, I found neither of these things. Indeed so far as I can see, the only thing which results from the enquiry is that, on the whole, the spelling of any one book is fairly uniform throughout. I do not propose to analyze my results in detail. This is not the occasion for such an analysis, nor can I pretend that my investigation has been sufficiently thorough to warrant anything of the kind, but the following points may be worth mention. The most remarkable of Greene's works from the point of view of spelling is Euphues his Censure to Philautus printed by John Wolfe in 1587. I have already mentioned that this uses `frind' with an `i,' but it has many other comparatively unusual forms, such as `beawty' with `w,' `fier' for `fire', while it also has a strong tendency to double `o' in `swoord,' `woord' and the like. Both `i' and `e' are used in `her' but the former is much more common. Now while `beauty' with a `w,' and the double `o' occur occasionally in Greene's other works, `frind' with an `i,' is, so far as I have noticed, confined to this book. This, at least, therefore, can hardly be a trace of Greene's own spelling. It so happens that there are two other books of Greene printed by the same printer, John Wolfe, in the same year 1587, namely the two parts of Morando or the Tritameron of Love. Naturally I turned at once to these, expecting to find the same spellings there; but there is not a trace of them. They spell `beauty' with `u,' `friend' as we spell it now, `fire,' `desire' etc. with -re, not -er; `her' with `e,' and so on. In fact the spelling of both these books is, for their date, distinctly `modern' and normal. The same is the case with another book, not by Greene, printed by Wolfe at about the same time, namely the translation of Castilio's Cortegiano. Further, one other book of Greene's printed by Wolfe in the following year, 1588, namely Perimedes the Blacksmith, resembles those which I have just mentioned in most of its spellings but differs in generally using “i” instead of `e' in the word `her'. It seems therefore that we can say definitely that the peculiar spellings which occur in Euphues his Censure are not due to the custom of Wolfe's printing- house. When we turn to Greene's other books we find a similar absence of any sort of regularity in spellings. In one book, namely the Mirror of Modesty, printed by Roger Ward in 1584, we find the word `friend' regularly spelt with two `e's—`freend,' but in the Spanish Masquerado, printed by the same printer five years later, the form with `ie' is used throughout. We may notice in general that the spelling of this second book is very much more modern than that of the Mirror, which contains several unusual forms. In the Mirror, 1584, in Arbasto printed in the same year by another printer, Henry Jackson, in Perimedes printed by Wolfe in 1588, and in Ciceronis Amor, printed by Robinson in 1589, we find `her' always, or, at least, generally, spelt `hir;' in othe other books always or nearly always `her.' Thus, save in so far as some of Greene's later books, those printed in 1588-90, show an absence of any spellings that strike us as archaic or in any way remarkable—a thing which in view of the general tendency of printers' spelling at the date is natural enough—there is, so far as I can see, nothing whatever to suggest that either Greene himself or the customs of the different printing-houses from which his books came determined the peculiar spellings which we find in many of them. And yet since their spelling is not haphazard, since in fact each of the books is very fairly consistent in spelling within itself, there must be some determining factor. We seem to be reduced to two possible explanations, either that Greene's MSS. or many of them, were transcribed by different copyists, each of whom spelt the work according to his own fancy, a thing which is quite possible as we know that Greene's hand was none of the best, or, alternatively, that the spelling in each case is that of the particular compositor who set it up. Perhaps the latter is the true explanation. Nowadays, of course, even quite a small book is generally set up by more than one compositor, but sixteenth century methods were different. The matter was not first set up in long columns and divided afterwards into pages as is done now, but each page was divided off as the compositor went along. As it was impossible without elaborate calculations, which would in any case almost invariably work out wrong, to say in advance where in the copy the end of a page would fall, it was not in ordinary circumstances advisable to employ two men to work simultaneously at different parts of a MS. Sometimes no doubt two compositors would work alternately, one composing while the other distributed matter which had already been printed, but when there was no great haste there would have been no particular gain in this, and I expect that most frequently a single compositor saw the job through. There is therefore no fundamental objection on this score against the spelling of a printed book having been as a rule that of the compositor who set it up. To prove that it was so, we should have to find a number of books from one printing-house spelt in the same way—not of course all his output, as he might employ several compositors, but a reasonable proportion of the whole. So far, I have failed to find this, but there are several considerations which make the search not altogether an easy one. The evidence that I have been able to put before you is far from being as consistent and conclusive as might be desired, but I think that taking together all that is afforded by the work of Harington, Munday, Churchyard, Harvey and Greene, we may fairly say that up to about 1590 a certain number of compositors were strongly influenced by the text before them, especially if it was clear that the spelling of the author was systematic and careful, and might even follow such spelling consistently, but that even then many re-spelt what they were setting up according to their own ideas. After 1590 normalization became quite definitely the general rule. Even after that date it might of course often happen that a compositor—especially perhaps one of the older men—in cases where he regarded two spellings as equally correct might tend to follow that of the MS. before him; and occasionally, as in the 1599 book by Churchyard which I have mentioned, a manuscript spelt in a really remarkable manner might be reproduced exactly, but such things would be rare. It would at any rate, after 1590—perhaps after 1580—be quite unsafe to take the spelling of any ordinary printed book as representing that of its author, or to deduce from the spellings of any anonymous printed work anything as to the identity of its author, or even as to his age, education, or the part of the country from which he came. I suggested in my last lecture that the closeness with which a copyist followed his copy in details might depend a good deal on the nature of the MS. We can probably make the same inferences with regard to the compositor. The less closely a compositor's attention is drawn to the spelling of the MS. before him, the more likely is it that he will normal- ize perfectly. That is to say that, other things being equal, a text set up from a plain and legible MS. will be less likely to contain any abnormal spellings taken over from the MS. than one set up from a difficult MS. over which the compositor has to puzzle, for the extra attention which he has to give the latter is more likely to fix particular spellings in his mind and to cause him to reproduce them. † Similarly we may expect common words with which the compositor is very familiar to be normalized more regularly than those less well known to him, and the spelling of which before his eyes is therefore more likely to influence him. In words which he does not understand or cannot make out— and only in these—are we likely to get an exact reproduction of what he saw, or thought he saw, in the MS. It would be interesting if we could find any similar evidence as to the more or less close following of the punctuation of a MS. at different dates, but I doubt if this would be possible. The study of early punctuation is in its infancy and we cannot say at all definitely whether the average sixteenth century writer had any clear ideas on the matter at all. While of course it would be absurd to declare that the punctuation of printed books of the Shakespearian period is quite haphazard, it would be equally absurd to claim that it is in the majority of cases strictly logical. With MSS. the case is, as we should expect, rather worse. No doubt, writers intended to place a full point at the end of every sentence, but they often forgot to do this, while within the sentence the punctuation seems often to consist of no more than occasional commas used perhaps as much to mark the breath-pauses, though less consistently than in earlier times, as to indicate the logical relationship of parts of the sentence. Certainly in printing Harington's Orlando Furioso the printer paid little or no attention to the punctuation of the MS. On the other hand as has been pointed out by Mrs. Percy Simpson, there is abundant evidence that John Donne punctuated carefully, and his punctuation was in general carefully followed both by copyists and by printers. Donne, however, was of course a scholar, and it is quite likely that he would use exceptional care in a matter of this kind. At the same time it may fairly be argued from the example of his work that when copyists and printers found that a MS. before them was systematically punctuated they were quite ready to let the punctuation alone. So much for actual composition, but there were of course other persons beside the compositor who were concerned in the correctness of a text. At all times proofs must have been taken and these must have been read either by someone in the office or by the author and the type corrected in accordance, or more or less in accordance, with their directions. It is well known that, certainly during the Elizabethan period, and probably from the earliest days of printing until late in the eighteenth century the author of a book often attended in person at the printing-house in order to read proofs. There is abundant evidence of the usualness of the practice in the numerous notes affixed to errata and elsewhere apologizing for errors on the ground of the author's inability for some reason or other to attend to his duty. Now we may assume that, as a general rule, an author would know what he meant to say and that, provided that the corrections marked by him on the proof were properly carried out by the compositor, serious errors would not be left in the print—though it is surprising what serious errors an author can overlook in his own work—errors which, as a rule, he would detect at once in the work of others. But at the same time there must have been many books the proofs of which were not read by their authors. Thus we may, I think, assume that as a rule reprints would not be so read—in many cases the author was himself dead, and it is only very occasionally that we can find evidence of editorial supervision of any kind. Presumably the same thing would apply to all such manuscripts as were published by booksellers into whose possession they had come without their author's knowledge or consent, as well as to all plays sold to the booksellers by theatrical companies. Nevertheless for all these books proof-reading of a sort would be needed, and it would be interesting to know how and by whom it was done. As I have already mentioned, there seems in England to have been nothing at all corresponding to the Continental custom of employing scholars in an editorial capacity at the chief printing-presses. Indeed, there is, so far as I am aware, neither in the records of the Stationers Company nor elsewhere any evidence of the employment of a single person in connection with the printing-houses other than that of the King's Printer in what we may call a literary capacity,—i.e. other than as an actual printer, compositor, type-caster or binder. And yet it seems improbable that the compositors or press-men should have carried out this task themselves—can we assume that the master-printer read and corrected all the proofs himself? This is, perhaps, less impossible than might be supposed, for the output of even the largest houses was small, but it certainly suggests rather a higher level of general education in the master-printers than one would have expected—even if special readers were sometimes found for special classes of work. At the same time it does perhaps suggest a contributory reason for the badness of the texts of many plays, which were probably regarded as a low class of work unworthy of serious attention. It is difficult to believe that a proof-reading employee whose duty it would be to see that all work which passed through his hands was correctly printed, would have allowed such nonsense to pass as is often found in these texts. It is much easier to suppose this to be due to correction being really the master's job and to his thinking—the MS. being in all probability itself a bad one—that the work was not worth troubling much about. Here, again, there is a little point which seems worth investigating—at least for those who are keen to obtain every scrap of knowledge which may contribute to textual criticism—namely whether the standard of accuracy differed, as a general thing, in different printing-houses; or whether in all we find some books correct and others incorrect. I imagine that we might be able to say of a certain dramatic quarto that this was printed at a house where the work was generally very correct, and that therefore we must be very careful in rejecting what we find in it; and of another that the reader of the press from which it came was apparently only on the watch for literals, and, provided that a word was spelt correctly, seems to have cared little whether it made sense or not, and therefore that in emending this text we might use much greater freedom. This is a point to which I believe that little attention has yet been paid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* It should, however, be mentioned that Professor Dover Wilson, who, in his contribution to Shakespeare's Hand in “Sir Thomas More”, dealt in some detail with this question of whether Harvey's peculiar spellings were traceable in his printed works, has in other books of Harvey found a very few instances of these spellings being preserved. For example he has found eight examples of -id, -ist, -ith, for -ed, -est, -eth, the `i' for `e' which is perhaps Harvey's most remarkable peculiarity, but as in order to find these he had to examine more than 200 pages of text, such a small number of obviously accidental occurrences only reinforces the general conclusion that the compositor had no intention whatever of reproducing Harvey's idiosyncrasies in this matter. † It may be worth while to point out that if this is true, and if we are right in supposing that the manuscripts from which some of the Shakespearian quartos were printed were exceptionally bad ones—from the compositor's point of view—there is a greater likelihood of finding traces in them of Shakespeare's own spelling than would be the case with the spellings of those authors whose works were printed from manuscripts more carefully prepared for the press. The point is of some importance in view of the discussion as to whether the famous “three pages” of the play of Sir Thomas More are or are not in Shakespeare's autograph. As I need hardly remind you, one of the arguments by which it has been sought to prove that they are, is that certain spellings found in the Shakespeare quartos suggest that the spellings of the MSS. from which they were printed were similar to those found in these three pages of More.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Having now obtained some idea of the process of transmission from manuscript to print, and of the closeness with which the printed book of the sixteenth century may be expected to correspond with the author's manuscript, let us consider how the transmission actually worked—to what extent it succeeded or failed. It is clear that all or almost all the older editors of our sixteenth and seventeenth century literature had a very low opinion of the original printers. Whenever they could not understand a thing, they assumed a misprint and tried to amend it, and that this habit of emendation was not confined to the less scholarly is evident from the well-known instances of Bentley's edition of Paradise Lost, a book which has become a byword for unnecessary and absurd tampering with the text. That the idea of the unreliability of Elizabethan and Jacobean printers is still prevalent may be seen in the occasional pronouncements of very competent scholars, who when they find any early work printed with care and accuracy seem to have a curious tendency to regard it as exceptional. The fact is of course that we have all happened to direct our chief attention to that part of the output of the Elizabethan press which is the least correctly printed, namely the drama. I have already suggested what, in my opinion, may be one reason for this strange badness of the dramatic texts, and need say no more about it now. Even the dramatic texts are indeed hardly so bad as a hasty glance at the vast array of variant readings and conjectural emendations which encumber some modern editions would lead one to suppose. The number of proposed emendations in the text of Shakespeare and his contemporaries which increased knowledge of their time and language have shown to be unnecessary, are certainly hundreds and perhaps thousands; but there still remain a very large number of errors in the early prints, and it is natural enough that those whose acquaintance with the printing of the Elizabethan period is mainly derived from the study of such texts should regard its standard as exceedingly low. I frankly admit that I have held the same opinion myself, though I do so no longer. If however we omit for the moment from our consideration the whole body of dramatic literature, I believe that we shall come to a very different conclusion as to the general level of Elizabethan printing. Indeed if we allow for the less degree of legibility of black letter and for the comparative inferiority of much of the roman type owing either to bad casting or to wear, which must often have made letters difficult to distinguish from one another in proof, I do not think that we shall find the better-class printing of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries very much below the standard of accuracy of the nineteenth. One has only to take any of the more serious books of the time, works of history, of divinity, of science, or even those large translations from the classics such as North's Plutarch, or Holland's Pliny, and read a few pages carefully, as one would read a proof for press, to see that, inferior as they may be in their press work to what we are accustomed to nowadays—and even in press work some of them are not so bad—on the score of textual accuracy there is very little to complain of. Let us consider a few non- dramatic books of our period from this point of view. To begin with one of the largest books of the first half of the sixteenth century, the edition of Malory's Morte d'Arthur printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1529, a book which I choose because we have a definite statement concerning the printing of it by one who collated the whole text. This was done by Dr. Oskar Sommer in the course of his work on the Caxton edition. He has listed the whole of Wynkyn de Worde's departures from Caxton's text, amounting to nearly 10,000 in number, and remarks that these were obviously introduced with the intention of modernizing the text, and of rendering it more readable. Though, however, as he says, Caxton's text was occasionally misunderstood and wrongly rendered, he “can hardly call to mind a misprint.” Actually, there were of course a few. Sommer's own collations show the omission of five whole lines in different parts of the book, all presumably accidental, but as the Morte d'Arthur contains not far short of 400,000 words, this is certainly not a high proportion of errors. On the whole, considering that this is a romance, and not any sort of work of divinity or statecraft or science to the correctness of which we might expect special attention to be paid, and that it cannot have been read in proof by its author or anyone to whom its accuracy was a matter of great personal importance, considering, in short, that it was apparently an ordinary trade reprint, it is surely by no means a discreditable production. The Morte d'Arthur is a large folio. As a contrast let us next take the three small octavo volumes by Thomas Lupset, scholar and divine, of which the original editions were printed by Thomas Berthelet in 1533, 1534 and 1535, and which, I think, are fairly representative of the better-class printing of their time. Lupset died in 1530, so here again there is no question of any personal supervision of the printing by the author. The recent careful edition of Lupset by Dr. J. A. Gee of Yale makes it easy for us to examine the correctness of these texts and I think that whoever does so will admit that there is very little to complain of. The editor has, it is true, found it necessary to depart from the original punctuation in a number of places, but in many of these it is, I think, rather a matter of loose sentence construction than of actual misprints. In the Exhortation to young men of 1535 which the editor describes as “the most carelessly printed of all the first editions of Lupset's works” there appear to be about 19 errors in 80 pages, and it must be admitted that these are very small pages consisting of only about 130 words each. But of the 19 errors it cannot be said that there is one which causes any serious disturbance of the text. We find `this' for `thus,' `he' for `the,' `his' for `this,' `my' for `mo' (i.e. more), and `this' for `these', practically all correctable at first sight. The others are, I think, all errors of a single letter, or of the accidental dropping out of a letter or two, `ensampe' for `ensample,' `phylosothers' for `phylosophers' (`t' for `p') and so on. And this is the least correct of Lupset's three books. In the best of the three the most serious mistakes are no more than an `and' repeated, the word `god' once omitted in a passage where it occurs several times, and an `h' misprinted for a `b' in `neighbour,' an error which would be very easily overlooked in a black letter proof. It would perhaps hardly be fair to take the large folio volume of the English Works of Sir Thomas More printed in 1557 as one of our examples, for since the time of Dr. Johnson, the volume seems to have enjoyed a reputation for especially accurate printing. Examination certainly shows it to be indeed a very careful piece of work, with few errors and those, as a rule, of little importance. When we come to the Elizabethan work, we find, I think, in the output of all the more important presses, very much the same state of affairs. There is, for example, very little wrong with the text of such books as the 1587 edition of Holinshed's Chronicles or Holland's translation of Plutarch's Morals, to mention two which I happen to have used a good deal at different times; but I need not linger over these. Let us take, as an example, of a different class of work, Spenser's Faery Queene. In the one-volume Oxford edition of Spenser the text of the Faery Queene is based on the 1596 edition printed by Richard Field, one of the better, though by no means the best, of the Elizabethan printers, in which edition books IV to VI appear for the first time. If we examine book IV, the first of these new books, we shall find that the editor has thought it necessary to depart from the text as printed only in 21 places. Now of the 21 errors three at least, and probably four, must, I think, be misreadings of the original MS.—whether by a copyist or by the compositor we of course cannot say—`bravelike' for `beamlike,' `nearest' for `meanest,' `guest' for `quest' and `virtues' for `virtuous.' One, namely `three' for `seven' is probably a slip on the part of the author or copyist, as may be a `her' for `his.' Of the others, 11 consist of a single letter wrong, omitted or superfluous, such as `worst' for `worse,' `said' for `sad,' `repayred' for `repayed.' In passing we may note that, with a single exception, all these errors form real words, or in the case of the four proper names included among them, what may seem to be real words, a fact which indicates, I think, careful but not very intelligent proof-reading, and suggests a doubt whether Spenser read the proofs himself, although as he was apparently in England at the time he may have done so. Now these 21 errors are perhaps not quite all. In some half-a-dozen cases besides these, emendations have been proposed and some of them may be correct, but the text as it stands is nowhere else so evidently corrupt that the Oxford editor felt compelled to emend it. Further, there may be a few errors of punctuation and possibly some other trifling mistakes which the editor has not thought it worth while to notice, indeed three or four such minor errors are noted by Grosart, but even if we allow that there may be in all some 30 or 35 errors, we still have the remark- able fact that, in the whole of this book consisting of 5391 lines of verse, there are not more than two passages which contain such serious faults that an editor who had before him no other text than this first edition of 1596 need have had any real doubt as to the correct reading; and even in these two he might have guessed without any very great risk of error. And this, as I have said, is in a text of 5391 lines, whereas, I need hardly remind you, the average length of Shakespeare's plays is only some 2,800 lines—little more than half as much, the longest, Hamlet, having under 4,000. Lastly, for the purpose of comparison with the First Folio of Shakespeare, it seemed well to look at some book from the same printing-house, and not far off in date. I therefore took the second volume of the prose compilation entitled The Treasurie of Anncient and Moderne Times which was printed by William Jaggard in 1619, and as an experiment read ten pages with as much care as I am capable of, noting down every misprint, however trivial, that I found. The book is a large folio and 10 pages contain some 7500 words. In the pages chosen I noted 18 errors of which only one is at all serious. The others consist of such trivial errors as the omission of commas in series of names, so that Suidas Strabo appears to be a single person, of single erroneous letters in Latin names so that we have `Titesias' for `Tiresias' and `Nenius' for `Neuius,' an `n' for `u' in `seuenth,' and the apparent mistaking of the English word `seaside' for a Latin place name `Seasia.' Considering the large number of classical and foreign names in the book, we have I think little cause for complaint here. There is another and perhaps easier way in which we can estimate the accuracy of some at least of these early books, namely by examination of the lists of errata which many of them contain. When, as sometimes happens, such lists are long, we often find that an excuse is given. I am not thinking of those lists of errata compiled by an author which, as so many do, excuse the mistakes on the ground of his absence for some cause or another from the printing house, and inability to supervise the work as it went through the press, for such errata-lists often include corrections which are evidently afterthoughts on the part of the author, but of those lists which seem to include only actual departures from the MS. due to the fault of the printer. Some of these lists are quite worth looking at. There is, for example, one in John Whitgift's Defence of the Answer to the Admonition, as it is called, the official reply on behalf of the Bishops to the puritan Cartwright's Reply to the Answere against the Admonition to the Parliament. This, which was printed by Bynneman in 1574 is a folio of 812 pages. As an official work and one likely to be subjected to the minute scrutiny of the Bishops' opponents it would no doubt be printed with especial care, but we know that the work was put through as rapidly as possible. The printer apologizes for the errors in it on the ground that `it could not be but that in so great a volume some things should escape even those that are diligent and carefull, especially considering the speedie dispatch and other circumstances.' But yet the whole list of corrections for this volume of 812 pages only amounts to 33. The most serious is the omission of a whole line at the beginning of a page, the compositor having evidently missed his place. The others are mostly verbal, i.e. real words but the wrong ones, and, save for one or two which are due to the dropping of a letter—such as `paynly' for `playnly' and `eternal' for `external'—seem mostly due to misreading of the copy. Thus we have the common mistake of `any' for `my,' `more' for `move' and `service' for `sorowe,' the last two of which are in a secretary hand, not so different as one might suppose. There are probably a few other literal errors not thought worth pointing out, as they did not form words and could not therefore lead to any misunderstanding, but I have looked through a good many pages without finding any. But I need not weary you with further discussion of particular books. What I have already said will, I hope, be enough to convince you that we cannot lump together all the work of all the early printing houses in one condemnation. We must distinguish, and I think, though I cannot go into the matter now, that investigation would show a very considerable difference of standard between the larger printing-houses, such as those of Day and Bynneman, which did their own publishing, and the smaller, so-called trade printers, who seldom if ever published books themselves but worked for the smaller publishers or book-sellers. It was these smaller publishing-houses which handled most of the popular literature such as pamphlets and plays and it was consequently the trade printers by whom they were produced. But even these trade printers, even those from whose presses came some of the worst play quartos, were capable of turning out far better work in other classes of literature. It will have been gathered that in my view too great a share of the blame for the errors which we find in certain sixteenth and seventeenth century books has been laid on the printers and that in most cases when we get a really bad text the fault lies mainly in the copy supplied to the compositor and not in the carelessness or want of skill of the latter. Nevertheless there were then, as there are now, errors in printed books and it is part of the duty of the textual critic to make such study of these errors and their causes as may enable him to form some idea of how they may have occurred and thus place him in a better position to defend his own emendations of them. I propose therefore now to say something as to the common causes of errors in printed books—such errors I mean as are due to departure from the MS. before the compositor, for of antecedent errors due to mistakes in copying and the like I can add nothing to what I have said already. The obvious groups into which we can divide errors on the basis of their causation are as follows: (1) Misreading of copy. (2) Foul case, i.e. the presence of wrong type in the various divisions of the type- case. (3) Failure of muscular co-ordination or of memory on the part of the compositor. (4) Mis-correction. At the present time, and especially with modern mechanical methods of type-setting, the commonest cause of misprints is, I suppose, misreading of the MS., at any rate in the case of books set up from a handwritten copy. The number of these which will appear in the proof sent to the author of a modern book depends of course mainly on the legibility of his writing, but it will also depend to a great extent on the intelligence of the printer's reader. It is, by the way, curious how insensitive readers at even the best presses become on the question of meaning or good sense, and what absurdities they will sometimes allow to pass, while at the same time correcting or querying the smallest abnormality in spelling or in grammar. A wrong word however nonsensical in its context, seems to be much more easily overlooked than a wrong spelling—a point of very great importance in textual criticism. As an example of what I mean, I may mention that a few weeks ago I happened to be reading the proofs of an elementary biology. These proofs were almost entirely free—so far as I remember quite free—from errors in spelling or `misprints' of the ordinary kind, but within a few pages I came across the statement that water was `incomprehensible,' where the author had written `incompressible,' and a reference to the habits of mice in `perpetrating' their kind, where the word should of course have been `perpetuating.' Now the author's MS. was by no means bad and the words were perfectly legible. The compositor had, I suppose, not really looked at them and the proof-reader had evidently not been thinking of the sense. But if the compositor instead of setting `incomprehensible' and `perpetrating' had set, say, `incompressable' with `able' instead of 'ible,' and `prepetuating' instead of `perpetuating' I have not the slightest doubt that the errors would have been noticed by the reader and corrected. There is, I think, not much of a general nature that can usefully be said about errors which seem to arise from the misreading of copy, though a good deal of work has been lately directed to the question of what misreadings are most likely to occur in setting up from MSS. written in the current hands of the Elizabethan time. As you are doubtless aware, during the later part of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, the traditional English script was giving place to an Italian script of the kind now used. Manuscripts of a more formal kind—such as those written by professional scribes—between say, 1580 and 1620, are normally in English script with proper names and quotations from foreign languages in the `Italian' hand, this differentiation corresponding to that ordinarily made in printed books by the use of black-letter, roman and italic types. The usage of the average non-professional writer was less fixed. Latin quotations and foreign names were, I think, almost invariably written in Italian script, but the practice as regards English names varied and only the more careful writers seem ordinarily to have written these in Italian. Now it is evident that, in order to judge what misreadings are likely to have been made by a compositor, it is necessary to know whether the particular word before him would be in the English or Italian hand, for the confusions possible in the two are quite different. For example in the English hand confusion is particularly likely between `d' and `e,' `p' and `x,' `r' and `v,' and `o' and `e;' while with Italian the most probable are perhaps `di' and `ch,' `ol' and `d,' `h' and `li.' Both in English and Italian, long `s' may be confused with `f' and it is often difficult to read correctly groups of minims such as `in,' `ui,' and `m,' especially when the `i's are not carefully dotted. It is therefore essential that before we assume a misreading on the part of a compositor we should consider and come to some conclusion on the question of the script in which the particular word is likely to have been written in the copy. It is hardly necessary to say that if we are going to assume errors in reading the MS. they must be errors which could reasonably have arisen, a thing which seems generally to be forgotten by amateur textual critics. Further, the misreadings must be consistent with one another. Unless we have reason to suspect that the writing of the MS. was especially irregular or mixed, we must not assume in one line a misreading which could only arise from an Italian hand—say a misreading of `di' for `ch'—and in the next a misreading of `p' for `x' which could only occur in an English one—unless of course the words are such as would normally be written in different scripts. As I have said, a good deal of recent textual criticism has been concerned with the possibility of misreadings by the compositor. By far the fullest exposition of the view that the great majority of misprints—at any rate in Shakespeare—are due to misreading of his writing, is to be found in the important book by Professor Leon Kellner, published in 1925 under the title of Restoring Shakespeare. Of this it need only be said that it is a most careful and elaborate piece of work, but that it seems to seek to prove far too much. Suppose that we were familiar with an author's handwriting, we might quite well observe in it peculiarities which might cause certain combinations of letters to be confused with certain others—for example, in the hand of a man who was careless about dotting his `i's, `un' and `im' might be quite indistinguishable, and knowing this, we might feel confidence in emending `unparted' to `imparted.' Perhaps I may be excused for mentioning a personal experience of my own which shows that we might sometimes go even further than this. A certain friend of mine used habitually to write the second limb of the capital `K' as an upstroke from the foot of the first, so that the letter looked like a capital `V' with an insignificant tail to it. Coming across in an anonymous review a reference to myself in which my name was printed as McVarrow, I was able at once to guess that this particular friend was the writer of it, as indeed he admitted when asked. We cannot of course expect to be often able to identify an anonymous author by the occurrence of a single misprint, but it is obvious that the study of an author's handwriting—if we can obtain specimens of it—may be of the greatest importance in textual criticism, and indeed there is nothing new in so using it. Even if we do not know an author's hand, but can be reasonably certain that his work, or at any rate that part—it must be a considerable part—of his work which we are studying was printed from his own MS. in the hand of a single copyist, we may from the occurrence of frequent errors which show the same confusion of letters and the emendation of which is obvious—suppose for example we find a proper name, the correct form of which we must have known, frequently misspelt—infer that in his, or the copyist's, hand certain particular letters might easily be confused, and assume the same confusion as possible in emending other errors. In the case, however, of work such as that of Shakespeare, where the history of the MSS. is so various, it is difficult to get much definite result from such studies, for it is quite possible that in some plays one or more copyists have intervened between Shakespeare and the compositor, and errors may be due to peculiarities of their writing and not of the author's. Proof of a misreading by the compositors due to their writing, would be of course no argument that a similar confusion is likely to occur in another play. It is therefore evident that though there are certainly, and have always been, words that can easily be confused in handwriting, as for example `any' and `my'—words which —as everyone who has had to do much proofreading knows—are con- stantly even now getting misprinted for one another, and though we must of course always take account of handwriting in considering an emendation, it does not seem likely that intensive study on the lines laid down by Kellner is likely to be very fruitful. A second sort of error is due to what is called “foul case”—namely the presence of wrong letters in the divisions or `boxes' of the type case. That wrong types would occasionally get into the boxes by careless distribution of previous work or in other ways is obvious, and unless such a type was markedly thicker or thinner than the one intended, a compositor would not notice the error in putting it into the composing stick. An attempt to show that certain particular errors were likely to be due to this cause was made as long ago as 1872 by William Blades in his Shakespeare and Typography, where he pointed out that, seeing that the type-cases stood on a slope, there was, if the type-boxes happened to be at all over-filled, a certain likelihood of letters slipping down from their proper box into the one below; thus `o' might slip down into the `a' box, `b' into the `l' box, `l' into the `v' box, `d' into the `n' box, and so on. This would render such mistakes as `forced' for `farced,' `book' for `look,' `low' for `vow,' particularly likely. This is no doubt true enough, and there may be cases of error due to this cause, but it does not in itself carry us far and a little careless distribution of type from an earlier job would probably lead to many more wrong letters in the boxes than would arise from such a cause as this. A few points we may, however, note. The letters `e,' `c,' and `o,' `b' and `h,' and `u' and `n' are very commonly interchanged in black letter, and `u' and `n' in roman. These confusions are probably due to mistakes in distribution and might easily be overlooked in a rough proof. The very frequent cases of the use of an inverted `u' in place of an `n,' or an inverted `n' for a `u' are more difficult to account for. They may be due to an original error of a `u' set in place of an `n,' or vice versa, which being noticed in proof has been corrected by turning the letter instead of substituting the proper one. The difference in many founts is indeed so slight that in the case of worn type it may be very difficult to say what the letter really is. Occasionally the wrong matrix may have been used in casting. More interesting than these purely mechanical matters are the errors due to failure of muscular co-ordination on the part of a compositor or to failure of his memory. By failure of co-ordination I mean the unconscious failure of the hand to make the movement intended, so that the fingers when moving across the case to pick up a type do not go exactly where they should and one is picked up from the wrong box; just as when in typing one, without knowing it, strikes the wrong key. Errors of this kind of course tend to increase with fatigue or when the attention happens momentarily to be diverted. As is well known to those who have occasion to read many typewritten manuscripts, a large proportion of typists when tired or inattentive tend to interchange neighbouring letters, especially in common words, writing `hwen' for `when,' `hte' for `the,' `won' for `own' and so on, and the same error seems to be frequent in matter set with the modern type-setting machines worked by a key-board of the same kind as that of a typewriter. I had occasion recently to read the proofs of a book of passages from French authors. This was as a whole extremely well set, but it was noticeable that transpositions of the kind that I have mentioned were comparatively frequent. In the course of some 250 pages I counted at least 31 errors which could only be put down to this cause: `plien' for `plein,' `suele' for `seule,' `linge' for `ligne,' `etrre' for `terre,' `sceret' for `secret,' and so on. Such transposition errors were indeed as frequent as all other mistakes put together. Of course the proof that I read was not a first proof, so I cannot say anything as to the number of errors made in the original composition. No normally careful modern printer would fail to correct the majority of such errors in an English text before sending out a proof to his customer; but it might be worth while trying to discover before hand-setting disappears altogether, whether there are any special tendencies of what may be called a psychological character to certain errors or not. For example, it might be—I am only uessing—that when a man is tired the movement of the hand across the case might tend to be shortened, so that his fingers are likely to pick up a type from a division nearer to the centre or possibly lower than he thinks he is doing. If this is so, we should perhaps be able to make out a special tendency to the occurrence of certain misprints; thus we might find the long `s' ligatures substituted for the `f' ligatures (because they come nearer to the centre of the case) more commonly than the reverse error, or `c' might be used for `b' for a similar reason. But here again I doubt if we should get much positive result. On the other hand it does seem not impossible that investigation would show that the frequency of certain combinations of letters might cause them to be substituted by a careless or tired compositor for other less usual ones. It would at any rate be interesting to know whether or not any such tendency is to be detected. It might seem that the kinds of error which I have been discussing—the simple substitution of one letter for another—are of no importance, because before a text is finally printed such obvious errors generally get corrected, or if not put right by the corrector they can be instantly emended by the reader. This is to a certain extent true. If one meets with the word `hte' where the sense obviously required `the' the error is of no importance whatever, one corrects it automatically in reading; possibly indeed one may not even notice it. But in the first place there are many words which by an error of a single letter are transformed into other words (especially was this the case when spelling was not as fixed as it is at present), and sometimes these words will give a kind of sense, so that the error is not noticed by the proof-reader; and secondly an error of a single letter may cause a corrector to correct in a wrong way altogether. Thus, suppose the word `obscured' to be printed `obseured' a corrector careless of the sense may alter it to `obserued' taking the fault to be in the transposition of `u' and `r' instead of in the `e'—or suppose we have the word `trueness' printed in error as `tureness' a corrector may alter it mistakenly to `sureness'—these, by the way, are genuine cases and not imaginary ones. But seeing that in textual work our difficulty is nearly always with words which while being genuine words are the wrong words, rather than with collections of letters which are not words at all, the other sort of compositor's error which I have mentioned, due to failure of memory, is of more importance to us, when instead of unconsciously setting a wrong letter under the impression that it is a right one, he sets an altogether wrong word. It is, and presumably always has been, the practice of a compositor to read several words of his copy at a time and to keep them in his memory while setting them up. If he is not careful, he may very easily substitute a wrong word—especially a word of the same meaning—for what he ought to set, or a false analogy may lead him astray. To give a single instance of this sort of error, there occurs in Nashe's Unfortunate Traveller a reference to a person who had the beginnings of a beard `a sable auglet of excrements in the rising of the anckle of his chinne.' Now `anckle' is of course `angle'; the spelling has no authority and may itself be a mere slip on the part of the compositor, but having set up `ankle' his mind apparently began to run on feet and legs and instead of `chin' he set up `shin,' making the person described have a beard `on the ankle of his shin.' As the mistake was corrected in the errata of the book we know that it was a simple mistake and not any kind of intended jest. The most famous examples of error attributable to the compositor's failures of memory occur, however, in the Faery Queene, where in nine places we find substituted for a rhyming word a metrically equivalent synonym which does not rhyme. Thus we have `chace' where the rhyme requires `prey;' `play' where `sport' is required; `make' (a feast) where rhyme requires `hold,' `vpreare' for `vpheaue,' `times' for `age' and so on. It has, I may say been regarded as questionable whether these readings are really errors or not. Some have regarded them as an intentional freakishness on Spenser's part, perhaps intended in some way to follow the precedent of the incomplete lines of Virgil, but it seems at least equally likely that they are due either to carelessness in copying or, yet more probably, to this failure of memory on the part of the compositor which we are discussing. In several of the cases the phrase printed is slightly more usual than the one required by the rhyme, while in one or two the previous rhyme word may have suggested the word printed, as when `spyde' in place of `saw' is printed immediately after a line ending `sight.' It may be remarked that as Spenser's lines average eight words or more it might be not unreasonable to suppose that there may be seven times as many mistakes in words other than rhyme-words arising in a similar way, and in general we should, I think, expect a certain amount of vitiation of all texts, both MS. and printed, to arise from this kind of substitution of synonyms, which is of course, if the synonym is at all a reasonable one, exceedingly hard to detect. It is not at all unlikely that certain of the apparently pointless alterations which we sometimes find in reprinted texts are due simply to this failure of memory on the part of the compositor and have no significance whatever. Thus of the two editions of Nashe's Unfortunate Traveller, one of which is printed from the other, the first has `the campe or the court, or the court and the camp,' the second `the court or the camp, or the camp and the court,' simply interchanging in each phrase the words `camp' and `court;' one text has `ancenstrie' the other `ancestors;' one has `carelesnes' the other `forgetfulnes;' one has `rashly' the other `hastely' and so on. In such cases it is hardly possible to suppose deliberate correction, for the one phrase seems to be just as good as the other. On the other hand, it is easy to suppose that a careless or hurried compositor having read from his copy the first rather involved phrase would get it wrong way round, or that for the rarer form `ancestrie' he should set `ancestors.' So long as such deviations from the original appeared to make decent sense it is unlikely that a proof-reader would notice them, or if he did notice them would bother to correct them in work in which minute accuracy did not seem to him of especial importance. We now come to what is, I believe, probably the most important cause of seriously bad texts—that sort of text, I mean, which is obviously corrupt, and in such a way as to defy emendation, namely bad correction. I cannot help believing that if we only possessed the first proofs of such things as the Shakespeare quartos, or of the First Folio, with all the mistakes of the original composition in them, we should be able without difficulty to construct a much better text than we now can compass. I believe that many of the worst difficulties in the text are the result of stupid and unintelligent attempts at correction rather than of the illegibility of the copy or the carelessness of the compositor. If one has before one simply a bad but honest attempt to decipher a difficult word, one can usually, or at any rate very often, make a better attempt oneself, or if a word has simply a letter or two wrong or out of place one can usually guess the right word, but when a fool has already been at work on these errors and has corrected them into something much more erroneous, emendation at this second stage is a far more difficult affair. I have drawn attention elsewhere to an example of this sort of erroneous correction which occurs in Nashe's Pierce Penniless but it is so exactly to the point that I must be pardoned for using it again. In three editions, each printed from the one before it, we have in a certain side-note the readings: The confutation of Citizens obiections against Players. The confutation of Citizens against Players. The coniuration of Citizens against Players. Now it is obvious that the first of these is correct. The second made nonsense of the note by omitting the word `obiections' whereupon the compositor or proof-reader of the third, seeing that the note was wrong, but not seeing wherein the error lay, altered rather ingeniously, `confutation' to `coniuration.' Supposing that we had only the second and third of these texts we should, I think, have little difficulty in guessing that some word similar in meaning to `obiections' had dropped out after `Citizens,' but if we had only the third edition, with `confutation' emended to `coniuration', he would be, I think, a critic of real genius who could guess what the original reading had been. I cannot help believing that in unintelligent correction we have the explanation of many of the obscure passages of sixteenth century dramatic literature. The compositor makes an error of some sort—perhaps merely a trivial one—the proof-reader sees something is wrong and not troubling to refer back to the copy makes the words into real words with little or no regard to sense or context, and thus transforms a little and probably easily corrected mistake into one which has defied generations of critics to put right. But it will perhaps be said that the traditional method of proof correction is for a boy to read the manuscript aloud and for the corrector to follow the proof word by word at the same time, and I may be asked how, if this was done, such miscorrection could occur. This method is carefully set forth in Moxon's Mechanic Exercises of 1683, and a reading boy may be seen in the famous—though, I think, somewhat imagina- tive —engraving of a Dutch printing-house by Johannes Stradanus dating from about 1600. It is also described in most of the later treatises on printing. No doubt such a method of proof-reading would be the ideal, and it is quite probable that it was used in good printing-houses when important work was in progress, but I confess that I have great doubts whether it was at any time much employed for the ordinary day by day printing of the smaller printing-houses. Serious errors and especially omissions are practically impossible by this method, for the chances of the compositor and the reading boy both missing the identical words is of course negligible, while even the same misreading is hardly likely to be made by two independent readers. But I cannot believe that any such care as this was taken over ordinary work such as pamphlets or plays. The obvious course was for a corrector to read the proof itself, only referring to the MS. when he found something that he could not correct by the light of nature, and I think that this is what was usually done and that the correction was often merely the most casual guess work, the corrector contenting himself with replacing evidently erroneous words by real words, neglecting the sense, and as I have said, often correcting the words into wrong ones. It is of course impossible as a rule to be certain that an error was due to wrong correction, though many authors have at one time or another complained of incorrect alterations having been made in their work after they had passed the final proofs; indeed such well-meaning but unnecessary tampering with the text is not unknown even at present. I will venture to give you what I think is probably an example, and a somewhat curious one, of miscorrection from the advertisement columns of a London newspaper of some four years ago. It occurs in a series of advertisements of the firm of J. Lyons &amp; Co. the caterers, written by a rather well-known literary man. He had occasion—I need not explain, indeed I do not think I could explain, the connection with his subject—to quote from Swinburne's famous `hounds of spring' chorus in Atalanta, in which occur the lines: `And fruit and leaf are as gold and fire, And the oat is heard above the lyre, And the hoofed heel of the satyr crushes The chestnut-husk at the chestnut-root.' Now that second line—`and the oat is heard above the lyre'—must, I think, have puzzled someone in the printing office. You can imagine him expostulating `But you can't possibly hear oats. There must be something wrong there!' and running over in his head the words for which `oat' might be an error, `mat,' `rat,' `fat,' etc. no doubt rejecting `cat,' though indeed audible, as unlikely in high-class poetry, until at last the word `bat' occurred to him, and he perhaps remembered that the cheep of a bat on summer evenings is not without poetical associations—though indeed Swinburne was not writing about summer evenings—so down it went in the proof and the line appeared— `And the bat is heard above the lyre.' I wonder, by the way, if that advertisement version of Swinburne's lines had alone survived whether any textual critic would ever have guessed the correct reading, and if one did, whether others would have accepted it. There is one frequent fault of correction which is not uncommon even at present and which is especially hard to notice. This is when a word in the proof is rightly marked to be corrected, and the compositor corrects the wrong one. Thus a certain word occurs twice within the space of two or three lines. In one case it is wrong in the other right. The corrector notices the error and duly marks it, but the compositor by inadvertence makes the correction in the wrong place. When the corrections come to be checked, the reader notices that the marked word has not been corrected, and marks it again in the revise, but unless he reads the whole passage through (as one always should do when one finds a correction apparently ignored), he will not notice that the correction has been made elsewhere. The result is that the correction gets made in two places, one of which is wrong. All who have had much to do with proof-reading will have met with instances of this annoying accident in work which they thought they had read with the utmost care. Then of course there are the cases where a correction is misunderstood. I recall an amusing instance of this which happened to a friend of mine. He chanced to prefer a somewhat unusual spelling of a word—I think it was that disputed word `rhyme' which at one time it was the custom of many English scholars to spell `rime.' It happened that this occurred twice or thrice in a particular page and the printer's reader had carefully queried all the instances. The usual way of indicating that the text is correct as it stands is of course to strike out the query and write the word `stet' in the margin, but as there were several instances, my friend, perhaps somewhat pedantically, thought the plural should 7be used, and wrote `stent' in the margin—a word unfamiliar to the compositor, who promptly substituted `stent' for the word `rime' wherever it occurred, with very comic results. And there are cases too of comments of other kinds getting into the text in this way. I cannot, I regret to say, give you any certain example of this from early work, but one which was pointed out to me by the Librarian of the Taylor Institution at Oxford, Mr. L. F. Powell, as occurring in a book printed only three years ago is so nice that I cannot refrain from quoting it. It is to be found in Professor Ashton's translation of Mme de la Fayette's Princesse de Cleves published by Routledge in 1925, page 216. It seems that the printer's reader had annoyed Professor Ashton with constant queries as to his translation, until at last in exasperation the Professor added in the margin of the proof a somewhat forcibly expressed request to the proof-reader to desist from his interpolations. The result was the following curious passage. I need hardly say that as Mme de la Fayette was the author of the romance in question her own name does not occur in the narrative. “As soon as this journey was mentioned, Madame de Cleves, who was still at home feigning illness, begged her husband to permit her not to go to Court, but to leave for Coulommiers, in order to get into the open air and care for her health. He told her that he did not want to pry into the question of whether it was her health that obliged her not to go on this journey, but that he consented to her not going, but for God's sake to stop bobbing up between Madame de la Fayette and me. He had no difficulty in consenting to something that he had already decided upon.” etc. The translator's remark `for God's sake stop bobbing up between Madame de la Fayette and me' is so neatly inserted in the text that one cannot help suspecting that the compositor was not merely a simpleton! But the possibility of error in a printed text is not limited to errors of actual composition or of corrections though these are undoubtedly the most important from the point of view of the textual critic. There are one or two errors of a larger kind which sometimes occur and of which a word may be said in conclusion. Firstly, a compositor may get the leaves of his MS. in the wrong order, or he may overlook one or more leaves. I do not know of any book which has actually got printed with the whole of the matter inverted so that it began with the closing paragraphs, and ended with the opening ones, but there is a famous instance of a book being sent out in proof in that form, namely Goldsmith's Traveller, originally called `A Prospect of Society.' Presumably Goldsmith did not number the leaves of his MS. but simply handed them to the printer as written or fair copied, with the last on the top. The printer, who perhaps did not expect a poem to make sense, set them up as he found them, and the proof, a copy of which may be seen in the British Museum, began accordingly with lines 353-400 of the poem, these being followed by lines 311-352, these by 277-310 and so on, the whole thing being in a series of chunks of some 35 to 40 lines, no doubt each representing a page of MS. put together in the reverse order. It may be mentioned that Goldsmith made very extensive alterations in the poem in proof besides restoring the lines to their correct order, but it is clear on careful examination that the original setting of type was used. Omissions of passages due to the loss of portions of text are, however, not uncommon. They are of course generally discovered and corrected by means of errata. What is perhaps the most important instance of this occurred in the first Quarto of 2 Henry IV in which, as first issued, the opening scene of Act III was omitted altogether. On the discovery of the error the sheet which should have contained the scene was reprinted with two additional leaves. There are also a few instances of blocks of matter which presumably represented an original page of MS. being inserted in the wrong place, but such gross errors are as a rule easily detected and give little trouble to the textual critic. Secondly, in making up his pages into formes, i.e. in arranging them so that paper printed from them may, when folded, form sheets of the printed book, a compositor may get certain pages out of the proper order. This mistake is a rare one, for the arrangement of the pages in a forme is at the same time so important and so elementary a part of the printer's training, that error here must mean the greatest possible carelessness. Owing to the presence of catchwords in most early books it is also an error which as a rule can very easily be detected. It does, however, at times occur. Lastly, there is a not uncommon fault due to what is called wrong perfecting, namely placing sheets one side of which has been already printed, on the machine the wrong way round. This results in confusion in the order of the pages. Thus in a quarto the pages, instead of running, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on, will run 1, 6, 7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 8. This is a very simple error which occasionally is found even in modern books, and though perhaps puzzling to those entirely ignorant of the way in which books are printed will trouble no one with the most elementary knowledge of the subject. In concluding these lectures I cannot but feel that to some of you whose interest in literature is purely aesthetic—and ultimately what interest can there be in literature save the aesthetic?—much of what I have said must have seemed irritatingly trivial. To a great extent I sympathize with such a view. It is indeed irritating that we should have to go such a long way round and spend so much time in apparently irrelevant matters, in order to approach work which was written in order to be enjoyed, and which only in so far as it can be enjoyed is worth our attention to-day. It would have been so much better if impeccable texts of our early writers had been handed down to us together with all necessary biographical and other information to enable us to appreciate them to the full. Unfortunately none of Shakespeare's contemporaries saw the need of doing this. It is annoying, and I fear that some of the annoyance has been diverted from those careless people who neglected their duty to those of us who are doing the best we can to restore the damage due to their neglect. But at least such detailed study of the transmission of a text as has been the subject of these lectures does no harm. There is a very real pleasure in the pursuit of truth, in whatever way and in respect of whatever subject we seek it; and there is certainly this to be said that although too much study of other peoples' opinions about a great writer may easily lead to boredom and to loss of interest in the writer himself, one's own investigations and attempt to form one's own opinions never do this. Rather, the further one goes, the more interesting does the subject of one's enquiry become. Lastly, do not let us in the pursuit of truth be afraid of the charge of pedantry. It is, as a rule, a charge brought against a man who knows his job by one who is conscious of not knowing it and is secretly ashamed of this. But let us as editors and as textual critics, having learnt our job as well as we can, be humble about it; for knowledge is not everything in matters of this kind. As the most successful researcher in scientific matters is held to be the one who, having thoroughly mastered all the available data of his subject so that they have become a part of himself, then—and not till then—proceeds to use his imagination; so, I think, the most successful textual critic is one who having first thoroughly familiarized himself with what I may term the mechanical side of his subject, then, with this relegated, as it were, into the background, uses his literary judgement, and that alone. The really successful and convincing emendation of a corrupt passage, such an emendation as Theobald's famous `a babbled o' green fields' is indeed a form of inspiration; but such inspiration comes seldom to anyone save as a result of prolonged and intensive study of his problem, and of the careful consideration of every factor, however seemingly unimportant, which can in any way contribute to its effective solution. EDITORIAL COMMENTARY 10.33 ought to have written] In “Shakespeare's Text” (159-161), McKerrow displays a more cautious attitude, apparently sympathising more both with the needs of what he calls the “aesthetic reader” and with the work of Rowe and Pope. He takes a similar stance in Prolegomena, 33-36. 10.41 `stands' for `stand'st'] Cf. Coriolanus I.v.25, “Oh noble fellow / Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword / And, when it bows, stand'st up!” In his 1709 edition Rowe emended the Folio reading “stand'st” to “stands”. (This, incidentally, seems to confirm the word order given above, “`stands' for `stand'st'”.) McKerrow did not re-use this example in his later essays and in the Prolegomena. 11.35 other persons] See A. W.

One wonders if this statement was left in its ambiguous form by chance, or if this was meant as a polemical hint. (See also the present editor's introduction.) 14.36-37 “I write... understood”] McKerrow is apparently quoting from Greville's original letter to Hickes of 18 January 1600/1 in British Library Lansdowne MS 88/1 (the manuscript reads, however, “annother”). 15.5 a pamphlet of his] The pamphlet in question is The Terrors of the Night; cf. The Works of Thomas Nashe, ed. R. B. McKerrow (5 vols., 1904-10), rev. Frank Percy Wilson (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1958), I, 341; cp. also IV, 450. 15.35-16.7 Thus Henry Chettle... into type] McKerrow re-used this section (the quote is not modernized) on p. 145 in “Elizabethan Printer,” where he provides the source for this passage: “`To the Gentlemen Readers' prefixed to Kind-Harts Dreame ” (note 1, p. 156). The only significant variant in “Elizabethan Printer” is the smoothing of the passage “this was the copy which was afterwards printed from” to “it was from this copy that the work was afterwards printed”. 16.31 licenser's fair copy] For a recent account (still agreeing, on the whole, with McKerrow) of licensing and prompt-books in this period see David Bradley, From Text to Performance in the Elizabethan Theatre: Preparing the Play for the Stage (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

Arthur Quiller-Couch and John Dover Wilson (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

Gaskell, New Introduction, 110-116. 28.24 elsewhere] Introduction, 241-246. 28.30 To pacify... angry ] The source for the quotation is given in Introduction, 242, as “Sir John Harington's Epigrams, ed. 1618, bk. ii, epigram 23”. 29.2 Mr. Pollard has remarked] “See [...] Professor A. W. Pollard's introduction to the facsimile of Mr. A. W. White's unique quarto of Richard II, 1916, p. 35” ( Introduction, 244 n. 2). 29.11 I doubt it] The question marks together with the “a&lt;nd&gt;” found in the margins of CT may suggest that McKerrow had also thought of another explanation, namely that the manuscript originally read “and” but blotting or damage made it impossible for the compositor to discern the letters after the initial “a”. 29.17 J. C. Zeltner] “John Conrad Zeltner, in his book entitled C. D.

McKerrow re-used the section on Spenser (from “In the one-volume” to “under 4,000”) with minimal variations in “Elizabethan Printer,” 141-142. In the article he added, after this (142-143), an extra example from Robert Greene's News Both from Heaven and Hell, followed by virtually the same text found in the next paragraph (“Lastly... complaint here”; the only significant variant here may be “Titesius” for “Titesias”). 45.41 Grosart] Edmund Spenser, The Complete Works in Verse and Prose, ed.

McKerrow, II, 227; interestingly, this edition reads, however, “anckle”, following the second edition of 1594, sig. C1 v . One wonders if this is just a coincidence; McKerrow's insistence in these lectures on the errors in later “reprints” (i.e., editions), on the fact that spelling is more and more subject to normalisation as editions continue, and on the unlikely possibility that the authors would have read proofs of reprints, may point to an increasing dissatisfaction with his own practice in The Works of Thomas Nashe. Even when certain that there are authorial revisions in a later edition, that is, McKerrow might be implicitly questioning the theoretical validity of basing the whole text on that edition.

      <field name="heading_text">The Concept of Format by G. THOMAS TANSELLE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A few bibliographical terms are widely used by the general public, though usually with somewhat different meanings from those understood by bibliographers. An example is “first edition,” taken to signify what bibliographers would call “first printing.” Perhaps the most common such term is “format,” which has spread far beyond its application to books: people speak of the format of a television show or a ceremony, where the term refers to the nature and order of the contents. Even when it is applied to printed matter, it sometimes carries this sense; magazine editors, for example, when they talk about the formats of their magazines, may well be referring to the kinds of material included and to the ordering of the items. They might, however, mean the layout, typography, and overall dimensions of the journal; and nearly everyone follows the software makers' practice of using “format” to mean the spatial arrangement of an electronic text as it is displayed on a terminal screen or on paper. Librarians, too, in recent decades have spoken of “reformatted” texts when they mean texts reproduced by microfilming, xerography, digitization, or any other means. These usages at least begin to approach the bibliographer's concerns by focusing on physical and design characteristics rather than intellectual content. But they still do not reflect what bibliographers mean by the term.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bibliographers need a word to express the relationship between the physical structure of finished books and some of the printing-shop routines that led to that structure, and they have long used “format” for this purpose. (Students of manuscripts, despite a less firm tradition, have equal use for a concept that connects physical structure with scribal procedures.) In bibliographical scholarship, the word does not mean simply the size and shape of a book. It is true that the dimensions of the leaves of a book form a visible manifestation of the processes of imposing type-pages in particular arrangements, printing sheets from the type so arranged, and folding the printed sheets; but the mere measurement of the leaves does not give one any information about those processes. A physical description of a book logically includes leaf dimensions, but bibliographical description at its most useful goes beyond the details that strike the eye and involves analysis of how those details came about. The identification of format illustrates the inextricability of description and analysis: not only is the manner in which leaves are held together a basic fact about a book as a physical object (books with identical leaf- dimensions may have very different structures); but so is the knowledge, for example, that the type for a half-sheet at the end of a book was on the press at the same time as the type for one at the beginning, or that a particular pair of leaves was inserted into a whole-sheet gathering and therefore came from a different sheet of paper printed at a different time. Such information results from the kind of investigation that is inherent in the determination of format.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If bibliographical scholars are generally in agreement on these points, a precise definition of this particular concept of format is remarkably elusive. It must be said, however, that many bibliographers have not recognized any problem in the commonest definition, which links the term solely with the number of times sheets are folded to form the leaves of a book (one fold producing folio, two creating quarto, three making octavo, and so on). When full sheets as manufactured were placed on the press and were printed from formes that would fill one side of a sheet, there would seem to be no problem in using this familiar definition—and a great many books, after all, were printed this way. But a definition of a concept is scarcely satisfactory if it does not encompass all situations, and this one does not. Sometimes, for example, the pieces of paper placed on the press were smaller than the sheets as manufactured; sometimes the type (or other material used to create a printed image) for one side of a sheet was not all laid on the press at the same time; and sometimes (if a web-fed press was used) the paper was in the form of a sizable roll rather than individual sheets. Facing such situations, bibliographers have had difficulty in deciding how to apply the idea of format. Furthermore, any definition based solely on paper-folding is not entirely satisfying, since—for the process that “format” refers to—the number of page-units involved is as essential a fact as the folding of the paper. Yet a definition based only on type-pages has its own problems, as when presswork proceeded by single pages rather than full-sheet formes of type. I shall attempt below, after surveying how “format” has been used, to examine these questions and propose an answer, applicable both to printed books and to manuscripts. 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Any survey of how the word “format” has been applied to books must acknowledge that the particular concept we are concerned with here, dealing with book structure and the process that produced it, is not a part of the word's meaning to everyone in the book world. The book-dealer who in the early 1990s advertised a ruler that translated inches into format terms was a source of great hilarity to bibliographical scholars. 2 But that ruler was only one manifestation of the same approach to format that the bibliographer Falconer Madan had seriously advocated many decades earlier 3 —or that causes many librarians and dealers to have special shelves for “folios,” meaning simply large books, whether or not they were produced in the manner that would cause bibliographers to call them folios. This usage is the one supported by general dictionaries. The Oxford English Dictionary, for example, defines “format” as “Shape and size of a book, e.g., octavo, quarto, etc.” (2nd ed., 1989). For the derivation of the word, the OED relies on Paul-Emile Littré's Dictionnaire de la langue française (1863-77), which traces it to liber formatus, meaning a book formed (shaped) in a particular fashion. The Latin “forma” had been used, at least by the fifteenth century, to mean “size” in connection with books, as in “forma magna.” 4 The earliest English instance of “format” located by the OED is in a 25 February 1840 comment made by Thomas Moore and first published in the seventh volume (1856) of John Russell's edition of Memoirs, Journal, and Correspondence of Thomas Moore: “Found from Tom Longman that there is some chance of their being able to bring out the `History,' some time or other, in a better shape than that vile Lardnerian format ” (p. 272). Presumably Moore was referring to the short stubby appearance of The Cabinet Cyclopaedia, edited by Dionysius Lardner and published by Longman in many volumes between 1831 and 1851. This is of course probably not the very first time that the word was written down in an English-language context; but its italicization may suggest that it was not yet regarded as an English word, or at least that it had not yet become a common expression in English. In any case, one should not be surprised, with the legacy of “forma” and “formatus” behind it, that “format” as an English word was first used in this sense and that it has been so employed extensively ever since. 5 There is nothing wrong with this usage except when “shape and size” are thought to imply book structure, a danger that emerges in the OED 's own definition. Anyone reading “Shape and size of a book, e.g., octavo, quarto, etc.” in the OED can be expected to turn to the entries for “octavo” and “quarto” for clarification. “Octavo” (with citations starting in 1582) is defined as “The size of a book, or of the page of a book, in which the sheets are so folded that each is one-eighth of a whole sheet”; “quarto” (with quotations beginning in 1589) is defined as “The size of paper obtained by folding a whole sheet twice.” The obvious trouble with linking these two examples of “format” to the basic definition is that a knowledge of paper-folding tells one nothing specific about shape and size unless one knows the shape and size of the paper to start with. And though the general shape (proportions) of sheets of paper, at least for much of the hand-press era, was fairly constant, the size was decidedly variable (the smallest standard paper in the sixteenth century, for instance, being twenty or twenty-five centimeters shorter in both dimensions than the largest paper). 6 A folio can thus be smaller than a quarto if the folio is made from small paper and the quarto from large, and the book trade of the hand-press period recognized that size and shape had to be conveyed by a combination of two terms, one indicating paper size and the other the number of leaves produced by folding each sheet—as in “Crown quarto” or “Royal octavo.” 7 In this practice lies the source of the bibliographer's “format,” which requires the separation of these two elements. One of the interesting and complicating facts about the development of bibliographical terminology in English is that “format” came to refer, in bibliographers' hands, to process (imposition and folding) and the resulting structure rather than to dimensions. The progression could have gone the other way, but it did not; perhaps the reason is that the early New Bibliographers were drawing on what was (as we shall see below) a long-established continental tradition of using “format” in just this way. In any case, the result was that the specialist meaning of “format” for historians of the physical book diverged from the meaning of “format” in general usage in English. Nevertheless, that specialist concept, based on the process/structure side of the dichotomy, obviously existed in English thought long before English bibliographers decided to call it “format.” Printers, after all, had to deal with process and structure in approaching every piece of printing, and they necessarily recognized the reciprocity of paper- folding and number of type-pages required. Understandably, however, nonprinters were likely to focus on paper-folding, since the folded paper is what survives to be seen in copies of books. In 1658, for example, Edward Phillips's The New World of English Words: or, a General Dictionary declared, “A book is said to be in Duodecimo, when it is of twelve leaves in a sheet.” This statement can be regarded as an early expression of the bibliographical approach because it refers only to process and does not include any mention of paper size; it also—and in my view less appily—foreshadows later bibliographical practice in its emphasis on paper-folding over the number of type-pages involved. The phrase “in Duodecimo” here is worth noting because it reflects the early beginning of the tradition, among printers and nonprinters alike, of using “format” terms in such prepositional phrases: the OED cites occurrences of “in folio,” “in quarto,” and “in octavo” from the 1580s. (On the continent these expressions were, and still are, often hyphenated, as “in-folio,” and often treated grammatically as a single word, a noun.) But before the early twentieth century there was apparently no overall term in English for the concept that subsumes specific impositions, as designated by such phrases. Printers, of course, would have thought of “imposition” as the term, but it focuses on the arrangement of type-pages in a forme rather than on the relationship between the forme and the finished book (though that relationship is inevitably determined by imposition). The fact that we now idiomatically speak of a book being “in” a particular format but not “in” a particular imposition shows the extent to which the emphasis of “format” has gone the other way, toward the folded paper rather than the type- pages. Joseph Moxon in his Mechanick Exercises of 1683 did use a term, distinct from “imposition,” to mean what we would call “format”: the word is “volumn,” but Moxon was seemingly alone in this practice. In his section “Of Imposing,” he wrote, “There are four Volumns in use that are differently Imposed, viz. Folio, Quarto, Octavo and Twelves. ” 8 More significantly, his imposition diagrams had headings like “Imposing a Folio Sheet,” and yet the arrangement shown was that of the type-pages in the forme, not their mirror-image in the sheet. That references to the sheet and to the forme could be blended this way would seem natural to a printer, who would see the process as a whole and understand that a planned book-structure entails a particular imposition. The printer would thus take for granted the artificiality of separating the two, though obviously convenience would be served by having the diagrams themselves show forme arrangements. The long line of English printers' manuals in the two centuries after Moxon, often repeating each other verbatim, followed the same plan. John Smith's The Printer's Grammar (1755), Philip Luckombe's The History and Art of Printing (1771), Caleb Stower's The Printer's Grammar (1808), C. S. Van Winkle's The Printers' Guide (1818), John Johnson's Typographia (1824), T. C. Hansard's Typographia (1825), C. H. Timperley's The Printers' Manual (1838), William Savage's A Dictionary of the Art of Printing (1841)—all of these (and no doubt the others) are similar in that they do not use the word “format” and, under headings like “Of Imposing,” they present diagrams (or “schemes”) with such titles as “A Sheet of Folio.” 9 When a term on the order of “format” is needed, it tends to be “size,” as when Luckombe speaks of schemes “for imposing all the Sizes that regularly descend from Folio” (p. 434) or when Johnson says, “Schemes of various other irregular sizes might have been introduced” (p. 191). Nor does the word “format” seem to appear in such later standard manuals as John Southward's (his Practical Printing of 1882 had reached its sixth edition by 1911, and his Modern Printing of 1898-99 was in a fifth edition in 1921) or Theodore L. De Vinne's (his 1904 Modern Methods of Book Composition contains no entry for “format” in its thorough index). On the continent, however, there was a very different tradition: the word “format” was being used in printers' manuals in the seventeenth century. A beginning of a shift in the meaning of Latin “forma” can perhaps be seen in the 1608 Latin manual by Hieronymus Hornschuch, the Orthotypographia, where the phrase “in quaque librorum forma” appears in the discussion preceding the presentation of imposition schemes and where the first prose after the imposition diagrams begins “In hisce formis” (pp. 10, 15). When Hornschuch's book was translated into German by T. Heidenreich (with editions in 1634 and 1739), the word was rendered as “Format” (1739, pp. 12, 18). By 1653, Johann Ludwig Vietor used “format” as an established term in his Formatbüchlein, which consisted almost entirely of imposition diagrams containing “Format” in the headings (as in “Von dem Format in Folio”). Two more German manuals containing imposition schemes appeared in the seventeenth century, both with “Format” in their titles—Georg Wolffger's Format- Büchlein (1673) and Daniel Michael Schmatz's Format-Buch (1684)—and Samuel Struck's Format-Buch came along three decades later (1715). Similarly, Johann H. G. Ernesti's Buchdruckerey (1721) used “Format” in its titles for imposition diagrams, as did Christian Friedrich Gessner's Buchdruckerkunst (1740) and Buchdruckerei (1743). 10 Johann Hildebrand's Handbuch für Buchdrucker-Lehrlinge (1835)—to cite one German manual from the nineteenth century—had a section entitled “Formatbildung” and used “Format” in the general heading to the section of diagrams (pp. 51, 52). Although the first French manual (and the only one for sixty years after its publication), Martin Fertel's La science pratique de l'imprimerie (1723), did not use “format” in its section “Des Impositions... ” (pp. 139-178)—heading its diagrams instead with phrases like “L'Imposition d'un In-folio d'une feuille seulement” (p. 142)—French printers of the eighteenth century did employ “format,” explicitly linking it with paper-folding. Antoine-François Momoro's Traité élémentaire de l'imprimerie (1793), for instance, defined “format” as “Nom que l'on donne aux quantités de pages qui entrent dans une feuille. Ainsi on distingue les formats in-8°., des formats in-12., par la largeur des pages et par la différence des quantités de pages” (p. 178). And Bertrand- Quinquet's Traité de l'imprimerie (1799) said, “Chaque format prend son nom du nombre de feuillets que présente une feuille de papier” (p. 86). In the nineteenth century, Henri Fournier's Traité de la typographie (1825)— which, through four later editions, was the dominant French manual well into the twentieth century—used “format” routinely in the prose preceding and following the imposition diagrams (as in the reference to “les différents genres d' impositions désignés par les noms des formats,” p. 68), though not in the headings of the diagrams themselves (which followed the pattern of “In-Folio”). Thus on the continent “format” not only referred to type-page impositions but also was thought of in terms of the ultimate folded sheets. If the authors of printers' manuals are like analytical bibliographers in their recognition of the fundamental connection between the imposed number of type-pages and the structure of books, they are different in that their approach to process is prospective: they offer instruction in how to bring a book into existence. Bibliographers, in contrast, like all historians, work in the other direction and try to reconstruct processes from the traces that those processes have left. Writings that show how one can start with a printed book and recover from it a firm knowledge of how many pages a printer decided to print on each side of the sheets that made it up began to appear in the nineteenth century, and they offer the most direct testimony as to how the structural concept of “format” (if not the term itself) evolved among bibliographers. A first step in English is represented by Thomas Hartwell Horne's An Introduction to the Study of Bibliography (1814). His chapter “On the Forms and Sizes of Books” (pp. 288-292) began with the statement, “The form or size of a book depends upon the manner in which it is folded.” Although the reference to paper-folding may suggest that he was using “size” as the printers' manuals often did in their discussions of imposition, he more often used “form” for this purpose, and sometimes “size” referred only to dimensions. In any case, he proceeded to caution readers against confusing dimensions with manner of folding; such confusion, he said, would result in “very important bibliographical errors.” Rudimentary as his discussion was, it recognized that the determination of book structure is essential to bibliography. Furthermore, its exposition of the analytical use of the direction of “water-lines” (vertical in folio, horizontal in quarto, and so on) and the position of “water-marks” (based on their normally being centered in one half of the sheet) seems to reflect some understanding of the necessity for relating observed structure to the original sheets (and thus to the type-page arrangement required). One may also observe that the two words “form” and “size,” which Horne used inconsistently, are the same two words that later English bibliographers struggled with before they adopted “format,” sometimes distinguishing between them and sometimes using them interchangeably to mean what we now call “format.” To move forty years ahead to Henry Bradshaw is to take a giant leap in bibliographical insight, for Bradshaw's thinking provided the foundation on which the most fruitful later work has been built. As Paul Needham has shown, by 1861 Bradshaw had devised a collational formula that employed superscript fractions to indicate (in the numerator) the number of leaves per gathering and (in the denominator) the number of leaves in each sheet. A clear explanation of his system appears in a letter of 18 February 1863 to J. Winter Jones: I take the broadside sheet as it comes from the mill, as my standard or unit, and where the size of the page is that of half a sheet ½, we call it folio and I use the denominator 2; where one-fourth i.e. quarto I use 4, and so on, so that 10/2 means that the quire consists of 10 leaves or 5 sheets folded in folio, 8/4 would mean that the quire or signature contained 8 leaves (or two sheets) folded in quarto, and so on. 11 The denominator of his fraction is of course what we now call format, and the fraction itself showed his recognition that book structure was not adequately accounted for simply by noting the number of leaves per gathering. One needed, in addition, to know how each gathering was physically constructed—in other words, how the leaves in it related to each other (which ones came from the same sheet of paper, which were still conjugate at the sewing-folds, and which were separate leaves that had been inserted). Bradshaw understood (and stated in print in 1868 in The Printing of the Historia S. Albani ) that any useful notation for structure must distinguish regular pairs of conjugate leaves from inserted single leaves. Thus before “format” was employed in English for bibliographical analysis, Bradshaw had developed the concept in the form that has underlain all later responsible work. And he was aware that “format” was the word used on the continent. When in October 1882 he published the presidential address he had delivered a month earlier before the Library Association, he appended to it “A Word on Size-Notation as Distinguished from Form-Notation,” 12 the main purpose of which was to criticize the thinking of the Association's Size-Notation Committee. He rightly deplored the use of terms like “folio” and “quarto” to denote approximate leaf size and asserted that they “represent strictly not sizenotation but form-notation” (p. 36 [406]). One may at first think that by using “form” in this way he was linking the concept not only with paper-folding but with type-page imposition as well, since “form” or “forme” was the name for the total quantity of type placed on the press. 13 But he mentioned explicitly only paper in defining (for example) “quarto” as “a term which means that a page or leaf of the book is, in size, one-fourth part of the whole sheet of hand-made paper on which the book is printed” (p. 38 [408]). After explaining such notations as “4°,” the superscript “representing the termination of the word,” 14 he added, “Every possible form of folded sheet (the French format ),... could thus be represented by a perfectly uniform expression.” In contrast to the English, he went on, “Frenchmen seem to be generally taught these things as elementary facts” (p. 39 [409])—and one is tempted to add that the English confusion was abetted, if not caused, by the lack of a distinctive technical term and the resulting reliance on words like “size” and “form.” 15 In both France and Germany bibliographical scholars did indeed follow printers' usage in their countries and employed “format” in the way Bradshaw indicated. Léopold Delisle, for example, in 1886 began his list of “conditions matérielles” to be noted in describing incunables as follows: “Le format, qui sera déterminé par l'examen des pontuseaux du papier (verticaux dans les in-folio et les in-octavo; horizontaux dans les in- quarto).” 16 Anton Einsle, in Incunabel-Bibliographie (1888), dis- cussed “Das Format” as the fourth element in a description and similarly mentioned the chainline-direction test (p. 10). Ernst Voulliéme, in Die Incunabeln der Königlichen Universitäts-Bibliothek zu Bonn (1894), said, “Das Format ist nach der Stellung der Drahtlinien des Papiers, nicht nach der Grösse der Bücher, bestimmt” (p. vi). And Karl Dziatzko's “Ueber Incunabelnkatalogisierung” (1896) made this the first point of description: “Zahl der Bände und Format, dieses nach der Richtung der Wasserstreifen im Papier bestimmt” (p. 113). 17 The difference between continental and English usage is epitomized by the fact that when Einsle's work was translated into English (for the second English edition—1890, under the title The Book —of Henri Bouchot's Le livre of 1886), the section originally entitled “Das Format” was called “The Size,” and it contained the statement that “a sure means of distinguishing between these several forms is afforded by the position of the wirelines of the paper” (p. 329). Precisely how “format” moved into English bibliographers' vocabulary I have not yet discovered. Presumably the interchange between English and continental incunabulists brought it about. But in 1893 it was not yet established, for E. Gordon Duff found it necessary to use the awkward expression “form size” in his Early Printed Books. 18 After stating that confusion is caused by the “two opposing elements at work, size and form,” and after explaining why terms like “folio” and “quarto” (which “apply to the folding of the sheet”) are inappropriate for designating the measurement of nineteenth-century books, he said, “In describing old books, the old form size should be used”—as opposed, apparently, to “measurement size” (though he did not use this term). He then outlined the chainline-direction test as the way one can “very simply” determine the “size of an old book” (p. 206). In 1907 Cyril Davenport was still using “size” to refer to foldings, with some consequent confusion. He began one sentence, “The further foldings of 16°, 32°, and 64° are the same operations carried further, but although such sizes do exist....” Then on the next page he stated that the “sizes” (now meaning measurements) of folios vary considerably, adding, “The sizes of quartos and octavos are also very varied” ( The Book: Its History and Development, pp. 75-76). The likeliest link between the continental bibliographers and the New Bibliography in England would have been A. W. Pollard, who (in contrast to Greg and McKerrow) was a student of incunabula before turning his attention to books of the following two centuries. But, like Duff, he used both “size” and “form”: in his 1907 article on bibliographical description, he spoke of “the size (Folio, Quarto, etc.)”; in his preface, the same year, to his catalogue of J. P. Morgan's early books, he referred to a “book's technical size, i.e., as to whether it is folio, quarto, octavo, or any smaller size” (adding that these terms have to do with paper-folding, not measurements); in his 1908 introduction to the first volume of the British Museum incunable catalogue, he said, “The collation begins with the statement as to whether a book is printed in Folio, Quarto, Octavo, or any smaller form, these terms being used solely with reference to the number of times that the sheet of paper has been folded”; and in his 1910 article on “Bibliography and Bibliology” for the Encyclopaedia Britannica, he stated, “The `size' of a book is a technical expression for the relation of the individual leaves to the sheet of paper of which they form a part.” 19 Even if its exact route is not yet clear, the word “format” did show up four years later in one of the landmarks of the New Bibliography, McKerrow's “Notes on Bibliographical Evidence for Literary Students and Editors of English Works of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries” (in the Bibliographical Society's Transactions, 12 [for 1911-13; published 1914], 211-318). Regardless of where “format” first appeared in a scholarly bibliographical work in English (aside from Bradshaw's reference to it as a French word), one can at least say that McKerrow's was the most influential early use of it. The fact that “format” was at this time only beginning to come into bibliographical currency in English is illustrated by his fifth chapter. Entitled “The sizes of books. Folio, Quarto, etc.,” it referred at the outset to “the names given to the various sizes or rather `formats' of books” (p. 253). Since McKerrow's first task in the chapter was to explain why terms like “folio” do not refer to size, he obviously felt the need for a word other than “size” to designate this category of terms. But “format” was clearly not yet established for this purpose, since he used “size” in the chapter title and introduced the word “formats” (in quotation marks) with awkward indirectness—by saying “sizes or rather `formats' of books,” which seems (in contrast to the ensuing discussion) to imply that “format” is merely a preferred synonym for “size.” (“Format” appears only one other time in the seven-page chapter, in his statement that “the size alone will not tell us the format” [p. 255]; and in his concluding chapter “on folding in 12mo and 24mo,” he called these foldings “formats” [p. 316].) If “format” was not yet standard, however, the concept to which it referred had become “quite fixed,” he said, in bibliographers' practice: “the term[s] folio, quarto, octavo, etc., are used solely with reference to the number of times the original sheet of paper has been folded to form the leaves of the book” (p. 254). 20 Thirteen years later, he retained most of this wording in his revised and expanded version of the “Notes” published as An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927). But his substitution of “formats” for “sizes” in the title of the chapter shows how much more established “format” had become in English during the interval, as does his repeated use of the word in the body of the chapter, where the term seems to be taken for granted. The 1927 version of the chapter is considerably expanded, and it deals with more complications than the earlier version did, but it still essentially offers instruction in using chainline direction and watermark location as clues for determining format (vertical chain-lines, with watermark centered in the leaf, for folio; horizontal chainlines, with portions of the watermark centered at the gutters, for quarto; and so on). In a footnote, McKerrow acknowledged that he was approaching format through paper rather than type-formes: he referred to his fourth chapter, “where the question of the various foldings is discussed from the point of view of imposition of the type. We are here considering them from that of the finished and bound book” (p. 166). But in that chapter, although he did set up his imposition diagrams to reflect the type-forme rather than the printed sheet, he nevertheless described several impositions in words only in reference to the number of leaves into which a sheet would be folded. 21 From McKerrow on, the concept of format, so named, was regularly explained in terms of paper-folding. Arundell Esdaile, in A Student's Manual of Bibliography (1931), for example, though he gave no formal definition of format, implicitly linked it with folding when he said in the third sentence of the section entitled “Format,” “The basis of the structure of the book is the folding of the sheets of paper to form the leaves” (p. 230). 22 J. D. Cowley, in another standard textbook, Bibliographical Description and Cataloguing (1949), stated succinctly (if awkwardly) that format is “the manner in which the sheets of which it [a book] is composed were folded” (p. 91). He went on to note that the Oxford Bibliographical Society, under the influence of Falconer Madan, recommended the use of format terms to refer to size, 23 and he observed that “otherwise it seems now to be generally recognized that the terms denoting folding or format are not to be used to indicate height or shape” (p. 93). The same year, Fredson Bowers, in his now classic Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), never formally defined format, and his section entitled “Format” (pp. 193- 196) began by referring the reader to McKerrow's explanation of the methods for determining it. In a subordinate clause on the second page, however, he said that “format is based on the full sheet,” and his whole discussion presupposed a paper- based concept of format. And Allan Stevenson, in his comprehensive introduction to the second volume (1961) of the Hunt botanical catalogue, defined folio as “each sheet folded once,” quarto as “each sheet folded twice,” and so forth. 24 E. W. Padwick, however, in Bibliographical Method: An Introductory Survey (1969), made a departure from this tradition when he said, “The format, besides showing how the sheets were folded, also suggests how the type-pages were imposed in the forme” (p. 65). But because this book has not had the distribution of the one Philip Gaskell published three years later ( A New Introduction to Bibliography, 1972), Gaskell's formal definition of format (p. 80) is a more important instance of including type-formes in the conception of format: In bibliographical usage the format of a book of the hand-press period means the arrangement of its formes and the subsequent folding of the printed sheets as indicated by the number and conjugacy of the leaves and the orientation of the paper in the gatherings. This definition raises a number of questions, even when one limits it—as Gaskell does—to the hand-press period. For example, is the “arrangement” of the formes crucial, rather than simply the number of type-pages? In other words, do the impositions, say, for common and for inverted duodecimo result in two different formats? And to say that the folding is “indicated” by the number and conjugacy of the leaves and the chainline direction does not make clear how ambiguous and inconclusive those features can be. (Furthermore, does conjugacy refer only to leaves joined at the gutter fold? Different imposition schemes for what are usually regarded as the same format can result in different patterns of conjugacy at the other edges of the leaves.) I shall return to these questions later; at the moment my only point is that Gaskell's definition, despite its limitations, moves in a useful direction by explicitly linking format with formes of type as well as with paper. Nevertheless, as far as its implications for his own book are concerned, Gaskell's definition might as well have been the usual paper-based one, 25 for his discussions of the analysis of format (as in the four steps he outlines under the heading of “The Identification of Format” on p. 84) focus on paper evidence. Since he does not show how typographic evidence also has a role to play in the consideration of format, his book in effect does not break from tradition and does not develop the promising hint incorporated into his definition. It is not necessary to multiply examples of the tradition beyond those I have mentioned. The unanimity of these influential introductory works shows that bibliographers have thought of format primarily in terms of paper-folding, even though they understood that the folding is dictated by the prior imposition of the type-pages. Codicologists have given far less attention to the conceptualization of format in manuscript books; but there has been an assumption—despite the fact that many manuscripts can be shown to have “impositions”—that the folding of paper or vellum provides the link with the concept of format in printed books. 26</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2 Many other dealers (in both printed books and manuscripts), without the misplaced precision of such a ruler, have used format terms to refer to size; and my exasperation with this practice caused me, some thirty-three years ago, to publish a brief article in AB Bookman's Weekly, a journal often read by dealers, many of whom used it to list books wanted and for sale (“The Sizes of Books,” 39 [5-12 June 1967], 2330, 2332). The protest was of course futile. 3 As in his contribution to “Standard Description of Printed Books,” Oxford Bibliographical Society Proceedings and Papers, 1 (1922-26), 55-64. (For further discussion of his approach, see note 23 below.) 4 As Paul Needham points out in “A Note on the History of Format Names,” which is Appendix III (pp. 141-145) of his “Res papirea: Sizes and Formats of the Late Medieval Book,” in Rationalisierung der Buchherstellung im Mittelalter und in der frühen Neuzeit, ed. Peter Rück and Martin Boghardt (1994), pp. 123-145. In this appendix Needham assembles quotations illustrating format terms from twenty-nine Italian documents, 1415-1501, and on the basis of those quotations offers some thoughts on the history of the development of format designations. 5 In 1895 it was still being italicized (and employed in this general sense by a person involved in book production) when an interview with William Morris was published in the Christmas number of Bookselling (pp. 2-14). Morris, speaking about the Kelmscott Press edition of The Earthly Paradise, then under way, is quoted as having said, “I am rather exercised as to its format, but Cockerell is in favour of this new size—a sort of mild quarto, and yet looking like an octavo.” See “The Kelmscott Press: An Illustrated Interview with Mr. William Morris” (signed “I. H. I.”), reprinted in Morris's The Ideal Book: Essays and Lectures on the Arts of the Book, ed. William S. Peterson (1982), Appendix B (quotation from p. 112). (I am grateful to Paul Needham for calling this reference to my attention.) 6 On paper sizes in incunables, see Needham's “Res papirea” (see note 4 above), pp. 125-135, and his “Aldus Manutius's Paper Stocks: The Evidence of Two Uncut Books,” Princeton University Library Chronicle, 55 (1993-94), 287-307. Philip Gaskell provides a historical table of paper sizes in A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972), pp. 72-75. 7 In the case of folio, the term reflects not the number of leaves but the fact of the fold itself. The word “folio” is obviously not parallel to the other format terms, since it does not incorporate a numeral reflecting the number of leaves in a sheet (or, to put it another way, the fraction of a whole sheet represented by each leaf). Needham (see note 4 above) has suggested that “folio” as a format term may have resulted from the fact that sheets of paper were folded once at the paper mills before shipping and that printers would have visualized paper in terms of the leaf, or “folium,” produced by folding sheets once; they may then have applied the same word to the format that results when printed sheets were folded once. 8 See Herbert Davis and Harry Carter's edition (1958; rev. 1962) of Moxon, p. 223. In a footnote, they conclude (after checking the OED ) that “the use of `volume' [sic] to mean `format' is peculiar to Moxon.” 9 For fuller references to these manuals (and to the continental ones mentioned below), see Philip Gaskell, Giles Barber, and Georgina Warrilow, “An Annotated List of Printers' Manuals to 1850,” Journal of the Printing Historical Society, 4 (1968), 11-31. 10 I have abbreviated these titles to their essential words; full titles can be found in Gaskell (see the preceding note). The prominence of the word “Format” on the title pages can be illustrated by Schmatz's book: its full title begins Neu-vorgestelltes auf der lüblichen Kunst Buchdruckerey gebräuchliches Format-Buch, but the words “Format- Buch” occupy a line by themselves, in the largest type used on the page. For eighteenth-century Dutch printers' use of “formaat,” see David Wardenaar, Beschrijving der Boekdrukkunst (1801; pp. 200-204 of Frans A. Janssen's 1982 edition, Zetten en Drukken in de achttiende Eeuw ). 11 “Letters of Henry Bradshaw to Officials of the British Museum,” ed. A. W.

Francis Jenkinson (1889), pp. 371-409 (this appendix on pp. 406-409). 13 The spelling “form,” often employed by the earlier English printers, has continued to be the spelling used by American printers; bibliographical scholars, however, have preferred “forme.” This difference is illustrated on one page (p. 340) of Davis and Carter's edition of Moxon (see note 8 above): in Moxon's text the spelling is “form,” and in the commentary at the foot of the page the editors use “forme.” 14 He noted that “the French use the formula `in-4', the German use `4.', while the English use indifferently `4to.' or `4°'”; and he registered his preference for the last. 15 Bradshaw's contemporary William Blades, for example, certainly understood the difference between leaf dimensions and what we now call “format,” but he encouraged confusion by using “size” to mean both. On a single page of his landmark work he first spoke of the binder “folding all his sheets into quarto, octavo, &amp;c., according to the size of the book” (thus using “size” as some of the English printers' manuals did), and then he commented on the half-sheet printing of “the quarto sizes” ( The Life and Typography of William Caxton, 2 [1863], xlviii). 16 Instructions pour la rédaction d'un inventaire des incunables conservés dans les bibliothèques publiques de France (1886; extract from Bulletin des bibliothèques, 3), p. 3. (My thanks to Vincent Giroud for checking the Yale copy of this pamphlet.) The 1910 edition (with a title beginning with the added words Instructions pour la rédaction d'un catalogue des manuscrits et pour ...) retains the text quoted here (p. 52). 17 Dziatzko's essay is in Sammlung bibliothekswissenschaftlicher Arbeiten, 10 [“Beiträge zur Kenntnis des Schrift- , Buch-, und Bibliothekswesens,” 3] (1886), 94-133. For this reference and the three previous ones in this paragraph, I am indebted to Paul Needham, who generously spent time locating them in response to a query of mine. As he pointed out, Dziatzko's footnote to the words quoted here, in its criticism of Arnim Graesel's 1890 Grundzüge des Bibliothekslehre, indicates that Dziatzko was thinking of “Format” as the leaf-sheet ratio (whereas the example of Graesel shows that not every German use of “Format” took the word in this sense). 18 In the chapter entitled “The Collecting and Describing of Early Printed Books” (pp. 201-212). This book was part of a series (“Books about Books”) edited by A. W. Pollard. 19 “The Objects and Methods of Bibliographical Collations and Descriptions,” Library, 2nd ser., 8 (1907), 193-217 (quotation from p. 210); Catalogue of Manuscripts and Early Printed Books... Now Forming Portion of the Library of J. Pierpont Morgan (1907), p. x; Catalogue of Books Printed in the XVth Century Now in the British Museum. Part I (1908), p. xviii; Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th ed., 3 (1910), 908-911 (quotation from p. 909). 20 A further indication of the growing use at this time of “format” to refer to paper-folding is offered by Harry G. Aldis's The Printed Book (1916): in the chapter on “The Construction of a Book” Aldis spoke of “format (shape and size)” and then said, “The common designation of the size of a book as folio, quarto, octavo, or duodecimo... is not an indication of actual measurement, but of the number of times the full sheet of paper is folded after it is printed off” (p. 73). (It is worth noting that when John Carter and E. A. Crutchley came to revise this book in 1941, they eliminated the equation of “format” with “shape and size,” which they recognized as outmoded, and they thought of dimensions as the result of paper-folding: “measurements reached by folding them [sheets] once, twice... ” [pp. 63-64].) On the other hand, in the same year (1916) Henry R. Plomer used “form” rather than “format”: “Wynkyn de Worde printed some five-and-twenty in quarto, eschewing as a rule smaller forms” ( A Short History of English Printing, 1476-1900 —another book in Pollard's “Books about Books” series—pp. 29-30). 21 Here he used “size” (sometimes held over from the 1914 version) instead of “format” and introduced the latter in quotation marks only to postpone discussion of it (pp. 34, 36). In Appendix 5, “On Folding in 12mo and 24mo” (pp. 325-328), repeated from chapter 20 of the “Notes” (pp. 315-318), he not only used the word “formats” (p. 325) but also spoke of determining “the arrangement of the pages in the formes” by discovering “the manner of folding” (p. 328). (The difficulties McKerrow had with imposition—including his erroneous quarto diagram in both the “Notes” [pp. 228-229] and the Introduction [pp. 16-17] and his erroneous octavo diagram in the 1928 and later printings of the Introduction [p. 35]—are discussed by David L. Vander Meulen in “Revision in Bibliographical Classics: `McKerrow' and `Bowers,'” SB, 52 (1999), 215-245 [see pp. 225-229].) 22 Roy Stokes, when in 1967 he revised Esdaile's book for the second time, added a formal definition: “The format of a book is the term used to describe it in accordance with the number of times and manner in which the original sheet was folded” (p. 237). 23 Madan—from the time of his work on Oxford Books in the 1880s—was the perennial champion of this thoroughly illogical system (essentially like the one advocated earlier by the Library Association and criticized by Bradshaw). In his “Degressive Bibliography,” Transactions of the Bibliographical Society, 9 (1906-8), 53-65, Madan said that in “short” and “minimum” descriptions, terms like “folio” and “quarto” “may be used to indicate simply linear size,” and he provided a table converting inches to such terms (p. 63). A decade and a half later he, E. Gordon Duff, and Strickland Gibson joined together to produce “Standard Descriptions of Printed Books” for the Oxford Bibliographical Society (see note 3 above). Each author was responsible for a different period, and each recommended differing treatments for “important,” “interesting,” and “ordinary” books (obviously a nonbibliographical classification). Madan's recommendation for the “middle period” (1558-1800) included, as before, a “table of linear measurements” giving the heights that supposedly corresponded with such designations as “4°,” “sm. 4°,” “obl. 4°,” etc. (see the section on “Size,” p. 57). The last page of this article consisted of an “Additional Note on Size Notation” by R. W. Chapman, who offered an admirably cogent criticism of Madan's approach. “When Bibliography is analytical as well as descriptive,” he said, “and its object is not merely to indicate what the bound book is like and what it contains, but also to show how it was put together, then it is important to indicate not only the gathering which constitutes a `signature' (often inaccurately called a sheet) but also, if it can be determined, the constitution of the sheet as printed.” Therefore, he went on, “bibliographers dealing with what is here called the Middle Period will find it necessary to use the old terms in the old way”; Madan's scheme “is likely to lead to further confusion in a subject already involved in some perplexity.” (For Paul Needham's comments on Madan, see The Bradshaw Method [1988], p. 28.) 24 Catalogue of Botanical Books in the Collection of Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt, 2 (1961), ccxxix. Two widely used glossaries of the time also emphasized paper-folding but associated it with size. John Carter, in his ABC for Book-Collectors (1952), stated that “format” was sometimes used “to mean the general shape, style or appearance” of a book but that “its proper meaning is the size, as expressed by the number of times each sheet has been folded” (p. 89). Geoffrey Ashall Glaister, in his Glossary of the Book (1960), defined format as “a loose indication of the size of a book, being based on the number of times the printed sheets have been folded” (p. 144). 25 The same could be said of Padwick, who asserted—a hundred pages after the comment quoted above—“The format is a statement of how the sheets of paper were folded to form gatherings” (p. 165). 26 The most thoughtful introduction to the subject of format in manuscripts is a three-paragraph passage in Paul Needham's “Res papirea” (see note 4 above), pp. 127-128—which includes some commentary on Carla Bozzolo and Ezio Ornato's pioneering treatment in Pour une historie du livre manuscrit au moyen âge: trois essais de codicologie quantitative (1983). On the “impositions” of manuscripts, see, for example, G. I. Lieftinck, “Medieval Manuscripts with `Imposed' Sheets,” Het Boek, 34 (1960-61), 210-220, and the papers by Charles Samaran (beginning in the 1920s) cited there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The traditional paper-based concept of format, which underlies the use of chainline direction and watermark position as evidence of how sheets had been folded to produce particular books, may lead to accurate results for the majority of books from the hand-press period. (Even the many books, especially in the second half of the eighteenth century, that were printed on “wove” paper, without chainlines, frequently offer conventional watermark evidence, at least before the 1790s.) But a considerable number of books from the hand-press period raise questions that have proved awkward for bibliographers who think of format only as an indication of how many times full sheets were folded; and since one cannot know in advance whether a given book falls into this category, it is best to approach every book with a more comprehensive concept of format in mind. One of the main classes of problematical books consists of those in which the chainlines run in the opposite direction, and the watermark is in a different position, from what would be expected on the basis of other evidence, such as the proportions of the leaves. McKerrow, in his 1914 “Notes,” called attention to “certain books of quarto shape in which the chain-marks run vertically as in an octavo” (p. 259), and he recognized the dilemma these books pose: “It is not clear whether in such cases the 8vo paper was a sheet of the size of two ordinary sheets, or whether in the mould used the chain-marks for some reason or other ran the opposite way from that which was usual” (p. 260). In other words, if the heavier wires (“chains”) ran, as was customary, parallel to the short dimension of the mould, the paper would have been double the “ordinary” size, in the sense that the short dimension of an “ordinary” sheet was doubled, forming the long dimension of the new sheet; otherwise, one would have to assume that the mould was constructed uncharacteristically, with the chains running parallel to the long dimension. 27 McKerrow did not pursue the question of what one should call the format of such books, and it is clear that he was thwarted in that process by conceiving of format in terms of paper, since crucial information about the original sheets was not known. Indeed, the example he cited (Hardyng's Chronicle, 1543) posed a further complication because some of its eight-leaf gatherings were in ordinary quarto with two sheets quired together (the chainlines were horizontal, and there were two watermarks per eight leaves), whereas the others had all the characteristics of octavo except its shape. To him, therefore, the book was illustrative of the “puzzles connected with format.” This passage remained the same in McKerrow's expanded Introduction to Bibliography in 1927 (though some further examples were added to a footnote, along with this statement: “Dr. Greg informs me that such mixtures of 4to and 8vo are not infrequent in dramatic literature of the early seventeenth century” [p. 174]). But in another passage he was unequivocal about basing format strictly on the original sheet: Suppose, for example, that a printer intending to print a small octavo wishes to use up some rather large paper. He could easily do this by cutting off one- third of each sheet and using the remainder exactly as a normal sheet for his octavo formes, making up every third gathering out of the two cut-off pieces placed one inside the other [these cut-offs having been printed together from octavo formes]. Such a book would actually have been printed as an octavo, but, as format depends on the original sheet, would have to be regarded bibliographically as a 12mo. (pp. 168-169) Whether this is a realistic example is beside the point; what is of interest for present purposes is that here McKerrow is clearly ruling out both imposition and the size of the paper actually brought to the press as elements of how a book is to be “regarded bibliographically.” Yet if a bibliographical approach encompasses all parts of the book- production process, it is hard to see why the number of type-pages on the press should necessarily be irrelevant or why the size of the sheet as manufactured should always be considered more important than the size that the printer altered it to before printing. When McKerrow says that the book was “ printed as an octavo,” he comes close to proposing a printing format distinct from a paper format, but he does not develop the point, falling back on the idea that “format depends on the original sheet,” without examining that idea critically. In the years following McKerrow's book, the first important contribution to thinking about format was a brief article by Allen T. Hazen, “Eighteenth-Century Quartos with Vertical Chain-Lines” ( Library, 4th ser., 16 [1935-36], 337-342). That title itself gives a clue to Hazen's conclusion, since he does call the books in question “quartos.” Hazen was able to answer McKerrow's query about whether paper might have been made in moulds with chains running parallel to the longer dimensions: by taking the practical step of visiting the Hayle Mill of J. Barcham Green &amp; Son, he learned that the chains must run parallel to the short sides of the mould (the sides grasped by the vatman) if the pulp was to be distributed properly. After thus eliminating one of the proposed explanations for “wrong-direction” chainlines in books, he proved that double-sized paper did exist, at least in the latter half of the eighteenth century, by analyzing some untrimmed copies of newspapers from that period. He believed he was therefore justified in concluding that books with “so-called irregular chain-lines were printed on half-sheets of a special paper which was in general twice as large as the regular papers” (p. 341). He then turned to the question of what format term should be applied to such books, and he based his recommendation on a belief that double-sized paper would normally have been cut in half before printing (“the principle of cutting before printing, it appears, may safely be con- sidered axiomatic” [p. 342]). (He did not speculate on the marketing of this paper and thus on whether the cutting took place before or after it arrived in the printing shop.) As a result, he felt that “one would be unnecessarily pedantic to insist” on denominating format according to the original size of the sheet; and he suggested that phrases on the pattern of “Quarto with vertical chain-lines” would be “simple, clear, and accurate” (pp. 341-342). Actually, mention of the chainline direction is not essential if it is referred to elsewhere (as it would be in a bibliographical description); the important point is that he is calling such a book a quarto, not an octavo in half-sheets. Instead of regarding the latter as “pedantic,” I would call it an example of the unthinking adherence to a traditional definition—unthinking because it does not take into account the underlying purpose of the terminology. Format terms are meant to tell one something about the process of book production; and if, as McKerrow insisted, format must always be based on sheets as manufactured, regardless of the presswork procedures followed, it will sometimes obscure rather than clarify that process. The size of original sheets can certainly be relevant to format (1) when whole sheets as manufactured were placed on the press, as they were for most books in the hand-press centuries, or (2) when printers—largely those before 1480—cut sheets prior to printing only as a means for achieving the same result as if they had used whole sheets (and their cuts were thus the equivalent of folds that would have been made after printing). But when abnormally large sheets were cut before printing to create ordinary-sized sheets, their original size is a fact with more relevance to the history of paper than to the analysis of the printing of particular books. And when, as in McKerrow's example cited above (in which a third of each sheet was cut off before printing), normal sheets were altered to create the desired size of full sheet for an ordinary imposition, the cutting was not an expedient for printing the original sheet and therefore was not the equivalent of folding after printing; thus again here it is the cut size, not the original size, that ought to be relevant for format. The same reasoning is applicable to manuscripts on paper, and it can be adapted for analyzing books printed or written on vellum, which was presumably not subject to such standardization of size as paper was. 28 The format of vellum books would relate simply to the size of sheet that was considered appropriate for a given job, whether the sheets were cut to that size before or after reaching the printing shop or scriptorium (it may not be possible in the case of vellum to identify preproduction cuts that were the equivalent of folding after production). The point of view I am advocating gains support from another consideration: that large moulds were used not only to produce double-sized sheets but also to make two regular sheets simultaneously. That Hazen did not consider this possibility is the primary flaw of his discussion: having ruled out the existence of moulds with chains running parallel to the longer axis, he assumed that “the use of paper that was approximately double the ordinary size is the only possible explanation for the irregular chain-lines” (p. 338). 29 But in 1950 Kenneth Povey and I. J. C. Foster reported the results of their search for books with “turned chain-lines”: using the evidence of deckle edges in untrimmed copies, they recorded a considerable number of books printed on paper with longitudinal chainlines. Not only did they find such books “fairly common from the end of the seventeenth century onwards”; they also concluded that “paper with chain-lines running lengthwise in the sheet... was a commoner cause of turned chain-lines than half sheets of double paper.” 30 Their discovery of paper with longitudinal chainlines, combined with the fact that the chains always ran the short way of the mould, 31 led them to recognize that side-by-side two- sheet moulds were in use by at least the late seventeenth century (and they cite some eighteenth-century references to such moulds). These moulds had a deckle with a central cross-bar, though they did not always have tranchefiles adjacent to this central bar. Thus in untrimmed copies of books displaying turned chainlines, paper made in such moulds can be distinguished from paper made in double-sized moulds without cross-bars by the fact that the former would have four deckle edges, whereas the latter would have one cut edge. 32 This circumstance makes clear the artificiality of arbitrarily basing format on the original size of the sheet: an apparent quarto with turned chainlines would be called a quarto if there was evidence that its paper came from side-by-side two-sheet moulds, but it would be called an octavo if there was evidence that its paper came from moulds of the same size without cross- bars. And if the paper evidence was unavailable, the format could not be named. But since—from the point of view of the process of imposing and printing—the two situations are the same, it does not seem reasonable to classify the finished books differently because of a difference in the manufacturing history of the papers. The work of Hazen, Povey, and Foster dealt primarily with the eighteenth century, but books with turned chainlines were not uncommon in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Despite the cogency of Hazen's suggestion, however, neither Greg nor Bowers, when approaching books of those earlier centuries, accepted the idea of basing format on cut sheets under certain circumstances. In A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration (1939-59), Greg used the expression “(4°-form) 8°” to describe a book printed from quarto formes on pieces of paper that had apparently (in his view) been created by cutting double-sized sheets in half before printing. When he discussed this formulation in his introduction, which appeared in the final volume, he described the situation in a curiously opaque manner. “So far... as my experience goes,” he said, “sheets of this sort were always folded three times, thus giving quires that are technically octavo but have the superficial appearance of quarto. They might be either eights or fours, according to whether the sheets were sewn as one or had been previously cut in half.” This statement is unclear, since cutting the sheets in half (whether before or after printing) would not preclude gatherings in eights. And the puzzle increases when one reads that “in fact it is doubtful whether any Elizabethan press was large enough to take the double sheet.” Greg is here making an unnecessary assumption about paper size: the paper need not have been of an unprintable size for the printer to have decided in a given instance to treat half-sheets as if they were full sheets (perhaps mixing them with smaller whole sheets), and of course the paper could also have been of a regular size but produced in a two-sheet mould. One may plausibly infer Greg's meaning to be that the sheets were cut before printing 33 and that the cut should be regarded as the equivalent of a fold. Even though the paper that was put on the press was thus of a normal size and resulted in four-leaf gatherings of the usual quarto shape, he still said, “I feel bound to describe books printed on this unusual paper (folded thrice) as octavos.” Because play quartos that contain vertical-chainline gatherings “not infrequently” also include some “ordinary quarto quires,” he suggested describing such mixed-paper copies as “4° and (4°-form) 8°” (p. 1vi). At the same time that Greg was working on the first volume of his Bibliography, William A. Jackson was preparing the Pforzheimer catalogue and was also confronting books with turned chainlines. In general, Jackson avoided commenting on the problems they posed, but his standard phrase in most of his entries for such books, “Octavo in fours,” shows that he simply regarded vertical chainlines as evidence of octavo format. 34 Thus he was essentially taking the same position as Greg, though he expressed no assumption about outsized paper. He did, however, recognize that the paper in some of these books was peculiar in other respects, as he noted in his one comment on the matter (in entry 656): Books of quarto size printed wholly or in part on paper with chainlines as in octavo are not particularly uncommon in sixteenth and seventeenth century printing—Dr. Greg has suggested that they might perhaps be called “bastard quartos”. But it does not appear to have been noticed that several of those printed early in the seventeenth century are on a similar unwatermarked rather thick paper with a streaked perpendicular texture. It happens the book being described (Marston's Antonios Reuenge, 1602) displayed horizontal chainlines in seven out of ten four-leaf gatherings, and he labeled it “Quarto,” appending a sentence to the collation: “Sheets G, H, and I are on octavo paper.” This statement is self-contradictory: “octavo paper” presumably means paper that would hold on each side eight pages (of the same size as those in the rest of the book), in which case G, H, and I would have to be half-sheets, not “Sheets.” But the key point here is that Jackson assumed from the direction of the chainlines that G, H, and I are in some sense “octavo” even though they were presumably printed from four-page formes. His treatment is somewhat less objectionable than Greg's since it does not postulate paper of an unprintable size; but, like Greg, he unwittingly demonstrated the illogicality of making chainline direction an essential determinant of format. 35 Bowers (aware of Greg's ideas even before the introduction to the Bibliography was published) agreed with Greg, and in the Principles (1949) he explicitly equated a pre-printing cut with a fold (in this instance referring to printing with a two-page forme): Since format is based on the full sheet, no matter what its size or shape, without regard for cutting before machining (cutting being treated as if it were a folding of the sheet), a book composed of this [“double-size”] paper with a divided half folded once is actually a quarto, even though the size and shape of a folio. (p. 194) To call the paper “double-size” (as he did in the preceding paragraph) is to make an unwarranted assumption about normality, just as Greg did, since it would have been possible for a printer to use half-sheets of regular paper as the equivalent of full sheets. In any case, because he believed that books with turned chainlines are “sufficiently out of the ordinary... to warrant special notation,” he endorsed the style of Greg's “(4°- form) 8°” and thus perpetuated an awkward usage that required the statement of format to be combined with information about the paper, 36 which can often in a full bibliography be more clearly recorded elsewhere (and which would have to be further described in any case). 37 And to speak of a book with mixed paper as “4° and (4°-form) 8°,” as Greg recommended, is to make a distinction that is not relevant to format. The fact that two different papers were used is unquestionably worthy of note (as it would be even if they had both been of normal size originally and all the chainlines had run the same direction on the leaves); but I think it can be argued that to complicate the description of format in this way is a mistake. Such books are simply quartos, printed throughout from four-page formes. The application of this approach to extreme situations can be illustrated by examining the 1570 edition of Foxe's Acts and Monuments, which is made up of two stocks of paper, one of them half the size of the other. The larger paper was printed in folio format, and thus each sheet was folded once for sewing; but the smaller paper had to be fastened in another way, since each sheet formed a single leaf. Ordinarily single leaves, when they are interspersed within sewn gatherings, are pasted in; but here the smaller paper, which was used when the supply of the larger was exhausted, constitutes many entire gatherings. To create sewing folds, the leaves that were required to be conjugate were pasted together, and the fold was made a short distance from the joint: in other words, one leaf provided a stub to which the other was attached. When Leslie Mahin Oliver analyzed the printing of this book, he concluded that the pasting occurred after printing and that each of the small sheets was printed from a one-page forme. If this analysis had been correct, the format of the book would have had to be stated as a combination of folio and full-sheet. But when Paul S. Dunkin examined the book, he found evidence that the small sheets were pasted together in twos before printing and that the printing was then no different from that of any other folio. (The evidence he used involved skeleton-formes and the fact that a trace of the inked text for one leaf appeared at the edge of the paper to which that leaf was attached.) 38 The whole book is therefore a folio, printed from two-page formes throughout. This example illustrates the importance of thorough analysis in the determination of format. Just as the paper selected for a given job can be cut down from larger sheets, so can it be made up from more than one piece of paper; and the area of paper surface required by the type-forme is more important for format than the original size of the paper. I do not mean to suggest that paper evidence is irrelevant to the discovery of format but rather that typographical and presswork evidence should be drawn on as well—a natural corollary to the idea that the number of type-pages involved is essential to the concept of format for printed books. Techniques for ascertaining which type-pages were in the same forme—such as tracing the recurrences of identifiable (damaged) types or locating the inked appearance of lines of type that were also used as bearers and left blind impressions—can provide a check on conclusions drawn from chainline direction and watermark position, 39 as can such evidence of imposition as point-holes, when they are still visible. And press figures, in those eighteenth-century books that contain them, can readily reveal the number of pages in a forme. 40 It is salutary to keep in mind not only that chainlines may run the “wrong” direction (or not be present at all) but also that watermarks and countermarks do not always appear in the usual positions. 41 Clearly Bowers offered a dangerous oversimplification when in the Principles he said, “In early books printed on a small press, the evidence of chainlines and watermarks in hand-made paper always reveals the precise format as applied to the number of leaves printed from a full sheet of paper” (p. 429). A sound approach to format analysis must employ all available evidence, including typographical clues and the incidence of point-holes, as well as other characteristics of paper besides chainlines and watermarks (such as tranchefiles and deckle edges). 42</field>
      <field name="fulltext">27 This second alternative does not logically preclude the possibility of double-sized paper, if it was the long dimension of the paper that was doubled, but McKerrow does not take note of this possibility. See also note 32 below. 28 On vellum sizes, see Needham, “Res papirea” (see note 4 above), pp. 126-127. 29 He had apparently not noticed Edward Heawood's discussion of a 1696 quarto with vertical chainlines, in which “all the fore-edges (apart from some trimming) correspond to the original margins of the sheets as shown by the smaller intervals between the extreme pairs of chain-lines.” See p. 45 of Heawood's “The Position on the Sheet of Early Watermarks,” Library, 4th ser., 9 (1928-29), 38-47. (It is true that Heawood thought this instance demonstrated the use of moulds with chains running the long way; but if Hazen had known of this example, he would—after eliminating this explanation—have been forced to consider moulds with central cross-bars and tranchefiles.) 30 “Turned Chain Lines,” Library, 5th ser., 5 (1950-51), 184-200 (quotation from p. 187). The motivation for using double-sized moulds was economic, since a larger amount of paper could thus be produced with little more effort or cost than making a smaller quantity. Hazen had come to the same conclusion; but since he was dealing only with double-sized sheets that were cut in half for the printing of newspapers, the real explanation in those cases was somewhat different, as Graham Pollard pointed out in 1941: the Stamp Act of 1712 imposed a duty of one penny per sheet for newspapers but did not specify the size of the sheet. Pollard asserted that double sheets were “created solely to satisfy the requirements of the Commissioners of Stamp Duties under the Act of 1712.” See pp. 125-129 of his “Notes on the Size of the Sheet,” Library, 4th ser., 22 (1941-42), 105- 137. 31 Povey and Foster (see the preceding note) confirmed this fact in the way Hazen did, by consulting a contemporary papermaker; but they made clearer than Hazen that the direction of the laid-wires, not the chain-wires, was the decisive factor (the close wires had to run perpendicularly to the edges grasped by the vatman if the pulp was not to clog against them). 32 Two-sheet moulds were also sometimes constructed so that the two sheets lay end to end rather than side by side. Given that the chains always ran parallel to the shorter sides of the mould, in these cases the chainlines would be parallel to the shorter edges of the paper, as in ordinary paper made from single-sheet moulds; and thus paper from end-to-end (in contrast to side-by-side) two-sheet moulds cannot be distinguished from ordinary paper by chainline direction. However, since two-sheet moulds did not always have tranchefiles beside the central cross-bar, a sheet made in an end-to-end two-sheet mould can sometimes be identified by its having a tranchefile at only one end. Moulds of this shape could also be used without the central-bar deckle to produce single long sheets of the kind found in some “oblong” music books; see p. 322 of D. W. Krummel's “Oblong Format in Early Music Books,” Library, 5th ser., 26 (1971), 312-324. 33 In drawing this inference, I am concluding that he did not consider, or ruled out, the possibility that folded sheets were placed on the press. I likewise infer that when he spoke of sheets “previously cut in half” he was referring to a cut before printing, not merely before folding. (Thus “sewn as one” would make sense here only if it assumed the printing of complete double-sized sheets; presumably Greg was trying to cover the theoretical possibility that such printing did occur.) These considerations are further indication of what an impenetrable muddle this passage of Greg's is. Of the twenty items in his Bibliography where “(4°-form) 8°” is employed (locatable through the very useful “Notabilia” index in the third volume), only one (153/154 b) is gathered in 8s—and there is every reason to expect that analysis would reveal it to have been printed either on the cut halves of large sheets or on sheets made in two-sheet moulds (therefore “sewn as one” would in this instance mean only “gathered together”). 34 See The Carl H. Pforzheimer Library: English Literature 1475-1700 (1940), entries 212, 224, 304A, 426 note, 772, and 773, for example. The corresponding phrase “Sextodecimo in eights” occurs in entry 786. 35 One might perhaps argue, since Jackson called the book simply “Quarto,” not “Quarto and octavo,” despite the printing of G, H, and I on “octavo paper,” that he was therefore giving greater weight to imposition than to the original paper size; but such an inference is belied by his practice in the other relevant entries cited above. 36 Another bibliographer who used the same kind of expression, but in connection with music printing from engraved plates, was Richard J. Wolfe: see his “ Parthenia In-Violata: A Seventeenth-Century Folio-Form Quarto,” Bulletin of the New York Public Library, 65 (1961), 347-364. In this case he identified the “commonplace practice” of using “double” or “oversize” plates, which could print two “oblong” page-units of music at the same time (p. 358); to accommodate these plates, “half-sheets were printed as though they were whole sheets and were then folded once over” (p. 348). But because Wolfe assumed that “format is dependent upon whole sheets” (p. 353), he felt that the format had to be quarto, and he labeled it “2°-form 4°” (p. 348). 37 Bowers appended a note to his discussion, calling attention to quartos with chain-lines in the usual horizontal direction but with watermarks in the octavo position (top inner corners). He concluded, with advice from Greg, that watermarks were no doubt placed differently in some moulds and that such books should be called quartos despite “the abnormal position of the watermark” (p. 195). The trouble with this kind of comment is that it seems to confuse the essence of format with the characteristics that are its usual by-product. That is, format refers to a relationship, not to chainline direction or watermark placement. 38 See Oliver, “Single-Page Imposition in Foxe's Acts and Monuments, 1570,” Library, 5th ser., 1 (1946-47), 49-56; and Dunkin, “Foxe's Acts and Monuments, 1570, and Single-Page Imposition,” Library, 5th ser., 2 (1947-48), 159- 170. 39 Except when, as in the early days of printing, only one type-page or a part-sheet forme was on the press at one time (see section V below). 40 In some late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century books there are also “sheet numbers” that can be used in the same way (since these are consecutive numbers labeling sheets in cases where more than one gathering came from each sheet). For further information about these various techniques, see G. T. Tanselle, “The Treatment of Typesetting and Presswork in Bibliographical Description,” Studies in Bibliography, 52 (1999), 1-57. See also B. J. McMullin, “Press Figures and Format,” Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin, 7 (1983), 109-119. Some kinds of potentially useful evidence do not often survive, such as the rules that were sometimes printed to mark where the binder should make the cut in small formats: on 12° and 24°, see Giles E. Dawson, “Guidelines in Small Formats (about 1600),” SB, 14 [1961], 206-208; on 18°, see McMullin, “`La Collection des petits formats in-18, édition de Cazin': Some Preliminary Observations,” in The Culture of the Book: Essays from Two Hemispheres in Honour of Wallace Kirsop, ed. David Garrioch, Harold Love, Brian McMullin, Ian Morrison, and Meredith Sherlock (1999), pp. 105-119 (see pp. 111-113). 41 See, for instance, Heawood's article cited in note 29 above. Other variations have also been noted: James Russell, for example, reported a book printed on paper in which every nineteenth wire-line was as heavy as a chainline (see “Cross `Chain Lines' in Early 18th Century Paper,” International Paper History, 3 [1993], 44- 46). 42 The use of such a combination of evidence is illustrated by Pamela E. Pryde in “Determining the Format of British Books of the Second-Half of the Eighteenth Century Gathered in Sixes,” Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin, 23 (1999), 67-77. For tranchefiles, see Annemie Gilbert and Sylvia Ransom, “The Imposition of Eighteenmous in Sixes, with Special Reference to Tranchefiles,” ibid., 4 (1979-80), 269-275. Point-holes and watermarks enter into Curt F. Bühler's discussion of a 24° gathered in 8s, in “The Printing of a Valerius Maximus Dated 1671,” SB, 7 (1955), 177-181; cf. Kenneth Povey, “Twenty-fours with Three Signatures,” SB, 9 (1957), 215- 216.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The study of books from the machine-press period also benefits from regarding format in terms of type as well as paper. Indeed, a focus on paper tests for format caused even so perspicacious a bibliographer as Henry Bradshaw to believe that the traditional format terms were “wholly inapplicable” to modern books. 43 It is true that in many instances the paper offers no help whatever; but there is still a possibility of determining format through typographical evidence. The extreme situation that dramatizes the point (a common situation, in fact, after the 1860s) is the production of printed matter on a web-fed rotary press, which takes paper in the form of a roll rather than individual sheets. If format is defined simply in terms of the folding of sheets of paper, then the concept is not appropriate for books and newspapers printed on web-fed presses. But it makes no sense to say that these items have no format, or to adopt a definition of format that is not applicable to all printed material, since obviously there was some finite number of page-units on the press at one time, and that number had a direct bearing on the structure of the item as finally produced. One could say, in other words, that the sheets to be folded were cut from the roll of paper after printing, their size having been determined by the area of printing surface on the press. 44 These items do, therefore, have a format in the most meaningful sense of that term, whether or not one is able to identify it in a given instance. And any attempt to establish it must focus on an effort to reconstruct the type-forme, since in these cases the forme may be the sole determinant of format. Difficulties in determining the formats of machine-press books are not, however, limited to items printed on web-fed presses. From the second quarter of the nineteenth century onward, the mechanization of the paper and printing industries allowed the production of much larger paper than was possible previously and also provided presses that could exert the requisite pressure over large enough areas to print on these large sheets. Thus in examining nineteenth- and twentieth-century books one always has reason to suspect that they were printed from formes containing the type-pages for several gatherings in the finished product. Many books gathered in eights, for example, were printed from formes of sixty-four pages, each of these large formes containing the outer or inner formes of eight eight-leaf gatherings (or, alternatively and perhaps more commonly, containing all the pages for four eight-leaf gatherings, imposed to be perfected end-for-end so that each sheet resulted in two copies of each of the four gatherings). 45 The fact that the number of leaves in a gathering does not in itself reveal the number of pages in the forme (and therefore, given the observed dimensions of the leaves, the size of the sheet) does not, of course, distinguish the task of analyzing machine-press books from that of hand-press ones. The most significant difference is that machine-made paper has fewer readily visible characteristics of potential usefulness, since it generally shows no discernible pattern when held up to the light, and if chainlines and watermarks are present they have no integral connection with the manufacturing process but are simply optional embellishments. 46 It follows that the principal piece of paper evidence available for machine-printed books (and indeed for those earlier ones, largely from the late eighteenth-century, printed on wove, unwatermarked paper) is the leaf-edges of untrimmed or partially untrimmed copies. Even if the outer-edge folds have been slit, those edges can still often be distinguished (by their matching roughness) from the leaf-edges that coincide with the original edges of the sheet (or with the edges of the roll and the machine-cuts across the roll), and the patterns discovered in a study of leaf-edges can sometimes reveal the imposition scheme used. 47 Useful typographical evidence can also at times be uncovered. The fact that in cylinder-press operation the leading edge of a forme receives the most stress and the following (or “trailing”) edge the next most (with the side edges somewhat less and the internal page-edges very little) can enable one by studying plate damage to determine the imposition that would have led to it. 48 And sometimes multi-page resetting to correct damage to the edge of a forme can indicate some of the type-pages that were adjacent. 49 Reappearances of distinctively damaged ornaments or ornamented types can—as in books from earlier periods—help to show which pages could not be on the press at the same time. 50 The rare survival of plate-gang numbers can lead to the determination of imposition schemes; 51 and occasionally in paperback “two-up” printing, if the cutting is not done precisely, one may be able to see on any given page a line or two of text from the page (of another book) imposed above or below it. 52 If, after trying such approaches as these, and others that will inevitably be developed as more investigation is made of nineteenth- and twentieth-century books, one still cannot in a given instance state with confidence the number of type-pages on the press at one time, one must clearly be content to give the structure of a book only in terms of the number of leaves per gathering. As Bowers said in his treatment of format for machine-printed books, “If the format is not known, it is omitted” (p. 429). Although this advice may sound too obvious to require stating, Bowers's purpose in giving it was to emphasize, first, that one should not regard the number of leaves per gathering as an indication of format and, second, that one should not adopt publishers' occasional practice of using format terms as vague indications of size. Since the collation formula makes clear the number of leaves in each gathering, there is no point, as he says, in substituting an expression like “in 8s” or “in 12s” for the format statement; one could, as he suggests (p. 430), give the dimensions of a typical leaf instead, though he rightly adds that this information might just as well be placed in the paragraph on paper. Bowers's handling of this matter is sounder than Gaskell's. In the main treatment of format in the New Introduction, Gaskell wrote: We shall see later that books of the machine-press period were commonly printed from multiple impositions on large sheets of paper which were then cut up for folding into ordinary gatherings. For such books a format statement such as “crown octavo” does not necessarily indicate either the imposition scheme or the size of the large sheets; what it does indicate—properly used—is that the size of the sub-units of the sheets used for the gatherings was crown, and that the sub-units were folded octavo-fashion into gatherings of eight leaves. (pp. 80-81) It is surprising that Gaskell would sanction the use of expressions like “crown octavo” to mean something different for machine-printed books from what they mean when applied to hand-printed books. His suggestion amounts to saying that “format” for machine-printed books refers neither to paper nor type but only to the characteristics of the folded gatherings (leaf size and number of leaves). But such a signification for “format” is precisely what he—like other bibliographers—warns against for hand-printed books. It is not conducive to clarity to allow “format” (or any other term) to shift so drastically in meaning according to the equipment employed to produce the book being described. Besides, not every book produced on a machine-press was printed on large paper: it is perfectly possible for a nineteenth- or twentieth-century book gathered in eight-leaf sections actually to be an octavo in the traditional sense. The concept of format, if it is to be informative rather than confusing, must clearly remain constant as it is applied to books of different periods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">43 See “A Word on Size-Notation” (see note 12 above), p. 36 [406]. He did allude to presswork as well as paper when he said that “the modern methods of making paper and of printing books combine to render any accurate application of form-notation to such books not so much difficult as impossible.” But his statement would not have come to so definite a conclusion if he had recognized the potential usefulness of typographical evidence in determining format (and therefore had more explicitly seen format as reflected in the forme). 44 Presses that were sheet-fed rather than web-fed could also make use of rolled paper, if the rolls were cut into sheets first; and the size of the sheets was of course determined in the same way as if the cutting were done after printing—by the area of printing surface placed on the press. But this situation falls into the same category as that discussed in the preceding section: whether the paper brought to the press was half a double-sized sheet or a segment of a roll does not affect the essential argument. 45 See, for example, Oliver L. Steele, “Half-Sheet Imposition of Eight-Leaf Quires in Formes of Thirty-Two and Sixty-Four Pages,” SB, 15 (1962), 274-278; cf. his “A Note on Half-Sheet Imposition in Nineteenth and Twentieth Century Books,” Gutenberg Jahrbuch, 1962, pp. 545-547. 46 These patterns can still have some usefulness, as in detecting cancel leaves; but no conclusions can be drawn, even tentatively, from the direction of the chainline pattern or the location of the watermarks. 47 For an example of the use of this technique, see Oliver L. Steele, “On the Imposition of the First Edition of Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter, ” Library, 5th ser., 17 (1962), 250-255. 48 See Oliver L. Steele, “Evidence of Plate Damage as Applied to the First Impressions of Ellen Glasgow's The Wheel of Life, ” SB, 16 (1963), 223-231. In the case of text printed from offset plates, slur indicating the trailing edge can sometimes be seen with the help of magnification; see Craig Abbott, “Offset Slur as Bibliographical Evidence,” Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, 70 (1976), 538-541. E. W. Padwick should be given credit for recommending, in an introductory textbook ( Bibliographical Method, 1969), that such techniques as studying plate damage and leaf-edges should be employed in the attempt to determine the format of machine-printed books because format “remains the only real indication of how the book was constructed” (p. 227). 49 As in an instance that I analyzed in the Northwestern-Newberry Edition of Herman Melville's Typee (1968), pp. 310-311. 50 See, for example, Shef Rogers, “How Many Ts Had Ezra Pound's Printer?”, SB, 49 (1996), 277-283. 51 See Matthew J. Bruccoli and C. A. Rheault, “Imposition Figures and Plate Gangs in The Rescue, ” SB, 14 (1961), 258-262. 52 See the very informative article by Thomas L. Bonn, “Two, Two-Up, 32s: A Paperback in the Making,” Journal of the Printing Historical Society, 18 (1984), 36-46; see also Matthew J. Bruccoli, American Notes &amp; Queries, 1 (1962), 6, and G. T.

      <field name="fulltext">IV An excursus on the format of so-called “broadsides” and “broadside books” may be in order here, because the subject has not been treated satisfactorily, either in the introductory textbooks or elsewhere. There has been, for example, some discussion—a disproportionate amount, in my opinion—about whether two terms, “broadside” and “broadsheet,” should be used to distinguish the direction in which the lines of type run, and there has been debate over whether these terms can apply to pieces that have printing on both sides. Even Pollard and Greg felt obliged to comment on such matters, and although they recognized that the direction of the printing is not an aspect of format, they nevertheless suggested the term “oblong broadside” to indicate “the broadsheet in which the lines of type follow the wiremarks and not the chainmarks.” 53 The direction in which the lines of type run, and the question whether the printing appears on one or both sides of the paper, are obviously matters irrelevant to a consideration of format. If one wishes to have terms that will make such distinctions, one is concerned with defining different genres of printed matter, not formats. But determining the fraction of a full sheet that a given item occupies is indeed a format question, and here too a failure to distinguish formats from kinds of printed matter has vitiated some of the commentary. The word “broadside” is popularly used to mean any printed piece of paper—such as a poster, a handbill, and the like—intended for distribution in that form, not as part of a book. But since some of these printed pieces of paper are whole sheets and some part-sheets, this use of “broadside” is not a format term. If one wants it to be a format term (probably not a good idea, as I suggest below), one would have to use it consistently with the other format terms, from “folio” onward. Such consistency would demand that “broadside” refer only to the situation in which one type-page (or other unit of printing surface) is on the press and is intended to fill one side of a whole sheet of paper. In other words, the verbal or visual text—whether it is presented in one or more columns and whether the longer or shorter dimension of the paper is at the top—constitutes the matter for a page, which by definition is one side of a leaf. Thus in this format the leaf is a whole sheet, and the format symbol would logically be 1°. 54 But when, as often happened, the type for two separate single-leaf pieces—two handbills, for example—was on the press at one time, the resulting printed items, after the sheets were cut, ought logically to be called folio leaves. Otherwise one would be in the position of treating a half-sheet handbill differently from a single-leaf cancel (or a single-leaf insertion) in a folio book. Many bibliographers have been in this position, however, ( Principles, p. 195) and Gaskell ( New Introduction, p. 81) recommended “½°” as the format notation for a separate half-sheet piece (whereas a leaf to be inserted in a folio book would be a “2° leaf”). The “½°” notation is as illogical as the earlier practice, condemned by all thoughtful bibliographers, of using “single sheet” to mean “half a broadside.” 55 Notations like “½°,” “¼°,” and “⅛°” are inconsistent with the standard forms “2°,” “4°,” and “8°”—or, rather, one should perhaps say that they actually constitute an alternative system for saying the same thing. Both “2°” and “½°” mean that each leaf is half a sheet, though by custom the numerator of the fraction is omitted. The act of inserting it does not logically tell one that the item consists of only one leaf, for the number of leaves involved has nothing to do with the format designation. A folio pamphlet of four leaves and a folio book of one hundred leaves are equally of folio format, and a half-sheet handbill—a one-leaf item—is also in folio format. It could be recorded as “2°: 1 leaf,” which would be consistent with established format usage; or, more conveniently perhaps, it could be called a “folio leaf,” a “2° leaf,” or a “half-sheet leaf.” (The leaves of loose-leaf manuscripts may similarly be called “folio leaves” or “half-sheet leaves,” and so on, though the size of full sheets may not always be ascertainable, especially if the paper is not handmade.) To be realistic, one cannot stop the widespread use of “broadside” as the generic term covering nearly any kind of single-leaf printed item, including such part-sheet pieces. I think bibliographers might therefore consider not using it as a format term and using it instead in this general sense (since it is convenient anyway to have some term to cover all such loose pieces). Then it would be possible to refer to “full-sheet broadsides,” “folio broadsides,” “quarto broadsides,” and so on. “Broadside” would then be a term parallel with “book” or “pamphlet,” distinguishing loose single printed leaves from multi-leaf assemblages, and the conventional format terms can be applied to the former as readily as the latter. By “multi-leaf assemblages,” I of course refer both to books constructed from gatherings sewn through the gutter-folds and to books made up of disjunct leaves held together by stabbing or oversewing, by sewing through folds created by turned-over edges, or by pasting to sewn stubs. 56 Many books constructed of disjunct leaves exist, often consisting of engraved or lithographed plates, such as books of music, maps, or botanical, zoological, or topographical illustrations. 57 Any consideration of broadsides must take up these books since their structure might cause one to think of them as collections of broadsides. They are indeed sometimes called “broadside books” (or “broadsheet books”); but if (as I think desirable) we wish to restrict “broadside” to single-leaf pieces, we cannot speak of a “broadside book” except perhaps in those instances where the book is in fact made up of single-leaf pieces that had been published and distributed separately. Another name is thus needed for books that contain works requiring more than one leaf for their presentation and that are made up of disjunct leaves. They cannot be called “leaf books” because that term already has an established meaning, referring to the unfortunate category of book in which each copy of an edition contains (tipped or laid into it) a leaf from an earlier book. What I suggest, therefore, is “disjunct-leaf book” or, perhaps more euphoniously but less obviously, “singleton book.” 58 These terms carry no implication that the leaves are necessarily whole sheets, and they can be used for all books (manuscript or printed) made up of disjunct leaves, regardless of their formats. It has not been common to speak of formats in connection with disjunct-leaf books, but clearly they do have formats, determined exactly as for conjugate-leaf books, by the portion of a full sheet occupied by each leaf and thus by the number of page-units of printing surface required to fill one side of a sheet. 59 Once one learns to think of format in terms of how many page-units are required to fill a whole sheet, not in terms of paper-folding, one sees immediately that conjugacy is not an essential aspect of format. For present purposes, we need not debate whether “codex” can be applied to disjunct-leaf books as well as to conjugate-leaf books. 60 There seems little doubt that the conjugate-leaf codex evolved from the practice of fastening wooden tablets with thongs running through holes along one side; and in any case both structures share the principal characteristic that is usually thought to distinguish the codex from the roll—the division of the reading surface into leaves held together at one edge. Disjunct-leaf books (not only plate books but modern paperbacks as well) sit on library shelves along with conjugate- leaf books, and bibliographers often have to describe them in the same bibliographies. The concept of and the notation for format ought to be the same in both cases, since the manner in which leaves are held together is not the determinant of format. Allan Stevenson, when he faced the task of describing the eighteenth-century books in the Hunt collection, recognized the need for a standard system for dealing with what he called “broadsheet books,” since many of them were naturally present in a collection of botanical books. His proposal (in his introduction to the 1961 volume of the Hunt catalogue [see note 24 above]) left something to be desired, however, for he recommended using a superscript “1” in the collation formulas for such books, as in “A-N 1 .” He said, “This is almost the only situation in which, there being no folding of the sheet, we use odd numbers as indexes” (p. clx). But this point is an admission that disjunct-leaf books are not being treated uniformly with conjugate-leaf books. There is, after all, an established form for reporting individual leaves: the numeral is placed on the line, as in “A1.” The description of disjunct-leaf books provides no reason to relax the rule of restricting superscript figures to sewing-fold conjugacies, and thus to even numbers. In speaking of the notation for referring, outside the formula, to individual leaves of disjunct-leaf books, Stevenson suggested using only the signatures—that is, “A” rather than “A1”—because he felt that the numeral was superfluous in such cases. He seemed not to realize the inconsistency he was left with, since the superscript “1” in the formula was equally unnecessary: there is no ambiguity in stating “1°: A-N.” There would be an ambiguity (or at least potential confusion), however, if the leaves were part-sheets and the format figure were therefore something other than “1°.” 61 A system for treating disjunct-leaf books uniformly with conjugate-leaf books requires that provision be made for books consisting of disjunct leaves that are each less than a full sheet (a situation that Stevenson does not cover). In fact, a ready-made system already exists: the standard plan for recording the collation of conjugate-leaf books requires no adjustment to handle disjunct-leaf books, except recognizing the use of a dash to link references to single leaves, in the same way that signatures are linked in conventional formulas to signify a series between the first and last one named. Thus a book made up of half-sheet disjunct leaves would be described as follows (the first line referring to one with signed leaves, the second to one with unsigned leaves, the third to one with both): 2°: A1-T1 2°: [1 1 -19 1 ] or 2°: 19 disjunct leaves 2°: A1-D1 χ1 E1-L1 [M1] N1-S1 If each leaf were a quarter-sheet, the format would be 4°, and so on. Anyone familiar with the established system would have no doubt about what is being recorded here and would be able to adapt this plan to other complications. 62 I wish to emphasize that these formulas should not be thought of as an innovation. They simply emerge logically from coherent thinking about format. If format is taken to refer to the number of page-units needed to fill one side of a sheet, it follows that a disjunct leaf and a conjugate leaf are the same format if they both consist of the same fraction of a sheet. This point has always been understood when a few disjunct leaves are tipped into a book largely constructed of folded gatherings, but it should apply equally to a book made up entirely of disjunct leaves. Eliminating the idea of folding as an element of format makes clear that the essential concept comprehends without difficulty both broadsides and disjunct-leaf books as well as books made up of sewn gatherings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">53 That is, of course, when a full sheet is used. See Alfred W. Pollard and W. W. Greg, “Some Points in Bibliographical Descriptions,” Transaction of the Bibliographical Society, 9 (1906-8), 31-52 (see “Broadsides and Folio Sheets,” pp. 39-40); reprinted in Alfred William Pollard: A Selection of His Essay, ed. Fred W. Roper (1976), pp. 116-129 (pp. 123- 124). Cf. McKerrow's Introduction, p. 30, n. 1. 54 W. W. Greg, in the “Provisional Memoranda” prefaced to the first volume (1939) of his Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration, specified “`1°' to indicate unfolded sheets” (p. xvi). Later, in the full introduction placed in the fourth volume (1959), he reaffirmed his use of “1° for a book consisting of unfolded sheets, for which there is no recognized term” (p. lv). 55 Yet tradition dies hard: J. D. Cowley's Bibliographical Description and Cataloguing (1949) recognized that the usage was “quite illogical” (p. 94) but nevertheless recommended “S.s.” (standing for “Single sheet”) to refer to “half a sheet with letterpress parallel with shorter sides” (p. 208). 56 The creation of bifolia by pasting one printed item to the turned- over edge of another should be distinguished from the pasting together of two pieces of paper before printing: in the former instance, format is determined by the portion of a full sheet occupied by each of the disjunct leaves; in the latter, format is based on the full sheets created by the pasting (see the discussion to which note 38 above is attached). On the use of a full set of sewn stubs, to which all leaves are attached, see note 62 below. But if all the disjunct leaves to be held together are given folds near the gutter edge, a collection of disjunct leaves can be secured by sewing through those folds without the need of pasting; and the format would of course be the same as if the leaves had been pasted to turned-over edges or stabbed through. (The insertion of cancels in incunables by turned-over edges is discussed by Martin Boghardt in “Blattersetzung und Neusatz in frühen Inkunabeln,” Bibliothek und Wissenschaft, 29 (1996), 24-58 [see especially the diagrams in section 3, pp. 28-39].) 57 Another large category of disjunct-leaf books consists of most twentieth-century paperbacks. Unlike many disjunct-leaf books made up of engraved or lithographed plates, however, their leaves were not printed individually. The collation formulas for such books offer no more problems than do those of any other disjunct-leaf books; but the format designations pose all the difficulties associated with other machine-printed books. If the techniques suggested earlier for determining format for these books, such as the identification of offset-slur, do not prove conclusive, one is forced to leave out any format designation. (Sometimes one finds such revealing errors as the one I found in a copy of the second 1972 printing of the Penguin edition of Great Expectations, where pages 321 through 368 are missing—this gap suggesting gatherings of twenty-four leaves. But of course even this information does not in itself tell one the number of pages in a forme, and the same could be said of a section of leaves on different paper.) 58 One could use these terms even if a book also contained some gatherings of conjugate leaves, as long as the bulk of the book consisted of disjunct leaves—just as the presence of a few tipped-in engraved plates in a book otherwise made up of folded letterpress gatherings does not affect what one calls the book as a whole. 59 Not necessarily type-pages, since disjunct-leaf books are more likely to have been printed from engraved or lithographic surfaces. 60 In Colin H. Roberts and T. C. Skeat's The Birth of the Codex (1983), the codex form is defined as “a collection of sheets of any material, folded double and fastened together at the back or spine, and usually protected by covers” (p. 1). But they state, in discussing ancient waxed writing tablets, “The correct designation in Latin for a plurality of tablets or for multi-leaved tablets was codex ” (p. 12). 61 One could of course make a rule that the absence of superscript figures means that the leaves are disjunct. But such a practice would not avoid ambiguity in the signature-notation system as a whole, since a signature letter (or number) would then refer sometimes to a gathering and sometimes to a single leaf. 62 Such as books that consist of a combination of letterpress and engraved leaves. If the letterpress consists primarily of disjunct unsigned or unnumbered leaves, one could follow Stevenson's suggestions for what he called “lambda books” (pp. clx-clxi) and combine the Greek letter lambda with a plate number to designate the leaf of letterpress that is associated with a given plate. In the case of plate-books where the plates are interspersed within folded letterpress gatherings, one may follow Stevenson's principle of recording the letterpress and the disjunct plates separately (p. clxix) and my more detailed suggestion for implementing this idea by employing two linked collations, each of which can be preceded by its own format designation (see pp. 39-40 of “The Description of Non-Letterpress Material in Books,” SB, 35 [1982], 1-42). (The linking consists of placing in the plate formula parenthetical page references—using signature notation keyed to the other formula—that indicate which page is faced by each plate.) Another situation that may be treated in analogous fashion occurs in the kind of book in which the plates are attached to gathered and sewn conjugate stubs (in effect, a book in which all leaves are cancels): one collation formula would record the structure of the gathered stubs, another the sequence of the plates. (The links from the latter formula to the former would consist of parenthetical leaf references preceded by “±”.) On the sewing of disjunct leaves through folds created by turned-over edges, see note 56 above; this situation would not be reflected in the formula (just as stabbing or the spine-gluing of so-called “perfect bindings”—or the manner of securing cancels, for that matter—would not be), but the means of fastening should be described in words.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V If the complications in defining format were limited to those so far discussed—primarily created by double, quad, rolled, and cut-down paper, by paper from two-sheet moulds, and by broadsides and disjunct-leaf books—there would be little more to say beyond recognizing that type-formes must be given a greater role in the definition than they traditionally have been. But there is another situation that has to be accommodated, one that to some extent throws the emphasis back on the paper: when the type placed on the press is less than the amount required for one side of a sheet of paper of the size selected for a particular job. Although a printer of any period could naturally choose to operate this way on certain occasions, bibliographers are not likely to encounter the practice very often except when they are dealing with books from the earliest years of printing. Before the early 1470s printers regularly printed one page at a time, and only one type-page was on the press at a time. 63 The fact that printers in the 1450s and 1460s printed one page at a time has been recognized by incunabulists since the days of Bradshaw and Blades; 64 and McKerrow in his 1927 Introduction discussed the matter as a well-known, if not always clearly analyzed, phenomenon (pp. 57-61), regarding it as “certain” that “some at least of the earliest books were printed one page at a time” (p. 60). By the late twen- tieth century, Paul Needham was able to say, “One of our surest items of knowledge with regard to the earliest European printing is that in the first two decades all printing was done one page at a time, and not in imposed formes” (“Res papirea” [see note 4 above], p. 128). Under these circumstances, format for printed books of this period obviously cannot be defined in terms of the number of type-pages on the press. When four type-pages were required to fill one side of a sheet, the format has to be called quarto, even though no forme of four type-pages was ever placed on the press. The difficulty for bibliographers arises from an associated practice of the early printers: cutting sheets for quartos and octavos before printing. Thus a quarto would be printed one page at a time on half-sheets, each accommodating two pages per side. The type-pages that were printed on each half-sheet were often chosen (one cannot say “imposed”) so as to allow for the quiring of four or five half-sheets, producing gatherings made up of two or two and a half whole sheets. 65 This result does not in itself pose any greater problems for bibliographers who wish to designate format than the common later situation in which two or more sheets printed from imposed formes were quired together. But it does reinforce a principle suggested above in connection with the turned chainlines in sixteenth-, seventeenth-, and eighteenth-century books: that, when paper is cut before printing, the original size is relevant to format only in those instances where the cutting is equivalent to folding after printing. In the case of unusually large sheets, for example, the fact that what went on the press was only part of the sheet as manufactured does not affect the designation of format because the function of the cutting was to create a new size of sheet; the format is therefore indicated by the number of pages needed to fill each side of those new sheets, or in other words by the number of imposed type-pages. 66 Or when sheets of a normal size were altered to create a supply of the smaller paper needed for a given job, the cutting was not the equivalent of folding after printing, and again here it is the number of pages required to fill one side of the cut sheets that determines format. In the case of half-sheet pieces of paper placed on the press in early printing, on the other hand, the decisive factor is not how many type-pages it would take to print one side of each half-sheet, since here the cutting of the sheets before printing was the equivalent of folding after printing. The sheets were cut only to simplify the process of printing from formes that contained fewer type-pages than the number needed for one side of a sheet of the selected size (or, to speak casually, “partial formes”); and the end result was the same as if uncut sheets had been printed from fully imposed formes, and then cut. (The result was the same, that is, except for some tell-tale clues, such as the distribution of watermarks and of mould and felt sides: when half-sheets are used, some copies are likely to display more or fewer watermarks per gathering than would be possible if the sheets had not been slit until after folding, or patterns of mould and felt sides that could not occur if whole sheets had been placed on the press.) In this situation, there was neither a full sheet (as defined for the job) nor a full forme (the amount of printing surface that would fill one side of such a sheet) on the press; but there was nevertheless a key to format in the fact that the cutting of the sheet was the equivalent of folding, and therefore the number of pages that would fit on one side of a full sheet is the relevant figure. This principle applies even if the number of type-pages on the press, instead of being only one, were the number required to fill one side of the part-sheet placed on the press—if, for example, a quarto were printed on half-sheets with two type-pages on the press at a time. A few bibliographers have postulated that such two-page formes were standard in the early decades of printing, 67 but that contention can readily be disproved by studying the type-indentations in the printed paper (noting, that is, that the same side of the piece of paper displays both first-side and secondside printing). 68 Nevertheless, printing by two-page formes was possible as long as the coffin of the press would accommodate them, and for some printers this practice 69 may well have characterized a transition phase between single- page printing and the full-forme printing that was to become the norm. (The term “full-forme,” as I suggested above, is short-hand for “full-sheet-forme,” meaning a forme that would fully print one side of a sheet of the chosen size.) The size of the platen relative to the size of the coffin (that is, to the type-area that the coffin would hold) is not in itself relevant to this question, though confusion on this point has weakened some analyses. Lotte Hellinga, for instance, in her study of the origins of full-forme printing, remarks on “the distinction between half-sheets and full sheets, and therefore the use of the one-pull and the two-pull press.” 70 But the size of the paper laid on the press is not limited by the number of type-pages in the coffin, for the paper could be large enough to accommodate more type-pages than those on the press at one time—or than the total that the coffin would hold, in cases where the frisket was not affixed to the tympan, or the tympan to the coffin. 71 And the number of type-pages placed on the press at one time need not be enough to fill the coffin. If one wishes to use the phrases “one-pull press” and “two-pull press,” all they can mean is that in the first the coffin is the same size as the platen, and in the second the coffin is double the size of the platen. But in either case one could lay on the press fewer type-pages than the number required to fill the coffin, just as the pieces of paper employed would not have to match the area of printing surface on the press. Whether in a given instance, therefore, it took one or two pulls to print one side of a piece of paper (a sheet or a part-sheet) does not necessarily correlate with whether the press itself was a “one- pull press” or a “two-pull press.” 72 The design of the press is of course an interesting historical matter; but the size of the platen relative to that of the coffin is not often a fact that can enter very helpfully into bibliographical analysis, unlike the determination of which pages were on the press at one time. The important point for a discussion of format is that if four type-pages (and the spaces surrounding them) fill the area on one side of a sheet of paper of a chosen size, the format is quarto even if only one or two type-pages were on the press at one time and even if the paper was cut in half before printing. It would be wrong to regard a book produced in this fashion as a folio simply because two type-pages were on the press and they were sufficient to fill one side of each of the pieces of paper placed on the press: clearly those production techniques were only expedients for creating as the end- product a group of books with the same shape, size, and structure as would have obtained if the full sheets had been printed from four-page formes. The resulting chainline direction and watermark position will be those that ordinarily characterize quartos, if the paper was made in the usual way; but that fact cannot be the primary reason for defining this format as quarto, since as we have seen these features are not infallible guides. The various theoretical possibilities for imposition and for papercutting that one may imagine have probably been actually employed at one time or another. For example, Dennis E. Rhodes once concluded (on the basis of the distribution of textual variants and watermarks) that the 1479 Oxford edition of Aristotle's Ethics —a “small quarto”— was printed in formes of two pages but that some sheets were cut in half before printing and others were not (the latter would therefore have been placed on the press twice for the printing of each side). 73 I have not examined Rhodes's evidence because the question at present is not whether his conclusions were correct but what implications the situation would have for the concept of format. If one accepts the treatment of single-page printing and of two-page formes suggested above, then the use of both cut and uncut sheets would have no effect on the designation of format. In the instances discussed above, the printing of half-sheets one or two pages at a time 74 produced quarto format not because the sheets were cut but because the total number of pages planned for each side of the full sheets was four. Thus whether or not the sheets were cut before printing (like the question of how many type-pages were on the press at one time) is unrelated to the fact that the area contained on each side of a full sheet held four pages—and that fact is what determines format. If Rhodes is right about the Aristotle, then the entire book is a quarto; the book is not made up of two formats even though the pieces of paper placed on the press to print it were of two different sizes. This observation leads naturally to the question whether it is ever appropriate to regard a single book as made up of sheets in more than one format. The answer was easy with the Aristotle since the paper was all the same (the original sheets were all the same size, that is; whether the paper was all of the same stock is not relevant for this particular point). And whether it was cut before printing or after binding did not affect the number of pages printed on each side of the whole sheet. But what about books printed on papers that were originally of different sizes but were cut into appropriately sized pieces for placement on the press? If, for instance, half-sheets of one size contained about the same area as whole sheets of a smaller size, the two could readily be (and commonly were) mixed in the printing of a single book. 75 And if both the whole sheets and the half-sheets were printed two pages to a side, would the book as a whole have to be considered a mixture of folio and quarto? The question has nothing to do with how many type-pages were on the press at one time 76 or whether the larger paper was cut before printing; the sole consideration is that it takes two type-pages (of the uniform size established for the book in question) to fill one side of a sheet of the smaller paper and four to fill one side of a sheet of the larger paper. Situations of this kind usually reveal themselves by a mixture of chainline directions and of watermark positions, and incunabulists have regularly described such books as “2° and 4°” (or, obviously, as “4° and 8°” when the number of type-pages per side is doubled). 77 Such paired format designations are in line with the approach to format I have been outlining, in which the essential fact is the number of type-pages (and/or blank pages, of course) that are needed to fill one side of a standard sheet. Some people, however, may feel that it is awkward to have to refer to a single book, with all its leaves of uniform size, as comprising two formats. Their argument might be that the mixture of papers is simply a detail of production history that need not be reflected in the term we use for the finished product. They could say that their approach is not inconsistent with what I have argued: if cut halves are treated as whole sheets when determining the format of some sixteenth- and seventeenth-century plays, or of those seventeenth- and eighteenth-century items printed on paper cut from extra-large sheets, why cannot one say, in the situation postulated here, that sheets were cut in half only to create pieces of paper that were compatible with smallersized whole sheets—and thus call the book simply a folio? There are several objections to this reasoning. First, the larger sheets need not be cut before printing even if only half (or fewer) of the type-pages for one side of each sheet are on the press at one time. To make the timing of the cutting a determinant of format in these cases would be to give two names to the same result. Second, the extra-large sheets of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were made with the understanding that each would form two normal full-sized sheets, just as much as when the papermaker created the division with a deckle; but when ordinary sheets were cut before printing, the cut pieces can be treated as full sheets only when the cuts do not serve as the equivalent of folds after printing. 78 There is a distinction to be made, for example, between (1) cutting sheets in order to make them the proper size for printing plays in standard fashion from four-page formes and (2) cutting sheets as an expedient for printing four-page sides from formes of one or two pages. The former creates a new size of sheet; the latter only produces half-sheets. Third, if one does not make this distinction in the case of early books printed from “partial formes,” those examples containing paper stocks that were originally of two sizes would have to take their format name from the full sheets, since one would be assuming that the larger paper was cut in half only to make it the size of the smaller full sheets. The full sheets might, however, be the minority paper in the book, and one could equally well argue that they were used as a convenient supplement to the dominant paper, since they were the same size as half-sheets of it. Or, of course, the two papers could be fairly evenly mixed, in which case it would seem still more arbitrary to choose one as the determinant of format. Fourth, the whole idea that a single book must be called by a single format name is reminiscent of the vague use of “format” to refer to shape and size. If format designations are to signify something precise about the relation of process and product, I see no alternative to classifying certain books as being of two formats. 79 The routines of the earliest printers can be consistently and systematically accommodated to the same concept of format appropriate for later books, as long as one focuses strictly on the number of type-pages (and/or blank pages) used to fill one side of a full sheet, recognizing that any cutting before printing was only the equivalent of folding after printing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">63 Printing one page “at a time” could mean two different things: either that only one type-page was on the press, or that more than one were on the press but that each pull of the bar to lower the platen printed only one of them (and the coffin was cranked to a different position between pulls). Since the number of type-pages on the press is more significant for bibliographical analysis than the number of pulls required to print them, whenever I speak of printing some number of type-pages “at a time,” I am referring to the number on the press at the same time. 64 In 1863 (in the second volume of The Life and Typography of William Caxton ), Blades stated that “only a page at a time was worked in the earlier part of Caxton's career” (p. xlvii). 65 It should be noted that the arrangement of type-pages for printing on precut half-sheets is a very different matter from the later procedure called “half- sheet imposition.” Such imposition involved printing on whole sheets but with the type- pages imposed so that each sheet could later be cut to form either two separate half-sheet gatherings (“two half-sheets worked together”) or two copies of the same half-sheet text (half-sheets produced by “work-and-turn”). See Kenneth Povey, “On the Diagnosis of Half-Sheet Impositions,” Library, 5th ser., 11 (1956), 268-272. 66 When I speak of “imposed type-pages,” here and elsewhere, I include of course any blank pages, made up of furniture or bearers, that were a part of a complete imposed forme in a given instance. 67 See, for example, Jeanne Veyrin-Forrer's discussion of “livres de format in-quarto... imposées par deux pages comme des in-folio,” as reprinted in her La lettre et le texte (1987), p. 200. Lotte Hellinga, in the article cited in note 70 below, regards Veyrin-Forrer's results as “final.” 68 This technique has been used by incunabulists since at least 1900, when Heinrich Wallau explained it in “Die zweifarbigen Initialen der Psalterdrucke von Johann Fust und Peter Schöffer,” in Festschrift sum fünfhundertjährigen Geburtstage von Johann Gutenberg (1900), pp. 261-304 (see p. 280). An example of a more recent use of this test is Paul Needham's report on Conrad Braem's first two books, in Appendix I (p. 18) of “Fragments of an Unrecorded Edition of the First Alost Press,” Quaerendo, 12 (1982), 6-21. 69 Or the use of four-page formes for printing an octavo on half- sheets. Ursula Baurmeister reported such an instance from 1471 in “Clement de Padoue, enlumineur et premier imprimeur italien?”, Bulletin de bibliophile, 1990, 1:19-28 (see pp. 23-24). 70 “Press and Text in the First Decades of Printing,” in Libri, tipografi, biblioteche: ricerche storiche dedicate a Luigi Balsamo, ed. A. Ganda and E. Grignani (1997), pp. 1-23 (quotation from p. 5). The same misconception underlies various other statements, such as her assertion that the use of a two-pull press would “require” setting by formes from cast-off copy (p. 4), as if printing could not take place with fewer type-pages than the maximum number that the press would hold (there is of course the further assumption that there was never enough type to set full formes in page-number order). It is curious that Hellinga does not take advantage of the indentation test for determining single-page printing and that in a footnote she exaggerates the difficulty of using it (p. 5). She seems to give greater weight to the use of marked printer's copy (which of course is not usually available), as when she says, “It is particularly difficult to establish this [whether full formes were used] beyond doubt in editions in-folio, unless printer's copy survives to enlighten us about the procedure used” (p. 5). Printer's copy, however, is not primary evidence (cast-off copy does not prove setting by formes), whereas type-indentations do reveal what actually happened. 71 For some comments on the use of an unattached tympan (a “removable frame” as Martin Boghardt's translator calls it), see Boghardt's “Pinhole Patterns in Large-Format Incunabula,” Library, 7th ser., 1 (200), 263-289 (esp. pp. 267, 269, 278); this article is a revision and translation (by John L. Flood) of “Punkturmuster in grossformatigen Inkunabeln und die Datierung des Mainzer Catholicon, ” Gutenberg Jahrbuch, 1999, pp. 75-88. 72 Hellinga's assumption of such a correlation, combined with her focus on quartos, leads to awkwardness in her argument. For example, she says that when we can show a given quarto to have been printed on full sheets, “we can be certain that the printer had a press which could accommodate at least a forme corresponding to a whole sheet of the smallest and most commonly used size of paper... or to a whole sheet of one of the larger sizes” (p. 2). But two pages later she alludes to “the printer producing a folio edition, printing a page at a time on a one-pull press” (p. 4)—a situation in which uncut sheets were used on a press that could not accommodate a full-sheet forme of the size needed for those sheets. One is left to wonder why a quarto could not have been printed the same way. 73 “Variants in the 1479 Oxford Edition of Aristotle's Ethics,” SB, 8 (1956), 209-212. 74 As I hope is clear from the previous discussion, “at a time” here has nothing to do with how many pulls of the platen were needed but only with the number of type-pages on the press at the same time. 75 Paul Needham has discussed this situation in “Aldus Mantius's Paper Stocks” (see note 6 above), pp. 291-292. 76 One or two—or even four, in which case, when the smaller paper was used, two sheets would have had to be laid on the press at the same time. This theoretical possibility was mentioned by Curt F. Bühler in “Caxton Studies,” Gutenberg Jahrbuch, 1940, pp. 169-176 (reprinted, with a revised diagram, in his Early Books and Manuscripts [1973], pp. 43-52): “the printer would have been able to print four pages with two pulls of the lever; in short, he would be printing `in quarto' but with two sheets of folio paper” (p. 176; p. 51 later). Instead of saying “two sheets of folio paper,” he should have said “two sheets printed as folios” (because two type-pages filled one side of each), and the format would therefore simply be folio, regardless of the fact that four type-pages were on the press. It is misleading to speak here of printing “in quarto.” On the other hand, if the two sheets had been pasted together to create a larger sheet—as in the case of the Foxe book cited above (see note 38)—the format would be quarto. 77 See, for example, Paul Needham's description of a 1480 Venetian Bible in the 1989 Sotheby catalogue of The George Abrams Collection (lot 27). 78 The cuts need not create two equal pieces: in McKerrow's illustration quoted earlier, for example, the printer needed pieces of paper that were ⅔ the size of the original sheets. The goal here was to create a new size of sheet; the cut was therefore not the equivalent of a fold after printing, and format would relate to the cut sheet. 79 When this is done, it is of course also necessary to specify in some way which gatherings are in each of the formats. One could, for example, attach the relevant signatures to each format designation—as in “4° (A-G, L-M) and 2° (H-K, N)”—or (if collation formulas are to accompany the format designations) one could use two separate formulas (perhaps placing dashes in each one to show the points at which the sequence moves to the other).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI The issues raised by early books bring to the fore a more basic question that underlies any attempt to conceptualize format: just how much of the production process should be entailed in the naming of formats? Clearly format is a property of books that is determined through analysis, not straightforward description. At least, that much is certain as long as we agree that format does not merely mean the leaf dimensions of a book. If format is taken to express a relation between book production and book structure, it relies on analysis, even in the simplest cases. A book that appears “obviously” to be a folio—because it seems to be like other books known to be folios—is not in fact obviously so until it has been subjected to careful examination. Such analysis may reveal, as we have seen, that chainline direction and watermark position are not always reliable guides. We may learn, among other things, that the paper was cut before printing or that the printing proceeded one page at a time or by “partial formes.” We may also learn which of the alternative imposition schemes for certain formats was used (including half-sheet imposition). All such discoveries are important facts about the printing history of a book, but how many of them are essential elements in designating the format of the book? Is the format of a book printed on full sheets from four-page formes to be stated differently from that of a book printed on half-sheets from two-page formes? Does format, in other words, encapsulate all that can be learned about the imposition, paper, and presswork for a given book, or does it have a more restricted meaning? In thinking about such questions, people sometimes have a tendency to attempt to distinguish printers' concepts from bibliographers' concepts. Curt F. Bühler, for instance, in a rather unsuccessful study of what he called “mixed foldings” (gatherings with uniform leaf dimensions, constructed from sheets that were originally of different sizes) concluded that “any large-sized quarto could actually be a folio, when considered from the printer's point of view as opposed to the bibliographer's.” 80 He was referring to his point that “quarto sheets can be used for printing by `folio-imposition.'” There is no such thing as “quarto sheets,” of course, but rather sheets (of any size) that have four pages occupying each side (and his comment need not be limited to “large-sized” quartos); what he was trying to say is that such sheets can be produced by printing two pages at a time instead of four and that in such a case the result would be a folio to the printer but a quarto to the bibliographer. 81 At the end of his article, he reiterated that “`format' for the fifteenth-century printer occasionally represented something quite different from what it does to the twentieth-century bibliographer” (p. 145). I do not think it profitable to make such a distinction. Format, to be sure, is a concept of bibliographical (that is, historical) analysis, but its whole point is to refer with clarity to something that actually happened in the past; and whether or not anyone in the past defined “format” as we may choose to do (or used the term at all) is not a significant matter. The aim is to understand what happened in the past and to convey that information clearly. A fifteenth-century printer knew how many pages he had on the press at one time and knew how many such pages it would take to fill one side of a whole sheet of the paper he was using. If he printed half-sheets from two-page formes, he obviously understood the difference between that and the use of those formes to print smaller whole sheets. Whether he thought of the one or the other—or neither—as “folio printing” is unimportant. He understood the situation in exactly the same way as the present-day bibliographer does, and it is utterly pointless to insist that the printer somehow saw things differently from the way the bibliographer now sees them. If that were indeed true, it would simply mean that the bibliographer had failed as a historian. The reason for constructing an analytical concept like format is to provide assistance in reporting what the printer did, and knew he was doing. That said, the question still remains: how much of the historical situation do we find it convenient to include within the concept of format? Bühler, for example, cites with implicit approval Greg's formulation of “(2°-form) 4°” for a situation in which a two-page forme prints a half-sheet. (Greg was of course dealing with a situation that was only superficially the same as the one Bühler was confronting.) Is a “(2°- form) 4°” (in Bühler's usage) a different format from a “4°”? I think not: both are quartos and can be referred to as such with no loss of accuracy. The addition of “(2°-form)” tells one something more about the printing process, not about the format. And one could add still more: since a “(2°-form) 4°” need not have been printed on cut sheets, an indication of whether or not they were cut before printing (if that fact can be established) could be inserted into the expression. The result would simply pack more information into a compressed phrase, and whether to do it is therefore a rhetorical decision, not one that alters in any way the concept of format. Other terms, especially those designating paper sizes, have of course in the past regularly been added to format-indicators, as in phrases like “Crown 4°.” But “Crown” merely gives further information about what happened in the printing shop; it should not, I believe, be regarded as part of the format itself (a “Crown 4°” and an “Imperial 4°” are the same format). Another kind of information that has occasionally been attached to format terms is an indication of the precise imposition scheme: thus one could say “common 8°” and “inverted 8°,” “common 12°” and “long 12°,” or “ordinary 4°” and “4° imposed for half-sheet imposition by work-and-turn.” Again, I suggest, the first two are equally octavos, the next two equally duodecimos, and the last two equally quartos. 82 One implication of this point is worth noting here: if differing imposition schemes for the same number of type-pages do not produce different formats, then neither do differing patterns of conjugacies, which are a by-product of the imposition schemes. Conjugacies—the physical joinings of leaves at folds—can occur at any leaf-edge: there are the gutter conjugacies, which result from all impositions (except, obviously, those for broadsides and disjunct-leaf books) and which indeed must exist if gathered sheets are to be held together by sewing through folds; and there are the conjugacies of the other edges of leaves (conjugacies at fore-edges are sometimes called “bolts”), which join certain leaves in all folded gatherings except those in folio (and which are often obliterated by binders' trimming or readers' slitting). All conjugacies are aspects of book-structure, but only sewing-fold conjugacies—which are ultimately of greater structural function—have regularly been reported by bibliographers, in their collation formulas; those conjugacies of course do have a relationship to format in that the number of such conjugate pairs of leaves making up a full sheet is always half the number embedded in the format names (one for folio, two for quarto, four for octavo, and so on). One could also work out relationships between formats and outer-edge conjugacies, such as the fact that the number of upper-edge conjugacies resulting from ordinary quarto imposition is two per sheet. 83 The pattern of these conjugacies (how many pairs of leaves joined at the gutter-fold are combined by a single act of sewing, for example, or how many fore-edge conjugacies occur consecutively) is not, however, an attribute of format—a point already implicit in the idea that format terms do not in themselves indicate the number of leaves per gathering. A folio in sixes (in which the gatherings are quires of three sheets) entails a different imposition scheme—a different ordering of type-pages—from a folio in single-sheet gatherings, and it has a different pattern of sewing-fold conjugacies; and a duodecimo with gatherings of twelve leaves involves a different imposition scheme from a duodecimo in alternating gatherings of eight and four leaves, and it displays a different pattern not only of sewing-fold conjugacies but of outer-edge conjugacies as well. In other words, format—as I am defining it here—refers only to the number of page-units required for one side of a full sheet, not to their precise arrangement. One may properly use phrases that combine format names with the word “imposition,” such as “folio imposition,” but such phrases only identify the number of pages on each side of a sheet, not the particular pages. There is, for example, no one folio imposition but several different folio impositions—such as the second and third pages of a gathering (the imposition for the inner forme of a sheet designed for single-sheet gatherings) or the second and eleventh pages of a gathering (the imposition for the inner forme of a sheet designed to be the outer sheet of a folio-in-sixes gathering). 84 Restricting format to the number of pages, regardless of their arrangement, gives it a usefully discrete function in bibliographical analysis, one that it could not have if it were encumbered by other details of the printing process. All these considerations lead me to propose the following formal definition: Format is a designation of the number of page-units (whether of printing surface, handwritten text, or blank space) that the producers of a printed or manuscript item decided upon to fill each side of a sheet of paper or vellum of the selected size(s); if paper came to a printing press in rolls rather than sheets, format can only refer to the number of page-units placed on the press at one time for the purpose of printing one side of the paper. For simplicity's sake, I have not included any explanations in this basic definition. But one might wish to append to it the following paragraphs of commentary: The “designation” of the number of page-units determining each format generally takes the form of one of a series of traditional terms (most of which express the fraction of a whole sheet occupied by one leaf), such as full-sheet leaf, folio, quarto, octavo, duodecimo, sextodecimo, and so forth (or their abbreviations, such as 1°, 2° or F, 4° or 4to or Q, 8° or 8vo, 12° or 12mo, 16° or 16mo, etc.). 85 The phrase “printing surface” is used instead of “type” in order to accommodate the possibility not only of other kinds of relief surfaces (such as woodblocks or stereotype plates) but also of intaglio and planographic surfaces (such as engraved plates and lithographic stones); the fact that the three basic kinds of surface cannot be printed together on one press, or that multiple page-units of the same kind of surface may not in some instances be on the press at the same time, does not affect the designation of format. In the reference to sheets of a “selected” size, “selected” is meant to encompass the various situations that occur: the size selected may coincide with the dimensions of a particular stock of paper as it was manufactured or as it arrived at the printing shop or scriptorium from the manufacturer; or the size selected may be smaller and therefore require cutting by the printer or scribe before use; or it may be larger and require the pasting of papers together. Thus for the purpose of designating format, the relevant sheet size is not necessarily the manufactured size, as when extra-large paper was cut down to a more usual size, or when ordinary-sized paper was altered to another size and then treated as a full sheet. However, cutting before printing or writing was not always done to create a new size of sheet but rather as an expedient for using the original size, as when the earliest printers cut sheets only to simplify the process of printing from one- or two-page formes; in such cases, the original size remains the one “selected.” In other words, when cutting before printing or writing was the equivalent of folding afterward, the original size is relevant for format; but when such cutting was performed for the purpose of creating a new size of sheet (and thus was not the equivalent of later folding), it is the cut size that is relevant for format. The possible plural of “size(s)” is meant to recognize that an item may have been printed or written on sheets of different sizes and that it therefore is of two or more formats. For printed items, this possibility is applicable primarily to books from the earliest decades of printing, when formes of the same size might print a small full sheet and half a larger sheet that could not easily be printed in any other way; but after that period, when formes normally contained the page-units for all of one side of a selected sheet (as defined above), the situation would seem to arise only if the size of the forme were altered or if two sheets were placed on the press simultaneously. The final phrase “for the purpose of printing one side of the paper” is necessary because composite cylinder presses, with a forme on each of two cylinder-units, can print both sides of the paper at one time; but format refers only to the number of type-pages in one such forme, not to the total number of type-pages on the press. Adoption of this definition would cause no disruption in the way most bibliographers treat format and no change in the way most printed books are already classified. What I hope it accomplishes is to state the concept in a fashion that makes it equally applicable to all situations, including those that in the past have been thought to challenge it and require special treatment. For clarity of analytical thinking, one must have concepts that can be applied uniformly to divergent circumstances. Agreeing to this conception of format does not, of course, have anything to do with deciding how many other details of the presswork process should be reported. When I say that in a phrase like “inverted Crown octavo” the first two words do not refer to aspects of format, I am not downgrading the information they convey or suggesting that it need not be reported. In a full bibliographical description such details as the size of the sheet and of the leaf, the cutting of sheets before printing, and the precise manner of imposition should be commented on somewhere, probably in the paragraphs on paper and presswork. 86 Just where they are reported is a matter of writing or presentation, and one could certainly choose to include them in the format and collation paragraph; my point is that they are not logically required to be there, since they are not part of format. One might well decide, however, especially in brief descriptions, that such information ought indeed to be combined with format and signature collation to form a compact record of the most significant production details. Paul Needham, for example, has usefully recommended that entries in incunable catalogues should include state- ments on the pattern of “R4°(½-sh.),” meaning “Royal quarto printed on half-sheets.” Well aware of the fact that such expressions cover more than format, Needham describes his system as “combining paper size with format on the same description line.” It also, with the inclusion of “½-sh.,” gives one some information about presswork and outer-edge conjugacies as well. 87 Even in full descriptions, where such details are discussed in other paragraphs, a case can be made for the value of this kind of concise summary. How one reports historical data is properly influenced both by the rigor of one's analytical procedures and by the depth of one's understanding of how the information can be used; but, as with every genre of writing, no one form of presentation will necessarily seem the most appropriate for every situation. What must be kept in mind above all is that procedural concepts should not be approached as puzzles that one struggles to fit evidence into, but rather as aids to clear thinking—for the goal finally is to set forth what happened at a past moment with as much clarity as possible.</field>

As long as the bibliographer reports somewhere whether the sheets placed on the press were cut or uncut (when that fact can be ascertained), readers will know—using that information in conjunction with the format designation and collation formula—just how many outer-edge conjugacies remained after folding. But their precise sequence will not necessarily be known unless it is specifically reported. Thus, for example, a quarto printed on half-sheets will have no outer-edge conjugacies remaining after printing, regardless of the quiring; a quarto printed on whole sheets and gathered in sixes will have in each quire two top-edge conjugacies plus two leaves with no outer-edge conjugacies, but those two leaves could be either the first and last of the quire or the third and fourth. Patterns of outer-edge conjugacies could be concisely reported using the standard notation for sewing-fold conjugacy (the period between leaf numbers), with a label attached—e.g., “top-edge conjugacy: $1.2, 5.6”. Or else one could adopt different punctuation for each kind of conjugacy—such as “$1.2” for top-edge conjugacy, “$5:6” for fore-edge conjugacy, and “$3;4” for bottom-edge conjugacy. 84 I believe it is more useful to think of “arrangement” in terms of the relationship of pages in the gathering rather than their relationship in the sheet or forme. If one took the latter approach, one would say that the difference between common and inverted octavo imposition is not analogous to the difference between ordinary folio imposition and folio-in-sixes imposition. An inverted octavo forme involves all the same numbered pages as does a common octavo forme; they are just arranged differently. But in the folio example, one could argue that the arrangement of pages is no different in either case, since whether the third page or the eleventh page of a gathering (for example) occupies one half of a forme does not alter the fact that the same position is in each case being occupied by the second page in terms of page-number order within the forme. The shopmen who made up formes, however, had to think in terms of gatherings when deciding which type-pages to place in the same formes; and I think it makes sense to follow their lead and regard differences in quiring or gathering as necessitating, by definition, differences in imposition. Thus differences in imposition do not necessarily lead to different numbers of leaves in gatherings, but differences in the number of leaves per gathering always result from differences of imposition. 85 Expressions on the pattern of “2 up” and “4 up” should not be employed as format terms. The are sometimes used to state the number of type-pages (and/or blank pages) on the press at one time, a usage that is not fully synonymous with format terms. They are also used in two additional senses in connection with machine-printing: “2 up” can mean that pages for two independent books are placed in the same forme; “4 up” can mean that all the pages for four gatherings are on the press together. 86 See my “The Treatment of Typesetting and Presswork in Bibliographical Description” (see note 40 above) and “The Bibliographical Description of Paper,” SB, 24 (1971), 27-67 (reprinted in Selected Studies in Bibliography [1979], pp. 203-243).

      <field name="heading_text">The Calculus of Calculus: W. W. Greg and the Mathematics of Everyman Editions by JOSEPH A. DANE and ROSEMARY A. ROBERTS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There are four recorded sixteenth-century copies of Everyman, each from a different edition: two by John Skot (1528, STC 10606) (1535, STC 10606.5), and two by Richard Pynson (1515, STC 10604) (1526, STC 10604.5). The two Skot copies are complete. The first Pynson copy is a four-leaf fragment (including the colophon); the second Pynson copy lacks signature A (12 leaves). In 1910, in the final volume of his critical editions of these fragments, W. W. Greg considered what these surviving copies indicate about the popularity of this text; how many editions might have been produced in the early sixteenth century? Since no two of the four surviving copies are from the same edition, what can we say about the total number of editions that were produced? Greg's note is as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is obvious that, if no more than 4 editions are printed, it is very unlikely that, of 4 surviving copies, each should belong to a different edition (in point of fact the chance is only 3/32 or about 1 in 11), and that as the number of editions printed increases so does the probability of such an occurrence. There must therefore be a point (a particular number of editions) at which the chance approximates most nearly to 1/2. That number is 10, for which the actual chance is 1/2 + 1/250. Ten, therefore, is the smallest number of editions which make the actually occurring arrangement as likely as not to occur. 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Greg attributes the solution to this problem and the mathematics to J. E. Littlewood, professor of mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge. But Greg does not make explicit the nature of the precise problem he presented to Littlewood, nor what assumptions he included with that problem.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The purpose of the present paper is to reconstruct those assumptions, and to deal more generally with the implications of the use of probability in such bibliographical problems. We will deal with the question in two parts, based on the two sets of assumptions that Greg and his mathematician seem to have used. In part 1, we will first reconstruct the mathematical model that was used by Greg and Littlewood. The assumptions specific to the various calculations are as follows, and Greg and Littlewood must at some point have discussed these explicitly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. The total number of books is “large” (say, “over 100”; Greg's calculations are not applicable if the hypothetical editions consist of only one or two members);</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. All editions have approximately the same number of books.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We will then relax these restrictions in order to see to what extent what might be called the “Printers of the Mind” situation (under which all printers print the same number of book-copies in each edition) operates in the real world of printing (where printers produce editions of different sizes).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In part 2, we will deal explicitly with a second set of assumptions—assumptions that are necessary to construct the mathematical model. These are the following:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. All book-copies under consideration have an equal chance of surviving;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. Such book-copies survive independently of each other;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3. Each book-copy either survives or it does not survive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Such fundamental assumptions were perhaps never articulated by Greg and Littlewood in their discussions, and Greg's note contains not even an allusion to them. As a mathematician, Littlewood might have found such assumptions so basic as hardly to deserve mention; but for bibliography, they are of course extremely problematic.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our expectations were mathematical and bibliographical. Mathematically, we expected that the solution to the problem would depend on fairly restrictive assumptions of regularity: uniform edition size, and minimum edition size. These expectations were not entirely accurate, and there are interesting implications here easily brought out through the use of a modern calculator that might well have escaped Greg and Littlewood. Bibliographically, we expected to find that material and quantitative evidence such as that at issue here can only support pre- existent assumptions—that any mathematical model would do no more than reflect the set of initial bibliographical assumptions brought to it. Again, the mathematics suggests that this expectation also needs modification.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Page 119.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part 1: The Greg-Littlewood Solution</field>
      <field name="fulltext">According to Greg, the likelihood that any four surviving book copies will belong to four separate editions is 3/32. If we take extreme cases (for example, edition sizes of one), we see that this figure does not apply to all cases: if each print-run is one, then the chances that four extant copies belong to four separate editions is 100% regardless of the number of editions. These figures, therefore, seem to be based on at least one unstated assumption: (1) that the total number of book-copies is sufficiently “large.” A second assumption is also necessary here—(2) that each edition is the same size. This is the restriction that we will relax later in the discussion below. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let there be n editions with k 1 , k 2 , k 3 ,..., k n the number of book-copies in each edition. We assume uniform edition-size, that is: k 1 = k 2 = k 3 =... =k n . We will call this edition-size k. The probability that four surviving book-copies will come from different editions is:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In this formula, is the number of ways to choose the 4 editions from n editions; is the number of ways to choose 1 of the k book-copies from each of the four chosen editions; and is the number of ways to choose 4 book-copies from the nk available. Now:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Page 120.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As long as nk, the total number of book-copies, is “large” (about 100) this is approximately:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) n 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For values of n, the number of editions, ranging from 4 to 10, we get the following values for the probability that 4 copies belong to different editions. This is clearly the same series and the same solution presented to Greg by Littlewood:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No. of editions: 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Probability: 3/32 24/125 60/216 120/343 210/512 336/729 504/1000</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the number of editions increases beyond 10, the probability increases and can be made arbitrarily close to one. Greg chose to focus on the number of editions needed to make the probability exceed 1/2—we call this the “magic number.” Clearly, however, it is possible for the four surviving book-copies to come from different editions with any number of editions (as long as there are four or more) and Greg's choice of 1/2 is somewhat arbitrary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since the figures in the above series are exactly Greg's figures (504/1000 = 1/2 + 1/250), it appears that Greg and Littlewood simply assumed for these calculations that all editions were the same size. Based on generally accepted edition sizes (in the early twentieth century, these might have been estimated at between 500 and 1500 for pamphlets such as Everyman ), it is interesting to see what the definition of “large” must be in order for Greg's math to work. Contrary to our expectations, the formula is not particularly sensitive to variation in edition size, and works quite well for any real world estimates.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Assuming edition sizes of 1000, the specific probabilities of four surviving copies belonging to four separate editions are 3.005/32 (if there are only four editions) and 5.043/10 (if there are ten editions); the number of editions required to produce a greater than 50% chance that four copies will belong to four separate editions is ten. Greg's figures are nearly the same. Assuming an edition size of 500 yields the following corresponding probabilities: 3.009/32 and 5.046/10. There is no significant change. If we assume 100 book-copies per edition (perhaps the lowest figure anyone might accept), the corresponding fractions are 3.045/32 and 5.070/10. Again, there is little change. At 10 book-copies per edition, there is again, much to our surprise, little change in these fractions: 3.501/32 and 5.355/10. To attain more than a 50% chance that the four copies will belong to four separate editions still requires ten editions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Page 121.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Under the assumption of editions of uniform size, then, the calculations of Greg and Littlewood seem to hold for any range of edition-size that bibliographers would accept. The probability is not particularly sensitive to edition size—a result we found somewhat surprising.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now let us relax the operative assumption here of uniform edition size (that is, that k 1 = k 2 = k 3 =... = k n ); we doubt Greg and Littlewood went this far. The mathematics is slightly more complex, but the formulae are simple variants of the formulae above.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again let there be n editions with k 1 ,... k n the number of book-copies in each edition. It is convenient to call the average edition size k. Then the total number of book-copies is nkİ. Suppose that the four surviving books come from editions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The probability of this is:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Clearly this depends on k 1 , k 2 , k 3 , and k 4 —the number of book-copies in editions 1, 2, 3, and 4. If we calculate the probability of the four surviving books coming from editions 1, 2, 3, and 5, this will depend on the number of book-copies in editions 1, 2, 3, and 5, and will be a different value if k 4 and k 5 are different. To find the probability that the four surviving books come from different editions (the problem as stated by Greg), we must add up the probabilities of the books coming from every possible subset of four of the n editions. And to calculate this, we need to know how many book-copies there are in each edition. There is no getting around this. 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The formula above for editions 1, 2, 3, and 4 can be written:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If the total number of book-copies nkİ is “large,” (that is to say if 1- 1/nkİ, 1-2/nk, etc. are each nearly equal to 1), then the formula is approximately:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Page 122.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The value of this probability clearly depends on how close the edition sizes are to the average size although as above, it is not particularly sensitive to the average size of a print run. If all edition sizes are approximately equal, then the probability that the four surviving books come from different editions will be close to the probabilities given by Greg and calculated above.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By assuming here that edition sizes are approximately the same, the formula is the same as the formula we used above, since in this case, every edition size will be close to the average and each of the factors (k 1 /k̄),(k 2 /k̄),(k 3 /k̄),(k 4 /k̄) will be approximately 1. The question remains: how close do the number of book-copies per edition have to be to the average?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To answer this requires some calculations that are very easy with a modern calculator, but would have been tedious and time-consuming for anyone in 1910. Perhaps Littlewood did not mention this particular aspect of the problem to Greg.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let us consider an average edition size of 1000, and editions of 500, 750, 1250, 1500. The probability that four book-copies would come from different editions if only four editions were involved is, instead of 3/32 (Greg's figure), 2.113/32. For, say, eight editions, two of each size, we get 182/512, instead of Greg's 210/512. With twelve editions, three of each size, the probability would be 907/1728 instead of 990/1728 (the probability one would get using Greg's restricted formula). What we call the “magic number”—the number where the probability exceeds 1/2—increases to about 12 with print runs of these sizes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is interesting, of course, that if we assume a low average print run (say, 100) and use specific print runs in the same ratio as above (50, 75, 125, and 150), these figures do not change significantly. Again, the formula is not the least sensitive to the size of the average print-run. However, it is extremely sensitive to deviations from average: if, for example, we substitute the figures 90, 95, 105, 110 for those above, we get results much closer to those in Greg's calculations: 3.007/32; the implied “magic number” for sets of editions that differ from this average in these ratios would still be 10.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To take a more extreme example, but one that can be understood without resorting to the calculator, consider editions of only two sizes, 1000 and 1. 4 Assume further that for every edition of size 1000 there is an edition of size 1. In this case, the small editions will be nearly irrele- vant. The chances of four survivors being from different editions will be about 3/32 for eight rather than for four editions (4 of size 1000 and 4 irrelevant editions of size 1). The “magic number” will, instead of 10, be 20.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These calculations can be continued ad infinitum or ad nauseam. The cases above assume a regular distribution of edition size from average, but there is of course no need to do that. And we close with an even more extreme version of the last example. Let us suppose, for example, that there are an unknown number of editions—that one of them again has 1000 book-copies, and that the others are tentative runs with 1 copy each. You will need no calculator to see that the chances of four copies coming from four different editions if there are only a few of these trial editions is nearly 0. The calculator, for what it is worth, tells us that we would need 1594 such editions to reach the “magic number.” If we assume that these small editions contain, say, 10 book-copies, the magic number is 165.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In conclusion, Greg's calculations do not require print-runs that bibliographers would consider unusual; the notion of “large” required mathematically does not seem bibliographically problematic. But they do require an assumption of uniformity—that print-runs are close to average. And it is difficult to see how a bibliographical argument could be constructed to provide solid support for such an assumption. What is also interesting (and rather unnerving to one of us, who began this study believing that Greg had overestimated the number of early Everyman editions) is that relaxing some of Greg's unstated restrictions produces in many cases larger estimates of numbers of editions—precisely the point Greg seemed to be trying to make! Does this mean that STC—by any standards a monumental achievement of enumerative bibliography—grossly misrepresents the total number of editions that were actually produced before 1640? and are we to imagine dozens of lost editions of Everyman ?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part 2: General Assumptions</field>
      <field name="fulltext">More than twenty years ago, Robert Potter argued convincingly that the popularity of Everyman is to some extent illusory—a function of its later reception in the last two centuries, and not a fact of its early reception. 5 Obviously, Greg's estimate of ten contemporary editions of the play disputes such an argument, as indeed does our own skeptical chal- lenge to Greg's mathematics: when we relax Greg's overly restrictive assumptions of uniformity, we seem to end up with an even more popular and widely disseminated Everyman. How can this be?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Greg, interested in discovering evidence of a popular Everyman, might have welcomed this result, as we initially did not. But this result forces us to look at a second set of assumptions—assumptions so basic to the problem that Greg never mentions them:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. All book-copies under consideration have an equal chance of surviving;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. Book-copies survive independently of each other;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3. Each book-copy either survives or it does not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Any bibliographer who looks at these assumptions knows that they simply do not apply to the actual history of books and the survival of book-copies. Although bibliographers occasionally speak of the “accidental” survival of book-copies, there is no such thing as “accidental” in the mathematical sense, that is to say, “random.” In fact, a staple of bibliographical study and the study of provenance is the articulation of specific reasons for survival. Let us take each of these assumptions in turn in their more general form.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. Book-copies have an equal chance of surviving. They do not. Some early books are printed on vellum and are thus more likely to survive as, say, binding material in other books than those printed on paper (early Donatus grammars are the most obvious example); some are large and luxurious (the Gutenberg Bible has an extremely high survival rate). Some are beautifully illustrated; some are by Shakespeare. There is no end to such particulars, and let us consider only some factors that might affect the survival of copies of Everyman. Everyman is formally a play, and early printed copies of English plays acquired value in a way that other early English books did not: they were formal predecessors to Shakespeare. 6 The history of the reception of Everyman shows this clearly, with the introduction of the play text into the dramatic canon in the eighteenth century and the surfacing of other copies in the nineteenth. 7 There are other reasons: it was printed in black-letter by Pyn- son , and such books acquired value as they were incorporated into the antiquarian book trade. Copies were obviously thrown away as valueless in the sixteenth century; but they were less likely to be thrown away in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries; all four copies now are contained in major repositories, and the names that come up in the provenance histories are those of the great English collectors. 8 The survival of any particular book-copy, thus, is dependent on specific external factors, and the disappearance (or surfacing) of book-copies does not follow a random pattern.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fragments of sixteenth-century English printing, incorporated as binding material in other books, can still be found on the shelves of antiquarian book dealers. Those we have run across have been “Statutes” and we did not record them. And perhaps some unknown sixteenth-century statute has escaped bibliographical history through our negligence. But are we to check the shelves of these same dealers more diligently, imagining that if one sixteenth- century printed text can be found, then any other sixteenth-century printed text might be found as well? Perhaps the pastedowns and flyleaves of that next book will have speakers' names printed in the margins! An undiscovered Hickescorner ? A fifth copy of Everyman ? comparable to the Bodleian Pynson fragment? At this point in our musings, the real world intrudes. We know that in any real world bookshop, we will have no such luck, and the bookshops containing Everyman fragments are at best “Bookshops of the Mind.” The dealer who ignored the sixteenth-century statute will not ignore an Everyman fragment or an unrecorded speech from King Lear. Books and fragments of books simply do not enter and leave the book trade in random ways.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. Book-copies survive independently of each other. They do not. If a printer did not sell all his stock, the remaining books would have been destroyed as a unit, not independently. In addition, collectors do not buy and preserve early books at random. Some, like Richard Heber and Henry Clay Folger, deliberately sought out multiple copies of the same edition. Others, like Henry E. Huntington, systematically sold off such duplicates. 9 The survival of any one book-copy is thus potentially de- pendent on the survival of other book-copies involved in the problem, and forms of such dependence operate at all stages in the histories of these copies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3. Each book-copy either survives or it does not. That is to say, when flipping a coin, the coin comes up heads, or it comes up tails; there are no “leaners.” This at first glance seems obvious, but in early printing, it is not at all obvious. Let us consider the copies here. The two Skot copies are complete, and bear all the marks of editions in any bibliographical sense. The second Pynson copy (STC 10604.5), while incomplete, is missing only sig. A, and most catalogues even give its collation as [A 6 ]. But the status of the first Pynson copy (STC 10604) is not at all so clear: it is a binding fragment, consisting of a single leaf. There are no marks of use in this fragment, that is to say, no sign that it was ever read as a book. 10</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In bibliographical language, this fragment seems to be “printer's waste” (waste produced at the print shop from materials never incorporated into books), not “binder's waste” (waste from books that have been used and abandoned). 11 The difference in this case is crucial: “binder's waste” is from books that were distributed and read in the real world —it is thus evidence of both book-copies and the edition that produced those book-copies. But “printer's waste” only implies what might be called a “printer's project”; it implies nothing about whether that project was ever realized: we in fact do not know whether such a thing as this “first Pynson edition” of Everyman ever existed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Furthermore, catalogues dealing with such fragments do not record them in ways consistent with the ways in which they record other books. For incunables, fragments of many early gramamr books are assigned numbers in the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke and in union catalogues such as the British Library Incunable Short-Title Catalogue on the basis of location of particular fragments: the roughly 400 catalogue entries for the Donatus Ars minor in GW and in ISTC refer to 400 sets of fragments, each in a specific location. The number of editions these might represent is in GW taken up in the introductory note only, where the numbered entries are organized according to presumed editions. 12 Such fragments need to be distinguished from fragments that show evidence of having been incorporated within specific book-copies (for example, grammatical fragments with some marginalia, or owner's marks or signs of use). We are not aware, however, that attempts to sort these out as editions have specifically used such evidence; unmarked fragments seem to have the same bibliographical status as marked ones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Pynson fragment provides that mathematically malevolent example of a book that we cannot say exists or does not exist. We do not know for certain whether there is such an edition, even though we have an apparent fragment of a book-copy here. And thus, we cannot say whether we have a survival or not. And we cannot thus assume that bibliographical catalogues themselves reflect in any systematic way the actual way that book-copies survive. Catalogue decisions reflect the exigencies of cataloguing, not the reality of book-copies circulating in the real world. We are forced to deal with the fragment as a unique individual, not a representative one. 13</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conclusion</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1910, Everyman was still in the process of being canonized, a process Potter argues was abetted by the establishment in the twentieth century of the genre, the “Morality Play,” that Everyman seemed to exemplify. Greg spent considerable effort in editing Everyman and must have felt that what he had in the surviving copies was evidence of an important text, and at least a moderately popular one (surely printed more than four times); that is, he must have assumed that popularity or even historical import was a function of “number of editions,” particularly the number of “ordinary” editions. As a mathematician, Littlewood could do little more than give back to Greg a version of the information that Greg provided him: here is an important, moderately popular English text, and for such texts, it would not seem unreasonable to assume multiple editions of uniform size. The moderately popular text Greg defined for Littlewood then received its mathematical underpinnings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet other assumptions were also plausible: Everyman might not be a popular text at all, as evidenced by the absence of any contemporary allusion to it; and the four surviving copies might be anomalous, more an index of Shakespeare's popularity than the popularity of the text itself (they survived as “Shakespeareana”). What appear to be published and disseminated editions might actually be trial editions, aborted editions, and proof-sheets. Perhaps the pattern of survival reflects only the peculiar tastes of early collectors. Such considerations might have led Greg to various conclusions, but they undermine any form of mathematical modelling. In order for Greg to claim mathematical support for any conclusion (and thus to enhance his status as a rigorous bibliographical “calculator”), such inconvenient particularities would have to be ignored.</field>

For purposes of discussion, we are using only two terms here: edition (an hypothesized print-run) and book-copies (particular members of these print-runs).

(London, 1831), 2:310-312. 7 For the history of provenance, see Greg, “Everyman”, pp. 34-35. The first edition of Everyman after its eighteenth-century rediscovery is by Thomas Hawkins, The Origin of the English Drama, Illustrated in its various Species, viz. Mystery, morality, tragedy, and comedy, 3 vols. (Oxford, 1773) (vol. 1); the prefatory essay for Everyman is taken directly from the second edition of Thomas Percy's Reliques. The increasing import of the play to English histories of drama is sketched in part through various editions of Dodsley's multi- volume anthology Old Plays. Everyman is still not included in the third edition of 1825 (with additions by Collier) but first added, from Hawkins, to the fourth edition of 1874, edited by Hazlitt. It is not mentioned in the influential discussion of moralities by Thomas Warton, History of English Poetry, 3 vols. (London, 1778-81), e.g., 2:360-366. 8 Copy A (now at the Huntington Library)—Dibdin, Spencer, Heber, Britwell; copy B (British Library)—Huth; copy C (Bodleian Library)—Douce; copy D (British Library) (Garrick?

Since colophons are generally assumed to have been printed late in a print-run, we might want to assume that there is a good likelihood that this is part of a complete edition, not a mere trial sheet. But as far as we know, there is no way to quantify these speculations.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">“THE ETERNAL VERITIES VERIFIED”: CHARLTON HINMAN AND THE ROOTS OF MECHANICAL COLLATION by Steven Escar Smith *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Hinman Collator represents one of the most important applications of technology to the study of literature ever made. Yet only a part of the story of its invention is widely known, and that is often distorted in the telling. Moreover, many important influences and antecedents are largely lost in the shadows of bibliographical history. This essay will address known, unknown, forgotten, and misunderstood aspects of the beginnings of mechanical collation and along the way attempt to place the collator, or at least its birth, in a broader historical context. It will also examine the commercial manufacture and sale of the collator and attempt to assess some of the factors behind the machine's early and lasting prominence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The collator was developed in the late 1940s by the Shakespeare scholar Charlton Joseph Kadio Hinman [plate 1]. By 1978, when the last machine was manufactured, around fifty-nine had been acquired by libraries, academic departments, research institutes, government agencies, a few private individuals, and a handful of pharmaceutical companies. 1 Though built for the study of printed texts and used primarily for the creation of critical editions of literary authors, the Hinman Collator has also been employed in other projects where the close comparison of apparently identical images is required, everything from the study of illustrations to the examination of watermarks to the detection of forged banknotes. Since the 1960s other collating machines have been developed and over the years alternative methods of collation proposed, but none has been as successful or influential as that developed by Charlton Hinman. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hinman's invention greatly increased not only the speed at which texts could be compared but also the effectiveness of such comparisons, and it made collation on a large scale possible for the first time. The most famous use of the machine was by its inventor and resulted in his Printing and Proof-reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963) and the Norton facsimile of the First Folio (1968). Hinman estimated that without the aid of his machine, the research for these projects would have taken over forty years. Without the collator, as he himself recognized, his study would have been a “practical impossibility” ( Printing 8), as would have the work of the many scholars who compiled dozens of bibliographies, produced hundreds of volumes of critical editions, and undertook countless bibliographical and textual investigations on his machine over the next five decades.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I In 1946, Charlton Hinman applied for a patent on his new machine, then still in its earliest developmental stages (“Mechanized Collation: A Preliminary Report” 101). He was just back from the war, where he had served as an officer in a naval intelligence group based in Washington, D.C. (Tanselle, Life 33). Before entering the military, he was working as a Research Fellow at the Folger Shakespeare Library, engaged in the arduous task of collating by hand the First Folio text of Othello (Bond, Letter). This work was an extension of his dissertation, “The Printing of the First Quarto of Othello. ” He had taken his doctoral degree in 1941 from the University of Virginia, where he was Fredson Bowers' first Ph.D. candidate (Tanselle, Life 33). Hinman had chosen from the very start of his career to associated himself with projects that involved the close examination of printed texts. This was a natural choice given the exceedingly analytical, not to mention practical, turn of his mind. When he graduated from high school, his father had insisted that he take six months of vocational training before entering college. Through middle age he was a “tinkerer,” making croquet mallets on his wood lathe, building retaining walls, and taking on other around-the-house projects (Barbara Hinman). His second wife, Myra Mahlow, commented that he was “just the kind of man who ought to be associated with printing... because he liked things down in black and white. He liked to see the eternal verities verified” (Martin). The purpose of the machine for which he was seeking a patent was straightforward and grew directly from the needs of his research. During the Renaissance, the period of his specialty, books were proofread and corrected continually during the printing process, and early uncorrected sheets were commonly bound up with corrected ones from later in the print run. Thus the printed matter in the last book sold could, and usually did, differ substantially from that of the first, as it also could and quite often did from nearly every other copy in the printing. These variations are precisely the details the collator was developed to help detect. The operation of the device Hinman would eventually build was also straightforward. The operator sets up one book turned to a particular page on a platform on one side of the machine and another copy from the same printing turned to the same page on a platform on the other. He or she then views these items, which are superimposed via a set of mirrors, through a pair of binocular optics. After making adjustments to bring the two objects into registration, the operator activates a system of lights that alternately illuminates each page. If the pages are identical, they more or less appear as one; if they are not identical, the points of difference are called to the operator's eye by appearing to dance or wiggle about. The work that Hinman conducted at the Folger before the war was part of a long and unglamorous tradition: centuries earlier, Samuel Johnson, for instance, had observed that collation is “dull” but “necessary” work (Preface xlviii). Collating Othello at the Folger, Hinman was carrying out his research (Hinman, “Alternate Projection”), as had generations of scholars before him, by what some editors have termed the “Wimbledon method” (McLeod, McLeod Portable Collator 2). With two copies of a book open before him, he read from each alternately, line by line and letter by letter, looking back and forth, keeping his place with the aid of a fingertip. Another time-honored technique, though there is no evidence that he used it, is sometimes called “circle collation” and requires more than one person (Oakman 333). One individual reads aloud while the others follow along silently. Done correctly, the person reading aloud calls out marks of punctuation, line breaks, dropped-letters, and other printed features in addition to the words. Collation has always been a laborious and time-consuming activity, but compared to machine collation the older techniques are particularly tedious. Partly because of this, they are also vulnerable to mistakes. In the Wimbledon method, it is very easy to overlook something as one's eyes dart back and forth between pages. In the other method, unless all readers exercise extreme care, it is difficult to differentiate homonyms, e.g., “knight” and “night.” The circle method also does not do a good job of distinguishing alternate spellings of the same word, “go” and “goe,” to take a famous example from the First Folio. Because these routines also involve the act of reading, it is easy for a researcher to be distracted from typographical features by the content of the text. In addition, neither technique is amenable to efficient collation of multiple copies. Hinman was distinguished from the many collator-scholars before him by the scale and intensity of his work, for never before had the writings of Shakespeare, or any other author, been subjected to such a close textual reading in so many apparently identical copies. The scholarly scrutiny of the physical characteristics of books dated back several decades before the invention of his machine. At the beginning of the twentieth century, building on the work of a few nineteenth-century trailblazers (notably Henry Bradshaw and William Blades), W. W. Greg and other proponents of what would come to be known as the New Bibliography sought to raise the standards of their field. They advocated techniques and methods that they found lacking in most past as well as contemporary projects, namely “observation, comparison, formal rules of procedure, analysis of materials, and logic” (Maguire 32). Though these qualities are common to good research in any field, it was precisely their conspicuous absence in so many bibliographical undertakings that led Greg and his fellow reformers to encourage a more “scientific” approach. Much has been made of their association of bibliography with science, and it is not my purpose either to revive or review those discussions here. Suffice it to say that in using the term they were attempting to underscore the rigorous and systematic nature of their work in contrast to what they saw as little more than a “dilettante interest in old books merely as antiquarian objects” (Tanselle, “Bibliography” 60). 3 In the history of this movement, the name Fredson Bowers stands equal to, if not even a little ahead of, that of W. W. Greg. Bowers was a second generation New Bibliographer, but his contributions to the theory and development of the movement were enormous. It has been observed that he put the “American” in the “Anglo-American” approach to bibliography (Tanselle, Life 146). In studying under Bowers, Hinman was receiving his New Bibliographical training in situ. One commentator even referred to the collator as an “electronic Bowers” (“Mechanized” 156). Though offered in jest, this description is particularly apt. The machine descends directly from the most important aspect of the New Bibliography—its rigorous emphasis on physical evidence and specifically the evidence found in the very objects under investigation. Greg, Bowers, et al. made books the focus of research in a way that they had never been before; they were now primary evidence in their own history. There were people, as will be discussed below, who preceded Hinman in the attempt to use technology as an aid to the study books and printing, and in time this emphasis on physical evidence would lead to the introduction of photography, microscopes, beta-radiography, micrometers, and other techniques and tools to the field. However, the Hinman Collator, as the first and the most famous device invented specifically for the close and systematic analysis of printed works, represents the spirit of this movement incarnate. In a sense, it is indeed an electronic New Bibliographer. For Hinman as a textual critic, the underlying assumptions as well as the overall goal of his research were also the same as for his theoretical forebears, though they were the originators of neither the goal nor the assumptions. Their analytical and material-based emphasis was new, but the orientation and aim of their work was the same as it had been for generations of editors. W. W. Greg and Samuel Johnson worked under essentially the same paradigm and sought the same quarry. Both men saw the printing process as inherently corruptive and both desired to excise those corruptions to establish a text more representative of what the author in question wanted or intended. As with Johnson, the author whose intentions Hinman was pursuing was no less than the inimitable Bard himself, though Hinman came to the task with a much more sophisticated knowledge of the printed remnants before him as physical structures. The collator was invented precisely to help detect, and thus help sweep away, all the non-authorial words, letters, and even marks of punctuation standing between Hinman and the ideal exemplar he was striving to reconstruct. In words that echoed those of editors for hundreds of years before him, he described his goal as nothing less than the reconstitution of “what Shakespeare actually wrote” ( Printing vii). In addition to a practical cast of mind, a theoretical framework that emphasized the books themselves as primary evidence, an orientation toward the author as the authority in textual matters, and training at the hands of the individual who would become the foremost textual and bibliographical scholar of the postwar era, Hinman also had before him a famous example of the application of technology to bibliographical research. In 1910, William J. Neidig used composite photographs to superimpose images of title-pages in the famous Pavier quartos (Neidig) [plate 2]. By this method, Neidig confirmed Greg's earlier contention that most of these nine Shakespeare plays had been printed in 1619 rather than variously in 1600, 1608, and 1619, as their title pages are dated. When Neidig examined his superimposed images, he found that the upper half of the pages varied as the titles of the plays changed. The bottom half of each page, however, often registered exactly the same in many details, even in regard to the wear of the type and nicks in the woodcut ornament. No seventeenth-century printer would have left a title-page standing for twenty years, and neither could a compositor have successfully reproduced the pages so exactly. Therefore the plays must have been printed, as Neidig concluded and Greg had earlier argued, at the same time. Both Neidig and Hinman, though a few decades apart, were collating texts, only in slightly different ways. Neidig, perhaps because he was more interested in similarities than differences, did not take the next step of viewing the pages alternately. Nevertheless, in striking on the idea of superimposition, he carried a baton that would later be passed to Charlton Hinman, though Neidig himself would not do the passing. In the 1930s, Edwin Eliott Willoughby recognized in the seventy-nine copies of the First Folio at the Folger a treasure trove of textual and bibliographical data. The Folio had been the subject of his graduate work, and in 1932 he revised and published his research in a short monograph on the subject ( Printing ). Willoughby realized, as Hinman would a few years later, that by traditional methods the collation of all those copies of the Folio would take more than one working lifetime. In 1933 he proposed a project to collate the First Folios and set out to find an optical instrument which would “superimpose the image of a page of the Folio in one copy upon the same page in another copy” (Willoughby, Uses 95). He apparently located two such devices, though where he found them and specifically how they worked he did not say. Neither did he use them for very long. One generated too much heat to be safe for books and the other caused severe eyestrain. Furthermore, Willoughby, like Neidig, only pursued the idea of mechanical collation as far as superimposition. The advantages of viewing images alternately did not occur to him. However, in attempting to apply collation by superimposition to regular pages of text rather than just title-pages, Willoughby carried the baton a bit further than Neidig and, more importantly, passed it on to Hinman. In 1941, during Hinman's term as a Research Fellow at the Folger, Willoughby, who was on the Library staff, told Hinman about his earlier experiments ( Uses 95). There were other runners before and between Neidig and Willoughby, however. In 1931, G. A. E. Bogeng, librarian of the Herzog August Bibliothek in Wolfenbüttel, described the use of the stereoscope to superimpose printed texts in the search for typographical variants (Bogeng 138-140). Stereoscopes have been around since the early nineteenth century and have been used for many purposes. They were a popular Victorian parlor novelty, and they were also used by astronomers (“Stereoscope”). Bogeng, in fact, was not the first to envision a textual application for the device. In 1894, the Frenchman F. Drouin proposed the stereoscope for the detection of forged banknotes. He also suggested that the device might be useful in the examination of printed books, though, not being a bibliographer, the idea of using it to discover typographical variants within editions did not occur to him. He suggested instead that the device might be useful for distinguishing between similarly typeset copies of different editions (Drouin 102-103). Drouin described several different types and configurations of the device, though he did not specify which would be best for working with books. Neither is it possible to tell from Bogeng's account what kind of stereoscope he was describing. It does not appear that he was writing about one designed exclusively for bibliographical work, however. He spent a good deal of effort explaining the difficulties produced by the device's restricted field of vision. If he or someone else had put one together specifically for textual collation, it seems likely that they would have designed an apparatus capable of displaying an area adequate for the texts they were studying. But if Bogeng was not describing a stereoscope built or adapted especially for the study of books or other printed documents, his description also does not offer any clues as to whether he was describing the use of one borrowed from an observatory or some other source. Whether Hinman knew of Bogeng's work (or Bogeng of Drouin's suggestions) is not known, but there is some evidence that Hinman may have experimented with a stereoscope just after the war. 4 More generally, there were also other scholars and individuals who had used technology for bibliographical or closely related purposes. In 1935, R. B. Haselden published a short monograph on the use of scientific devices for the study of manuscripts. One of the instruments he recommended was the comparison microscope. Though it neither overlays nor alternates images, this device is suggestive of optical collation (Haselden 50-52). Haselden also drew on works that discussed the study of paper and books in law enforcement, specifically for the detection of fakes and forgeries. The forensic investigation of documents has a long tradition outside of but not completely unknown within bibliographical circles. In his history of papermaking, Dard Hunter cited many early twentieth-century legal cases that utilized the examination, and in some instances the “collation,” of watermarks (408-427). Hunter's examples involved a different kind of evidence from what Hinman used, but they provide examples of and precedents for a material-based approach that pre-dates Hinman by several decades. The influence of forensics is most evident in Carter and Pollard's study of the Wise forgeries, the most brilliant example of analytical bibliography to precede Hinman. They drew on the technical expertise of individuals in the fields of papermaking and of type design and manufacture, and used tools such as the microscope to analyze paper fibers as well as to compare typographical impressions. The extent to which any of these individuals knew of or were influenced by each others' work, or how much if anything Hinman owed to any of them other than Willoughby, is unknown. Carter and Pollard, Neidig, and even Haselden (given that his monograph was published by the Bibliographical Society) would have certainly been known to Hinman. The important point, however, is that individuals before him pondered similar problems and attempted to solve them in very similar ways. 5 Though Hinman's military service interrupted his work at the Folger, ultimately it only hastened the progress of his research, for separated from all those copies of the First Folio he had the time to seriously think about mechanical collation and its labor-saving potential. He was trained as a Navy cryptanalyst and assigned to a code-breaking unit in Washington, D.C., though he would spend most of the war on special assignment in Australia (Bond, Letter). Other members of his intelligence unit no doubt encouraged his wartime ruminations. Fredson Bowers was his commanding officer, and William H. Bond, Giles Dawson, and Ray O. Hummell, all of who would go on to distinguished bibliographical careers after the war, served in the same group. In the course of his service Hinman heard a story about the analysis of aerial photographs that guided his thoughts on mechanical collation. He later reported it in two slightly different versions, the best known of which was published in the pages of Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America. There he states that the military used aerial photography as an aid in the evaluation of target areas—“gun emplacements and the like.” The process involved taking aerial photographs before and after a bombing run. The images were later overlaid on a screen and then viewed alternately: “first one picture for a fraction of a second, then the other picture for the same brief period, then the first picture again, and so on. The result was—or at any rate was supposed to be—that wherever there had been no change in the target area since it had first been photographed the screen showed only a single, perfectly motionless picture of that area; but that wherever there had been a change the picture on the screen flickered or wobbled” (“Mechanized Collation: A Preliminary Report” 103). The other version was delivered as a lecture in June of 1947 to the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia. It is essentially the same except that he does not explicitly mention bombing. Instead, he recounts that aerial photography was used to evaluate the movement of enemy supplies and other resources. He also now sets the scene in the Pacific and specifically identifies the Japanese as the object of this observation (“Why 79” 12). In both instances he states that the story was not completely true. The military did use aerial photography in its intelligence gathering efforts. Many so-called “pre-” and “post-strike” photographs survive in archival collections Charlton Joseph Kadio Hinman Composite photograph produced by William J.

Furthermore, the military did experiment with various techniques to heighten the effectiveness of aerial photography. For example, Harold E. Edgerton, an MIT engineer and pioneer of high-speed photography, was employed by the Army Air Force to build a better electronic flash device for night time surveillance. The part of the story that was false involved the superimposition and alternate viewing of pictures. The military, as Hinman later pointed out, conducted experiments along these lines (Gwinn) but to his knowledge had no “success in this particular kind of photographic reconnaissance” (“Why 79” 12) for “several good reasons” (“Mechanized Collation: A Preliminary Report” 103). Hinman did not enumerate these reasons, but at least one of them is not difficult to imagine. Using World War II technology, it simply would not have been possible to photograph the same patch of ground twice from exactly the same altitude and position in the sky under the same atmospheric conditions, and without being able to replicate those conditions more or less exactly, the two photographs would not have registered well enough to make their superimposition possible, much less meaningful. The importance of the story for Hinman was that the “underlying principles” were sound and thus helped steer him in the right direction (“Mechanized Collation: A Preliminary Report” 102). 6 Fascination with Hinman's wartime experience has led to a glossing over or exaggeration of certain of its aspects and, in turn, to some misunderstanding about the development of mechanical collation. It should be emphasized that Hinman's unit specialized in cryptanalytic work and not photographic analysis (Bond, Telephone, 30 March 2001). Thus, the aerial photography experiment was something that Hinman “heard,” perhaps from a neighboring unit or a colleague elsewhere in the intelligence community, and not something that he observed directly. This fact by itself may account for the slight differences in the two versions of the story and some of the ambiguity that has surrounded it. He possessed no first-hand knowledge that the military had a method of examining photographs similar to the one that he used to study books. Another detail that has been misunderstood (and Hinman never made the point clearly himself) is whether machine collation first occurred to him during the war and as a result of his intelligence work. 7 The war certainly played an important part, but not because it gave him the idea of the collator in the first place. Rather, the war provided the time to ponder an idea he had been considering for some time, to speculate “on ways to avoid such labors [i.e. textual collation by sight]” (“Why 79” 1). The war also put Hinman in an environment, surrounded by like-minded scholars and supervised by his dissertation advisor, unusually conducive to bibliographical musings. And, as I have shown, Hinman was also not the first person to harness technology in an effort to study texts generally or even to compare copies from within the same edition. Unfortunately the aerial reconnaissance story has been repeated so often that it has eclipsed a more important technological antecedent, and one that actually worked. Arthur M. Johnson, who would take over the commercial manufacture of the collator, wrote that Hinman developed the basic design of his machine after studying something called the “astronomer's microscope” (Johnson, Letter to William P. Barlow, 21 Nov. 1973; Johnson, Hinman Collator [1972?] I ). The device to which Johnson was referring is properly known as the blink comparator [plate 3] and was invented in 1904 by the German instrument-maker Carl Pulfrich (Drummeter 14). The basic principle behind the blink comparator is the same as that of the Hinman. Two objects, in this case photographs of the same star field taken on different dates, are set up in the machine, superimposed, and then viewed alternately. Any difference between the images calls attention to itself by appearing, just as on the Hinman, to dance or move about. The most famous use of the comparator was made by C. W. Tombaugh, who discovered the planet Pluto with it in 1930 (Moore 81; Abbott 158). Hinman knew of this machine and may have even investigated adapting it for books (Bond, Letter). A primitive blink comparator had been used at the McCormick Observatory at the University of Virginia from the 1920s through the 1940s ( Virtual Museum ). It is not known if Hinman ever saw the comparator at Virginia, but we do know that he spent time studying, if not an actual device, then at least the principles behind its operation. The military's unsuccessful wartime experiments may have encouraged Hinman, but the blink comparator was the real technological model for his machine. The collator is therefore better viewed not as a completely new invention but rather as a new application of an older technology. Hinman himself said his device was based on “conventional principles” put to use “in what patent lawyers call `a new mechanical environment'” (“Mechanized Collation at the Houghton Library” 132). 8 When commenting on Hinman's demonstration of the prototype to the Bibiographical Society of America in 1947, the editor of PBSA was careful to place the word “machine” in quotation marks, suggesting perhaps that the operation of the device was a good deal less precise at this point than the word normally merits (“Mechanized Collation: A Preliminary Report” 99). The primary components of the prototype, as Hinman famously described them, were a “pair of ordinary microfilm projectors (borrowed from the Navy), some pieces of wooden apple box (abstracted from a trash pile), some heavy cardboard (begged from the Folger bindery), and parts of a rusty Erector set (more or less hi-jacked from the small son of a close personal friend)” (“Mechanized Collation: A Preliminary Report” 102). 9 An unacknowledged contributor to this prototype was John Cook Wyllie, Curator of Rare Books at the University of Virginia. Very early on, Hinman thought that the use of “color differentiation” might help in the collation process (Hinman, Letter to John Cook Wyllie, 21 Mar. 1946). The idea was to heighten differences between the pages being compared by preparing the microfilm images of them in contrasting colors. When the images were then overlaid and alternated, any variants would call attention to themselves by not only appearing to dance about but also by showing themselves in different colors, or so the theory went. Wyllie was the point man on this idea. He conducted experiments for Hinman at Virginia using the Eastman Kodak “wash-off relief process” (Hinman, Letter to John Cook Wyllie, 28 Feb. 1946). Although Wyllie achieved beautiful reproductions with this method, they appear not to have worked for collational purposes. Apparently the “scale of reduction necessary for efficient folio work” made the color differences meaningless (Wyllie, Letter to Charlton Hinman, 18 Apr. 1946), and the whole scheme was rendered moot when Hinman redesigned the machine to work primarily with originals rather than photographic reproductions. Wyllie remained an interested and enthusiastic observer, however. He attended Hinman's 1946 demonstration of the prototype for the Modern Language Association (Wyl- lie , Letter to Charlton Hinman, 9 Jan. 1947). A few years later he also spear- headed the effort to bring one of the earliest commercially produced machines to Virginia. 10 Hinman submitted detailed drawings of his prototype with his patent application in 1946, and these drawings show a much more sophisticated design than his PBSA description suggests [plate 4]. The “Alternate Projection Collating Device” consisted of two microfilm projectors placed at right angles in very close proximity to one another. One projector (1) cast an image onto the reflective side of a small two-way mirror (2), which then deflected the image onto a screen (3). The other projector (4) was positioned so that its image was thrown upon the same screen (3) after passing through the back or non-reflective side of the same two-way mirror (2), and in this manner the two images were superimposed. Two occulting discs (11 and 7), one positioned in front of each projector, turned so as to interrupt the projection alternately, thus casting the images on the screen one after the other rather than simultaneously. The speed at which the discs turned, and therefore also the rapidity with which the two images were alternately cast upon the screen, was regulated by means of a rheostat (12). The whole apparatus was mounted on a kind of “bread board” platform (Hinman, Letter to John Cook Wyllie, [Mar. 1955]). Hinman carried out his first experimental collations with this device at the Folger in the summer of 1946. He was granted a patent in 1949, though by that time he had abandoned this design and completely reconfigured his idea into the machine we know today. The prototype suffered from four serious flaws: the researcher could not closely study discrepancies without getting in the way of the projected light; taking notes was difficult since the machine worked best in a darkened room (Johnson, Letter to William P. Barlow); the machine was noisy and thus disrupted other researchers (Mason, Personal); and in contrast to the final version, the prototype was not designed to work with the original texts but only with microfilm copies. The last of these shortcomings was the most serious, for collating from copies always involves, as Hinman well knew, some inherent disadvantages. A photographic image cannot always be relied upon to reproduce the original accurately. Fly specks, for example, are easily transformed into punctuation marks, and very faintly printed marks may not show up at all. Photographs are also expensive, and with a book of any length the time required to take and develop them would exceed that required to perform the collations. What was needed, he suggested, were two machines—one, which would be more common and more frequently used, for photographs, and a second, less common and less often used, for the originals (“Mechanized Collation: A Preliminary Report” 105). The device that Hinman would ultimately build could do both, though it was primarily intended for and has been predominantly used with original texts. Of course, gathering enough original copies of the book he needed was no problem. The Folger, with seventy-nine First Folios, had more than an adequate supply for his purpose. Mechanical collation owes its invention perhaps as much to the rich resources of the Folger as it does to the ingenuity of Charlton Hinman. Certainly without the availability of such a large sample of so important a book, comparison of copies, especially on such a large scale, would not have seemed nearly so necessary, let alone possible. By July 1949, Hinman had abandoned his prototype for a completely redesigned collator, though a few more years of tinkering would pass before he would consider the device perfected (Altick 188; Hinman, “Variant Readings” 280-281). This was the machine he would use to make his study of the First Folio [plate 5]. Within a few weeks of installing it at the Folger, he had already collated his way through “18 formes” that included “the whole of Othello and parts of Lear and of Anthony and Cleopatra ” in all of the Library's copies of the volume (Hinman, “Mark III” 150). Though his work was interrupted for two more years when he was called back to military service for the Korean conflict, in 1951 he was able to report the results of these collations, thus laying the first stone in the scholarly monument that would come to be considered an “irreplaceable landmark in Shakespeare studies” (Blayney 5). At the end of 1952 he was back at the Folger, and the next year he announced that his new tool was, more or less, complete (Hinman, “Variant Readings” 280).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3 Tanselle's article also provides the best overview of the issues surrounding the debate over bibliography and science. 4 A receipt at the Folger Library in Hinman's hand indicates that he was reimbursed for the “transportation” of a stereoscope from “PIC.” There is nothing in the note or the rest of the file that identifies “PIC” (Hinman, Autograph). I have found no further information on Hinman's use or study of this device. However, stereoscopes were used in the interpretation of aerial photographs during World War II, though not to analyze before and after shots in the manner that Hinman explained. An aerial photograph taken from directly overhead presents a very unnatural view; because the objects pictured appear flat, they are difficult for a viewer to recognize. Military photo-analysts used the stereoscope to view two photographs, slightly offset from one another, taken consecutively along the line of flight or simultaneously from different cameras in the same plane. This created the 3-D effect that had made the device such a popular parlor novelty. It also gave the images contour and thus made them much easier for the analysts to interpret (Stanley 265-270). Neither Hinman nor anyone else ever mentioned the stereoscope as one of his influences. The principles behind the device have been used by his successors, and for more information on this as well as other applications see note 8. 5 In his 1947 report on the collator, Hinman stated that William Jackson told him that “such a device was nearly perfected at Harvard several years ago. Wartime shortages stopped work on it before it could be put into operation” (“Mechanized Collation: A Preliminary Report,” 105). On the face of it, this statement seems to suggest that yet someone else was working on mechanical collation before Hinman. We know about Willoughby and Bogeng, but neither was working at Harvard, nor were they stopped by wartime shortages. Jackson may have been referring to work that Harvard astronomers were doing with a blink comparator (about which more later in the essay) rather than the application of this technology to the study of books. William H. Bond, who was a graduate student at Harvard before the war, served with Hinman during the conflict, was a Research Fellow with Hinman at the Folger prior to their entering the service, and would return to Harvard after the war and eventually become head of the Houghton Library, is not aware of anyone working on a mechanical collator for bibliographical purposes at Harvard (Bond, Letter). Given Bond's location and his bibliographical interests before and after the war, it would have been very difficult for such efforts to have taken place without his knowledge of them. 6 There was another technique used by World War II codebreakers that is suggestive of mechanical collation. In their efforts to crack the Germans' famous Engima machine, British cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park overlaid perforated cards called “Jeffreys sheets.” The cards recorded different transmissions of the same message translated into perforations. By superimposing these cards on a light table, the codebreakers attempted to spot similarities in the encryption. This technique would have been known to some Americans. Though the assault on the Enigma machine was led by the British, several U.S. service personnel worked with them (Parrish, 112-113). It seems unlikely, however, that Hinman ever saw or used a Jeffreys sheet. According to a fellow member of his intelligence unit, American work on the Enigma machine was done by the Army, not the Navy. He also has no memory of this technique or anything like it in their unit. Their work involved Japanese, not German, code and relied largely on tools no more sophisticated than pencil and paper (Bond, Telephone, 20 July 2001). It is tempting to link this technique to Hinman. So tempting, in fact, that I feel compelled to raise it here largely for the purpose of ruling it out. There is, again, no evidence that Hinman knew anything about Jeffreys sheets, and unless luck or persistence reveals otherwise we must regard them as only coincidental. 7 For example, “The collating machine that supposedly `detects' these compositorial differences was a direct outcome of surveillance techniques in the Second World War” (Masten 8). 8 The blink comparator was itself preceded by an earlier device, the stereo-comparator, which operated according to the principles of the previously mentioned stereoscope. The two devices even share the same inventor in Carl Pulfrich. The blink was apparently an adaptation of the stereo-comparator and both were intended for the same purpose—the comparison of photographs of star fields taken on different dates. But whereas the blink, like the Hinman, utilizes the principle of the stroboscope and signals differences by apparent movement between two images viewed in rapid alternation, the stereo-comparator creates a 3-D effect when the images, viewed simultaneously, do not match. The idea behind the stereoscope would be put to use by some of the Hinman's successors, namely the Lindstrand Comparator in the 1970s, the McLeod Collator in the 1980s, and an even more recent device developed by Carter Hailey (Lindstrand; Zalewski; “Bibliographical Mirrors”). The blink-comparator did not supplant its predecessor. Both have been used effectively by astronomers, their relative merits sometime being the subject of friendly debate (Drummeter). Likewise in the bibliographical world the Hinman was not displaced by the Lindstrand or one of the other stereoscopic collators. Here, too, each device has proven useful, with some bibliographers preferring one over the others. 9 The source of the “rusty Erector set,” incidentally, was Giles Dawson's young son (Bond, Letter). 10 In the early 1980s, Paul R. Sternberg and John M. Brayer returned to the idea of “color differentiation.” They used digital technology to create composite images of pages from the same edition. Instead of distinguishing the differences between the pages by blinking or creating a 3-D effect, their method revealed variations by the use of color, either blue or red depending upon which of the images contained the difference. Though the method had its advantages (one being that since the images were stored in a computer they could be replayed at a later date and another that the technique could “equalize” the images if they were scanned or reproduced at different sizes), their approach was only feasible for the “close examination of a few particular images” and not for large-scale collation projects (Sternberg and Brayer 444). However, a far more serious problem, which is apparent from the illustrations provided with the article, was that the process communicated too much information. In addition to highlighting differences in printing, composite imaging highlighted all the differences—smudges, foxing, flyspecks, stray pen or pencil-marks, imperfections in the paper, etc. The Sternberg and Brayer method emphasized everything equally, and thus typographical differences could very easily be lost in a sea of blue and red. Neither Wyllie nor Hinman mentions this effect in their correspondence, but it is difficult to imagine that they did not also face the same challenge. Sternberg and Brayer have continued their efforts to use digital technology for textual collation, and their most recent efforts are viewable on Sternberg's website (Sternberg). Displayed there are three different approaches to the problem, all of them developed using “off-the-shelf freeware.” One example uses color differentiation, another relies on the stereoscopic or 3-D effect, and yet another tries to recreate on the computer screen the same effect one observes when looking through the viewer of the Hinman. According to Sternberg and Brayer, the “mathematics” underlying each of the programs is still too cumbersome to make any of them practical, and they are now attempting to develop applications based on software of their own design (Sternberg). This technique, along with other descendants of and alternatives to mechanical collation, will be discussed at greater length in a future portion of this study.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II As I hope I have shown, the development of mechanical collation did not occur in isolation. Charlton Hinman rightly deserves credit for the device that bears his name, but as with most inventions its story is one of confluence and collaboration. He drew inspiration and information from many different sources during the research and development phase of his work. The history of the manufacture, promotion, and distribution of the Hinman Collator follows much the same theme. Like characters in the Renaissance plays the machine was invented to study, several different people, organizations, and influences walk on and off the stage, some playing bit parts and others assuming more substantial roles. All of them contribute something to this drama, and thus it seems appropriate as well as illuminating to recognize as many of them as we can before the curtains of history close on them altogether. Hinman credited the Navy, the Veterans' Administration, the Bureau of Standards, the Folger bindery, and Giles Dawson's young son for contributing to the construction of his first machine (“Mechanized Collation: A Preliminary Report” 101). Though Hinman's first experimental collations at the Folger in the summer of 1946 with what he called his “gadget” were encouraging, they also highlighted the machine's shortcomings (Hinman, Letter to John Cook Wylie, 5 Jan. 1947). The main problem was that it worked only with photographic reproductions, which were expensive as well as less reliable than the original documents. A machine that could utilize originals, however, would cost more than the prototype to develop and, technically speaking, would also be considerably more difficult to build. Hinman won a grant from the Old Dominion Foundation to help ease the financial burden (Hinman, “Variant Readings” 280). He met the other challenge by soliciting help from a variety of technical experts, among them Howard Head, aviation engineer and founder of the Head Ski company, and engineers at Johns Hopkins University, where Hinman had taught on the English faculty in the years immediately following the war. Robert P. Rich of the Institute for Cooperative Research at Johns Hopkins worked out the basic design of the optical system (Rich), and Head supervised the overall construction (Hinman, Letter to P. Stewart Macaulay, 9 Jan. 1953). A returning, though less technically expert, contributor was Giles Dawson, who in addition to lending moral support as well as continued access to the Folger's unparalleled collection of First Folios carried on “development” work when Hinman was called away for the Korean war. What exactly Hinman meant by “development” is unclear, though it appears that Dawson's son's toys were spared this time around (“Variant Readings” 280). Ironically, the person most responsible, even more than Hinman himself, for the manufacturing and distribution of Hinman Collators was neither a bibliographer nor a formally trained engineer. Interest in the invention had grown as reports of its progress trickled out from the Folger through the late 1940s. Soon after Hinman's return from his second stint of military service in 1952 it became apparent that there was a demand for his device beyond his own needs. Rather than putting his invention into production, he first considered, again with help from the Old Dominion Foundation, making mechanical drawings available to anyone who needed a machine for non-commercial purposes, the idea being that anyone with access to a “standard machine shop” could build his or her own collator (“Variant Readings” 281). Enter Arthur M. Johnson, a retired naval engineer, who was hired to produce the first set of mechanical drawings [plate 6]. He had offered advice, or, in his own words, “lip service,” at an earlier date, but this was his first hands-on involvement (Johnson, Letter to William P. Barlow, 21 Nov. 1973). Exactly how Johnson and Hinman met is not known, though it seems likely their paths first crossed in the Navy. Johnson went to work for the War Production Board in 1941. Shortly thereafter he was given a commission, serving as a senior engineering officer and technical adviser to the inspector general's office and later as the director of industrial engineering with the Bureau of Ships (“Arthur M. Johnson: Navy Officer, Inventor”). But wherever and however they met is less important than the fact that within a year of producing the first set of drawings, Johnson had begun building collators in partnership with Hinman. A resourceful craftsman and inveterate tinkerer, Johnson was an old-school engineer who got his training on the job rather than in a classroom. His formal education ended with the eighth grade (Alexander Juniewicz, Telephone, 2 Oct. 2000). The shop floors of various tool and machine plants were his high school and his university. The collator was more or less Charlton Hinman's brainchild, but Arthur Johnson provided the manufacturing know-how behind the device. Their first customer was James Ford Bell, book collector and founder of the General Mills Company. The Houghton Library and Lessing J. Rosenwald purchased the next two machines (Johnson, Letter to Joseph Rubinstein, 23 Feb. 1957). When Hinman published an article on the Houghton machine in the Harvard Library Bulletin, more orders came in, the British Museum and the University of Virginia being the next customers to queue up (“Mechanized Collation at the Houghton Library” 132). Hinman held the patent and took the lead in drumming up customers for the first few collators. In 1954 he mailed an “Inquiry to Prospective Subscribers for a Collation Machine” to forty-five libraries and twelve art museums. This was his first and last direct solicitation for business, and his intention was to bring the cost of manufacturing down by building several devices on subscription at the same time, with Johnson as his manufacturer. Johnson had just retired from the Navy and owned Pentagon Products, a specialty tool- and machine-making company in Washington, D.C. In fairly short order, however, Hinman completely turned over the business of making and selling collators to Johnson. 11 Hinman, after all, had more than enough work to do just collating the First Folio, and, after having his research interrupted by two tours of military service, he undoubtedly felt pressure to get on with the work for which he built the collator in the first place. He was in his mid-forties at this point, with an impressive reputation, a project with great promise, and relatively few publications to show for all his effort. The need to fulfill the potential coupled with the passage of time were probably also incentives to clear the decks of all but his main work. There was also a problem with the very first customer that may have discouraged him. James Ford Bell was not pleased with his machine's ability to superimpose images. Apparently no more than three or four lines could be brought into accurate registration at once. Johnson would later argue that none of the early machines was built with the expectation of being able to register an “entire page or area of the capacity of the machine.” Instead, the operator was supposed to “scan an area and move to another area and make minor adjustments” along the way. Harvard and Rosenwald were satisfied with their products, the latter even kicking in a bonus on top of the $1500 sale price. But Bell caused “considerable trouble and delayed payment for some time” (Johnson, Letter to Joseph Rubinstein, 23 Feb. 1957). On his side of the argument, however, he may have had higher expectations than Harvard or Rosenwald because in addition to bookish pursuits he also intended to use the machine in his business, perhaps for the comparison of blueprints at General Mills (Parker). In addition to this and all the other headaches of running a small business, the onset of middle age, and a growing sense of urgency to produce the substantial piece of scholarship the bibliographical world had been waiting for since just after the war, the fact that the first six machines were built at a loss of “several thousand dollars” probably also did not encourage Hinman to stay involved (Johnson, Letter to Joseph Rubinstein, 23 Feb. 1957). But whatever Hinman's reasons for falling back, Johnson was more than happy to march forward. From the early-1950s to the mid-1970s, he built over fifty machines, making many important modifications and improvements along the way. The change from black to bluish-gray flecked metal sides, the installation of a cabinet to conceal the motor, and the addition of chrome trim were all efforts on Johnson's part to improve the physical appearance of the collator. He made changes to improve its performance as well—for example, replacing the sealed beam headlights with 150-watt flood lamps, adding adjustable casters to compensate for uneven floors, upgrading the quality of the mirrors, and eventually replacing the noisy “motor driven cam device that actuated a micro-switch to cause the lights to alternately blink” with a silent electronic circuit board (Johnson, Letter to William P. Barlow). 12 Johnson also had a habit of abandoning a change or improvement at a later date. The University of Kansas collator, for example, was the first and one of only a few to carry three viewing lenses instead of two. The Kansas collator was also the first to have a bluish-gray panel exterior and chrome ornamentation, and while the color stayed nearly the same on subsequent machines, the decoration did not. To help break up the “monotony on the large flat surface above the telescope,” Johnson added two chrome circles with two flat metal strips between them (Johnson, Letter to Joseph Rubinstein, 9 June 1958) [plate 6]. By the time he built the Iowa collator six or seven years later, this rather stylized design was replaced with two simple chrome strips [plate 7]. By the late sixties he had given up on ornamentation altogether, returning to the spare, or monotonous, style of the earliest machines [plate 8]. (No Hinmans, incidentally, ever sported tail fins!) In the beginning Johnson never expected to build more than one collator, and up until the late 1950s he seems to have expected each order to have been the last. But even after he realized a steady demand would continue, the market was not such that it justified mass production and the uniformity that follows therefrom. The first machines were built on order, one at a time, and in later years Johnson usually constructed them in batches of six or so (Michel, Telephone, 28 Sept. 2000). But whether one at a time or in batches, Johnson often took the opportunity to revise his earlier work. Thus like the First Folio itself, no two specimens of the Hinman Collator were ever constructed exactly alike. In addition to manufacturing and improving the apparatus, Johnson also acted as deliveryman and chief promoter. Many people remember Johnson and his wife, Moni, delivering the latest machine on a U-Haul trailer attached to the back of their Cadillac and then making a vacation of the event by touring the area for a few days before heading home. The arrival of a new collator, especially in the early years, was a highly anticipated event and often greeted with fanfare. The Charlottesville Daily Progress and the Richmond Times-Dispatch covered the purchase of the University of Virginia Hinman, and a special demonstration was offered for members of the Bibliographical Society (Vander Meulen 23-25). Ohio State's purchase of a machine made the front page of the student newspaper (Hecht). Reporters from radio, television, and the newspaper covered the arrival of the Texas collator in Austin (Johnson, Letter to Jack Herring, 20 Mar. 1974). And even as late as 1974, when Texas A&amp;M purchased one of the last Hinmans to be manu- factured , library staffers “fell out en masse ” to witness demonstrations of the new “wonder machine” (Chapman). There has always been a mystique about the Hinman Collator, even among individuals who know nothing of and care not one whit about bibliography and textual criticism. A sense of this appeal is apparent in the Richmond Times- Dispatch article mentioned above: There it stood in front of the fireplace in the McGregor Room of the Alderman Library at the University of Virginia—a bulky, box-like metal monster about six feet tall with a row of toggle switches, flashing lights and a generally sinister appearance. Its creator, Charlton Hinman, stood by as if to protect the coven of the Bibliographical Society, gathered in solemn Sabbath, from any hostile gesture on the part of the machine. Here, surely, was Frankenstein Redivivus and a new creature. (Ball) Other reporters also colorfully described the machine and along the way frequently misinterpreted or exaggerated its capabilities. Charlton Hinman once cited a reporter who described the invention as “an electronic machine in which an electric eye reads lines of type and flashes red lights when it comes upon any variation” (Hinman, Six 3). New technology frequently inspires a sense of awe mixed with a healthy dose of heightened expectation. These feelings were perhaps compounded in the Hinman bcause in addition to being new it also represented a unique application of technology to the humanities. Another factor in the Hinman's appeal, and one that is also evident in the Times-Dispatch example, is its sheer impressiveness as a physical object. The Hinman stands just under six feet tall, five feet wide, and in its final form weighed 450 pounds. Its switches, binocular optics, flashing lights, chrome trim, and metal sides gives it an appearance more appropriate to a Buck Rogers movie than a library alcove. Hinman himself called his creation “at once awesome and a little ludicrous” and invoked the name Rube Goldberg in comparison (Hinman, “Mechanized Collation at the Houghton Library” 132). This is a sentiment shared by nearly everyone who has laid eyes on the Hinman, and whether we are awed, amused, or both by the machine, it retains a remarkable ability to fascinate. The design of the Hinman constitutes a wonderful example of late-1940s and 1950s futurism. Its hulking, metal exterior reminds us that it was invented in a great age of rocket ships, robots, and other types of imaginative technology—so much so that one would not be surprised to find it featured on the cover of Astounding Science Fiction or some other futuristic fantasy rag. Nor would it also be completely out of place in the appliance section of a mail order catalog. In the 1950s it looked like a piece of progressive technology ought to look, and Arthur Johnson's improvements both played upon and reinforced this appearance. In our own day the collator so embodies the stereotypical, mid-century machine that many people react to it with a kind of nostalgic amusement, much as they also do to toasters, blenders, and other gadgets of the same vintage. Johnson, like any good salesman, was not above taking advantage of this mystique or of stoking some of the appeal. Showmanship came naturally to him. Two vignettes from Johnson family lore underscore this point. When he delivered one of the machines to England by ocean liner, he often passed the afternoon shooting skeet off the rear deck. His marksmanship abilities were so impressive that he regularly drew throngs of onlookers, and he even worked up a couple of trick shots for their entertainment (Arthur Juniewicz, Telephone). He is also said to have promoted a device he invented to train hunting dogs (about which more in a moment) by occasionally offering impromptu public demonstrations, sometimes in busy urban areas. The device fired a sock in the air by means of a.22 caliber blank. The demonstration always attracted a crowd, and sometimes the attention of a policeman or two, though he was never arrested. His motivation was to cause enough of a stir to get coverage in the local paper, thereby garnering a little free publicity (Michel, Telephone, 28 Sept. 2000). Johnson used these same skills to promote the Hinman. When he sold a collator to Kansas, he suggested holding a reception for the express purpose of pulling a “publicity stunt” (Johnson, Letter to Joseph Rubinstein, 24 June 1958). Six years later, when officials at the University of Texas invited him to give demonstrations of their new machine, he assured them he would be happy to do so for as long as they could supply an “interested audience,” even if that audience consisted of only “one person” (Johnson, Letter to Dorothy Lawrence). Johnson had a standard lecture he offered as part of his delivery package. This “20 to 30 minute” talk explained in “layman's language” the “history of the Hinman Collator, how it came into being... and the success it had with the Works of Shakespeare” as well as “what makes it do what it does.” Moni also lent a hand with these events, helping set up and run a post-lecture “coffee hour and buffet” that the Johnsons offered at their own expense (Johnson, Letter to Jack Herring, 20 Mar. 1974; and Letter to Robert Vosper). The institutions that purchased collators were also not shy about attempting their own “publicity stunts.” For many colleges and libraries, the Hinman provided a means of demonstrating the usefulness and seriousness of the work that went on within their walls, and some of them were quite ambitious in taking advantage of this opportunity. Ohio State may have produced a short promotional film in which the Hinman played the leading role. Entitled “Literary `Detectives' Produce New Hawthorne Edition,” the surviving script sets the film in the Center for Textual Studies and contrasts the old-fashioned means of collation (by “human hand and eye”) with the modern, machineaided method. The last line of narration sums up the work done on the collator as “an important contribution to American literature from the Ohio State campus” (Boyce). 13 The staff of the Newberry Library, home to the Melville edition, did not make a film, but they did place their machine in a location that gave it prominent billing. Located in a glass-fronted room near the main entrance, the Hinman was one of the first things visitors saw on entering the Library. The spectacle of the machine in operation was frequently made all the more interesting by one of the editorial assistants who used it—a nun in full habit (Farren; Krummel). Like any good businessman, Johnson also aggressively attempted to broaden the market by finding new applications for his product. In advertising circulars he proposed uses in fields ranging from photographic analysis to map-making to ballistics. In the mid-1950s he built a tabletop version to help drum up interest in these and other non-book applications. He demonstrated the mini-Hinman to the Air Force and even loaned it out for test runs to their Aeronautical Chart and Information Center in St. Louis, Missouri. He also showed the machine to a group of Wall Street bankers who were looking for a better way to compare signatures on checks and other documents. Neither the Air Force nor the bankers ended up purchasing a Hinman, large or small size. The bankers were “intrigued” and “amazed,” but they also thought the machine would be slower than their current system and require more staff (Johnson, Letter to Joseph Rubinstein, 26 Dec. 1957). Likewise the Air Force enjoyed the show, but in the end determined they needed a device that could compare photographs of objects that varied by as much as 50% in size (Johnson, Letter to Joseph Rubinstein, 9 June 1958). Johnson was undaunted by these rejections, however, and eventually did achieve some success in finding non-book applications. He sold about nine machines to pharmaceutical companies where they were used to proofread labels (Johnson, Letter to Jack Herring, 23 Nov. 1973). The CIA purchased a machine, presumably to detect forgeries. 14 The Royal Canadian Mounted Police borrowed the collator at the University of New Brunswick for the same purpose (Gair). And to this day a graphic design company in Syracuse, New York, uses a Hinman on a weekly basis as a proofreading aid (Brockway). In his promotion efforts, however, Johnson sometimes made claims that, at best, stretched the Hinman's capabilities. At worst, they suggest that he may not have fully understood the original application of the machine he did so much to improve and distribute. One wonders, for instance, how the collator could have, as Johnson claimed in early promotional material, been used to compare bullets “to determine if a certain gun was used” (“Blink Collator Specifications”). One also wonders why he thought the machine would be suitable for the comparison of handwritten signatures, which, though similar, are not identical enough from occurrence to occurrence to make their examination on the Hinman effective. These examples could be chalked up to over-optimism on the part of an eager salesman. His garbled understanding of Hinman's use of the machine is another matter, however. He stated in his advertising brochure: “The development herein described was first applied at the Shakespearean Library in Washington, D.C. for proofreading all of the printings of the works of Shakespeare back to the first folios or originals to detect the many typesetting errors that have taken place through the many years of printing. It was estimated that this job would require forty man years and would necessitate personnel with the ability to read accurately Old English print and thoroughly understand Elizabethan English” (Johnson, Hinman Collator [1972?] 4 ). Johnson, of course, knew the collator was made to compare identical or nearly identical objects, but he does not seem to have fully comprehended its exact bibliographical purpose. His statement that Hinman invented the device to study “all of the printings” of Shakespeare back to the “first folios” implies that the machine is capable of cross-edition collation. A few institutions purchased the machine with this expectation in mind. They were disappointed. Some of the misunderstanding that accompanies the mystique can be attributed to the fact that the Hinman represented a new and exotic technological application. A good deal of it no doubt also derives from the simple fact that the field of bibliography and textual criticism itself is not well understood. But Johnson must also bear some of the blame, for his efforts to promote the Hinman sometimes only promoted confusion about it. When Johnson took up the cause of mechanical collation he was fifty years old and on the verge of semi-retirement. He left the Navy in 1953 and around 1955 sold Pentagon Products, having built the first six machines under that name. When he received inquiries from the University of Kansas in 1957 to build the seventh machine, he considered sub-contracting the job to the Polytronic Company, the firm to whom he had sold his business. By the time the order came through, however, he decided to hire his old shop foreman, Fred W. Buser, and build the machine himself (Johnson, Letter to Joseph Rubinstein, 23 Feb. 1957). Another worker to join the team about this time was Robert Michel, whose father had worked for Johnson at the Bureau of Ships (Michel, Telephone, 28 Sept. 2000). Arthur M. Johnson, Inc., the company name under which most Hinmans would be built, was born, and Johnson would spend the rest of his life in the business of making and selling mechanical collators. The Hinman was not Johnson's only product, however. Nor was it by a long shot his most profitable. In 1961 he patented the “Target Projecting Device Utilizing a Can and a Blank Cartridge.” Under the less cumbersome name of the “Targeteer,” Johnson developed and marketed this device as a poor man's skeet shooter, which instead of clay pigeons launched empty beer cans. Johnson was an expert marksman and avid hunter. The idea for the launcher occurred to him while taking pot shots at beer cans tossed from the front porch of his cabin on an otherwise uneventful hunting trip. Johnson reportedly sold over two hundred thousand Targeteers, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch being his biggest customer (Michel, Telephone, 28 Sept. 2000; Alexander Juniewicz, Telephone, 2 Oct. 2000). Always one to make the most of a good idea, he later developed the Targeteer into the device for training hunting dogs mentioned earlier. The “Retriev-R-Trainer” fired a sock in the air in simulation of a duck or quail shot out of the sky. The launching device, a .22 caliber blank, also served to accustom the dogs to the sound of gunfire. The Hinman Collator never did for Johnson's bank account what the Targeteer and the Trainer did. On the other hand, though Johnson said he lost money on the first five or six, he seems to have at least broken even from the late 1950s on. The collators certainly subsidized trips throughout the United States and Europe. Nevertheless, one cannot help but wonder to what extent the Hinman, and in turn the wider world of bibliography and textual criticism, was underwritten by dog training devices and beer can launchers. In 1973, Johnson wrote that he had poured his “life's blood into the development and building” of collators “for more than twenty years” (Johnson, Letter to William P. Barlow). At that time he was seventy-one. A year earlier he had “partially retired” again, which seems to mean only that he entered into an agreement with a small firm, MICO Engineering, owned by his longtime employee, Robert Michel, that relieved Johnson of the burden of production though he still retained responsibility for “quality... correspondence, delivery, etc.” (Johnson, Letter to E. F. Newland). He retained these responsibilities until the end of his life. In August 1977, he sent a dunning notice from MICO to the Herzog August Bibliothek (Johnson, Letter to Herzog August Bibliothek). In July they had taken delivery of a machine and were moving a little slower than he liked in paying the bill. Johnson died from a heart attack three months later. Ironically, Charlton Hinman had also passed away that year, just seven months earlier in March (Andrews, “Remembering”; Bowers, “Charlton Joseph Kadio Hinman”). A few more machines were sold after Johnson's death, the last one to Penn State in 1979. Around 1980, Bausch and Lomb stopped making the binocular viewers and Michel was unable to find another supplier. There was not enough demand to warrant the expense of tooling up to make the optics himself or to justify the trouble of trying to convince another company to go into production. In 1986 Michel retired and closed his business (Michel, Telephone, 15 July 2000). Though Johnson's role in the spread of mechanical collation was singular, it was not solitary. Other people and organizations also played important parts. Hinman himself, despite having withdrawn from the business, did not cease to influence demand for his invention. His masterpiece of analytical bibliography, The Printing and Proof-reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963), underscored the value of machine collation. The publication of the Norton facsimile of the First Folio five years later did the same. The results of his research had been anxiously awaited for many years. On the appearance of Printing and Proof-reading, nearly every reviewer mentioned the importance of the collator to the project. Though the number and nature of the variants in the First Folio were less spectacular than Hinman had anticipated, the conclusions that he reached based on them seemed all the more remarkable for that very paucity. Frank Kermode spoke for nearly everyone who had an interest in the matter when he described Hinman's study as “a brilliant and protracted piece of laboratory work” (Kermode). This attention did not go unobserved by Johnson, who had also been anxiously awaiting the day when Hinman's research would see light. A year before the publication of Printing and Proof-reading, Johnson was citing its impending appearance as proof of the “value” of his product (Johnson, Letter to William B. Todd, 13 Sept. 1962). From about 1952 to 1962, twelve collators were built and sold. From 1963 to 1968, the five years bordered by the publication of Hinman's two books, over twenty were produced. All through the 1950's, Hinman had been publishing partial and preliminary accounts of his research in Studies in Bibliography and the Shakespeare Quarterly. Clearly these as well as his books gave a boost, albeit indirectly, to the business of which he was no longer a part. During this period other scholars were also setting an example for the bibliographical world. William H. Bond was the first person after Hinman to publish research based on the collator. He was also the first to use the machine on a post- Renaissance text and to analyze non-verbal matter. In 1956, his examination of the illustrations in the 1865 and 1866 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland appeared in the Harvard Library Bulletin. The next year, Matthew J. Bruccoli's investigation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise demonstrated the applicability of machine collation to twentieth-century books. His study was also the first to use the Hinman on an American book. Bruccoli, then still a graduate student at the University of Virginia, used that school's machine to compare a copy of the Scribner's first edition with a 1954 Scribner's reprint from the same plates. He was encouraged in this project by John Cook Wyllie. In 1958, again with Wyllie's encouragement, Bruccoli published a similar account of Sinclair Lewis' Babbitt. Fredson Bowers used the same machine for the Centenary edition of Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter (Ohio State University, 1962). Under his direction, eight copies of the first edition (1850) were collated as well as multiple copies of the second and third editions (Bowers, “Old Wine” 10). These, however, were all preludes to the symphony. None of them was as influential, or as anticipated, as Hinman's two books. In addition to Arthur Johnson, Charlton Hinman, and others, the collator also had an important institutional advocate. The same year that Printing and Proof- reading appeared, the Center for Editions of American Authors (CEAA) was founded by the Modern Language Association. The Center's initial purpose was simply to coordinate and initiate projects and to encourage responsible editorial practices. Its degree of influence and range of activities greatly increased when the program received funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1965. Thereafter, in addition to dispensing significant research funds, the Center also issued a manual of procedures, published a semi-regular newsletter, sponsored exhibitions, and, perhaps most memorably, awarded a seal of approval for display in qualified volumes. In what can be regarded as the Center's founding document, William M. Gibson and Edwin H. Cady singled out the use of the Hinman on the centenary Hawthorne as an indication of high editorial standards. They also optimistically speculated that the machine would soon become more widely available (Gibson and Cady 2-3). A preliminary mimeographed version (1966), the first formal edition (1967), and the “Revised Edition” (1972) described machine collation as nothing less than an editorial “obligation” 11, 6, and 2, respectively). The publications of the Center would continue to extol the virtues of mechanical collation, and scholars who followed this encouragement soon found a new purpose for the machine. The editors of many critical editions learned by hard experience that the volumes they were producing were subject to the same foibles of printing as the works they were studying. James B. Meriwether reported that the printer for the William Gilmore Simms project had a habit of resetting lines where “there had been no error” without being asked and, worse yet, without telling anyone. Such “uncalled for resetting” was particularly worrisome when it occurred after the very last set of proofs had been read (Meriwether 17)! Uncovering variants is part of a textual editor's job; introducing a new one is his or her bane. To combat this problem, Meriwether, David Nordloh, and others began to collate the succesive versions of their proof pages on the Hinman. This extra step, at first seen as little more than a bit of “preventive medicine,” proved so effective in catching last-minute errors that the CEAA eventually made it standard practice for all approved editions (Nordloh 18; and Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures 13). By 1973, seventy volumes of critical editions from works by a dozen American authors had been published under the guidelines of the CEAA and another thirty were in press (Bruccoli, “Note” 28). In varying degrees, all of these projects made use of mechanical collation. Funding from the CEAA also helped establish textual centers at universities throughout the United States, most of which acquired Hinmans. The University of South Carolina, home to the Simms edition and headquarters for the CEAA after 1969, eventually purchased two. The study of Renaissance texts, and specifically the First Folio of William Shakespeare, had inspired the building of the first collator. However, thanks to the CEAA, many more works by American authors of the nineteenth century were subjected to scrutiny under the Hinman's “electric eye” than were works from any other nation or period. The personalities behind the Hinman should also not be overlooked in accounting for its early and lasting prominence. The two principal figures, Charlton Hinman and Arthur M. Johnson, each played different but important and crucially complementary roles. Charlton Hinman, the urbane and eminently learned Rhodes Scholar and Reserve Naval Commander, lent academic and moral credibility to the machine. His credentials were impeccable and his reputation beyond reproach. His devotion to scholarship was amply demonstrated by his taking the time to invent the machine in the first place and then reinforced by his spending the better part of a decade (more or less all of the 1950s) analyzing what it revealed. For most of that time he supported himself on grants, sequestered in the Folger Library like some bibliographical version of a Trappist monk, isolating himself from many of the normal demands (e.g. teaching and students) and pleasures (e.g. teaching and students) of academic life. A sense of Hinman's standing in the scholarly world is shown in the fact that even while he was still working out the kinks and well before the collator would really be proven useful, Richard Altick described it as “the most ingenious gadget yet devised for the aid of literary scholarship” in the first edition of his popular Scholar Adventurers (Altick 186). And then there was Art Johnson, the self-taught engineer with a huckster's gift for showmanship. In many ways he was the man behind the curtain, for over the long term he was the one pulling the strings, manning the bellows, and sounding the whistles. Their efforts were neither coordinated nor premeditated, but all the same they made a potent combination in promoting the spread and use of the machine. Arthur Johnson provided the manufacturing know-how. His promotional efforts also helped enlarge the market for the machine, and the research done using it by Charlton Hinman as well as Bond, Bruccoli, and Bowers inspired others to go and do likewise. The CEAA provided the funding to underwrite projects and set up centers in which the machine was employed. It also made mechanical collation an essential step in the editorial process. One cannot discount the innate appeal of the machine as a physical object in accounting for some of the fascination with it. All of these factors are important in helping us understand how and why the machine was used, but none of them (collectively or individually) completely explains the demand for it. The single most important factor is simply that the collator filled a need, namely, to make relatively fast and efficient comparisons of multiple copies of texts from the same edition or printing. No one would have used or bought one if it could not do this, and in serving this function the machine also created further demand by encouraging a kind of work that was not possible before its invention. As the authors of the CEAA's 1966 Statement noted, the development of the collator contributed to the “drive among contemporary scholars to produce full, highly accurate texts of the writings of major American writers” (3). Just as the types of physical structures we build are often determined by the tools we own, so are the kinds of scholarly projects we engage in affected by the scholarly tools at our disposal. Moreover, the kind of information the machine detected, typographical as well as other printed variations, has proven exceptionally useful for the purposes of analytical bibliography, where the emphasis has always been on printed matter. Additional clues, such as those derived from bindings, watermarks, and other features of the book, have been put to good use, but none to better and more regular application than the discovery of typographical variants. Thus, Charlton Hinman, the numerous scholars who followed him, the CEAA, and Arthur M. Johnson, Inc., owe as much to the Hinman as the Hinman owes to them. Again, collation in itself was not a new idea, but relatively fast and accurate collation on a large scale was. The invention of the Hinman opened up a path of inquiry that could not have been pursued without its aid. This factor more than any other accounts for the demand that fueled the building and distribution of machines. The theory that encouraged the machine's invention in the first place and provided much of the underpinning for its use would eventually be questioned, and these questions led to changes in attitudes and practice that would dampen enthusiasm for mechanical collation. Furthermore, starting in the mid-1960s, smaller and less expensive devices for collating texts were introduced to the field, and one of these, the Lindstrand Comparator, would eventually compete with the Hinman, albeit in a contracted market. However, from the early 1950s, when the machine was first commercially manufactured, well into the 1960s, the Hinman stood unrivaled and largely unquestioned. APPENDIX Current Locations of Surviving Hinman Collators I am currently compiling a chronological census of Hinman Collators. It will attempt to account for every machine constructed and to incorporate details such as sale price, date of acquisition, the projects associated with a particular machine, previous locations for those few machines that have had multiple owners or have been used at different institutions, and other matters of interest. Though the full census is not ready for publication, I believe I have established the whereabouts of all surviving machines. Since it might be helpful for scholars engaged in editorial projects or bibliographical investigations to know these locations, and since the completion of the entire census would mean delaying the availability of this information for some time, it seems useful to make a list of current sites available now. I should caution that not all of the machines listed below are necessarily available for use. Anyone having need of a Hinman is encouraged to make inquiries well in advance of traveling to one. Not mentioned here are locations in three previously published lists by Arthur Johnson that are no longer relevant, either because the machines at those sites have been lost or deaccessioned, or because they were misattributed in the first place. 15 CALIFORNIA Davis, Special Collections, University Library, University of California Los Angeles, Clark Library, University of California Oakland, privately owned by William P.

      <field name="fulltext">11 In 1963, Johnson told William B. Todd that Hinman had transferred the patent for the collator to him (Johnson, Letter to William B. Todd, 18 Oct. 1963). I have been unable to confirm this in the patent records. In 1968, Johnson paid Hinman $1000.00 to “release Arthur M. Johnson personally, Corporation [sic], or any other person, persons, or manufacturing firm of any further obligation in the way of royalties, patents, or commissions on all future sales of the Hinman Collator” (Johnson, Typescript). Despite this agreement, however, for some years thereafter Johnson voluntarily paid Hinman a $100.00 commission on each collator sold for “rare book use” (Johnson, Letter to Charlton Hinman, 21 Apr. 1972). These payments were made in recognition of Hinman's “fair and liberal treatment” in the early days of their relationship and to acknowledge the many inquiries that Hinman had passed on to Johnson over the years. Johnson lost money early on, and thus Hinman waived any royalty or payment on the first few machines (Johnson, Letter to Charlton Hinman, 19 Feb. 1970). 12 Johnson states in this letter that the “silent” electronic circuit board had been in place for about nine years. This would indicate that the first “non-clicking” machine was produced around 1964. Since I have not been able to examine each collator personally, I cannot say which was the first machine to feature this improvement. Whether a Hinman “clicked” in operation, however, was an important distinction for many who used the machine. The non-clicking models were considered more up-to-date, and thus preferable to the earlier machines. 13 John Manning provided invaluable assistance in tracking down the details on this matter. A script for the film survives in the Department of Special Collections at Ohio State University (Boyce). In the 1960s, OSU maintained an ambitious film program for promotional purposes. The Department of News and Information Services produced scripts highlighting various campus programs and offered them for production to local news stations. Sometimes the scripts were picked up and made into short films and sometimes not. This seems to have been the impetus for the Hinman script, which indicates a running time of less than three minutes. Robert Boyce was one of its authors. He does not remember whether the film was ever made. I have been unable to locate a copy in the OSU archives or at any of the local news stations. John Manning, again, did all of the on the ground searching for me at OSU. I am very grateful to him for his efforts. It now seems unlikely that the film was produced. No one that we have located remembers it. However, whether or not the film was made, the fact that OSU went as far as to write and circulate a script shows that institutions were interested in making the most of the Hinman for promotional purposes. 14 Despite numerous attempts, I have been unable to extract any information from the CIA about their use of this machine. No doubt such information is classified. Robert Michel, who worked for Johnson building collators and later took over their manufacture under the company name MICO Engineering, told me an interesting story about this machine. Apparently the CIA instructed Johnson to deliver its order to an inconspicuous loading dock, where an anonymous individual paid him in cash and, instead of having Johnson unload the collator, instructed him to merely detach and leave the U-haul trailer with the machine still on it. Though Johnson had rented the trailer himself, he was never asked to return it or settle the bill; apparently these details were resolved for him (Michel, 15 July 2000). According to Johnson's relatives, a few years later he heard from the CIA again. As Johnson told the story, they were inquiring about the purchase of a new machine because the first one had been stored in a location so secret that even the CIA could not find it (Arthur Juniewicz, 29 Sept. 2000). 15 [Hinman Collators in current use]; “Hinman Collators: Present Locations”; “Locations of Hinman Collators.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* I would like to thank Jim Harner, Maura Ives, John Manning, Larry Mitchell, David Vander Meulen, William P. Williams, and the readers for Studies in Bibliography for their help in bringing this essay to fruition. Their careful and thorough comments on the various manuscript versions of this essay have greatly improved the finished product. I especially appreciate John Manning, who in addition to reading and commenting on the manuscript provided invaluable help in clarifying some of the history of the Hinman at Ohio State University. Many other people have also offered assistance and insight, as the footnotes and the list of works cited amply attest. I thank them. Mistakes, of course, should be attributed only to me. 1 The number fifty-nine is based on my research for a complete census of Hinman Collators. The census is not yet ready for publication. However, I provide a list of current locations of surviving machines as an appendix to this essay. 2 The descendants and alternatives will be discussed at length in a future portion of this study.

      <field name="fulltext">Nobis et ratio et res ipsa centum codicibus potiores sunt. —Richard Bentley</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There are editors destitute of this discriminating faculty, so destitute that they cannot even conceive it to exist; and these are engaged in a task for which nature has neglected to equip them. What are they to do? Set to and try to learn their trade? that is forbidden by sloth. Stand back and leave room for their superiors? that is forbidden by vanity. They must have a rule, a machine to do their thinking for them. If the rule is true, so much the better; if false, that cannot be helped: but one thing is necessary, a rule. —A. E. Housman 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I've enjoyed putting this paper together, for it's allowed me to play my way through the large data sample assembled on The Canterbury Tales Project CD- ROM. 2 I want to examine a single reading and passage from Project's `The Wife of Bath's Prologue'. From the CD-ROM images, I have assembled data and checked it off against explanatory materials published on the disk and/or published in the Project's Occasional Papers. A long series of human experiences has taught me that I can take this reading and passage as exemplary (i.e., other passages I could have chosen would produce the same results, if not perhaps the same clarity of presentation).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I begin with a single lection, the Wife's question at D 115-117—in the form of the Project's base for collation:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Telle me also to what conclusioun</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Were membres maad of generacioun</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And of so parfit wys a wight ywroght?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From the CD-ROM, I've collected the ten most important manuscripts in the textual tradition, the four great early independent copies Hg El Gg Ha 4 , the exemplary representatives of Manly and Rickert's four large constant groups Dd (spot-checked against En 1 ) Ne Cp Pw, and the two important later independent copies Ad 3 Ch. 3 These read:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hg And of so parfit wys a wight ywroght [= Ad 3 Ch] El And for what profit was a wight ywroght Gg And for what profyt was a wyf Iwrouʒt Ha 4 And in what wise was a wight ywrouʒt Dd And of so parfyt wyse a wyght Iwrought [= En 1 ] Ne And of so parfit vice a wiʒt ywrouʒt Cp And of so parfyt wise and why ywrought Pw And of so parfit wise and whi ywrouʒt</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leaving aside some other, mostly explicable variation, these suggest (especially in the context of the Project editors' outspoken veneration of the Hengwrt manuscript Hg) 4 that the Project's edited text of the line should be identical with Hg. Here I am particularly concerned with one word in this textus receptus, the penultimate `wight'.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">`Wight' appears unexceptionable, the reading of thirty-one witnesses in all. Next most widely dispersed is the peculiar (and peculiarly anacoluthonic) Cp Pw variant `and why'; it is found in sixteen witnesses. Elsewhere one finds only: thyng Py; (that) were Bw, were Nl; and how Sl 1 ; wright Ld 2 Ln Ry 2 ; the phrase is omitted in Ii, and the whole line in En 2 He. The majority of all copies and the overwhelming evidence of those most usually trusted emphatically support `wight' as Chaucer's reading.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Unfortunately, there are two difficulties with this analysis, ably signalled years ago by E. Talbot Donaldson. 5 In his classic discussion of the line, which I here summarise, Donaldson demonstrated that:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(a) The word `wight' is not grammatical in this utterance; it cannot, in Middle English, refer to the deity, who is not a `thing'. To Donaldson's showing, one might add a reference to the modern word `not', low-stress variant of `nought', a derivative of the Old English compound `nā-wiht' `nothing'.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(b) The Wife happens at this point, as frequently, to be translating literally, in this case Jerome's rhetorical question from Adversus Iovinianum 1.36: `Et cur, inquies, creata sunt genitalia, et sic a conditore sapientissimo fabricati sumus...?' 6 Latin `conditor', regularly used in British Latin as a term for `God the creator', originally means `the builder/founder of a city', i.e., with the reinforcement of Jerome's `fabricati sumus', a carpenter or `wright' (cf. the modern surname `Wright', equivalent to `Carpenter', or such related onomastic forms as `Cartwright' and `Wheelwright').</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What's going on here? The Canterbury Tales Project editors have done, by their lights, everything right and, as a consequence, have it all wrong. There is no family-tree principle, equitably and rationally applied, which can construe the reading of the isolated Ld 2 Ln Ry 2 as the reading of O, the copy provided the archetypal scribe(s) of Chaucer's `Wife of Bath's Prologue'. And yet that reading is, on the basis of all the evidence, most assuredly what Chaucer did write. One does not learn that from a machine or rule, but precisely on the basis of what Bentley calls `ratio' and Housman `discriminating faculty'—in this case Donaldson's thought, that of a distinguished philological scholar who knew his languages and was expert in applying them to a text and textual situation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Moreover, an analysis of this variation should further undermine one's confidence that a `machine' might generate anything like `the truth' here—or anywhere else in `The Wife of Bath's Prologue' or The Canterbury Tales. Consider, that is meditate upon, think about, the various possible explanations for this situation. I present these as two opposed logical possibilities, but the bottom line, if you adopt either view (and I think you have to choose one), will be the same—`The Wife of Bath's Prologue' (and by extension, The Canterbury Tales ) is not an appropriate text to treat by mechanistic processes of textual criticism.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(a) My first possibility I introduce by directing your attention to Peter Robinson's cladistic diagramme of the manuscript relations at this point in the text. 7 This shows, a finding I'd be well disposed to accept, that at least eight copyings must separate the common source Robinson postulates for the three manuscripts Ld 2 Ln Ry 2 from Chaucerian draft O. That is to say, the three MSS are related, their archetype was a copy extremely advanced in the chain of transmission, and thus there is every reason to expect that the archetype from which it received its text resembled the majority at this point, that it might have contained the majority reading I have already identified, following Donaldson, as erroneous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In this scenario, whatever the scribe of the Ld 2 Ln Ry 2 exemplar did, he did not follow the reading of his exemplar. Rather, he imported a reading from elsewhere, either by consultation of another manuscript or by a lucky guess—an act which he performed because he recognized what is abundantly clear from nearly half the tradition, the twenty-five copies that do not transmit the reading `wight', that the text did not make sense in Middle English. (While I am absolutely certain that a number of the scribal teams behind several of the ten manuscripts I have cited in full knew Jerome, Chaucer's source-text, I am equally certain that none of them ever used it to spot-check the Wife's Prologue, a behaviour to be contrasted with several scribes in Manly-Rickert's b tradition who did in fact collate and `correct' `Chaucer's Tale of Melibee' against copies of its French source.) 8 The technical term for any of these activities is `conflation', and its discovery, on such a random basis anywhere in a variant sample, indicates that no single reading anywhere in the tradition can be taken as evidence for genetic descent on any basis other than raw faith.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(b) As a logical alternative, I examine another scenario, that the three scribes are in fact reporting precisely what their exemplar—and its exemplar —read. In this regard, one might consider the quality of variation which typifies the group of three manuscripts with `wright' and assess the possibility that they (or their exemplars) would have made a brilliant guess or sought aid by consultation of multiple copies. For this purpose, I've simply sampled their readings in sixteen lines surrounding the line under discussion (D 110-125). On this basis, I see no reason to dissent from Robinson's published views on this flavour of the text; he comments generally, `the character of these variants suggests scribal carelessness', and concludes by saying `th[is] version of the text... is the result of scribal carelessness and tinkering'. 9 In other words, these scribes (and their forebears) weren't brilliant and are most likely to have copied what they saw, or to have trivialised, not improved it. (I note in passing that the judgement that the scribes in this tradition were `careless' or `tinkerers' speaks only to the general quality of variation visible in their copies and does not preclude their having, in any individual instance, transmitted an accurate text—as they indeed do in the majority of lemmata.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To follow out this logic, one must consider the thirty-one souls who wrote `wight' in their manuscripts. The Canterbury Tales Project will print this reading because it is so plainly not genetically bound: in my citations above, it appears as the reading in three of the four great early independent copies, in the Manly-Rickert constant groups a and b, and in two later independent copies of value. Excepting Cp and Pw (to which I will return), every one of these copies appears in the Canterbury Tales Project stemma (indeed, in any stemma one would construct, should one want to) closer to Chaucerian materials than the exemplar of La 2 Ln Ry 2 . Hg was potentially derived directly from a version of O (although not, I would think, the same O available elsewhere in the tradition); 10 Ch and Ad 3 , here following exemplars related to Hg, second and third generation copies; Dd and El fifth generation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quite simply, if `wright' was licitly, i.e. by vertical descent through exemplars, available in the eighth generation of copying, it was also available somewhere in every previous copying generation. Thus, the exemplars of some substantial number of the thirty-one fellows who wrote `wight' in D 117 must also have read in their copy `wright', and they must have failed to communicate the reading that was before them in their copy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One can meditate, think, a little as to why this might be so, and the answers will have very little to do with any outright scribal culpability. Of course, it is possible that many scribes simply saw `wright', didn't get it, and chose a word of similar shape they hoped would be communicative in context. This is, of course, `the substitution of homologous similars' (as opposed to that `of semantic similars').</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But equally, inadvertence and accident might have had their role. No one reads whole words; we all make approximative guesses on the basis of a general graphemic shape. A good many scribes may have seen `w' as the front, `ght' at the end, identified the word as `wight', and copied it as such. Or alternatively, euphony may have been an issue. Scribes take up a unit to copy visually, repeat it to themselves as they transcribe, and write letters as they hear themselves speak them. In such a process `wright iwrought' may have been a bit of a tongue-twister and just accidentally have got heard (and copied) in dissimilated form, `wight iwrought'. Or finally, memorial contamination might be at issue. Given the `bespoke' conditions under which English books were produced until the 1460s, no copyist of this work was ever a virgin; all of them knew the text already, and the text they knew may have overridden in their copying whatever they saw before them in their exemplar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As a consequence, the weight of evidence here means very little. In this second argument, there is every possibility that majority attestation for `wight' may be thoroughly accidental. Given the variety of ways in which this error might be made, it might be made over and over again, in various circumstances, with the effect that readings everywhere in the tradition converge in error. But these are not errors genetically transmitted; they are rather perfectly independent innovations. If this is the case, apparent genetic dispersion of a reading may mean nothing other than that, when faced with the same reading, scribes are thoroughly capable of multiplying the same error.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No branching tree model of transmission is prepared to deal with `convergence', for it is not the vertical procedure branching trees outline. Finding it potentially prevalent anywhere in a textual tradition renders that tradition not susceptible to genetic treatment. This then is another situation which undermines the possibility of Housman's `machine', a genetic analysis of the variant sample. In short, Peter Robinson deserves congratulations for a stunning and irrefutable discovery: in the effort to edit `The Wife of Bath's Prologue' genetically, through cladistic analysis, he has shown the futility of the `machine'-task he has constructed. For one or the other of my logical propositions must be true—either the archetype of Ld 2 Ln Ry 2 included the reading `wright' transmitted by these manuscripts licitly, by genetic descent, or it did not. If the second is the case, stemmatic procedures are inapplicable because of conflation; if the first, because of convergence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Indeed the cladistic diagramme Robinson has prepared for this portion of `The Wife of Bath's Prologue' enshrines convergent variation as the normal state of affairs. Here I return to `wright' and its variation; although thirty-one copies read `wight', sixteen have instead `and why', the two I have already cited (Cp Pw), as well as Dl Fi Gl Ha 2 La Lc Ld 1 Mg Mm Ph 3 Ry 1 Se Sl 2 To. In Robinson's diagramme, which indicates general agreement throughout the first 390-400 lines of the text, these sixteen copies cluster; fifteen constitute the majority of a group of twenty, all ultimately dependant on a single ninth-generation copying of `The Wife of Bath's Prologue'.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This is, in itself, not particularly surprising, for this is simply Robinson's rendition of Manly and Rickert's constant group cd*. But surprising in the diagramme is the position of Cp and Pw. This group began, as I have noted, with a ninth-generation copy; Robinson presents Cp as fifteenth-generation and Pw as thirteenth. In other words, they are well down the stemmatic tree—in fact at its very foot—among the most subject to variation and most deviant of all copies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philological knowledge made Donaldson think; codicological knowledge occasionally stimulates me. From any codicological point of view, this is a surprising finding. The overwhelming majority of the copies here grouped are manuscripts of c. 1450-80; the exceptions are precisely Cp and Pw. The first is among the very oldest copies of the poem, probably predating 1410, written by a prolific and important individual, `early London scribe D'. He seems to have had, unusually for early Canterbury Tales scribes, a full and assembled copy of the poem to work from (Manly-Rickert's c). This set of archetypes remained as an organised unit for perhaps a decade, passing on to Pw, who edited portions of them (presumably only those for which he could find a second copy, not the Wife of Bath's performance). 11 The result of this activity, Manly-Rickert's d, was a textual source widely used in the later fifteenth century, in fact the source that most of the other fourteen scribes who wrote `and why' are drawing on in D 117. From an historical perspective, this portion of Robinson's diagramme is `upsodoun'; the antecedent sources of the group appear at its foot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But this state of affairs only occurs, as I have suggested above, because of the laws that govern `machines'. More deviant copies must appear as more advanced in transmission than less deviant ones. And through the sample, the source texts Cp Pw present the poem more variously than those copies which are actually their descendants. One should again think about why this might be the case: quite simply the fourteen manuscripts which appear to precede Cp Pw here do so because they have removed from their texts a number of the distinctive cd readings they received from Cp Pw. They have imported the lections of the tradition at large, and reveal a behaviour common in late forms of textual traditions, what one may call `regression to the commonplace'. 12 But in any event, their superior position in Robinson's tree indicates these copies' failure to rely on readings genetically transmitted; the texts they transmit must, on a general basis, be the result of those activities I have earlier outlined in discussing Ld 2 Ln Ry 2 's `wright'—either conflation (consultation of multiple copies) or accidental convergence with readings elsewhere in the tradition. In either scenario, the `machine' has broken down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One final corollary to this argument—that attestation of no single reading among the manuscripts offers evidence about its authenticity. The thoughtless reversal of this argument—the claim that attestation overrides all other concerns—has been used to `deauthenticate' five scattered passages in `The Wife of Bath's Prologue'. 13 And what is traditionally called `internal evidence', baldly thematic and uncritical readings (as opposed to the `external evidence' that Jerome did write `conditore' and Chaucer translated it aptly), cannot offer any purchase on the question of authenticity. Quite simply, there is no responsible evidence available from the manuscripts to indicate that such spottily attested passages are not Chaucer's, and Housmann's “discriminating faculty' might have suggested that they were Chaucerian on their face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I want to shift to a slightly broader look at `The Wife of Bath's Prologue' now—and perhaps a broader point about thinking and machines. I earlier mentioned that I had validated Peter Robinson's views about the quality of text communicated by Ld 2 Ln Ry 2 (as well by as their congener Bw) through an examination of their variation in a sixteen-line passage. The evidence which I amassed in my survey and by studying relevant portions of Peter Robinson's report on the stemmatic relations of the manuscripts in `The Wife of Bath's Prologue' will offer broader perspectives on the enterprise. 14</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First I must sadly report a technological glitch, strange in this `machine'-driven context, a case of `reinventing the wheel' which compromises Robinson's whole endeavour. He formulates a family F comprising two pairs [(Bw Ln) (Ld 2 Ry 2 )]. Regrettably, whatever one thinks of his results, this formulation renders a good deal of his information on the four manuscripts valueless.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For there are not two pairs here. On the basis of any number of features, Ld 2 is that rare Middle English manuscript which can comfortably be de- scribed as a `codex eliminaturus', a manuscript whose readings are of no evidentiary value whatever, because it has in fact been directly copied from a surviving manuscript, in this case from Ry 2 . 15 Of course the two manuscripts will group as a pair; the only thing which can distinguish their readings is the extra errors which got into the subsequent copying of Ld 2 (and the scribe's innovations which happily corresponded to a right reading somewhere else in the tradition, yet more convergence). But as a result, any judgement Robinson makes predicated on Ry 2 and Ld 2 as separate copies will be invalid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In general, Robinson's showing is predicated on seeking a certain kind of agreement in readings, that is agreement which will testify to grouping as two pairs, apart from all other copies. But he never thinks of submitting the group to the actual test of genetic relationship, that the grouping postulated will explain the preponderance of the evidence. As a consequence, Robinson never gives the full evidence and never cites counterinstances.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the passage I have surveyed, D 110-125, Bw Ln Ld 2 Ry 2 agree in six variations which suggest they might be related genetically (I'm retaining Robinson's identification of Ld 2 as an independent copy). 16 Two of these variants only show Ry 2 readings passed on in Ld 2 (112 `Lordes' for `lordynges', 114 `in' om.). Robinson strangely does not cite one of a further two readings which join all four manuscripts uniquely (in 112, they all omit `And'). (The other, the omission of the phrase 113 `the flour of', appears in his account, but is misreported.) Two other variants, 117 `wright' (again misreported) and 120 `maked' (which does not even appear in the Project's CD-Rom collations but is common to three of the four copies and, strangely, recorded in only two other manuscripts in the whole tradition), are very likely correct readings. They are thus not properly genetic information, although they speak to the isolation of the group of four.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Against these two (conceivably four) variants speaking to a genetic relationship among the four manuscripts, I find in my sample eight counterexamples, two of them mentioned in the Occasional Papers. Robinson rejects the omission of 124 `wel' from his sample on the grounds that it is likely convergent (a capricious case of petitio principii —one undertakes a genetic analysis precisely to measure the degree of covergence among copies—but a pleasant sign that Robinson knows he could edit the text by thinking about it). The second reading, 121 `other', is included as support for the genetic relationship but can only serve this function because Robinson reports its distribution inaccurately—the reading `other' appears in sixteen manuscripts additional to our four and provides no evidence for the group. In the other six instances, one of two situations obtains:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(a) the four manuscripts vary in the form `A B // A C', frequently in agreements with a number of other texts, and no genetic statement is possible, e.g. 117 of (in Ld2)] in Bw, of as interlined correction Ln, om. Ry 2 . Ln's correction is unique, but six further witnesses, including Ry 2 , share its original reading and simply omit. Note that this lection provides yet another example of convergence, the derivative Ld2 having made the same obvious correction as the Ln corrector and brought his text into line with the tradition at large;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">or (b) the reading is so widespread as to provide no genetic information whatever, e.g. 110 foore] lore Ld 2 Ln Ry 2 , as well as thirty-two other copies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So Robinson presents two (maybe four) readings which support a genetic relationship, while offering no comment on eight readings which don't. In other words, as an explanatory tool, in my sample Robinson's reconstruction of the textual relations handles 20%-33% of the variant information available. On this showing, convergent variation constitutes the most normal state of affairs in this textual tradition, and no defensible or usable stemma of `The Wife of Bath's Prologue' can be forthcoming. That is not a showing which ought to instill confidence in the Canterbury Tales Project as an editorial `machine', since I would think one needs to explain at least 75% of the variants genetically, i.e. three for every one you cannot explain, to be convinced you have a stemma useful for editing a text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That the evolutionary biologists from whom Robinson derived his methodology for grouping manuscripts, cladistic analysis, find a 40% showing provocative does not address this querulousness. I am initially bemused by Robinson's choice of tool, a striking form of cyclical `historicism' whereby the post-modern `machine' replicates its archaic origins. For Robinson implicitly appeals to analogy—the development of manuscript traditions should be like the development of species—and in so doing, thoughtlessly replays the same Late Romantic fascinations with origins and organic growth which produced this kind of thinking in the first place. ( Stemma/Stamm/stefn does, after all, mean `tree trunk'.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Simultaneously, I would think the differences between biological cladistics and manuscript traditions more telling than their resemblances. In a general way, the biologists deal with a nonreversible procedure (once a mutation occurs, it doesn't get undone); in contrast, Robinson's whole interest in the branching tree diagramme is predicated on its reversibility, on being able to trace variations backward into the whole unity of origin. But there seem to me more practical difficulties. The biologists are dealing with samples in which variation is random, with in fact a designated measure of randomness (the standard constant of mutation). Moreover, in their samples numerals on the order of 1020 are small numbers. With a literary text, variation has not been generated randomly, but by motivated human activity (which can be comprehended as such by thinking, re-enacting the procedure followed by the human agents). And the order of magnitude, an important consideration in any statistical procedure, for a text the size of `The Wife of Bath's Prologue' is scarcely comparable to that generated in studying variation of amino acids in a protein string or genes on a chromosome—I would estimate for agreements in erroneous readings an order of magnitude of only 10 3 or 10 4 .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Housman points out, thinking is hard and unpleasant. And machines are utterly fascinating and may hold out the hope of some post-modern `scientific objectivity' in the arts. Probably the Wife of Bath should get the last word, in lines Chaucer most assuredly wrote, perhaps as a last word late in the game, perhaps eliminated from much of the manuscript tradition by `notional homeoteleuthon':</field>

      <field name="fulltext">I would suspect that she and Chaucer—echoing the perfectly thoughtful wisdom of the creator in his manufacture of genitalia—meant that, in addition to counting, thinking both while one in-puts and while one reads printout is a very good thing.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">EVIDENCE FOR THE STEMMA OF THE PIERS PLOWMAN B MANUSCRIPTS by Robert Adams</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1918, Elsie Blackman, one of the members of R. W. Chambers's editorial team, published a seminal study of the textual relationships between extant manuscripts of the Piers Plowman B-version. A central hypothesis proposed by Blackman was that an important set of four B manuscripts—Bodleian MS Laud Misc. 581 [L], BL MS Additional 35287 [M], Bodleian MS Rawlinson Poetry 38 [R], and Oxford Corpus Christi MS 201 [F]—comprise a definable sub-family of two pairs (L/M and R/F through simple vertical transmission (500-503). Blackman's proposal was discarded by Kane and Donaldson, who showed convincingly that it misrepresented the actual familial relations between surviving B witnesses. There is no reason to doubt their conclusion that shared readings among these four copies were all the result either of accidental convergence or faithful attestation to their original, the lost B archetype. Unfortunately, the Athlone editors also assumed (perhaps in reaction to Blackman's failed idea) that accidental convergence of readings was so common among the surviving B copies that nothing very reliable or useful could be known about the stemmatic relationships (other than the now-obvious fact that R and F were descended from a different sub-archetype than that which spawned the other manuscripts).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That assumption now appears hasty and overly negative. The massive textual evidence we have been assembling at the Piers Plowman Electronic Archive, in the process of producing documentary editions of all the major B manuscripts, clearly points to a more hopeful and useful conclusion: while Blackman was surely wrong about the existence of an LMRF sub-family, there is every reason to believe that, whenever these four copies agree in a reading (even when contradicted by all other extant witnesses), they are attesting the original text of Bx (Schmidt's term for the B archetype). While there are indications that a few of the surviving B copies derive from more than one intermediary (by change of exemplar at some stage of the copying process), and there is also evidence of sporadic lateral contamination in several (especially F and M, but also probably G), most of what we see suggest unimpeded vertical transmission of the poem's text (see stemma on next page).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although a similar view of the B manuscripts familial relationships was implied by the Kane- Donaldson edition of 1975, a specific sketch of a B stemma similar to ours was first offered in A. V. C. Schmidt's critical text of 1978 (xxxvi). Moreover, it is apparent that, since the publication of his Page 174. Parallel-Text edition in 1995, Schmidt has fully understood the implications of the LMRF evidence that is about to be outlined here (whereas, when I reviewed his edition in 1996 for The Yearbook of Langland Studies, we did not). The differences between the stemma offered above and Schmidt's are, however, worth noting. Leaving aside the mixed text Ms H (BL Harley 3954 = A-version MS H 3 ) and the very late S (originally Sion College MS Arc. L.40 2/E, now Takamiya 1), excluded here because of their limited textual value, the main differences between Schmidt's model of twenty years ago and ours are the following: (1) most of C 2 was apparently copied directly from O and has no independent authority in determining originality of text; (2) the Crowley text (Cr) derives from a manuscript whose closeness to Bx was equal to that of L, M and R and superior to that of any other surviving B manuscript, including the well regarded W and Hm; (3) all beta manuscripts except L and M are descended, at various removes, from Cr's exemplar, which is labelled β 1 in the diagram above; (4) from our work in editing Corpus Christi MS 201, it is apparent that at least one other copy (with dialect features typical of the area southeast of King's Lynn) intervenes between F and the alpha sub-archetype, while R may be directly copied from alpha and is certainly closer to it in all respects than F is; (5) the evidence surviving in M itself attests that, after it was copied, it was proofed against a sibling manuscript of the same generation, presumably the same copy (i.e., β 1 ) later used to produce Cr since a large set of “corrections” in M correspond consistently to Cr along among the other B witnesses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Because of the composite sources of F (with its highly sophisticated and mixed text), the spotty nature of M (not as carefully copied as its sibling, L, and then overlayed with “corrections” from β 1 ), and the massive loss of text near the beginning and end of R, L is clearly the single most authoritative manuscript of the B-version of Piers, just as Skeat recognized more than a hundred years ago (albeit while he was wishing to extend that perception to the mistaken belief that L might have been Langland's fair-copy). When L agrees with R, even in the face of massive dissenting evidence from the other witnesses, the odds are always quite good that what R and L are mirroring is Bx (albeit the readings of that prototypical copy can never be simply equated with authorial text). When both L and M agree with R (and F often provides confirmation for the same or a similar reading), it is virtually certain that their shared readings represent those of the common B archetype. Having collected all the evidence from our own editions in progress as well as the Kane-Donaldson lemmata, I can see no instance where a convincing case can be made against the viability of such a shared LMR reading (as authentic Bx text) and rarely have found an instance where it seemed even problematic, regardless of the uniformity of attestation for a competing reading among other copies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The effect of this reassessment is not merely limited to perhaps two hundred textual situations where these manuscripts are arrayed against all the others. It also has profound implications for hundreds of other cases where the entire body of surviving copies is divided into two large camps, but with LR, LMR or LMRF all agreeing on one side. Of course it will never be possible to edit Piers Plowman B from a purely stemmatic perspective anyway, because the common parent was already (as Kane and Donaldson show persuasively but overemphatically) a sporadically corrupt descendant of the same authorial copy used by Langland later to create the C-version. As the Athlone editors did, it will still be necessary for us at every point to evaluate all the surviving readings for authenticity. Nevertheless, though our editorial methodology in evaluating specific textual cruces has been heavily influenced by Kane's style of rigorous eclecticism, our attitude toward Bx is somewhat more like that taken by Schmidt: that this hypothetical archetype is generally easy to reconstruct from stemmatic evidence readily available and should be afforded a broad assumption of reliability. This assumption of reliability is, of course, rebuttable at any given point by evidence drawn from the text of the other versions as well as by inference from Langland's metrical, syntactic and lexical norms. Only when our final critical edition of B is available will scholars be in a position to measure fully for themselves the utility and accuracy of our assessment of this textual situation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The evidence for the L/M-R/F group's superiority to all other combinations of attestation among the extant B manuscripts follows in an appendix, in the form of two charts. Neither chart can claim to be without some inadvertent omissions or gaps, but both are practically comprehensive within their intended scope. The first chart tracks through the entirety of the B-version all shared readings among this small group wherein a minimal requirement of LR agreement against most other B copies is met. The second chart is more restricted in nature and purpose, tracking differences between L and M from the beginning of the Prologue through the end of Passus 4. Here the point being illustrated is that these two copies rarely ever disagree; when they do, the differences are almost always the result of M's contamination (by erasure and “correction”) from Cr's exemplar, or unique copying errors committed by the M scribe. Other than these two categories, most of the other variations between L and M fall into the category of meaningless lexical, morphological, or syntactic variations where one scribe or the other shows a distinct preference for translating the Bx form into his own usage habits (e.g., M's sauen versus L's saue at 1.84; M's kepen versus L's kepe at 1.94; M's to ben versus L's ben at 2.28).</field>

      <field name="heading_text">SAMUEL RICHARDSON'S “ELEGANT DISQUISITIONS”: ANONYMOUS WRITING IN THE TRUE BRITON AND OTHER JOURNALS? by John A. Dussinger *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In contrast to the unwieldy canon of Daniel Defoe that was begun by George Chalmers toward the end of the eighteenth century and greatly augmented by John Robert Moore in the 1960s, the historical record of Samuel Richardson's writings has been remarkably unproblematic. Except for the attribution in the early twentieth century of two pamphlets, the Richardson canon has been intact from the beginning. Even though he never signed his novels and pretended to be only the editor rather than the author, the wealth of Richardson's correspondence that has survived during the years after the publication of Pamela in 1740 and throughout the rest of his writing career alone makes his authorship a certainty. But what about those nearly twenty years before his first and extremely popular novel made him a celebrity, especially while he was printing as many as seven journals? Richardson's biographers have been strangely remiss about the importance of his early career in newspapers for his later development as novelist. I argue here for the probability that almost as soon as he began printing journals he was also contributing occasional, anonymous letters and articles to them. In particular, I focus on the authorship of the True Briton No. 6, since it is the only anonymous piece attributed to Richardson by a contemporary—John Nichols. Although I am aware of the caveat about author-attribution set forth by P. N. Furbank and W. R. Owens, namely the caveat against “forging chains” of attribution by basing my argument on other tentative attributions, some features of the essays under discussion here explicitly connect them with each other. 1 Moreover, even if basing attributions on other tentative attributions is risky, it does not necessarily follow that they are wrong. While wary of the permissive methods in John Robert Moore's attributions for Defoe, I wish nevertheless to point out some of the anonymous writings that are most likely the work of Richardson during his many years as one of the major London newspaper printers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During the 1720s and 1730s, at the beginning of his career, Samuel Rich- ardson was engaged in printing seven journals— The True Briton (1723-24), The Plain Dealer (1724-25), The Daily Journal (1721-37), The Prompter (1734- 36), The Daily Gazetteer (1735-46), The Weekly Miscellany (1733-36), and The Citizen (1739). Despite the uncertainty about his role in the lastmentioned periodical and the lack of identifiable ornaments linking the Gazetteer to his press, Richardson was definitely the printer of the other papers. 2 At this time, well before the appearance of his first novel, Richardson had a reputation among his fellow printers for being a writer. In the January 1736 number of the Gentleman's Magazine, Edward Cave, the editor, remarked that Richardson had “often agreeably entertain'd with Elegant Disquisitions in Prose.” Among these anonymous works were doubtless the pamphlets The Apprentice's Vade Mecum (1734) and the Seasonable Examination of the Pleas and Pretensions of the Proprietors of, and Subscribers to, Play-Houses, Erected in Defiance of the Royal License (1735), both of which concerned the well-being of the City working men and the evil influence from the theater and other cultural diversions enjoyed by the upper-classes in the West End. Originally written in the form of a personal letter to his nephew Thomas Verren Richardson ( Imperial Review, 2 [1804]: 609-616), who was to have begun as his apprentice in the printing trade before his untimely death in November 1732, the Vade Mecum, though only a modest success in the author's lifetime, eventually became a standard reprint by the Stationers' Company down to the twentieth century. 3 Worth emphasis, too, is that after praising Richardson's reputation among printers at least at this time as an author of “Elegant Disquisitions in Prose,” Cave makes a point of printing the only known poem by Richardson, written to decline the invitation to attend a festive gathering of printers. 4</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a letter to Aaron Hill (1 February 1741), Richardson recounts how he had long been urged by two business associates, John Osborne, Senior, and Charles Rivington, to “give them a little book (which, they said, they were often asked after) of familiar letters on the useful concerns in common life.” 5 Letters Written to and for Particular Friends, on the Most Important Occa- sions was published on 23 January 1741. In his most valuable autobiographical letter, to his Dutch translator Johannes Stinstra (2 June 1753), Richardson mentions the fact that “Two Booksellers, my particular Friends, entreated me to write for them a little Volume of Letters, in a common Style, on such Subjects as might be of Use to those Country Readers who were unable to indite for themselves.” 6 The obvious question that needs to be asked here is exactly why these two booksellers thought that Richardson was the person to do a manual of letters in the first place. Perhaps, like Cave, they had known perfectly well that he had been printing letters of his own for years before this time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How far back, one may ask, does his reputation among printers as a letter-writer probably originate? The only recorded effort by early commentators to identify Richardson's possibly anonymous contributions is found in John Nichols's Literary Anecdotes, where in a footnote he observes that “it seems highly probable that the sixth [ True Briton No. 6] (June 21, 1723) was written by himself as it is much in his manner.” 7 Modern scholars have tended to dismiss this attribution. Alan McKillop thought that the question “cannot be proved or disproved.” By contrast, William Sale asserted flatly that No. 6 “is clearly not in Richardson's style.” Following suit, Duncan Eaves and Ben Kimpel stated that No. 6 “does not resemble anything Richardson later wrote.” 8</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Apparently none of these scholars examined carefully the whole run of the True Briton, which was edited and published by the flamboyant Philip, Duke of Wharton, who initially represented himself as an “Old Whig” in opposition to the Court Whigs under Walpole's ministry but later went over to the Pretender. Sale remarked that the signature “A.B.” was “probably only one of the several pseudonyms used by Wharton himself” (Sale, p. 43). Similarly, Eaves and Kimpel observed: “It is a `letter' (such letters were often written by the editors) warning against party spirit when it is exercised for persons and not for principles” (Eaves and Kimpel, p. 26). Although they do not say so, Eaves and Kimpel seem to be basing their judgment on Johnson's observation to Richardson that most of the letters to the Spectator were written by the authors themselves and that he followed the same practice in the Rambler. 9 But, of course, there was also a considerable correspondence between editors and readers. Furthermore, not all of the letters sent to the editor were accepted for publication. In two numbers of the Prompter (27 January and 2 March 1736), for instance, the editors tersely acknowledge receipt of letters signed “A.B.” that would not be printed. As James Tierney remarked privately to me, newspapers were usually all too willing to include letters if only to fill up space when news was short. But, by contrast, literary periodicals like the Spectator and the Rambler were much more rigorously controlled by the particular thematic concerns of the editors. 10</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While introducing the letter for No. 6 of the True Briton, the editor might, indeed, be creating a little fiction about its origins: “The following Letter came to my Hand on Monday last, and seems to be wrote by a Well- wisher to his Country. It claims a Place in this Paper, where I hope to have Opportunities of communicating more of this Correspondent's Letters to the World.” Even the postscript may be part of the fiction: “If you don't approve of the publication of this Letter in your Briton, be pleased to advertise in your next. I Have some farther Thoughts to communicate, which, I promise my self, will be found agreeable to the Honest Intention of your Paper.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But when the editor next adds a paragraph disputing A.B.'s judgment of the Atterbury case, it seems unlikely that he could be the author of this letter: “My Worthy Friend seems unacquainted with the Methods that were used to pass the Bills against the Bishop of Rochester and Mr. Kelly ”; and he regrets that space did not permit a full explanation of these methods. At the end of this number is an acknowledgement of another anonymous correspondent: “The Letter from Lincolns-Inn, dated June the 17th, came safe to Hand; and the Author [Wharton] returns his Thanks for the kind Advice given him in it: But assures his Friend, That he don't fear the Power of the Persons he mentions, any more than he doubts their Malice. ” At this point, it seems likely that the editor is no more the author of the letter by “A.B.” printed here than he is of the one received from Lincoln's Inn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oddly enough, neither Nichols nor the modern scholars noticed that in No. 23 (19 August 1723) Wharton makes an explicit connection: “The following Letter, written by the Gentleman who subscribes himself A. B. in the TRUE BRITON N° VI. having been unhappily mislaid, came but now to my Hands. I hope the Ingenious Author will excuse this late inserting of it, and favour me with his farther Correspondence.” This letter is an ironic attack on the bills recently passed concerning places and pensions. It again invokes the South Sea Directors Act, the subject of No. 6, as a precedent to the new Roman Catholic bill in retribution for the Jacobite conspiracy. In the next two numbers, No. 24 (23 August 1723) and No. 25 (26 August 1723), the writer signing himself “A.B.” is evidently the same. In No. 24, the editor again refers to him as “my worthy Friend,” and the author closes his letter thus: “I HOPE, Sir, that you will think this as fit for your Paper as my former Letters.” Although No. 25 lacks the editor's head note and any deferential remark by the author about possible acceptance of the letter, there is evidence, nevertheless, for connecting this number with the previous three letters signed “A.B.” The only other letters with this signature in the entire run of the True Briton are found in No. 9 (1 July 1723) and No. 22 (16 August 1723). Although the editor in No. 23 does not mention the anonymous letter in No. 9 but rather the one in No. 6, I believe that this brief letter may also be included with the other four as having been written by the same author. Because the head note for No. 22 mentions the fact that the letter came from “the Mayor of a Corporation,” I have excluded it from our consideration. Even if countless other anonymous letters in periodicals of the day adopt “A.B.” as a signature, it may be significant that Richardson also used “A.B.” to indicate the hypothetical employer of an apprentice whose signature is “N.N.” in the sample of a legal contract in The Apprentice's Vade Mecum (1734), p. 2.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In sum, it is surely plausible that Richardson was the author of these five letters in the True Briton. Of course, there may be other instances where he contributed items to papers that were not from his press. But for the sake of focusing on what seemed to me to be the most likely instances of his anonymous writings, I confined this search to the journals that are known to be associated with his press. I also resisted the temptation to claim Richardson as the author of at least one or two of those deeply ironic letters to the True Briton signed by female pseudonyms. My main premise here was to assume for once that John Nichols may have been correct in attributing No. 6 to Richardson and then try to account for this and the four related letters signed by A.B. for this journal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The transcriptions of the True Briton produced here are based on Richardson's 1723 reprints of all the numbers of this paper in two volumes, with continuous pagination, which includes His Grace the Duke of Wharton's Speech in the House of Lords, on behalf of Bishop Atterbury. Since I have in my possession No. 25, in its original state, among other sheets from this semiweekly periodical, I have quietly corrected the error in the reprint signature to No. 25, which should be “A.B.” rather than “B.A.” I have also used the microfilm copies of the Burney papers available from Research Publications. In reproducing the texts of the relevant number of the True Briton, I have enumerated each paragraph in the quoted essay for ease of reference.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. The True Briton No. 6 (21 June 1723) Introduction</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William Sale's categorical rejection of Nichols's hunch about No. 6 of the True Briton is difficult to understand. Unlike the non-committal McKillop, who wrote his opinion in 1936, Sale had completed his pioneering work on Richardson's printing business and had identified more than five hundred books from his press. Perhaps it was because Nichols had erred so grossly in stating that Richardson had printed no more than the first six numbers of the True Briton that Sale distrusted his judgment altogether. Yet, the political views expressed in this number seem to echo those of Archibald Hutcheson, who was Richardson's first main employer. Sale himself discovered that at this time Richardson printed some thirteen pamphlets by Hutcheson about the South Sea crisis and concluded: “That the opinions expressed in Hutcheson's pamphlets represented Richardson's own political sentiments is amply corroborated by other evidence.” 1 Lest we suspect Hutcheson as the author of this letter, it helps to know that he openly declared that he either signed his tracts with his real name or used the pseudonym “Philo Britannicus.” 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The early paragraphs' condemnation of party politics is surely in agreement with the view of Richardson, who voted for both Tory and Independent Whig candidates, and emphasized the central importance of the constitutional issues at stake. 3 In the fourth paragraph, the contrast between the old mon- archical authority and the post-1688-89 parliamentary court power is also typically Hutchesonian.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the passing attack on the previous Tory administration's flawed monetary policies, coupled with ironic praise of the great wealth demonstrated by the present government's spending schemes, the writer compares the South Sea Directors' Bill, which deprived the former directors of their estates, to the bills against Francis Atterbury, the Bishop of Rochester, his secretary, George Kelly, and John Plunket during the Jacobite conspiracy of the spring of 1722.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The acerbic tone toward the South Sea Directors' Bill here seems to derive from Hutcheson's general opposition to Walpole's scheme of resolving the South Sea Company's financial difficulties. 4 During 1720-22, the newspapers were full of stories about the hardships the disgraced South Sea Directors endured. Petitions by individuals forced to surrender their estates appeared, and the Daily Journal (6 June 1722) reported “that two of the late South-Sea Directors since the disposing of their Effects for the Use of the Publick in this manner [auction], are gone distracted.” Besides expressing compassion for these bankrupt businessmen, the author of the True Briton No. 6 is outraged that they were arbitrarily condemned by the government without due legal process. Thus, the overall thematic content and stylistic idiosyncrasies of this essay seem to point to Richardson as the author.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE following Letter came to my Hand on Monday last, and seems to be wrote by a Well-wisher to his Country. It claims a Place in this Paper, where I hope to have Opportunities of communicating more of this Correspondent's Letters to the World.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SIR, [1] YOU have very justly made Impartiality the First Qualification of your TRUE BRITON; and I promise myself, you will secure your Title to that Part of your Character. [2] TO call that Liberty to Day, which we call'd Liberty some Time ago; to esteem that to be Persecution against one, which we should esteem to be Persecution against another; to impute the same Effects to the same Causes; to call the same Things the same Things; though this may seem but a Low and Ordinary Degree of Understanding and Honesty, is yet that Greatness of Mind, that Impartiality of Judgment which very few People arrive at. [3] NOTHING is more common, than for a Party of Men, in a small Course of Time, to forget themselves, and act contrary to those very Principles which made them a Party. Parties will generally have so much of Madness, Violence, and Contradiction in their Conduct, as happens to be in the Private Temper of their Leaders. And are seldom any longer true to the Principles and Reasons of their Party, than those at the Head of them, prove to be moderate, equitable and undesigning Men. [4] AS Absolute Monarchy, in the Hands of a Wise and Virtuous Prince, may make a Nation for his Time, more Happy than any Legal Government; so the Cause of Liberty, when committed to the Hands of Violence, Avarice and Revenge, may more inslave a People, and destroy a Nation, than the heaviest Strokes of Monarchical Power. 5 The True Briton is, therefore, to look to the Preservation of the Peinciples [sic] of his Party, and not to the Men who make a Bluster 6 in it; for it will often happen, that he must lose his Party, if he will follow those whom Fortune has placed at the Head of it. An Evil Minister may have so acted, that he can be no longer safe, than whilst he is in Power: He may have more to fear, than an Evil Monarch, and to be forced upon more desperate Methods to secure himself from an abused, injured People. [5] THE True Briton is therefore to stick to 7 the Reasons and Principles of his Party. He is to follow the Old Patrons of his Cause; to adhere to Equity, Liberty, and Moderation; and to reckon none to be of his Party, who, on any Pretence whatsoever, swerve from them. The Good of Party, is, In supporting Principles; The Evil of Party, In following Persons. [6] WHEN I give this Advice, I can only be supposed to speak to the Tories; for the Whigs have been so Happy in their Governors, that they cannot follow them too blindly. Their Conduct, at least since His Majesty's Accession to the Throne, has been but One continued Act of Uniformity; One perpetual Endeavour to strengthen and finish the Glorious Fabrick of Liberty. [7] IN a Late Reign, Power was some Time in Other Hands; Liberty, for a while, hung down its Head; Property grew precarious, and Magna Charta as little valued as the Original Contract; Corruption increased; Bribery was established; Religion declined; and the Church was ashamed to see herself committed to the Care of an Illiterate, Weak, Worldly, Prostitute Clergy. [8] THOSE Days brought forth the Occasional and Schism Bills; which are such violent Attempts upon the Liberty of the Subject, as at once made the Kingdom but a Den of Slaves. The Peace with France had proved Great-Britain 's Funeral, had not His Majesty's Accession to the Throne, committed the Administration to the True Patrons of Liberty. These little Intervals of Tory Persecution and Slavery, have always created more Work for the better Party. 8 [9] BUT their Happy Continuance in Power since the Late Reign, and Freedom from any Fear of ever losing it, has made them able to compleat every Part of the Scheme of Liberty, and carry some Blessings of the Revolution higher than even the most Sanguine amongst us could expect. [10] THE Tories, when in Power, shewed themselves mere Bunglers: They knew nothing of Money Matters; Their Exchequer was Low; They feared Expences; State Officers were in Arear of their Salaries; and the Lord Treasurer came out of his Office, as Poor as he entered upon it. But now! Money is so Plentiful; the Exchequer is so Rich; that the Government has lately remitted above Seven Millions of Money to a Single Company. It is Happy for the Gentlemen in the Administration, that such a Sum of Money, so generously given, has also so much Justice to support the Gift. Or otherwise, since the Breach of Trust 9 is now made liable to be punished by Forfeiture of Estate, as appears by the South-Sea Directors Bill; the Nation, to whom that Money was due, might, some time or other, inquire after it. But the great Justice, the Extraordinary Charity, and the Wise Ends of giving the Nation 's Money to the South-Sea Company, are so plain and obvious an Instance of National Care, that those who are chiefly intitled to the Merit of it, may safely repose themselves upon the Nation's Favour. [11] WHEN Her Late Majesty was so Unhappy as to employ the Tories, the Church of England began to make broad her Philactery, and to talk of Independency 10 of the State; and Bishops were chosen to support such Claims. His Majesty's Happy Reign has filled that Reverend Bench with such Primitive, Learned and Apostolical Men, as even gain the Esteem and Favour of all the Sworn Enemies to Episcopacy. [12] THE Bishop of Rochester (as mere a Slave to Church Principles as Arch-Bishop Laud was) has had the Voices of Nineteen out of Twenty Bishops to Banish him the Kingdom. And to their Eternal Honour be it said, That neither the Sacredness of the Episcopal Character; nor the Extraordinariness of the Case; nor the Unusual Method of the Proceeding; nor their Concern for a Brother; nor their Affection for the Church; nor the Example of above Forty Temporal Lords, could abate their Christian Zeal for the Banishment of so Great and Eminent a Brother. The History of JOSEPH is a very entertaining Story. 11 [13] IT is endless to enumerate the various Circumstances of our present Happiness. The Number of Good Laws which have been lately made, as they must mightily Endear the Present Ministers to all Lovers of Liberty, so they reflect the highest Reproach upon those Days, when Power was in other Hands. [14] YOU have made Just Observations upon several Laws. I wonder how the South-Sea Directors Bill, by which they forfeit their Estates, escap'd your Observation. It is a Statute of as much Importance as that against Plunket, and as worthy the Thoughts of the True Briton. [15] THE several Bills against the Bishop of Rochester, Mr. Kelly, and Plunket, cannot be said to be form'd upon the Directors Bill, because the Bishop, Mr. Kelly, and Plunket, were allow'd to speak for Themselves, nor by their Council. These Gentlemen had also their Crimes specify'd; so that by Defences and Speeches, they have been able to let the World see the Nature of their Guilt, and the Strength of the Evidence against them. But the Directors had no Specification of their Crimes; nor was their Guilt fix'd to any Particulars; so that the World is left to judge of their Guilt only by the Nature of their Punishment. [16] NOW, altho' these Moderate, Gentle, Merciful Acts, cannot be said to be copy'd from the Directors Bill, because the Directors Bill has several severe Circumstances which these Bills have not; yet if, in any future Time, an Ill Ministry should procure a corrupt Parliament, to make People to forfeit their Estates for General Charges, without Trying them, without Hearing them; might not such Unmerciful Proceedings plead some Colour of Justice from the Bill against the late Directors? [17] GO on, SIR, to instruct and Reform a Corrupt Age; and teach Britons to be Good Men and True. Your Sincere Admirer, and Unworthy Correspondent, A. B. P. S. IF you don't approve of the Publication of this Letter in your Briton, be pleased to advertise in your next.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5 This contrast between absolute monarchy and an unlimited parliament appears in Archibald Hutcheson's speech in the House of Commons against repealing the Triennial Parliamentary system: A Speech Made in the House of Commons, April the 24th 1716 (London, 1722), p. 4. 6 The word “bluster” occurs repeatedly in Richardson's last two novels. In the Chadwyck-Healey database, out of a total of forty-three matches, we find one occurrence in Pamela, eighteen in the third edition of Clarissa and thirteen in Sir Charles Grandison. Out of the more than seventy novels covered in this database, Richardson's works have thirty-two of the total forty-three matches in the database. See the web version of Eighteenth-Century Fiction (Cambridge, England: Chadwyck-Healey Ltd., 1996). The original CD version issued by this publisher has a different interface engine and thus produces sometimes fewer occurrences than actually exist but on other occasions give slightly more matches than the on-line version. Unless otherwise noted, all further references, including quotations from the novels, are to this on-line database identified as “C-H.” While using this electronic resource, I should acknowledge the fact that since Richardson's three novels are considerably longer than those of any other author included, the chances are much greater that peculiar word usage will be found in his works rather than, say, in the one and only novel by Goldsmith. I am also aware that until we have Richardson's voluminous correspondence on-line, any generalization about word frequency in his writings remains tentative. I take into account, furthermore, that a writer's vocabulary will depend on his subject matter. For instance, the phrase “working class” never appears in Richardson's novels or in any of the other novels included in C-H. Yet, it does occur in a pamphlet attributed to Richardson written against erecting playhouses in the City. See my “`The Working Class of People': An Early Eighteenth-Century Source,” Notes and Queries, n.s. 43.3 (September 1996), 299-302. That said, if only to obviate commonplace usage in our word analysis the C-H database is invaluable for comparing Richardson's diction vis-à-vis that of other writers of fiction in the period. Since C-H includes both the first and sixth editions of Pamela and the first and third editions of Clarissa, I have used only one of each novel when counting the instances in Richardson to avoid inflating the number of occurrences. When citing the total of matches, furthermore, I have deducted the duplicates recorded in the two editions of Richardson's Pamela and Clarissa included in the database, the only author with multiple editions here. While numbering the matches in each case, I do not usually include plurals, conjugations, or other forms of the root word, and the tally may combine parts of speech. (The number of occurrences of bribe, for instance, does not include appearances of bribes or bribed, nor does it distinguish uses as nouns and verbs.) In a few cases, however, I do examine the different forms of the keywords and their specific contexts within the particular narrative in question. 7 The phrase “stick to” in the context of abiding by a maxim or rule appears twice in Pamela and only three other times out of the twenty matches in the other novels in C-H. 8 The basic assault on the Treaty of Utrecht that “had proved Great-Britain's Funeral” is similar to Richardson's view in his letter to Thomas Edwards, 27 January 1755: “We have had Rumors here of a French War, They have affected our Stocks. What a Nation of mischievous Monkeys is that of France. How I grudge them their Country, their Climate!—How often am I ready to execrate our Utrecht Negotiators.” (FM XII, 1, ff. 130-131; B, III, 112-115; Selected Letters of Samuel Richardson, ed. John Carroll [Oxford: Clarendon, 1964], pp. 307-308.) 9 Hutcheson uses this phrase repeatedly in his writings: My present Opinion, Sir, according to the best Judgment I am able to form, is, That if we should give our Consent to the passing of the Bill before us into a Law, we should be guilty of a most notorious Breach of the Trust reposed in us, by those who sent up hither, and shou'd make a very dangerous Step towards the Undermining of that Constitution, which our Ancestors have been so careful to preserve. ... These are my Reasons against the Bill, That our Consent to it wou'd be a Breach of Trust, and a dangerous Breach upon our Constitution.... (A Speech Made in the House of Commons, April the 24th 1716 [1722], pp. 1-2) Nor would I gain the Empire of the World, at the Price of so Infamous a Breach of Trust. ( A Collection of Advertisements, Letters and Papers, and Some Other Facts, Relating to the Last Elections at Westminster and Hasting [1722], pp. xiv-xv. Printed by R [Sale, p. 180]) 10 Even the term “Independency” may be significant: Of the six novelists in C-H to use this term, Richardson invoked it four times in Pamela, seven times in Clarissa (3rd edn.), and six times in Grandison. By contrast, the only other novelist to use it frequently was Smollett, with eight instances. Archibald Hutcheson favored this term in his political writings that Richardson was printing in the early 1720s. See, for instance, A Collection of Advertisements, p. 13: “to maintain and support the Dignity and Independency of the House of Commons. ” This essay is quoted at length below for TB No. 9. 11 The criticism of the bills against Atterbury, Kelly, and Plunket also probably reflects Richardson's early printing activities. As Sale has shown, Richardson printed Atterbury's Maxims just after the latter was forced into exile and also five editions during May and June 1723 of The Speech of George Kelly after Kelly appeared before the House of Lords to defend himself. Without being a Jacobite himself, Richardson was probably sympathetic with Atterbury and Kelly as victims of the hysteria promoted by the Walpole ministry (Sale, p. 39).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have some farther Thoughts to communicate, which, I promise my self, will be found agreeable to the Honest Intention of your Paper. MY Worthy Friend seems unacquainted with the Methods that were used to pass the Bills against the Bishop of Rochester and Mr. Kelly; The Zeal which appears in most Parts of his Letter, would make it necessary for me, in Gratitude, to lay the Whole of the Evidence for and against the Bishop of Rochester before him, were that at present Convenient, as well for his Satisfaction, as for the Justification of the Nineteen Bishops, who, I presume, would neither be afraid or ashamed to see that publish'd: Such an Opinion I entertain of their Steadiness and Firm Adherence to what they profess! THE Letter from Lincolns-Inn, dated June the 17th, came safe to Hand; and the Author returns his Thanks for the kind Advice given him in it: But assures his Friend, That he don't fear the Power of the Persons he mentions, any more than he doubts their Malice. 2. The True Briton No. 9 (1 July 1723) Introduction The True Briton No. 9 addresses the controversy surrounding the recent election for sheriffs in the City. As the Daily Journal (25 June 1723) announced: “Notwithstanding the great Appearance for Sir Richard Hopkins and Mr. Feast, the others were declared.... The D--- of W------ appear'd Yesterday at Guildhall, holding up his Hat with some Livery-Men for Sir John Williams and Richard Lockwood, Esq;.” Despite the efforts of the Walpole government on behalf of Hopkins and Feast, the Liverymen prevailed with their candidates; and the author of TB No. 9 defends the winners from the aspersions printed in various advertisements during the election campaign. Since the sheriffs have the responsibility for selecting jurymen, Wharton quotes the dire warning from the Daily Post (26 June 1723): “ you cannot but desire, that Juries, who have, in some Degree, the Disposal of your Lives, your Liberties, and your Properties, should be impanelled fairly and indifferently, and free from Byass and Prejudice. ” He points out that Williams and Lockwood, being “Eminent Turkey-Merchants, and great Proprietors in the Publick Funds,” are not likely to be enemies of constitutional government as their libellers had claimed. “But this Calumny proceeds from the Old Method, that has been the Constant Maxim of One Party, to brand every Subject with Jacobitism, who opposes their Measures in the least Instance.” Wharton ends by reminding his readers that the majority of the jury that found the Jacobite conspirator Christopher Layer guilty of treason were Tories. For his part, the author of the letter signed “A.B.” and appended to this article on the election stresses the illegal and violent methods used by the supporters of Hopkins and Feast. Basically, it protests against the barely disguised attempt by the Walpole government to curb the freedom of the City to elect its own representatives. Only a year later that attempt finally succeeded when Wharton over-reached himself politically after the death of Felix Feast and Walpole moved in for the kill. By December 1724 Walpole succeeded in persuading some prominent aldermen to cut back on their historically democratic election process; and a bill passed early the next year gave the aldermen veto power and stripped three thousand poorer liverymen of their right to vote (Plumb, 2:109). Other than generally attacking Walpole's infringement on the historical rights of the City, this letter may be connected to Richardson in more particular ways. The printer's first employer, the Tory Archibald Hutcheson, was the staunchest defender of free elections; and one item that issued from the Salisbury Court shop (Sale, p. 180) only two years before the appearance of this letter was even in the same rhetorical form of questions while attacking his opponent in the House of Commons: Some Queries proposed to Sir Thomas Crosse to be Answer'd, for the Satisfaction of the Electors of the City and Liberties of Westminster. 1 Just as Hutcheson was attacking the corruptions of a national election, so A.B. in TB No. 9 is protesting the government's interference with the City's election of its representatives. Wharton's vigorous defense of the City's ancient rights and privileges, to the extent of his becoming a member of the Wax Chandlers' Company, goes far in explaining Richardson's interest in this mercurial Tory aristocrat.

The True Briton No. 23 (19 August 1723) Introduction Since the editor's head note specifically mentions that No. 23 was written by the “Gentleman who subscribes himself A. B. in the TRUE BRITON N° VI,” then if Richardson wrote the earlier number, he also wrote the anonymous letter in this one. While trying to establish stylistic evidence for Richardson's anonymous publications, a major problem arises in cases that amount to mainly extracts from other writers. As in Nos. 6 and 9, this letter seems to be influenced by Hutcheson's anti-Walpolean stance on the economy. But instead of protracted argument, it comprises bits and pieces as if taken from a commonplace book. In the second paragraph, the mention of “the Mediterranean and Baltick Squadrons” refers to the article in the True Briton No. 4 (14 June 1723). Wharton's point there about the unnecessary debt caused by these fleets corresponds with Hutcheson's attack on the costs of maintaining “the Mediterranean and Baltick Squadrons” in a tract that Richardson had printed. 1 Another connection occurs in the use of the same English translation of Montaigne 2 in this letter that appears to be invoked in the third edition of Clarissa. Lovelace alludes to Montaigne: “Such a one as I, Jack, needed only, till now, to shake the stateliest tree, and the mellowed fruit dropt into my mouth: Always of Montaigne's taste, thou knowest: —Thought it a glory to subdue a girl of family.” 3 This specific reference to the great French essayist in the expanded edition of Clarissa makes it probable that Richardson would have known the anecdote about Dionysius derived from this same source. Some of the short paragraphs so curiously yoked together without clear transitions seem actually to be notes taken from newspaper items, as if gathered from a scrap book. In the eighth paragraph, the allusion to Neyno, for instance, parallels an item in the Daily Journal, which Richardson printed. 4 In the tenth paragraph, the reference to the “ Lady who was depriv'd of her Liberty on Suspicion of aiding and abetting a Nurse of the Pretender 's Child” refers to another story that appeared in the Daily Journal. 5 In paragraph twenty-one, “the Pretender 's late Secretary” refers ironically to Bolingbroke who had just returned from exile at the same time as Atterbury was banished. The Daily Journal (9 July 1723) announced: “Lodgings are hired near the Coca Tree in the Pall-Mall for the late Lord Viscount Bolingbroke.” In Clarissa, Richardson situates Lovelace and his rakes at this politically tainted coffee house. 6 In later life, Richardson never made a secret of his loathing for Bolingbroke. 7 Paragraph twenty-four repeats the complaint in TB No. 6 concerning the Roman Catholic Bill and resembles the announcements in the Daily Journal numbers for 26 November and 28 November 1722 about the raising of 100,000 l. from the estates of Roman Catholics. The arbitrary lumping together of innocent and guilty members of a class for collective punishment in this instance again parallels the summary injustice towards the South Sea Directors. It may well have been his memory of this persecution of the Roman Catholics after the Jacobite conspirace of 1722 that influenced his theme of religious toleration thirty years later in Sir Charles Grandison. Text THE following Letter, written by the Gentleman who subscribes himself A. B. in the TRUE BRITON No. VI. having been unhappily mislaid, came but now to my Hands. I hope the ingenious Author will excuse this late inserting of it, and favour me with his farther Correspondence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2 According to C-H, out of the eight uses of the term “intermeddling” in the novels included in this database, two instances are in Clarissa (3rd edn.) 3 Although the C-H registers twenty-three instances of “first quality,” with seven going to Richardson's novels, the only actual phrase “men of the first quality” appears in Grandison, 1:9. 4 Apparently the phrase “knock down” is very rare among the early novelists. Except for one instance in Thomas Amory's John Buncle, the only other reference is to Clarissa (3rd edn., but not the 1st), 7:396. 5 If the author of this letter is Richardson, he may have been recalling the language used by Hutcheson while urging Sunderland to get the King to limit the present parliament to one year and to promote a bill for either triennial or annual parliaments: “On this Foundation, the British Liberties would be firmly Established, and innumerable good Consequence would flow therefrom. An Assurance of this kind, must tend to the immediate Quieting the Minds of a disturbed People,” Copies of Some Letters from Mr. Hutcheson, to the late Earl of Sunderland (1722), p. 22. 6 The Duke of Wharton openly patronized the City and participated in its political gatherings. 1 [Archibald Hutcheson], A Collection of Advertisements, p. 36. 2 Essays of Michael Seigneur de Montaigne. ...

'” 4 Cf. The Daily Journal, 3 January 1723/24: “It may not be improper to acquaint our Readers, that Phillip Neyno, so often mention'd in the Proceedings against Mr. Kelly and the late Bishop of Rochester, was on the 31st of July, 1720, ordained in the Cathedral Church of Chester, by the present Bishop of that See; and in the Instrumental or Testimonial of his Ordination under the Episcopal Seal, and sign'd by the Bishop, (after the usual Preamble) are the following Words: Dilectum nobis in Christo Phillippum Neyno &amp;c Moribus nobis commendatum, ac in Doctrina &amp;c Scientia per nos &amp;c examinatores Nostros, approbatum nec non sufficienter Intitulatum, &amp;c. He was drowned in making his Escape from the Custody of a Messenger, soon after the Discovery of the late Conspiracy.” 5 (18 March 1722/23): “Mrs. Spinkes, Wife to a Nonjuring Clergyman, being traced out, and found to be capable of giving some Light into the Conspiracy, is put under Restraint, in order to her Examination. She is Aunt to Mrs. Hughes in the Hands of the Government, lately Nurse to the young Pretender.” 6 Cf. Clarissa, 3rd edn., 2:17; 4:274; and 5:20. 7 “St. John, as you most properly call him, has raised against his Works many Writers. I almost wish, that they had been left to the noble Discourses of Sherlock, so seasonably publish'd... and to Leland; for the Sale is far from answering the sanguine Expectations of Boutefeu Editor [David Mallett]; and I am afraid that so many Tracts on them will add to his Profits, by carrying into Notice Works that would have `probably' otherwise sink under the Weight of their dogmatical Abuse &amp; Virulence. I imagine, that these Works of the quondam Peer, so far as they favour the Cause of Infidelity, rather abound with Objections against the Christian System, that he thought New, than were really so.

      <field name="fulltext">To the TRUE BRITON. SIR, [1] THE obliging Manner in which you received my former Letter, has encouraged me to trouble you again. A Correspondence with a Gentleman so heartily engag'd in his Country's Interest, is highly agreeable to me. [2] YOU have touch'd upon the great Increase of our National Debts, and have observ'd, that Two visible Causes of it, have been the Mediterranean and Baltick Squadrons. [3] BUT after all, Sir, what a glorious and happy Way of spending our Money is this, if compar'd with what I have just read in an admir'd Author? [4] “A STRANGER having publickly said, that he could teach Dionysius the Tyrant of Syracuse, an infallible Way to find out and discover all the Conspiracies which his Subjects should contrive against him; Dionysius hearing of it, caus'd the Man to be brought to him, that he might learn an Art so necessary to his Preservation; and having ask'd him, By what Art he might make such Discoveries? the Fellow made Answer, That he should give him a Talent, and afterwards boast that he had obtain'd some mighty Secret from him.” 8 [5] TO what a miserable Condition were the Syracusian Subjects reduc'd, to have their Treasure lavish'd out in Sham-Contrivances against themselves? [6] BUT this generally used to be the last Contrivance of such Powers, as were too tyrannical and hated to support themselves by any other means. [7] NO one can be so Malicious or Weak as to imagine, here is any Reflection intended upon any Gentleman who has the Honour to be intrusted with the Care of the National Revenue. It would be injurious to suppose, that a Censure upon Astrologers, would reflect upon Sir Isaac Newton; or a Jest upon Quacks, affront a Mead or a Friend. [8] AS to the 300 l. indeed, which is said to have been given to Neyno, with a Promise of 2000 more, if it was true, that may serve for a Warning to all others, How they receive any Money of that Kind, since Neyno lost his Life so soon after it. [9] AS to the Proposal which Mr. Kelly declared to the Lords, was made to him by an Under-Secretary, by Order of his Superior, that casts no Reflection upon the Exchequer, it not appearing that he was to have any Present of the Nation's Money; for the Proposal being general, no one can say, but that it might be some Place, and not any Money, that was intended to be the Reward of his telling Truth. [10] THE Lady who was depriv'd of her Liberty on Suspicion of aiding and abetting a Nurse of the Pretender 's Child, was not loaded with Irons, nor committed to Newgate: She was only deliver'd over to Buggs in a Messenger's House, and was allow'd to speak to her Children thro' a Window, for some Months together. She has since been admitted to Bail, and her Friends hope she will not be try'd for Milk-Treason. [11] IF any one should be so Fantastical 9 as to suspect that the 200,000 l. which the Bishop of Rochester is said to have receiv'd, and the 50,000 l. which an Alderman is reported to have carry'd Abroad, must, by the Greatness of the Sums, have had Assistance from the Exchequer, I shall only reply to such imaginary Heads, That such conjectural Circumstances cannot be allow'd as any Evidence of the Thing, unless they had been declared so, by a Vote of Parliament. [12] EVERY one's General Character is his best Defence. 10 A Gentleman who has been known to be too honourable to take a Bribe, 11 at a Time when it was very convenient, may very well be suppos'd to be neither subject to the Power of Money himself, nor inclin'd to corrupt other People with it. [13] BUT after all, the highest and even undeniable Evidence of the Integrity of all our Ministers, is, The Exemplary Punishments they have lately set on foot.—Every Bill of Pains and Penalties is to me a plain Proof, that there is neither Bribery, nor Corruption, nor Abuse of Power, nor Breach of Trust, 12 nor any Ill-Conduct, that can ever be charg'd upon any of our Ministers. These are a Sort of Death's Head, that must appear at all their Entertainments, and be a constant Memento Mori 13 to them in every Step they take. [14] NAY, by the Bills that have lately passed, it seems not sufficient for any Minister to be innocent himself, unless all those who are employed with him be so likewise.—For if the Corruption and Villainy of any Minister, should raise an Odium 14 against them all, and put them all in one Bill, without suffering any one to excuse or defend himself, such a Bill need go no farther back for an exact Precedent for such Justice in the Lump, than to the South-Sea Directors Act. [15] EVERY Vote in either House of Parliament to make any Hear- say 15 Accusation, or other Circumstance, be received as Evidence, is a sufficient Declaration to the Kingdom, that those at the Helm, never intend to be subject to any Hear-say Crime, or to come near the smallest Circumstances of Guilt. [16] THESE Bills, as they declare the Innocency of the Ministry, so do they give a convincing Proof of the happy Union between the Court and Parliament, there having never been seen a more general Concurrence in full Parliament, than on that Occasion. [17] THE Persons that opposed these Bills, being only such as have neither Places nor Pensions, may be easily supposed to be out of Temper, and through such Resentment not be able to see so clearly as those who, by their favourable Situation, have their Minds more at Ease. [18] IT is a ridiculous Thing, to suppose, that Justice and Honour are less regarded by those who have Places or Pensions, than those that have them not. On the contrary, we ought to believe those most Just and Honourable, who have receiv'd such Marks of Royal Favour; and that it is their Justice and Integrity that have intitled them to such Rewards. As Gentlemen in the Army, have Commissions given, and are made Generals, not to teach them Courage and Bravery, but because they are known to be Brave and Courageous; so Pensions are conferr'd, not to Bribe Men to be Just and Honourable, but because they are so of themselves. [19] THAT this is true, not only appears from the Persons who have Pensions, but also from this, That as soon as they seem but to swerve from the smallest Instances of Truth and Integrity, their Pensions are withdrawn. [20] SO that though it may have some Appearance of Hardship for a Nation very much in Debt, to tax their Victuals to support Pensions, yet it has this Satisfaction attends it, that we may reckon a Number of Pensioners only another Name for a Number of fast Friends to Truth and Honour. [21] THE Pretender's late Secretary is just arrived in England, where he has both his Estate and Honour to seek; and if, in such a Case, He should be allowed a small Pension for the Encouragement of Integrity, what True Briton would think much of the Expence? Or, suppose his Falseness should intitle him to a Reward, we may be sure, it is such a Falseness, as is as useful as Truth, or else it will not be rewarded. [22] THAT Gentleman has nothing but an Attainder by Parliament to get off, in Order to be in Statu Quo; 16 and I suppose there is one who can prove it to be the Blackest 17 of Crimes, for any Gentleman to vote against it. —I long to hear some Court-Orators set forth this Gentleman's Merit! [23] I HAVE but one Argument against the Necessity of Pensions even for the Reward of Virtue, and that is taken from the Behaviour of the Scotch M—bers, and the English B—ps: The Unanimity of these Gentlemen in all the late Bills, is to me a convincing Argument, That Truth is the same in all Nations, and that People of different Northern Latitude may be equally Lovers of it. [24] THE Roman Catholick Bill for raising 100,000 l. upon their Estates, is another Instance of the Equity and Moderation of some Gentlemen: That Bill put the Statesman upon all his Methods, and was carry'd with much Difficulty: If it was any way expensive; if any Part of our National Trade was barter'd away for it; the Money which is to be raised by it, will be some Recompence. [25] THE Gentleman to whose Care the Passing of that Bill is owing, being too modest to receive Honour himself at present, the Thanks will not be returned for it, 'till it can be done without any Appearance of Flattery. Your most Obedient Servant, A. B.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">8 Although the anecdote about Dionysius the Elder resembles the one derived from Roger L'Estrange's Fables, used in TB No. 25, discussed below, it is, in fact, taken from the Cotton translation of Montaigne's Essays. Vol. 1, No. 8, “Sayings of Kings,” p. 168: “A Stranger having publickly said, that he could teach Dionysus the Tyrant of Syracusa an infallible way to find out [p. 169] and discover all the Conspiracies his Subjects should contrive against him, if he would give him a good Sum of Money for his Pains: Dionysus, hearing of it, caus'd the Man to be brought to him, that he might learn an Art so necessary to his Preservation; and having ask'd him by what Art he might make such Discoveries, the Fellow made Answer, That all the Art he knew, was That he should give him a Talent, and afterwards boast that he had obtained a singular Secret from him.” It is worth noting that besides omitting some phrases for greater concision, the writer of the True Briton substitutes “mighty” for “singular.” In C-H, of the 594 instances of “mighty,” 110 are in Richardson's novels. I am grateful to Bruce Swann, of the Classics Library at the University of Illinois Library, for pointing out to me the source of this anecdote from Plutarch's Moralia, 175f-176a, Loeb, trans. Frank Cole Babbitt (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1968; first printed 1931), 3:33. 9 This term may point to Richardson. Of the thirty matches altogether in C-H, three are in Pamela and two are in Clarissa (1st edn.). 10 Of the twenty-five occurrences of “general character” found in C-H, eighteen are in Richardson's novels, with thirteen in the third edition of Clarissa. Early in Clarissa, for example, Mr. Harlowe sides with his son, James, against Lovelace: “he was the more inclined to make his Son this compliment, as Mr. Lovelace's general character gave but too much ground for his Son's dislike of him” ( Clarissa, 3rd edn., 1:14). Towards the end of the story, Clarissa depends on a good report to trust Belford: “Mrs. Lovick has taken pains to enquire after his general character; and hears a very good one of him, for justice and generosity in all his concerns of Meum and Tuum, as they are called” ( Clarissa, 3rd edn., 7:48). 11 Although the word “bribe” in this same paragraph is much more commonplace, with 234 matches altogether in C-H, it is perhaps significant that Richardson's novels have a much higher concentration of uses, with fifty instances. 12 See note 9 to TB No. 6. 13 The terms “Death's Head” and “ Memento Mori ” at first glance may seem too commonplace to need investigation. But in C-H, whether spelled as “death's head” with five instances or as “death's-head” with only two matches, at least one of the former spelling appears in the third edition of Clarissa. Surprisingly enough, only five uses of Memento Mori occur in C-H, one of these in Richardson's Familiar Letters warning against the dangers to one's health from the abuse of alcohol among men. 14 Even this word may be indicative: of the only thirty instances in C-H, four are in Richardson. 15 “Hear-say” turns out to be relatively less frequent in C-H than one might expect, even taking into account the three basic forms of orthography. As “hear say,” we find only twelve instances altogether, with one instance in Pamela. As “hear-say,” we find ten altogether, with one in the first edition of Pamela. As “hearsay,” we find fourteen matches altogether, with four in the third edition of Clarissa and three in Grandison. 16 Again a term like “ Statu Quo ” may seem too commonplace to be useful. Yet, in C-H we find only eight occurrences altogether, with one in Clarissa. 17 Probably the least suspect term in this same paragraph, “Blackest,” turns out to be problematical. With only fifty-one instances altogether, eleven are in Richardson's novels.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4. The True Briton No. 24 (23 August 1723) Introduction The editor's head note implies at least some prior familiarity with the writer, and the closing remark by “A.B.” makes clear that he has had letters previously accepted for publication; it seems probable that this person was the same as the one who wrote Nos. 6, 9, and 23. Like Nos. 6 and 23, this letter once again addresses the oppression of the Roman Catholics under the recent governmental decrees in revenge for the Jacobite conspiracy. But the special emphasis on the plight of women who have to take oaths of allegiance to avoid the penalties imposed on their religious beliefs may bring us closer to Richardson's life-long interest in ameliorating the woman's situation in general. The topic concerning the solemn taking of oaths is a frequent occurrence in his novels, especially by way of discrediting the libertines whose word is worthless to women. But in contrast to the previous two letters by “A.B.,” this one is mainly an extracting of a long debate that “Dr. Wake (now Archbishop of Canterbury) published” as a “Practical Discourse concerning Swearing, in the Year 1696.” Although Sale does not provide evidence that Richardson printed anything by Wake, nevertheless the extensive extracting of this churchman's pronouncements on the issue of swearing has at least the format of what Richardson performed, say, in his culling of authorities in the third part of the Vade Mecum. In any case, this is more obviously the “cut-and-paste” technique of sifting other texts for one's own essay that Richardson is known to have used repeatedly and that is also very difficult to identify with any particular writer/editor in the process. It may be more than a coincidence that the Daily Journal (13 May 1723) ran The conduct of Dr. Wake, relating to the Controversy between him and Dr. Atterbury. This letter by “A.B.” appears after the editor's essay on the problem of the goverment's demanding oaths denying any allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church and thus supplements the previous number on religious persecution. A telltale sign of Richardson's hand in this number is difficult to prove because of its method of borrowing words at length from another author—Dr. William Wake, the Archbishop of Canterbury (1657-1737), on the matter of swearing. When McKillop noted Richardson's “rather perfunctory compilation of extracts from contemporary authors against `skepticism and infidelity,'” for the third part of the Vade Mecum, he need not have stopped there (Introduction to Vade Mecum, p. i). Much of the anonymous material in the newspapers printed and perhaps composed by Richardson is also in the form of perfunctory compilations. Richardson was an expert at the “cut-and-paste” technique in the printerly world of his time, and it is this very technique that lends him the aura of a man of learning. It may be the same writer, for instance, who, in the Daily Journal (13 May 1723), also extracted extensively Dr. Wake's opinions “relating to the controversy between him and Dr. Atterbury,” which according to the DNB is one of the most important among his voluminous writings. As a printer with more than a casual interest in the Atterbury case during the Jacobite scare of 1723, Richardson could well have had on hand Wake's tract in their controversy. Furthermore, in the True Briton No. 47 (11 November 1723), an advertisement for A Compleat History of Public and Solemn State Oaths, Containing, The Forms of all such as have been taken, either by the Kings of England at their Coronation, or administered to the Subjects upon every Occasion may indicate a source of this letter-writer's authority on the matter of oaths. In the domestic conflicts of his novels, Richardson continually emphasizes the need to distrust the libertine's word and his whole untrustworthiness while making promises. In the moral extracts from Clarissa, included in an appendix at the end of the third edition, Richardson observes: “The man who binds his Promises by Oaths, indirectly confesses that his word is not to be taken” ( Clarissa, 3rd edn., 8:393). Text THE following Letter is just come to my Hands from my worthy Friend, whose Honesty, I hope, every TRUE BRITON, who reads this Paper, will acknowledge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the TRUE BRITON. SIR, [1] THE Roman Catholick Bill, having some small Appearance of Severity, has made many Old Whigs to wish, That it had rather pass'd under some Tory Administration, than at a Time, when we see no Men in Power, but the undoubted Friends of Liberty and Moderation. But these are whimsical People, who don't think it sufficient to have their Friends in Power. [2] THESE Gentlemen don't consider, that Things take their Qualities from those that do them. If an Enemy strikes, we know he intended Mischief; but if a Parent makes us feel his Blows, and breaks a Limb or two with the Weight of 'em, we know that he designed our Good, and so should rejoice under his Paternal Care and Tenderness. 1 [3] THIS is the Light in which Dutiful Subjects, and True Members of a Party, should behold their Friends in Power. [4] THE Roman Catholick Non-conformity may be justly said to be purely Religious, there being not an Instance, that I remember, since the Revolution, of any one who has changed his Religion, who has not immediately conformed to the Government. Nay, most of the late Converts have happened to give such Proof of their Affection to our Constitution, as to receive very distinguishing Marks of Royal Favour. [5] NOW weak Minds may imagine, that therefore there is some Degree of Religious Persecution in this Bill; but with me it is sufficient to consider, that there are no Gentlemen in Power, but what are Friends to Religion, and Enemies to Persecution. [6] HAD this Bill pass'd at any Time, when the chief Power was in one Head strong, Lawless 2 Minister, who thought himself superiour to all Rules; who had no Regard either how he divided his Friends, or increased his Enemies; that hated every thing that was Legal and Regular, and scarce delighted in Gain, except it was Plunder; had this Bill passed in such Times, there would have been some Reason to have disliked it: But as we know the Reverse of all this to be true at present, there is as much Reason for all good Subjects to be free from all Uneasiness under it. [7] THE more obvious Reasons for this Bill seem to me to be as follow: I. TO curb and restrain the restless Endeavours of the Papists, to disturb the Peace of the Kingdom. FOR John Plunket, whose whole Estate is taken from him, and who was a principal Agent in the late most horrid and dreadful Plot, appears, upon the strictest Examination, to be a Papist. II. THE Papists being charged as Idolaters, such a Mark as this set upon them, must satisfy all good People, that the Ministry are no way inclined to Idolatry, which must be a great Benefit to the Kingdom. 3 III. THAT the Papists may not lie under any worldly Temptation to continue in a Religion so destructive of their Souls. THIS Reason, indeed, seems a little to contradict a late Favour granted to the Quakers, which is such an Encouragement to continue in their Delusion, that if they were to turn Christians, they would forfeit their Title to it. IV. TO enable us to procure better Terms for the Foreign Protestants in Popish Dominions. V. TO induce all Roman Catholick Princes to be steady and sincere in their Alliances to support the Protestant Succession in England. VI. TO prevent any more Religious Wars; for the Papists being stript of their Money, will not be able to contribute any Thing towards them. VII. THAT it may henceforward be a Rule, that all Plots be paid for by a Tax upon some Party, or Body of the People, that the Nation in general may be frighted at the Return of them. [8] IT is something particular, that our Protestant Women are to clear themselves from a Share in this Catholick Bill, by taking all the Oaths that relate to the Government. The Clemency and Wisdom of the Legislature has taken such Care of our Female Children, that they shall not have these Oaths forc'd upon them, 'till they are arrived at the Maturity of Eighteen. Whether they are to be Confirmed first by the Bishop, or to stay for Confirmation 'till they have seasoned their Minds with these Oaths, is not mentioned in the Bill. [9] I DON'T know of any Provision that is made for very Old or Infirm Women. It is a Convenience for such to live where the Parson is a Justice of the Peace, that when he brings the Sacrament to their Beds, he may tender the Oaths along with it. [10] I HAVE heard some People very large in their Exclamations against Creeds and Forms of Faith, as too great Restraints upon the Minds of Protestants. [11] BUT, perhaps, to be obliged to Swear, is not so great a Restraint, as to be obliged to Believe. [12] I SUPPOSE these Oaths must be something more than barely Law- ful , and that the taking of them must be something like keeping the Commandments, or else it would hardly suit with the Temper of our Religion to set whole Families a Swearing all over the Kingdom.—I have heard of General Fasts to implore the Blessings of God upon a Kingdom; Whether this general Swearing be intended to avert any Judgments of Heaven, I can't presume to say. [13] Dr. WAKE (now Archbishop of Canterbury ) published a Practical Discourse concerning Swearing, in the Year 1696. P. 141. This learned Divine says, It were much to be wished, that the Necessities of Government would permit, that an Oath should never be imposed upon, nor required of, any, but upon some greater Exigence, to be sure, more seldom than now it is. [14] THIS great Divine condemns the too much Swearing at that Time, though it is to be observed, that there was then no Oath of Abjuration, nor were any Persons oblig'd to take the others, except they were in some Post or Office. [15] WERE his Grace to write upon the same Subject in some future Time, when Oaths shall be multiplied, he must either alter his Divinity, or carry his Charge much higher, and affirm, as he does in another Place, that because of Swearing, not only Mens Souls suffer, but our very Land itself mourneth. THIS Learned Divine goes on thus: [16] AND when it is required, such Care should be taken in the administring of it, as to raise in Mens Minds a serious Consideration of what they are about, &amp;c. I don't know of any Provision of this kind in the Act, or that there is any Methods prescribed in it to raise Mens Minds to a Religious Reverence of an Oath: Nor have I heard that the Bishops, in their several Diocesses, are taking Pains to instruct their Young and Antient Females, in the Sacred Solemn Nature of an Oath, or to prevent their taking these in Rashness. [17] THE Penalty that attends Recusancy is no great Motive to Consideration and Seriousness; and if Dr. Hoadly, the late Bishop of Bangor, will shew, how People who Swear to save their Estates, can be said to swear in Sincerity, He will do an acceptable Piece of Service to the Female World. [18] HIS Grace of Canterbury tells us, p. 67. As for those Oaths which are impos'd by the Publick Authority, the Subject's Rule must be, to yield to them, in all Honest and Lawful Matters, and to take such as he can, with a good Conscience, take. [19] THIS shews us the Error of some People, who disregard what it is to which they Swear, and throw all upon the Legislature, and think that they may swear to any thing that is required by Authority; or, as a Lady said, in great Wrath, 4 and great Principle, That she would Swear any thing, rather than any Government should get Six pence by her.—But if Oaths, as this great Divine observes, tho' impos'd by Authority, are only to be taken, because they contain Lawful and Honest Matters, and such as are consistent with a good Conscience, as they are at present; How is it, that this Doctrine is not press'd and recomended at this Juncture? [20] THE Arch-Bishop, speaking of Assertory Oaths, saith, p. 15. He forswears himself, who swears to the Truth of any Fact, which he either certainly knows to be false, or does not know to be true.—It matters not whether a Man certainly knows what he swears to be false, it is enough that he does not know it to be true. Nay, should it happen to be true, yet if he thought otherwise, and yet swore to the Truth of it, he forswore himself. — [21] THIS Learned Arch-Bishop farther says, “ That he who would swear with a good Conscience, must duly consider what he is about to say, and proceed according to the strictest Measures of Truth and Fidelity; and that he forswears himself, if he swears to a Matter as certain, of which he has only a probable Assurance. ” Now, if some certain Oaths were to be try'd by this Standard, altho' they might be demonstrable Truths, yet this may not be so clear to all Old Women and Girls, as to need no Explication; and therefore whoever shall swear to those Truths, without as full Assurance of their being so, as I have, must, according to this Doctrine, forswear themselves. [22] HOW necessary is it therefore, that all who have any Land in the Kingdom, should now be inform'd of the Nature of Certainty and Probability; and the Degrees of Knowledge which every one must have of those Matters to which he Swears? [23] WERE the Laity, Male and Female, Young and Old, to swear, That Episcopacy is of Divine Right, and that the Presbyters have no Authority to Ordain in the Church, I question not but Nineteen in Twenty of a certain Order, would warn the People committed to their Care, of the Danger of such Oaths, and tell their tender Females Ten thousand Horrors of Perjury. [24] The little Ebony Doctor 5 would have his Conscience awaken'd upon such an Occasion, and exert his Casuistry 6 for the good of Souls. He would plainly prove, That such Oaths would curse the Island, and bring us into the Condition of Sodom and Gomorrha. [25] IT is not long since I saw the Hands of many of our Reverend Bishops subscrib'd to an Abhorrence of the late Unnatural Rebellion; and that Abhorrence was publish'd thro' the Kingdom. [26] COULD I see as many Reverend Hands to this Case of Conscience, to instruct the Young and Old that are to swear all over the Kingdom, demonstrating, that it is as safe to abjure the Pretender, as to trust in God, their very Enemies would be forced to own, That they fear'd God, as much as they honour'd the King. [27] BUT if all Orders of People are to be left to themselves, and neither inform'd how to swear with full Assurance of the Truth of what they are to affirm, nor exhorted to refuse, till they can swear with such Safety, I shall only recommend to that Reverend Bench these Words of Scripture:— Son of Man! I have made thee a Watchman unto the House of Israel; therefore hear the Word at my Mouth, and give them Warning from me; When I say unto the Wicked, Thou shalt surely die, and thou givest him not Warning, nor speakest to warn the Wicked from his wicked Way, to save his Life; the same wicked Man shall die in his Iniquity; but his Blood will I require at thy Hand! [28] I HOPE, Sir, that you will think this as fit your Paper as my former Letters, and believe me to be Your most Sincere Admirer, A. B.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1 The sarcastic comparison of these oppressive measures to “Paternal Care and Tenderness” invokes an apparently rare phrase for the time. Curiously, the on-line version of C-H does not register any matches from Richardson's novels but does cite eight instances from other novels. Yet, the CD-ROM version indicates the single occurrence of the phrase in Clarissa, where the heroine is thanking Dr. H. and Mr. Goddard for their “paternal care and concern” for her (3rd edn., 7:204). By contrast, the other eight examples cited in this version of the database lack the pairing of the phrase with either “care” or “tenderness.” Haywood is the only other author to connect the phrase with another term: “paternal care, and soft commiseration” in The Fatal Secret and “wisdom and paternal care” in Idalia. 2 The adjective “Lawless” at first may seem too commonplace to be noteworthy. Yet in C-H, of the thirty-two instances altogether eleven are to Richardson's novels; and only a few of the other works in this database use the term more than twice. By contrast, Pamela has four matches and Sir Charles Grandison, five. 3 This second reason given for the present Bill twists the term “Idolatry” to implicate the government in worshipping false gods. Of the seventy occurrences of this term in the database, only two are in Richardson. In Pamela (1st edn., Letter 32, 3:230), the term appears in a line quoted from Abraham Cowley. “Idolaters,” however, appears meaningfully in a letter by Clementina della Porretta to Sir Charles Grandison: “Perhaps, we Catholics are looked upon at Heretics here. Idolaters I know we are said to be—I grant that I had like to have been an idolater once—But let that pass. I believe we Catholics think worse of you Protestants, and you Protestants think worse of us Catholics, than either deserve: It may be so. But, to me, you seem to be a strange people, for all that” ( Sir Charles Grandison, 1st edn., Letter 20, p. 110). 4 Of the total sixteen instances for “great wrath” in C-H, eight are in Richardson's novels. 5 In TB No. 15, Wharton introduces a political allegory of the Atterbury affair by pretending to translate a manuscript found in the library of the Franciscans at Madrid. Don Ferdinando, “who was at this Time Comptroller of the Finances, and Prime Minister of Spain, ” is obviously Robert Walpole. The Bishop of Tortosa is Atterbury. In TB No. 22, Wharton mentions a mysterious clergyman: “The little EBONY DOCTOR is in Wrath at being sometimes nam'd by me; and therefore I must beg of him to be assur'd, I never should have thought of him, had he not appear'd pretty much in Publick of late, and frightned some few Ladies whose Families had a certain Prospect of being increas'd.” I venture to identify this person as White Kennett, D.D. (1660-1728), the partisan Whig Bishop of Peterborough, who together with William Wake, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London, entered into a well-known controversy with Atterbury over the rights of convocation. His being “pretty much in Publick of late” might refer to the new edition of his Compleat History of England (1719), which was vehemently against Jacobitism. Aside from the play on his unusual first name, White, “Ebony Doctor” may also be an allusion to the fact that Kennett “was obliged to wear a large patch of velvet on his forehead” after an accident that fractured his skull in 1689 (DNB). Presumably his grotesque appearance with this black patch was enough to frighten pregnant women to suffer miscarriage. As an opponent of the Walpolite persecution of Roman Catholics, A.B. understandably singles out White Kennett as the court favorite among Whig clergymen influencing this government policy. 6 Of the only four matches for “casuistry” in C-H, one is in Clarissa.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5. The True Briton No. 25 (26 August 1723) Introduction The fifth and final letter by “A.B.” in the True Briton that may be by Richardson, No. 25 (26 August 1723), lacks any head note by the editor or reference to the possible problem of acceptance for publication. Given his later edition of Roger L'Estrange's Aesop's Fables and his use of these fables in his novels, Richardson is likely to be the author of this letter, which quotes from L'Estrange's Fables and Stories Moralized a central lesson on worldly ambition, contrasting the “heroic” feats of Alexander the Great to the similar feats that are simply regarded as criminal by lowly individuals like pirates. 1 The basic parallel between the “hero” and the ordinary criminal here occurs in Richardson's fiction as well, notably in Clarissa. While justifying his role as libertine, for instance, Lovelace mitigates his violence toward women by contrasting it to the feats of the ancient heroes: “Are not you and I, Jack, innocent men, and babes in swadling-cloths, compared to Cæsar, and to his predecessor in heroism Alexander, dubbed for murders and depredation Magnus ?” ( Clarissa, 3rd edn., 4:260). Although it was a commonplace in this period to cite Alexander and Caesar as murderers, given Richardson's edition of Aesop, it seems reasonable to connect Lovelace's allusion to the anecdote here.

      <field name="fulltext">To the TRUE BRITON. SIR, [1] IT is generally agreed, that we ought to regulate our Opinions of Men by the Conformity of their Behaviour to the Rules of Moral Virtue; Rules sufficiently obvious to all Pers[o]ns, who will consider them with Attention; and especially in all those Cases which relate to the common Duties of Social Life. [2] THERE have been Persons in the World who have been highly caressed, and, to outward Appearance at least, esteemed, who yet, whether considered in their Private or their more Publick Capacity, have not acted conformably to the Moral Obligations they are under, on either Account; but, as it seems, in a direct and determined Opposition to them. 2 [3] OTHER Reasons may be assigned for the irregular and corrupt Judgment of the World in Favour of such Persons; but I shall specify one, which at present occurs to my Thoughts, and is, perhaps, among other causes of Popular Error, the most general and prevalent. I mean, The Influence of ill Example, when wicked Men have found means to establish themselves in Power, and to create numerous Dependencies. 3 [4] THE Pomp and Splendor of their Condition; the visible Homage that is every where paid to them, the Obsequiousness wherewith Persons both of Superior Understanding and Quality are often observed to approach them, do so dazle [sic] and confound People of weak Minds, that they can see nothing, during such Prepossessions, in a true Light. Even they who are more capable of distinguishing Real from Counterfeit Merit, yet, to favour their own Indolence, and to avoid the Pain and Trouble of Attention, chuse rather implicitely [sic] to follow the Multitude, and to take up with common Appearances of Things, than to examine them by the Test and Evidence of Reason. 4 [5] AND even where the Wickedness of Great Men is too notorious to be denied or dissembled, Reasons of Interest and Dependance, will, notwithstanding, so far blind the Eyes, and corrupt the Hearts of Men, as to furnish a thousand Pretences, such as they are, if not to justify their Misconduct, at least to palliate 5 and excuse it; by attributing their Measures to extraordinary Exigencies of State; sometimes to Causes which never subsisted; at other times, to remote Prospects of future Dangers. [6] UPON these Grounds we discover why it so frequently happens, that neither Persons nor Things are called by their right Names; why in High and Low Life, we appropriate very different Characters to Men, and treat them after a very different Manner who yet act upon the same vicious and dishonest Motives; why in some Parts of the World, one Man charged for a single Robbery on the Highway, committed, perhaps, for a Trifle, or the mere Relief of his Necessities, shall be executed; whilst another, who has inriched himself by continual Depredations, for a Course of some Years, at the Expence of his Country, shall not only escape with Impunity, but, by a servile Herd of Flatterers and Sycophants, have all his Actions crowned with Applause. 6 [7] THIS puts me in Mind of an Excellent Saying of a Pyrate to Alexander the Great, as mentioned by Sir Roger L'Estrange, in his Fables and Stories Moralized. [8] THAT great Prince `demanding of a Corsaire, that he had taken Prisoner (to use that celebrated Writer's own Words) How he durst presume to scour the Seas at that insolent Rate? Why, truly, says he, I scour the Seas for my Profit and my Pleasure, just as you scour the World: Only I am to be a Rogue for doing it with One Galley; and You must be a mighty Prince, forsooth, for doing the same Thing with an Army. Alexander was so pleas'd with the Bravery of the Man, that he immediately gave him his Liberty.' [9] THIS Story that excellent Mythologist Moralizes as follows. ` Power, says he, is no Privilege for Violence: It may create some Sort of Security in the Execution; but it gives no Manner of Right to the Committing of it: For Oppression and Injustice are the very same Thing in an Emperor, that they are in a Pirate. This, continues Sir Roger, was bravely said of the Corsaire, and it was as bravely done of Alexander; but whether it wrought upon his Conscience or his Honour, may be a Question; that is to say, Whether he was more moved with the Reason of the Thing, or with the Courage of the Man. But it looks well, however, either way; for Alexander not only forgave the Affront of being made the greater Thief of the Two, but gave the poor Fellow his Freedom over and above. And we have likewise this Document left us for our Instruction; That in all Fortunes and Extremes, a Great Soul will never want Matter to work upon.' I am, SIR, Your most Humble Servant, A.B.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2 The phrase “highly caressed” has only four matches in C- H, one of which is in Richardson. Again, the phrase “private capacity” has only three occurrences in C-H, with one instance in Pamela. The adverb “conformably” has only six instances in C-H, and two are in Clarissa. The phrase “moral obligations” occurs only six times in C-H, and all instances are in Richardson. 3 The phrase “Ill Example” is suspicious: of the only three instances in C-H, two are in Pamela and another in Grandison. Curiously, “wicked Men” is not a commonplace among the seventy-seven novels in C-H: of the sixteen matches altogether, nine are in Richardson. Similarly, of the sixty-three matches for “wicked man,” forty-seven are in Richardson. Even “Dependencies” is a significant term: out of the six total instances, three are in the first edition of Clarissa. 4 “Obsequiousness” finds twenty-one occurrences in C-H, with eleven instances in the third edition of Clarissa and two in Grandison. The image of how the splendor of those in power “do so dazle [sic] and confound People of weak Minds, that they can see nothing, during such Prepossessions, in a true Light” occurs in all three of Richardson's novels. But perhaps the closest parallel is found in the sequel to Pamela, where Mr. B. expresses his admiration of his wife's power: “No Wonder, when one looks back to thy first promising Dawn of Excellence, that thy fuller Day should thus irresistibly dazzle such weak Eyes as mine” ( Pamela, 1st edn., 4:213). The term “Prepossessions” is also a favorite with Richardson, with twelve instances out of a total of twenty-eight in C-H. The phrase “common appearances” occurs only once in C-H, that instance is in Pamela. 5 The verb “palliate” also seems to bear the Richardsonian stamp. Although there are as many as sixty-five occurrences in C-H, thirty are in Richardson's novels. 6 The phrase “a servile Herd” may have been more unusual than we think for the 1720s. The notion of the “herd” as mere cattle following a leader has fifty-four instances in the CD version C-H, of which twelve are in Richardson's novels. Although less unusual than “palliate,” still the proportion of occurrences in Richardson is significant. Even the term “Flatterers” is not all that commonplace for the novelists in C-H, where only thirty examples appear, of which eight are in Richardson's novels. The word “sycophant” has only nineteen instances in C-H, with five matches in Richardson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX Other Probable Attributions Signed “A.B.” To limit the scope of my investigations for this essay, I have deliberately focused on the five letters in the True Briton signed “A.B.” that seem to have been written by Richardson. Other letters whose authors are suspiciously identified as women with such names as “Athalia Dormant” in Nos. 28 and 34, “Conscientia” in No. 45, “Misericordia” in No. 47, and “Violette” in No. 71 could well be Richardsonian impersonations. When reading through all the available numbers of other journals known to have come from Richardson's press, I have also resisted speculating idly about a number of letters and articles that might conceivably have derived from his pen, whether signed “A.B.” or otherwise. After careful sifting through these journals, therefore, I submit the following six examples as very likely to have been written by Richardson. Four of the letters signed “A.B.” amount to advertisements for books that Richardson was printing at the time each extract appeared in the papers, and the other two are commentaries on subjects close to Richardson's life-long moral interest. I have used the Research Publications microfilm of the Burney papers for these journals. 1. The Plain Dealer No. 56 (2 October 1724). Letter from “ Your most Obedient Servant, A.B.,” expanding on an earlier article on “Detraction.” In the second paragraph of this letter, the writer seems to intend to substitute another term for “detraction” by offering “slander” or “calumny” as alternatives. Of the twenty-three instances in C-H for “detraction,” one occurs in the third edition of Clarissa. Of the ninety instances in C-H for “slander,” eight are in Richardson. Of the forty-two examples in C-H for “calumny,” five are in Richardson. The word “fools” is too commonplace to be significant, but “knaves” occurs only twenty-nine times in C-H, twice in Richardson. In the third paragraph, the verb “blacken” appears four times in Clarissa out of a total of twenty-two occurrences. The verb “eclipses” is quite rare among the novelists in C-H, with only five matches altogether, one is in Grandison. In the fifth paragraph, the adjective “musty” occurs only seventeen times in C-H, with four instances in Richardson. The reverence for Socrates in paragraph six is emphasized in Richardson's greatest novel: Belford declares: “O Lovelace! Lovelace! had I doubted it before, I should now be convinced, that there must be a World after this, to do justice to injured merit, and to punish such a barbarous perfidy! Could the divine Socrates, and the divine Clarissa, otherwise have suffered?” ( Clarissa, 1st edn., 5:224). In paragraph seven, the phrase “worthless fellow” is surprisingly rare among the novels included in C-H, with only eleven instances altogether, with one in the first edition of Clarissa and another in Sir Charles Grandison. Besides Aaron Hill's own interest in writing a life of the Duke of Marlborough, the high praise of this great general fits Richardson's attitude in his later years and his deploring the Tories who denigrated him in the reign of Queen Anne, as in his letter (4 June 1750) to Susannah Highmore. See Barbauld, 2:230. Of the twenty-eight instances for Marlborough in C-H, eight are in Richardson, all very positive on his behalf. Most surprisingly, the phrase “Country's Glory” is very rare: only two instances in C-H, with the one in Grandison, 2:284. 2. The Daily Journal No. 1047 (29 May 1724). Letter from “A.B.” with excerpt from Defoe's Tour. Advertisement for Defoe's Tour on second page. According to Sale, Richardson printed A Tour thro' the whole Island of Great-Britain, 3 vols. 1724-25-27. “Richardson printed the indexes for Vols. I and II, with his ornament No. 29 in Vol. I, and Nos. 35 and 57 in Vol. II. He also printed the first and second letters in Vol. II (pp. 1-192), with ornaments No. 27, 35, and 96. The third volume is the work of another press” (p. 163). The quotation above is taken from A Tour (1724), Letter One, 1:63-64. In this very short head note, the word “perusing” is surprisingly significant, with only thirty-six instances in C-H. Twelve are in Richardson, who used it far more frequently than any other novelist in the database. 3. The Daily Journal No. 3609 (28 July 1732). Letter signed A.B. on the engine at Venice used to dredge the channels and recommendation that same be used for the Thames. The long quotation and illustration are excerpted from Awnsham Churchill's A Collection of Voyages and Travels (London, 1732): Voyages and Travels lately publish'd in Folio, which was written by the celebrated Sir Philip Skippon, 6:504. Richardson had printed only the sixth volume of this travel book, in 1732 (Sale, p. 233). A machine collation with the Lindstrand Comparator indicates that the image in the Daily Journal is identical with the woodcut illustration in the Churchill Collection volume that Richardson printed. Since illustrations in early newspapers are rare and mostly found in advertisements for quack remedies, this drawing of the engine at Venice prominently displayed on the front page must have stood out for readers at the time. The expression “choaked up” is unusual among the early novelists, with only nine instances on C-H, five of which are in Richardson. None of the other four authors used it more than once in their respective works. Furthermore, there are no instances at all for the modern spelling “choked up.” 4. The Weekly Miscellany No. 56 (5 January 1734). Letter from “ Yours, &amp;c., A.B.,” advocating sumptuary laws against extravagant dress, followed by a long quotation from Vade Mecum, p. 33. In the first paragraph, the verb “bemoan'd” or “bemoaned” has only eight instances altogether in C-H, one in Grandison. In the second paragraph, the phrase “fatal Mischiefs” is very rare: only five instances altogether in C-H and all from Richardson. The verb “propagated” has only forty- eight instances in C-H, with thirteen in Richardson. In the fourth paragraph, the phrase “reasonable Hope” has only eight instances in C-H, with two in Clarissa. Even “peacocks” is quite rare in these novels, with only seven instances altogether, two appearing in Richardson, one in the Familiar Letters and another in the third edition of Clarissa. The phrase “ridiculous Light” in paragraph six is also a rarity, with only six instances altogether, one in Clarissa. 5. The Weekly Miscellany No. 245 (3 September 1737). Letter from “ Your constant Reader, A.B.” concerning a pamphlet. George Berkeley's The Querist on Ireland. Despite its being such a short note, the term “improvements” may be significant. Of the one hundred and fourteen instances in C-H, thirty-one are from Richardson's three novels and Familiar Letters. The rhetorical strategy of queries in Berkeley's piece is a reminder of A.B.'s letter in TB No. 9. 6. The Daily Gazetteer No. 1419 (9 January 1740). Letter from “Your's &amp;c. A. B.” concerning the multitude of prostitutes in the streets of London. From his earliest known writing, namely the Vade Mecum (1734), Richardson was concerned about the evils of prostitution. On religious and legal grounds, he warns against the evils of “the Company of lewd Women” (p. 4). One of his objections to apprentices' attending play-houses is “The great Resort of lewd Women to these Places where the Temptation is made the stronger, by the Impressions which the Musick and the Entertainment are liable to make on young and unguarded Minds” (p. 10). But Richardson does recommend Lillo's The London Merchant because it represents “the Artifices of a lewd Woman, and the seduction of an unwary young Man” (p. 16). Young women of upright citizens are also warned against attending the play- houses, where they would meet “an infamous Troop of wretched Strollers, who by our very Laws are deemed Vagabonds, and a collected String, of abandon'd Harlots” (p. 17). Towards the end of the final paragraph of this letter to the Daily Gazetteer, the writer mentions a recent charitable institution: “The Preserving the Lives of the Poor Infant Fruits of Shame, Sin, and Extreme Poverty, has lately taken up the Attention of many Noble and Honourable Personages.” This is an allusion to the Foundling Hospital, whose governors included friends William Hogarth, Francis Child, John Barnard, and Archibald Hutcheson. In 1739, Richardson printed the Foundling Hospital. A Copy of the Royal Charter, Establishing an Hospital for the Maintenance and Education of Exposed and Deserted Young Children (Sale, p. 171). When the Magdalen House, an institution for reformed prostitutes, was established in 1758, Richardson took an interest in it mmediately, having himself proposed the idea through his exemplary gentleman: I have another scheme, my Lord, proceeded Sir Charles—An Hospital for Female Penitents; for such unhappy women, as having been once drawn in, and betrayed by the perfidy of men, find themselves, by the cruelty of the world, and principally by that of their own Sex, unable to recover the path of virtue, when perhaps (convinced of the wickedness of the men in whose honour they confided) they would willingly make their first departure from it the last. These, continued he, are the poor creatures who are eminently intitled to our pity, tho' they seldom meet with it. ( Sir Charles Grandison, 4:142) Richardson donated to this institution, and in 1760, he was one of the annual governors (Eaves and Kimpel, p. 465). Although the letter-writer in the Daily Gazetteer may seem less charitable than Richardson, it needs to be emphasized that the Magdalen House was intended primarily to aid women who had been seduced by promises of marriage and that they could be discharged for poor behavior. Near the end of his life Richardson also assisted Lady Barbara Montagu in getting a novel by an unknown protégée published— The Histories of Some of the Penitents in the Magdalen House, which he himself printed in 1760. Besides Richardson's life-long interest in the problems of prostitution, the language of this letter to the Daily Gazetteer shows traces of his style. In the first paragraph, the phrase “generous Protection” is quite rare in C-H, with only three instances altogether, two in Grandison and one in Burney's Evelina. In the second paragraph the word “stripling” occurs only eighteen times in C-H, with one instance in Grandison. The word “Remissness” occurs only twenty times in the database, with twelve in Richardson, seven alone in the Familiar Letters. The phrase “little Restraint” is surprisingly rare among the early novelists; but of the five instances, two are in Richardson. Of the total of fifty-eight instances for “allowances,” thirty- three are in Richardson. In C-H the term “free-livers” or “free livers” appears only in Richardson's novels. In the singular form, the term “free-liver” or “free liver” is also exclusive to this author. In the third paragraph, of the twenty-seven matches for “Informations,” eleven are in Richardson. The phrase “Private Capacity” has only three instances in C-H, with one in Pamela. The phrase “Bad Women” is apparently unique in C-H: just one instance altogether—in Clarissa (1st edn., 6:150; 3rd edn., 6:265). Even the singular form is infrequent, and of the twenty-two instances in C-H for “bad woman,” ten are in Richardson. By contrast, “bad men” occurs nineteen times in C-H, with six instances in Richardson. Yet, “bad man” has thirty-seven matches in C-H, with twenty-five in Richardson.</field>

SIR, Jan. 17, 1735-36. You're desir'd on Monday next to meet At Salutation tavern, Newgate-Street. Supper will be on table just at eight. Stewards, One of St John 's, [William Bowyer, Junior] the other St John's-Gate [Edward Cave]....

To steward St John, steward St John's Gate, Who meet to sup on monday night at eight. Dear sons of Phœbus, darlings of the nine, Henceforth, thro' you, how will the printers shine, Who ne'er, without the muse, shall meet to sup or dine! Blessings, say I, attend your rhyming pen, No king John's, sure, e'er equal'd saint John's men! But, tell me, friends, nor blush, nor be afraid To own the truth—had you no third man's aid? Speak out, like men—to make the verse run sweeter, Did not some mild-beer Bellman tag the metre? If so, I pray, invite the honest fellow, Let him partake the praise, and make him mellow. Perpetual stewards, may you voted be; No less such verse deserves— perpetual poet he! For me, I'm much concern'd I cannot meet “At salutation-tavern, Newgate-street. ” Your notice, like your verse (so sweet and short!) If longer, I'd sincerely thank'd you for't. Howe'er, receive my wishes, sons of verse! May every man who meets, your praise rehearse! May mirth, as plenty, crown your chearful board, And ev'ry one part happy —as a lord! That when at home, (by such sweet verses fir'd) Your families may think you all inspir'd! So wishes he, who, pre-ingag'd, can't know The pleasures that wou'd from your meeting flow. S. R. Concerning this Gentleman, the Company observ'd, that tho' the Publick is often agreeably entertain'd with Elegant Disquisitions in Prose, not one imagin'd that his extensive Business would allow him the least Leisure to invoke the Muses.... It needs to be emphasized here, I believe, that Cave attests to the frequency of these “Elegant Disquisitions in Prose.” It is also worth noting that Richardson actually signed this poem for once with his proper initials, “S.R.” Obviously Richardson had written more than the two pamphlets first identified by McKillop concerning apprentices and the rise of illegal theaters in the City. As Peter Sabor observed to me privately, to judge by this instance, it may well be that Richardson wrote one or two of the poems included in his novels. 5 The Correspondence of Samuel Richardson, ed.

Press, 1950), p. 43; and T. C. Duncan Eaves and Ben D. Kimpel, Samuel Richardson, A Biography (Oxford: Clarendon, 1971), p. 26. What Richardson “later wrote,” of course, begs the question. We need to find what Richardson probably wrote before 1740 before making such a judgment. 9 Richardson's letters to Lady Bradshaigh of 5 October 1753, and of 8 December 1753, regarding Johnson's rejection of her letter for the Rambler. R agrees with Lady B that J should not advertise for letters to the editor if he as a rule writes his own for the journal. Cf. Richardson's unpublished correspondence in the Forster Collection, Victoria and Albert Museum, FM XI, (5 October 1753), ff. 29-32; FM XI, (8 December 1753), ff. 49-53. 10 Electronic mail, 2/1/00, University of Missouri-St. Louis. 1 Sale, p. 121. Sale also points out Richardson's tribute to Hutcheson in Clarissa, some twenty-six years later: Lovelace's uncle Lord M. offered him political counsel: I remember ( for I have it down ) why my old friend Archibald Hutcheson said; and it was a very good Saying—(to Mr. Secretary Craggs, I think, itwas [sic]—`I look upon an Administration, as entitled to every Vote I can with good conscience give it; for a [p. 242] House of Commons should not needlessly put Drags upon the Wheels of Government: And, when I have not given it my Vote, it was with regret: And, for my Country's sake, I wished with all my heart, the measure had been such as I could have approved.' And another Saying he had, which was this; `Neither can an Opposition, neither can a Ministry, be always wrong. To be a plumb man therefore with either, is an infallible mark, that that man must mean more and worse than he will own he does mean.' Are these Sayings bad, Sir? Are they to be despised?—Well then, why should I be despised for remembering them, and quoting them, as I love to do? ( Clarissa, 3rd edn. [1751], 4:241-242) It is worth pointing out that the non-partisan position adopted here from Hutcheson's sage advice is also evident in the symbolic game of whist in Pamela, where Mr. B sounds very much like this powerful critic of Walpole. See my article, “` Ciceronian Eloquence': The Politics of Virtue in Richardson's Pamela, ” Eighteenth-Century Fiction, 12 (October 1999), 39-60, esp. 58- 60. 2 “I have always freely own'd such Papers as come from my Pen, as I did that sign'd Philo-Britannicus, published in the Freeholder of Wednesday the 7th of March, 1721. the very Day it first appear'd,” A Collection of Advertisements, Letters and Papers, and Some Other Facts, Relating to the Last Elections at Westminster and Hastings (1722), p. vii. See also p. 36. Cf. letter from Philo-Britannicus in The Daily Journal (14 March 1721/22) reporting the meeting of London Citizens, when the Aldermen Hoysham, Brocas, Child, and Richard Lockwood were chosen. The speech by Mr. Deputy Robinson concerned issues above partisan interests and stressed the advantage of frequent parliaments for trade, and other Huchesonian principles. 3 For instance, during the scrutiny after the Oxfordshire election of 1754, Richardson wrote to Thomas Edwards, objecting to the partisan labels of “Old Interest” [Tory] vs. “New Interest” [Whig]: “This abominable Oxford election! What time does it take up! Have you heard of the applause Mr. Pratt has met with from both sides, for his speech for summing up the particulars of the objections to voters for the new interest as it is called, absurdly enough; since it is surely the interest of the country?” (FM XII, l. f. 130; also, Barbauld 3:113). 4 J. H. Plumb, Sir Robert Walpole (London: Allen Lane, The Penguin Press), 1956, 1:372-374.

      <field name="heading_text">FIELDING, RICHARDSON AND WILLIAM STRAHAN: A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PUZZLE by Keith Maslen</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The presence in the two 1755 editions of Henry Fielding's Journal of a voyage to Lisbon of distinctive printer's ornaments used elsewhere by Samuel Richardson raises interesting questions. Did Richardson, not known to have printed earlier works by the rival he disparaged as `low', magnanimously collaborate in the printing of Fielding's last written, first posthumously published work? 1 If so, what part could this be, for the printing of all but a sheet or two of both editions is entered in a customer ledger of William Strahan, who was then already matching Richardson as a great London printer? 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fielding's last act as an author had been to insist that he, like Richardson, aimed `to convey instruction in the vehicle of entertainment', and provocatively to define himself in opposition to those writers `who often fill a whole sheet with their own praises' (Preface to the Journal ). Thomas Edwards was sure that Richardson was being slighted. Writing to the latter on 28 May 1755, he protested at Fielding's `impudence in attributing that to your work which is the true character of his own'. 3 Edwards informed another correspondent that `Fielding's malevolence against our friend was the more unpardonable as the Good Man had once by his interposition saved his bones and at the very last by his correspondence at Lisbon had procured him accommodations which he could not otherwise have had'. 4 Richardson's own reaction is not on record, but it is hard to believe that his inclination to relieve human distress would knowingly extend to the printing of an unanswerable challenge from beyond the tomb.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nevertheless, those `Richardson' ornaments cannot be ignored. At first sight they seem to indicate that Richardson had collaborated with Strahan in the printing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bibliographical use of printer's ornaments in helping to identify the work of a particular printer is well understood. Investigations of Richardson's printing by William M. Sale, Jr., 5 and in my fuller newly published study rely on the assumption that Richardson, like other London printers of his time, built up and maintained a stock of ornamental headpieces, tailpieces, factotums and initials which, following the prevailing fashion, he used frequently throughout the majority of his productions. This assumption has been thoroughly tested and proved reliable. Precisely detailed confirmation of the value of printer's ornaments in identifying a printer's works has been supplied by the printing accounts of Richardson's London contemporaries, the Bowyers. 6 For Richardson too I have drawn on printing accounts unknown to or little used by Sale, which, in many hundreds of instances, confirm the physical evidence of ornaments.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The relatively few problems encountered mostly concern instances of shared printing. 7 This trade practice was succinctly explained by Richardson in a letter to Johannes Stinstra of 26 November 1755: `Every Printer here, being furnished with his [Caslon's] Types, the Booksellers, in a large Work, can for Dispatch-Sake, put it to several Printers, and print on the same Type'. 8 In such cases a publisher would assign the composition and presswork of one whole volume of a multi-volume work, or a sequence of signatures in a large folio, to one of two or more printers. The two usual motives for dividing copy among two or more printers were, as Richardson notes, the size of the work, and/or the need for haste. The practice was common long before Caslon types from the 1730s began to set the London standard, the consequent reduction in typographical diversity making the bibliographer's work more difficult. However, throughout Richardson's career as master, from 1720 to 1761, the presence of impressions made from printer's ornaments (in the form of relief `cuts', not cast fleurons) is usually the first warning of shared printing. Where ornaments are few or absent, as for instance in works of learning, shared printing may easily pass unsuspected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Richardson, like other printers of his time, often and unavoidably engaged in this practice. I have discovered fifty or so works the printing of which Richardson shared with other printers. Of these, ten were printed with Strahan between 1743 and 1754, but curiously not one thereafter—to set aside Fielding's Journal for the moment. The ten are listed in Appendix 2. By comparison, between 1730 and 1761 Richardson shared with Bowyer the printing of seventeen works, while Strahan and Bowyer shared nineteen between 1741 and 1761. 9</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the case of the 1755 editions of the Journal of a voyage to Lisbon, shared printing would at first sight seem to be the obvious explanation for the presence of ornaments apparently not all from the one printing house. Against this it must be admitted that no credible typographical division of work has been detected. Moreover, the incidence of `Richardson' ornaments in the same forme and even on the same page with others found nowhere else in his printing argues strongly that composition was performed in the one printing house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It will be helpful to review the known bibliographical facts. There were two textually variant editions of Fielding's Journal of a voyage to Lisbon published during 1755. 10 These are usually referred to as `Francis' and `Humphrys', after the different surnames assigned in the narrative to Fielding's hosts at Ryde. The Francis edition was first printed, but second published. Humphrys was printed immediately after Francis, and published without delay—reviews appeared in mid-February 1755. Andrew Millar, the book-seller responsible, seems to have quietly released copies of Francis when his stock of Humphrys was running low. Demand may have increased after the news of the Lisbon earthquake reached London in November 1755. Francis collates [A] 4 B-L 12 M 4 , or 10⅔ sheets; Humphrys [A] 4 B-M 12 N 6 , or 11⅚ sheets. The rare reissue of Francis has a recomposed and newly printed half-sheet collating a1, 2.3... M1, 2.3 which replaces [A] 4 and M 4 .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There can be no doubt that both editions were printed, in part if not wholly, by William Strahan, who began as a master printer in 1738, and within thirty or so years became the largest printer in London. Strahan's ledger A records his printing in January 1755 of 10 sheets of one edition (Francis), with extraordinary corrections costing 17 shillings, followed by 12 sheets of a `2d' (Humphrys), both editions in 2,500 copies. 11 Printing of Francis must have begun the previous December, for in an account of `the Estate of Wm Strahan' for 1 January 1755 under the heading `Work unfinished' Strahan listed 2500 copies of Voyage to Lisbon, 7 Sheets at £1 15 s. 12 These seven sheets were very probably B-H, the first seven sheets of the text. In July 1756 Strahan further records the printing of 500 copies of an extra half sheet, which neatly corresponds to the six leaves of the reset outside gatherings of the reissue. 13 All three items are charged to Millar, for whom Strahan printed much throughout his career, as did Richardson, if rather less often.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Unfortunately the collations and the ledger record for the two editions do not quite match. The January ledger record for Francis would exactly fit signatures B-L, and, as Amory suggests (p. 197), this may imply that printing was suspended after signatures B-L had been worked off. However, no separate charge for the outside part sheets has been found in Strahan's ledgers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Strahan's charge for printing 12 sheets of Humphrys is not in itself puzzling, for the work as it stands is just under 12 sheets. However, there is a complication. W. B. Todd established that signature [A] 4 of both Francis and Humphrys was printed by half-sheet imposition on paper with a star watermark identical to that used for the rest of Humphrys. It may be inferred that enough copies for both editions were printed at one time. The ledger account does not seem to cover the copies intended for Francis. Likewise not brought to account is M 4 of the Francis edition. This too, according to Todd, was printed by half-sheet imposition, but on the fleur-de-lys paper used for Francis. 14 These awkward procedures, presumably resulting in wastage of one-third of the sheet in each case, should have resulted in additional charges. It may be supposed that the printing of both [A] 4 and M 4 was carried out after Strahan had made up his account. But if so, why did Strahan, so careful and prompt a bookkeeper, fail to charge for them?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Such unresolved questions are compounded by the conjunction in Francis, Humphrys, and the reprinted half-sheet of five ornaments known to have been used elsewhere by Richardson and six others attributable to Strahan. The facts are tabulated below to show the distribution of ornaments. These are identified by kind and order of first occurrence, with Tailpieces denoted by T, Headpieces by H, Factotums by F, and the one Initial by I. The first references for Richardson ornaments are marked `(R)', and those for Strahan's are marked `(S)'. Further information about all ornaments, noting other works in which they have been found, is given in Appendix 1.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The puzzling association and location of `Richardson' and `Strahan' ornaments—to adopt a convenient short-hand—is also visible in the reprinted half-sheet. Given that the half- sheet corresponds with that entered in Strahan's ledger, the four ornaments T1, H1, F1, and T2 must in July 1756 have all been deployed by Strahan himself. Their presence in [A] of both editions speaks for their use by Strahan in January 1755.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Inquiry into the history of the ornaments in question offers a way of attacking this bibliographical puzzle. In the course of preparing a comprehensive study of Richardson's printing I have identified over five hundred ornaments he used between 1720 and his death in 1761. 15 By entering every use of every ornament into a relational database (using 4D First, the entry level version of Fourth Dimension) I can tell how often each ornament was used and over what period of years. Because I have included ornaments from works that Richardson might have printed only in part, I have included those from the two editions of the Journal. My findings on the five Richardson ornaments, showing the dates of their use by Richardson and by Strahan, are tabulated as follows:</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Ornament Richardson Strahan T1 1748 1752, 1755-56 ( Journal &amp; reprint) H1 1735-54 1755-56 ( Journal &amp; reprint), 1760 H2 1736-54 1755 ( Journal ) H4 1748-54 1755 ( Journal ) F3 1752 1755 ( Journal )</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A striking pattern can be seen. Notwithstanding their previous history of use by Richardson, all the ornaments in Francis and Humphrys were by January 1755, or even by December 1754, in Strahan's possession, where, as far as the evidence extends, they remained. Richardson's collaboration in the printing of the Journal must therefore be ruled out as very unlikely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The question remains: if Richardson and Strahan were not engaged in the fairly common practice of shared printing (in which each would have printed parts of given books), how did in fact the five `Richardson' ornaments come to appear in books apparently printed by Strahan? One possibility is through borrowing, a practice whose complications for bibliographical study have been acknowledged but seldom pursued. 16 Type itself, especially exotic founts, must often have been borrowed and returned; John Nichols, for instance, kept a list of `Sorts lent to different printers'. 17 Although, so far as I know, neither Nichols nor the Bowyers mention lending ornaments as well, this practice too must have occurred, as when printers shared the printing either of a work in large format and needed to make use of larger than usual headpieces or of a multi-volume work and wished to endow it with a uniform look. Richardson himself may provide an example of the latter: when in 1749 he employed two other presses to help with the second duodecimo edition of Clarissa no special size or design of ornament was called for, and yet, as Sale suggestively remarks, his `own headpieces are used in each volume' (p. 196). Fielding's Journal, however, was an ordinary duodecimo, notable only for the textual differences between the two 1755 editions. Because its ornaments are unremarkable for size, rarity, or beauty (factors that could otherwise help to account for their migration), it is hard to imagine why Strahan would have needed to borrow them from Richardson. Therefore, borrowing also seems improbable as an account for what happened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Another explanation for Strahan's use of Richardson printing materials arises from two entries in one of Strahan's less consulted ledgers. In one record in this miscellany of printing accounts from the early 1750s through 1776, 18 Strahan charged `Mr. Richardson' in April 1750 for `Working 3000 Chambers Sig. 2P, 2F' the sum of 2 pounds 2 shillings, that is at one guinea per sheet, and on the second of March 1752 Strahan charged `Mr. Richardson' for `Working' eight signatures of the same work and at the same price. (The reference is to the seventh edition of Chambers' Cyclopaedia, in two volumes, dated 1751 and 1752. The work is described in Appendix 2.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The term `working' is not to be loosely understood as a synonym for `Printing', a term properly referring to both composition and presswork. Strahan meant by `working' that he was charging Richardson only for presswork. 19 Had Strahan's men performed the setting as well as the presswork, he would have written `Printing' (or simply, as he very often did, omitted the term altogether), and his charges would have been nearly twice as high.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That Strahan's charge to Richardson of one guinea a sheet applied only to presswork is proved by comparison with Bowyer's charge for a very similar product, and confirmed by direct analysis. Bowyer printed part of several editions of the Cyclopaedia between 1738 and 1756. However, in the case of the second edition of 1738 the costs of composition and presswork are itemised in the Bowyer wages book and can be measured against his final charge per sheet of 38 shillings a sheet. Bowyer paid his compositors 13 s. for composition and 9 s. 4 d. for working 2,000 copies (at the usual rate of 1 s. 2 d. per token of 250 perfected sheets). 20 He was apparently following the common method of charging applied to large edition quantities, which allowed for a slightly larger profit to compensate for the greater wear on materials and equipment. This involved charging for 1,000 copies and adding a flat 5 s. for each additional 500 copies, which in this instance should have made the price per sheet 39 s. 9 d. made up as follows: 13 s. 0 d. (composition), 2 s. 2 d. (correction), 4 s. 8 d. (presswork for first 1,000), 9 s. 11 d. (master's half of the three previous charges), plus 10 s. (for second 1,000). William Bowyer's actual charge of 38 s. for this large multi-volume folio was no doubt reached by agreement with the copyright shareholders. 21 These figures demonstrate that if Strahan had charged Richardson for both composition and presswork his price per sheet would have been over 40 s. and not about half that sum.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An analysis of Strahan's actual charge of 21 shillings further supports my argument. He must have reached this sum simply by multiplying by twelve the regular rate of 1 s. 2 d. for a token in order to reckon the cost of presswork for 3000 copies, and then adding fifty per cent for his master's share.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A reasonable inference is that on these two occasions Richardson sent formes comprising type matter set by his compositors to Strahan whose press-men worked the total number of copies ordered by the bookseller. Transport within the city would have required care, but would not have been difficult. The point was made by John Smith in The printer's grammar, a work printed by Richardson in 1755: `Our Form, or Forms, being now lock'd up, and become portable' (p. 271). Richardson would have had good reason for such an arrangement. In his day edition quantities usually ranged between 500 and 1,000, and a balance between composition and presswork would have been sought on this basis. Much larger edition quantities would have tended to strain pressroom resources, especially if haste was required. If it was not convenient to employ more pressmen, and not wise to disappoint a customer, either through delay or by declining the work offered, it would have made sense for a printer to send out formes of his own setting to be printed off elsewhere. Was this a common practice? Certainly the preconditions existed, including the strong links which one printer had with another. But although subcontracting or “outwork” of composition and/or presswork is common practice nowadays, I have found no other evidence for it in the eighteenth century. Nothing in the ledgers of the Bowyers, of Charles Ackers, or, so far as I can see, elsewhere in the Strahan ledgers points to such an arrangement. Conceivably bibliographical analysis of features such as press figures could indicate responsibility for presswork, but such determinations promise to remain difficult.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Might it then be possible that the presence of Richardson's ornaments in Strahan's sheets of Fielding's Journal could be accounted for by Richardson having set type that Strahan printed? Several difficulties arise with that explanation. First, Strahan's charges per sheet, of £1 15 s. for Humphrys and £1 13 s. for Francis, exactly match the anticipated cost of composition and presswork combined rather than of presswork alone. Moreover, hypothesizing this arrangement requires a series of additional conjectures as well. The presence of one of the ornaments, T1, in a Strahan publication three years before the Journal would have to be separately explained. Likewise would the reappearance of ornaments after the Francis edition in the reset Humphrys one and the reset half-sheet: either Strahan returned the formes to Richardson, who then a couple of times provided new ones, with the same ornaments, to Strahan (as he also might then have done for Strahan's use of ornament H1 in 1760), or Strahan removed the ornaments presumably before returning the formes to Richardson. The latter scenario is particularly unlikely, for to extract the ornaments from well-locked formes would have been to risk squabbling the whole type matter in transit. The increasing complexity of the speculation increases the attractiveness of an alternate theory—that Strahan had these ornaments available in his own shop.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A hint of how this might have occurred, other than through the borrowing considered earlier, arises from an unpublished notebook once owned by the London printer Ichabod Dawks. In 1704 Dawks recorded that he had sold type and cases to fellow London printer, Richard Janeway the younger. 22 If type, why not ornaments too? When in 1732 William Bowyer sold some fonts of used type to his friend George Faulkner in Dublin, a few Bowyer ornaments went with the shipment, and appeared thereafter in works printed by Faulkner. 23 Perhaps Richardson at one time or other likewise suited himself and obliged Strahan by selling the latter a quantity of type. And, espe- cially if this included standing type, a few ornaments might have made part of the transaction. After some thirty years as a master, Richardson had more than enough ornaments, and many of the older ones were falling out of fashion. He would not have bothered to sell them by themselves, but might not have cared if some were included in a sale of type. What reason could Richardson have had for disposing of type? His was a `Printing-house the most compleat', so John Smith informed his readers in 1755 (p. iv), by `compleat' meaning stocked with a wide range of types. The disadvantage of such completeness was the difficulty of housing so much and so heavy a material, especially in old premises. On 26 November 1755 Richardson complained to Stinstra, `I am greatly over-stock'd, at present with all Sorts; and want to reduce my very great Weight'. 24 He had perhaps already made some effort to lessen the accumulated weight of type metal before he shifted to his new printing house, which he did in the summer of 1755, while Strahan for his part had only two years previously expanded his premises and capacity to print. Richardson could have chosen to return any badly worn fonts to the founder, but at scrap metal prices. To dispose of still usable types it would have made more sense to sell, probably at a better price, to another printer. Such transactions may well have occurred more often than is known. 25</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What were the relations between Richardson and Strahan that the two should do business together in such ways? Their correspondence is illuminating. On 9 March 1745 Strahan wrote to David Hall in Philadelphia: `Mr. Richardson... has turned out a good Friend, of which I leave you to judge, when I tell you that the work I have done within these Eight Months by his Recommendation, comes to upwards of £300'. 26 This may indicate that Richardson was not just sharing work with Strahan, but declining work with a recommendation that it be done by Strahan. (Was this because at particular times Richardson had too much work on hand to cope, or was he diverting some of his energy from his printing business to the writing of Clarissa? ) No doubt exists that Strahan cultivated so beneficial a relationship. On 17 August 1749 he writes fulsomely from Scotland to Richardson: `I esteem you as my friend, my adviser, my pattern, and my benefactor; I love you as my father; and let me, even me also, call you my Nestor'. 27</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It would be surprising if this intense client-patron relationship had endured, given Strahan's drive towards commercial success, and Richardson's increasing sensitivity over any threat, real or imagined, to the large business which he was very anxious to leave in good shape for the benefit of his wife and daughters. Strahan continued to carry out some work for Richardson in the early 1750s. In 1754, in an effort to frustrate the Dublin pirates of his work, Richardson called in seven other printers including Strahan to help with the third edition of Sir Charles Grandison. 28 However, after 1754 tangible evidence of cooperation between the two men has not been found, even although Richardson remained active as a printer until his death in 1761. There seems little doubt that some time in the 1750s their working relationship came to an end, whether before 1755 or later.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Evidence is circumstantial, but persuasive. In a letter of 2 April 1757 Richardson wrote to Erasmus Reich about his `Detection of a false &amp; ungrateful Friend'. 29 Sale judged that the false friend must have been Strahan, and Eaves and Kimpel were inclined to agree. 30 It was presumably the same friend whom Richardson harshly condemned in letters to Mrs Chapone of 27 June and 30 August 1758. Richardson wrote to her as follows: `A false and perfidious Scotchman [has been] pretending Friendship to me for Years, confessing all the time Obligation to me; constantly visiting me, tho' he had made secretly near a Year before he was detected, Offers of Circumvention and Underpricing, to one of my Friends in a principal Branch of my Business; Himself a prosper'd Man; a Friend he had never known, but for my Hospitality to him the Invader... This Man has already done me great Mischief; obliging me to lower Prices not too high for the Service; and goes on propagating the Mischief; And his View is, to interfere with my Family when I am no more; when I had so lately laid out great Sums of Money in Building for the better Convenience of carrying on this particular branch of Business, improved and, as I may say, established in my self and Family, by my honest Care and Industry.' 31 The description fits Strahan exactly, allowing for Richardson's emotive language. Who other than Strahan was a competitor in trade, a London printer, of Scottish extraction, prosperous and ambitious, and for many years a close friend and associate of Richardson's! Sale supposed that the particular branch of business might have been Richardson's printing for the House of Commons, his official printing that is, which was the only kind Sale knew of. There is another possibility. From his earliest days, long before he became the recognised printer to the House, Richardson had specialised in the printing of private bills, and Strahan, as his ledgers show, was printing more and more of these. 32</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Exactly when Richardson took fright at Strahan's competitive moves is not known. The tone of his letter to Mrs Chapone is heated enough to suggest a quite recent and sudden happening. The ornament evidence, fragmentary as it is, points to a date some two or three years earlier. However this may be, if Richardson did sell surplus type to Strahan, and with it a few ornaments, he is much more likely to have done so while they were still on good terms, perhaps not long before Strahan's printing of the first two editions of Fielding's Journal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This last attempted solution to the ornament problem has the merit of refusing to be disproved. Perhaps confirmation will yet be found among the many surviving volumes of Strahan ledgers. I have taken the matter as far as I can.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix 1 Notes on Ornaments in Francis, Humphrys, and the half-sheet reprint</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ornaments are listed, as above, by kind and order of their first occurrence in Francis and, in two instances, in Humphrys. Ornaments referred to as Richardson's, whether found in the 1755 editions of Fielding's Journal or elsewhere, are allotted the three- digit number to be adopted in my forthcoming study of Richardson as printer (thus R328). Strahan's ornaments have not been systematically studied.</field>

These two volumes (with Richardson headpiece R145, tailpieces R349, R384, R385, and factotum R484) were apparently entirely printed by Richardson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Other Strahan uses: A1 r (title) of volume 2 of Charlotte Lennox's Female Quixote, second edition (1752), which Strahan charged Millar for printing in April 1752—see Appendix 2.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Other Strahan uses: on B1 r of volumes 1 and 2 of Anne Steele's Poems... by Theodosia, which Strahan (ledger A, f. 126 v ) charged to James Buckland between January and April 1760 as `Poems by Theodosia', 34 sheets, 750 copies.

Strahan (ledger A, f. 104 v ) charged Andrew Millar in May 1754, for the `Case fairly stated', 3½ sheets, 500 copies. Other ornaments, not recognised as Richardson's, but presumably belonging to Strahan, occur in this work. Richardson had in fact turned down a request to print it, as he explained when answering the reverend Philip Skelton's reproaches for not proceeding fast enough with the printing of Skelton's Discourses: `I parted with three pieces of work; I put out to several printers the new `third' edition of my Grandison; took in help to the first edition of the seventh volume; I refused Dr. Leland's last piece' (3 April 1754, The correspondence of Samuel Richardson, ed.

In his second article de Castro printed the relevant entries from Strahan's ledger A, but without analysis. William B. Todd, in `Observations on the incidence and interpretation of press figures', Studies in Bibliography, 3 (1950), 171-205, in particular pp. 196-198, used press figures and watermark evidence to determine the method of imposition. For the best account of the textual problems of this work, see Hugh Amory, `The authority of the two versions of Fielding's Journal of a voyage to Lisbon', The culture of the book (Melbourne, Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand, 1999), pp. 182-200. In an appendix Amory summarised facts and problems to do with printing and publication. I am much obliged to him for encouraging me to grapple with the problems and for his help in my attempts at a solution. 11 Ledger A, ff. 104 v and 113 v (BL Add.

MSS 48803A). I am grateful to Dr Hugh Amory and Professor O M Brack for supplying photocopies of openings in this ledger. In these same two accounts Strahan also charged Richardson in March 1752 for printing a `Case relating to the Santa Catharina', 3 sheets pica, no. 250 and 60, and a `Road Act', 4 sheets, 8vo, no. 300, and 60; and in February 1754 for a `Road Bill for Leicester to Northampton', 6 sheets, no. 15, 25 and 150. My impression is that from the early 1750s Strahan was printing more and more private bills, a class of work then much expanding, and which Richardson deemed very much his speciality, given that he had been engaged in it from his earliest years. 19 Joseph Moxon prefers the usage `Work off', with past participle `wrought off', as in `he Works off the Reteration' ( Mechanick exercises on the whole art of printing, ed. H. Davis and H. Carter [1958], pp. 296-297). William Savage, in A dictionary of the art of printing (1841), uses `worked, or worked-off' to refer to the process whereby a `job, or the sheet of a work is printed' at press. In contrast the term `printing' is used to cover the range of processes that occur at the printing house. 20 See item 2610 (9 Oct. 1738) in The Bowyer ledgers. For printing charges and methods of arriving at them see Maslen, `Printing charges: inference and evidence', An early London printing house at work, pp. 91-96. 21 Had Bowyer adopted the more common method of charging used for shorter works he would have added one-sixth of the cost of composition for correction, and fifty per cent of the three costs of composition, correction and presswork as his master's share, thus reaching a total of 36 s. 9 d. 22 The Dawks-Bowyer-Nichols notebook, British Library of Political and Economic Science, MS.

The notebook is described in Maslen, `An editorial impasse: the Dawks-Bowyer-Nichols printer's notebook'. 23 In 1732 Bowyer sold Faulkner large quantities of pica and long primer, and from this date eight `Bowyer' ornaments begin to be used by the Dublin printer—see `George Faulkner and William Bowyer: the London connection', An early London printing house at work, pp. 223-233 (p. 230). 24 Slattery, p. 99. 25 It is well known that over many years Strahan himself sent printing materials, including type as well as books to his protégé David Hall in Philadelphia.

      <field name="heading_text">INTERRELATING THE CANCELLANTIA AND PARTIAL GATHERINGS IN THE FIRST EDITION OF EDWARD YOUNG'S THE CENTAUR NOT FABULOUS by James E. May</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Edward Young's prose satire and homily The Centaur Not Fabulous was published in 1755 and reprinted twice in revised editions that year. It was a sufficiently popular work—often enough reprinted and translated—to deserve bibliographical and textual scrutiny. 1 The work is also of interest be- cause of the collaborative involvement of its printer, Samuel Richardson. Richardson's friendship with Young led to an extraordinarily patient and on-going pre- publication revision of the edition, encouraging bibliographical complexities and affording us the correspondence that partly records the work's growth. Last minute revisions to the first edition led to an errata list (on the back of the title-page) with nine corrections, a manuscript correction to all copies, and the cancellation of at least ten leaves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letters between Young and Richardson record many major developments in the revision and printing of The Centaur. On 14 July 1754, Young wrote Richardson that he had something “about the length of five sermons” that he wished to publish with Richardson's assistance. 2 He sent Richardson his draft of its satirical dedication on 21 July 1754, remarking “Blot, add, alter, as you please; and, if then you approve it, print it” (Pettit, 405). On 28 July Young, estimating the manuscript's length as that of “five or six sermons,” proposed sending “not all the copy at once, but letter after letter, being four in all [five would be published],” and on 1 August he promised to send “the first letter” four days later (Pettit, 407). Richardson responded on 5 August with thoughts about the difficulty of pricing individual pamphlets, persuading Young to publish the Letters as a single unit and, perhaps, encouraging him to expand the text (Pettit, 408-409). Richardson then assured Young that, although he would “attend, as you desire, to the copy.... You shall see every proof,” and Richardson added, “I will send you a proof of the dedication as soon as possible” (Pettit, 409-410). After Young wrote 12 August to request that Richardson find an artist to cut a frontispiece illustrating the modern centaur described in the dedication, the printing began, with Young sending copy in installments from late summer 1754 through January 1755 and Richardson returning proof sheets for Young's correction. Young worked slowly, requiring multiple proofs to revise, not just correct, his text. In apologizing to Richardson for “slovenly copy” on 1 August, Young remarked, “my eyes are bad; and I had rather compose two letters than write one” (Pettit 408; see also 412 on Young's needing his housekeeper Mary Hallows to read for him). The conclusion to the fifth and final letter is dated 29 November 1754, and the undated postscript defending the work's “mixture of Levity with Solemnity” (375) was only written after Richardson's next extant discussion of The Centaur, in a letter of 21 January 1755.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On 21 January, when the press had printed to sheet Z and probably to Aa, but certainly not the last five leaves with the end of “The Conclusion” and the five-page postscript, Richardson proposed substantial revision to the dedication, requiring “a few pages [be] cancelled... after some such manner as I have presumed to offer in a waste sheet of the print, which I enclose” (Pettit, 416). In addition, he offered detailed corrections, mostly verbal, on sixteen pages from pages 24 to 325 (D4 v to Z3 r ) of the first edition (Pettit, 416-417). Most of these corrections involve grammatical and phrasing errors that Richardson should have caught if he had carefully read proof earlier. Few of these changes were thought significant enough to require insertion into the first edition. Two corrections (to pages 24 and 92) made their way into the errata, and another resulted in the words “for their” being added in manuscript on page 131 of all copies. Richardson's corrections to pages 92, 158, 172, 207, 291, 307, and 325 were inserted into the second edition. In addition, Richardson's question whether too many points were not “crowded” into Letter V led to its division into Letters V and VI for subsequent editions. More significantly, Richardson remarked: In another impression methinks it were to be wished that all from, If this is a man of pleasure, p. 161, to, from a higher hand, p. 163, were omitted, as it interrupts, by ludicrous images, emotions that were nobly excited. For the same reason, suppose, in p. 163, were omitted the words, Fain would I bury &amp;c. to the end of the paragraph, real men, p. 164? (Pettit, 416-417) This remark led to the cancellation of leaves N1-N2 (pp. 161-164) and their replacement with an altered text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In apologizing for the liberty taken in printing a revised draft of the dedication, Richardson explained that, having “seen the whole together,” he was “apt to think that the reader is not sufficiently prepared in that dedication for the solemn and elevated subjects of the following letters” (Pettit, 416). Young, apparently the next day (“Wednesday”), approved these changes and asked that Richardson “alter, as you think good; and let not delay or expense be any objection to any thing now practicable.” And he particularly asked for help with “the close now sent” (Pettit, 418). Although the final paragraphs of “The Conclusion” might be termed a “close” (“now, my Friend, Farewell,” Cc1 v /370), Young probably refers to a manuscript version of the Postscript (Cc3 v -Dd1 v ), which directly addresses Richardson's objections on 21 January regarding excessive levity. Closing, he added, “I desire this last sheet [presumably sheet Bb] again before worked off” (Pettit, 418). When Young next wrote (“Sunday,” Pettit supposed the very next, 26 January), he returned Richardson's revised printing “for ye Dedication part,” requesting the cancellations required for Richardson's “most judicious Insertions.” He added that “Tomorrow I expect ye last Sheet, &amp; when I return yt, I shall... consult with you if the d[eletion]s p. 161 &amp;c: can be made in this Edition. Expence, if yt is all shall not hinder it” (Pettit, 419). Young approved cancellations in the dedication during the very week that the final five leaves of the book were sent to be set in type, and the contents of leaves N1-N2 were soon to be rewritten. Thus, some of the cancellations were likely to be impressed on the same sheet or sheets with the final five leaves of the book. During the next fortnight, prior to the book's being bound for its sale in the first days of March, Young had to rewrite at least leaves N1 and N2 and read proof for them and the final five leaves, and the press had to print these leaves along with sheet Bb and the cancellantia within the dedication. On 13 February (Pettit's conjecture for a “Th” date), six days before Robert Dodsley purchased for himself and Andrew Millar the copyrights on 19 February 1755 (document printed in Pettit, 599), Young had finished work on the first edition and turned to revising for the second (Pettit, 420-421).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Young and Richardson's correspondence prepares us for finding that some leaves in the B sheet (containing the dedication) as well as N1 and N2 are cancels. But nothing in the correspondence refers to three other canceled leaves, R1, R2, and U1. T. C. Duncan Eaves and Ben D. Kimpel rightly perceived that these, in addition to N1 and N2, were cancels, and they correctly identified two of the five cancellantia in gathering B when they claimed, “Three pages of the dedication (iii, viii, xi) were certainly reset since they are short by one or two lines.” 3 However, as will be shown, although leaves B2 and B6 (carrying pages iii and xi) were canceled, leaf B4 (with page viii) was not. The text cancels are easily detected since leaves N1.N2 and R1.R2 are folds, N2 and R2 are unsigned, N1.N2 have a different paper-stock from N3-N8, and the stubs of the cancellanda are more often than not visible. Eaves and Kimpel checked the press figures in a few copies and found the stubs of the obvious cancels, but they did not collate editions or scrutinize bibliographical features such as the paper-stock (nor as biographers would they have been expected to do so). They have left the task of identifying the cancels in the B gathering and of interrelating the cancels, singletons, and partial sheets in the edition. With evidence drawn from 58 copies (listed in Appendix 2, where abbreviated codes are noted), including an uncut copy at St. John's College, Cambridge, I will reconstruct the three final printed units of the book, placing 16 leaves that remained to be printed on 26 January on a whole sheet and on the halves of two other sheets. Scholars working on comparable cases of cancellation may find applicable the arguments drawn from press figures, point holes and dimensions of an uncut copy, watermarks and tranchefile patterns, and the position of chain-lines in many extant copies. The multiplicity of approaches and the many extant copies examined allow us to test the value of conclusions about imposition patterns drawn from chain-line positions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The edition has many partial gatherings and cancellatia: the frontispiece, a confusing nine- leaf B gathering, two cancellans folds in the text (N1.N2 and R1.R2, with material from Letter III and from the beginning of Letter V), half-sheet Cc 4 , and four singletons (title-leaf A 1, final leaf Dd1, and two cancels: B3 [with the third leaf of the preface] and U1 [with material from the “Thoughts for Age” section of Letter V]). As I shall argue, leaves A 1, B3, U1, and Dd1 completed a sheet containing Cc 4 ; cancellans folds in the B gathering that appear as if they are B2.B7 + 1 and B6.B7 were printed adjoined on half of a sheet; and cancellans folds N1.N2 and R1.R2 were both parts of a separate whole sheet. Thus, the octavo has the collational formula:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">8°: (frt +) A 1 B 8 (-B2, B3, B6, B7; B1 + χ 4 , with χ2-4 between B5 and B8 [appearing as B6, B7, B7 + 1]; χ1 + 2 χ1 [`B3'] C-M 8 N 8 (-N1,N2; + `N1'.N2 [= 3 χ 8 -6 leaves in- cluding `R1'.R2]) O-Q 8 R 8 (-R1,R2; + `R1'.R2 [= 3 χ 8 -6 leaves including `N1'.N2]) S-T 8 U 8 (± `U1') X-Bb 8 Cc 4 Dd1; $1-4 (-N2, R2) signed; cancellans χ 1 and 2 χ 1 missigned “B2” and “B3”]; 200 leaves; pp. [ 4 (frontispiece and title-page)] i-xvi [2 (section title)] I 2-53 54-56 57-221 222-224 225-378. [ Note. Although for clarity I have not embedded the information in the collational formula, the reconstruction proposed in this paper would create a Cc 8 sheet containing leaves A 1, B3, U1, and Dd1 positioned as follows: A 1=Cc3, B3=Cc7, U1=Cc2, and Dd1=Cc6, with the leaf signed `Cc2' occurring in the position of Cc4.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First, I need offer some prefatory observations on the paper-stocks and their watermarks. The edition was printed in common octavo imposition, with the watermark appearing principally on either leaves $1 and $4 or on $2 and $3, and tranchefiles (which produce narrower chain- widths at the shorter sides of the sheet) sometimes on the first four leaves of the gathering but never the last four. All four paper-stocks employed in The Centaur (each produced from a pair of nearly identical moulds) have watermarks, and three have tranchefiles. The dominant paper-stock (also the sole paper-stock in the second edition) has a single “NH” watermark (no sheet of any copy has been seen with double marks). The 14 mm-tall letters are divided by a chain-line; the “N” has single-lined verticals and a double-lined diagonal; the “H” is entirely double-lined. This paper-stock has fairly distinct chain-lines slightly wider than those in other paper-stocks in the book, four chain-widths usually measuring 104-107 mm. It has one tranchefile space of 12-14 mm at both short sides of the sheet (seen regularly in the uncut Csj copy and in many copies only slightly trimmed). The three other paper-stocks all have fleur-de-lys watermarks centered on chain- lines, “IV” countermarks, and more distinct, or easily visible, chain-lines 25-25.5 mm wide. The three are distinguishable from each other by differences in the shape and size of their fleur-de-lys watermarks. One fleur-de-lys paper-stock is found in sheets E and N of all copies; a second is found in sheet Q and the frontispiece of all copies. Of concern to us is the third fleur-de-lys paper-stock, found in folds B1.B8 and B4.B5. Unlike the other paper- stocks, it lacks a tranchefile. The watermark has a broad tail the size of that in the first paper-stock (23-24 mm across), but a broader head (17.5-19 mm across), sometimes asymmetrically larger on one side of the chain-line. Both the “NH” and fleur-de-lys watermarks are placed so close to the short exterior edge that they almost never appear on the four internal leaves of the sheet, and the “NH” is usually seen on only one of the exterior leaves of the short axis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That said, let us consider the book's preliminaries, correcting Eaves and Kimpel's remarks on the cancellantia in gathering B. The frontispiece, with a fleur-de-lys paper-stock, and title-leaf ( A 1), with the “NH” stock, are disjunct. The frontispiece was almost certainly printed by itself and not with an earlier, canceled title- page without an errata list since watermarks appear in the frontispiece sometimes at the top outside corner (as in C, CtY, FU, MH1, MiU, OTH) and sometimes at the top inside (as in MH2, NcU, Ose, and ViWCF). All copies seen have an errata list on A 1 v . As originally printed, the title-page was followed by a dedication occupying leaves B1-B7, with a sec- tion title to Letter I completing the B sheet, but, as revised to accommodate Richardson's suggestions of 21 January, the dedication required an additional leaf after B5 v . As published, the nine-leaf unit with dedication and section title contains four folds, two enveloping (B1 and section title B8, and B2.B7 + 1 [χ1.χ4]) and two back to back (B4.B5 and B6.B7 [χ2.χ3]), and a disjunct leaf, `B3' ( 2 χ1), glued in. Two original folds, B1.B8 and B4.B5, are distinguished by a fleur-de-lys paper-stock. Fold B4.B5 is regularly seen conjugate, and the section title to Letter I is folded improperly so as to precede B1 and seen conjugate to it in ten copies (CaOTU, CLU-C, MB, MH2, O, OAU, Ose, PSt, TnU and TxU). Leaves B1 and B4 frequently have complementary halves of the watermark (as in C, CoU, InU, L, LU, MdBJ, MR1, MR3, O, OCU, Ose, and WU) or of the countermark (as in CaAEU, CaOTU, DLC, LdU-B, May, MH2, NRU, Occ, OTH, Owo, TnU, and Wns). Furthermore, in no copies does the same portion of the watermark appear in both B1 and B4. Thus, it is evident that the folds of which they are parts were formerly adjoined at the top as one half of the original B sheet. Within the B cancellantia, enveloping fold B2.B7 + 1 is seen conjugate in LdU-B, May, OCiU, and O-HF copies, and back-to-back fold B6.B7 is regularly seen conjugate. All five cancellantia are printed on the paper-stock with “NH” watermark, also found in the cancellantia within the text. Whereas the type- settings for the pages with fleur-de-lys stock are all reset for the second edition, those on the cancellantia with the “NH” paper-stock (B2-B3 and B6-B7 + 1) are not reset for that edition but reappear on B1-B2 and B5-B7, again on the “NH” paper-stock. 4 From this fact, the signatures, and the errata change for page ii (B1 r ), we can be certain the two folds on the fleur-de-lys stock are not the cancellantia but part of the original gathering.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since, in addition to the title-leaf and the B cancellantia, the “NH” paper- stock is also found in the cancels within the text (N1.N2, R1.R2, and U1) and in the five final leaves (Cc 4 + Dd1), we have sixteen leaves to interrelate, the sixteen likely to be those last printed (if R1.R2 and U1 were also late alterations). For the sake of efficiency, Richardson would presumably have wished to print these sixteen leaves on as few units as possible, ideally on two sheets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The press figures offer some guidance in hypothesizing what leaves were printed with what others. 5 For the 16 leaves of cancellantia and partial units, press figures appear in all copies on B7+1 r (figure 7), R2 r (figure 2), and both sides of leaf Cc3 (Cc3 r -1 and Cc3 v -4). Note that four different figures, potentially presses or teams of pressmen, were involved in printing the final units of the book. This may suggest that multiple presses were at once printing off the final leaves during early February, as the work was hurriedly prepared for the binders. In the preceding sheets of the edition (C-Bb), the same figure sometimes recurs in sequential sheets, as in sheets H-I (3), O-P (3), and X-Z (1), and figure 7 appears on the inner forme of sheet Aa (with figure 2 on its outer forme) and as the sole figure in Bb. Since cancellans B7+1 r also has figure 7, we can presume that the cancellans folds in B were not printed until February, for on 26 January Young was expecting the return of sheet Bb the next day for his approval (Pettit, 419).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The four press figures exclude certain possibilities. The two figures in Cc 4 suggest that it was not produced with its eight page-settings locked in the chase and the sheet perfected from the same forme but that Cc 4 was printed with four other leaves. Half-sheet Cc's two figures support the hypothesis that Cc 4 was printed with the singletons, for were the two cancellans folds in B or were R1.R2 printed with it, the sheet would be figured three times. Also indicated is that pages B7+1 r and R2 r were not printed on the same side of the same sheet (as cancels they need not be both in the inner forme as the second and eighth rectos normally would be). There is no need to assume they were on different sides of the same sheet, for most sheets in this edition are not figured on both sides. Indeed, one might reason that, since the vast majority of whole sheets have a single figure, and since both R2 r and B7+1 r are figured, they were probably on separate sheets; however, that conjecture must be qualified since the sheet with Cc 4 , printed close to publication, has two figures. (Watermark evidence below will indicate that the B cancels were not printed with cancels N1.N2 and R1.R2.) Finally (although, atypically, sheet E and, after cancellation, sheet U are never found with a press figure), we can suppose it likely from the press's general figuring of sheets that the lack of a figure on the group of leaves A 1, B3, U1, and Dd1 indicates that they were not printed by half-sheet imposition but with other leaves on a sheet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">St. John's College, Cambridge, has an untrimmed copy in a contemporary binding providing both point-hole and diverse paper evidence about the printing of the sixteen leaves of cancellantia and other partial gatherings. 6 The leaves of the book are typically 212-213 mm tall (such as Cc1 and Cc2). dividing a sheet width of 425 mm, but individual leaves can vary in height from 208 (C5) to 217 (C8); leaves are typically 130 mm wide, though individuals vary from 124 to 138 mm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In The Centaur, the point holes (from pins in the tympan that pierced the paper along the short axis at the center of the forme) appear between 110-165 mm from the top of the leaf, with one 20-30 mm higher than the other. What Philip Gaskell records as a general practice is true of this and other octavos of Young's works printed by Richardson during the 1750s: the “near-side point was placed further in towards the middle of the tympan (and of the sheet).” 7 For instance, in the Csj copy, leaves C5 and C6 share a point hole at 148 mm down leaves 208 mm tall; C7 and C8 share a hole at 120 mm down leaves 217 mm tall. Of the cancellantia in gathering B, only the leaf appearing as if B7+1 (χ4) has a point hole. It appears as a hemispherical bite along the edge, 114 mm down from the top edge. Within the singletons, point holes are not found on cancellans B3 and Dd1. However, half-sheet Cc 4 , whose press figures suggests it may have been printed with these leaves, has point holes on Cc3 down 110 mm and on Cc4, down 153 mm. As for folds N1.N2 and R1.R2, R2 has a large hole at the edge, down 165-170 mm on a leaf 210 mm tall at the edge: a bite marking out 270 degrees of a circle is missing. On N2, along the edge at 165-170 mm down a leaf 210 mm tall at the outer edge, there is an outward flap that constitutes the contents or surplus of the point hole on the edge of R2. The bite and surplus are alike in size, shape and position. (If N2's flap were the surplus from a point hole on a leaf other than R2, it could not be from the other leaf in the same sheet with a point hole, for that hole would be closer to 110 mm down from the top of the leaf.) Furthermore, at 21 mm above the start of the bite on R2 and the surplus on N2, we find a small 1-mm nick in R2 and a compatible 1-mm knob on N2. It is evident that N2 lay along the edge of R2 at the center of a whole sheet, in a row of four leaves along the long axis of the sheet, with the recto of N2 adjacent to the verso of R2, as N1 v .N2 r .R2 v .R1 r . Since the point hole in leaf B7+1 is only 114 mm down from the top edge and that on N2 and R2 at 165 mm down could be the complementary hole, we might be tempted to suppose them a pair, but that inference is blocked by watermark evidence (soon to be offered) that B2.B7+1 and B6.B7 were adjoining at their top edges.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The untrimmed margins of the Csj copy provide other useful evidence. First, there are matching uneven edges produced during cutting and tearing apart of formerly adjacent paper into separate leaves. As with outer edges of leaves N2 and R2, there are deficits and surpluses in the ragged upper edges of B2 and B6 that indicate these leaves were formerly joined at the top. If we measure in from the outer edge on B2, we find that the leaf is short of the uniform top edge until 15 mm in toward the fold and then again from roughly 25-35 mm in, but B6 has a surplus from 0-15 and 25-35 mm in, making it taller than the uniform height. And from 55-70 mm in on that top edge occur two dips where B2 has a deficit below the uniform edge and B6 a surplus above it (the valleys in B2 and the hills in B6 match exactly when they are xeroxed and cut along the edge, and these images are laid against one another with one image up and the other down). In addition, matching hills and valleys along the top edge are also shared by Dd1 and B3, providing further support for their formerly adjoining at their top edges. At 1-3 mm in from their outer edges, there is a deficit on B3 and a surplus on Dd1; from 50 to 66 mm in, there is a rectilinear deficit on B3 and a comparable surplus on Dd1; and, from 66 to 90, there is a rectilinear surplus on B3 and a comparable deficit on Dd1.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In addition, since in the Csj copy the cancels and partials were not trimmed but only cut apart (as the point holes and watermarks testify), the leaves' dimensions provide further evidence of the leaves' positions in the sheets before division. The dimensions of the singletons support the arrangement hitherto argued: leaf A 1 is between 213-215 x 137 mm, and U1, 212-213 x 137 mm; Dd1 is 215 x 132 mm, and B3, 212-213 x 132 mm, providing normal dimensions for half of a sheet in this book, 425-430 x 269 mm. The shared widths of 137 mm for leaves A 1 and U1 and of 132 mm for leaves B3 and Dd1 suggest a cutting along the long axis of the half-sheet down a fold between two unequal halves. The shared heights of leaves A 1 and Dd1 and of leaves U1 and B3 suggest these leaves had received the same fold along their top edges before they were separated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Both the watermarks and the tranchefiles of the uncut Csj copy offer telling evidence. In this copy we find leaf A 1 with a tranchefile and a portion of the “NH” watermark that complement those on U1 (8-9 mm of the top of “N” and one vertical of “H” on A 1 and 4.5 mm of bottom of “N” and one vertical of “H” on U1); in addition, the chain- lines match up at the top of the page: at 12-13, 41, and 66 mm out from the spine on A 1 and 14, 42, and 68 mm on U1. (Since they are singletons glued to stubs, we cannot expect the chain-lines to appear at exactly the same distances out from the spine, but they should be close and the distances between the chain-lines should be proportional.) Similarly, we find comparable chain-line locations in B3 and Dd1 as if these leaves without watermark or tranchefile were adjoined at the top (10, 37, 64, 91 mm out from the spine on B3 vs. 13, 39, 66, 92 mm on Dd1). In line with our hypothesis that Cc 4 was printed on a whole sheet with the singletons, we note that Cc1 and Cc2 do not share a watermark (as they should not since it is on A 1 and U1), but they do share a tranchefile. It is also reassuring to note that the combined height of Cc1 over Cc2 measures 425 mm, the usual sheet width. Leaves B2 and B6, which we would like to show were printed together adjoining at the top, lack watermarks but both do have a tranchefile, 12-13 mm, and their chain-lines are a comparable distance from the spine (B2: 10-11, 36-37, 64-65 mm; B6: 9, 36, 62 mm). The chain-line distances on leaves B7 and B7+1 are also compatible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paper evidence involving the leaf sizes and watermark of folds N1.N2 and R1.R2 supports the point-hole evidence in placing the folds on the same sheet's long axis: N1.N2.R2.R1. There are no surpluses or deficits along the top edges of these folds that suggest they were adjoined at their top edges; in fact, the reverse is true: the top edge of N1, from the outer edge to 18 mm inward, is raised a full one wire-line taller (1-2 mm) above the general height of the leaf, and there is no comparable dip near the outside along the top of R1. Moreover, leaf R1 has 9 mm of the watermark's “N” showing, but none of the watermark shows on N1. This being an untrimmed copy, we would expect at least several mm of watermark, perhaps as many as 5 mm, to be visible there. It might be objected that a cancellans fold like N1.N2 was the product of scissored cutting, not the opening of a folded whole sheet, and so some trimming could have occurred. However, all the other cancellantia and partial gatherings have not been trimmed but only cut, and there is no reason for the binder to have done additional trimming for leaves N1.N2 since these leaves are shorter on the bottom edge and have their running-titles slightly above those adjacent. Furthermore, the dimensions of leaves N1.N2 and R2.R1 suggest they were all cut from the whole sheet with a single cutting along the long axis. Leaf N1 is only 208 mm tall for the most part; N2 is 208 close to the fold and grows to 210 at the edge; R2 is 210 near its outer edge and grows to 211-212 near the fold; R1 is 210-211 near the fold and 213 at the outer edge. Thus, the heights of all four leaves progress with a single movement from 208 on N1 to 213 at the outer edge of R1. The same slanting cut is evident if one considers the upper margin above the running titles: the space from the running title to the top edge on N1 is 20.5 mm, on N2 21.5, on R2 23.1, and on R1 (above the bracketed page number) 23.5. In addition, the combined distances between the running titles and the top edges on N1 and R1 total 44 mm, a total white space between type-settings that is comparable to the figures for B3 and Dd1 (45) and for B2 and B6 (45). If N1 and R1 were joined at the top edge, and if the 5 mm of missing watermark were cut from N1, then the running titles would have had roughly 4 mm more space between them than we find elsewhere in the book. All the evidence suggests N1 was untrimmed and lacks a watermark and so was not printed above R1.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Watermarks, tranchefiles, and chain-lines in all the trimmed copies seen confirm as a general pattern what is true of the uncut St. John's copy and consonant with press figure evidence: the leaf-pairs A 1/U1 and Dd1/B3 were joined at their top edges in the same half-sheet; the singletons' half-sheet was printed on a whole sheet with Cc 4 ; folds B2.B7+1 and B6.B7 were printed on the same half of a sheet; and N1.N2 and R1.R2 were not joined at the top to form a half-sheet but ran laterally across a full sheet. In addition, this evidence from the paper of all copies indicates that leaves A1 and U1 were printed at the outside of the sheet and that the inside edge of A1 was conjugate with Dd1, just as that of U1 was with B3. Also, the watermarks and tranchefiles apparent in many copies and the chain-line positions in most copies will confirm what is true of the Csj copy: disjunct leaves and partial gatherings printed on the same individual sheets of paper ended up in the same copy of The Centaur. Indeed, demonstrating the imposition pattern for the sheets last printed also involves demonstrating this uniform procedure in the binding shop. It allows the evidence from the uncut Csj copy to be applied safely to other copies of the book. Finally, confirming the imposition pattern with evidence from most extant copies rules out the possibility of multiple imposition patterns caused by interrupting the press run to reimpose on a single sheet the four-leaf units with the cancellantia in the dedication and the text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Given that the vast majority of extant copies have been examined, we can generalize with some confidence regarding which problematic leaves may have tranchefiles and watermarks and which may not. Tranchefiles have been seen in some copies on A 1, B2, B6, N1, R1, and U1, and five of these leaves (all but B6) have tranchefiles in the TnU copy. The six leaves with tranchefiles have been seen with watermarks also. In no copy does a tranchefile appear in leaves B3, Dd1, N2, and R2. In no copy does a watermark appear in leaves B3, Dd1, N2, and R2 without it also appearing more fully in leaves A 1, U1, N1, and R1—leaves that are or were formerly adjoining and that commonly have tranchefiles and so were at the exterior of the sheet's short side. Usually with this paper-stock, the small watermark appears only in the two leaves at the same exterior side and is not shared by the next leaves in. However, in the LdU-B and WU copies, the double-lined base of one of the verticals of the “H” appears on leaf B3, and in these copies we find the “N” on leaf U1, suggesting U1 and B3 were conjugate and share the same watermark. Also, in the FU and NcU copies, the double-lined base of the “H” appears on Dd1, and in these copies we find the “N” visible on A 1, suggesting A 1 and Dd1 were conjugate and share the same watermark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ample watermark evidence testifies that at their upper edges leaf A 1 adjoined U1 and Cc1 adjoined Cc2. Eleven copies examined have watermarks divided in a complementary manner of tops and bottoms between A1 and U1: Csj, DLC, FU, LdU-B, LU, MnU, MR1, MR2, NBiU, NSbSU, and TxU. In no copy does the extent of the watermark on one leaf rule out the possibility that the mark is part of the same one showing in the other leaf. Also, in no copy do we find the same portion of the watermark on both leaves A 1 and U1. Also, as will be noted below, when a copy has a watermark only on either A 1 and U1, the watermark often fails to complement watermarks found on other partials and cancels. Similarly, Cc 4 appears to be a regular half-sheet from complementary watermark halves shared by leaves Cc1 and Cc2 in at least ten copies (CaOTU, CSmH, MH[2], MiU, Occ, Ose, OTH, Owo, and PSt).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Additional evidence on the placement of A 1, U1, and all the disjunct leaves and partial gatherings can be drawn from chain-line position. Above I found it useful to note the matching chain-line positions on A 1 and U1, as on B3 and Dd1, of the uncut Csj copy. Similar evidence confirming my hypotheses can be drawn from all the copies examined. Moreover, since in this edition we have other strong evidence from watermark and tranchefile patterns and from the uncut Csj copy for the imposition patterns within three sheets, we can test the value of evidence from chain-line position. Although there is nothing novel about employing chain-line position to situate conjugate folds and disjunct leaves on a reconstructed sheet, The Centaur offers an ideal case for applying the method systematically. For here we have good confirmation from other more reliable evidence, and measurements can and have been obtained from a large number of extant copies. Furthermore, every case is unique: here we are working in octavo on disjunct leaves both at the exterior edge and within the sheet and also on conjugate folds; also, we have a paper stock that has regular spacings between chain-lines and comparable spacings between the tranchefile and closest chain-line at both ends of the sheet. Because of the regularity of the chain-widths, when examining copies I often neglected to record chain-line positions across the entire leaf. Yet I believe the position of the closest chain-line to the spine will be shown useful in situating disjuncts and partial gatherings in editions without watermarks or tranchefiles and for which there are no uncut copies or copies with offset.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In common octavo imposition, one notes how the chain-line positions on leaves adjoining at their top edges ($1 and $4, $5 and $8, $6 and $7, and $2 and $3) are very similar relative to the spine fold (or to the outer edge). Accordingly, with octavos (as with folios) the distance of chain-lines out from the spine can be used to argue that unmarked leaves were contiguous at their top edge or along the inner or outer edge before the sheet was cut apart. Note that this also allows us to situate on an octavo sheet leaves that were never part of a conjugate fold but were adjacent at their outer edges at the center of the sheet's long axis where the point holes are located (where I am hypothesizing N2 and R2 were adjoined). Although chain-line position would be more useful if the “NH” paper-stock had chain-widths widely varying, nonetheless it is worth considering. The evidence will be more significant for the second leaf in from the exterior of the sheet, since, the further in, the more the variations of chain-widths will accrue. The value of chain-line position is stronger for matching two folds (as B2.B7+1 with B6.B7) than for matching singletons glued to stubs (as A 1 with U1)—and not just because twice as many chain-lines are involved. The distance out for the first chain-line on two singletons will vary with the fashion in which the two leaves are attached, whether folded to form a stub that can be sewn or glued on to an old stub or adjacent leaf. Also, one must expect misinformation and anomalies to creep in even if one takes measurements with the same strategy and keeps careful records. 8 Finally, it would be best to record the position of all chain-lines on the leaves so that irregular or varying chain- widths can aid identification.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Appendix 1 with chain-line positions within 42 copies indicates, the distances from the spine of the closest chain-line to it in leaves A 1 and U1 of the same copy differ on average 1.88 mm (see the third last measurements in the tables of Appendix 1; these differences total 79 mm for the 42 copies). In all but three copies the distance of the chain-lines from the spine on leaves A 1 and U1 is within 4 mm of each other (in May the first chain-line out from the spine on A 1 is 12-13 mm away, but on U1 it is 9; in Occ, A 1: 11-12 vs. U1: 5-6; and in OCU, A 1: 10-11 vs. U1: 17 [only OCU is rebound]). The first chain-lines from the spine on B3 and Dd1 at the top edge differ on aver- age 1.77 mm in their distances to the spine (note the second last measurements in the tables; these differences total 74.5 mm in the 42 copies). In all but six copies the distance of the chain-lines from the spine on B3 and Dd1 is within 4 mm of each other (in May, B3: 11 vs. Dd1: 18; in MdBJ, B3: 6-7 vs. Dd1: 11; in OAU, B3: 11-12 vs. Dd1: 16; in Occ, B3: 20 vs. Dd1: 14; in OCU, B3: 12-13 vs. Dd1: 6-7; and in PSt, B3: 15 vs. Dd1: 10 [only OCU is rebound]). It is noteworthy that the four copies with greatly differing chain-line positions on A 1 and U1 are among these six. Although these anomalies may result from some copies' having A 1 and U1, or B3 and Dd1, from different sheets, they are more likely caused by vagaries in the size of the leaf as cut, the depth glued inward, and the slanting or bending of the chain-lines. For instance, in my own copy of the edition, when I measure the distance of first chain-lines from the spine to the outer edges on leaves B3 and Dd1, I find the distance to be, respectively, 114 and 106 mm (of a copy trimmed 125 mm wide for B3 and 124 for Dd1), indicating that there is 11 mm to the spine on B3 and 18 on Dd1. However, this apparent disparity is actually caused by the insertion of B3 with a stub wrapping around and appearing 7 mm out from the fold after leaf B5; leaf Dd1, on the other hand, is glued to leaf Cc4. If B3 were glued in even with the fold, and the leaf trimmed accordingly, the first chain-lines out from the spine on B3 and Dd1 would be 107 and 106 from the outer edge, and the distances from the spine to the closest chain-lines would be 17 for both. Some of the other copies with chain-line positions breaking the pattern have irregularities in their binding, such as the rebound OCU copy, where A1 is attached to a conservation stub, and perhaps these copies should be excluded from consideration. Also, one might turn to the distances between chain-line across the leaf when disparities occur in the position of the first chain- line. Thus, in the PSt copy where B3 and Dd1 are 5 mm apart, one might find evidence that these leaves were adjoined at the top edge by noting that chain-lines appear out from the spine at regular distances on both: B3: 15, 42, 68, 95, and 120 mm; Dd1: 10, 38, 63-64, 90, and 115 mm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In addition, if, as hypothesized here, leaves A 1.Dd1 and U1.B3 were conjugate pairs prior to the separation of a half-sheet, then the distances from the spine to the closest chain-lines in each pair should add up to roughly 25.5-27 mm, the general range of the spaces between chain-lines. In fact, we find that the first chain-lines out from the spine usually total approximately 26 mm (see respectively fifth and fourth last measurements in the tables). Since the chain-widths can vary a millimeter from 26 mm and since my own measurements are subject to one mm of error for each measurement, we might consider any total within 4 mm of 26 an instance arguing the singletons were once conjugate folds. All the totals for the first chain-lines from the fold on A 1 and Dd1 are within 4 of 26 mm except the May copy by.5 mm (21.5 mm) and the rebound OCU copy (17). The totals of the first chain- lines out on B3 and U1 are within 4 mm of 26 except for MdBJ (17.5) and, off by 1 mm, rebacked OTH (20). (With B3's stub factored in, the May is no longer an exception.) Totals a little short of the usual chain-width are easily explained" by trimming or folding the disjunct leaf before gluing or sewing it into place. If the chain-lines in this paper-stock were not as straight and evenly spaced as they are, we might argue from chain-line position alone that leaf Dd1 was attached to A 1 and B3 was attached to U1. Because the chain-lines in this paper-stock are so regularly close to 26 mm apart, this argument that A 1 was attached to Dd1 and U1 was attached to B3 is all the stronger—perhaps strong enough on its own to situate them on a half-sheet. Of course, in determining the imposition pattern of The Centaur we only look for confirmation from chain-line position for we have considerable watermark evidence as well, such as from four copies with watermarks on Dd1 and B3 that the Dd1 leaf was conjugate to A 1 and B3 was to U1. But the evidence from watermarks and tranchefiles, and from the Csj copy, corroborates the evidence of chain-line position and attests its potential value.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There is substantial watermark evidence that leaves B2 and B6 were adjoining at the top edge. First, there is the converse evidence that in none of 58 copies examined does the same portion of the watermark appear on both B2 and B6. More importantly, complementary halves of the watermark appear on B2 and B6 in eleven copies: CaAEU, CaOTU, CoU, CSmH, MdBJ, NjP, NRU, O, Occ, Owo, and TnU. Additional support for supposing B2 and B6 were printed adjoined at their top edges comes from the matching position of chain-lines at the top of these leaves and of their conjugates, B7 and B7+1. In 41 of 42 copies measured for Appendix 1, the measurements of the first chain-lines out from the spine on B2 and B6 (as on B7 and B7+1) fall within 2 mm of each other (they are 3 mm off in CoU); the average distance is under 1 mm (41 mm total difference divided by 42 copies).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although the uneven outer edges of leaves N2 and R2 in the Csj copy indicate these edges were formerly conjugate in that copy, let us still test other paper evidence on the placement of these folds. Since the tranchefiles in the “NH” stock are comparable in width at both sides of the sheet, those on N1 and R1 match in the Csj copy and 13 other copies (C, CaOTU, CtY, FU, MR1, NBiU, NcU, NIC, NRU, O, Oa, TnU, and Wns). As with the tranchefile evidence, some watermark evidence could mislead us into hypothesizing that the two folds were adjoining at their top edges. For instance, not a single copy has the same portion of the watermark on N1 and R1, which would rule out the hypothesis that they were imposed with top edges adjoining. However, the absence of any watermarks shared by leaves N1 and R1 supports paper-tear and dimension evidence that N1.N2 and R1.R2 were adjoined, not at their upper edges, but at the outer edges of N2 and R2. The absence of any matches is striking. Since one-fifth of the copies seen show watermarks shared by leaves A 1 and U1 (11 copies), by leaves B2 and B6 (11), and by leaves Cc1 and Cc2 (10), we might expect to see at least one copy with watermarks shared by N1.N2 and R1.R2 if those folds had been adjoining at the top. We should particularly expect to see watermarks on both N1 and R1 in large copies like that at O, where 7-8 mm of the “NH” watermark often appears, divided between two leaves sharing a watermark; yet, at O, R1 has only 4 mm of watermark, but none appears on N1 (nor can we suppose the watermark is lost in the fold on N1 since their chain-lines are only a few mm off from matching at the top).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In addition, since, whenever either N1 or R1 has a watermark, the other does not, and since more than half the copies have a watermark on either leaf N1 or R1, we can infer that the two leaves were probably printed at opposite ends of the same sheet. In the 58 copies examined, I recorded watermarks on N1 in 27 or 28 copies (CaOHM, CoU, ICN1, L, LdU-B, LU, May, MH2, MoU, MR1, MR3, N, NcU, NIC, NjP, NRU, NSbSU, Oa, Ose, OTH, Owo, PSt, RPB, TnU, ViWCF, Wns, WU; possibly CaOTU) and on R1 in 15 or 16 copies (CLU-C, Csj, CSmH, CSt, DLC, The Hague, MdBJ, MH1, MiU, NBiU, O, OAU, Occ, O-HF, TxU and possibly MB). I still found 42 to 44 of 58 copies examined to have the watermark on either N1 or R1 but never on both. Watermarks, thus, appear on N1 or R1 in a high percentage of the total copies seen: roughly 75%. That is a very high percentage when one considers that I probably failed to identify one or two and that watermarks were commonly trimmed off. There are copies cut short enough that no watermark appears in the sheet with the singletons and Cc4, such as CSt (194), CtY (195), NeU (194), and OCU (194)—indeed, no watermark appears in any cancellantia or partial gathering of CtY. Since three quarters of the copies seen have a watermark in N1 or R1, it is likely that N1 and R1 were at the two opposite ends of one sheet, with one receiving the watermark when the other did not. That may be inferred from how much greater the total 42-44 is than the total number of copies with watermarks in the singletons half-sheet (27 copies, possibly 28), the half-sheet formed by folds B2.B7+1 and B6.B7 (26 copies), or the half-sheet Cc 4 (24 copies). 9 Indeed, the total number of copies with watermarks on leaves N1 or R1 is comparable to the total with watermarks on the sheet comprising the singletons and Cc1-Cc4, 51 (possibly 52).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since N1.N2 and R1.R2 were not positioned head to head but side by side, N1 and R1 on different ends of the sheet, chain-line positions in those leaves provide a good check against the value of chain-line position as used above for evidence that two cancellans leaves or folds were formerly adjoined at the top edge. As the tables indicate, there is less evidence from chain-line positions that N1.N2 and R1.R2 were adjoined at the top than there was for the singletons and the B cancellantia. There is greater than 4 mm difference in the positions of the first chain-lines from the fold on N1 and R1 in 9 of 42 copies: InU (7-8 mm), May (5), MiU (11-12), MR1 (4-5), NSbSU (6-7), OAU (4-5), Ose (7), PSt (5), and WU (5), and the difference is 4 mm in three others (CtY, LdU-B, and MH2). Only three copies had 4 mm of disparity between chain-line positions on AI and U1, and none did for B2 and B6. On average the positions of the first chain-lines from the fold on N1 and R1 are 2.54 mm apart (107 mm total for 42 copies); whereas, the averages for disjuncts A 1 and U1 and for disjuncts B3 and Dd1 are under 2 mm (1.88 and 1.77 respectively). More to the point, however, is comparison with the folds B2.B7+1 and B6.B7, since as conjugate folds they, like N1.N2 and R1.R2, would have been sewn in: the average difference between chain-line positions on B2 and B6 was under 1 mm. Still, the position of chain-lines on N1 and R1 has not offered valuable evidence that N1 and R1 were not adjoining at the top, but nothing dramatic could be expected since this paper-stock has regular chain-widths and also tranchefiles spaced within 1 mm of 13 mm at both ends of the sheet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Besides trying to match portions of watermarks to determine what leaves were printed beside each other, we can also use the record of watermarks to establish that three sheets were required to print the 16 leaves with cancellantia and partial gatherings. In no copies does either the top or bottom half of the watermark appear more than three times in cancellantia and the partial gatherings. Thus, there is no watermark evidence that more than three sheets were needed to print these 16 leaves or that all leaves printed together on a sheet were not bound in the same copy. But that three sheets were needed to print these 16 leaves, as was shown by the presence on them of five leaves with tranchefiles within the TnU copy, is also evident from the appearance of three separate watermarks in the sixteen leaves within at least six copies: CSmH (complementary halves on B2 and B6, Cc1 and Cc2, and bottom half on R1), LdU-B (complementary halves on A 1, and U1 and bottom on B6 and N1), MiU (complementary halves on Cc1 and Cc2 and bottom on B6 and R6), O (complementary halves on B2 and B6 and also the bottom on R1 and U1), Owo (complementary halves on B2 and B6 and on Cc1 and Cc2 and bottom on N1), and PSt (complementary halves on Cc1 and Cc2 and bottom halves on B6 and N1). Furthermore, if we accept the evidence for placing on the same sheet the singletons and Cc 4 , or for placing on the same sheet N1.N2 and R1.R2, then other copies evince the need for three sheets. For instance, if either reconstructed unit is presupposed, three printed units are indicated by CoU, for it has the bottom of the watermark on AI and B6 and top on B2 and N1, and three printed units are indicated by L, for it has the bottom half on B6 and N1 and the top on Cc1.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Assuming that the sixteen leaves derive from three sheets and that partials cut from the same sheet were distributed to the same copy, the distribution of watermarks in these copies indicate what units were not printed with what other units (and by implication what units were printed with what others). Thus, watermarks described above for the CoU copy (bottom halves on A 1 and B6 and tops on B2 and N1) indicate that the B cancellantia was printed on separate sheets from A 1 and N1, and those described above for the O copy (complementary halves on B2 and B6 and also bottom halves on R1 and U1) indicate the singleton half-sheet, the B cancellantia half-sheet, and R1.R2 were printed on separate sheets. Watermark patterns rule out the possibility that the singletons could have been printed with any leaves other than Cc 4 (not the half-sheet with B2 nor N1.N2, for in LdU-B leaves A 1 and U1 as well as B2 and B6 have complementary halves and N1 has a watermark, and not R1.R2, for in Csj U1 and R1 have bottom halves). With evidence drawn from multiple copies, the same logic can show that the half-sheet with B2.B7+1 and B6.B7 could not have been printed with the singletons, N1.N2, R1.R2, or Cc 4 ; or that N1.N2 could have been printed with the singletons, the B cancels, or Cc 4 ; and so forth. Finally, the general watermark patterns show that leaves A 1 and U1 were printed with Cc 4 . When watermarks appear on leaves A 1 or U1, they also—in at least some copies—appear on B2, B6, N1, and R1, but none of 27 (possibly 28) copies with watermarks on A 1 and/or U1 also has them in Cc 4 . Furthermore, none of the 24 copies known to have a watermark in Cc 4 has a watermark in A 1 or U1. Yet copies with a watermark in Cc 4 fairly often also have a watermark in the canceled folds in B (as C CaOTU CSmH L MdBJ MiU NIC NjP NRU Occ OCU Ose Owo PSt TnU), in N1 (as ICN1 L May MH2 MiU MoU NIC NjP NRU Ose OTH Owo PSt TnU and possibly CaOTU), and in R1 (as CSmH, MdBJ, MH1 MiU Occ). These watermark patterns indicate that A 1 and U1, with their likely conjugates B3 and Dd1, formed a whole sheet with Cc 4 . This seems all the more certain because leaf Dd1 continues the postscript text on Cc4 v .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We know that B2.B7+1 and B6.B7 formed a half-sheet printed separately from the other cancels and partial gatherings in the edition. We might now ask whether this half-sheet of B cancellantia was imposed for work-and-turn and printed by itself or whether it occupied a sheet with four leaves of other text. Half-sheet imposition might have been preferable if the rest of the book had been printed, if cancellantia N1.N2 and R1.R2 were not yet composed, or if Richardson wished the B cancellantia solely to occupy a chase to facilitate Young's revision and correction. Then too half-sheets offered the simplicity of printing separately Young's text on the paper-stock billed to him. (Were a paper-stock different from the dominant “NH” stock found in the cancellans folds of B, we might suppose they were printed with other jobs.) Since only half the sheet is watermarked and roughly half the copies have a watermark in the B cancellantia half-sheet (26), we are unable to conclude whether it was produced through work-and-turn or with other material in whole sheets. If either considerably more than or fewer than half of the copies had watermarks on B2 or B6, then only full-sheet imposition could account for that pattern. We could suppose that half of the forme with the B cancellantia was regularly draped with the watermarked or the non- watermarked half of the sheet. It is certain that all the B cancellans folds for all copies were not printed off with the watermark end of the sheet, for uncut Csj and a number of large copies (FU, MR1, MR3, and TxU all 200 mm tall, MH2 at 201 mm, and O at 203) lack watermarks on B2 and B6. We can assume that the roughly one-half figure is representative and that it was never considerably above fifty-percent, for the singletons and Cc half-sheets yielded the comparable figures of 25 (or 26) and 24 respectively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In conclusion, the 16 leaves of cancellantia and partial gatherings to be accounted for were printed on three units: the singletons and Cc 4 on one whole sheet, folds N1.N2 and R1.R2 on another whole sheet (with unidentified material), and the cancellans folds B2.B7+1 and B6.B7 separately through either whole-sheet or half-sheet imposition. The pattern of watermark distributions supports this conclusion and argues that almost always the leaves printed together went into the same copy. We know that the cancellation of material on leaves R1-R2 occurred at the same time as that of N1-N2, days after Young's letter of 26 January 1755. Also after 26 January, leaf U1 was canceled, for cancellans U1 was printed with cancellans B3, and Young returned with approval the proofs for the revised B gathering only on 26 January, responding to Richardson's proposed changes penned 21 January 1755. The whole sheet with B3 and the half- or whole-sheet with the other B cancellantia must have been printed at nearly the same time since the texts on B3 had to begin and end in sequence with that on B2 v . Perhaps the printing of cancels N1.N2 was further delayed by changes, unrecorded in the correspondence, that appear on cancels R1-R2.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">These tables provide, for 42 copies (cited with abbreviations glossed in Appendix 2) the distance of the first chain-line from the spine at the top of disjunct and canceled leaves. Leaves in gathering B are numbered as they appear; when the first chain-line is too close to the fold to allow measurement, 26 or 27 has been subtracted from the second chain-line to place the first one.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">1 The first edition octavo, indexed in the ESTC as T113256, has the full title The Centaur Not Fabulous in Five Letters to a Friend, on the Life in Vogue and was printed for Andrew Millar and Robert and James Dodsley. The edition was first announced published in the London Evening Post of 1-4 March 1755 (bound, 5s.). In the same year, with “Five” altered to “Six” in the title, Millar and the Dodsleys published a revised second edition, also an octavo (15-17 April, LEP ), and a revised third edition, a duodecimo (17 November, Public Advertiser; 3s. bound). Additions to the text lengthened the second edition sufficiently that, although often a page-for-page reprinting, it is several leaves longer, collating 8°: (frt. +) A 2 B-Cc 8 . Peter Wilson and John Exshaw brought out a duodecimo edition in Dublin in 1755, called the “Third Edition,” evidently published before the London third edition. Young revised The Centaur once again for its reprinting in Volume 4 of his The Works of the Author of The Night Thoughts (1757). Millar and James Dodsley brought out a “fourth edition,” in duodecimo, in 1765. Thereafter, the work was not frequently reprinted except within collections of Young's works. Unlike the authorized editions of 1757, 1762, 1767, and 1774 where The Centaur is in Vol. 4 after Night 9 of The Complaint, unauthorized works editions usually place The Centaur in a volume intended to be sold separately. The Dublin publishers G. and A. Ewing and partners placed it alone in Vol. 4 of their four-volume Works (1764), which lacks any works title and begins with the title-page for The Centaur. The Centaur shares the fourth volume with three prose items not included in the authorized collections ( Conjectures on Original Composition, The Vindication of Providence, and the “Essay on Lyric Poetry” from Imperium Pelagi ) in the unauthorized Works in Prose of the Reverend Edward Young (London: P. Brown, H. Hill, and S. Payne, 1765), a separate issue of Vol. 4 of a four-volume works with this same false imprint. In 1770 these four prose pieces were reprinted as The Centaur Not Fabulous, and Other Prose Works of the Reverend Dr. Edward Young (Edinburgh: Martin and Wotherspoon, 1770), a separate issue of Vol. 4 of their four-volume works, also issued with a false imprint (London: S. Crowder, C. Ware, and T. Payne, 1770). These four prose works were reprinted in 1774 with a variant of the 1765 false imprint (London: P. Brown, H. Hill, and S. Bayne [sic]). A six-volume Works printed in 1774, issued with various imprints (one for J. Donaldson in London, and four others placed in Edinburgh: for Alex. Donaldson; for J. Dickson; for C. Elliott; and “by and for” Colin Macfarquhar), includes The Centaur in Volume V with two poems excluded from the authorized works. The first American edition of The Centaur, a duodecimo, was printed in Philadelphia by T. Stephens and W. W. Woodward in 1795. The Centaur was translated into German in 1755 ( Der nicht fabelhafte Centaur in sechs Briefen [Leipzig: J. G. Dyck, with a separate Frankfurt issue]) and into Dutch in 1768 ( De Centaurus geen Verdichtsel [Amsterdam: P. Meijer]). 2 Henry Pettit, ed., The Correspondence of Edward Young 1683-1765 (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1971), p. 404; hereafter cited as “Pettit.” For a judicious, comprehensive account of The Centaur 's composition and publication, see Harold Forster's Edward Young: The Poet of the Night Thoughts 1683-1765 (Alburgh, Harleston, Norfolk: Erskine Press, 1986), pp. 268 and 280-287. 3 Samuel Richardson: A Biography (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971), 432n. 4 That within the dedication the second edition shares the same essential page settings as the B cancellantia is evident from type alignment and damaged type throughout. Note, for instance, that the “g” cut at top in ldquo;Pegasean” (B6 v /xii.3) and the “d” cut in “untamed” (B6 v /xii.4) are also in the second edition on B5 v , and that the “a” cut at top in “scandalized” (B7 r /xiii.1) and the “a” cut in “Travels” (B7 + 1 v /xvi.2) are also in the second edition on B6 r and B7 v . The first- edition page settings end up as different pages of the second edition, for in the latter the dedication is begun on leaf A2 conjugate to the title-page. 5 The following pages of the first edition of The Centaur have press figures: B7 + 1 r / x v -7, C8 v /16-2, D8 r /31-5, F1 v /50-2, G1 v /66-4, H2 v /84-3, 16 r /107-3, K6 v /124-2, L5 r /137-3, M8 r /159-5, N3 v /166-2, O2 v /180-3, P1 v /194-3, Q2 v /212-1, R2 r /227-2, R6 v /236-3, S8 r /255-1, T3 v /262-4, T7 r /269-2, X6 v /300-1, Y7 v /318-1, Z6 r /331-1, Aa4 v /344-2, Aa7 v /350-7, Bb1 v /354-7, Cc3 r /373-1, and Cc3 v /374-4. In all copies seen, press figures appear on both the inner and outer formes of only gatherings T and Cc. Most but not all copies have two figures in gatherings R (although one is on cancellans R2) and Aa (this variation was missed by Eaves and Kimpel [432n.] and by William Todd [“Observations on the Incidence and Interpretation of Press Figures,” Studies in Bibliography, 3 (1950-51), 193]). Six copies lack the figure on R6 v (CSmH, FU, ICN1, MR3, NRU, and Oa), and only the top of the figure is visible in CaOTU, NcU, and OCU, suggesting it was accidentally lost. A third of the copies examined (18 of 58) lack the press figure on Aa7 v /350 and so have only one figure in Aa: C, CoU, Csj, CtY, LU, May, MH1, N, NeU, NIC, NjP, NRU, NSbSU, OAU, O-HF, PSt, MdBJ and Wns. Only gatherings E and U have no press figures in all copies, and U may have had a figure on the verso of the cancellandum of U1. 6 The preliminary, disjunct, cancellans, and concluding leaves of the uncut copy at St. John's College, Cambridge, have the following features (all measurements are in mm): Frontispiece (219 x 126): chain-lines 76-77/3 [i.e., 76-77 for 3 chain-widths]; tranchefile 11; no watermark. A 1 [t-p.] (213-215 x 137): chain-lines 81/3; tranchefile 13-14; 8-9 of the top of “NH” watermark (completing that on U1); glued to B1. B1. section title-page (212-215 tall): chain-lines, 101/4; no tranchefile or watermark; closest chain-line to the fold on B1: 17 (matching B4). B2 (212-213 x 135): conjugate to B7+1; chain-lines, 79-80/3; tranchefile 12 at top; 14 at bottom; no watermark; ragged top edge matching that on B6. B3 (212-213 x 132): chain-lines, 79-80/3; no tranchefile or watermark; uneven top edge matching that on Dd1; glued to leaf B2. B4.B5 (215 x 270): chain-lines, 101-103/4; no tranchefile or watermark; closest chain-lines to the fold: 19 on B4; 28-29 on B5; point hole at 165 down B5. B6 (212-215 x 134): conjugate to what appears to be B7; chain-lines, 80/3; tranchefile, 13- 14; no watermark; ragged top edge matching that on B2. B7 and B7+1 (215 x 133; 212 x 131): chain-lines, 80/3; no tranchefile or watermark; point hole on B7+1 114 down outer edge. N1.N2 (208-210 x 128, 131): chain-lines, 79/3; tranchefile on N1, 12-13; no watermark; point hole on N2 shared with R2 at 165-170 down outer edge; sewn in, with stubs behind N2. R1.R2 (210-213 x 124, 134-135): chain-lines, 78/3; tranchefile, 13; 9 mm of the bottom of the “NH” watermark (same half as U1); point hole on R2 shared with N2 at 165-170 down outer edge; sewn in, with stubs behind R2. U1 (212-213 x 137): chain-lines, 105-106/4; tranchefile, 12-13; 4.5 of bottom of “NH” watermark visible (same portion as on R1 and completing A 1's half); glued to stub behind it. Cc4 (213-214 x 133): chain-lines, 105/4; tranchefiles on Cc1 and Cc2, 12-13; no watermarks; parallel chains on Cc1, Cc2; point holes on Cc3 110 down and on Cc4 153 down on outer edge. Dd1 (215 x 132): chain-lines, 108/4; no tranchefile or watermark; uneven top edge matching that on B3; glued to leaf Cc4. 7 A New Introduction to Bibliography (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1972), p. 128. 8 By measuring the distance out for chain-lines on known conjugates in regular gatherings, one first determines how much space is usually swallowed up in the fold (often this adds 1 mm to the apparent width). For instance, if one finds that the distances to the first chain-lines out from the fold on leaves known to be conjugate add up to 22 mm when the usual chain-width is 26 mm, then one need allow more for the fold. If easy measurement from the fold is not possible, one can measure in from the outside edge to the closest chain-line to the fold and subtract that from the total width. One must remember that the trimmed leaves of a normal book will often vary progressively from beginning to middle to end by one or two millimeters, that rulers vary slightly in their measurements, and, that if the leaves are glued in several millimeters from the fold and the measurements begin just behind the fold, measurements could easily be off by 3-4 mm. For a good discussion of measuring chain-lines and other identifiable features of paper and a system for identifying paper moulds by these features, see David L. Vander Meulen's “The Identification of Paper without Watermarks: The Example of Pope's Dunciad, ” Studies in Bibliography, 37 (1984), 58-81. Vander Meulen's proposal that one reconstruct the chain-line model for the mould offers a surer but more time-consuming method than my reliance on the position of the first chain-line from the fold. 9 Watermarks are only seen in the leaf A 1 (not U1 also) in 9 copies: CaAEU, CoU, KU, MR3, NcU, Oa, O-HF, PRB, and ViWCF; and only seen in U1 in 7 or 8: CLU-C, ICN2, InU, N, O, Wns, WU, and possibly The Hague (where I think I identified one, but Librarian Paul van Capelleveen did not); and in the 11 copies wherein leaves A 1 and U1 share a watermark noted above in the text, for a total of 27 (possibly 28) of 58 copies seen. A watermark is shared by leaves B2 and B6 in 11 copies listed in the text and appears in either B2 or B6 in 15 others: C, CLU-C, L, LdU-B, MB, MiU, MnU, NeU, NIC, Oa, OCU, Ose, PSt, RPB, and WU, for a total of 26 of 58 copies seen. A watermark is shared by leaves Cc1 and Cc2 in 10 copies listed in the text and appears in either Cc1 or Cc2 in 14 copies: C, CaOHM, ICN1, IU, L, May, MdBJ, MoU, NIC, NjP, NNU, NRU, OCiU, and TnU, for a total of 24 copies seen. 10 For checking details in their libraries' copies, I thank the following: Paul van Capelleveen of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek, James Corsaro of the New York State Library, Geoffrey Day of Winchester College, Gail Greve of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation's John D.

      <field name="heading_text">BYRON, MEDWIN, AND THE FALSE FIEND: REMEMBERING “REMEMBER THEE” by Andrew M. Stauffer</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In October of 1824, soon after Byron's death, Thomas Medwin published his Journal of the Conversations of Lord Byron, noted during a residence with his Lordship at Pisa in the years 1821 and 1822 (London: Henry Colburn), a book that generated a great deal of excitement and commentary among its readers. 1 It went into three editions in England by the end of the year, and was immediately pirated in France, Germany, and America. 2 In addition to its obvious biographical significance, the Journal remains an important documentary source of a number of Byron's poems, including the brief lyric known as “Remember Thee” which is typically read as an emblem of his relationship with Caroline Lamb. 3 However, this poem and its publication history have been incompletely elucidated, and sorting these matters offers us an occasion for considering the ways that, with regard to Byron, memory depends upon the revision and bibliographic manipulation of texts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the Medwin volume appeared on October 23, 1824, details of Byron's sexual escapades were predictably at the center of public interest, and the volume offered some passages of carefully-edited titillation. Most notably, the first two English editions—as well as all of the piracies—depict Byron relating the story of his affair with Caroline Lamb (although her name is not mentioned). 4 Well-draped with asterisks, the narrative concludes with the story of the composition, as well as the text, of “Remember Thee.” Thus Medwin's first edition (with the lineation preserved): “Her after-conduct was unaccountable madness—a com- bination of spite and jealousy. It was perfectly agreed and understood that we were to meet as strangers. We were at a ball. She came up and asked me if she might waltz. I thought it perfectly indifferent whether she waltzed or not, or with whom, and told her so, in different terms, but with much coolness. After she had finished, a scene occurred, which was in the mouth of every one. “Soon after this she promised young—* if he would call me out. * * * * * * * * Yet can any one believe that she should be so infatuated, after all this, as to call at my apartments? (certainly with no view of shooting herself.) I was from home; but finding `Vathek' on the table, she wrote in the first page, `Remember me!' “Yes! I had cause to remember her; and, in the irritability of the moment, wrote under the two words these two stanzas:— `Remember thee, remember thee! Till Lethe quench life's burning stream, Remorse and shame shall cling to thee, And haunt thee like a feverish dream! Remember thee! Ay, doubt it not; Thy husband too shall think of thee; By neither shalt thou be forgot, Thou ***** to him, thou ***** to me!'” (213-215) The reception history of this passage amounts to efforts to replace its asterisks with revealing words. Indeed, the details of the “scene” that took place at Lady Heathcote's ball (where a distraught Caroline cut herself with a piece of glass) were already well known by many of Medwin's readers. 5 Thanks largely to the work of Ernest Lovell, we also know exactly what Byron claimed Caroline promised to whom (her “favors,” to Henry Grattan). 6 And although we also know what words belong in the last line of the poem, how we know them and when they appeared have been obscured.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It has not been recognized that, despite the fact that no manuscript is known, the extant documentary record of the poem known as “Remember Thee” begins even before the publication of Medwin's work. In early October of 1824, Byron's poem and the circumstances of its composition were printed in a new monthly magazine published in London, entitled The Attic Miscellany. 7 These neglected pre-publication extracts from the Journal of the Conversations are of crucial bibliographical significance, as they offer more complete versions of the poem and the Caroline Lamb anecdote. Following their appearance in the Miscellany, Medwin decided to delete some of the more offensive phrases from both texts. Indeed, all English editions of Medwin's book contain the text of “Remember Thee” with two sets of asterisks in the final line of the poem. The result has been a kind of wrinkle in the scholarly record, whereby the paths that lead to certain information have been improperly mapped. I mean to address this by bringing The Attic Miscellany and the many piracies of Medwin's Journal to light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To begin within our current critical horizon: a glance at Byron's Complete Poetical Works, edited by Jerome McGann, reveals that the asterisks in the final line of “Remember Thee” have been replaced by the words “false” and “fiend.” 8 In a note, McGann explains that “these two words [were] first supplied in C[oleridge's] alternate version” (CPW, 3:84). In this assumption, he follows Lovell, who also replaces the asterisks in his version of Medwin's text, and who notes that “false” and “fiend” were taken “from E. H. Coleridge's edition of Byron's Poetry ” ( Conversations, 219). Coleridge's Works of Lord Byron has been accepted, then, as our only authority for the “false... fiend” conclusion. After making the replacement in his text of the poem, Coleridge notes that “In Medwin's work the euphemisms false and fiend are represented by asterisks.” 9 Lovell and McGann assume that Coleridge has the justification for inserting these “euphemisms” because he had seen an alternate version of this lyric. As a footnote to the final line, Coleridge prints the following: [“To Bd., Feb. 22, 1813. “`Remember thee,' nay—doubt it not— Thy Husband too may ` think ' of thee! By neither canst thou be forgot, Thou false to him—thou fiend to me! “`Remember thee'? Yes—yes—till Fate In Lethe quench the guilty dream. Yet then—e'en then—Remorse and Hate Shall vainly quaff the vanquished stream.” From a MS. (in the possession of Mr. Hallam Murray) not in Byron's handwriting.] (C, 3:60) Coleridge seems to be the only editor to have seen this now-lost manuscript. On the strength of his report, modern editors have inserted “false” and “fiend” in the Medwin text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet for editors wishing to justify the “false... fiend” substitution, Coleridge is unnecessary as a source of information, given the premier and sole issue of the Attic Miscellany, published just before the first edition of Medwin's Journal of the Conversations of Lord Byron appeared. As Lovell reports, the Miscellany was “established by [Thomas Colley] Grattan, Henry Bulwer, and Charles Sheridan,” and it was Grattan who “was responsible for the excerpts which appeared” ( Captain Medwin, 170). This makes sense, since Grattan (who had met Medwin through Thomas Moore in 1821) acted as Medwin's agent for his Journal, striking a deal with publisher Henry Colburn for its publication. 10 As Grattan writes, the MS. in question [i.e., Medwin's Journal ] was put into our hands, with the amplest liberty of selection for our present purpose. Sensible of the advantage thus offered to us, we did not abuse the confidence.... Our chief object in taking enough to enrich our own work, was to give the public a specimen of the ample treat which they will so shortly be able to enjoy. ( Attic Miscellany, 29) The editors of the Miscellany must have been working from Medwin's original manuscript, since, in printing the account of the Caroline Lamb relationship and the text of “Remember Thee,” they provide several phrases and sentences that were not included in the book, including the words in the final line of the poem. 11 In the following passage, the words unique to the Miscellany are printed with emphasis:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I thought it perfectly indifferent whether she waltzed or not, or with whom, and I told her so, in different terms, but with much coolness. After she had finished, a comi-tragic scene occurred which was in the mouth of every one. She stabbed herself with a pair of scissars, and cut herself with a tumbler. Soon after this she promised young —.... if he would call me out. I suppose he did not think her worth fighting for. Yet can any one believe that she should be so infatuated after all this as to call my apartments—certainly with no view of shooting herself. I was from home, but finding `Vathek' on the table, she wrote in the first page `Remember me!'—Yes, I had cause to remember her, and in the irritability of the moment wrote, under the two words, these two stanzas:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Remember thee—remember thee! Till Lethe quench life's burning stream; Remorse and shame shall cling to thee, And haunt thee like a feverish dream. Remember thee!—aye, doubt it not— Thy husband too shall think of thee: By neither shalt thou be forgot— Thou false to him—thou fiend to me! (37)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The tale and poem were never again published this completely. Another London magazine, The Literary Gazette and Journal of the Belles Lettres, Arts, Science, &amp;c., reviewed the Attic Miscellany in its issue for Saturday, October 16, 1824. In its predictable focus on the Medwin-Byron material, its editors reprint “Remember Thee,” but their version cuts even more than Medwin's first edition does, replacing with asterisks not only the “false” and “fiend,” but the “husband” in line six as well. 12 However, these words were already in public circulation, as demonstrated in the many piracies of Medwin's Journal of the Conversations that appeared within weeks of the first English edition. Versions published in the United States, France, and Germany all insert “false” and “fiend” in the final line of “Remember Thee.” 13</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In fact, the one person in England whom Medwin surely hoped would not see the “false... fiend” conclusion did see it, and it made a lasting impression. In a letter ostensibly to Medwin, but sent to Henry Colburn for publication soon after the Journal of the Conversations appeared, Caroline Lamb wrote, I have just finished your book which does you credit... and... will live despight of censure.... Yet as you have left to one who adored him a bitter legacy, and as I feel secure the lines “ remember thee-thou false to him thou fiend to me ”—were his... you will I'm sure grant me one favour—let me to you at least confide the truth of the past. (LJ, 2:451; my emphasis) 14 Later in life, she wrote to Lady Morgan that Byron “left that dreadful legacy on me—my memory. Remember thee—and well.” 15 Byron's poem seems to have had its intended effect, reversing Caroline's abjuration to remember her with its own angry inscription in her memory. Further, as a part of Medwin's best-selling volume, the poem inscribes itself on the public record as a condemnation of Caroline. Her recognition that Medwin's book would “live despight of censure” and her repeated emphasis on the poem as a “bitter legacy” and a “dreadful legacy” show her well aware of the memorializing power of Byron's words.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In telling the story of the composition of “Remember Thee,” Byron remembers Caroline Lamb for posterity, and offers the poem as his final word on their relationship. Furthermore, the poem enacts its curse of “shame” and remembrance by means of its transmission via Medwin. To be sure, as presented in all official editions of the Journal, the definitive words of the poem's final line disappear beneath series of asterisks. Yet, like the scene at Lady Heathcote's which “was in the mouth of everyone” but which Medwin represents with asterisks, the “false... fiend” conclusion seems to have been known virtually everywhere except within the Medwin editions published in England. Contra Lovell and McGann, we need not rely on Coleridge's alternate version for these words, for they are also available in the Attic Miscellany extracts, as well as in the many piracies and in Caroline Lamb's letter. The world did not have to wait for Coleridge's twentieth-century edition (1898-1904) to discover that Byron thought Caroline a “false... fiend.” The Victorian reputations of Byron and Caroline included that crucial summary of their relationship.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">However, Caroline is far from the only “false... fiend” in Byron's body of work. The final line of “Remember Thee” has a certain resonance, given that the poet often refers to beautiful betrayers as false and fiendish. McGann has elucidated the “ figura of the repeated deceiver” that haunts Byron's poetry; typically female, she “is a fiend of equivocations, a woman— the woman—who knows how to lie like truth.” 16 In September of 1812, for example, Byron wrote another poem to Caroline Lamb in which he predicted she would “Be false unto many as faithless to one ” (CPW, 3:17) 17 —a predic- tion well on its way towards the “false... fiend” line of “Remember Thee.” Furthermore, in Manfred (1817) and Cain (1821), Byron uses the words “false” and “fiend” together, in both cases as a character's response to the deceptive temptations of beauty. In the final act of Manfred, Manfred defies the Spirit sent to convey his soul to hell, and the Spirit exclaims, “Reluctant mortall / ... Can it be that thou / Art thus in love with life? the very life / Which made thee wretched!” (CPW, 4:101). Manfred responds, “Thou false fiend, thou liest!” Obviously the Spirit has touched a nerve. Manfred's anger at the suggestion that he loves life seems related to the opening moments of this scene, in which Manfred gazes out at the moonlit mountains and thinks, “Beautiful!” (CPW, 4:97). Knowing that the death he has sought is at hand, he lingers over this tableau of beauty, which causes him to remember another similar night in Rome when the moonlight left “that beautiful which still was so,” and made beautiful “that which was not, till the place / Became religion, and the heart ran o'er / With silent worship” (CPW, 4:98). In reminding Manfred of these temptations that offer to weaken his resolve, the Spirit provokes Manfred's wrath. Similarly, in Cain, Adah exclaims to Lucifer, “Fiend! tempt me not with beauty; thou art fairer / Than was the serpent, and as false” (CPW, 6:245-246). Lucifer has been simultaneously arguing and flirting with Adah, enticing her towards one kind of capitulation or another; and Adah responds with the “false... fiend” spell of resistance as a defense against the encroachment of this beautiful devil. Caroline's invasion of Byron's apartments and her haunting injunction “Remember me!” inspires the same response from Byron: an apotropaic defiance of beautiful deceptions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Like Manfred who asks only for “Forgetfulness” (CPW, 4:57) of his relationship with Astarte, Byron in “Remember Thee” wants “Lethe” to “quench” his tormenting memories of a woman. The poem thus enacts a wicked trope on the traditional lyric of parted love in which the lover mourns for days that are no more. In Byron's own early lyrics such as “To a Beautiful Quaker” (1806) and “[Remind me not, remind me not]” (1808), the speaker suffers from a painful inability to forget his mistress—painful, because she is out of reach. As Byron writes in “[Remind me not],” “tell me not, remind me not / Of hours which, though for ever gone, / Can still a pleasing dream restore” (CPW, 1:218). Such emotions are precisely opposite those of “Remember Thee,” in which the mistress is unforgettable because all-too-present, and the memories themselves comprise a “guilty dream” rather than a pleasing one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On April 5, 1813, Byron wrote to Lady Melbourne about his feelings for Caroline: the detestation—the utter abhorrence I feel at part of her conduct—I will neither shock you with nor trust myself to express.—That feeling has become a part of my nature—it has poisoned my future existence—I know not whom I may love but to the latest hour of my life I shall hate that woman.—Now you know my sentiments—they will be the same on my deathbed.——To her I do not express this because I have no desire to make her uncomfortable—but such is the state of my mind towards her for reasons I shall not recur to &amp; I beg to be spared from meeting her until we may be chained together in Dante's Inferno. (BLJ, 3:35-36) Byron's invocation of Dante here casts himself as a bitter Paolo to Caroline's Francesca, and places them both in Hell's Second Circle, abode of those who surrendered to adulterous lust. In his redaction of this scene from the Inferno, Byron imagines the couple “chained together” in “hate,” rather than clinging to one another out of love. A similar vision governs “Remember Thee,” which reenacts the traditional forget-me-not love lyric as a declaration of infernal hatred: Caroline has been “false” to her husband, and has become a tormenting “fiend” to Byron. As Maurois remarks of the poem, “Nothing was more in character for Byron than this linking of husband with lover in the case against a woman whose worst crime had been the unpardonable sin of loving him.” 18</field>
      <field name="fulltext">However, the textual situation complicates our reading of this poem, even if we assume the “false... fiend” question settled. The two versions that we have—Medwin's and E. H. Coleridge's “To Bd.” text—offer different responses to Caroline and her inscription. To be sure, the “false... fiend” stanza of the poem is similar enough in both versions to establish the general sense of the poem: Byron would like to forget Caroline and his affair with her, but cannot. The poem's other stanza elaborates this idea in the “To Bd.” version, in which Byron claims that only Lethe can “quench the guilty dream” and even then his “Remorse and Hate ” will remain. Here the guilt, remorse, and hatred all belong to Byron: they are the unforgettable emotions raised in him by thoughts of Caroline. On the other hand, in the Medwin version of the poem, these emotions are ascribed to the poem's addressee: “Remorse and shame shall cling to thee, / And haunt thee like a feverish dream!” These lines seem a bit of a non sequitur after the exasperated exclamation of disbelief, “Remember Thee,” and thus mark the poem as the product of a later scene of revision.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus Medwin's version of the poem raises two possibilities regarding its composition: either Byron adapted the original lines in order to place a more particular and cutting message to Caroline before the public eye or Medwin's own forgetfulness caused him to render the poem inaccurately. On the one hand, we should recall that, despite their linguistic similarities, the poems emerge out of radically different circumstances to perform radically different tasks. The Vathek text was written sometime in 1813 or 1814 as a private inscription, an angry reaction to Caroline's intrusion, and a record of Byron's essentially incommunicable frustration. The Medwin text, on the other hand, was composed in 1821 or 1822 as Byron reordered his life for Medwin. By then Caroline really was a memory, and much had intervened to deepen Byron's antipathy towards her, notably Glenarvon and the rumors that Caroline had spread about his relationship with Augusta Leigh. As a disapproving E. C. Mayne puts it in her introduction to the story of Byron's “Remember Thee”: Let us read... what he said to Medwin in 1821-22—remembering, that justice may be done, all that had happened in the meantime to embitter him against her: Glenarvon, and the rumours to which she too had probably contributed. 19 Byron suspected, apparently correctly, that Caroline had been spreading rumours about his incestuous relationship with Augusta Leigh. 20 Essentially, she had gone public with her loving hatred for Byron. To Medwin Byron gave a poem meant as a communication to Caroline and the world, a curse of memory that would wickedly reverse her injunction, “Remember me!” Thus the Vathek test—missing, longed for, and perhaps never seen—presents the sentimental poem as a spontaneous overflow of powerful outrage, whereas the Medwin text is a calculated deployment of vengeful feelings served cold by way of an eager (although perhaps forgetful) Thomas Medwin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This textual situation is notably Byronic, in that it involves a cunning takeover of one poem by another for particular and personal communicative ends. For example, McGann has shown that the Incantation in Manfred began as a “chorus in a witch drama” and was meant as a curse on his wife and their tormenting marriage (CPW, 7:90-92, 155). As in the case with “Remember Thee,” a poem that began as a private expression of hatred finds another incarnation as part of a more public document where it can perform its curse, more or less obliquely, before its readers' eyes. In fact, the Medwin “Remember Thee” invokes the same language and spirit as the Incantation, confirming Byron's sense of purpose for these published curses. When in the Medwin version, he follows his expression of disbelief, “Remember Thee,” with prophetic statements regarding Caroline's own memory, he demonstrates this desire to wrench the poem from lament to curse: “Remorse and shame shall cling to thee / And haunt thee like a feverish dream!” His own “Remorse,” “Hate,” and “guilty dreams” have been replaced in this gesture of emotional mastery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the other hand, one could make a case that the Medwin version simply became garbled in its journey into print. Due in part to the belated and apparently oral circumstances of its transmission, and in part to Medwin's notoriously bad memory, the poem arguably shows signs of being a confused mingling of Shelley and Byron. Later in his book, Medwin quotes Byron as saying, “Then as to Keats, though I am no admirer of his poetry, I do not envy the man, whoever he was, that attacked and killed him. Except a couplet of Dryden's On his own bed of torture let him lie, Fit garbage for the hell-hound infamy, I know no lines more cutting than those in `Adonais.'” (Lovell, Conversations, 237) 21 Medwin then misquotes the Shelley passage from memory: Remorse and Self-contempt shall cling to thee; Hot Shame shall burn upon thy Cain-like brow, And like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt as now (Lovell, Conversations, 237) Both this passage and Medwin's first stanza of “Remember Thee” ascribe “remorse” and “shame” to their enemies, emotions that will “cling” and induce symptoms of fever. Also relevant is Prometheus' curse of Jupiter in Shelley's Prometheus Unbound, which Medwin may have been remembering: Fiend, I defy thee!... I curse thee! Let a sufferer's curse Clasp thee, his torturer, like remorse, Till thine Infinity shall be A robe of envenomed agony; And thine Omnipotence a crown of pain To cling like burning gold round thy dissolving brain. 22 Again, “Remorse” will “Clasp” or “cling” with a “burning” or fever. The similarities are striking and suggest that the first stanza of Medwin's “Remember Thee” is an amalgam of angry Shelley and angry Byron. So it is possible that the Medwin text has been adulterated by inaccurate powers of recall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Particularly in light of these observations, E. H. Coleridge's record of the variant text “To Bd.” should cause us to reconsider our sense of this poem as such. Intimately related to a specific biographical event, “Remember Thee” is occasional verse with a vengeance. Thus its original manuscript version—the lines actually penned by Byron beneath Caroline's inscription—has a priority that later versions cannot disturb. Despite the greater currency of the Medwin version, we cannot be satisfied with it as our only standard text of Byron's poem. Given that both versions have no direct authority, Coleridge's at least has claims to chronological proximity and transcriptive accuracy that Medwin's does not. The “To Bd.” text is dated “Feb. 22, 1813”— certainly much nearer to the date of the lyric's original composition than Medwin's reconstruction in the 1820s. In other words, if we accept the date at the head of this manuscript as accurate, as McGann has done, we cannot relegate Coleridge's footnote (that is, the “To Bd.” text) to our own margins. 23 After all, the Medwin text is a printed version of a transcript of a remembered conversation that took place at least seven years after the poem's composition. On the other hand, the “To Bd.” manuscript, if we accept it as Byron's own work, seems to have been copied (by someone) around the time of the alleged incident, and then printed by Coleridge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The “To Bd.” text does read more like an unconsidered outburst of rage, with its many dashes and repetitions. That Coleridge was the only person to see it matters little in this case, since his authority is certainly as good as Medwin's. However, several important objections to the “To Bd.” version as the official one do exist. First, the address of the poem “To Bd.” undermines its status as a response to Caroline Lamb. In addition, the date of the “To Bd.” manuscript raises questions about the chronology of the poem's composition. Acocrding to Medwin, Byron made it clear that Caroline's intrusion occurred after the scene at Lady Heathcote's “Small Waltzing Party”, which took place on July 5, 1813 (BLJ, 3:72). 24 If we accept Byron's story, we should place the composition of “Remember Thee” in June of 1814, 25 most likely just prior to Byron's writing this letter to Lady Melbourne: You talked to me—about keeping her [Caroline] out—it is impossible—she comes at all times—at any time—&amp; the moment the door is open in she walks—... I have no hesitation in saying—that I have made up my mind as to the alternative—and would sooner—much sooner be with the dead in purgatory—than with her— Caroline (I put down the name at length as I am not jesting) upon earth.—She may hunt me down —it is in the power of any mad or bad woman to do so by any man—but snare me she shall not—torment me she may—how am I to bar myself from her!—I am already almost a prisoner—she has no shame—no feeling—no one estimable or redeemable quality.—These are strong words—but I know what I am writing—... if there is one human being whom I do utterly detest &amp; abhor —it is she—&amp; all things considered—I feel to myself justified in so doing—she has been an adder in my path ever since my return to this country—she has often belied—&amp; sometimes betrayed me—she has crossed me every where—she has watched—&amp; worried &amp; guessed —&amp; been a curse to me and mine.—You may shew her this if you please—or to anyone you please—if these were the last words I were to write upon earth—I would not revoke one letter—except to make it more legible. —(BLJ, 4:132-133) The anger of this letter matches the tone of “Remember Thee” precisely; both documents show Byron enraged at Caroline's violation of his territory. If one compares this letter to those Byron was writing to Lady Melbourne about Caroline in January and February of 1813 (the date in the “To Bd” MS.), one finds Byron only mildly and good-humoredly annoyed by Caroline's importunities. 26</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several possible explanations exist for the date on the “To Bd.” manuscript. Coleridge could have misread the date, which may have been “1815.” Another possibility is that the poem was retrospectively dated when copied, and the unknown scribe was misinformed: the poem may have been copied from the page of Vathek, which itself had been previously inscribed with the 1813, perhaps a date of purchase (could the “Bd.” of this copy could be an abbreviation for “Beckford,” author of Vathek ? Or perhaps Bob Dallas, Byron's friend during this period?). In addition, this version of the poem could have been composed in 1813, in response to an entirely different event: Byron may have invented the Vathek anecdote (although Caroline doesn't deny the incident in her various comments on the poem), or, if Caroline did intrude in 1814, Byron may have remembered the poem and rewritten it (perhaps in altered form) on the page of Vathek.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In any case, the Medwin standard version of “Remember Thee” has occluded the double nature of this poem, and its conflicted first stanza indicates some kind of revisionary violence visited upon the original. We may choose to read this version, but should acknowledge its belated composition as a separate artistic act, perhaps influenced by Medwin's faulty memory. If we turn instead to the “To Bd.” version presented by E. H. Coleridge, we may be rewarded with a poem that is closer to Byron's lost holograph manuscript. To be sure, we want to conserve Medwin's text accurately as a document that contributed heavily to the Victorian memory of Byron and Caroline Lamb, and that attests to Byron's cunning manipulation of his own work. But as editors of Byron's poetry, we also want to come as close as possible to reconstructing the page of Vathek that was the stage of this angry little drama. It is important to keep these projects separate as we consider how to remember “Remember Thee.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1 For a summary of the circumstances surrounding the composition and publication of this volume, see Ernest J. Lovell's Captain Medwin: Friend of Byron and Shelley (Austin: U of Texas P, 1962), especially chapters 5 and 6. Also informative is Lovell's edition of Medwin's text, Conversations of Lord Byron (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1966), which is based on the third English edition and incorporates Medwin's annotations for a further edition that was never published. However, Lovell's accounts obscure the fact that the first edition was entitled Journal of the Conversations of Lord Byron; later English editions dropped ” Journal of the ” from their titles. Almost all editions published outside of England take their texts from the first edition, and thus also go under the “ Journal ” title. Except in the bibliography of Captain Medwin (333), Lovell refers to Medwin's volume uniformly as Conversations of Lord Byron. 2 Lovell calls the publication of the Conversations “one of the greatest storms in English literary history,” and estimates that fifteen editions appeared before it was all over, in a variety of languages ( Captain Medwin, 163, 171- 172). 3 Except in wholly biographical contexts (like Medwin's), the poem “Remember Thee” has been little noticed. For a rare critical reading, see pp. 42ff. of James Soderholm, “Lady Caroline Lamb: Byron's Miniature Writ Large,” Keats-Shelley Journal 40 (1991), 24-46. 4 This account was excised from the third edition, and Medwin never planned to restore it. See Lovell, ed., Conversations, 219. 5 See Leslie Marchand, Byron: A Biography, 3 vols. (New York: Knopf, 1957), 1:396-398; and Byron's Letters and Journals, ed. Leslie Marchand, 11 vols.

Other accounts appear in Lovell's His Very Self and Voice: Collected Conversations of Lord Byron (New York: Macmillan, 1954), 69-70. 617n57. 6 See Lovell, ed., Conversations, 218; and note 11 below. 7 Lovell notes the existence of these extracts in his Captain Medwin (170), but he apparently did not consult them. 8 Byron: The Complete Poetical Works, 7 vols. (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1980-93), 3:84. Hereafter CPW. 9 The Works of Lord Byron: Poetry, 7 vols. (London: J. Murray, 1898-1904), 3:59. Hereafter C. 10 For more on this transaction and the Miscellany, see T. C. Grattan's Beaten Paths; and Those Who Trod Them, 2 vols. (London: Chapman and Hall, 1865), 2:62ff. As Grattan writes, “I put Colburn in communication with Mr. Forbes, the editor of `The Attic Miscellany' and entrusted [him] with the care of its publication, leaving to that gentleman, on his being furnished with the proof-sheets, the choice of the passages from Medwin, and undertaking myself to write the article which was to introduce them” (2:63). 11 Interestingly enough, the one passage the Miscellany omits here involves a relative of Thomas Colley Grattan's: Byron reported to Medwin that Caroline promised “young Grattan her favours” if he would call Byron out (Lovell, ed., Conversations, 218). The reticence of the Miscellany editors here is surely based in part on the familial interests of their patron. 12 In the following Saturday's issue (Oct. 23), The Literary Gazette returned to the Caroline Lamb story as presented in Medwin, writing of Byron's “attack upon a woman, and one who had `loved not wisely but too well,' to which we also alluded in our last, and which being now openly circulated, it is needless in us any longer to disguise” (673). This issue reprints the Caroline anecdotes, but omits the two revealing sentences unique to the Attic Miscellany. However, the word “comi-tragic” does appear, indicating the Gazette relied in part on the Miscellany text. 13 New York: Wilder &amp; Campbell (1824), 153; Baltimore: Etting Mickle (1825), 163; Paris: Baudry, 1st edition (1824), 2:69; Gesprache mit Lord Byron, Stuttgart (1824), 251; Conservations de Lord Byron ..., (Paris: Chez Pillet Ainé, 1825), 2:86; and Les Conversations de Lord Byron, Recueillies par M. Medwin ... Par. M.A.P. [i.e., Amédée Pichot] Paris: Ladvocat (1824), 2:67 (this last edition comprises volumes 18 and 19 of Byron's Oeuvres nouvelles, edited by Pichot). Of all the foreign editions I have seen, only Galignani in Paris (1824) reprints Medwin's asterisks instead of “false” and “fiend.” None reprints the other prose phrases unique to the Attic Miscellany. Furthermore, Medwin's “Remember Thee” is printed with the words “false” and “fiend” in their places in several early collections of Byron's poetry: Miscellanies by Lord Byron, 3 vols. (London: John Murray, 1837), 3:93; and The Poetical Works of Lord Byron, “A New Edition,” 6 vols. (London: John Murray, 1855), 2:339. Both of these volumes offer a quotation from Medwin by way of explanation. 14 Caroline was greatly upset by Medwin's book and sent this letter to Colburn as a rejoinder. Habhouse wrote on Nov. 1, 1824, that Caroline was “in the utmost rage at Medwin's conversations representing her as not having been the object of Byron's attachment.” For this passage, and more on Caroline's letter, see Doris Langley Moore, The Late Lord Byron: Posthumous Dramas (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1961), 105-106. 15 Lady (Sydney) Morgan, Lady Morgan's Memoirs: Autobiography, Diaries, and Correspondence, 2 vols. (1862; New York: AMS, 1975), 2:207. 16 “`My Brain is Feminine': Byron and the Poetry of Deception,” Byron: Augustan and Romantic, ed. Andrew Rutherford (London: Macmillan, 1990), 35, 37. 17 He would reuse this phrase in “When We Two Parted” (a poem addressed to Lady Francis Webster) in 1815 (CPW, 2:320). McGann has discussed these poems in several places, notably “Byron and `The Truth in Masquerade,'” Romantic Revisions, ed. Robert Brinkley and Keith Hanley (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1992), 191-209; and “The Significance of Biographical Context: Two Poems by Lord Byron,” The Writer and His Work, ed. Louis A. Martz (New Haven: Yale UP, 1978), 347-364. 18 Andre Maurois, Byron, trans. Hamish Miles (New York: Appleton, 1930), 212. 19 Ethel Colburn Mayne, Byron, 2 vols. (New York: Scribner's, 1912), 1:252. 20 On this episode in their relationship, see Marchand, Byron: A Biography, 2:585-596. 21 Lovell notes that he cannot find these lines in Dryden ( Conversations, 237). This is because they originated with William Mason, in his An Heroic Postscript to the Public (London, 1774). Medwin misquotes the lines, however, as well as misattributing them—another example of memory gone wrong in the Journals. The actual lines are, “Stretch you on satire's rack, and bid you lie / Fit garbage for the hell-hound, Infamy” (lines 109-110). Byron may have seen a version of the couplet printed in The Satirist, October 1, 1809, in an article on a radical newspaper called The British Press: “But when I find it preaching sedition... it then becomes the duty of every honest man to... expose it to the world.... `Here on the rack of satire let it lie, / Fit garbage for the hell-hound Infamy.'” (5:335). He also almost certainly encountered an allusion to the lines in a review of his own poetry in The Scourge for March 1, 1811: “he has... indulged in accusations which the magnanamity of the injured individual alone withholds him from... punishing with a severity of torture that would leave him exhausted and unpitied on the rack of infamy” (1:193). 22 1.262, 286-291, in Shelley's Poetry and Prose, ed. Donald Reiman and Sharon Powers (New York: Norton, 1977), 143-144. 23 According to McGann, “Marchand dates the lines June 1814, but this is probably not correct, as the dating on the alternate version of the poem shows.... The poem has to do with an incident involving Lady Caroline Lamb in late Jan. or Feb. 1813” (CPW, 3:424). 24 See also Lord Byron: The Complete Miscellaneous Prose, ed. Andrew Nicholson (Oxford: Clarendon, 1991), 211. 25 In this judgement, I follow Marchand ( Byron: A Biography, 1:459) rather than McGann (see note 23). 26 In early January of 1813, Caroline managed to con Murray out of a picture of Byron; but Byron's response is mostly that of good-humored exasperation (BLJ, 3:12). This was still relatively early in their extended breaking-up. At the end of January, he wrote to Lady Melbourne, saying “I see nothing but the prospect of an endless correspondence in answering Ly. C.'s letters” (Jan. 22, 1813), indicating a sense of physical distance from her, unlike the furious paranoia of the June 1814 letter. On February 28, 1813, he was still speaking of the “charms of the fair Phryne”—rather than the “false... fiend” of 1814. See BLJ, 3:16, 23.</field>
