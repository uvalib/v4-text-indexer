THOMAS TANSELLE Textual criticism—the study of the relationships among variant texts of works—has primarily been associated, throughout its long history extending back to antiquity, with verbal works as transmitted on tangible objects such as parchment and paper. But all works, whether constructed of words or not, have had histories that—if fully told—would reveal stages of growth and change, reflecting not only their creators' intentions but also the ef- fects of their passage to the public and through time. All works, in other words, have textual histories. Whether or not one chooses in every case to use the word "text" to refer to the arrangement of elements that make up a work is irrelevant; the point is that the issues and problems dealt with in the textual criticism of verbal works have their counterparts in the study of all other works. One reason that this point has not been as widely acknowledged as it ought to have been is perhaps the fact that the varying media used in different arts affect the nature of the accompanying scholarship. The textual criticism of verbal works, for example, often leads to the produc- tion of scholarly editions, which embody insights derived from the study of textual history. Because the medium of verbal works—language—is fundamentally intangible, a work can be represented by a text in a newly produced physical object (the one conveying the scholarly edition) with- out making any alterations to the historic artifacts that had transmitted earlier texts of the work to the present. But a work in a tangible medium, like a painting or a sculpture, cannot as freely be accorded scholarly edi- tions, since any alteration deemed appropriate by the editor would per- manently alter the artifact that uniquely is the site of the intended work and thus would deprive the future of some of the evidence that had been available to the editor. Regardless of whether textual scholarship leads to editions or to es- says, the medium employed in each art determines the nature of the evidence available for reconstructing textual history. (I am not speaking of the quantity of evidence, which can vary irrespective of the medium.) The evolution of the text of a painting, for example, may be attested to by sketches, which are analogous in some respects to the drafts of a verbal work. But, being made of a physical material that is applied to a physi- cal surface, a painting may preserve earlier stages of its text that exist on the same surface beneath the layer of paint that is now on top, and these stages can be revealed, in varying degrees, by modern technology. Some works in intangible media, such as literature and music, can be transmit- ted either by direct imitation or by tangible aides-memoirs . When a textual tradition is entirely of the intangible kind, knowledge of a work's history is dependent on memory; when texts are passed along in physical objects, there is direct access to certain moments of the past (the moments when the documents were prepared), but the texts thus reported are not neces- sarily more trustworthy than those carried forward in human memory. The objects, however, inevitably carry traces of their own manufacture; and when those clues are uncovered through analysis, they can help ex- plain how the text came to be constituted as it is. This procedure is the counterpart to scrutinizing a canvas for underlying layers of paint: the examination of objects can be as crucial to reconstructing textual histories of works in intangible media as it is for those in tangible media. Textual critics must of course assess whatever evidence is available to them, but the process must take into account the fact that some evidence may be transmitted by media different from the medium of the work itself. Furthermore, the textual history of a work proceeds beyond the point at which the creator or creators of the work die or cease to make changes in it. The discipline of textual criticism has traditionally focused on the evolution of texts only up to that point, though the evidence often has to come, by default, from later documents. But the alterations that texts undergo as they are disseminated to the public, both during and after their creators' lifetimes, are part of the full story of the life of any work (as textual critics have increasingly come to recognize). Such alterations take different forms for works in different media. Since works in tangible media exist in their originally created form only at the geographical loca- tions where they are placed at any given time, they are often reproduced in order to allow people to experience them, at least to some extent, without traveling to those locations. Such reproductions cannot dupli- cate precisely the physical material of the original, and they frequently use different media, as when an oil painting on canvas is reproduced by a photographic process on paper (inevitably with differences in coloring and perhaps with different dimensions as well). Many more people may be familiar with an image in its reproduced forms than have ever seen it in the original, and those textually different forms are therefore relevant to the historical study of a work's reputation and influence. In the case of verbal works transmitted on paper, their physical forms were not, in the large majority of instances, regarded by their creators as parts of the works. But because the physical features of books reflect contemporary culture and frequently have an effect on readers, those features become textual elements for the study of cultural change and reception history. None of these points is surprising: they follow naturally from the rec- ognition that some works (such as paintings, sculptures, and buildings) are basically made of tangible materials and that others (such as literature, music, dance, and film) are basically intangible in nature. In practice, works may consist of mixed media—not merely in the sense that differ- ent ingredients associated with a single art form are brought together (as when watercolor and crayon are used in the same work) but, more significantly, in the sense that elements of different arts (including those with a different ontological status) are made parts of a single work (as when words and music, or words and visual effects, are joined). The tex- tual study of any work, mixed or not, can proceed more thoughtfully and logically if it is conducted with an awareness of the relationships among the media employed by all arts and the conditions set by each medium in regard to textual change. In what follows, I shall look at a variety of arts and comment on some of the similarities and distinctions among them from the point of view of textual criticism. Although I outlined these considerations in A Rationale of Textual Criticism (1989), I wish now to expand the discussion in the hope of clarifying some of the issues that are often raised, sometimes confus- ingly, in popular discourse on the arts. (My examples come from the New York Times , to which all parenthetical dates below refer.) I hope that these comments, which are intended to be no more than suggestive, can begin to show how a framework might be formed for thinking about the textual histories of human creations in all media. Work in Intangible Media 1. Verbal Work Works constructed of verbal languages are a useful starting point be- cause they have been so extensively discussed in the literature of textual criticism that for many people they constitute a natural frame of refer- ence for textual questions in general. Yet (or perhaps not surprisingly) the medium of language is the most mysterious of all media. It would not be so if it were unquestionably oral, with tangible texts being only the re- cords (like musical scores) by which the vocal work is recreated. Not only is it possible, however, to have languages without oral components but also—and more importantly for present purposes—it is common for au- thors to expect their works to be read silently, without the spoken sounds of the words being formed imaginatively in the mind. Of course, some writers (and not only poets) do wish the sounds to be heard internally; but even in those cases, or most of them, the authors feel that the works have been experienced in their intended medium whether read silently or aloud. Whatever may be said about the origins of language, in practice it is a medium that can exist apart from speech. But its written presentation on a physical surface is not its primary form either: most writings, from the point of view of their creators, are not visual works, for the works still exist when presented in different handwriting or typefaces on different papers. However difficult it is to define the medium of language, one thing is therefore clear: the medium is intangible. Like all works in intangible media, verbal works require performance of some kind (oral or internal) for their realization; and because performances have duration, such works consist of sequential texts, intended by their creators to be experienced from a beginning to an end. One of the problems that these conditions pose for textual criticism is the likelihood of confusing the work with its means of transmission. When verbal works are communicated on paper, readers (and even, at times, the class of readers called textual critics) may think of the works as what they see rather than as what they silently perform. They may automati- cally correct a typographical error, for example, without realizing that other places in the text may also be erroneous (from the point of view of the author's or the publisher's intention). What textual critics and other readers have available to them in documentary texts are various attempts, from various past moments, to provide instructions for recreating a work. The fact that words and punctuation on paper are perceived by the eye does not in itself make the text a work of visual art, for the artistry of the physical design is not normally a part of the intended verbal work. (Punc- tuation is no more visual from this point of view than the words; it, like them, is an element of linguistic meaning, transferrable into pauses and intonations in recited texts.) Authors do at times, however, choose to use visual effects, creating mixed-media works that employ both a tangible medium (since the pictorial images and spatial arrangements exist in ink on paper) and an intangible one (language). The relative proportions of each medium can vary: at one end, for example, are primarily verbal works in which some of the text is shaped (like George Herbert's bird- wings and Lewis Carroll's mouse-tail, or indeed stanza indentations and spacing), and at the other are primarily visual works in which language is simply a significant element (like concrete poetry). Textual criticism, which elucidates these conditions, controls the op- tions for editors: in the first of these situations, new editions (with critical, reset texts) are possible so long as the shaping is maintained; in the sec- ond, where the work is totally dependent on physical presentation, only a facsimile reprinting could be considered (and not even that if the quality of the paper were a part of the work and one were concerned with pre- serving authorial intention). There is no doubt that the physical presen- tation of a verbal work conveys information about the cultural milieu in which the document was produced and can have an influence on readers, regardless of whether any visual effects were intended by the author. But many readers have always been interested in authorially intended texts and make an effort to exclude documentary features that they suspect were not so intended; thus authorial intention is a factor in the history of reading. Textual criticism properly studies all these interchanges over time, but any editions that result will inevitably follow different guidelines according to whether the focus is on authorial intention or social-cultural history. The intended texts of a verbal work and the varying physical texts aimed at conveying that work are all worthy of study, but understanding that "the texts of works" and "the texts of documents" are not synony- mous phrases is central to clear thinking about the texts of works made of language. This point applies equally to verbal works transmitted in oral form (as in nonliterate societies, but not only in them), for each oral rendition is a "document" and not necessarily the work. When the texts of such performances are written down (as they often are at some point, if only by anthropologists or other historians), a tangible documentary record becomes available for analysis by textual critics, supplementing any ongoing oral tradition. 2. Music The points that can be made about the nature of verbal works are directly applicable to thinking about music, even though the medium of music, sound, is less enigmatic than the ontology of language. What is immediately comparable about the two is that in each case the notation present on paper provides instruction for some kind of performance and is not in itself—except in unusual instances—part of the work of art. Com- posers do sometimes create scores that are meant to have visual appeal, but the result is not necessarily a mixed-media work, unless the composer intended that anyone listening to a performance of the music should also be looking at the score. Nevertheless, such scores limit the freedom of edi- tors to alter the design of the notation, in much the same way that shaped verbal texts do. Another similarity between musical scores and verbal texts on paper is that each can be the basis for a silent performance as well as a rendition out loud. Many people are adept at "hearing" music by reading scores, though when they do so, they are not experiencing the work in the medium in which its creator intended it to be experienced (unlike the silent readers of verbal texts). No two performances, silent or aloud, can ever be precisely identical, for the most that a score (like a tangible verbal text) can do is to provide a framework that encompasses, and delimits, a variety of performances. The composer Richard Wernick once said, "Conductors and compos- ers are privileged in that our training has given us the capacity to hear a piece of music as we see it on the written page. But, unfortunately, there is an intermediary between the music and the public." This comment was criticized as "silly" by a writer for the New York Times (John Rockwell, on 17 December 1989), but one understands what Wernick was getting at: every performance may depart from what the composer intended. To me, the problem with Wernick's statement is not the word "unfortunately" (which bothered Rockwell) but the idea that the musical work is present on paper and that those trained to read scores can experience "the mu- sic" directly. Will every trained reader of a score of Wernick's "hear" the music exactly as Wernick does? Will even Wernick "hear" it the same way every time he looks at it? In other words, the reader of a score is an "in- termediary" just as much as a person performing aloud. It is in the nature of works in intangible media that, however determinate the instructions for their recreation may be, the texts of the works themselves are always indeterminate. Textual critics of music have available to them not only written and printed texts but also evidence of specific performances, both in anecdotal accounts and in sound recordings. All this material is essen- tial for following the textual history of a piece of music over time, but only a part of it is relevant to the study of authorial intention. Editors of music have to realize, along with editors of verbal works, that no single text can accommodate all aspects of textual history simultaneously. And many of those who use or discuss editions of music need (like readers of verbal editions) to learn more fully what the function of a scholarly edition is. When Donal Henahan commented (20 March 1983) on the first volume ( Rigoletto ) of the University of Chicago critical edition of Verdi, he noted that not every "discovery or interpretation" in the edi- tion will be "honored" by every performer. "Interpreters," he said, "will always want to slip the bonds. The eternal struggle between purity and practicality is not merely inevitable but one of the dynamic forces that keep the musical world going around." This is a peculiar way to talk about a scholarly critical edition, especially since Henahan recognizes that the text is a product of critical judgment throughout and that the editorial annotation calls attention to many unresolved cruxes. To speak of "slip- ping the bonds" when one does not "honor" the text, which suggests that one is being a renegade, fails to acknowledge a primary aim of a scholarly edition: to give readers evidence for reconsidering the text. The poles of "purity" and "practicality" (if they are poles) have no meaning in relation to texts of music, or other works in intangible media. Accepting any text (scholarly or not) unquestioningly is not being "pure" but is simply being negligent; and departing from any text as a result of critical evaluation is not being "practical" but is simply being responsible—it shows an ac- ceptance, that is, of the responsibility that follows from understanding the status of texts as fallible instructions for the recreation of works. Whether one's goal is a stage of authorial intention (as in the Verdi edition) or a stage of a work's later development, the makeup of the tangible text is a matter of judgment, as is the range of performance that seems justified by it. Distinguishing between authorial intention and authorial expectation, which I have often found useful in discussing textual questions relating to verbal works, can also help to clarify textual dilemmas posed by music. Thus the amount of interpretive variation and outright embellishment engaged in by performers is a matter of convention that has differed from one period to another. Composers of the past naturally expected their work to be performed in whatever manner was conventional at the time, but their own textual intentions may have been different. (There is, for example, reason to believe that Verdi came to disapprove of some of the embellishments regularly added by singers in his time.) To the extent that evidence is available, textual criticism and scholarly editions should delin- eate intended texts as well as those that were actually heard by listeners. Furthermore, the concept of expectation helps to approach the issues argued about in the "early-music" debates of recent decades. Composers clearly expected their works to be performed on the instruments available in their own time, and they probably thought of the sounds produced by those instruments when they read music silently. But does it follow, as "early-music" adherents claim, that one is not being faithful to authorial intention if one listens to music played on instruments developed later than the composers' lifetimes? Not necessarily, if one regards composers' expectations about instruments as a separate matter from their intentions to have certain notes and interpretive instructions in their scores. The differing sounds of instruments made at different times are (like varia- tions in tempo and volume) just one of the variable aspects of individual performances. As the pianist Malcolm Bilson has pointed out (14 June 1998), instruments have always "played a role in determining interpreta- tion," and performing a work on instruments of different periods is one "avenue" for exploring what the music has to offer. The use of modern instruments for earlier music is not analogous to the modernizing of verbal texts, an issue that has generated equally ve- hement debate. Such modernizing normally refers to spelling and punc- tuation, and the equivalent in music would be the modernizing of the notation in scores; neither practice is defensible in scholarly editing since it deprives readers of textual elements that may be (and often are) relevant to interpretation. For verbal works, the equivalent of modern instruments would be modern pronunciation, which also is a feature of performance encompassed within the framework that is provided by the set of printed or handwritten instructions (a point not contradicted by the occasional presence of rhymes or puns that require earlier pronunciation). The aural texts of performances (including the nature of the sounds produced by varieties of the "same" instrument) are thus, for the most part, materials for social textual criticism (dealing with public texts and their reception), whereas the study of authorial intention is primarily focused on visible (notated) texts—at least when there is a written tradition that can be con- nected with the creator(s). But of course some music, like some verbal work, does not have a written tradition. Folk music of the past may have been transmitted by imitation over a long period of time before being written down, and at present there is music that has not yet been written down (as there was at any given moment of the past). Performances of pieces that originated in the past but that are not yet reported in written form or in sound record- ings (or for which there is an independent living tradition) have a different status for textual criticism from performances in the present by the person or persons who are creating or improvising the music as they perform it. Performances of the first kind provide evidence for recreating intended texts, whereas those of the second kind constitute the intended works themselves. Thus jazz, often created in performances of this second type, is analogous to such verbal (or partially verbal) works as those produced by performance artists and story-tellers. The comparison between works of music and those of verbal language brings to mind another connection: verbal texts are often combined with musical ones (as in songs and opera) to form mixed-media works. The fact that in vocal music some sounds are produced by human voices is not what makes such works mixed, for the voices are simply musical instru- ments; rather, the mixed-media status of these works is produced by the presence of words that have meaning apart from the music. (Opera is of course mixed in a further way because of its use of the physical art of stage sets and costumes.) Textual criticism of these verbal texts can be pursued as one would any other verbal text; and, in the case of those written as separate works (with no thought of their being set to music), variants from the original texts cannot be considered errors if they were the intended readings of the creators of the musical-verbal works. The many similari- ties between literature and music underlie the fact that in musicology as in literary scholarship there is a tradition of textual study; and many of the scholars currently engaged in editing music are well versed in the theoretical writings that editors of literature have produced. 3. Dance A work of dance may of course be transmitted by direct instruction from one choreographer or dancer to another. This kind of transmission, like the oral transmission of verbal works, presents at any moment the lat- est stage (or one of the latest stages) in a continuously evolving tradition. This social product may be judged aesthetically satisfying and is certainly of importance for cultural history. But another legitimate interest—in the intentions of the creator(s) of the work—may in many instances be more accurately conveyed by a physical document, even if the earliest surviving one does not go back to the time of the creator(s), since the text of any given document is relatively stable (barring unusual physical deteriora- tion). In any case, the physical recording of dance texts, like that of music texts, is obviously desirable. But there is a major difference in the histori- cal development of such recording in the two arts, for symbolic dance notation on paper (as opposed to written verbal accounts or printed step tablature) goes back only to 1700 (the Beauchamp-Feuillet system), and no one notation system even today has such widespread acceptance as the now conventional music notation does. It is instructive to look at the illustrations in Mary Ann Malkin's 2003 Dancing by the Book , which give a sense of the variety of systems proposed in the eighteenth century. At present, Labanotation, a system introduced in the 1920s, may be regarded as the dominant form, having been championed by the Dance Notation Bureau, which possesses over seven hundred Labanotated scores (see Erika Kinetz's article, 7 November 2005). The Benesh system, how- ever, has been favored by the Royal Ballet in London. Although stan- dardization is helpful, any comprehensible notation is important for the preservation of individual works. Nijinsky, for example, who was much interested in the problem, created his own notation and on more than one occasion wrote out a score for L'Après-midi d'un faune (as reported by Jennifer Dunning, 9 December 1989). Textual critics of dance may in some cases have variant texts on paper at their disposal; and any dance score—like any piece of musical or verbal notation—may contain erro- neous readings, identifiable both through an intimate knowledge of what is stylistically plausible for the choreographer in question and through recourse to such external sources as reviews and other contemporary commentary. If the search for appropriate notation has been a significant strand in dance history, another—not surprisingly—has been experimenta- tion with technology that can record movement. For many decades now, dances have routinely been filmed or videotaped, often from multiple angles. More recently, digital photography has been used, and there has been research on software (such as LabanDancer) to convert scores into animation. Computer programs are used by some choreographers as an aid to composition; and stages of their work, if saved, can give textual critics access to drafts. Motion-capture technology can create a digital record of a performance in a sequence of shifting lines and shapes, which can in turn be given vestigial human form. Trisha Brown's how long is an example of a dance piece that includes a video projection of a digital re- cord of the movements being made simultaneously by the human dancers. (It was discussed by Matthew Mirapaul on 13 April 2005.) A film record of a performance of this piece would thus also preserve a second kind of record of the movements involved. There have been choreographers who regard pictorial representations of dance as perhaps more valuable than scores. Martha Graham's admiration for certain still photographs of dancers is well known; and Murray Louis recently expressed satisfaction with the preservation of his legacy through videotapes of his repertory (reported by Anna Kisselgoff on 17 December 2005). One can understand how still and motion photography can be crucial for the study of an individual dancer's technique. And of course the tex- tual criticism of dance must take into account every kind of documenta- tion that exists for any given work. But the idea that a visual record of a dance might be superior to a score, or even render it unnecessary, simply because the dance is a visual form of art, betrays a misunderstanding of the relation of work and performance in the performing arts. Each visual record preserves only a single performance, which is an interpretation of a set of instructions; every performance is a postulation of the work, and the instructions accommodate them all, except when an interpretation goes beyond what can be regarded as implicit in the instructions. The instructions themselves may be consciously altered over time, as differ- ent generations adapt the work to their own sensibilities. But for anyone interested in authorial intention, even a film of a performance directed or performed by the choreographer has its deficiencies, since it still reflects only one occasion and since (even with multiple cameras) it cannot show everything that could be observed by viewers of the live performance. The situation is precisely the same as the one that exists in music, where no one performance can be a substitute for the score. Muriel Topaz, one of the directors of the Dance Notation Bureau, made the point well at a 1962 conference: a dance, she said, like works in any of the other per- forming arts, has "a substance, a compositional integrity that transcends the initial [and, one should add, any other] performance" (quoted in Jack Anderson's obituary of her, 1 May 2003). That transcendent integrity is distilled in the score or scores, which encompass various interpretations reflected in performance. Topaz's comment was concerned with the originating choreographer's intention, but it could be applied to the revising vision of later choreogra- phers who alter a piece. Pictorial evidence is of course basic for studying the history of performance and thus of reception. But for the history of intended texts, as they changed over time because of shifting intentions on the part of the creator of a piece as well as of others, scores are of crucial importance, when they exist (though pictorial evidence should in any case be scrutinized critically for clues to such intentions not available elsewhere). Scores may contain music notation and words along with the dance notation if the work includes music and/or words (sung or spoken), as most works of dance do. The music and/or words may have their own independent textual history, but once they are joined with dance, the cho- reographer's intention for them takes precedence over earlier intentions, and what might have been regarded as a textual error in the music or the words under other circumstances would not be erroneous if intended by the choreographer. Nevertheless, a dance score may contain errors in any of its conjoined elements, and a knowledge of the textual history of each of those elements gives an editor the basis for making emendations. What may seem to be an error in the musical text may be shown to be an error indeed by analyzing it in conjunction with the dance notation at the same point. The situation is in principle the same as that faced by textual critics of all mixed-media works, whether or not the elements in them have separate histories. 4. Film, Video, and Digital Art Confusion about the distinction between work and document in the field of film is epitomized by Andrew Pollack's article (16 March 1998) on the issues raised by digital film restoration. He points out that in an opening scene of Gone with the Wind there is a gap between a flagpole and the building to which it is supposed to be attached (showing that the scene was not a natural shot but was produced by special effects, ineptly handled). This error can be corrected digitally by scanning the frames involved and then copying and inserting certain pixels. But Pollack raises a question: "Should the flaw be fixed or retained as an intrinsic part of the original masterpiece?" The trouble with his question is that the "master- piece"—that is, the work—does not necessarily consist of everything that is on the film The levitating flagpole is no more a part of Gone with the Wind (the work) than the typographical error "fastidions" (for "fastidious") in the original American edition of Moby-Dick is a part of that work. Both are obvious flaws in the documents that make possible the transmission of those two works, but they are not parts of the works as intended by an one at any time. A printed edition of a verbal work, consisting of multiple supposedly (but not quite) identical copies, is analogous to the copies of a film made for distribution to theaters: in both cases, the multiplicity of copies allows for the simultaneous experiencing of the work at different locations, even though there is no guarantee in either case that the cop- ies, or the performances based on them (the silent or oral reading in the one case, the projection in the other), are the same. This point proves (if proof is needed) that cinematic works employ an intangible medium: the work is not a roll of celluloid but rather the sequence of moving images (now usually supplemented by sound) that it enables us to recreate. But we can never be sure whether the basis for this recreation is accurate—and whether the details of the projection lead to what was intended at any previous time. Intention is of course not the only possible aim, but people often seem to think that a choice has to be made between preserving the document and restoring authorial (or some other) intention. Pollack quotes and paraphrases Michael Friend (director of the film archive at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences) as follows: "The goal should be to 'restore the original achievement,' not the presumed original intention of the film maker." The statement would be clearer if Friend had said "document" instead of "achievement"; but the main point to be made about his comment is that there is no need to choose between the goals. It is always important for historical study to have the documents that were the basis for public showings in the past; but critically emended texts enable a fuller appreciation of the filmmaker's artistry. Another archivist opposed to editorial alteration also confuses the discussion. Pollack quotes Richard R. May (vice president of film preservation for Warner Brothers) as saying, "To change something just because we have the technology to do it, I am, and I think other archivists are, against it." Obviously the existence of technology is not in itself an appropriate reason for making a change; but when technology makes possible the correction of an error, it is a valuable tool for the study of artistic intentions. The matter of technical knowledge is worth pausing over for a mo- ment. The fact that digital technology did not exist when Gone with the Wind was made does not mean that using it to correct the flagpole error is an act of modernizing—for the correct flagpole image was achievable by special-effects technology in 1939. For the same reason there can be no objection to using modern technology to add an animal's missing foot in one frame of Fantasia . It is wrong to object to this kind of emendation by regarding it as "akin to efforts to fix the poor sense of perspective in pre- Renaissance paintings" (a view reported by Pollack). Restoring what was intended at a past time is not at all the same as imposing a more recent visual vocabulary on a work from the past. There have been, however, some attempts at film alteration that are indeed akin to revising pre-Renaissance perspective. The two best-known ones are probably stretch-printing and colorizing. The former attempts to smooth out the jerky, stylized movements in some silent films (such as Chaplin's) by repeating every second or third frame (see Walter Kerr's criticism of this practice, 1 July 1984). Colorizing obviously tries to make black-and-white films look as if they had been shot in color (the subject of many complaints in the Times , such as those by Vincent Canby on 2 and 30 November 1986). Neither of these techniques truly achieves its aim; but even if they were successful, they would be unjustifiable to anyone interested in authorial intention, for both involve changes in the visual language used by the filmmaker. Whether that language was employed by necessity or by choice (whether, for example, black-and-white photogra- phy was used in a film of 1920 or one of 1970), it was what the filmmaker was working with to express a vision. Those who defend stretch-printing and colorization without admitting that new works are thereby created put themselves in a position just as indefensible as those who think that the spelling and punctuation of a verbal work can be modernized without affecting meaning. In other words, a distinction must be made between, on the one hand, altering the cinematic vocabulary of a film (which is an act of adapta- tion, not a historical undertaking) and, on the other, correcting errors, reincorporating unauthorized deletions, or restoring degraded images (all of which aim to recover authorial intention). The latter category is il- lustrated by two "critical editions" of classic films that were unveiled in New York within a few days of each other in early 1989. On 30 January, a restored Gone with the Wind brought back the intended colors: a new negative had been made in a two-year process that involved combining the three original negatives (each for a different dye), thus resulting in new prints that were faithful to the original intention, unlike the degraded and unstable film stocks that had been used for showings in previous decades. On 8 February, a reconstructed Lawrence of Arabia restored twenty minutes of footage that had been deleted without David Lean's permission; it also corrected such errors as the reversed printing of the second reel (which had caused Lawrence's wristwatch to switch from one wrist to the other). (See the articles by Max Alexander and Janet Maslin on 29 January 1989.) These two "editions" show how the properly researched alteration of a received film text can produce a version that is closer to the intention of a director at a particular past time, just as the scholarly emendation of documentary verbal texts, when undertaken with a historical goal like the restoration of authorial intention, can take readers back to certain past moments more faithfully than can the documents that physically survive from the past. In both cases, given the relation of documents to works in these arts, the historic documents need not be damaged in the process of creating new texts. The fact that Lean did not approve of the cuts made in Lawrence of Arabia points to a major strand of film history that must be investigated by textual critics. Just as authors of verbal works have often felt that their artistic goals were compromised by the alterations demanded by publish- ers, many film directors have been angered but powerless in the face of deletions required by studios. The changes in each case are of interest for what they reveal about the cultural climate of the times that produced them, but textual critics will also wish to understand the stages of textual evolution that preceded publication or public release. Whether the evi- dence that leads to such knowledge can support the production of new texts varies from case to case, but in general one may say that the editor of a verbal work may more often be able to recreate the text of a deleted pas- sage than the editor of a cinematic work can, for even the survival of the script of lost footage does not in itself make possible the reassembly of all that would be required to reshoot it. Rarely can one expect to duplicate even the limited remaking that happened during the re-editing of Lawrence of Arabia: the original actors were asked to re-record lost portions of the soundtrack. That such an event took place underscores the mixed-media nature of cinema and video, allowing for the separate reconsideration and alteration of the soundtrack and the images. Orson Welles once said that the only film he was "allowed" to com- plete as he wished was Citizen Kane; his intentions for the others can be reclaimed only in varying degrees. One can write about his aims for The Magnificent Ambersons , but without the lost footage one cannot produce a new text. For Touch of Evil , however, there is not only a surviving preview print, which includes some later deleted material (fifteen minutes' worth), but also a memorandum by Welles detailing what he found unsatisfac- tory in the film as released. With those materials available, Walter Murch was able to prepare a new "edition" (for 1998 release, forty years after the original) that incorporates digital repairs, restoration of cut scenes, deletion of scenes added by the studio, a different structuring, and the replacement of Henry Mancini's music (the removal of which allowed the recovery of a suppressed layer of sound effects under it). (Murch's account of how his version follows Welles's memo "scrupulously" appeared on 6 September 1998.) Despite the expense of such restoration, there are other notable ex- amples, such as the 1993 re-editing of A Streetcar Named Desire , similarly made possible not only by the survival of excised footage but also by external sources, including Elia Kazan's autobiography. (See Bernard Weinraub's report, 16 September 1993.) This kind of careful recreation of directorially intended film texts is to be encouraged, and the advent of videocassette distribution of films for home viewing provided additional occasions for undertaking re-editing. A film like Angel Heart , which Alan Parker was forced to cut in order to receive an "R" rather than an "X" rating, was released in 1987 as a video with the uncut text. The trend toward providing home viewers with texts not available to theater audi- ences has expanded with the now seemingly established custom of in- cluding both commentary and excised footage on the digital video disks (DVDs) of commercial films. These disks have in effect become what are called documentary editions in the field of verbal-text editing: they aim to present an unaltered reproduction of a received text, accompanied by annotation and related documentary texts. I should add immediately, however, that the main text is "unaltered" in the sense that its constituent elements have not been changed; but the transfer from film to DVD, with the result that the work is viewed on a small (or relatively small) rather than a large screen, may in itself in many cases be a departure from authorial intention. This point does not of course apply to works made for video and computer-monitor viewing in the first place. The textual criticism of early television works is compli- cated by the fact that before the late 1940s there was no adequate means for preserving them and that the kinescope technology that followed was not very satisfactory. Early digital art poses a somewhat different problem for historical study: whereas there was no difficulty copying it, the programs and equipment for retrieving it sometimes became obsolete and unavailable. But despite the technological differences between celluloid film, videotape, and digital disks, the theoretical framework for textual criticism is the same. What is preserved in each visual document is not simply (as with recordings of music and films of dance) the record of an individual performance; rather it is (when displayed) a version of the work itself—that is, the version of it represented by the particular copy of the physical film being used. Nevertheless, the uncertainties attaching to the constitution of all works in intangible media remain present, since one may still question the content of the physical document and the manner of showing it. Mention of television and digital art requires a brief word about broadcasting—that is, the transmission (by radio waves, telephone, cable, and the like) of a visual or aural work from a central source to any number of locations simultaneously. Broadcasting is both a means of reproduction (as when a movie made for theaters is telecast or a concert is radiocast) and a means of original dissemination (as when a made-for-television documentary is released on a television network or when a work of digi- tal art is mounted on the artist's website). Broadcasting enables a work to be experienced in multiple places at the same time (given appropriate receiving equipment), without the need to transport any documents (like scripts, scores, or films) to those places. And it does not always require au- diences to be available at given tunes, since the internet and on-demand television channels allow viewers to choose their own times for looking at particular works. Although there are obviously significant differences be- tween broadcasting and other means of bringing visual and aural works to the public, the chief difference affecting textual criticism is the increased difficulty of ascertaining the variant texts that have been experienced. Individual television stations, for example, may alter the programs they receive from their network headquarters (especially by making deletions), and each viewer's television set or computer monitor may display the material somewhat differently. Yet so little of this information may be recoverable as to hamper severely the writing of comprehensive textual histories of works that have been broadcast. 5. Drama and Performance Art It is not surprising that textual critics of literature have written ex- tensively about drama, since plays are often read in printed form and since dramatic works—especially those by Shakespeare and his contemporaries—have figured heavily in the development of English- language textual criticism. Whereas earlier textual critics and editors of Renaissance drama focused on authorial intention (treating plays as they did nondramatic literature), some recent scholars have been more inter- ested in the performance texts of plays, arguing that drama is essentially a collaborative art. Although it is true that drama, like all performing arts, cannot normally be experienced in its intended form without col- laborative effort, it does not follow that playwrights' intentions are neces- sarily superseded by what emerges from the production process. Many playwrights, even when they participate in that so-called "development," are not fully sympathetic with the resulting evolution of their plays. Ter- rence McNally once said, "I worry that in the process of developing my new play I lose it" (7 December 1986). And Andrew Bergman, noting that movies "get filtered through other sensibilities," wanted to create a play that would, he said, "be my voice purely, the way a novel is." He rejected the idea of writing a screenplay: "I didn't want to have to open it up and put some action in it where I don't want to" (reported by Mervyn Rothstein, 12 April 1986). Bergman may have been unrealistic in imagin- ing the amount of control he would have in the theater, but he made his point of view very clear. A celebrated example of a dispute over the alteration of a playwright's intentions is the lawsuit brought by Samuel Beckett's American publishers and lawyers against the American Repertory Theater, whose director, Joanne Akalaitis, wished to set Endgame in a subway station rather than an empty room. Partly in response to this event, New York University in March 1985 held a panel discussion entitled "Authors versus Direc- tors: Who Has the Right of Interpretation?" Opinions were expressed on both sides (described by Samuel G. Freedman, 14 March 1985), but not much could have been expected from a discussion responding to such an unenlightened question. Thus John Guare's comment—"Theater is a collaborative art. But the playwright can choose who he or she wants to collaborate with"—was not helpful, being limited to performances of works by living playwrights (or during the life of a copyright) and over- simplifying the issues even for those cases. "Interpretation" by performers (whether or not so instructed by directors or authors) is a natural part of the recreation of works in intangible media. The key point for discussion should have been how to draw the line between interpretation that is in keeping with the author's intention and interpretation that goes beyond it and creates a different work. If the goal of a performance is compliance with authorial intention, the range of permissible interpretation is usually determined by the author-derived script, which in general (making allow- ances for errors and variants) is the primary set of authorial guidelines, subsuming certain kinds of interpretation. Thus the pacing of the action, the exact brightness and tone of the lighting, and the actors' manner of speaking can in many instances vary without violating the guidelines. But a change that contravenes explicitly stated directives (such as moving the setting of Beckett's play from a bare room to a subway station) is an act of "interpretation" not in line with authorial intention. If authorial intention is not a concern, directors are of course free to make such changes or more drastic ones (at least for works out of copy- right). And authorial intention need not be, and certainly is not, always the aim: works in intangible media can be expected to undergo all man- ner of changes in their performed texts over the years. Alterations not in line with authorial intention may seem aesthetic improvements to some people, and there is no reason in principle to disapprove of such changes. What may legitimately be deplored, however, is confused thinking about what does, or does not, conform with authorial intention and thus about whether or not a given performance is within the matrix of possibilities embodied in an authorial text. The range of those possibilities varies in inverse proportion to the explicitness of the stage directions and set descriptions. Some playwrights compose extremely detailed paragraphs of such commentary, which in published form make the plays read almost as novels but also provide sub- stantial insight into how the playwright visualized stage presentation. The use of furniture and other physical objects in staging is one indication of the mixed-media nature of drama, for such settings resemble installation art; but in drama, where physical details are usually ancillary, some of those details can be altered without violating the guidelines of the script, whereas in an installation any change of a detail (except one aimed at correcting an error) would compromise the artist's intended text. (These points obviously apply to stage settings in opera as well.) Controversy has recently arisen as to whether directors should be granted copyrights for their staging: playwrights believe that such copyrights would limit their control over their plays (the issue is commented on by Jesse Green, 29 January 2006). But since any given staging would normally not be the only one consistent with the authorially intended script (and might well be inconsistent with it), any copyrighted staging could not logically be tied to the copyright of the play, and permission to perform the play would not entail the use of that particular staging. Generally speaking, then, the consequential alteration of settings is an example of a directorial change that would depart from authorial inten- tion; but the exact pronunciation of the words would not—except when a particular dialect is specifically indicated—be a matter controlled by the concept of an authorially intended text. The 2004 Globe Theatre production of Romeo and Juliet in what was thought to be Elizabethan pronunciation was naturally an enlightening experiment in historical re- construction, just as there is a valid historical interest in hearing a piece of music played on instruments from the composer's time; but in neither case are those precise sounds dictated by authorial intention. Similarly, a filmed record of a dramatic performance, even one in which the play- wright was involved, does not supersede (though it may well supplement) a printed text, any more than a film of a dance work can replace choreo- graphic notation. In a cinematic work, of course, the angles of the shots selected for inclusion, as well as the pacing of the alternation between close-ups and more distant views, constitute the work; but for dance and drama, a film is only one limited record of one performance—and the performance itself cannot demonstrate all the possibilities inherent in the score or script. Performance art presents a somewhat different situation in that nor- mally the performer and the creator of the spoken language are the same person. (Lecturing is clearly one category of performance art.) There may or may not be a script or outline, but in any case whatever the per- former does and says reflects authorial intent, except in those instances where a mistake is made or where the performer is reluctantly conform- ing to the advice of someone else. Deciding when these situations obtain is one of the judgments that a textual critic must make. Similarly, when a performer-author adapts the language and action to a specific local situation, the textual critic must consider whether the adaptation is a departure from the essential work or whether the work encompasses all such variants that occur in individual performances. (The textual criti- cism of performance art, in other words, entails much the same process of thought as that applicable to jazz.) Filmed records of performance works are in one sense only documentation, since the work itself is the live performance. Yet these records have a different status from the filmed documentation of a conventional play, for the variants preserved in them (and perhaps nowhere else) may be parts of the intended work as much as if they had been written into a script. From the point of view of autho- rial intention, the work may comprise all (or many) of its variant perfor- mances; this observation, however, could be made about a conventional play only by thinking of the work as a social product rather than as a reflection of individual authorial intention. Sport, which involves impro- visation within clearly defined frameworks and plans, may be regarded as a genre—predominantly collaborative—of performance art; the textual history of a sporting event takes into account not only the various docu- mentary records of what happened but also the variations that occur, as a result of editorial decision or the equipment employed, when those records in visual media are shown on different occasions. Work in Tangible Media 6. Painting, Drawing, and Calligraphy One might at first believe that critical editions of paintings (as opposed to writings about the textual histories of paintings) would be extremely rare, since editorial emendations would alter the unique art objects, forc- ing viewers in each instance to look at the emended text, and it alone. Such results, one might imagine, would not often be permitted by own- ers of paintings. (An editor could of course make alterations on a photo- graphic or other reproduction of a painting rather than on the original, or alternatively could make a photographic record of the appearance of the original before beginning editorial work, but either way one or more of the versions would simply be reproductions, not the work expressed in the materials intended by the painter.) To some extent, this surmised rarity of scholarly editions of paintings is correct, for even when permis- sion to edit is given, there can be only one edition at any one time: each successive edition would obliterate the one that went before (except in the form of a photographic or digital record). The freedom of editors to create new editions is inevitably restricted in the case of works in tangible media—certainly as compared with the theoretically unlimited freedom editors have to edit works in intangible media, where documentary evi- dence need not be destroyed in the process. In another sense, however, there have been many more scholarly editions of paintings than might have been expected, for cleanings and "restorations" now routinely take place in museums. The technology for analyzing the underlying layers and chemical makeup of paintings (in- cluding infrared reflectography, Raman microspectrometry, and digital imaging) and the skill of the restorers who remove substances from, and add them to, paintings have become so sophisticated that museum cura- tors feel justified in allowing the editing of paintings to take place. Such editions often have a more dramatic effect on the text than occurs in edi- tions of works in intangible media: a cleaning, after all, affects the entire text, every square inch of it. Despite the impressive expertise that now generally underlies these operations, there are grounds for raising disqui- eting questions about them. In the first place, the goal of both cleaning and other kinds of restora- tion is normally final authorial intention—to bring the text of a painting back to what it was when the painter considered it finished. But this is not the only moment in the history of a painting that is of interest, and some would argue that it is not the moment of the greatest interest. However one feels about this matter, the fact remains that every painting, simply because it is a physical object, inevitably undergoes alterations over the years resulting from the atmospheric conditions under which it has been kept, and sometimes from accidental damage as well. The present state of each painting is a summation of all that has gone before and is the base on which its future evolution will rest. Unless the painting is recent, it surely will not look as it did when it left the painter's hands; but it probably has not looked that way for a considerable time, and many viewers will have responded to intermediate states. Any old painting that has been the sub- ject of commentary over the years will have presented a different appear- ance to different writers. Since modern technology allows the recovery of a great deal of the evidence that lies beneath the top layer of dirt and paint, textual critics can write accounts of the evolution of a painting and can offer illustrative reproductions of various stages in its history without taking any intrusive action that affects the physical object itself. Some people would therefore say that the editing of paintings should not take place at all (except perhaps to stop physical deterioration), leaving the body of evidence embedded in the object to remain untouched for future textual critics to examine, perhaps using even more advanced technology, and in any case perhaps arriving at different conclusions. This position values the physical evidence of the object and the con- stantly changing appearance of the work over the text of the painting as intended (at some point) by its creator. But the interest in artistic intention is great enough to cause many people to feel that the recovery of intended forms of paintings is worth the price of losing some of the accumulated evidence reflecting the history of the object. In instances where this view is dominant, there is still room for disagreement about the precise goal and about whether that goal has been achieved. An artist's intentions may change, not only during the process of original painting but also at a later time (after the painting was considered "finished"), and the layers of paint reflecting these changing intentions may be recoverable. Only one stage can be selected; and even if agreement were reached as to which is the most appropriate, there would probably still be disagreements as to how much needs to be removed from the present surface in order to reach the level that represents the desired stage. Was a given layer of paint, for example, applied by the original painter, perhaps overpainting a previ- ous "final" layer, or was it added by a later painter in order to make the painting conform better to a later taste? Can one tell the difference be- tween atmospheric contamination and the residue of the artist's method of obtaining a particular color or finish? These uncertainties are analogous to those attaching to critical edi- tions in every field, since any text that emerges from acts of judgment, however learned they may be, can be questioned by equally informed persons who would have made different judgments. Uncertainty, in other words, is unavoidable and has not prevented restoration projects from being undertaken for major works. One of the best known examples is the Vatican's long and painstaking program (beginning in 1980) of clean- ing Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel. The idea of removing the candle soot and other pollutants that have darkened these paintings may sound admirable in the abstract; but only the naïve could imagine that the process would not be problematic, and there have in fact been serious criticisms made by James Beck, Tuti Scialoja, and others. They have raised points that relate both to the long-term effects of the clean- ing and to the determination of artistic intention. They say, for example, that the surface dirt and wax may have served as a preservative and that removing them may expose the paints to potentially destructive modern pollutants. There is also the possibility that Michelangelo himself used candle soot and animal fat as darkening agents to create shadowy effects. Furthermore, arguments have been made that removing paint added af- ter the plaster was dry, as if it were overpainting by another hand, may at some points destroy Michelangelo's final touches, since he may sometimes have regarded the paint he placed on the wet plaster as a first draft. Thus the restorer's every act of alteration is an act of judgment; but unlike the rejection of a reading in a literary text, it cannot be reversed. (Two of the many instances of the Times coverage of the controversy over the Sistine restoration are articles by Douglas C. McGill on 6 November 1986 and by Mary Davis Suro on 4 January 1987.) If these problems illustrate some of the issues inevitably raised by criti- cal editing, another kind of problem—not inevitable—has also come up in connection with part of the Sistine work: lack of coherence in formulat- ing the goal of the restoration. Over the years, various forms of drapery were painted on forty nude bodies in the Last Judgment; but only the sev- enteen coverings added after 1750 were removed in the restoration. In defense of this retention of some of the coverings, Kathleen Brandt has said that the drapery was added "at the request of the patron, namely the papacy," and that it constitutes "a chart of notions of decorum over time." (See John Tagliabue's article, 9 April 1994.) But this reasoning would logically lead to preserving all forty of the additions. Even if one were to find a better justification for the significance of the 1750 state of the work, there would still be the inconsistency between the handling of this fresco and the others (in which the artist's final intention is the aim). One cannot—in a painted work or a printed text—simultaneously re- flect authorial intention and the accretions that emerged from later social circumstances. The current reputations of artists have a great deal to do with which accretions to paintings get preserved. No one would be likely to raise great objection to the removal of any of the added draperies in the Last Judgment , since they are by lesser painters than Michelangelo, nor would anyone wish Michelangelo's work to be removed in order to reveal the frescoes of Perugino that lie beneath. When the National Gallery in Lon don undertook to restore Bellini's The Feast of the Gods , completed in 1514, it decided to concentrate on the painting's appearance in 1529, since Titian made major additions to it at that time, and the idea of removing work by Titian could not be contemplated. Preserving the 1529 form of the work can be justified not simply on the grounds of Titian's stature but because it also keeps the portions of Dosso Dossi's intermediate revisions that were not covered over by Titian and thus reveals the social attitude toward painting texts in the sixteenth century, when an owner of a paint- ing was less concerned with maintaining its integrity as the work of a particular artist than with causing it to evolve in conformity with current taste. But of course the work that illustrates this important historical point cannot be regarded as a work by Bellini. The National Gallery's 1990 ex- hibition of the restored Feast admirably showed how modern technology allows some knowledge of a painting's textual history by displaying X-ray, infrared, and ultraviolet photographs of the underlying images along- side the presumed 1529 state of the oil. (On this exhibition, see Michael Kimmelman's 21 January 1990 piece.) One of the Louvre's great possessions, Veronese's Marriage at Cana , can serve as an epitome of the concerns and occurrences attendant on cleaning and restoration. The recent cleaning (1990–92) removed yellowed varnish, revealing bright colors not seen by viewers and commentators for a very long time. The restorers, using information obtained by X-ray and chemical tests, removed paint that they considered had been added by a different painter, thereby arousing a storm of protest from a group of artists. The most controversial decision was to change the color of the coat worn by a major figure in the foreground: the red layer was taken away, exposing the green one underneath. Critics argued that only the lower part of the red coat showed brushwork uncharacteristic of Veronese and that this area had been subjected to earlier repair; they also noted that the coat is red in the earliest known copy, made in 1607 (nineteen years after the artist's death). If the red was indeed Veronese's, part of his intended text is now lost, whereas evidence of his earlier extensive altera- tions, moving and inserting figures, is safe by being on a lower level and has been made visible by X-ray pictures. The X-ray investigation also made clear some of the vicissitudes endured by the physical object, for it has many repaired nail-holes, and it retains the signs of having been unstitched horizontally (to form two sections for ease of hanging) and then—fifty years later— of having been stitched back. As if to continue the punishment, an accident occurred when the canvas was being rehung in June 1992, resulting in several gashes, three of them about three feet long. An unexpected job of restoration was then required, in which the cut threads were individually glued together and retouched. (See Marlise Simons, 17 November 1992.) The object therefore tells the story of acci- dental and intentional mutilations, of the artist's changing intentions, and of several restorations. If the story is particularly dramatic in this case, the combination of elements that make it up is not at all uncommon as the underpinning of the texts of paintings that we now see. We are by now accustomed to significant textual revelations being brought about by modern technology applied to paintings. Even in the absence of surviving preliminary studies, we are beginning to have for some paintings the kind of evidence of revisions that literary scholars have long had for verbal works in the form of rough-draft holographs. (The same technology is of course being used in the literary field to un- cover words invisible or illegible to the naked eye.) Fortunately, museum exhibitions are also increasingly paying attention to the textual criticism of paintings, as in the Bellini and Veronese instances—or in the 2004 exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, showing that under the surface of Seurat's A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884 is evidence not only of his extensive revisions of figures and colors but also of his brush work, which originally consisted of conventional strokes, not pointillist dots. (See the report by Holland Cotter, 20 August 2004.) More discoveries will come, relating not only to oil paintings but also to works in watercolor, tempera, charcoal, and other media capable of covering up earlier drafts. Revisions in some media, like ink or pencil, may be more likely to involve erasure than cover-up, but such evidence as there is will be uncovered in those cases as well. Textual criticism of calligraphic art must also take into account the linguistic text formed by the characters, just as if the work were a concrete poem, which in some ways it is. Regardless of the amount of textual evidence available, all visual works that consist of the actual surfaces on which the artist made marks are ontologically the same and thus pose the same problems for textual criticism and scholarly editing. Since these works are so often presented in frames, it is perhaps worth adding that the same observations apply to frames as to the visual ele- ments in the presentation of tangible verbal texts: they very often have an effect on audience response, but they are not always intended as parts of the works. Frames, even if designed or selected by the creators of the works they enclose, may not be regarded by those creators as textual ele- ments in the works, though they must be taken into account in analyzing the history of responses to the works. And many of them are deserving of study as works of art in their own right. 7. Sculpture, Craft, and Installation Art The extent to which some of the evidence for the textual history of a piece of sculpture can be found in the object itself varies according to the material out of which the work is made, just as it does in the case of two-dimensional works (that is, essentially two-dimensional ones, despite the three-dimensional surface of paint or collage). Sculptures produced by cutting material away, like those in marble or wood, do not readily provide evidence of previous drafts. Any cuts that the sculptor regarded as mistakes are obliterated by new cuts or were made to fit into a revised plan for the area involved. Analysis by a textual critic may suggest likely spots where such alterations occurred, but no editorial emendation would follow because the artist's final intentions are reflected in those altera- tions. (It is as if a writer, having made a slip of the pen, incorporated the accidental reading into the final form of the sentence—an analogy that can have an exact sculptural parallel, when a letter-cutter makes a mis- take in carving an inscription in stone or wood.) And no one would be likely to propose recreating a hypothetical earlier intention at the price of destroying the final one—or would be allowed to undertake the task, if proposed, in any form other than a replica. On the other hand, sculp- tures produced by casting or by a process of building up or adding on, as with some works in metal, glass, or other materials (where separate units are affixed to each other), may on occasion offer more internal evidence of revision, but rarely on the scale of what technology has uncovered beneath the surfaces of paintings. External evidence, as in sketches or models, may of course exist, as it may for works of any genre; and such evidence, when it exists at all, is more likely to be the only evidence than is the case with painting. The issues faced by editors of sculpture were discussed in a front-page article in the New York Times on 15 July 2003, written by Alan Riding to explain the international controversy aroused by plans to clean Michel- angelo's David . Riding asked, "Should the marble colossus be restored to its original perfection or simply cleaned of grime? Or should it learn to live with the inevitable streaks and blotches of venerable old age?" These two questions, though not carefully phrased, allude to the two basic ap- proaches available to all editors: the critical approach, in which altera- tions are made with the goal of recreating a previous version of a work (as intended at some past moment but not fully realized in any surviving artifact); and the documentary, in which no changes are made to the inherited state of a work, thus preserving the cumulative effects of its his- tory. The former, as set out by Riding, subsumes two activities, restoring and cleaning. But it is important to understand that cleaning is a form of restoring, for its goal is the restoration of a work's earlier appearance. And Riding's use of the word "simply" in connection with cleaning implies, incorrectly, that it is necessarily less intrusive or less a matter of judgment than the kind of restoring that involves additions. In cleaning marble, for example, a decision has to be made not only about how much to take off but also between a dry method (using brushes and rubbing) and a wet one (using poultices), each of which has a different effect on the pores of the stone and produces a different look. Even though cleaning certainly involves critical judgment, there is un- deniably a widespread perception that a restoration consisting of cleaning alone is more conservative (that is, safer) than one that also includes such actions as filling cracks and nicks or supplying a replacement element (like the marble and plaster substitute toe that was added to the David in 1991). The argument that a less intrusive procedure (whatever it may be) is more justifiable can perhaps be supported on practical grounds for works in tangible media, though it can never be supported logically. It is reminis- cent of the claim made with pride by some literary editors that they have tried to keep their alterations to a minimum. But in a critical edition one must make whatever changes are necessary to bring about the desired goal, and there is no virtue in doing less than that out of respect for the misguided notion that a small number of changes is desirable in itself. But such editions do not affect the documentary evidence, whereas in the case of sculpture and other works in physical media there are good practical grounds for protecting such evidence at the price of editorial illogic. In any case there would be no possibility of restoring the authori- ally intended texts of many sculptures, particularly those kept outdoors and made of materials that can be irreversibly affected by exposure to weather. When Riding asked whether the David should be "restored to its original perfection," he knew that he was not describing a realizable goal, for later in the article he quoted a restorer who pointed out that "there is not one millimeter of its original surface left"—partly as a re- sult of weather damage, partly because of an 1843 cleaning that used hydrochloric acid. The application of a new surface, though a theoretical editorial possibility, would surely not be permitted, and it probably should not be permitted, because one could persuasively argue that in this situ- ation the editorial emendation is too conjectural to force on all viewers of the work (unlike what happens with editorial conjectures in literature, which leave readers free to experience the work without them). Even in cases where the surface is not severely damaged, bringing a work back to "its original perfection" would always be conjectural, as critical editing necessarily is, and Riding's statement—like any expression of the goal of critical restoration—should include wording that acknowledges the contingencies inherent in such an aim. One must also remember, when speaking of sculpture, that weather-produced alterations may sometimes actually produce authorially intended texts, for sculptors may take into account the changes (as in the colors of metals) that their materials will undergo. Although there is always reason to be interested in textual shifts over time, even when not intended by the creators of works, here is a situ- ation in which some later changes—brought about by the course of time and not by a scholarly editor—can be accepted as representing authorial intention. The attempt to restore the intended texts of some modern sculptures poses an additional difficulty in that these sculptures may contain a wider range of fragile materials than earlier sculptures do. When such elements show deterioration or damage, conservators hope to find replacement parts; but identifying the source of the materials and trying to learn whether they are still available are not easy tasks. For this reason Carol Mancusi- Ungaro, now the director of conservation at the Whitney Museum, began in the mid-1980s a video oral-history project in which artists (painters as well as sculptors) are asked to give advice on the conservation of their own works (see Randy Kennedy's account, 29 June 2006). These conversations are valuable documents in ways that go beyond their original purpose, for artists' comments on the specific materials they used naturally lead to broader reflections on what they meant to convey in their works. But the textual usefulness of these interviews is not as straightforward as some might imagine. Any specific identifications of materials and their sources, when an artist's memory is accurate, can indeed be helpful in restoring a text; but one must remember that any recommendations as to what ought to be done reflect the artist's thinking at the time of the conversation and may, if carried out, produce a new version of the work. The result of an interview, then, may be to provide one more stage of authorial intention for the conservator-editor (who can select only one) to consider. There are of course many other three-dimensional objects, the prod- ucts of human creativity just as sculpture is, that are not usually called "sculpture." Conventionally these objects have been regarded as examples of "craft" or "design" or "decorative art" rather than of "fine art," but this distinction does not have an ontological basis, or even one founded on the genres of works involved. Fortunately art museums, and not simply museums with anthropological interests, have increasingly recognized the importance of "crafts," and specialized craft museums have also been es- tablished. For present purposes, it is not necessary to worry about these divisions, for the same points can be made about the texts of such objects as about the texts of those usually called sculptures. This point, though not stated in terms of "texts," was at the heart of a 1990 conference held at the American Craft Museum in New York (and reported by Roberta Smith on 22 January 1990), where George A. Kubler reiterated (in the words of an earlier book of his) that "the idea of art can be expanded to embrace the whole range of man-made things." Because many of those things usually regarded as craft are utilitarian objects, the study of their original states can be particularly difficult, owing to the wear that comes with use and to the fact that people rarely hesitate to alter their utensils, furniture, and clothing when alterations will improve (in their view) the functioning of the objects. One may justifiably be interested in the authorially intended texts of such objects (whether created by anonymous artisans or famous silver- smiths, cabinetmakers, and couturiers) as well as the texts that evolved through use and the passage of time. The textual stages that are tradi- tionally preferred vary according to the medium: curators of silver wish to remove tarnish (as grime is lifted from paintings), whereas specialists in old furniture prize the patina it acquires over time. These are simply matters of convention, for every stage in the life-story of every object is of historical and aesthetic interest. Even so, there is a particular appeal in the current state of any utilitarian object, since it bears the traces of the object's shared life with human beings. For this reason Brian Murphy, in his 2005 book on Persian rugs, The Root of Wild Madder , takes the view that wear and what might be called imperfections (such as awkward repairs) are not objectionable. As Kubler eloquently put it at the craft conference (making the case in fact for the social approach to all art): "to be in use among the young who transmute and re-enact the work of the dead is the best of all eternities." None of this negates an interest in the earlier (or earliest) states of objects; but it does suggest that the destruction of later evidence in an effort to bring back an earlier state may often be harder to justify for "crafts" than for "arts" in the minds of many people. Stained-glass art, often classified as a craft, can afford unusual op- portunities for uncovering post-production textual histories, especially in such complicated structures as windows made up of many individual pieces of glass held together by lead strips. The sophisticated research now being done is illustrated by Drew Anderson's detailed reports on the Gothic windows at the Cloisters in Manhattan. After comparing current and earlier photographs of a window digitally and making rubbings of each piece of glass, Anderson describes the deterioration, amateur repairs (such as the insertion of any piece of glass that came to hand and the enlarging of the lead to hold it in), and previous conservation efforts that have occurred at each spot in the window. He is thus reading the windows in much the same way that analytical bibliographers read the physical evidence in books—a point that is particularly apt since medieval picto- rial windows were meant to function in part as books, conveying biblical stories to those who could not read. Textual critics must always try to extract the story that the physical details tell, as preparation for evaluat- ing the text of the work. "Each window tells its own story," Anderson says. "And the more you work on them, the more you find out" (quoted by Carol Vogel, 17 June 2006). This knowledge helps one to appreciate the work, whether or not any editorial alterations seem advisable; and in the case of stained-glass windows, attempting to recreate their original condition would often be incompatible with preservation, since cleaning can alter the colors. The situation once again illustrates how, with works in tangible media, practical considerations may limit the editorial activity that follows from a detailed knowledge of textual history. Installation art, another form of sculpture, poses a few additional tex- tual problems. Because installations are likely to consist of a variety of objects and because the spatial relationships among them are crucial to the work, the task of moving an installation (if it is not a site-specific one) to a different location is especially challenging. Although it is possible to recreate an installation precisely, so long as all the same objects remain available, it is likely that there will be small textual differences (at least) in each reinstallation. If the artist supervises reinstallations, any differ- ences may constitute authorially intended versions, unless they result from concessions made in deference to a particular space, in which case they are analogous to adaptations for a special audience. Exact reinstallations require exact measurements of the original installation; photographs are obviously not adequate, and any sketches or notes by the artist do not necessarily predict or record what the artist actually did in setting up the original installation. Furthermore, installations are in many instances mixed-media works par excellence , combining sculptural items, paintings, photographs, videos or film loops, music or other sound, verbal texts in visible form, and so on. Textual criticism and scholarly editing of such works therefore involve the issues characteristic of each of the media in- dividually, as well as the analysis of the texts that have resulted from the combination. 8. Architecture, Interior Design, and Gardening As a class, works of architecture undergo significant alterations at the hands of their owners more often than any other works of art. The changes go far beyond the repairs necessitated by aging and weathering; they often involve the construction of new rooms and wings, the recon- figuration of existing rooms, and the attachment of decorative elements and coverings to the exterior, perhaps totally transforming its appear- ance. Because buildings are meant to be inhabited, they are like large- scale utensils, which preserve the traces of daily use as well as conscious alteration aimed at increasing utility. The architect's original intentions are less important to many (probably most) owners than creating spaces that they deem more convenient or attractive. The present text of every house or office building is interesting (like the present state of all works of art in physical media) as the momentary culmination of its interaction with human beings. The textual history of a structure is often partly vis- ible without any prodding beneath the surface, but a great many details are always hidden from sight. Some of them can be learned in the course of ordinary repairs, but uncovering others may require the destruction of part of what is presently visible. The decision as to whether such destruction is justifiable—whether what is recovered is more desirable than what is lost—involves essentially the same issues that arise with any other work of physical art, despite the fact that buildings have a utilitarian function. There are increasing numbers of owners of old houses who are eager not simply to preserve what they possess but to restore it to what it was at a previous time, re- gardless of whether the result will be more, or less, comfortable. Thus the scholarly editing of buildings is not an uncommon activity, encouraged by the historic preservation movement. Preservation at the most basic level is of course the prevention of destruction, but it inevitably leads to a second stage: since buildings require maintenance for survival, repairs (textual emendations) must be made, and if they are to be made responsi- bly, they must be directed toward a stated goal. As with all critical editing, one must first decide what point in the textual history of the work is to be the focus—the latest, the earliest, or some intermediate one. And after the historical moment is settled on, one must determine what evidence there is for recreating it—whether, indeed, there is enough to make the attempt possible. Among the factors that often affect the answer to the first of these questions is the presence of alterations and additions made by a cele- brated architect. The 1980s restoration of the main immigration building on Ellis Island, for example, did not have as its goal the original 1900 state but rather that of 1918, when the Guastavino tile vaults were added. (See Paul Goldberger's discussion, 14 August 1990.) Christopher Wren's great addition to Hampton Court Palace in the 1690s destroyed a Tudor courtyard, but no one would be likely to advocate returning the palace to the form in which Henry VIII experienced it, since Wren's work would be lost in the process. So when a serious fire in 1986 gutted the south wing of Wren's addition, any course of action other than restoration seemed unthinkable. Surviving fragments (crystal, fabric, wood carving, and the like) were pieced together with newly fabricated matching material. The resulting mixture is not unlike what exists in the older parts of the palace (or any other old building that has undergone repair). As Simon Thurley, a curator at Hampton Court, said, "half of the 'Tudor' brick walls are not really Tudor, and some are 19th-century" (quoted by Sherry Marker, 28 March 1993). The line between restoration and replica is not a distinct one, for any emendation that involves new material can only produce an approximation of the intended text, since the medium is physical and the new material is a different physical object. Determining the past time to be aimed for in a restoration is occa- sionally taken out of the owner's hands if the building is located within a designated historic district that has rules governing such matters. Gener- ally the regulations insist on the preservation of the mix that existed at the time the rules went into effect (with some alterations allowed by ad hoc permission); the focus, in other words, is on the social text—of each house, as it has evolved, and of the neighborhood as a whole. The prob- lems that can arise are epitomized by a case that occurred in the 1980s in East Hampton, Long Island. The owners of an eighteenth-century house in the historic center of the village removed a Victorian porch that had been added, because they preferred the house to look as it had in 1790 and not to be an amalgam of the styles of two periods. They had unwit- tingly failed to apply for a certificate of appropriateness, but it would not have been granted in any case, for the Design Review Board argued that the Victorian "Boardinghouse Era" was a distinctive part of the village's history, and it ruled that the porch had to be built back. This decision seems questionable—since the materials of which the porch was constructed had been destroyed and since the porchless version of the house does represent another period of East Hampton history—but I am concerned less with the rightness of the decision than with what this episode illustrates about the editing of buildings. Judgment is naturally involved, as it is in all editing, and judgment is often affected by fashion, by evaluations embedded in the cultural milieu. Thus Robert Hefner, a preservationist employed by East Hampton, noted, "Thirty years ago a restoration architect would say, 'Rip this porch off.' The philosophy was to go back to the original form. Now preservation philosophy is more refined and objective, taking into account historical periods" (quoted by Michael Winerip, 20 July 1990). Although one might question "refined" and "objective," there is no doubt about the main point: shifting scholarly and intellectual predispositions influence editorial decisions. Preserving the mixture of period styles that are the natural byproduct of a function- ing community may not be "objective," but it is certainly cautious, since evidence of past living is not intentionally destroyed. One cannot help but think of the contrast between East Hampton's firm (perhaps obstinate) insistence on preserving the historical record and Colonial Williamsburg's equally inflexible desire to erase the nineteenth century. The question of what evidence there is for a restoration, when res- toration (to whatever moment) is settled upon, involves recognizing that surviving plans or other external documents cannot be accepted at face value. A plan may of course indicate what an architect intended at the time when it was drawn, but the building may have been built in a dif- ferent way—because the builder did not follow the plan, or the architect had second thoughts (possibly recorded on a now-missing plan), or the client asked for alterations. Evidence of the inadequacy of plans turns up all the time: to cite only one instance, when restoration of the ship Moni- tor was being considered, it was found, as William J. Broad states, that its "remains are often quite different from plans and period drawings" (30 July 2002). Complex structures like buildings and ships, which in- volve assembly from disparate parts, frequently contain within themselves many indications of their own history; and sophisticated techniques are now available to restoration architects for uncovering such evidence, as when they determine the sequence and dates of multiple layers of paint. When intrusive procedures (involving cutting, stripping, or even par- tial demolition) are deemed necessary—whether the occasion is resto- ration or remodeling—one is brought face to face with the actions of human beings in the past with an immediacy not often matched by tex- tual investigations into other arts. Whenever Paul Eisemann, a New York carpenter, cuts into a wall, "he views it [according to John Freeman Gill] as an opportunity to practice a kind of workingman's archaeology." Eise- mann says that "buildings will talk to you if you listen"; for example, when "you can see the original mortar on brickwork, sometimes you can tell what group of immigrants did the work" (1 January 2006). As one undoes past work—pulling out an old nail, for instance—one learns something about the technique and attitude of the person who did the work in the first place. When Verlyn Klinkenborg was taking apart the oldest room of his house, he thought of the original carpenter and "how solidly he did his job. He stinted nothing when it came to lumber and nails and, especially, screws." Behind the walls "there is another house and another set of lives." Klinkenborg, intrigued by the decisions of previous owners, recognizes that future owners will equally marvel at his own decisions. "The trouble," he says, "is that you can see only what remains—not what has been erased. When I'm finished with my work, an era in the life of this house will have vanished" (25 November 2005). This is the essence of textual alterations in physical media, but at least in the case of buildings there still often remains enough evidence for detailed textual histories to be recovered. The wall decoration, furnishings, and arrangement of objects within a house, or the landscaping and gardens that surround a house, may or may not have been created by the same person who designed the house. From the point of view of authorial intention, the extent to which a house, its interior decoration, and its gardens can be approached as a single work will vary with the circumstances; but from the social or audience-response point of view, they are always inextricable, since they are experienced together, and the ensemble affects one's response to each element. One object that landscape architecture and interior design share with other architecture is that of creating spaces to be lived in—they are all "living rooms"—and thus gardens and room decorations, like houses, often undergo textual alterations to accommodate their owners' changing needs and tastes. Interior design, textually considered, involves the same questions as installation art, for both create arrangements of objects to be experienced within defined spaces—though interior design is more frequently altered, since owners of houses usually regard it as a utilitarian craft rather than a "fine" art. The textual criticism of designed landscape must take into account the primary fact that distinguishes it from the textual study of buildings and room decoration: the predominant elements in such texts are living plants that change continuously. The human-made inanimate objects in gardens—like flagstones, sundials, and statuary—are no different textu- ally from sculpture and craft. But whereas sculptors and architects of buildings often take into account the effects that weather will have on the materials they use, they do not have to think about variations that are perceptible on a daily basis. The plan for a garden, whether on paper or in the mind, provides a framework that subsumes the constantly changing details of the stages of growth of the individual plants as well as the altera- tions produced by necessary maintenance. Such changes are part of what is intended (by the original designer or a later one who modifies the earlier plan); the elements that are intended to be relatively more stable include color, height, and massing, as well as the specific varieties of plants. Thus the only editorial emendations that are at odds with what was intended are those that change elements of this kind and their relationships. (That the textual history of gardens has been flourishing is suggested by the intense interest in the work of Gertrude Jekyll and Beatrix Farrand, by programs of the National Trust in England and the Smithsonian Institu- tion in America, and by the existence of the Thomas Jefferson Center for Historic Plants at Monticello and Mac Griswold's Sylvester Manor Proj- ect on Shelter Island.) Because plants are living and changing, they bring an element of the performing arts to the tangible-medium art of garden- ing; for that reason, the relation of written plans or designs to gardens is like that of scripts and scores to drama and music. 9. Printmaking, Photography, and Book Design The ability of audiences in different locations to experience a work simultaneously is primarily associated with works in intangible media, where multiple copies of notation for recreating the works can be widely distributed. But some works using tangible media can exist in a number of exemplars if the artist chooses to create an intermediate object that pro- vides the means for mechanically producing multiple copies. Sculptures in liquefiable materials like metal or glass, for example, are sometimes cast in molds; and when the process and results are supervised and ap- proved by the sculptor, each resulting piece constitutes the work from the point of view of authorial intention. The most voluminous category of visual art intended to exist in multiple exemplars consists of those works on paper that are usually called "prints." Before photography (to which we shall turn in a moment), the intermediate objects used to "print" the paper with ink could take various forms, offering three classes of printing surface: a relief (protruding) surface, as on a woodblock, where the area not to print is cut away; an intaglio (or sunken) surface, as on a metal plate prepared for engraving or etching, where grooves are cut to hold the ink that will be transferred to the paper; and a planographic (level) surface, as on a lithographic stone, where the greasy lines of a crayon drawing will hold the ink. These differing processes naturally affect the character of the prints that result, and an understanding of them is therefore relevant to textual criticism as well as to art criticism, for textual criticism (in any field) can never be divorced from the effort to understand and appreciate the works it addresses. But the differences among these production pro- cesses need not be pursued here since the same textual issues are raised by all of them. The fundamental textual question to be asked about prints is how each of several exemplars can equally be "the work." One answer, from the point of view of authorial intention, is that if the artist approves these exemplars and regards them as "the same," each one by definition is the work. (The artist who makes the image sometimes does the work of pre- paring the intermediate object and printing from it, though often one or both of those operations are performed by others, subject to the artist's approval.) But of course the exemplars cannot possibly be the same in ev- ery minute detail, for no two physical objects ever are. Even without hu- man intervention—that is, intentional alteration—prints may vary as a result of inking differences, for example, or the deterioration of the block or plate as a result of wear and the passage of time. The artist may reject and destroy certain copies, but even those that are saved and approved are bound to have slight textual differences. What "the same" means here can only be that the differences are so small as not to be regarded as meaningful by the artist. Nevertheless, they may be noticeable to viewers, whose responses may be affected. Alternatively, perhaps the artist does not regard all the copies as essentially the same but is willing to consider the variations as falling within the intended conception of a given work. Either way, the idea that the work exists in each exemplar is shattered: one ideally needs to see every copy in order to experience the full range of textual nuance present in the "work," now taken to comprise the totality of all the exemplars. (This point reminds one of the comparable necessity, in studying the texts of verbal and musical works transmitted in printed editions, of examining multiple copies.) However impractical the goal of seeing every copy may be, it is worth pursuing because the differences one will locate may go beyond the small (but not necessarily insignificant) variants created by the printing process. They may also include alterations made by the artist (or at the artist's direction), reflecting early trials or changed intentions. Although a block, plate, or stone may not carry clear evidence of the alterations made to it, the impressions taken from it at various times do serve as a record of the states (or some of them) that it has gone through. This point was illustrated by a 2004 exhibition at the Frick Collection called "The Un- finished Print," which gave viewers the opportunity of comparing prints made from the same plates at different times (see Roberta Smith's ac- count, 4 June 2004). One of the most dramatic examples consisted of the first and eighth states of Félix Bracquemond's etched portrait of Edmond de Goncourt, which are different enough that they could be regarded as separate works. Although the title of the exhibition implied that states prior to the last are "unfinished" (as some in the show clearly were), there is no reason that more than one finished state cannot exist, each representing the artist's final intention at a particular time. In the case of Blake's illuminated books, Joseph Viscomi has brilliantly shown—in his 1993 Blake and the Idea of the Book —that the impressions made at one time, though differing in small ways, share certain characteristics that link them together and distinguish them as a group from the impressions made at another time. Thus a comprehensive examination of the impres- sions taken from a given plate puts one in a position to judge (and it is always a matter of judgment) which textual differences can be subsumed under a single version and which create another version (or even perhaps a distinct work). The full textual history of an image created for printing includes forms not intended by the artist, and they often exist in quantity, for a block or plate can be used for printing (and be altered) by persons not associ- ated with the artist; and even if the block or print does not survive, there has been the possibility, for the past century and a half, of reproducing the image by various photographic means. An important distinction for textual criticism is the one conventionally made between a "print" and a "reproduction": the former is the direct product of the block, plate, or stone on which an image was created, whereas the latter is at least another generation removed, being a copy (photographic, xerographic, digital, and the like) either of a print or of another reproduction. (The term "re- productive print" is sometimes used to signify a print made from an object that did not involve the collaboration of the original creator of the image, as when a copyist engraves a plate after a painting, without the painter's oversight; but of course such a print is still a print, not a reproduction, so long as it is made directly from the plate.) Whether or not one is focusing on authorial intention, this distinction is of intense textual significance, since it refers to differences that profoundly affect viewers' responses. A print pulled from a relief or intaglio surface, for example, has three- dimensional attributes, whereas a reproduction of such a print normally lacks them. Even a reproduction of a lithographic print shows differences, if less dramatic. Yet the number of people who have experienced repro- ductions of famous print-images is far greater than those who have seen the prints themselves; and any study of the history of these works has to take into account not only the prints, with all their variations, but all the reproductions as well. The art of photography raises the same considerations, since the pho- tographic print is produced from an intermediate object, the negative (reflecting choices made with the camera and the developing), and since the handling of the printing process can lead to variant texts among the finished prints. (Digital photography and printing employ different tech- nology from traditional photography, but the textual upshot is that varia- tions, including gross manipulation of the images, can be produced more easily.) Furthermore, the distinction between prints and reproductions is just as applicable (even though photography is the most common process used for making reproductions), since a print is produced directly from the artist's negative, whereas a reproduction is derived from a photograph of one of the prints (or from another reproduction). A good example of a photographer's changing intentions, as seen in variant prints from the same negative, is offered by Ansel Adams. Late in his life, he reinter- preted many of his earlier pictures by printing from the old negatives in a way that replaced "elegance with melodrama," in the words of John Szarkowski's 2001 exhibition catalogue, Ansel Adams at 100 (quoted in Sarah Boxer's review, 1 September 2001). For Adams, each act of printing could be seen in terms of the perform- ing arts: "the negative," he said in 1943 (and often repeated the idea), "can … be compared to a musical score. It's ready for its performance— the print. … it can be performed so as to recreate the original visual- ized intention." But it can also be performed, as his own later printing showed, in a way that reflects a different intention. Although a musical work can similarly be performed in diverse ways, Adams's comparison of photography and music cannot usefully be carried further and indeed is seriously misleading. Because musical works use an intangible medium, they must be recreated (performed) each time they are experienced (that is, in their intended "live" form, not as a recorded reproduction). But photographs, which use a tangible medium and are stationary, do not need to be printed afresh whenever one wishes to experience them, since prints made earlier are physical objects that can be handed down through time. What "performance" means in the two cases is very different: in music it is an integral part of the work, whereas in photography it is part of the work's prehistory. And these points remain the same whether one is talking about authorial intention or the intentions of others. Another art form involving multiple exemplars—each of which is a "print" of an image transferred from an intermediate object—is the de- sign of printed books, magazines, and newspapers (and of their constituent parts like advertisements). As with the kinds of prints just discussed, which can preserve evidence of changes in the underlying plates and negatives (and other such objects), books and periodicals from a single edition (a single act of typographical layout and design) vary among themselves as a result of changes, both intentional and accidental, in the type-formes or plates used—changes that may occur during one printing session or between such sessions. The conventional terminology used by bibliogra- phers is different from that used by art historians, and both have their limitations. In the book field, an "impression" (or "printing") comprises all the units produced in a single continuous session (of however many hours or days are required to complete the desired number of copies), and a second distinct session, separated in time from the first, produces another impression. In the study of art prints and posters, on the other hand, each copy is called an impression—a usage that makes more literal sense, since each one does result from a separate act of impressing (or at least printing on) the paper. If the usage in art thus accords better with the fact that each copy is (if only slightly) different, the bibliographical usage more clearly accommodates another reality, that a group of copies made in one limited period of time may share characteristics not present in groups of copies made in other periods. But the terminology, despite its awkwardness, should not prevent tex- tual critics of any of these arts from dealing with variations. The existence of differences among copies of any given edition of a printed book is widely understood by editors of verbal texts, for whom such variations are part of the textual history of the works they are investigating. But every edition can of course be viewed as a work of visual art, in which the art- istry of type designers, papermakers, and (sometimes) binders is deployed in a particular way by a book designer; and verbal variation is only one of the many sources of difference among the exemplars of any such work. (I am speaking here only of conventional books; artists also create quasi- book objects that are best regarded as works of sculpture.) Even when design drafts, pieces of type, type-formes, proofs, and other preliminary materials survive, the primary evidence for the textual history of a piece of book design is found in the finished objects themselves, since their production over time allows them collectively to preserve a record of the variations that occurred (or some of them). Approaching books as visual art rather than as vehicles for transmitting verbal language brings us full circle from where we began. These notes are intended to illustrate a way of thinking, not to be com- prehensive. Nor are the sections into which I have divided them meant to be self-contained: certain issues are dealt with more fully under one head- ing than under another, but many of those issues are equally applicable to all the discussions. This interdependence reflects the fact that all the arts are related and that thinking about the textual criticism of one art can clarify the thinking about others, including those I have not touched on, such as the olfactory and gustatory arts. After all, texts of every kind of human creation are unstable (like the natural objects studied by scien- tists), and it is this basic condition that textual critics in all fields are track- ing. They are historians of metamorphosis, chronicling the changes that have in turn affected the responses to human works at different times. Textual critics' recognition of the inescapability of impermanence is not at odds, however, with the urge to produce scholarly editions, which are attempts to help an audience to encounter various past moments in the history of a work, rather than merely to read about them. How textual criticism and scholarly editing are carried out is contingent not only on the surviving evidence but on the distinctive characteristics of the different media in which works can be created. Yet the primary issues are identical, and that is why textual study in any field can benefit from being conducted with a knowledge of the questions that have arisen, and the answers that have been offered, in other fields. Approaching every human creation with an understanding of its textual history, seen against the panorama of all other textual histories, helps us to appreciate the humanity movingly embedded in each version of a work and to enjoy the hard-won accomplishment represented there. Martin Boghardt: A Memoir by PAUL NEEDHAM * * This essay is a slightly revised version of my Introduction to Martin Boghardt's Archäologie des gedruckten Buches (Wiesbaden, 2008): see Appendix for further details of this work. Martin Boghardt, of the most wide-ranging and creative bibliographers of the post-World War II era, died of cancer in Wolfenbüttel on 26 October 1998, just a month after his sixty-second birthday. 1 1. Obituaries: Horst Meyer, "Martin Boghardt in memoriam," Buchhandelsgeschichte 1998, no. 4: B207–208; Stephan Füssel, "Martin Boghardt—Bibliothekar und Buchforscher," Gutenberg-Jahrbuch 1999: 335–336. In the two years after the fatal illness was diagnosed, he faced it the way he had faced many of the difficulties of existence: with a reticent, stoical fatalism, combined with a stubborn determination to continue on his path of life and intel- lectual investigation, achieving what he could with the time and strength left to him. Even into the summer of that year he was hopeful of partici- pating in the Lyons-Villeurbanne colloquium of 16–21 November 1998, "Les trois révolutions de l'imprimerie." His topic was one he was uniquely qualified to discuss: "Printer's Manuals of the Pre-industrial Age: What They Reveal and What They Conceal" ("Der vorindustrielle Buchdruck in medialer Funktion: Was seine Lehrbücher beschreiben und was sie verschweigen"). A half-completed draft, with notes for a conclusion, survives. The last years were not a time of unhappiness, far from it. Martin (to refer to him temporarily in the terms of our own friendship) had many reasons for satisfaction. Within the world of book scholars his reputation increased steadily. This was due not to the quantity of his output—he had no desire to inflate his publication list—but to its uniformly high quality. He published only when he knew he had something useful to say, and when his work met his own standard: a more rigorous standard than any external editor could supply. More than this, his private life was happy, after years beset by periods of self-doubt and depression. With his third marriage, to Julie, he had found stability and a devoted supporter. And he was able to rebuild a close relationship with his son Thomas, from whom he had been long separated after the breakup of his second marriage. This was the great consolation of his later years; his pride in Thomas's academic achievements as an historian far surpassed the satisfaction he took in his own scholarly work. Martin Boghardt was born in Berlin on 26 September 1936, the mid- dle of three children, two boys and a girl, of Fritz Boghardt, a Lutheran- Evangelical minister, and of his wife Elisabeth. 2 2. I am grateful to Julie Boghardt for supplying significant information and documenta- tion, including the reminiscences of Elisabeth Boghardt, and for her constant encouragement. During the pre-war and most of the war years the family lived near and in Danzig, where Martin's schooling began; half a year was spent in Esslingen am Neckar, when his father was on service with the radar corps (Radarabwehr). At the end of the war the family succeeded in moving west—the mother and children by one arduous journey through a landscape of devastation, the father by another—from the Soviet to the English Sector. They were reunited in Hamburg, where the father found a pastoral position. Martin, aged ten and never strong in health, became seriously ill. Fritz Boghardt was helped to find more spacious and sanitary living quarters for his family by the aid of a sympathetic English officer whose favor he earned by re- citing Hamlet's "To be or not to be" soliloquy in English. The first stage of Martin's education was completed with his secondary school Abitur in 1955 in the classical curriculum, followed by his first visit, with a school friend, to Italy, a country and culture to which he became devoted. The road to bibliographical scholarship was slow and winding. Boghardt's university studies at Hamburg, Vienna, Munich, and Berlin were at first directed toward psychology and philosophy. Only in his fourth year, on his return to Hamburg, did he settle on German philology. He completed his Prüfungsarbeit in philosophy, under C. F. von Weizsäcker, in 1962: "The Theory of Knowledge Embodied in Plato's Allegory of the Cave" ( "Der erkenntnistheoretische Gehalt des Höhlengleichnisses" ). This was the year also of his marriage to Inge Brenner. Boghardt's "doctor- father" was the eminent Hölderlin scholar Adolf Beck. Beck was one of the advisers to the incipient new critical edition of Klopstock (Historisch- kritische Klopstockausgabe, 1974-). In 1966 Boghardt joined the project, where he met Christiane Dalhoff, who became his second wife. Their son, Thomas, was born in 1970. The following year Boghardt gained his doctorate with a dissertation on iambic trimeter in drama of the age of Goethe ( Der jambische Trimeter im Drama der Goethezeit , published in 1973). Boghardt's introduction to and rapid mastery of the methods of bib- liographical analysis, as formulated and exemplified by the so-called "Anglo-Saxon" school of A. W. Pollard (1859–1944), R. B. McKerrow (1872–1940), Sir Walter Greg (1875–1959), Fredson Bowers (1905–1991), and Charlton Hinman (1910–1977), did not come until he was in his thir- ties. He was already at work on the bibliography of Klopstock's writings which, in collaboration with his wife Christiane, was his chief responsibil- ity in the Klopstock editorial office. He was not one to reminisce in print; our only published information on this significant and transforming mo- ment comes from a brief statement in the unsigned, third-person-plural editorial introduction to the Klopstock bibliography: The editors owe special thanks to Professor Bernhard Fabian, professor of English at Münster and director of the Institutum Erasmianum, who brought to their atten- tion the Anglo-Saxon method of analytical bibliography. It must be acknowledged that our work on Klopstock editions was begun in ignorance of this long-established method of analysis, which, through Professor Fabian and several of his pupils, has required a change in our approach. 3 3. Christiane Boghardt, Martin Boghardt, and Rainer Schmidt, Die zeitgenössischen Drucke von Klopstocks Werken: Eine deskriptive Bibliographie (Berlin and New York, 1981), p. XIX: "Beson- deren Dank schulden [die Verfasser] Professor Bernhard Fabian, dem Münsteraner Anglisten und Direktor des Institutum Erasmianum, der sie auf die 'Analytische Bibliographie' der An- gelsachsen hingewiesen hat. Es sei nicht verschwiegen, daß die Arbeit an den Klopstockdrucken ohne die Kenntnis dieser längst etablierten Forschungsrichtung begonnen wurde und hier erst durch Professor Fabian und einige seiner Schüler ein Wandel veranlaßt worden ist." Whatever the precise form of Prof. Fabian's advice to the Klopstock project with regard to "Anglo-Saxon" methodology, there is no doubt that for Boghardt personally this marked a decisive intellectual turning point. Perhaps for the first time in his life his scholarly inclinations, pursued over many years in several disciplines, found a focus that drew into effective action all the facets of his distinctive talents and temperament. Boghardt was nothing if not a skeptic, instinctively resistant to all systems of belief that depend on an agreed dogma or that require allegiance to an unexam- ined authority. It must have been an attraction to him that bibliographical investigations—the best of them, that is—take nothing on faith, and pay no attention to the opinions of a socially constituted hierarchy. Verifiable evidence, and reasoning directly and explicitly tied to that evidence, are the only tools of the honest bibliographer. This was his standard. Perhaps out of diffidence, Boghardt's first bibliographical publication did not appear until 1971, the year he turned thirty-five. This article, a study of an early printing of Klopstock's Messias , was an offshoot of the larger Klopstock project, and was a collaboration with his wife, who pro- vided the impetus for its publication. 4 4. Christiane Boghardt and Martin Boghardt, "Die Halleschen Messias-Drucke von 1751/1752," 1971 (Appendix, no. 1). Although it was a first publication in this area for both authors, it is a fully mature study that, unobtrusively, gives a closely argued rationale for the fundamental importance of bib- liographical analysis. Klopstock's Messias is by its nature a potentially complicated example of textual transmission, for it was expanded and modified by the author over more than a half century, from the appearance of Gesänge I–III in the Bremer Beiträge of 1748 (Band 4, Stück 4–5) to the publication of Gesänge XVI-XX in 1773, and then on to the author's revisions and corrections for its inclusion in Göschen's 1799/1800 Leipzig edition of Klopstock's collected works. Christiane and Martin Boghardt's study, establishing and clarifying the textual relations of the Halle 1751/2 printings of Gesänge I–V, provides an exemplary demonstration of the unbreakable connection between bibliographical analysis and textual transmission. The authors showed that in 1751 the publisher Carl Hermann Hemmerde had Messias set in type three times, twice in octavo (creating two editions, not previ- ously distinguished) and once in quarto—Klopstock's preferred format as it allowed his long lines to be set without breaks. They showed moreover that the first octavo setting became the printer's copy for both the second octavo and the quarto setting. The establishment of this textual stemma was only the first part of their accomplishment. As the authors demonstrated, the stemmatics of textual transmission do not directly establish textual authority. They only establish the parameters within which textual authority can be, often imperfectly, expressed. Thus, in late December 1750 Klopstock sent to Hemmerde a list of textual changes to be incorporated in the new edi- tion. He used as his basis a copy of Hemmerde's 1749 octavo edition of Gesänge I–III. However, Klopstock himself was evidently unaware that Hemmerde had printed two superficially identical octavo editions dated 1749, what German bibliographers call Doppeldrucke. The first was set from the 1748 Bremer Beiträge . The second was copied from the first but with new errors. It was the second of these that Klopstock used to prepare the text for the 1751 Halle edition. 5 5. Boghardt analyzed the two 1749 editions in greater detail in "Der erste Einzeldruck von Klopstocks Messias: Zur Prioritätsbestimmung gleichdatierter Drucke," 1979 (Appendix, no. 6). One of the errors in the second 1749 edition, "in des Todesmeer" instead of the original "in des Todes Meer", went unnoticed, and so was passed onward into the 1751 Halle editions. When he subsequently prepared the text for the 1755 Copenhagen edition, Klopstock noticed the incorrect grammar of the corrupted phrase, but in- stead of returning to his original words as printed in the Bremer Beiträge , he modified the corruption, so that we are presented with three versions: … und geht in des Todes Meer unter. [1748 Bremer Beiträge &gt; 1749, 1st separate edition] … und geht in des Todesmeer unter. [1749, 2nd separate edition &gt; 1751/2 Halle] … geht dann ins Todesmeer unter. [1755 Copenhagen] The authors remark on the "exemplary significance" of this sequence: "a supposedly irrelevant printing can have its influence on the develop- ment of a text, when it is used as the basis for a revision" ("ein an sich ir- relevanter Druck kann auf die Entwicklung eines Textes einwirken, wenn er dessen Revision zugrunde gelegt wird"). In a closely similar way, an "original" compositor's error in one of Hemmerde's 1751/2 editions (that is, an error not present in the setting copy) was transmitted forward, with a contingent modification, into the 1755 Copenhagen edition of Messias by the agency of Klopstock him- self. For the text of Gesänge I–V Klopstock supplied to the publisher a marked copy of the Halle 1752 quarto edition. This edition contains in one line an erroneous setting, "schweigen" for "schwiegen". Klop- stock did not, however, restore the reading to "schwiegen", but instead similarly modified the verb of the parallel clause, from preterite to present tense: … allein sie sahen sie schlummern, und schwiegen [1748–9 Bremen] … allein sie sahen sie schlummern, und schweigen [1751/2 Halle] … allein sie sehen sie schlummern, und schweigen [1755 Copenhagen] The textual problems and complications raised by Doppeldrucke— reset editions that copy preceding editions so closely in type, format, lay- out and imprint as to be, in the absence of detailed inspection, essentially invisible—have had a long history of discussion. The American scholar William Kurrelmeyer (1874–1957) in particular, a pioneering figure vir- tually invisible to Anglo-American bibliographers, wrote extensively on Doppeldruck printings of Goethe, Wieland, and others. 6 6. William H. McClain, "William Kurrelmeyer: German American 1874–1957," The Report, A Journal of German-American History 37 (1978), 8–18; E. Albrecht, "Bibliography of William Kurrelmeyer," Modern Language Notes 68 (1953), 291–299. The first of Kurrelmeyer's many bibliographical investigations in this area was "Doppeldrucke von Schillers Jungfrau von Orleans," Modern Language Notes 25 (1910), 97–102, 131–137. The study by Christiane and Martin Boghardt stands out among these, nonetheless, for the thoroughness and subtlety of its investigation of the textual con- sequences of the phenomenon. Their work is exemplary in the literal sense: the careful reader will immediately realize, from these few closely- reasoned examples, that the same tools of analysis can be applied to all other texts as they move from one printed edition to another. To put it more positively: without research and analysis along these lines, the process of textual transmission through the medium of print cannot be effectively studied. In the next two years Boghardt published two more investigations within this theme, on the first printing of Goethe's "Faust-fragment," and on the concept of Doppeldruck. 7 7. "Zur Bestimmung des Erstdruckes von Goethes Faustfragment," 1972 (Appendix, no. 2); "Der Begriff des Doppeldruckes," 1973 (Appendix, no. 3). The study of the Faust-fragment is another model of analysis. Faust: Ein Fragment was first published in Leipzig in 1790, both as the first part of volume 7 of Cotta's octavo edi- tion of Goethe's Schriften and as a self-standing offprint (Sonderdruck, Einzelausgabe) with a title-page. It had long been recognized that copies both of Schriften volume 7 and of the Faust-fragment offprint divide into two distinct groups. The first five sheets A–E are of the same setting in both. Thereafter, in sheets F–K and half-sheet L, the groups divide into two different settings. A convenient earmark distinguishing them is that in one group, the last three lines of p. 144 (K8 V ) are set again at the top of p. 145 ( Li r ). These copies have conventionally been designated as S m and E m : i.e., Schriften / Einzelausgabe with (mit) the repeated lines, and the other group as S o and E o , where p. 145 is without (ohne) the repeated lines. There had been long discussions, often from the standpoint of the Goethe collector rather than the textual editor, on the relative priority of the two groups or editions, and arguments for each group had been advanced without definitive answer. The chief focus of the respective arguments, quite naturally, had been the textual differences between the two settings, of which the errone- ous repetition on p. 145 of the S m /E m group was the most conspicuous example. The beauty of Boghardt's approach was that he looked at the problem from an entirely fresh angle: not how the texts varied, but how, and consequently why, the two sets of copies were produced. He stud- ied closely the headlines or running titles of the two groups of copies. Very commonly, in printing shops from the fifteenth century onward, the headline settings were kept standing in the formes—with change only of what must be changed, such as page numbers—and so were carried over even as the text pages within the formes were replaced from one sheet to the next. Boghardt was able to determine that in sheets F and after, the S o /E o copies continued to use the same headlines as the common setting of sheets A–E, whereas the S m /E m copies have reset headlines in sheets F and after. This strongly reinforces, from independent data, the argument already made in 1932 by Ernst Schulte-Strathaus from certain textual variants: the S o /E o sheets were set in direct continuation of the com- mon setting of sheets A–E, and hence, like those sheets, were set directly from Goethe's manuscript. 8 8. Ernst Schulte-Strathaus, Die echten Ausgaben von Goethes Faust (Munich: Bremer Presse for Martin Bodmer, 1932), 85 copies printed; idem, Goethes Faust-Fragment 1790: Eine buchkundliche Untersuchung; Schriften der Corona, XXVI (Zurich and Munich, 1940). The S m /E m sheets represent a secondary and somewhat later setting, using as copy not Goethe's manuscript, but the S o /E o sheets. 9 9. Two secondary remarks may be useful. Boghardt's work was cited and discussed by Percy H. Muir, "Goethe Bibliography with Special Reference to Faust Ein Fragment 1790," The Book Collector 26.3 (1977), 342–352. Although he agreed with Boghardt's result, Muir seems not to have understood the details of the argument (he likewise failed to understand Schulte- Strathaus's arguments from the paper stocks). Muir missed entirely that the headline evidence was the core, and the original feature, of Boghardt's study. Misleadingly, he wrote (p. 347), "Boghardt takes the view first expressed by Kurrelmeyer that the more correct text should always be considered to be the earlier, a standpoint which appears to me to be dubious." It is significant that he did not support this by quoting Boghardt, who said no such thing. Muir had it backwards: Boghardt argued explicitly against treating this as a rule. In fact, for Kurrelmeyer too, this was not a rule, but rather a general presumption, always to be tested in specific cases. On the other hand, Boghardt suggested that the inner formes of the Faust-fragment sheets went to press first, and the outer formes second. My examination of the sequence of type impressions in two E o copies of the Faust-fragment convinces me that the outer formes were, at least for most sheets, printed first. Boghardt's Faust-fragment study underscores a point that even experi- enced historians sometimes overlook, and that bibliographers in particu- lar should always keep in mind. His conclusion, that the S o /E o copies of Faust: Ein Fragment had textual priority over the S m /E m copies, was not really a surprise in 1972. The arguments of Schulte-Strathaus for this sequence were strong ones—including a suggestive if non-definitive argu- ment from the respective paper stocks used in the two sets of copies—and were endorsed, for example, by Waltraud Hagen's Die Drucke von Goethes Werken (Berlin, 1971). The virtue—one could even say, the beauty—of Boghardt's analysis is that he brought to light compelling evidence from a hitherto entirely ignored production feature of the books. Because of this emphasis, he was able to resolve a generations-long question of tex- tual criticism without directly using evidence from the texts themselves. Only a scholar with an unusually creative mind could have approached the problem from this standpoint. We are reminded that an historical investigation (for bibliographical studies are always contributions to his- tory) need not overturn an accepted opinion to be worth publishing. It is equally useful to reinforce accepted opinions by means of new evidence and new reasoning. Boghardt spent the academic year 1973–1974 as library assistant at the Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenbüttel, and the following aca- demic year at the library school in Cologne (Bibliothekar-Lehrinstitut des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen). As his Prüfungsarbeit he produced a detailed survey of bibliographical method that, in revised form, was pub- lished by Hauswedell in 1977: Analytische Druckforschung: Ein methodischer Beitrag zu Buchkunde und Textkritik , dedicated to his young son. This brief monograph—its text can hardly extend beyond 20,000 words—is a clas- sic that remains still insufficiently known to English and American bibli- ographers. Following a survey chapter on Anglo-American and German contributions to bibliographical reasoning, Analytische Druckforschung pres- ents, with extensive, precise illustrations from relevant editions, a compre- hensive survey of the nature, causes, and characteristic forms of textual variation in movable-type printing, from in-press corrections and cor- ruptions to cancels to partial resettings to complete resettings. The result is considerably more than an "aposde's" application of Anglo-American methods to German printing. The fact is that the "Anglo-Saxon school" has never produced a manual giving so clear, methodical, and closely- reasoned an account and analysis of the many forms and stages of text variation that are intrinsic to the conditions of printing and publishing in the age of handset types. Although it earned favorable reviews in the two major English and American bibliographical journals and elsewhere—several reviewers lamented the absence of an index— Analytische Druckforschung seems to have had relatively little impact on the English-speaking world in the past quarter-century; as so often, the German language itself has been a bar- rier. An English reviewer appropriately characterized the book as "lucid and succinct," and an American reviewer concluded, perhaps a litde mis- leadingly, "no library … with extensive German holdings will want to be without it." 10 10. John L. Flood, review in The Library 5th ser. 33.3 (1978), 246–248; James E. Walsh, re- view in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 73.3 (1979), 380–383. Although Walsh's final sentence seemed to suggest that the interest of the monograph would be more or less limited to Germanists, he in fact recognized that its importance was much wider (p. 381): "[T]he critical method outlined by Boghardt for the collation, stemmatization, and evaluation of successive printed forms of a text has a validity not limited to any one country or century." In my own opinion, this book, with its preternaturally sharp focus, is an indispensable supplement to the canonical English-language manuals: R. B. McKerrow's An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Stu- dents (1927), Fredson Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), and Philip Gaskell's A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972). Even if he had published nothing after 1977, Analytische Druckforschung and a handful of shorter articles would still have earned for Boghardt permanent record in the annals of bibliographical analysis. After the completion of his Cologne studies, Boghardt returned to the Herzog August Bibliothek, first as a stipendiary, then as a permanent member of the staff, and there he spent the remainder of his profes- sional life. He did not rise high within the administration of the library, but the successive directors Paul Raabe and Helwig Schmidt-Glintzer recognized his unusual scholarly abilities, and he found steady support for his research projects. It should be noted that, as he himself was well aware, two earlier librarians at Wolfenbüttel had been pioneers in the physical description and analysis of printed books: Friedrich Adolf Ebert (1791–1834) and Gustav Milchsack (1850–1919). Milchsack's extensive unpublished notes on "Doppeldrucke" were an important resource for Boghardt's work on the same topic. 11 11. Cf. Analytische Druckforschung , pp. 15–17, "Analytische Druckforschung in Deutschland. The library's support of his research travels was especially critical, for he was always attracted to the most diffi- cult and complicated bibliographical problems, the solving of which typi- cally involved close examination of multiple copies, located in far-spread libraries. He was never satisfied to stop at the stage of a probable answer, when the investigation of more copies might move an explanation from plausibility to certainty or near-certainty. The most striking example of this was surely his study of the printing history of the first edition of Philip Melanchthon's Bedencken auffs Interim , 1548, a quarto book of four sheets or eight formes, which appeared with- out imprint. 12 12. "Der Zwitterdruck: Rationalisierung oder Komplikation der Textvermittlung? Darge- stellt an Philip Melanchthons Bedencken auffs Interim , 1548," 1994 (Appendix, no. 17). Boghardt made a forme-by-forme analysis based on the examination of 54 copies, and determined (to summarize rigorously a complex situation) that in the first issue, printed by Melchior Lotter in Magdeburg, six of the formes were set twice and another partially. In a second issue by Hans Lufft in Wittenberg, sheet A was fully reset (with a change of attribution from Melanchthon to "the theologians of Witten- berg"), and joined to Lotter's sheets B–D; the eight examined copies of that second issue represented three different forme-states of sheets B–D. German bibliographers traditionally referred to such cases of partial re- setting as "Zwitterdruck" or hybrid printing, a phrase inaugurated by Johannes Luther. 13 13. Johannes Luther, "Zwitterdrucke in der Reformationszeit," Zeitschrift für Bücherfreunde neue Folge 1 (1909), 109–114. But that phrase was never carefully defined and ex- emplified in satisfactory detail until Boghardt's study. In the 1980s, after the publication of the Klopstock bibliography, the scope of Boghardt's researches broadened considerably. In association with Frans A. Janssen (Amsterdam) and Walter Wilkes (Darmstadt), he ed- ited a series of high quality facsimiles of early German printer's manuals and Formatbücher (1983–1998), and wrote important introductions for five of them (see Appendix). This series has greatiy enriched our picture of the working world of the printing shops of the seventeenth and eigh- teenth centuries. Yet no one was more keenly aware than Boghardt that, however suggestive the narratives of printing-shop practice and prescrip- tion in these early manuals might be, they were not direct descriptions of invariable working methods. The manuals are significant secondary evi- dence, always to be controlled against what can be learned by close analy- sis of contemporary printing. This awareness explains the significance of the sub-clause in the title of Boghardt's uncompleted Lyons paper: "what [the typographic manuals] reveal and what they conceal." This also explains the structure of Boghardt's 1980 study of cancels and book format, a model demonstration of how much more clearly and vividly we can "see" printed books once we learn to look at them through the eyes of the printers who made them. 14 14. "Das Buchformat und seine Variationsmöglichkeiten: Zur Technik der Buchgestaltung im 18. Jahrhundert," 1980 (Appendix, no. 7). The central point is simple yet subtle: when cancel leaves were called for, printers often tried to fit them as nearly as possible into the existing structure of the edition, for example by imposing them in formes where there would otherwise be a blank leaf, or perhaps, quarter-sheet. Almost the entire study is devoted to showing that this "structural rationale" is exemplified by the cancels of a variety of eighteenth-century editions. Only in the last two pages—after estab- lishing that this rationale is explanatory for actual printing jobs—did Boghardt show, by quoting from the "Bericht an den Buchbinder" of Christian Gottiob Taubel's Praktisches Handbuch der Buchdruckerkunst für An- fänger (Leipzig, 1791), that the very language of the instructions, as drafted by an experienced printer (e.g.: "Die Vorstellung der Corrigir-Zeichen, welches ein halber Bogen ist , wird zu Seite 146 … gebunden" [italics sup- plied]), strongly supported his uncovering of this rationale. 15 15. Twenty years later, independently of Boghardt's work, virtually the same point was established with regard to one particular job carried out by the English novelist and printer Samuel Richardson: James E. May, "Interrelating the Cancellantia and Partial Gatherings in the First Edition of Edward Young's The Centaur not Fabulous," Studies in Bibliography 53 (2000 [2002]), 241–263. Perhaps even more significantly, in the early 1980s Boghardt's atten- tion began to be drawn back to the earliest period of European printing. Already in Analytische Druckforschung he had shown his awareness that the principles of analysis must be true, mutatis mutandis, for movable-type printing from all periods (see especially 78 sq., "Der Doppelblattkarton"). This contrasts favorably with the major trend of "Anglo-Saxon" bibli- ography, whose tendency has been to leave aside the study of fifteenth- century printing as a field to itself, in at least partial exile from the central matter of the bibliographer's concerns. At this relatively early stage of his researches, however, Boghardt's involvement with fifteenth-century printing was only peripheral. What comes across most clearly in his remarks is a certain frustration with the lack of clarity and internal consistency to be found, and still to be found, in many bibliographical descriptions of incunables, even in such standard works as the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke (GW). Thus, he was dissatis- fied (footnote 37) with the account of GW 6555, the 30-line Indulgence (Mainz, 1455), where in-press variants represented by different copies or sets of copies are described as indicating six different editions ("sechs verschiedene … Ausgaben"). He criticized also GW 6688's account of the three reset sheets found in quire K of some copies of the Cologne Chronicle ( Cronica van der hilliger stat van Coellen , Cologne: Johann Koelhoff the younger, 23 Aug. 1499, Goff C–476) . As he noted, if a description identifies an earlier and a later state, whether of cancel leaves or sheets, or of in-press corrections, the evidence for which is earlier and which is later must be given, "and GW says nothing about this" ("und darüber findet sich im GW für die Kölner Chronik nichts"). 16 16. Analytische Druckforschung , pp. 79 and 155 (note 37). As it happens, GW's identification of the first and second settings of these sheets, K.3.8, 4.7, and 5.6, is backwards. In the first setting, these sheets are signed with majuscule K, as in sheets K1–2 and the text types are the same as K1–2. In the rarer second setting, the sheets are signed with minuscule k, and the typographic layout of the text varies from that of sheets K1–2. When Boghardt next turned his attention to incunabula, it was to en- counter a much more challenging problem, that presented by the Mainz 1460 edition of the Catholicon of Johannes Balbus (GW 3182). The paper copies of this edition divide into three distinct groups, according to their paper stocks. Researches into these stocks by Theo Gerardy, and then by Eva Ziesche and Dierk Schnitger, showed convincingly that the three sets of papers were manufactured and marketed at different times over more than a decade, from c. 1459–60 to c. 1472–3. Only one set of paper, with Bull's Head watermark, could have existed in 1460, and associated with this set by its identical pinhole pattern is the issue printed on vellum. Another set, with watermark of the Galliziani family, Basel papermakers, probably came to market in 1469. The third set, with paper from two mills, one using a Crown watermark and the other a Tower watermark, probably came to market in 1472. I became interested in the problem of the date of the "1460" Catholi- con , and in 1982 published an article which reconciled the evidence as then known, and extended it, to arrive at a new explanation of the seem- ing paradox. By my argument, there were three separate but (with very small exceptions) textually identical printings of the Catholicon: one in 1460 on Bull's Head paper (plus all vellum copies), one in 1469 on Gal- liziani paper, and one in 1472/3 on a mixture of Tower and Crown paper. These printings were textually identical not because a massive quantity of type, sufficient for more than 700 Royal folio pages of 132 column-lines per page, was kept standing, undamaged, for a dozen or more years. The textual identity was owing, rather, to the fact that the type-pages con- sisted not of movable types, but rather of thin castings of two successive column-lines each. These castings were apparently disassembled after the first printing, and stored page-by-page; and then were reassembled twice more, for the second and third printings. 17 17. "Johann Gutenberg and the Catholicon Press," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 76.4 (1982), 395–456. Two brief Chancery quarto tracts from the Catholicon shop (probably Johann Gutenberg's shop) were printed by the same technique, with first impressions of their two-line castings made c. 1459–60, and second impressions made c. 1469. Nine months after my publication appeared, I received a letter from Boghardt, who had in the meantime examined copies of the Catholicon in a dozen libraries, going as far afield as Vienna, Milan, Parma, Rome, and Naples (fig. 1). He had noted that fo. 169, the fifth leaf of the eighteenth quire, was a cancel in all the copies he had seen of the Tower-Crown impression, and was hopeful of finding a copy with an uncancelled leaf, to discover the reason for cancellation. In subsequent correspondence we agreed that the evidence of the cancels could provide a crucial test of my hypothesis. In the typical case of a type-printed book—as Boghardt knew more thoroughly and comprehensively than anyone—a cancel leaf, if one were present in one or more copies, would be of a different setting, both recto and verso, from the leaf it replaced, the so-called cancellandum. This was naturally the case, for cancels generally represent a late stage of correction or emendation. By the time they are created, the type-pages that contained the settings of the cancellandum leaf would have been bro- ken up and distributed back to the type-case. Except in unusual instances where the relevant formes remained intact, complete resetting is the only way to create a cancel (cancellans) leaf. 18 18. Analytische Druckforschung , p. 84: "Der Einblattkarton ist ein meist auf Neusatz beruhendes Ersatzblatt, das anstelle eines zu tilgenden Blattes eingeklebt wird." Ibid., pp. 92– 97, illustrates several rare examples, in copies of Klopstock's Oden (Hamburg, 1771, 4°), his Die deutsche Gelehrtenrepublik (Hamburg, 1774, 8°), and Goethe's Schriften , Bd. 3 (Leipzig, 1787/1790, 8°) where the cancellandum and cancellans leaves are the same setting, except for in-press corrections made in the cancellans. Martin discussed and reproduced one more example in "Der Buchdruck und das Prinzip des typographischen Kreislaufs: Modell einer Erfindung," 1990 (Appendix, no. 14), fig. [19], from his own copy of Eduard Mörike, Gedichte (Stuttgart and Tübingen, 1838), which retains both the cancellanda and the cancels. By my hypothesis of the production of the 1460 Catholicon , cancels could not behave in the usual way. If they did, I would have to "cancel" my explanation. Instead, as Boghardt and I agreed, the Catholicon's can- cels, still unexplored, would have to be identical on both recto and verso with their respective cancellanda, except where some textual correction was made. But if a textual correction were made, even of a single letter, it would of necessity be "embedded" in a complete resetting of the two-line pair containing that letter. We both began to investigate the cancels, he much more thoroughly than I. 19 19. At the time of this first correspondence, September 1983, Boghardt had examined four copies of the second impression of die Catholicon (Galliziani) and eight of the third (Tower- Crown), but had not seen a copy of the first impression. I had seen three copies of the first (Bull's Head-vellum) impression, two on paper and one on vellum, but only relatively briefly. In my reply to Boghardt I wrote, "There are cancel leaves in the Bull's Head = vellum im- pression … but … I still don't have an adequate list of exactly how many leaves, and which leaves … were cancelled." Eventually Boghardt examined person- FIGURE 1.

No uncancelled state of Tower-Grown fo. 169 has, by the way, come to light, although there remain some copies, including five in Poland, that have not been closely examined. The result of the investigations was in conformity with what my expla- nation absolutely required. For the three leaves of the Bull's Head-vellum impression where a difference appears between the cancellandum and the cancellans, the settings are identical on both recto and verso, except at the places of correction; and all three corrections involved pairs of lines. In two of these cases, pairs of lines were imposed in the wrong textual order in the cancellandum, and reimposed in correct order in the cancellans. In the third case, the most indicative of all, an incorrect word in one line necessitated not just the replacement of that word, but the resetting of all of both lines of the pair. That is to say, the entire two lines were reset in type, and then from those types a new line-pair—a "slug," to borrow the vocabulary of the Linotype process—was cast. 20 20.

Boghardt's first publication on the Mainz Catholicon inaugurated a major reorientation in his research in the last ten years of his life. It was followed by a series of important and original studies on the earli- est years of printing, with special emphasis on cancels and other sources of textual variation. His last published work, appearing posthumously, represents yet another major initiative in the field of early printing, a long-overdue extensive summary of the pinhole patterns in early large format incunables. This topic had been almost entirely ignored in the generations since Gustav Milchsack and, especially, Paul Schwenke laid the first groundwork for deriving evidence from the varying placements of the pins by which sheets were held in position on frames as they went under the printing press. 21 21. "Punkturmuster in großformatigen Inkunabeln und die Datierung des Mainzer Catholicon," 1999 (Appendix, no. 25). This study, based on a lecture given at the Gutenberg- Museum in Mainz, 20 June 1997, was uncompleted at Boghardt's death. He did not have time to verify and revise some of the information on imprints and dates of the incunable editions, nor to prepare the footnotes that he would have considered indispensable. Nonetheless, it presents an extensive survey of, and makes valuable comments on, varying pinhole patterns in about 75 early Royal and Imperial folio editions from Mainz, Strassburg, Bamberg, Augsburg, and Nuremberg. A reduced English version, assembled and translated by John Flood, was published in The Library 7th ser. 1.3 (2000), 263–289, as "Pinhole Patterns in Large-Format Incunabula." This version, well-intentioned though it was, cannot be looked on as an authen- tic publication by Boghardt, who played no part in it. Flood purposely omitted the central focus of Boghardt's study, the varying pinhole patterns of the three impressions of the Mainz Catholicon , stating that he had made the text "more suitable for an audience less familiar with the minutiae of the prolonged and sometimes fraught debate over the printing of the Mainz Catholicon …." In 1991 Martin Boghardt, with the encouragement of the then di- rector of the Herzog August Bibliothek, Paul Raabe, planned a single volume selection of his most significant bibliographical studies (published posthumously: see Appendix). He presented a detailed oudine to Raabe in September of that year, under the suggested title Archäologie des gedruck- ten Buches , The Archaeology of the Printed Book. The outline provides interesting clues on how Boghardt looked at the corpus of his work. He was conscious that it could be organized under a small number of inter- related themes that may be seen as defining a unique scholarly rationale, or aesthetic. The layout of this planned volume was in essence a per- sonal answer, as of 1991, to a question that has been posed as, "Why do scholars produce what they produce?" 22 22. John Barrie Hall, "Jacobus van Wageningen, Manilius, and Housman," in Latin Studies in Groningen 1877–1977 , ed. Heinz Hofmann (Groningen, 1990), pp. 57–72 (p. 61). Boghardt's scholarly aesthetic may be brought out by considering three terms, each of which was of his own making: Printing Analysis (Analytische Druckforschung), The Typo- graphic Cycle (Der typographische Kreislauf), and the title of his collec- tion, Archaeology of the Printed Book. Printing Analysis ( Analytische Druckforschung ). The 1977 monograph of this title begins with a section headed "'Critical / Analytical Bibliog- raphy' in England und den USA." In its first sentence, Boghardt wrote that these English expressions are best rendered in German as "analyt- ische Druckforschung": "a special branch of book study … that one can best express in German as analytische Druckforschung" ("eine besondere Richtung der Buchkunde … die man im Deutschen am ehesten als ana- lytische Druckforschung bezeichnen kann"). Dr. Horst Meyer's obituary (note 1 above) presents a vivid explanation of why Boghardt did not sim- ply make the direct and obvious translation, "analytische Bibliographie." The "highly conservative examiners" ("überaus konservative Prüfer") of the Bibliothekar-Lehrinstitut in Cologne insisted on the change, for the vocabulary of librarianship already used "analytische Bibliographie" to mean the itemized listing of articles in periodicals, festschriften, and other collections. The story is true and has its amusement, but there is more to say. This is not simply a fable, with unambiguous moral, of the reincarnation of the viri obscuri of Cologne. "Analytische Druckforschung" and its shorter form "Druckanalyse" are Boghardt's own terms, and he was happy to use them. They have become standard in German; he himself contributed the entry "Analytische Druckforschung" to the Lexikon des gesamten Buchwesen s, 2. Ausgabe (LGB 2 ; Stuttgart, 1987-). Now, a quarter-century after the terms were coined, we can see that, or at least argue that, they give a more precise description of this discipline than does the Anglo-American "analytical bibliography." The central virtue of Boghardt's expression is that it omits the word bibliography / Bibliographie , whose range of meanings in ordinary discourse is so broad that it cannot, standing alone, convey any particular special- ized sense. Thus, the Oxford English Dictionary's central definitions for bibliography are "The systematic description and history of books, their au- thorship, printing, publication, editions, etc.," and "A list of the books of a particular author, printer, or country, or of those dealing with any partic- ular theme; the literature of a subject": it is as if the meaning of the word oscillates between two poles. As G. Thomas Tanselle has stated, "bibliog- raphy is not 'a subject' but a related group of subjects that happen to be commonly referred to by the same term." 23 23. G. Thomas Tanselle, "Science and Bibliography," Studies in Bibliography 27 (1974), 55–89 (p. 87). In the Anglo-American world, attempts to narrow and refine the exceptionally broad scope of the word bibliography to more circumscribed meanings have chiefly taken the form of a liberal recourse to adjectival qualifiers. In the writings of Greg, Bowers, McKenzie, and others we can find references to critical / analytical / pure / pure analytical / enumerative / systematic / descriptive / textual / his- torical / physical bibliography; and the list may not be exhaustive. Surely this is a superfluity of adjectives. Few of us are capable of, or have a desire of, keeping such a multiplicity of supposed categories and implied hier- archies distinct from one another. Nor is the utility of doing so apparent. Boghardt made a simpler division of "analytische Druckforschung" into three stages: bibliographische Erfassung (roughly, descriptive bibli- ography), bibliogenetische Erklärung (analysis proper), and textbezogene Deutung (roughly, textual bibliography). He pointed out that only the first of these is objective in the sense of being independently verifiable. The other two stages, depending on the first for their evidence, are in their nature probabilistic ("Analytische Druckforschung," LGB 2 1.85). Partly because the word bibliography is set aside, "analytische Druckforschung" describes precisely a rigorously simple concept: the analysis of printing. It does not pretend to cover every conceivable form of bibliographical research, or to establish for itself any fixed place in a supposed hierarchy of levels of scholarship—flaws that reside in many of the "Anglo-Saxon" discussions of bibliography. Explicitly for Boghardt, "Druckanalyse," like many other sup- posedly specialized areas of "auxiliary science," could be seen, depending on the goals of the particular investigations, as equally a Hilfswissenschaft and a Grundwissenschaft. 24 24. "Die Erforschung des Buchdrucks als Grund- und Hilfswissenschaft," 1995 (Appendix, no. 16), p. 5: "Indessen räume ich gerne ein … daß die historischen Wissenschaften, die man zu recht auch Grundwissenschaften genannt hat, keineswegs reine Fakten- und Datenhuberei sind. …" This may be compared with Ludwig Traube's introductory remark in his Munich lectures, 1902–1905: "Was bei allen Universitätsfächern der Fall ist, trifft im höchsten Grade bei der lateinische Philologie des Mittelalters zu. Sie besteht für sich allein, sie kann die Kraft eines einzelnen voll in Anspruch nehmen. … Aber zugleich ist sie Hilfswissenschaft—und vielfach unentbehrliche—für den, der ganz sich andern Fächern hingibt" ( Einleitung in die lateinischen Philologie des Mittelalters , ed. Paul Lehmann; Ludwig Traube, Vorlesungen und Ab- handlungen … zweiter Band [Munich: C. H. Beck, 1911], p. 2). Moreover, in consequence of the omission of the word bibliography , this definition of "analytische Druckforschung" neither states nor implies that bibliographical analysis in general is con- fined to, or finds its central function in, the study of printed materials. It is the formulation of an exceptionally clear-minded pragmatist. The Typographic Cycle ( Der typographische Kreislauf ). Boghardt considered the concept of the "typographische Kreislauf," which he first formulated in 1985 and expanded on in 1990, to be the leitmotiv of all his researches; and so he intended it to occupy the first and introductory place within his planned collection. 25 25. "Der Buchdruck als Überlieferungsträger," 1985 (Appendix, no. 9), pp. 5–6; enlarged in "Der Buchdruck und das Prinzip des typographischen Kreislaufs: Modell einer Erfindung," 1990 (Appendix, no. 14). This is the guiding concept for all analysis of printing with movable types. It involves the study, in all phases, of the "progres- sion from forme to forme of setting, printing, distribution, and further setting, through the use of a limited supply of types" ("von Druckform zu Druckform voranschreitende Abfolge von Setzen, Drucken, Ablegen und weiterem Setzen mit Hilfe eines … begrenzten Letternvorrats"). 26 26. From Boghardt's draft introduction to his planned collected papers, September 1991. In my mind, this is at once the most concisely expressed and the most fruitful model for thinking about typographic printing that has so far been formulated. Virtually every complication and situation one encounters in studying printed artifacts—in-press corrections, cancels, damaged types, headline changes, and so on—can be clarified, organized and unified by asking the question: "Where do these particular phenomena lie within the typographic cycle?" It is perhaps useful to think of the bibliographer's central or ideal task to be that of attempting to visualize and reconstruct the full typographic cycle of printing jobs. Ever since reading Boghardt's article, I have consciously tried to think and speak about types not as (pas- sively) "movable types" but rather as (actively) "recycling types": types that are, or historically were, in movement, by the agency of human hands and by unintended accidents, within a defined cycle, beginning and ending at typecases. Boghardt's 1990 exposition of the typographic cycle was both an ex- pansion and a compression of his 1977 Analytische Druckforschung . It was an expansion in two ways. First, he took into account, under the rubric of "Delaying Factors" ("Retardierende Momente"), the initial correction phase(s) (Grundkorrektur) of the printing process: a stage of production that he had intentionally left out of discussion in his 1977 monograph. Second, he also took into account, under the rubric "New Printing with- out New Setting?" ("Neudruck ohne Neusatz?"), the question of how the three books of the Mainz Catholicon Press were printed. It might be said that the challenge or problem of the Catholicon Press books under Boghardt's eye was that they seemed not to fit the expectations of the typographic cycle; and the solution of the problem could only be found by concluding that the books were not, therefore, directly printed from recycling types. So simple and simplifying a concept as that of the typographic cycle could perhaps only have been formulated by someone with deep experi- ence in investigating some of the most challenging cases for bibliographi- cal investigation: German printing in the grand age of "Doppeldruck" and "Zwitterdruck," where what will look to most eyes like two copies of the same book may not only be different—they may not even be two copies of the same edition; where three superficially identical copies may represent one or two or three editions; and where the several editions, once diagnosed, will still contain no obvious clues to their relative priority. For many years, Boghardt's chief tool in these investigations was the Hin- man Collator, but in later years he became interested in the possibilities of using computer software to make "virtual" superimpositions of cor- responding pages or passages of different copies. Five such color-printed superimpositions were reproduced in his 1990 article, to illustrate a cen- tral point of the concept of the typographic cycle: for the bibliographer, as for Torah students over many centuries, not only does every word have meaning, but so does every letter; not only every letter, but also every space between letters. But the bibliographer's belief is predicated on something simpler than reverence for the text. It is a consequence of the fact that every space on a type-printed page is a blank reflection of a physical object: a non-printing type that, like the inked types, lies within the typographic cycle. The Archaeology of the Printed Book ( Archäologie des gedruckten Buche ) . Boghardt did not provide a detailed argument of why his bibliographical investigations—and by extension, those of others—can usefully be de- scribed as an "archaeology of the printed book," or of why he chose this as the title for his projected collection. There is only a brief statement in the 1991 draft of his introduction: Printing analysis concerns itself with the printed book as a material object produced by a combination of hand and mechanical processes, and investigates how it came into being by means of its physical form, It is a search for clues, an archaeology of the printed book. 27 27. "Die analytische Druckforschung beschäftigt sich mit dem gedruckten Buch als einem materiellen, handwerklich-technischen Produkt und untersucht dessen Entstehungsweise an- hand seines Erscheinungsbildes. Sie ist eine Indizienforschung, eine Archäologie des gedruck- ten Buches." He used the same sentences in "Druckanalyse und Druckbestimmung," 1995 (Appendix, no. 20), p. 202, an article based on a talk he gave in late November 1991, at the tenth annual meeting of the Wolfenbütteier Arbeitskreis für Geschichte des Buchwesens. He did not explain or justify his choice of that term any further here, nor apparently in his published articles to that date, but we may feel confident that the expression had a precise significance for him, for he never wrote carelessly. It is noteworthy, and perhaps directly relevant, that in the post-World War II years, various manuscript scholars—most notably François Masai (1909–1979), L. M. J. Delaissé (1914–1972), and G. I. Lieftinck (1902– 1994)—argued that the totality of interconnected ways of studying and extracting evidence from medieval manuscripts was not adequately re- vealed by the traditional term palaeography, and would fit better under the broader rubric, "archaeology of the medieval book." This viewpoint is reflected in the title of Delaissé's classic study of Thomas à Kempis's autograph of De imitatione Christi: it was an "archaeological examina- tion." 28 28. Le manuscrit autographe de Thomas a Kempis et "l'Imitation de Jésus-Christ." Examen ar- chéologique et édition diplomatique du Bruxellensis 5853–61 , 2 vols. (Antwerp, 1956). No clear consensus has emerged from the resulting discussions. Arguments have been published in favor of the expression; in favor of using the word codicology to cover the many aspects of book study that move beyond what the word palaeography strictly implies; and in favor of keeping the word palaeography , but with the understanding that it must be interpreted broadly, to encompass every facet of manuscript study. 29 29. A convenient collection of discussions of the topic is to be found in Codicologica I: Théories et principes, ed. Albert Gruys and J. P. Gumbert (Leiden, 1976); it includes relevant studies by Gruys, Masai, Albert Derolez, T. J. Brown, and Delaissé. See also Wolfgang Milde, "Spezielle Handschriftenkunde," in Karl Löffler, Einjührung in die Handschriftenkunde , neu bear- beitet von Wolfgang Milde (Stuttgart, 1997) , pp. 19–25. These discussions have been more or less the reverse of the discussions among students of printed books about how many subdivisions should be made of the word bibliography: palaeography seemed to be too narrow a word, bibliography too broad. Whatever the specific terms scholars prefer for naming the discipline(s) that study medieval books, it cannot be wrong to call this, or them, an "archaeology of the medieval book," for all artifacts have an archaeologi- cal aspect. Given a book or a group of books, we may inquire into their physical materials and how and where they were made; into their physical structure, and how the text and other graphic markings fit into that struc- ture; into how and where the book was made; into the binding (or suc- cession of bindings) that complete its structure; and into the history of its movements from its beginnings and eventual completion into the present. All such questions and tools for answering them constitute an archaeo- logical investigation. Our goal is to try to reconstruct and understand the totality of human activities that went into creating the object at hand, us- ing it, and transmitting it from its time and place of making to its current time and place. To speak of an archaeology of the book is not to create a heuristic simile, such as Henry Bradshaw's "natural history" method: it is merely to recognize that books are physical, manufactured objects. Once we admit that there is an archaeology of the medieval book—that the expression, whether we favor it or not, has meaning—we must accept that there is equally an archaeology of the printed book. On the one hand, incunables must be seen as included under the umbrella of "medieval books"; on the other hand, none of the questions we ask of incunables stop being askable or interesting when 1501, or any other date, is reached. This is self-evident, but it seems, nonetheless, that Boghardt was the first scholar to refer explicitly to an archaeology of the printed book. His expression is in symmetry with, and a natural outgrowth of, the discus- sions of medieval palaeographers, but there is no evidence that he was deeply influenced by those discussions, which he never cited. My own suspicion is that he was chiefly led to this expression from a rather differ- ent direction, guided by the experience of his own long years of research. The fourth division of the 1991 arrangement of his studies is headed "Relative Chronologie"; within it he placed three studies of groups of printed editions whose priorities and sequences of manufacture are not, prima facie, clear. On closer examination, as he demonstrated, their re- lationships and sequences can be reliably determined. We might say that each edition can be located within a defined archaeological stratum, later perhaps than some other edition, earlier than yet another. Moreover, the very concept of the typographic cycle implies that it is fruitful to try to recognize the many subtle, nearly invisible strata that subsist within a printed book—that is, within individual copies of a printed edition. A printed book does not come into being as a single event, but as a multitu- dinous series of events, not uncommonly stretching over weeks, months, and even years. The archaeologist's skill lies, and Boghardt's skill lay, in recognizing and understanding the small clues that reflect the passage of time resident in the objects at hand. It should not go unsaid that Martin Boghardt followed a strict per- sonal code of scholarly ethics in all his publications. Some things he would always do: investigate, give credit to, and fairly judge the existing litera- ture on the questions he took up. Others he would never do: advertise the importance of his own work, artificially set himself up to advantage against other scholars, prefer a clever phrase to an accurate one. He had no desire for quarrels, but was firm in defending his own reasoning, and his right to express his judgments. Some years ago, a brief encyclopedia notice Boghardt had been asked to write on the Mainz Catholicon was anonymously modified by the editor, who was dissatisfied with its conclu- sion. He changed Boghardt's wording at several places without consulta- tion, and cut the conclusion, which accepted that the Catholicon had been printed from paired-line castings. When Boghardt protested, the editor replied that Boghardt had been inappropriately dogmatic ("apodiktisch") in stating his opinion so positively; and that the changes had been made to protect Boghardt's reputation. To this Boghardt responded that the editor had the right to add his own views, but not under Boghardt's name. I have sometimes wondered whether the editor ever understood the full implica- tions of that remark, and the chasm it exposed between their respective views of scholarly ethics. 30 30. For Martin's public statement on this episode see "Die bibliographische Erforschung der ersten Catholicon-Ausgabe(n)," 1988 (Appendix, no. 13), note 33. Typically, Martin wrote of the errors of others with oblique irony rather than with indignation. In his study of Lessing's Minna von Barn- helm (Appendix, no. 4), he began by quoting a recent scholar who had declared that the edition by Karl Lachmann and Franz Muncker (1886) had laid out the textual evidence so thoroughly that there was simply nothing more to be done in that line: "It would be a waste of energy to set into motion the entire process of textual criticism all over again, and by an identical method arrive once more at the identical results" ("Es wäre ein falscher Kraftaufwand, den ganzen textkritischen Prozeß noch einmal in Bewegung zu setzen, um mit der gleichen Methode zu den glei- chen Resultaten zu kommen"). At the end of his study and well removed from this quotationS—which he did not recall to the reader's attention— Boghardt summarized the textual sources of that 1886 edition: "The text portion of the Minna critical edition follows, at the end, a reprint; in the main portion a reprint of a reprint; and at the beginning, no less than a reprint of a reprint of a reprint" ("Der Textteil der kritischen Minna- Ausgabe … folgt … am Schluß … einem Nachdruck, im umfangreichen Hauptteil … dem Nachdruck eines Nachdrucks und am Anfang sogar dem Nachdruck des Nachdrucks eines Nachdrucks"). Boghardt was a skeptic to the core but, one may say, an optimistic skeptic. His capacity for doubt was in perfect balance with a strong fides bibliographica: a belief in the powerful results that can, although without guarantee, be obtained by combining extensive, controlled observations with repeated rounds of careful reasoning. Regardless of the result, the effort was worth making. Words written two generations ago in com- memoration of the Benedictine scholar Dom Donatien De Bruyne apply equally to the agnostic Martin Boghardt: Travailler sans relâche; mourir sans gloire … ces mots résument sa carriÉre sci- entifique, faite d'un labeur acharné et d'une modestie insouciante des honneurs humains. 31 31.

VERSES IN SERMONS AGAIN: THE CASE OF CAMBRIDGE, JESUS COLLEGE, MS QA.13 by Ralph Hanna Even ninety years after the fact, Carleton Brown's contributions to the study of the early English lyric remain monumental. Not only did he produce the only attempts at comprehensive, historically conceived editions of many texts (primarily short religious verse), but through his extensive bibliographical efforts he largely set the agenda followed by all subsequent scholarship. Whatever the limitations I will discuss below, his immense investment in the manuscript record of short verse and in its presentation to the scholarly community in organised form cannot be faulted. Brown's great monument, actually the second of his major bibliographi- cal contributions, is Index of Middle English Verse , which appeared in 1943. Co- authored with Rossell H. Robbins, at the time a Cambridge graduate, it was the culmination of a quarter century of work. 1 1. See Carleton Brown, Register of Middle English Didactic and Religious Verse , 2 vols (Oxford, 1916–20), most relevantly for my purposes 1:212; and, with Rossell H. Robbins, Index of Middle English Verse (New York, 1943) (hereafter Index) . Brown had begun surveying verse in manuscripts before the first World War—at a time when large numbers of texts were known only 'accidentally', on the basis of their presentation in print from a single copy. Moreover, in the absence of comprehensive modern catalogues and indexes, knowledge of library collections was equally haphazard. In this context, Brown went about the task of finding Middle English texts with considerable rigour. He did not try to survey everything but generally lim- ited himself to manuscripts he believed would include English. But within these limits, he made reasonably scrupulous folio-by-folio surveys of numerous selected books. Further, he relied on similar surveys from correspondents he believed trustworthy (e.g. Col. R. B. Haselden, curator of manuscripts at the Hunting- ton Library) for information about collections he could not visit personally. His exemplary manuscript bibliography, however partial its survey, performed an extremely useful service by demonstrating, most particularly to North American scholars who lacked continuous access to the British archive, precisely where verse of all sorts might be found. One of Brown's greatest supports in his search for verse was provided by past manuscript cataloguers. Preeminent here was the greatest manuscript scholar of the early twentieth century, M. R. James, who had carefully described nearly all the manuscripts in Cambridge college libraries in a series of magisterial cata- logues. As James saw, in a customarily informative description, Cambridge, Jesus College, MS Q.A.13 (his MS 13) is a composite manuscript of sermons, at least portions of Franciscan origin. 2 2. A Descriptive Catalogue of the Manuscripts in the Library of Jesus College, Cambridge (London, 1895), 11–12. I am grateful for the generosity of Frances Willmoth, Jesus's librarian, for op- portunities to inspect the manuscript and for supplying reproductions. Latter parts of the book are joined by a medieval foliation (not replaced by any modern one). This begins at modern fol. 60, and one set of Latin sermons in double columns, copied in the second half of the fourteenth century, ends on medieval fol. 33 v fol. 91 v in the continuous modern foliation (which shortly ceases). This is succeeded by a set of sermons in long lines, written in what an English palaeographer would describe as a secretary bookhand of the mid fifteenth century; these sermons cover the medieval fo- lios 34–149 v , with folios 149 v –157 v (the end of the manuscript) a table of topics treated in them. The volume's second, fifteenth-century set of sermons may well represent a collection from diverse sources. But within this section of the book, James noted English bits on folios containing a consecutive block of three sermons: 1. Fols 79 v –83 v : 'Ingredere ciuitatem Actuum 9[:6] et in epistola hodierna Reuerendi mei dicit Egidius De regimine…', for inclaustrating a recluse; 2. Fols 83 v –90 v : 'Quid fecit quare morietur, primo Regum 2o[:cf. 32] Wat hath ye man do yat he schal dy3e 300 [ l . þ00] Karissimi narrat Augustinus 10 o . De ciuitate dei capitulo 19….', for Good Friday; 3. Fols 90 v –94 v : 'Tv es qui venturas es Matthei 11 [:3] Karissimi Virgilius 6 o . Eneidorum docet quod tria principaliter requiruntur in rege…', for (?the first Sunday in) Advent? As is customary in books of this sort, the English, which inspection proves to be rhymed verse, has been written consecutively within the Latin prose of the sermons. Within these sermons, the scribe copies seven separate sets of verses. Follow- ing James's notice, Brown surveyed the manuscript; as will emerge, this study did not form one of the triumphs of his indexing. Following his notice, several of the poems have been printed (although most usually from another source). The ma- gister macaronicorum , Siegfried Wenzel, has published two items Brown overlooked completely and has discussed the manuscript helpfully on several occasions. On the basis of such published notice, the Edinburgh linguistic atlas briefly refers to the book as containing 'East Anglian (? Suffolk)' English. 3 3. For the indication of dialect, see Angus McIntosh, M. L. Samuels, et al., A Linguis- tic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English , 4 vols (Aberdeen, 1986), 1:63 (hereafter LALME). For Wenzel's various discussions, see Verses in Sermons: Fasciculus morum and its Middle English Poems (Cambridge MA, 1978), 90–93 (and the instructive discussion of a sermon from Worcester Cathedral, MS F.126 at 82–86); Macaronic Sermons: Bilingualism and Preaching in Late-Medieval England (Ann Arbor, 1994), perhaps most pregnantly 24–25; and most exten- sively, Preachers, Poets, and the Early English Lyric (Princeton, 1986), 87, 91, 118–119, 153–156, 158, 234. In manuscript order, Jesus MS 13 contains the following English verse: (a) fol. 83: a seven-line lyric, ignored in Brown's Index and first published by Wenzel, with errors, Anglia 92 (1974), 74–75 (no. 79), and in a corrected version, Preachers , 228–229. (b) scattered among the Latin, fols 85–86 v : Index 2240, ed. from National Li- brary of Scotland, MS Advocates' 18.7.21, Carleton Brown, Religious Lyrics of the XIVth Century (Oxford, 1924), 88–89, 268nn. (c) scattered among the Latin, fols 86 v –87: Index 4185, ed. from Cambridge Uni- versity Library, MS Ff.v.48, Henry A. Person, Cambridge Middle English Lyrics (Seattle WA, 1953, 1962), 10–11; and R. T. Davies, Medieval English Lyrics: A Critical Anthology (London, 1963), 207–208. (d) fol. 87: Index 1307; Brown, ed., Register , 1:212. (e) fol. 89, a pair of couplets, ignored in Brown's Index ; Wenzel, ed., Preachers , 154 and n. (f) fol. 90: Index 2074, ed. from British Library, MS Harley 7322, Frederick J. Furnivall, Political, Religious, and Love Poems , Early English Text Society 15 (1866), 235. (g) scattered among the Latin, fols 92 v –93 v : reported by Brown as Index 3210 on fol. 92, described as three couplets, unpublished; and as Index 3937 on fol. 93, described as 'a single couplet in a Latin treatise'; Brown, ed., Register , 1:212; but in fact forty-two lines of verse, an allegorisation that shifts tenors at lines 16/17. 4 4. In addition, the manuscript contains Index 2117 'Marie moder' on fol. 3, in the earlier set of sermons. Before passing on to consider these verses and Brown's various handlings of them in more detail, one might note some further codicological details about the Jesus College manuscript, necessarily ignored in Brown's summary presentation of verse contents. The volume remains in probably its original binding, whit- tawed leather with a partial chemise over bevelled boards on five thongs, two sets pegged to a single hole (a specifically fifteenth-century technique). It has an intact pair of straps with metal fittings and staple clasps on the leading edge of the lower board (but no evidence of chaining). The medieval front flyleaves survive, with an indication of contents (including notation of a second folio, a gesture standard in careful institutional library catalogues) and a library pressmark 'N.ii' (later fifteenth century). Although the centre of this leaf, presumably with an in- stitutional ex-libris, has been cut away, James saw (and Neil Ker confirmed) that the book had been in the fifteenth-century library of Durham Cathedral Priory. It passed to Jesus College, with at least forty-six other volumes (another twenty- nine of these medieval Durham books), in 1685 as the donation of Thomas Man, MA and fellow. 5 5. See N. R. Ker, Medieval Libraries of Great Britain: A List of Surviving Books , Royal His- torical Society Guides and Handbooks 3, 2nd edn (London, 1964), 61 (hereafter MLGB); and for Man, John and J. A. Venn, Alumni Cantabrigenses …, 10 vols in two parts (Cambridge, 1922–54), pt. 1, 3:132. The books forming Man's donation were probably all collected by his father, also Thomas; he was vicar of Northallerton (North Riding, Yorkshire), a Durham living, and Jesus College, MS Q.G.26 (James MS 73) has his signature dated 1651, predating Thomas jr's birth. However, James's confusion over the identity of the collector (see vii) has prolifer- ated; cf. Arthur Gray and Frederick Brittain, A History of Jesus College Cambridge (London, 1979), 99. I hope to offer a study of the Mans and their books in the future, and remain grateful to A. I. Doyle for his advice on this subject (as on other features of the manuscript). Above I have identified the hand that copied the sermons with verses as 'what an English palaeographer would describe as a secretary bookhand'. However, both script features and peculiarities of textual rendition indicate that the hand would be more properly be identified as 'continental cursive'. In particular, the scribe regularly writes a v -shaped continental variety of short r , and routinely reproduces t in the same form as c , particularly in final position. (This distribu- tion I normalise in the texts presented in the Transcriptions below.) The writer also displays features that continental scripts share with English secretary, e.g. an open flat lower lobe on g , a bean-shaped form of final - s . Further, the scribe is plainly unused to copying English, and he appears to be doing it literatim, without any real comprehension. He shows persistent dif- ficulty with word-division in his English (see n. 30), and he rather frequently fails to recognise distinctively English letter forms (erratic distinction between y and þ, þ and 3, as well as c and t ). He makes at least one error in transcription because he fails to identify a long anglicana r in his exemplar ('I an' for 'ran', verses c/3). One might possibly specify, on the basis of his frequent reliance on apostrophe- like suspensions for r (as well as er ) that he was an individual of Dutch or south German training. Whatever this continental scribe was up to, both the contextualisation of the first verses he transcribes (item [a]) and the affinities of various remaining items of the manuscript, for much of which information one is in Brown's debt, permit fairly narrow placement of the texts. Wenzel points out that the woman whose enclosure provides the occasion for the first of the sermons (and for the first Jesus verses) is identified by the preacher. Although he reports her name, Alice Huntingfield, Wenzel ends his researches there, perhaps because there is no reference to Alice in Rotha M. Clay and Ann K. Warren's standard studies of enclosed women. 6 6. See fol. 81, where the preacher argues that four things support 'ciuitas anime', a mor dei, l aus dei, y mago dei, and s apiencia, an anagram for Alys. Similarly, on fol. 81 v , he argues that her name might be construed as 'al ys', i.e. she is complete; or that it might be etymolo- gised as 'alliciens' (viz. attracting God's good will), etc. Similarly, on fol. 82, he comments that Alice's 'aliud nomen Huntyngfeld quod pretendit quod debet venari in agro. Quomodo ergo cum sit inclusa, eam ducemus in campum ad venandum maxime. Cum nunquam legamus bo- num hominem in scriptura sacra fuisse venacionis, et ideo si mulierem possemus facere bonam venacionem, hoc foret mirabile'. However, the indefatigable collector of Norfolciana, Francis Blomefield, provides information indicating a provenance for the sermon. He describes a Huntingfield family, who came from a better known Huntingfield, the place four miles southwest of Halesworth, east Suffolk. In spite of these origins, they held the manor of East Bradenham, Norfolk, from the abbey of Bury St Edmunds and the dukes of Leicester and Lancaster, a tenure extending from the late twelfth century until the late fourteenth. 7 7. See An Essay Towards a Topographical History of the County of Norfolk …, 11 vols (London, 1805–10), 6:136–138. Cf. Huntingfield Hall, marked as a ruin with mote, Ordinance Survey Landranger sheet 144, coordinates 9309, north of East Bradenham (two miles south of the A47 west of Dereham). Another book in the Man donation, Jesus College, MS 68 (notes on Decre- tals), is tentatively assigned to the Praemonstratensian house at Wendling, Norfolk (Ker, MLGB 195)—four miles north of Alice's village. Clay, The Hermits and Anchorites of England (London, 1914), 232–237, lists ninety recorded anchorholds and hermitages in Norfolk; the only one with a woman occupant in the period (Ann Whyote, 1384x86) was a hermitage at Southgate, Kings' Lynn, as will emerge shortly, an intriguing provenance. The last Huntingfield lord, William (app. 1331–77), a companion of the Black Prince in Gascony from 1357, left as his next heir a 'kinswoman' (sister?) Alicia. (The name appears earlier, in the late thirteenth century, in Blomefield's account of the family.) Blomefield describes this Alice as aged thirty and the widow of Sir John de Norwich kt. in 1377. But Alice did not inherit, and the estate had passed out of the family by 1404. It is presumably this Alice's inclaustration as pious widow that the sermon marks (and this is presumably the reason she did not, as next heir, inherit from 'her kinsman'). But the occasion is only datable by its biblical text as having oc- curred on a 25 January (the sermon-text is from the epistle for the Conversio Sancti Pauli), and the sermon does not stipulate where Alice was enclosed. East Bradenham, strikingly, falls into an area where one of the manuscript's most distinctive English forms, 'qwow' (how)(verses b/15, 23), would not seem outré; LALME records the form (or related 'qwou') only from seven west, west central, or central south Norfolk linguistic profiles. 8 8. Viz. LALME LPs 649, 735, 4103 (British Library, MS Harley 3954, mentioned below), 4290, 4569, 4629, and 4636 (LALME 4:201). To these, one could add Bodleian Library, MS Ashmole 1393 (V–VI), with 'quowe'. Perhaps similarly indicative of language from the western edge of East Anglia are 'goue' (pt., verses c/26; but note '3af', verses b/25, 43) and 'lijf' (verses g/14); cf. LALME dot maps 432 (1:412) and 819 (1:495) and the conspectus of forms at 4:184 and 209, respectively. Congruent west Norfolk provenance for the Jesus manuscript is implied by such transmission histories as one can uncover for the verses included in its sermons. Two sets of Jesus verses (b, f) appear elsewhere in National Library of Scotland, MS Advocates' 18.7.21, a preacher's notebook incorporating frequent lyric scraps—no surprises here—for use in sermons. All the snippets of verse in the Advocates' manuscript have very narrow recorded circulations; their editor, Edward Wilson, finds no more than five of them in any other manuscript—in this case, British Library, MS Harley 7322, also including Jesus's verses (f). There is every likelihood that the compiler of the Advocates' manuscript, a Franciscan named John of Grimestone, came from the village of that name just east of King's Lynn; LALME places the language of the lyrics in extreme southwest Norfolk, a localisation in accord with the last recorded reference to Grimestone, a license to hear confessions in Ely diocese in 1338. 9 9. See Edward Wilson, A Descriptive Index of the English Lyrics in John of Grimestone's Preaching Book , Medium Ævum Monographs ns 2 (Oxford, 1973), esp. xi, xiii, 33 (no. 155, Jesus f), 52 (no. 205, Jesus b). For the language, see LALME LP 4041, described 1:218, 3:331–332; cf. Angus McIntosh, 'The Language of the Extant Versions of Havelok the Dane ', Medium Ævum 45 (1976), 36–49, at 44–45, where the book is mapped as MS 30. However, the two poems the Jesus manuscript shares with Grimestone's preaching book (enough of a conjunction for Wilson to mention the book imme- diately after Harley 7322) are not the full account of possible relationship. It is not particularly clear why Brown chose to assign Jesus verses (c) a separate Index entry, as item 4185. As his cross-reference implies, the poem is simply the sepa- rately indexed Index 4200, with an extra concluding stanza and different order for the stanzas. 10 10. Religious Lyrics , 227–228, where the stanzas appear in an order corresponding to Jesus 1–2, 7, 6, [not parallel], 3, 5, and 4, respectively. But one should notice that the Jesus version closely follows a standard order for presenting the Seven Sins (Envy is misplaced), a testimony to the learnedness of the preacher who included it in this form in his sermon. Index 4200 has a fairly wide dispersal, mainly in the later fifteenth century, but the only particularly relevant example, to which I will return momentarily, occurs in British Library, MS Additional 37049. Whatever the case about its ordering, the poem appears a derivative of one in Grimestone's book, Index 3356 (Wilson 49–51, no. 199), seven eight-line stanzas in corresponding order. In the Jesus presentation, the poem has been edited, cut to half the length of Grimestone's version; but the language of the two presen- tations remains fairly close at both head and end of the text (and considerably more proximate than Index 197, Wilson 56–57, no. 218). The poem shows the Jesus preacher potentially as redacting an earlier Franciscan text for a particular pulpit context. Harley 7322, although it includes no notation of clerical provenance, is cer- tainly a preacher's book comparable to the Advocates' manuscript. It includes numerous exempla for pulpit use, especially a few accompanied by verse, and a few sermons. Its extensive illustrative narratives (to one of which, Herbert's no. 138, Jesus verses [f] is appended), provide the type of material always seen as typifying mendicant sermons (and a frequent target of antimendicant invective). McIntosh suggests placing the Middle English of the Harley verses on the Ely/ Suffolk border just south of the two counties' juncture with Norfolk; the localisa- tion is adjacent to that assigned John of Grimestone's book. 11 11. In addition to Furnivall's presentation of the verses, Political , 220–243, see J. A. Her- bert, Catalogue of Romances in … the British Museum 3 (London, 1910), esp. 177–179. For the placement of LALME's hand B (1:113), see McIntosh, 'The Language', 44–45 (MS 35). If books like Advocates' (certainly) and Harley (putatively) imply a west Nor- folk Franciscan ambit for the verses available to the Jesus preacher, some more attenuated references may help solidify the case. Grimestone includes in the Advocates' manuscript a copy of Index 1523 (Wilson 42–49, no. 198), an ABC of the Passion. The poem appears in this form elsewhere only at British Library, MS Harley 3954, fol. 87, among a set of lyrics, many (but not this one) shared with Cambridge University Library, MS Ii.iv.9. Both these books, although likely lay productions, are localised by LALME in south central Norfolk. 12 12. Respectively LALME LP 4103 (1:112, 3:335–336) and LP 621 (1:68, 3:314–315; cf. also McIntosh, 'The Language', 44–45, MS 21). The first was copied by a scribe named 'Heron' and includes Piers Plowman A , in a form limited to the western edges of East Anglia, the subjects of Simon Horobin's forthcoming study; the second was in the Worsted area in the late fifteenth century. Most of the manuscripts to which I refer appear in Richard Beadle, 'Prolegomena to a literary geography of later medieval Norfolk', in Regionalism in Late Medieval Manuscripts and Texts , ed. Felicity Riddy (Cambridge, 1991), 89–108, viz. Ii.4.9 = no. 41; Lat. th. d.1 = no. 81; Jesus 13 = no. 94 (queried); Advocates' 18.7.21 = no. 98; Harley 3954 = no. 111; the related Piers A 's of London, Society of Antiquaries, MS 687 = no. 112 and Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 851 = no. 113. However, Harley 3954 does not provide the only example of Norfolk circula- tion of these verses. Index 1523 underlies a macaronic Good Friday sermon with alphabetical development in the preaching book, Bodleian Library, MS Lat. th. d.1, fols 123 v –126 v . There the sermon is marked as having been preached 'Noui Castri [Newcastle upon Tyne], 1433'. However, both Nicholas Philip, who made this preaching book, and William Melton, four of whose sermons are included here, were Franciscans of King's Lynn. This is the only Franciscan house in west Norfolk, and it is surely significant that proximate Franciscan preachers show some evidence of recycling materials like Grimestone's for their mission. 13 13. The sermon is item 42, as described Alan J. Fletcher, 'The Sermon Booklets of Friar Nicholas Philip', Medium Ævum 55 (1986), 188–202 (cf. Wenzel, Macaronic , 40–43, 165–173). This is the only sermon printed from the manuscript; cf. A. G. Little, 'A Fifteenth-Century Ser- mon', Franciscan Papers, Lists, and Documents (Manchester, 1943), 244–256. On the provenance of Eng. th. d.1, see Ker, Medieval Libraries of Great Britain , 127, 228, 280. More attenuated Franciscan connections appear in the Jesus manuscript itself. As Wenzel notes, it shares three sermons with Arras, Bibliothèque mu- nicipale, MS 184. 14 15. See the description, Wenzel, Macaronic , 206–210 passim. The relevant items, Wenzel's Z-43, Z-04, and Z-06, respectively, appear as a block in Jesus 13, shortly after the sermons with verses that inspire this discussion: Fols 100 v –104: 'Hic est Iesus rex Matthei 27[:37] Scitis quando pauper qui haberet mag- num negocium pertractandum…', for Good Friday; Fols 104–107 v : 'Petite et dabitur vobis Luce 11[:9] Secundum Walensem de penitencia volens orare et aliquid a deo petere…', with no occasion; Fols 107 v –110: 'In domo tua oportet me manere Luce 19[:5] Scribitur 2 o . Paralipomeni 6. de prima ecclesia templo scilicet Iherusalem quod rex Salamon edificauit…', for the Dedica- tion of the Church. This large book of sermons was certainly collected (probably from various sources) and copied in England at the opening of the fifteenth cen- tury, as its anglicana hand indicates. But whatever the common source Jesus and Arras manuscripts are drawing upon here, the Arras scribe certainly had access to other Franciscan sermons of narrow dispersal. For the book also includes three items at least associated with the Oxford career, inferentially 1378x83, of one Henry 'Chambron' (i.e., Champernon) OFM. 15 15. These are, respectively, Wenzel, Macaronic , 206–208, nos Z-01 (here ascribed and dated 1382), Z-19 (not Champernon, for it includes a reference to his similar sermon, but as- cribed him with a dating implicitly 1378x83 at Oxford, Christ Church, MS 91, fol. 122), and Z-20 (an expanded version of a sermon ascribed to Champernon in Oxford, Balliol College, MS 149). Note also Hereford, Cathedral Library, MS P.i.9, fols 150 v –151 v ', an English devo- tional tract ascribed to Champernon, in a Franciscan book of the very late fourteenth century and of fairly continuous Franciscan ownership through the fifteenth (e.g. Ker, MLGB 142, 288). Now see further Wenzel, Latin Sermon Collections from Later Medieval England: Orthodox Preaching in the Age of Wycliffe (Cambridge, 2005), 125–131. Production of Jesus 13 within the context of such an international order would go some way to explaining the non- English features (and unfamiliarity with English) evident in the scribal handling of the verses I discuss. Although general Franciscan connections, and specifically those with (west) Norfolk establishments, appear prominent, one should note a few examples of comparable verses escaping into a more general (but apparently still limited) cir- culation. Above I mentioned the copy of Index 4200, a variant rendition of Jesus verses (c), in British Library, MS Additional 37049. This famous 'Carthusian Miscellany' has typically been associated with the Charterhouse at Axholme, in extreme northwest Lincolnshire; its contents, however, materials associated with veneration of Richard Rolle and 'The Desert of Religion', have a distinctly southwest Yorkshire flavour, one partly confirmed by (one component of) its scribal language. 16 16. A full facsimile, ed. Alan Fletcher, has been announced by the University of Leeds; until its appearance, see the partial rendition, James Hogg, An Illustrated Carthusian Religious Miscellany: British Library London Additional MS37049 , Analecta Gartusiana 95/3 (Salzburg, 1981). For the various languages, see LALME 1:102, 3:397–398 (north Notts.), 3:634-635 (West Riding Yorkshire). Similar examples of Grimestone's materials in peripheral areas of Yorkshire and in adjacent counties can be multiplied. Jesus verses (c), for example, ap- pears elsewhere only in Cambridge University Library, MS Ff.v.48. The hand of this portion, who signs as 'Gilbert Pylkyngton', is placed by LALME in western Derbyshire; a second scribe, responsible only for the single quire fols 79–85 v , with excerpts from The South English Legendary , displays language of extreme West Yorkshire along the Lancashire border. 17 17. See LALME 1:67 and, for the unmapped LP 199, 3:569–570; cf. Manfred Görlach, The Textual Tradition of the South English Legendary (Leeds, 1974), 126–127. Similarly, Tokyo, Toshiyuki Takamiya, MS 15, in a series of short texts following Speculum Vitae , reproduces two of Grimestone's lyrics, their unique appearances outside the Advocates' manu- script, a versified Ten Commandments ( Index 1129) and 'Ecce sto ad ostium' ( Index 3825). The language of this manuscript implies copying in the Barnsley- Rotherham(-Sheffield?) area, although there is some possibility that others of its exemplars similarly reflect transmission from more southeasterly parts. Perhaps significantly in this context, the book includes a note dated 1486, directing that it be donated to the Franciscans of Lichfield in return for requiem masses. 18 18. For a description, see Toshiyuki Takamiya, '"On the Evils of Covetousness": An Unrecorded Middle English Poem', in New Science out of Old Books: Studies in Manuscripts and Early Printed Books in Honour of A. I. Doyle , ed. Richard Beadle and A. J. Piper (Aldershot, 1995), 189–206. Finally, British Library, MS Additional 45896, a roll now misplaced, uniquely agrees with the Advocates' manuscript in transmitting Index 212; the roll, although probably copied in Shropshire, contains a series of Yorkshire texts, and the Grimestone verses here head a more extended lyric certainly of Northern provenance. 19 19. See 'With an O (Yorks.) or an I (Salop.)? The Middle English Lyrics of British Library Additional 45896', Studies in Bibliography 48 (1995), 290-297. The copy of Jesus verses (d) in British Library, MS Royal 8 C.xii is simply extraneous. As George F. Warner and Julius P. Gilson, Catalogue of Western Manuscripts in the Old Royal and King's Collections , 4 vols (London, 1921), 1:238, point out, the verses have been added, s. xvi, on a flyleaf by John Bristow, formerly monk of Hailes (OCist, Gloucs.), at the time vicar of Rodbourne Cheyney (Wilts.); the book, de Voragine's Lenten sermons, was given him by dom John Stockburge. All these examples perhaps testify to circulation from western Norfolk to another Franciscan centre, most likely, given the distribution of such survivors, the house at Doncaster in south Yorkshire. It is worth recalling that Nicholas Philip's sermon indicates a mission to the North (a possible indication of how the Jesus manuscript might later have ended up at Durham?). Moreover, there is also evidence of his colleague, William Melton, preaching in York City, c. 1426. 20 20. See Alexandra Johnston and Margaret Rogerson, eds., Records of Early English Drama: York , 2 vols (Toronto, 1979); 1:42–44. Lambeth Palace Library, MS 260, which contains four unrecognised Grimestone-Harley 7322 lyrics (additional copies of Index 221, 2155, 2260, 3858), provides a further example. The book is associable with Yorkshire friars (certainly York Domini- cans after 1485, inferentially Beverley Franciscans earlier). Providing such a contextualisation for Jesus MS 13 was, of course, foreign to Carleton Brown's efforts with the manuscript, designed simply to list its verse items. But his (mis)reportage of these verse scraps deserves more detailed con- sideration for what it reveals about the literary status of these materials. Brown's persistent reference to all Jesus materials as 'in a Latin treatise' indicates that, not only did he never examine the context of the verses, he had no notion of the generic affinities of the texts they accompany (or that these were multiple sermons and, thus, scarcely of the writerly sort 'treatise' implies). Moreover, the particularly dire report of verses (g) as four separated couplets, not the forty-two lines that actually occur, is telling. Brown, it would appear, could only recognise verse on the basis of rhyme. Given its failure in the inad- equately represented first couplet of the poem (see the edition in the Transcrip- tions), Brown could only identify as verse the second couplet and what followed. When rhyme failed again, in what is clearly supposed to be a couplet but is reported as a simple English tag at lines *9–10, Brown assumed there was no more poetry. In this, he was materially aided by the scribe, who dropped the obvious rhymeword 'smerte' from the subsequent couplet. One can only guess how Brown managed to turn up Index 3937, actually the fifteenth couplet in the sequence, while ignoring both intermediate (and following) materials. At least one possibility is worth considering. Brown adopted as a convention not to index the ubiquitous rhyming English triplets that routinely mark divi- sions within sermones moderni in both Latin and English. (Through an inattention to context, like that I describe here, a certain number of them did get into his Index and more still into later 'corrected versions' of the Index .) Thus, Brown has properly, by his conventions, ignored verses like the unindexed incipit of the second sermon in the sequence I have described above and the transitional mo- ment of the same text: Pro processu, sciendum est quod triplici de causa Cristus pro nobis mortuus est: primo for to destruyyn ye deuelys my3th 2 o . for to makyn vus strong in fy3th et 3 o . for to restoryn vus to owr ry3th. (fol. 84 v ) In the scrappy bits describing the armour of the Christian knight Ratio in verses (g), especially given their alternation with English prose phrases in the Latin, Brown may have felt he was dealing with similar materials to be ignored. Since he seems to have been immune to the surround of the verses and to their integration within an ongoing argument, in which they translate similar Latin rhymes (the internal ones of the leonine hexametres the preacher cites), this may appear a rational decision. Yet such inattention was to substantially influence Brown's behaviour as an editor of verse. Having, through his careful manuscript searching, discovered multiple copies of texts like these, Brown found himself routinely faced with choices between recorded versions. Willing to print only a single one, he typi- cally made decisions on a vaguely 'aesthetic' basis. For example, having chosen to present Grimestone's version of Jesus verses (b), he defended the decision by referring to the Jesus copy as 'a later and much corrupted text of the present version'. After drawing attention to the different stanza order in Jesus (whilst ignoring that the text is more extensive than that Grimestone provides), he went on to characterise the poem as 'degenerat[ing] into ballad metre through the loss of the rimes uniting the first and third lines'. 21 21. Religious Lyrics , 268. Had Brown attended to the text in which the verses had been dispersed, he might have come to different conclusions. He correctly saw that the opening of the poem restates Micah 6:3–4; because he paid no attention to the Latin sur- round, he failed to see in what interest this biblical locus had been cited. The preacher's immediate introduction to the verses states it: Recordatur enim ecclesia hodiema die in officio ac sacra scriptura quod Deus decem solempnia beneficia contulit Iudeis contra que hodiema die maleficia ei reddebant. (fol. 85) Thus, the poem appears here only to anglicise the liturgy for the sermon's occa- sion, persistendy marked as Good Friday. As a result, one could argue the most pressing aesthetic questions the lines raise should concern the liturgical moment at issue and how well the verses convey the preacher's report of that liturgical occasion. As Wenzel is well aware, what is being versified here are the 'improperia' or 'reproaches' central to the Good Friday service. These include the biblical open- ing Brown recognised and a sequence of three additional clauses: Popule meus quid feci tibi? Aut in quo contristaui te? Responde mihi. Quia eduxi te de terra Egypti, parasti crucem saluatori tuo…. Quia eduxi te per desertum quadraginta annis et manna cibaui te et introduxi in terram satis bonam, parasti crucem saluatori tuo…. Quid vltra debui facere tibi et non feci ego? Quidem plantaui te uinea mea fructu decora, et tu facta es michi satis amara: aceto namque mixto cum felle sitim meam parasti, et lancea perforasti latus saluatori tuo. 22 22. See Wenzel, Preachers , 153; and for the liturgical text, J. Wickam Legg, The Sarum Mis- sal edited from Three Early Manuscripts (Oxford, 1916), 112–113; cf. Missale ad usum insignis ecclesiae Eboracensis , 2 vols, Surtees Society 59–60 (Durham, 1874), 105; and Missale ad usum percelebris Ecclesiae Herefordensis (Leeds, 1874), 94. Or so the reported English Uses, which scarcely respond either to the profusion of verses in the Jesus version or to the preacher's claim that ignoring ten benefits produces ten different reproaches for Jewish Good Friday behaviour. The liturgical practice the poem reports offers further grounds for associat- ing it with an international religious order, like the Franciscans. For whatever English liturgical uses report, those more widely used in the universal church (and thus by its orders), that of Rome for example, provide extensive materials analogous to, although not identical with, the Jesus verses. These typically have eight to ten reproaches, following on a general opening like that reported in Eng- lish Uses; and these extras, at least broadly, fill in the Sarum Use introduction in ways corresponding with the progress of the argument in Jesus. Moreover, the Roman presentation corresponds exactly to the handling in an earlier English Franciscan version of the 'reproaches', composed by (and pre- served in the autograph of) William Herebert, of the Hereford convent. Here- bert's version pretty precisely renders the Sarum Use introduction (verses 1–17), followed by eight reproaches in the continental form, two of them separate in modern rites but fused by Herebert in a way analogous to the Jesus presentation (verses 18–34). 23 23. Franciscans in the late thirteenth-century produced the ancestor of modern 'Roman Use' by revising a Roman curial ritual to conform to the Order's rite; see S. J. P. van Dijk and J. Hazelden Walker, The Origins of the Modern Roman Liturgy: The Liturgy of the Papal Court and the Franciscan Order in the Thirteenth Century (Westminster MD, 1960). The post-Tridentine Missale Romanum (Rome, 1909), 183–184, presents the opening in the English rites but then continues: Ego propter te flagellavi Ægyptum cum primogenitis suis, et tu me flagellatum tradidisti Ego eduxi te de Ægypto, demerso Pharaone in Mare rubrum, et tu me tradidisti principis sacerdotum Ego ante te aperui mare, et tu aperuisti lancea latus meum Ego ante te praeivi in columna nubis, et tu me duxisti ad praetorium Pilati Ego te pavi manna per desertum, et tu me cecidisti alapis et flagellis Ego te potavi aqua salutis de petra, et tu me potuisti felle et aceto Ego propter te Chananaeorum reges percussi, et tu percussi arundine caput meum Ego dedi tibi sceptrum regale, et tu dedisti capiti meo spineam coronam Ego te exaltavi magna virtute, et tu me suspendisti in patibulo crucis For Herebert's version ( Index 2241), see Religious Lyrics , 17–18. The Jesus stanzas, a much less exact reproduction, appear to offer Sarum clauses 1, 2 in part, Roman clauses 2 + 3 (also fused in Herebert), Sarum clause 2 in part (the Latin mentions the manna of Roman clause 5), Ro- man clause 7, a benefit (I gave you laws) parallelled in neither liturgy, Sarum clause 2 in part, and Roman clauses 6, 8, and 4. Brown's difficulty here was generated out of the way in which the project of collecting 'English poetry' was initially and continues generally, even in Wenzel's fine studies, to be conceived. Brown's work, and that of others after him, seeks to prioritise English vemacularity, every last scrap of it. 24 24. It need hardly be said that Brown manifestly failed at this goal, as numerous later articles offering overlooked items have pointed out. Indeed, as this note will indicate, future revisers of his work will improve on (as opposed to update) his cataloguing only by reindexing those manuscripts Brown claimed to have exhausted (and frequently did not; my surveys sug- gest that there are a very great many unrecorded items in books Brown examined). There are difficulties inherent in the nationalistic bases of this enterprise; one could well object that Anglo-Latin and Anglo-Norman are English too. But the project, significantly undertaken well in advance of any comparable effort with prose, also rests on a Victorian/modernist perception of verse as a uniquely evocative, imaginative form. 25 25. Cf. Brown's discussion of John of Grimestone's Advocates' manuscript, Religious Lyrics , xvi–xix, as 'one of the most important collections of English lyrics'. Only belatedly in his treat- ment (xix) does he recognise the book as not designed as a lyric anthology at all, but directly comparable to another preacher's book, bishop John Sheppey's Oxford, Merton College, MS 258 (in which Brown also failed to spot much of the English). I doubt this a property most readers today would attribute to the ma- terials printed in the Transcriptions below—or indeed to the majority of items enumerated in Index of Middle English Verse , a statement not intended to denigrate the value of such works for any variety of nonaestheticised purposes. Most troublingly, the procedure often reifies English texts as selfsubstantial in ways that severely belie their actual forma vivendi in manuscript. Indeed, as Wenzel ceaselessly reminds one, English verse in these contexts is integral to polyglot tendencies widespread in medieval English culture. 26 26. For extensive examples of polyglot writing in other spheres, see the contributions of Laura Wright, on business records, conveniently listed, 'Bills, Accounts, Inventories: Everyday Trilingual Activities in the Business World of Later Medieval England', in Multilingualism in Later Medieval Britain , ed. D. A. Trotter (Cambridge, 2000), 149–156; or Tony Hunt's many writings, principally on grammatical and medical texts. Whether or not Jesus's Good Friday sermon was delivered in Latin (and with such texts, language of record and language of performance may well differ), the verses it includes depend upon at least a rudimentary understanding of their imbrication in and distanced reproduction of Latin ritual language. The importance of such contextualisation of verse is perhaps even clearer in Jesus verses (g), which I here resuscitate from Brown's handling. Brown's missteps are salutary to consider: in failing to recognise English before his eyes as precisely what he was seeking, Brown essentially proved that the verses can only exist im- bricated in a Latin context. In any conventional sense, there is scarcely a poem here at all—rather a Latin allegorisation of a temple of virtue and of the armour appropriate to its guardian/doorward, Ratio. This temple and ruler are imag- ined pictorially, as if a medieval memory map, each architectural or armourial feature adorned with a scroll with explanatory leonine hexametre (perhaps a sign that this sermon was delivered in Latin). The English verses, which lack either English introduction or English explanation of what they map, are sensible only as vernacular renderings of a comprehended Latin surround. In isolation (as the consecutive English text Brown liked to print), they are very nearly senseless, the odd bits that Brown presumably rejected as sermon tags, maybe even as prose. Perhaps, rather than just indexing and editing such things, one might more carefully consider the context—fihere west Norfolk Franciscan sermons— that grants them their exiguous circulation.

ROYAL-PAPER COPIES OF ALDINE EDITIONS, 1494–1550 by Conor Fahy * * This article is an English version, with some adaptations, of "Esemplari su carta reale di edizioni aldine, 1494–1550", published in La Bibliofilía 106 (2004), 135–172. I am grateful to Luigi Balsamo, Direttore of La Bibliofilía , for permission to use the same material here. I have incorporated into the present article the "Addenda" published at the end of the Italian version, together with some other additional information. Both are annotated and enlarged versions of the third Sandars Lecture in Bibliography, which I delivered in the University of Cambridge on 20 March 2002. Lecture and articles formed part of a research project which for reasons of health I was unable to complete. However the results achieved seemed of sufficient interest to warrant their publication. In the circumstances I have incurred more than the usual number of debts towards friends and colleagues, without whose help it would have been impossible to bring this work to its present state. My greatest debt is to Neil Harris, who has responded with unfailing generosity and despatch to my repeated requests for information and help. I am deeply grateful also to the following, who have given me valuable information about individual copies on royal paper of Aldine editions, or helped me in other ways: Ursula Baurmeister, Charles Benson, John Bidwell, T. Kimball Brooker, Sara Centi, Maurizio Festanti, H. George Fletcher, Jean-François Gilmont, Paul Naiditch, Charles Noble, Getrud Oswald, Stephen Par- kin, Paul Quarrie, Francesco Radaeli, Julie Ramwell, Chiara Razzolini, Susan Roeper, Paola Rucci, Fred Schreiber, Emmanuelle Toulet, Julia Walworth and Andreas Wittenberg.

The question of royal-paper copies of Aldine editions, of which the bulk of the surviving copies are printed on smaller paper, first impinged on my consciousness a few years ago, in the course of a collaborative research project on the first edition of Baldassar Castiglione's Il libro del Cortegiano , a folio printed by the Aldine press between the end of November 1527 and the beginning of April 1528. In a letter sent from Spain in April 1527 to his factor, Cristoforo Tirabosco, Castiglione expressed the wish to have an edition of 1000 copies, for which he did not specify a paper size, plus thirty copies to be printed on the best quality royal paper available in Venice at the time. In a further letter to Tirabosco, written in April 1528, after the publication of the edition, Castiglione again referred to the thirty copies on royal paper, indicating that some at least were intended as presentation copies to important figures, such as the marquis of Mantua, Isabella d'Este and Elisabetta Gonzaga, "quelli più principali", as he explained. 1 1. For the text of the letters see Quondam, pp. 538–539, 542–543; for an English transla- tion of the relevant part of the first letter see Fahy 2000, p. 150 (for full details of these and other works mentioned in the notes, see the list of "Works Cited" at the end of the article). Our census of surviving copies of this edition brought to light 147 copies, 2 2. For a list see Fahy 2000, pp. 161–164. The census was limited to copies in libraries open to scholars. none of which was distinguished by its leaf height, but which were printed on two different paper stocks, 136 on stocks (predominantly anchor paper) which we know from the evidence of an uncut copy in the library of the Diocesan Seminary, Padua, to be super-chancery, and eleven, all bound and trimmed, on another sort of anchor paper, easily distinguishable from the stocks used in the majority of copies by having no countermark. 3 3. In the Venetian printing industry of the first half of the sixteenth century three paper sizes predominated, all represented in the famous fourteenth-century Bolognese tablet of forme sizes, for which see Briquet, I, p. 3. These are royal: c.445 × 615 mm; median: c.345 × 515 mm; chancery: c.315 × 450 mm. Towards the end of the fifteenth century, however, slightly taller versions of royal and chancery appeared, christened by Paul Needham, in a seminal essay (Needham 1993–-94), super-royal and super-chancery. In the same essay Needham also showed that for his octavo editions Aldus used a new paper size, measuring c.350 × 420mm, which Needham named narrow median (see also Needham 1994). The widespread use in the Venetian printing industry of the 1490s of a chancery sheet sligtly taller than the Bologna standard was also one of the findings of the researchers of Progetto carta; see Ornato, ii, pp. 270–279 (regret- tably this lengthy work, full of information about paper and paper-making in fifteenth-century Italy and its neighbours, and about the paper of Venetian incunables, has no analytical index). In my experience, in the period up to 1550 the Aldine press consistendy Used super-chancery for the ordinary-paper copies of its folio editions. It was tempting to assume that these eleven copies were the survivors of the thirty copies on royal paper ordered by Castiglione, but to have been reduced to their present size all eleven must have undergone a savage trimming over the centuries, reducing the leaf size of an untrimmed royal folio (c.445 × 307 mm) to that of a trimmed super- chancery folio (c.315 × 220 mm). Since the royal-paper copies, or some of them, were destined originally for illustrious personages, it seemed odd that not one of our eleven should have leaf dimensions which indicated that it might have been printed on royal paper. But because of the pressure of other work I put the problem to one side. My interest in the question was rekindled recently by the chance encounter, in the pages of the catalogue of the Aldine collection of the Harry Ransom Hu- manities Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin, of an entry relat- ing to the 1536 folio edition of the commentary by the Byzantine philosopher and theologian Eustratius of Nicea on the Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle. Alongside a first copy of the edition, for which, in accordance with the general practice of the catalogue, no leaf size was given, the collection also contained a second copy, on "very large paper", measuring 425 × 270 mm. 4 4. See Kallendorf and Wells, p. 254. The dimensions given are those of the binding; leaf measurements will be slightly smaller. For the edition see Renouard, p. 116; Cataldi Palau, pp. 664–665. The discovery of a folio edition published by the Aldine press less than ten years after the Cortegiano , containing a copy printed on what seemed like royal paper, led me to reopen the question of the eleven copies of the Cortegiano printed on paper different from that used in the main run. And the first step was clearly that of finding out whether, in the production of the Aldine press, there were other known examples of this usage. In the last fifty years many important studies have been published on the press, particularly for the period from 1494 to 1515, when it was directed by the great Aldus. These studies have given us a much deeper knowledge of the cultural importance of Aldus's publication programme, of his relations with the international world of scholarship, of the commercial organization of the press, of the various series of types created by and for him, and of the links between the press and the Venetian art world. But in all this activity there has been a notable absentee—a serious interest in the descriptive bibliography of the Aldine press. One of the obstacles is, no doubt, the high survival rate of Aldine editions, which have been collectors' items from the date of their publication. Accord- ing to the Incunable Short-Title Catalogue fourteen of the thirty-eight Aldines recorded therein have survived in more than 100 copies, seven in more than 200. No comparable figures are available for the sixteenth century, but our 147 copies of the Cortegiano surviving in libraries open to scholars are unlikely to be exceptional. In the only comparative study of a sixteenth-century Aldine edition to have been published in the last half-century Cecil Clough identified 83 copies of Pietro Bembo's Gli Asolani (1505); on a smaller scale Giuseppe Frasso listed eleven surviving vellum copies of the 1501 Petrarch. 5 5. See Clough 1969 and 1972; Frasso, pp. 326–334. Any attempt to survey the publishing history of an Aldine edition is likely to involve the enquirer in the sort of wide-ranging study illustrated by the Castiglione project. 6 6. In this context mention must be made of Neil Harris's on-going work on physical fea- tures of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (1499). Harris 2004 contains the results of the analysis of sixty-seven copies of the edition; see also Harris 2006. I do not deny the usefulness of recent catalogues of Aldine exhibitions and collections, but for our purpose their scope is limited—it does not go beyond the description (often to the highest standards of bibliographical precision) of a single copy, or at most of two or three copies, of an edition. Many of these publications, too, are limited to the production of the Aldine press in the period 1494–1515. So it is not as surprising as it might first appear that for a general enquiry into the composition of Aldine editions, covering not only the deeply studied twenty-one years of Aldus's leadership of the press, but also its production in sub- sequent decades, one is still forced to have recourse to a work of bibliographical scholarship which appeared in its final form more than 175 years ago, Antoine- Augustin Renouard's Annales de l'imprimerie des Alde (3rd ed. 1834). The purpose of Renouard's Annales was "fixer l'existence et l'état de chacune des productions de cette célèbre Imprimerie", for the benefit of potential customers. For years, in his antiquarian bookshop in Paris and during his business trips to other countries, Renouard had brought together information about the various copies of Aldine editions which had passed through his hands, or which he had seen on the shelves of many of the great European libraries, public and private. So he was in a posi- tion to provide a description of the editions recorded in his Annales which, though incomplete in many respects, was often full of precise detail and frequently took account of differences between copies. All the research on which this article is based has its origins in the perusal of this remarkable book. In his descriptions of Aldine editions Renouard mentions four types of special copies. They are: (1) Copies on vellum Vellum copies are certainly the best known of these special copies, particu- larly for the famous series of octavo editions of Latin, Greek and Italian classics which Aldus began to publish in 1501. Vellum copies are known of almost all the texts published in this series between 1501 and 1505. From the letters exchanged between Isabella d'Este and Lorenzo da Pavia in the summer of 1501, when the first titles in the series began to appear on the market, we know that about fifteen vellum copies of the Petrarch were printed, a total limited only by the scarcity in Venice at that time of vellum of a suitable quality. Further information about other surviving vellum copies of Aldine octavos of this period has come to light thanks to the attention recently given to illuminated copies of Aldine editions. 7 7. For the Petrarch see Brown, pp. 55–56, doc. 40. Forty-five vellum copies of Aldine editions, for the most part octavos, illuminated in Italy between 1496 and 1502, are listed by Sz�pe, pp. 165–193. To the eleven vellum copies of the 1501 Petrarch listed by Frasso she adds a further three, two in the DSB and one in the HRHRC; for the latter see Kallendorf and Wells, p. 80 (library abbreviations used in this contribution are listed at the beginning of the Appendix). The vellum copies were not intended, or were not all intended, as presentation copies for patrons or powerful friends; as the correspondence between Isabella and Lorenzo makes clear, they could also be bought. From the information in Renouard's Annales it is clear that the practice of including vellum copies in the print run of Aldine octavos continued long after the death of Aldus, certainly at least until the series of octavo editions of the works of Cicero with which, in 1540 and 1541, Aldus's son Paulus sought to re-establish the firm as a cultural force at international level. 8 8. Of the more than sixty editions with vellum copies listed by Renouard for the period 1494–1550, about fifty are octavos; see also, for the period 1540–1541, Brooker, p. 68. As for folio and quarto editions, the Aldine press continued the practice widespread in the incunable period of including vellum copies in the print run of certain editions. Vellum copies survive of the great five- volume edition of the works of Aristotle, published in the years 1495–1498, and of several other folio and quarto editions, such as the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili of 1499, Bembo's Gli Asolani of 1505, the Celsus of 1528 and the Eustratius of 1536. 9 9. The list is indicative, not exhaustive. For the whereabouts of some copies, see the rel- evant information in Renouard, and also Bigliazzi, p. 255, scheda 137; Harris 2004, p. 134; Clough 1969, p. 39; Hobson, p. 166, n. 477; Szépe, pp. 165–193. From the second letter of Castiglione to Cristoforo Tirabosco, written after the Cortegiano had been published, it seems that the friends who were supervising its publication in Venice had at least contemplated the possibility of printing a copy on vellum. In the event of this vellum copy having been printed, Castiglione gave detailed instructions about its binding. In 1890, according to Domenico Bemoni, there was a copy on vellum of the 1528 Cortegiano in the Biblioteca Comunale (now Civica), Verona (see Bemoni, p. 307). This copy, if it ever existed, is now lost. (2) Copies of folio and quarto editions "en (sur) grand papier" Renouard gives only a negative indication of the size of these copies: they are not as large as those of a group of four editions of Greek texts published between 1525 and 1536 with some copies printed on paper "d'une grandeur exagérée". Fortunately, as we shall see, Renouard gives precise measurements for these copies, from which it is clear that the paper "d'une grandeur exagérée" is royal paper. So the paper of copies "en grand papier" is, in his opinion, smaller than royal. Unfortunately, the other information Renouard gives about copies "en grand papier" and in general about the paper of other Aldine folios and quartos is bedevilled by the total absence of any reference to the watermarks oc- curring in the papers of the copies he is discussing. The subject clearly requires further exploration. From my few soundings in this direction I offer the following observations: (a) in the first fifty years of the Aldine press there are at least three edi- tions, the first a folio and the other two quartos, in which the main print run— possibly the whole of the print run—would seem to have been on royal paper. These are the two-volume Valla of 1501, the Plutarch of 1509 and the reprint (1520?) of the Demosthenes of 1504. 10 10. I am indebted to Neil Harris for drawing my attention to the Demosthenes reprint. An- other candidate for a print run wholly or mainly on royal paper, which I have not investigated, is the two-volume Rhetores Graeci of 1508–1509, in quarto. The leaf measurements of the two volumes of this edition in the UCLA copy are 273 × 175 mm and 276 × 176 mm respectively (Ahmanson-Murphy, pp. 98, 101). The Cambridge copy of the Valla (CUL Sel.1.2–3) has leaf measurements of 407 × 274 mm; recent catalogues give the leaf measurements of two other copies as 416 × 273 mm (Centi, p. 595) and 427 × 281 mm (vol.1) (Ahmanson-Murphy, p. 71). For the Plutarch, Renouard had sup- posed that the book had been printed on half-sheets, "le plus grand des livres Aldins, le Georgius Valla , 1501, n'approchant point de la grandeur qu'auroit eue le papier du Plutarque tiré entier" (p. 56), but he was wrong. Had he noticed the evi- dence provided by the watermarks, regularly present in each gathering of this edi- tion, he would have realised that it had been printed on whole sheets. In the only copy I have been able to consult (CUL 524.i.4, leaf measurements 287 × 177 mm) the sheet size deducible from these dimensions (at least 354 × 574 mm) clearly falls within the category of royal paper (c.450 × 615 mm). As for the Demosthenes—a quarto, and not a folio, as generally stated—the dimensions of the Cambridge copy (CUL Tb.52.56, 273 × 168 mm) also show the use of royal paper, but there is an irregular distribution of watermarks in individual gatherings suggesting that parts, if not all, of the book were printed by half-sheet imposition; 11 11. Dimensions of other copies of the Plutarch are: BLaur D'Elci 187, 280 × 170 mm (Centi, p. 457); UCLA *Z 233 A4P74m, 272 × 185 mm (Ahmanson-Murphy, pp. 99–100); and of the Demosthenes: BLaur D'Elci 887, 272 × 175 mm (Centi, pp. 194–195); UCLA *Z 233 A4D390, 276 × 173 mm (Ahmanson-Murphy, pp. 151–152). (b) Renouard (p. 76) speaks explicitly of copies "sur un papier plus grand, plus fort, et d'une beauté remarquable" of a group of folio editions of Greek texts published between 1514 and 1518. The paper used was "le même qui avoit été employé pour les éditions entières d'Hérodote, Thucydide, &amp;c." As these two editions were printed in 1502, the matter deserves further investigation, if only for the possibility that the press had kept for many years, or had replenished its holdings of, a paper stock of superior quality to be used only in the printing of folio editions of Greek texts; (c) in various places Renouard speaks of other editions with copies "en grand papier", "en papier fort", or "en papier plus beau". These observations, too, par- ticularly those referring to the earliest Aldine editions, deserve further investiga- tion. But Renouard's remarks, lacking as they do any reference to the watermarks of the paper in individual copies, run the risk of being merely impressionistic, as is illustrated by the words he dedicated in 1834 to the folio edition of Philostratus published in 1501: In my first edition I said that some copies of this edition could be found on large paper. I have since discovered that the whole edition is printed on the same strong and very beautiful paper. The difference in size is merely the result of the greater or lesser degree of conservation of the copies. 12 12. "Dans ma première édition j'ai dit che l'on trouvoit de ce livre quelques exemplaires en grand papier. J'ai vérifié depuis che toute l'édition est sur un même papier fort, et d'une grande beauté. La différence de dimension n'est que le résultat du plus ou moins de conserva- tion des exemplaires" (p. 26). However, the only test I have been able to make in this area suggests that the category does really exist. Renouard's copy "en grand papier" of the Johannes Grammaticus of 1527 is now in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. Its paper is too large to have been super-chancery; moreover its watermark is com- pletely different from that of the four other copies of the edition which I have examined. 13 13. See Fahy 2001, p. 277. The possibility cannot be excluded that it is a cut-down royal- paper copy. (3 A ) Royal-paper copies of folio editions These are the copies printed on paper "d'une grandeur exagérée" to which I have already referred. Writing of a copy of the Themistius of 1534, Renouard notes: To give an exact idea of the difference in size between these large copies and those on ordinary paper, I note here that this volume, which I bought from Williams, is 14 inches high by 9 inches 2 lines wide. The Galen which I owned until 1828 was 15 inches 5 lines high by 10 inches 5 lines wide. The greatest height of the ordinary-paper copies of this edition, as also of the Isocrates of 1534, and others of the same period, is 11 ½inches for the best preserved bound copies, 12 inches for the very small number of those which have come down to us in their original condition, that is, without having suffered the binder's knife. All this in mesure de France, ancien pied du roi . 14 14. "Pour donner une exacte idée du rapport de dimension entre ces grands exemplaires et ceux du papier ordinaire, je noterai ici que ce volume, acheté chez Williams, a 14 pouces de haut, sur 9 pouces 2 lignes de largeur. Le Galien che j'ai possédé jusqu'en 1828, a 15 p. 5 l. La plus grande hauteur des papiers ordinaires de ces éditions, ainsi che de l'Isocrate de 1534, et autres de ces mêmes temps, est 11 p. ½pour les volumes reliés, les mieux conservés, et 12 pouces pour le très petit nombre de ceux qui sont parvenus jusqu'à nous dans leur état primitif, c'est-a-dire, sans avoir passé sous le couteau du relieur. Le tout, mesure de France, ancien pied du roi" (p. 111). Translating into metric measurements those given by Renouard (1 inch = 27.06 mm, 1 line = 2.25 mm) we have, for the Themistius, a leaf with dimensions of 379 × 248.5 mm, too tall to have been printed even on median paper. For the Galen the dimensions are bigger still: the size of a leaf of the copy described by Renouard would be 417 × 282 mm. As for the paper used in the smaller copies, an uncut leaf would be 325 mm tall, precisely the height of an uncut sheet of super-chancery. Despite the fact that for his innovative octavo editions, as Paul Needham has shown, Aldus had used sheets of a new size, as tall as median, but less wide, I do not think we need postulate a new paper size for these very large folio copies; the paper used (unless evidence appears to the contrary, of course) was the Bolognese royal, or its Renaissance variant the super-royal. The folio editions with copies on royal paper are discussed in more detail below; here I will only say that those known to me in this category are the same as those mentioned by Renouard, namely the Galen of 1525, the Themistius and Isocrates of 1534 and the Eustratius of 1536. 15 15. For the Galen, the Themistius and the Isocrates see respectively Renouard, pp. 101–102, 111, 111–112; Cataldi Palau, pp. 639–640, 659, 659–670. For the Eustratius see above, n. 4. (3 B ) Royal-paper copies of octavo editions There are numerous Aldine octavo editions published before 1550—almost fifty, according to my information, but the figure is undoubtedly greater than that—which, in addition to copies on narrow median, and in many cases to cop- ies on vellum, also have copies on royal paper. These editions, too, are discussed further below. In his Annales Renouard refers to members of this group as printed "en grand papier"; it seems that he did not realize that the paper used was as tall as the paper "d'une grandeur exagérée" on which the large-paper folio copies were printed. Yet in many copies of these large octavos the leaf height is more than 200 mm, giving a sheet height of at least 400 mm. (4) Copies on blue paper Blue paper was used for engravings before the end of the fifteenth century, but for the printing of books it seems that the earliest examples of its use are those provided by editions of the Aldine press. Renouard records the existence of blue-paper copies of six editions, three quartos (Cato, 1514; Quintilian, 1514; Cato, 1533) and three octavos (Sannazaro, Arcadia , 1514; Petrarch, 1521; Libur- nio 1547). According to Renouard the blue paper used in the three octavos was "en grand papier" (i.e. royal paper), a fact that I have been able to verify only for the Liburnio. 16 16. See Weiss, p. 30; Fletcher, pp. 102–104. Ahmanson-Murphy, p. 115, lists a copy on blue paper of another octavo, the Virgil of 1514 (=1519?); leaf dimensions 144 × 88 mm. H. George Fletcher has kindly drawn my attention to the existence of a further blue-paper copy of this edition in the library of the Stirling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown (see Roeper, p. 14). I am grateful to Susan Roeper for informing me that the leaf dimensions of this copy are 167 × 97 mm. Aldine Folios with Copies on Royal Paper I know of the whereabouts of four royal-paper copies of the 1525 Galen, one in the British Library (G7873, 409 × 260 mm), one in the Cambridge University Library (K.1.1–5, 419 × 257 mm), one in the John Rylands University Library of Manchester (1447, 403 × 277 mm) and one in the Bibliotheque Nationale de France (Rés. T23.55, dimensions of binding 430 × 285 mm); three of the The- mistius of 1534, one in the British Library (C.48.l.2, 421 × 273 mm), one in the library of St Catharine's College, Cambridge (C.I.2, 410 × 272 mm), and one in the John Rylands University Library of Manchester (6950, 410 × 268 mm); and one each of the Isocrates of 1534, in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France (Rés. X.276, 404 × 265 mm), and of the Eustratius of 1536, the copy already men- tioned in the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, Austin, Texas (Uzielli 236, 425 × 270 mm). It is probable that further royal-paper copies of these edi- tions exist in other collections, public and private. But there are also many other surviving copies of these editions, with leaf dimensions which come within the range of median or super-chancery paper. Only by a comparative examination of the papers used can we be sure that these smaller copies are not heavily trimmed versions of the royal-paper group. Unfortunately, I have only been able to examine the copies located in Cambridge and London. I begin therefore with the Themistius of 1534, leaving the 1525 Galen until later. The two royal-paper copies of the Themistius that I have seen are printed al most entirely on two papers, one watermarked with crossed arrows, surmounted by a six-pointed star, the other with a bilateral anchor inscribed in a circle, also surmounted by a six-pointed star, detached from the circle. 17 17. Briquet, I, p. 361, comments that the crossed arrows mark is exclusively Italian, and was used in the middle of the sixteenth century in the manufacture of large paper. I take the terms bilateral and unilateral from Moᘁin (bilateral anchor marks have barbs on each side of the fluke, unilateral marks only on the inside; for digital images of these two types see also Fahy 1999, plates VII–XII). But the dis- position of these two marks in each copy is not identical. In the London copy there are two uninterrupted sequences (A-O and Q,-Y) of each of the two marks, separated by a single gathering (P) whose papers have a third mark, a crossbow inscribed in a circle, surmounted by a cross. In the Cambridge copy this third mark does not appear, only the arrow and the anchor marks, but from gathering N disposed differently from the London copy. Anyone who has examined the paper used in different copies of Aldines of the period will be familiar with this situation; it seems that from time to time the pile of paper placed on the table for the pressman's use in the running off of a sheet could contain a mixture of papers from the stocks in use for that edition, or present in what Paul Needham has called the "blank-paper archive" of the printing-house. 18 18. For example, in the forty-seven copies of the Cortegiano of 1528 whose paper I have examined, only thirty of the sixty-one edition sheets have the same paper in every copy. For the concept of "blank-paper archive" see Needham 2000, p. 4. The three water- marks are large: the arrows and star mark measures 85 × 37 mm, the anchor and star 83 × 47 mm, while the circle inscribing the crossbow is 48 mm in diameter. As for the structure of the formes used in the manufacture of these royal papers, while the average distance between chains is greater than 35 mm (in the case of the arrows and the crossbow papers it approximates to 40 mm), the distance between the chain to which the mark is attached and the two adjacent chains is significantly less. This structure is different from that found in formes used in the manufacture of Venetian super-chancery paper of the period, as we shall see. In addition to these two royal-paper copies, I have examined five other copies of the Themistius with leaf measurements which suggest that they were printed on super-chancery paper. 19 19. They are: BL 72.g.15, 308 × 201 mm; CUL M.2.37, 305 × 211 mm; CUL Cc.9.25, 311 × 204 mm; CUL R*.2.25, 306 × 211 mm; TCC N.5.37, 299 × 198 mm. I have note of the dimensions of three other copies: BLaur D'Elci 700, 300 × 196 mm; BLaur 22.2.17, 298 × 205 mm; UCLA *Z 233 A4T34, 305 × 215 mm; see Centi, p. 559; Ahmanson-Murphy, pp. 193–194. In all these copies the paper is very opaque, making watermark identification difficult; the predominant one seems to be a balance inscribed in a circle, surmounted by two rings, one on top of the other—similar, perhaps identical, to a mark found in paper much used in folio Aldine editions of the period 1527–1528. 20 20. See Fahy 2001, pp. 272–273. What can be clearly seen, however, thanks to the format, is the structure of the forme on which the paper was made, with chains disposed at more or less regular intervals of less than 35 mm for its entire width, and with the watermark placed on one of these chains. 21 21. For super-chancery formes with a similar structure see Fahy 1999, plates I–VI. The paper illustrated in these plates was used in the printing of the definitive edition of Ariosto's Orlando furioso (Ferrara, 1532) and was purchased on Venetian territory, at Salò, near the Toscolano area, a major centre of paper production for the Venetian printing industry. As will be seen, such formes have no tranchefiles, the absence of which, in my experience, is a feature of most Venetian super-chancery papers used in the Aldine press in this period. These differences in forme structure make it easy to decide to which category to assign other copies of this edition. The press completed the printing of the Isocrates of 1534 only two months after that of the Themistius. So it is no surprise to find, in the five copies I have examined, 22 22. They are: BL 72.g.19, 294 × 195 mm; BL 656.d.3, 313 × 205 mm; BL G8517, 307 × 205 mm; CUL W.1.27, 301 × 195 mm; TCC N.5.41, 313 × 213 mm. I have note also of the dimensions of three other copies: BLaur D'Elci 36, 310 × 208; BLaur 22.2.60, 310 × 215 mm; UCLA, *Z 233 A4I85 1534, 308 × 198 mm (see Centi, p. 313; Ahmanson-Murphy, p. 194). the same paper stock with balance watermark as that found in the super-chancery copies of the Themistius, together with another paper water- marked with a six-petalled flower, which regularly occurs in the final gatherings of the edition, and occasionally in a few sheets of the early ones. Like the balance, the six-petalled flower is a watermark which features in Aldine super-chancery folios in the years 1527 and 1528. 23 23. See Fahy 2001, pp. 279–280. The forme used in the fabrication of this paper is similar in structure to that used to make the balance paper described above, with chains regularly occurring at intervals of less than 35 mm, and with the watermark centred on one of the chains. In the six copies of the Eustratius which I have examined 24 24. They are: BL C.19.d.24, 311 × 205 mm; BL 30.f.1, 309 × 204 mm; BL G7846, 316 × 212 mm; CUL M.2.40 l , 298 × 203 mm; CUL Cc.9.32, 308 × 200 mm; TCC N.5.45 l , 292 × 195 mm. I have note also of the dimensions of two other copies: BLaur D'Elci 33, 294 × 196 mm; UCLA *Z 233 A4E92, 317 × 224 mm (see Centi, p. 234; Ahmanson-Murphy, pp. 199–200). there are two new watermarks, an angel inscribed in a circle, with the countermark AI, and a bull's head surmounted by a cinquefoil, also with a countermark, comprising the letter Z and a second letter which I have not succeeded in identifying. The structure of the formes used in the fabrication of these two papers corresponds to that of the balance mark described above. The five-volume edition of Galen (1525) is one of the largest to have been published by the Aldine press, second only in size to the five-volume Aristode of 1495–1498, and, like that edition, presenting for the first time in a single compass, and in the original language, all the works then known or believed to be by their respective authors. The two royal-paper copies of the first volume of the Galen which I have examined are printed on three papers. One, with the watermark of a fleur-de-lys inscribed in a circle, was made on a pair of formes whose structure corresponds to that used in the royal–paper copies of the The- mistius, with intervals between chains varying from 35 mm to 40 mm, except in the vicinity of the watermark, where the interval between the chain to which the mark is attached and the adjacent chains is c.27 mm. But in the other two papers, one with a cardinal's hat mark and the other with a mark which I was not able to identify, the interval between the chains is less than 35 mm and more or less constant, even in proximity to the watermark, as in contemporary Venetian super-chancery paper. Obviously forme structure is not always a decisive element in the identification of royal-paper copies. But the Galen edition also contains another group of copies, clearly identifi- able by paper evidence. In the first volume of these copies three main paper stocks are used. The first two have no watermark, only a countermark, occurring, as is normal in Venetian paper of the period, in the bottom outside corner of the sheet. In one paper the countermark comprises the letter-forms ZM, in the other the single letter-form Z. The twin formes on which these papers were made are easily identifiable by having their countermarks in opposite corners. The third paper is watermarked with a unilateral anchor inscribed in a circle, surmounted by a ring, and accompanied by two countermarks, A and B, which occur in opposite corners of the paper. Here too the twins are easily identifiable by the presence, in the same half of the sheet as the watermark, of one or other of the counter- marks. In all these papers the chains occur at regular intervals of less than 35 mm: indeed in the paper with the ZM countermark the interval is c.30 mm, with a consequent increase in the number of chains. Only the evidence of an uncut copy would establish with certainty the structure of the formes used in making these papers. On the evidence of the six cut copies I have examined it seems that the formes used to make the ZM paper had sixteen chains, on average 30.7 mm apart. Even making no allowance for any distance between the outermost chain and the edge of the forme, it is clear that sheets made on such formes would be at least 460 mm wide. These figures suggest that this group of copies is printed, not on super-chancery, but on median paper (345 × 515 mm). This suggestion is supported both by the leaf dimensions of the copies known to me and by the size of the typepage, which comprises 1+58+1 lines, in comparison with the 1 + 54 + 1 lines of the Themistius and of the other two editions discussed above. 25 25. Leaf dimensions of copies of Volume I known to me are BL.45.i.7,330 × 225 mm; CUL N*.3.5, 337 × 233 mm; CUL PET.D.7.IO, 326 × 231 mm; CUL Path.a.72, 331 × 206 mm; TCG Grylls.11.403, 329 × 217 mm; TGG N.5.20, 337 × 232 mm. The leaf dimensions of Volume I of BLaur D'Elci 158–162 are 332 × 228 mm, and of UCLA Z* 233 A4G13, 339 × 225 mm (see Centi, p. 250; Ahmanson-Murphy, pp. 172–173). All of the editions discused, together with almost all the other folio and quarto editions of Greek texts printed by the Aldine press between 1504 and 1550, use the same type, measuring 89–90 mm for twenty lines; see Ahmanson-Murphy, pp. 22–23, 25 (Gk3, second casting). In one of the median-paper copies of the Galen in the Gambridge University Library (PET D.7.10) the binding has come away from the spine, making it pos- sible to measure the entire inner margin of conjugate leaves (32.5 mm) and thus to establish the space between the two pages of type in the forme (65 mm). Both royal-paper copies of the edition which I have seen are tightly bound, making it impossible to establish an exact figure for the inner margin of the pages, but mea- surements with a thin metal ruler consistently yield a figure less than 32.5 mm. It seems reasonable to suppose that the royal–paper copies were printed using the same imposition of type as that used for the median-paper ones. With an edition of the size of the Galen, comprising 744 edition sheets, it would have needed a disproportionate effort to impose twice each of the 1488 formes, just to print a small number of copies on royal paper. I have no doubt that the same system was used to print all the copies of the other three editions discussed. As we shall see, such was also the case with the two sorts of royal-paper copies of Aldine octavos. One result of this procedure for the folio editions in question was to produce copies with very large margins. In the Austin Eustratius (figure 1) the upper margin measures c.74 mm, the outer c.94 mm and the lower c.120 mm, giving a white space approximately three times the size of the type page. The relation of white to black is smaller in the Galen, the type page being larger than in the other three editions (c.265 × 153 mm, compared to c.245 × 138 mm), but still notable, at approximately two to one. In the smaller-paper copies of these editions, the relationship is approximately one to one, giving the impression of a page full of text. As a rule, large-paper copies are regarded as luxury copies, destined for the bookshelves of the rich and powerful. But in the case of these four editions there is another possibility. All contain rare Greek texts of great cultural weight, destined to be read and consulted by scholars and academics for many decades; in the university and college libraries of Cambridge no fewer than thirty copies of these four editions survive. Perhaps the reason for the printing of royal-paper copies of these editions was to provide copies with wide margins for the use of scholars. 26 26. In this context it is worth noting that vellum copies are recorded of the Eustratius edi- tion; see Renouard, p. 116; Hobson, p. 166, n. 477. As already noted, the module for the type page of the editions of Themistius, Isocrates and Eustratius is 1 + 54 + 1 lines, all printed with the same Greek fount. It was a module often used by Gian Francesco Torresani for the folio edi- tions of Greek texts printed by the Aldine press from 1516 onwards, and constant in the nine such editions published between the 1525 Galen and the Eustratius of 1536. It may be that this group contains other examples of folio editions with copies on royal paper. FIGURE 1. Eustratius of Nicea, Commentaria , 1536, HRHRC Uzielli 236, pp. 86 v –87 r . Aldine Octavos with Copies on Royal Paper Numerous Aldine octavo editions survive with copies on royal paper—nearly fifty, to my knowledge, though this figure is surely too low. Those editions known to me are listed in the Appendix. The date 1550 was chosen as term to keep the research programme within reasonable bounds; undoubtedly the practice of producing octavo editions with royal-paper copies continued at the Aldine press in the second half of the century. The list is divided into two parts because in 1535 the method of printing these copies changed, and with it their external ap- pearance. The list is based in the main on information contained in Renouard's Annales concerning copies which had passed through his hands, or which he had seen in public and private collections; to this material I have added informa- tion from recent catalogues and studies by scholars conscious of the importance for bibliographical research of information concerning leaf dimensions. Where possible, Renouard's information has been checked against copies now in librar- ies open to the public, or in private hands. His few errors are recorded in the notes. With one exception I have only been able to inspect personally royal-paper copies of Aldine octavos now in the British Library. Large-paper copies are in- dicated in the General Catalogue of the British Library by the letters "L.P.", but this indication is not all-inclusive. I found it more expeditious to examine the Aldines included in the books left to the British Museum in 1799 by the Rev. Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode. In terms of quantity, his bequest, numbering about 4,500 printed books, cannot compare with the thousands of incunables and sixteenth-century editions which came to the library in the nineteenth century with the King's Library (1823) and the Grenville Collection (1846), but in terms of quality the Cracherode books are exceptional: seven of the eleven royal-paper copies of Aldine editions which I saw at the British Library have a Cracherode provenance. 27 27. Cracherode's books can be found in the British Library at pressmarks running from 671 … to 688 …, and from C.17 … to C.24…. For Cracherode see Oxford DNB, vol. 13, pp. 909–911 and in the online edition; for the three collections see Harris 1998, pp. 29–32, 207. Royal-paper copies of Aldine octavos can usually be distinguished by their leaf height. The height of a sheet of narrow median is c.350 mm; thus the maximum height of a leaf of an uncut octavo printed on such paper is c.175 mm. Copies of Aldine octavos with leaf heights greater than that have perforce been printed on larger paper. But only from the paper evidence of several copies can one arrive at a clear picture of the edition in question, or at least of its paper element, since many such Aldine octavos also have vellum copies. Thus the Cracherode copy of the 1519 Horace (BL C.19.C.5, 210 × 99 mm) is printed on two papers, one of which has a crossed-arrows watermark, similar to, perhaps identical with, one of the papers found in royal-paper copies of the 1534 Themistius, and the other the watermark of a crossbow inscribed in a circle, surmounted by a fleur-de-lys. Both show the structural features of the royal-paper formes used to produce the Themistius papers, that is, chain intervals in excess of 35 mm, except on either side of the watermark, where the intervals are less. Four other copies of this edi- tion which I have examined (leaf measurements of the largest, 165 × 99 mm) are printed on two papers with different versions of the cardinal's hat mark, one with and one without countermark, and with chains disposed regularly at inter vals of less than 35 mm. The two British Library royal-paper copies of the Virgil of 1514 (1519?) (C.19.C.2, 215 × 102 mm; G9696, 202 × 95 mm), in addition to paper with the crossed-arrows mark, contain a second paper also occurring in the royal-paper copies of the 1534 Themistius, with the watermark of a bilateral anchor inscribed in a circle. However, in the Trinity College Cambridge copy of this edition (Grylls 11.25, 152 × 94 mm) we find only paper with the cardinal's hat mark, with characteristics similar to those of the smaller-paper copies of the 1519 Horace. And only paper evidence can unmask copies originally printed on royal pa- per, but trimmed so severely over time as now to resemble in dimension copies on narrow median. Such is the case of the Cambridge Ausonius of 1517 (CUL Sel.6.55). Despite its present leaf measurements (171 × 97 mm), its origin as a royal-paper copy can be confidently asserted because it is printed from beginning FIGURE 2. Virgil, Opera , 1514 (1519?), BL C.19.c.22, pp. 112 v –113 r . to end on the same crossed-arrows paper used in the royal-paper copies of the 1519 Horace and the 1514 (1519?) Virgil, while four other coppies of the edition which I have examined are printed on two papers with the cardinal's hat mark. The pages of the typical royal-paper Aldine octavo are characterized by the size of the lower margin, which in the Cracherode Virgil of 1514 (1519?) measures 84 mm (figure 2). At the same time, in those belonging to editions published prior to 1535 the outer margin is always narrow, like that of a copy on narrow- median paper. This combination of featuers gives these royal-paper octavos a singular appearance, judged by Renouard "trop allongée et bizarre" (p. 141). But it can be readily explained by supposing that the same formes were used in printing the royal-paper copies and the ordinary-paper ones. Figure 3 shows a sheet of chancery paper printed on one side with the outer forme of an octavo imposition scheme called by Gaskell "common" but which, adopting a terminol- FIGURE 3. Sheet of centripetal octavo, outer forme; Gaskell, fig. 50 (by permission of Oak Knoll Press). ogy suggested by the German bibliographer Martin Boghardt, I prefer to call centripetal. This is the imposition scheme used to print Aldine octavos until 1536; subsequently, until the mid 1550s, the press used the centrifugal scheme (Gaskell's "inverted"), with pages 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the inside of the forme. 28 28. See Gaskell, figures 50 and 51. For Boghardt's terminology see Hornschuch, pp. 22–25. Boghardt objects to Gaskell's terminology because it begs the question of the historical relationship between the two schemes. His own terms are purely descriptive. Scant documentation is available on the use of octavo imposition schemes in sixteenth-century Italian printing; what little there is suggests that in this period Gaskell's "inverted" scheme was no less common than his "common" scheme; see Fahy 1994 and 1995. As far as sixteenth-century Ital- ian printing is concerned, Gaskell is wrong in suggesting (p. 106, note C) that sheets printed on formes using the "inverted" scheme were perfected by turning them on their longer axis. In this diagram the rectangle surrounding the sheet represents (approximately) the outlines of a sheet of royal paper, centred on the forme. If this sheet is printed on formes imposed thus, all the leaves will have large lower margins, but only ff. 1, 2, 3 and 4 will also have large outer margins. The outer margins of the other four leaves will be limited to half the distance between the pages of type in the forme. Without some intervention in the printing house a copy consisting of sheets printed thus would not be viable. The answer was to trim the large outer FIGURE 4. Cicero, Epistolae ad Atticum , 1540, BL Davis 763, pp. 184 v –185 r . margins so as to reduce them to the same width as the small ones, an operation which must have been done prior to binding, and was probably done prior to printing, to facilitate the folding of the sheet. 29 29. This possibility was hinted at many years ago by Foxon, p. 173, who suggested that these large copies of Aldine octavos "are printed from the normal imposition of type on a square sheet of paper, giving very deep bottom margins." That the sheet of royal paper was centred on the forme is shown by the position of its watermarks, fragments of which, when vis- ible, are found in the leaves positioned on the outside of the formes. In the royal-paper copies of the 1519 Horace the mispagination of the outer forme of gathering m, an error not present in the narrow-median copies, suggests that the larger copies of this edition were run off before the smaller ones. For editions published from 1535 onwards the procedure was different. The royal-paper copies of these editions are as tall as those of an earlier date, but the outer margin of each leaf is greater. While for editions prior to 1535 the maximum outer margin width of copies in our list is 102 mm, for those after that date it is 134 mm, a feature which gives these copies a more normal appearance (figure 4). At the same time, from the position of the type page it is clear that here too the royal-paper copies were printed from the same imposition of type as that used for copies on smaller paper. But obviously the method of producing these large copies had changed. What this method was was demonstrated more than twenty years ago by the Belgian scholars Jean-François Gilmont and Émile van Balberghe. Having examined the royal-paper copy of Paulus Manutius's Commentarius on Cicero's letters Ad Atticum (1547) which once belonged to Ren- ouard, they pointed out that the second of the two suggestions he had advanced to explain how this copy had been produced—namely that it had been printed on half-sheets of royal paper—could be demonstrated by a detail which had escaped him. This was the presence of a pinhole towards the bottom of the in- ner margin of ff. 1, 2, 3 and 4 of each gathering. 30 30. See Renouard, pp. 140–141; Gilmont, pp. 49–54. The copy in question is now in the Ahmanson-Murphy collection in California (entry 45 in our list). Their article was illustrated by several diagrams, one of which is reproduced here, with their kind permis- sion (figure 5). Superimposed on the image of an octavo forme intended for the printing of chancery paper are the outlines of a half-sheet of royal paper, with the pins represented by black spots. Comparing figures 3 and 5, one can see that with the second system the outer margin of the inner leaves of royal-paper copies (in this case ff. 1, 2, 3 and 4, the press having adopted in the meantime the centrifugal octavo imposition scheme) could be as wide as the entire distance between the pages of type in the forme, thus doubling their width with respect to the earlier system. It would still have been necessary to trim the sides of the sheet before printing, but not so drastically as in the earlier system. Pinholes are visible towards the bottom of the inner margin of the first four leaves of each gather- ing of the three royal-paper copies of Aldine octavos from this period which I have examined in the British Library, thus confirming the general applicability of Gilmont's and Van Balberghe's reconstruction. In copies of Aldine octavos of this second period the presence of pinholes provides an additional clue to their origin as royal-paper copies. Indeed, the holes can still be visible even when the copy has been so heavily trimmed as not to be recognizable as a royal-paper copy from its leaf height. 31 31. See entry 38 in our list, where the leaf height is only 170 mm. I am grateful to Neil Harris for examining this copy for me. To form a gathering of a royal-paper octavo printed on half-sheets in the way described, a method of folding is required commonly used in Italy in the first years of printing for quartos in eights, in which the two half-sheets are folded together, with the sheet containing f. 1 on the outside, and with the first fold along the short axis, forming a gathering in which the two conjugate leaves of the second half-sheet are positioned between, and not after, the two conjugate leaves of the first. 32 32. For quartos in eights folded in this way see Hellinga, p. 11; Zappella, p. 121, fig. 33. The date 1514, that of the first instance which I have been able to document of an Aldine octavo with royal-paper copies, shows that the practice goes back to the days of the great Aldus. In his Supplément aux listes chronologiques Renouard reports (p. 484) that Samuel Butler, Bishop of Lichfield (1774–1839), had once had "à sa disposition", but without apparently acquiring it, a copy "en grand papier" of the Euripides of 1503. If this was a royal-paper copy, it would be the FIGURE 5. Half-sheet of royal, superimposed on outer forme of centrifugal octavo; Gilmont, fig. VIII. only instance known to me of such a copy of a Greek octavo. 33 33. I have not been able to investigate a copy of the 1517 edition of Oppian, De piscibus , in Latin and Greek, in the library of the Earl of Leicester, Holkham Hall, Norfolk, which, as the Earl's librarian, D. P. Mortlock, kindly informs me, has a binding height of 178 mm. More promising is Renouard's reference to the appearance in a sale catalogue of a copy of the 1509 Horace "de cette forme allongée par le bas, dont on connoît plusieurs autres éditions Aldines de ces mêmes temps". 34 34. See Renouard, p. 57. The sale catalogue is Catalogo della biblioteca della ch. me. di monsignore Natale Saliceti , Rome, 1789. I am grateful to Neil Harris for transcribing the entry therein concerning the 1509 Horace. The relevant part reads: "Exemplar nitidum in majori, &amp; solidiori charta excusum, formaque oblonga praeditum from which it will be seen that Renouard's description is an interpretation rather than a translation of the original. An ele- ment of doubt persists because, in comparison with the octavos of other printers, early Aldine octavos on narow-median paper could also be described as "forma oblonga"; see Needham 1994, pp. 302–305. Many of the Aldine octavos with royal- paper copies published between 1514 and 1541 also have vellum copies. The in- formation given here on this point is surely incomplete: even in the course of the relatively limited research which it was possible to undertake in the preparation of this article a vellum copy came to light of the 1514 (1519?) Virgil (CUL SSS.39.8), an edition of which, according to Renouard, "on ne connoît aucun exemplaire sur vélin" (p. 69). One of the explanations offered for the Greek royal-paper folios of 1525–1536, namely that they were provided with large margins for the use of scholars, is much less plausible when applied to the royal-paper octavos. More likely is that the latter were intended as special copies for discerning readers, less expensive than vellum copies, but still in their way extra-ordinary. It is probably no coincidence that the change in the shape of royal-paper Aldine octavos took place at the time when Aldus's third son, Paulus, was assuming control of the press, leaving his Torresani relations to operate as publishers and booksellers. And this change may, in its turn, have been due to Paulus's intention to mark his arrival at the helm of his father's press by the presentation to important person- ages of beautifully bound copies of his earliest publications, beginning with the octavo Pliny of 1535–1536 and continuing with the series of octavo editions of Cicero's works edited by Paulus, which the press published in 1540 and 1541. For these presentation copies he may well have wanted a book less "bizarre" in appearance than the earlier Aldine royal-paper octavos. 35 35. For the bindings see Hobson, pp. 113–116, and Brooker, passim and ff. 1–15. They were largely the work of the greatest binder active in Venice at that time, called by Hobson the "Mendoza Binder" because of the numerous bindings carried out for Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, Imperial Ambassador to Venice from 1539 to 1546, and tentatively identified by him as Andrea di Lorenzo of Verona. Even from these incomplete data it is possible to draw some provisional conclusions concerning the production of royal-paper Aldine octavos. From the beginning many octavo editions comprised more than one type of copy. For the earliest editions we have reliable information only of copies on narrow-median paper and on vellum. 36 36. In need of checking are Renouard's comments on octavos from 1501 onwards printed "sur papier fort" or "sur beau papier fort". The results of a survey of the paper used in a few copies of the 1501 Martial, the 1502 Dante and the 1503 Greek Anthology—all editions which Renouard claims contain copies of this sort (indeed, in the case of the Greek Anthology, was printed in its entirety on this sort of paper)—cast doubt on the objectivity of these remarks: Martial, three copies examined (BL C.4.f.2; C.19.b.4; CUL Sel.6.45), twenty-four sheets, all of the same paper, unwatermarked, but with the countermark A, placed between two chains; Dante, four copies examined (CUL CCE.1.1; Norton d.185; Young 253; Sel.6.20), thirty and a half sheets, twenty-nine of which are watermarked with a balance inscribed in a circle, with a cinquefoil countermark, plus one sheet of the same paper as that used in the Martial; Greek Anthology, four copies examined (BL 672.a.1; C.4.C.8; TCC M.12.17; M.12.18), thirty-seven sheets, all of the same paper as that used in the Martial. But before the death of Aldus two other types of copies appear, those on royal paper and those on blue paper. For the 1514 Arcadia ex- amples of all four types are known to survive. The success, or at least the succès d'estime , of the first group of octavo classics—a risky initiative, in which Aldus had invested heavily—must have convinced the press to continue to offer readers alternatives to the copies on narrow-median paper, but of more than one sort. The positioning of the pinholes on leaves 1–4 of the second series of Aldine royal-paper octavos suggests that the same tympan, and probably therefore the same press, was used for narrow-median and royal-paper copies; I assume that this practice was also adopted for the earlier series. Despite the likelihood of further instances coming to light of Aldine octavo editions with copies on royal paper, it would seem, on the evidence at present available, that not all Aldine octavos printed between 1501 and 1550 contained such copies. Given the attention devoted for centuries by scholars, collectors and librarians to the first group of octavo editions, those printed between 1501 and 1505, it is significant that no sure information is available about the existence of royal-paper copies of these editions. Leaving aside the Sannazaro of 1514, in our list the editions published before 1535 form two chronologically distinct groups, those published between 1517 and 1522 (fourteen) and those published in 1533 and 1534 (nine). Yet in the first of these periods the press published a total of forty-two octavo editions, and it published another thirteen between 1522 and 1528, a period for which we do not know of a single example of an octavo edition with royal-paper copies. In 1533 and 1534 it published a total of twelve octavo editions; perhaps the three editions of this period in which royal-paper copies have not been found (Petrarch, 1533; Pontanus, Carmina , 1533; Poetae tres , 1534) would provide a good starting-point for further work. 37 37. In a letter to Paulus Manutius, dated 3 November 1535, the Benedictine monk On- orato Fascitelli writes of a consignment of copies of the octavo edition of Sannazaro's Latin works (September 1535) sent to him at Rome by the Aldine press. The consignment contained a few copies which Fascitelli describes as being on median paper ("in carta mezzana"), much sought after by their Roman friends ( Lettere , pp. 348–349). Between 1535 and 1550 the firm, adapting itself to prevailing trends in the Venetian publishing industry, increased substantially its production of octavo editions of vernacular works, but these, some forty in number, are poorly represented in our list. At the moment it is not possible to say whether the practice of printing royal- paper copies of editions of which the main print-run was on smaller paper was yet another of Aldus's innovations. While there are many fifteenth-century edi- tions with vellum as well as paper copies, none is known with copies printed on paper of different sizes. The practice seems to have originated, at least as far as Italy is concerned, in the early years of the sixteenth century. But there is already evidence to show that it was not exclusive to the Aldine press. At some time between 1504 and 1517 there appeared a quarto edition of Sannazaro's Arcadia , based textually on the Neapolitan princeps of 1504. The edition has no date, printer's name or place of publication, but on the basis of its types has been attributed by F. J. Norton to Bernardino dei Vitali, a printer active from time to time in Venice between 1495 and 1539, but who also printed in other centres, including Rome. Norton's copy, now in Cambridge (CUL Norton c.66), with leaf dimensions of 205 × 130 mm, consistent with its having been printed on chancery paper, uses for the most part paper with two different versions of the balance wa- termark. 38 38. On Bernardino dei Vitali see Norton, pp. 62, 160–161; Ascarelli and Menato 1989, p. 336. The edition is also described, on the basis of four copies in Italian libraries, in Villani, p. 16; all are on paper with the balance watermark, like the Cambridge copy. Villani claims that the types used are identical to those of the 1504 princeps ; in fact, the two fonts are different, as can be seen by the treatment of the group "Qu", rendered by a ligature in the princeps , and by two distinct typographical characters in the anonymous edition. But in the British Library there is another copy (BL 81.h.16; figure 6), with leaf dimensions of 278 × 202 mm, and large outer and lower margins FIGURE 6. Jacopo Sannazaro, Arcadia , after 1504, BL 81.h.16, sig. B1 r . (100 mm and 111 mm respectively), printed on paper most of which has the wa- termark of a ladder in a circle; from its size this paper is clearly royal paper. The position of the type page in the London copy shows that the type was imposed for the chancery paper copies and the same imposition was used for royal-paper copies, as in the Aldine editions. Evidence has also come to light recently of the existence towards the end of our period of royal-paper copies of an octavo edition not printed by the Aldine press. Dr Sara Centi kindly informs me that she has found in the Biblioteca Comunale of San Gimignano a royal-paper copy of the Carmina quinque illustrium poetarum , a chancery octavo edition published in Venice in 1548 by Vincenzo Valgrisi. The copy has leaf dimensions of 193 × 120 mm; it also has pinholes in the lower margin of the first four leaves of each gathering, just as in the royal-paper copies of Aldine octavos of the same period. It is likely that other royal-paper copies of Italian sixteenth-century chancery editions, Aldine and oth- ers, await discovery in the many Italian libraries with sixteenth-century holdings, most of which are without published catalogues, and without specific information, even within the library itself, about the leaf dimensions of individual copies. Conclusion Returning to our point of departure, the folio Cortegiano of 1528, it is now clear that in April 1527, when Castiglione wrote to his factor Cristoforo Ti- rabosco with details of the edition he wished the Aldine press to publish, there were already many Aldine editions with royal-paper copies, a fact of which he was doubtless aware. However, as far as our present knowledge goes, with a single exception they were all octavos. This exception was the monumental folio edition in five volumes of the works of Galen, a classic of ancient culture which was still fundamental in the practice of Renaissance medicine. Castiglione's pro- posal concerned something completely different, the first edition of a new work in the vernacular, which in the rich history of the Aldine press had few precedents, the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili of 1499, Bembo's Asolani (1505) and Le vulgari elo- quentie of Niccolò Liburnio (1521). Nevertheless, in the counter-proposal of the Aldine press, reported to the author in November 1527 in a letter from Tirabosco which has only recently come to light, the possibility of including in the print run copies on royal paper is not specifically excluded, and Castiglione was certainly expecting them when he wrote to his factor again in April 1528, after the edition had been published. 39 39. For Tirabosco's letter of November 1527 see Bertolo, pp. 136–137; Quondam, pp. 539–540. The counter-proposal of the press involved doubling the print-run to 2000, and assuming the whole financial burden of the edition (instead of the fifty-fifty arrangement origi- nally suggested by Castiglione), except for 130 copies, which were to be at the expense of the author. In Castiglione's letter of April 1528 he wrote that he was expecting 100 copies, including thirty on royal paper (Quondam, 542–543). Whatever the eventual print run of the Cortegiano , the counter-proposal of the press is extremely interesting in illustrating what it thought was an appropriate size for this rather experimental edition. The strongest evidence that the eleven copies in our survey printed on different paper are indeed heavily trimmed royal-paper copies comes from the paper itself, which exhibits the features which we can now recognize as characteristic of Venetian royal paper of this period. It has a large anchor water- mark (74 × 51 mm in one twin; 73 × 48 mm in the other) and intervals of 35 mm or more between chains, except on either side of the mark, where the intervals are c.30 mm. The implications are evident: while it would be an exaggeration to describe the information set forth in this article as the tip of an iceberg, it seems likely that other instances of Aldine editions with royal-paper copies lie hidden, awaiting the bibliographer aware of the importance of a thorough bibliographi- cal analysis of multiple copies.

They witness to the continuation in the Aldine press after 1550 of the practice of printing royal-paper copies of octavo editions.

PRINTING THE FAERIE QUEENE IN 1590 by Andrew Zurcher * * I could not have begun, carried on with, or completed this research without the work of F. R. Johnson and of Hiroshi Yamashita, Haruo Sato, Toshiyuki Suzuki, and Akira Takano to guide me. I have on many points contested their evidence or interpretations, but I have remained indebted to them throughout. For suggestions and comments on work related to this article, I am grateful to Colin Burrow, David Lee Miller, Wayne Erickson, Elizabeth Fowler, Tom Lockwood, Jason Scott-Warren, Ian Gadd, and to my sister Amelia Zurcher. When Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene went into publication for the first time in 1590, it was the largest work of English poetry ever seen through the press by a living author. Spenser apparently had some experience of printing-house proofing, garnered during what appears to have been a carefully- organized printing, by Hugh Singleton, of the first edition of The Shepheardes Calender in 1579; 1 1. The most thorough general treatment of the printing of The Shepheardes Calender in 1579 is still H. J. Byrom, 'Edmund Spenser's First Printer, Hugh Singleton', The Library, 4th ser., 14 (1933), 121–156; the uneventful bibliographical analysis of F. R. Johnson, in A Critical Bibliog- raphy of the Works of Edmund Spenser Printed Before 1700 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1933), pp. 2–3, provides a useful technical supplement. The woodcut blocks used in all contemporary editions of The Shepheardes Calender were analyzed by Ruth Samson Luborsky, 'The Illustrations to The Shepheardes Calender', Spenser Studies , 2 (1981), 3–53; and idem, 'The Illustrations to The Shepheardes Calender. II', Spenser Studies, 9 (1991), 249–253. but the pressures of producing The Faerie Queene —so far sur- mounting Spenser's earlier verse as epic, in generic terms, towers over pastoral— must have been immense. Although the layout of The Shepheardes Calender had been somewhat complex, including a range of prefatory materials, a woodcut and 'argument' at the head of every eclogue, and a 'glosse or scholion' attached to the back of each eclogue, the sheer personal stakes of the proper presentation of the first instalment of Spenser's epic made this the riskier venture. In 1579, Spenser had been a young man, personal secretary to John Young, Bishop of Rochester, recently graduated with an MA from Cambridge, and with a promising career ahead of him; by 1590, he had been living ten years in Ireland, during which time he had published no further poetry, had retired from the comparative bustle of Dublin to the anonymity of Kilcolman, near Cork, and had apparently lost most of his once-promising patronage connections: Philip Sidney (d. 1586), Arthur Lord Grey of Wilton (back in England from 1582), and the Earl of Leicester (d. 1588). Spenser's return to public notice in 1590, with the advertisement of a new patronage connection to Walter Ralegh, and—above all—his favorable re- ception by Queen Elizabeth upon presentation of a manuscript copy of The Faerie Queene (and himself?) at court, gave him a new opportunity to secure his status as 'England's arch-Poët'. It was an opportunity that he could not afford to lose. With this in mind, the 1590 edition of The Faerie Queene stands out, from one perspective, as a landmark example of a poet experimenting with print pa- tronage conventions in an innovatory and ambitious way: the volume originally contained a dedication to Queen Elizabeth seven commendatory poems, ten dedicatory sonnets to aristocratic patrons, and an epistle from Spenser to Ralegh giving important context for 'the Authors … whole intention in the course of this worke'; the number of dedicatory sonnets to court and government lumi- naries was later augmented to seventeen. The barrage of dedications and com- mendations, alongside an open acknowledgment of the support of the queen and the intimacy of her principal favorite, would seem a bravado display of a poet's achievement. From another perspective, though, the 1590 edition of The Faerie Queene almost looks like a critique, even a burlesque, of the contemporary culture of literary patronage. The proliferation of dedicatory sonnets, especially in the revised state, makes any one seem superfluous (in the spirit of the motto from 'September' of The Shepheardes Calender: inopem me copia fecit ), and simply by its mass seems to outweigh what must have been the primary dedication to the eponymous Gloriana, Elizabeth. In addition, all of the prefatory mate- rial appears not at the front of the volume, but at the back—except for the dedication to Elizabeth which was thrust, perhaps hastily and probably disre- spectfully, into the only available space in the first gathering, the verso of the title page. Modern scholars have often debated the poetics, politics, and printer's exi- gencies that might have led Spenser, or his publisher William Ponsonby, or his printer John Wolfe, to lay out the prefatory matter in this final (mostly terminal) form. 2 2. See, for example, David Lee Miller, The Poem's Two Bodies: The Poetics of the 1590 Faerie Queene (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1988); Joseph Loewenstein, 'Spenser's Retrography: Two Episodes in Post-Petrarchan Bibliography', in Spenser's Life and the Subject of Biography, ed. Judith H. Anderson, Donald Cheney, and David A. Richardson (Amherst: Univ. of Mas- sachusetts Press, 1996), pp. 99–130; Carol A. Stillman, 'Politics, Precedence, and the Order of the Dedicatory Sonnets in The Faerie Queene', Spenser Studies, 5 (1985), 143–148; Jean R. Brink, 'Materialist History of the Publication of The Faerie Queene', Review of English Studies, n.s. 54 (2003), 1–26; and Wayne Erickson, ed., The 1590 Faerie Queene : Front to Back, Studies in the Literary Imagination, 38:2 (2005), passim. Some readers have supposed that Spenser had always intended his prefa- tory material for placement at the back of the volume, answering the title page (and the royal dedication) at the front of the volume in the same way a plural body politic mirrors its single head and ruler. Others have supposed that Spens- er's hand was forced by the unanticipated interest and patronage of the queen, and that he had to devise a suitable format to accommodate existing debts of patronage without insulting his royal patron or jeopardizing the newly-awarded annuity (confirmed by patent in January 1591 at £50 p.a.) that she had promised him. 3 3. The annual pension of  50 appears in the Calendar of the Patent Rolls preserved in the Public Record Office (London: H.M.S.O., 1891–1982) for 33 Elizabeth. Still others have suggested that the final arrangement was dictated not by Spenser, but by Wolfe who, as an experienced printer and a very efficient and perhaps impatient businessman, received the collection of dedicatory materials too late to incorporate them into the opening gathering. These interpretations have been variously cumbered and supported by the inter-dependence of the decisions taken by Spenser or Wolfe regarding the first and last gatherings. The decision to place the title page on the recto of the first leaf of the opening gather- ing, A1, and to begin the text of the proem to Book 1 on the recto of A2, must have coincided with the decision to relegate any prefatory material to the back of the volume (in a full, two-sheet gathering eventually signed Pp), as Wolfe would presumably never have planned to insert a mis-paginated eight-leaf gathering of prefatory materials between A1 and A2. The need to place a dedication to the queen at the front of the volume would seem the obvious, and perhaps the only, reason to have displaced the prefatory material, and yet copies of the 1590 edition survived without the dedication to Elizabeth: 4 4. For speculation on the number of such copies surviving into the twentieth century, see F. R. Johnson, A Critical Bibliography of the Works of Edmund. Spenser Printed Before 1700, p. 15. the royal dedication was inserted on A1 v as a stop-press correction to the inner forme of the outer sheet of A. Finally, Spenser prevailed upon Wolfe to run off a single-sheet gathering, Qq, containing seven additional dedicatory sonnets, to replace Pp6-7, perhaps immediately upon 'completion' of the printing, or sometime reasonably shortly thereafter. For a publication for which Spenser might have been supposed to have taken especial care, the bibliographical record seems to tell a story of ac- cident, confusion, and revisions—a story that has amply admitted of a range of scholarly interpretations. But if modern observers have been interested in the way Spenser handled, or mis-handled, his dedications in 1590, at least one contemporary observer seems to have found the whole business interesting, and of substantial explana- tory power as a critique of the contemporary culture of literary patronage. As I have argued elsewhere, Thomas Nashe furnished in his 1592 satire, Pierce Peni- lesse His Supplication to the Diuell, a stinging parody of the printing of The Faerie Queene in 1590 as a publishing event. 5 5. Andrew Zurcher, 'Getting it Back to Front in 1590: Spenser's Dedication, Ralegh's Equivocation, and Nashe's Insinuation', Studies in the Literary Imagination, 38 (2005), 173–198. Nashe has many targets in his satire, but the ad hominem invective is aimed above all at the cause of precise Protestants (non-conforming ministers, and their Puritan followers), their now-dead cham- pion Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, and the man who had seemed to be tak- ing up Leicester's old precisian clients, Walter Ralegh. Ralegh's star had fallen disastrously in the late spring of 1592, when his clandestine marriage to Bess Throckmorton was advertised to the Queen and made court gossip; by the time Nashe produced Pierce Penilesse in September 1592, Ralegh had been committed to the Tower. Pierce's patronage project—a scholar's desperate, Faustian turn to the succour of the devil—combines Nashe's vitriolic contempt for Ralegh with a series of parodic emulations of Spenser's layout of the 1590 edition of The Faerie Queene, above all in repeated references to a collection of dedicatory sonnets (all of them addressed to die dead) that Pierce, or perhaps Nashe, intends to deliver to the devil, or the printer, to be inserted 'at the latter end' of his supplication. In a lengthening string of insinuations, backhanded compliments, and explicit criticisms, Nashe and his printers Richard Jones (first edition) and Abel Jeffes (later editions) re-imagine the 1590 Faerie Queene as a physical witness to the same fissures in print patronage politics that eventually caused both Spenser's disgrace, upon the suppression of Complaints in 1591, and Ralegh's fall from power. 6 6. For a contemporary witness to the 'calling-in' of Spenser's 1591 book, Complaints, Con- taining sundrie small poemes of the worlds vanitie (London: William Ponsonby, 1591), see Richard S. Peterson, 'Laurel Crown and Ape's Tail: New Light on Spenser's Career from Sir Thomas Tresham', Spenser Studies, 12 (1998), 1–36. Tresham is particularly concerned in his letter to Lewes, Lord Mordaunt to note the dedicatees of Spenser's popular satirical poems, suggest- ing that the sensitivities excited by the volume's publication concerned not merely the poems themselves, but the way they were applied to particular patrons. Nashe's decision to sharpen his satire of Spenser and Wolfe in the second edition of Pierce Penilesse —which included a new preface harping satirically on the printing of The Faerie Queene in 1590, and on Spenser's disgrace in 1591—may have been in part personal. His printer for the second and subsequent editions, Abel Jeffes, had during the summer of 1592 become the target of a sustained enquiry by the Stationers' Company, during which its beadle, John Wolfe, repeatedly sought the support of the Archbishop of Canterbury to compel Jeffes' submission to search. See Harry R. Hoppe, 'John Wolfe, Printer and Publisher, 1579–1601', The Library, 4th ser., 14 (1933), 241–289 (pp. 264–265). Nashe concludes Pierce Penilesse with an explicit discussion of Spenser's own dedicatory sonnets, in which he accuses Spenser of some act of 'forgetfulnes' while himself celebrating the projected rise of a new literary and political patron, Ferdinando Stanley, Lord Strange. Nashe's sustained and often precise parody of Spenser seems to locate the source of Spenser's eventual disgrace and patronage fiasco of 1591 in the printing event of the 1590 edition of The Faerie Queene. The repeated emphasis in die early prefaces and the final episde of Pierce Penilesse on the sonnets Nashe intended to append to its 'latter end'—sonnets that Nashe does not send because, he claims, he is kept prisoner by the plague in the country—suggests that the communi- cations between Spenser and Wolfe broke down in 1590, and that this might somehow have been connected to Spenser's unusual disposal of his prefatory material, and in turn to his later patronage problems. Nashe's parodic account gives us some sense of the reception of Spenser's volume, and the scuttlebutt that surrounded its publication in the years after it appeared; but it is much harder to know whether the layout of the volume reflected Spenser's intentions in the first place, and what those intentions might have been. The bibliographical evidence has, to date, resisted explanation: when and why Spenser or Wolfe decided to move the dedicatory sonnets to the back of the volume, when and why they decided to print the title page to the work in gathering A, when and why they added the dedication to Elizabeth on the verso of the title page, when and why the number of dedicatory sonnets was expanded—these related questions, the answers to which would give us some purchase on Spenser's intentions behind his layout, have seemed unanswerable. Scholarly work attempting to interpret the layout of the 1590 edition of The Faerie Queene has proceeded in the absence of the very bibliographical evidence the interpretation of which ought to provide its basis. This paper returns, in light of Nashe's insinuations about Spenser's or Wolfe's misjudgments in 1590, to the bibliographical evidence, attempting to provide a sounder footing on which to judge Spenser's intentions for the layout of his most important publication. As Nashe's jibes suggest, the story of the printing of The Faerie Queene in 1590 is likely more complicated, and more revealing, than bibliographers have, to date, led us to believe. A View of The Faerie Queene in 1590: F. R. Johnson and Yamashita et al. The meticulous and enduring work of F. R. Johnson on the printing of the 1590 edition of The Faerie Queene has never been significantly challenged, and the picture he first described of the printing process in Wolfe's shop has remained the dominant view; recent expansions of, and some adjustments to, his analysis have been supplied by Hiroshi Yamashita et al., particularly touching composito- rial practice in the edition. 7 7. See F. R. Johnson, A Critical Bibliography of the Works of Edmund Spenser Printed Before 1700, pp. 11–18; and Hiroshi Yamashita et al., A Textual Companion to The Faerie Queene 1590 (Tokyo: Kenyusha, 1993), especially the appendices. Ponsonby may have chosen Wolfe, with whom he had never worked before, because Wolfe was an efficient printer with a considerable capacity and Spenser's was a job with a tight timetable; 8 8. The best general treatment of Wolfe's printing career is still Harry R. Hoppe, 'John Wolfe, Printer and Publisher, 1579–1601'. See also Ian Gadd, 'John Wolfe, bookseller and printer', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 2004); I am grate- ful to Ian Gadd for private comments on Wolfe's career. For an interpretation of the intellec- tual property concerns developing out of Wolfe's battle with the Stationers' Company in the 1580s—concerns that might well have suggested Wolfe to Ponsonby's or Spenser's notice for this job, and certainly advertised his reputation and capacity—see Joseph Loewenstein, 'For a History of Literary Property: John Wolfe's Reformation', English Literary Renaissance, 18 (1988), 389–412. Wolfe had in 1586 also printed, for John Harrison the younger, the most recent edition of Spenser's The Shepheardes Calender. Ponsonby was developing a good relationship with John Windet at about this date, but the latter may have been tied up printing Sidney's Arcadia , and his shop did not have Wolfe's resources. Situated from 1588 in Sta- tioners' Hall, with four presses, a team of experienced and apparently very able compositors, and an ample stock of type and paper, Wolfe could offer fast and reliable publication—his bilingual edition of Castiglione's The Courtier, like the line of works by Machiavelli that he produced with false imprints, was published to an exacting, and probably very expeditious, standard. As Johnson's discus- sion of Wolfe's printing of The Faerie Queene demonstrates, and as the analysis of compositional practice undertaken by Yamashita et al. has confirmed, the work was parcelled up very precisely, and printed by an organized team with remark- able consistency at what appears to have been a clip—so fast, it may be, that Spenser did not have time to gather his thoughts about the dedicatory, commen- datory, and epistolary material he had perhaps intended, though printed last, to be bound at the front of the volume. 9 9. The tradition that The Faerie Queene was printed quickly has until recently been just that—no more than an unsubstantiated tradition. The terminus a quo has usually been taken to be the prefatory letter to Walter Ralegh eventually affixed to the poem, dated 23 Janu- ary 1589 (presumably new style, which Spenser tended to favor in other contexts, and par- ticularly in his secretarial work), and that ad quem the end of the calendar year 1590, which given the imprint date, as well as the awarding of a royal annuity in February 1591, seems very likely. On the other hand, a recent manuscript discovery suggests that the first three books of the poem were in a final form (if not the final form of the 1590 edition) in 1588, and Abraham Fraunce quotes from the text in his The Arcadian Rhetorike of that year; see Joseph Black, '"Pan is Hee": Commending The Faerie Queene', Spenser Studies, 15 (2001), 121–124, and D. Allen Carroll, 'The 1588 MS Commendation to The Faerie Queene', Spenser Studies, 16 (2002), 105–123. But as I will demonstrate below, there is good reason to think that the evidence of the 1590 printed book itself points to a single, continuous, and expeditious print- ing of the volume; and this is a point to which, at the conclusion of the present article, I will return. Johnson's basic outline of the organization of the work is almost certainly correct. Wolfe had four presses at this date, but he appears to have used only two of them to produce The Faerie Queene. It is a given that a printer as experienced and shrewd as Wolfe would have maintained a steady flow of production on his presses; to keep the Spenser job going, Wolfe's compositors and press-men used a system of four skeleton-formes, where two skeleton-formes were being printed at any given time while the other two skeleton-formes were being set. The running- titles in these four skeleton-formes were exactly retained (with a few very impor- tant exceptions) throughout the 600-page job. 10 10. D. F. McKenzie's learned and important argument in 'Printers of the Mind' notwith- standing, it seems probable that F. R. Johnson's hypothesis—of a group of compositors setting the entire text of the Spenser's poem with four skeleton-formes on two presses—is broadly cor- rect. See 'Printers of the Mind: Some Notes on Bibliographical Theories and Printing-House Practices', Studies in Bibliography, 22 (1969), 1–75; repr. in Making Meaning: "Printers of the Mind" and Other Essays, ed. Peter D. McDonald and Michael F. Suarez, S.J. (Amherst: Univ. of Mas- sachusetts Press, 2002), pp. 13–85. As Johnson demonstrated and Yamashita et al. confirmed (a position I will further corroborate and amplify at various points below), the printing of the volume was exceedingly regular, with the four nearly invariable skeleton-formes employed in a consistent system and the compositors assigned to consistent stints from the earliest stages of the project straight through to the end. Given the special nature of the text as a stanzaic poem—easily cast off and straightforwardly set, but requiring custom indentation—it seems that the volume might have been securely set at speed, and that there were clear efficiency gains to be had from doing so. That the printing was a commission from the publisher and bookseller William Ponsonby, rather than Wolfe's own venture, may have constrained his scheduling. It is important to recognize that a general acceptance of Johnson's hypothesis does not rule out concurrent printing on either press, especially of ephemera, or suggest that both formes of the inner sheet always went to one press and those of the outer to another (though this seems likely to have been the practice), or that the same two (of Wolfe's four) presses were used throughout the job. Because the edition was printed as a quarto in 8s, each (two-) press stint produced half a gathering, running off the full complement of one side of one sheet each; when the second set of skel- eton-formes was completed and locked in the press, the sheets were perfected, producing the full complement of a two-sheet gathering: 8 leaves (16 pages). As Johnson noticed, the type from a completed forme was then redistributed at the same time that the chase was re-dressed, so that the compositor could use the single available signature on each skeleton-forme as a guide for the layout of the pages on the next forme: the absolute regularity of this method, Johnson ar- gued, meant that the skeleton-formes were not reversed, even once, throughout the entire printing. 11 11. In fact, there was one case of skeleton-forme inversion, after the printing of gathering Bb; see below, pp. 132–133. The collation of the edition up to the original final gathering (Pp), which was altered after the printing had been concluded, is regular: 4 o in 8s: A 8 -Pp 8 . This was subsequently modified to incorporate the four-leaf cancel- lans, producing the final collation: A 8 -Oo 8 Pp 8 (-Pp6,7; Pp5 + Qq 4 ). There are a few comparatively minor anomalies in the running-titles, in the pagination, and in the sigla, which Johnson accurately noted. 12 12. See F. R. Johnson, A Critical Bibliography of the Works of Edmund Spenser Printed Before 1700, pp. 11–13. The stanzaic distribution across pages is uniform throughout the entire volume: each opening contains exactly seven stanzas of text (where the text is continuous). Ornamental boxes contain- ing the inset arguments at the heads of cantos were designed to take up exactly the same space as a stanza, no doubt in order to regularize layout and simplify casting-off, and were never printed in the bottom position on a page; proems to each of the three books were set on the recto and verso of a leaf; and a single (verso) page was left between Books 1 and 2 (accommodating the woodcut of St George and the dragon) and 2 and 3; otherwise, with a few important excep- tions, the text runs continuously in each book. Johnson supposed that the poem was printed continuously from start to fin- ish, beginning with gathering A and running straight through to gathering Pp; this assumption is retained by Yamashita et al. Noticing that, in gathering F, the pagination is off by two in the outer formes of both sheets (affecting 8 pages in total), Johnson argued that the inner formes were prepared by one compositor or pair of compositors, and the outer formes by another compositor or pair of compositors; the compositor setting the outer formes of F, Johnson reasoned, had temporarily forgotten that the text of the poem began on A2 r and not A1 r . Johnson imagined that one press was therefore used to print the inner formes of both sheets, and the other the outer formes. 13 13. This view has been substantially revised by Yamashita et al., who have determined, through an analysis of word-spacing and spelling preferences, a consistent pattern of division, within each regularly-printed gathering, of work between three distinguishable compositors (X, Y, and Z). See A Textual Companion to The Faerie Queene 1590, pp. 406–408. In any case, the pagination was probably added to the formes of both sheets when—that is to say, just before—the chases were locked on the imposing stone, and the fact that the outer formes of both sheets are off by the same amount supports (though it does not confirm, and certainly does not confirm for the duration of the entire job) the idea that the inner and outer sheets were machined concurrently on two presses. For pagination on the stone, see Fredson Bowers, 'Notes on Running-Titles as Bibliographical Evidence', The Library, 4th ser., 19 (1938), 313–338 (p. 317). Johnson assigned the four skeleton- formes used in the printing the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, and adopted a convenient notation for inner and outer sheets, inner and outer forms: α i (outer sheet, inner forme), α o (outer sheet, outer forme), β o (inner sheet, inner forme), and β o (inner sheet, outer forme), which for conformity with his analysis I have retained. The distribution of running-titles throughout the entire volume is remarkably consis- tent, save for six anomalies. 14 14. For a full description of the idiosyncrasies in the running-titles used to identify the skeleton-formes, see F. R. Johnson, A Critical Bibliography of the Works of Edmund Spenser Printed Before 1700, pp. 16–17. Facsimiles of the running-titles are reproduced by Yamashita et al. as part of a useful summary of the pattern of skeleton-formes used in the printing of the entire volume (see A Textual Companion to The Faerie Queene 1590, pp. 423–425), an exercise in reproduction that I have in part reproduced below (see figure 1). The pattern adopted in gatherings C–S should be considered standard for the print run, and runs (using the notation of Johnson and, in parentheses, of Yamashita et al.): skeleton-forme forme 1 (I) β o 2 (II) α o 3 (III) α i 4 (IV) β i The six exceptions are as follows: 1. Gatherings A and B are anomalous. Skeleton-forme I was used for both sides of the inner sheet ( β o and β i ) of A, and skeleton-forme II for both sides of the outer sheet ( α o and α i ) of A. Skeleton-forme III was used for both sides of the inner sheet ( β o and β i ) of B, and skeleton-forme IV for both sides of the outer sheet ( α o and α i ) of B. 2. Skeleton-forme HI was used to set both sides of the outer sheet ( α o and α i ) of gathering T. Skeleton-forme II was not used. 3. Skeleton-forme I was used to set both sides of the inner sheet ( β o and β i ) of gathering Cc. Skeleton-forme IV was not used. 4. The running-title on position 5 r of skeleton-forme I was changed before print- ing gathering V: a period was added after 'The Faerie Queene'. 5. Some of the running-titles in skeleton-forme IV were altered after the print- ing of gathering Bb (they had been removed during the printing of Bb because Bb3 v and Bb4 r —the end of Book 2 and the beginning of Book 3—have no headlines). 6. Beginning with gathering Dd, skeleton-formes I and IV were switched, I there- after being used for β i , and β o . Johnson offered no explanation for exceptions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6; his explanation for exception 5 is given above, though it should be noted that this explanation is perhaps not as satisfactory as he suggested, given (as we shall see) that running- titles were at other points removed from other skeleton-formes throughout the printing process, and always afterwards carefully replaced. 15 15. As Bowers has argued, relying on evidence from Moxon, the skeleton-forme was prob- ably dismantled after running off a given sheet, and re-assembled piece by piece around the pages currently being imposed: 'in a sense, therefore, the same skeleton has been transferred to the fresh letterpress, instead of the letterpress being added to the undisturbed skeleton.' See Fredson Bowers, 'Notes on Running-Titles as Bibliographical Evidence', p. 319. The running- titles, effectively part of the furniture, were thus transferred from one forme (Bowers' 'fresh let- terpress') to another. In occasional instances where a running-title was not required in its usual position in the forme, then, it must have been simply, but carefully, left aside during printing, and then recovered for the imposition of the following sheet. That some running-titles, left aside in this way at one point during the printing of gathering Bb of The Faerie Queene in 1590, were altered suggests that these titles were not as carefully handled as other running-titles, similarly suspended, at other points in the printing. Given the overall precision of the process, this de- parture from usual practice invites investigation. In their Textual Companion to The Faerie Queene 1590, Yamashita et al. have documented and illustrated in detail the account of pagination, running-titles, skeleton-formes, and other bibliographical data supplied by Johnson, adding to this work their copious and compelling analysis of compositorial stints. 16 16. See Yamashita et al., A Textual Companion to The Faerie Queene 1590, pp. 405–411. By dis- criminating systematically between word- and punctuation-spacing, and between regular orthographical patterns resulting from underlying spelling preferences, Yamashita et al. distinguished three different compositors, who divided with near-mechanical regularity the sixteen pages of each gathering into consistent and equal shares. 17 17. The following account summarizes the results of Yamashita et al. in their Textual Companion to The Faerie Queene 1590, pp. 407–408. D. F. McKenzie has rightly questioned the reliability of evidence from punctuation- and word-spacing as a basis for identifying com- positors and demarcating their stints, in 'Stretching a Point: Or, the Case of the Spaced-Out Comps', Studies in Bibliography, 37 (1984), 106–121 (repr. in Making Meaning, pp. 91–106). It should be noted that Yamashita et al. have used evidence of spacing in conjunction with other types of evidence, such as spelling preferences, and have interpreted and tested their findings for compositorial stints by the broader, and regular, patterns of press-work apparent throughout the production of the volume. Their hypotheses on compositorial stints thus appear credible, while always constrained by the usual limitations on inductive inference. Compositor X is thought to have set pages 1 r —3 r in gather- ings C to Oo, with very few exceptions (H1 r , H2 v , N1 r , Z1 r , Bb1 v , Ii1 r , Kk1 r , and Kk1 v ); Compositor Y pages 3 v —5 v in gatherings C to Oo (though he was helped, probably by X, in gatherings Hh and Ii, and on pages Ff4 v , Ll5 r , Nn4 v , and Oo5 r ); and Compositor Z pages 6 v —8 v in gatherings C to Oo, except for Y6 v , which may have been set by Compositor X. Page 6 r (i.e. the eleventh page) in each gathering appears to have been a 'swing' page, on which all three compositors may have collaborated, variously in different gatherings. As for the (anomalous) first two gatherings, Compositors X and Z seem to have divided A roughly evenly, while all three compositors seem to have worked on B, largely according to the divisions observed in the rest of the run. The compositorial analysis of Yamashita et al. supports Johnson's picture of the extraordinary regularity of the printing of The Faerie Queene in 1590: with only a few (and as we will see, explicable) exceptions, the compositors setting the manuscript worked to a rigorously methodical divi- sion of labor, very rarely varying their individual responsibilities. Dedication, Vision, and Revision: The Poet in the Printing House While the computer-aided statistical work upon which the analysis of com- position in A Textual Companion is based has undoubtedly added significantly to our understanding of the printing of The Faerie Queene in 1590, the rest of the analysis of Yamashita et al. perpetuates some of Johnson's unfortunate errors, and adds new mistakes both of omission and commission, to our picture of the use of the four skeleton-formes. These mistakes substantially cloud the evidence of the order of imposition of the gatherings, which, it turns out, were not printed sequentially. Yamashita et al. similarly stepped back from offering an interpreta- tion synthesizing the various types of bibliographical evidence they had assimi- lated from Johnson, and newly supplied themselves. As the following discussion will make clear, there is a great deal of significant bibliographical evidence to suggest that Spenser was intimately and presently engaged in the printing of the text; that he substantially interfered with and delayed Wolfe's press run; that on many substantial points of layout and composition, including the position of the 'prefatory' material and the dedication to the Queen, Spenser and the printer remained unresolved until the last moment; and that many of the latest altera- tions to the 1590 text (as would again be true in 1596) concerned contemporary political allusions, and particularly the allegorical representations of Elizabeth. One of the most ambitious and useful expansions of Johnson's work provided in A Textual Companion to The Faerie Queene 1590 is in the form of a large table that records in meticulous detail the disposal of the various running-titles, regu- larly associated with one of the four skeleton-formes, throughout the volume. On the basis of this table (a similar version of which Johnson must have generated in his own research, though he did not publish it), the pattern of skeleton-forme use can be reconstructed; correctly documenting the deployment of running-titles is thus crucial to understanding the precise use of the skeleton-formes, and basic to any interpretation of the order of imposition. 18 18. The use of skeleton-forme evidence in determining the order of imposition was estab- lished by Fredson Bowers in his canonical article, 'Notes on Running-Titles as Bibliographical Evidence'; see also 'The Headline in Early Books', English Institute Annual 1941 (1942), p. 186. Along with his skeptical reappraisal of many types of bibliographical evidence, McKenzie questioned arguments built on skeleton-formes in 'Printers of the Mind' (pp. 23–31; repr. in Making Meaning, pp. 32–38), particularly when related to observations on timing, compositorial practice, and edition sizes. The present study does not attempt complex abstractions based on the combination of such kinds of evidence, though I occasionally offer hypotheses on the pos- sible or, in some cases likely, causes of discontinuities in the printing process. In all, Yamashita et al. identify nineteen distinct running-titles, each of which is reproduced in facsimile in their study. Distinguished by their typographical features, sixteen basic variants exist, four to each skeleton-forme; for various reasons during the printing of the text, according to these scholars, three new running-titles were composed and used in the place of three originals. The two skeleton-formes regularly used from gather- ing C to print the outer sheet of each gathering (II and III) remained remarkably consistent throughout the press run. All of the changes to running-titles took place in skeleton-formes I and IV, used to print the inner sheet of each gather- ing, and were made in gathering V and after; the imposition of the inner sheet became increasingly troubled after gathering Bb, and most of the changes to running-titles took place between this point and the end of the job (Pp). These, and further observations on the pattern of use of the running-titles, can be fol- lowed in table 1, a corrected version of that compiled by Yamashita et al., which also (for reasons that will become clear later) includes their findings on com- positors' stints; for ease of reading the table, I have also reproduced analyses of skeleton-forme construction (figure 1). The first serious mistake, though it seems minor, in this presentation is that these scholars have distinguished two running-titles—16 and 17—that are in fact the same setting of type, and thus the same title; the printing of this title, used regularly in gatherings C to Bb to print the recto of the sixth leaf (i.e. position 6 r ), became intermittently corrupt during the course of the print run, such that by the time of the later gatherings the terminal 'ne' of 'Queene' in 'The Faerie Queene' seems regularly to have split and recombined, and appears deformed. Yamashita et al. distinguish the damaged presentation of this title from the sound FIGURE 1. The initial disposition of running-titles in the four skeleton-formes. The introduc- tion of running-titles 11 (a modification of 10) and 19, along with the exchange of skeleton- forme I for IV and the reversal of orientation of skeleton-forme IV, can be traced in table 1. A similar figure appears in Yamashita et al. (1990). FIGURE 2. Damage to running-title 16 in position 6 r of gathering P (a) is similar to that apparent in the same running-title in position 3 r of gathering Ll (b). While the running-title occasionally appears sound, as in position 6 r of gathering K (c), or indeed in position 6 r of gathering T (not shown), it is clear from the regular fluctuations throughout die printing pro- cess that a clean-state 16 is not to be distinguished from a foul-state 17.

While it is true that the type in running-title 16 shows various and shifting states in this part of the text, the range of distinction between its cleanest and its foulest presentations here is no larger than, for example, its appearances in the inner forme of the inner sheet in gatherings K to M. As is obvious from the illustrations presented in figure 2, 19 19. The evidence upon which I have based my research, and from which I draw the illustrations presented here, comes from two copies of the 1590 edition of The Faerie Qyeene held in the University Library, Cambridge: CUL SSS. 22. 27 and Sel. 5. 101. These are both comparatively 'typical' representatives of the edition, including the wide-state setting of the title-page date, the royal dedication, and the cancellans in gathering Pp. the occasional deterioration and subsequent improvement in this Table 1.

FIGURE 3. The substitution of a swash 'C' in 'Canto' in running-title 13 between position 5 r of gathering Ll ((a), above) and 5 r of gathering Mm (b) leaves a telltale marker providing evidence of the sequence of imposition of gatherings. Because the swash majuscule appears in position 5 r of gatherings Dd (c), Ee, Mm, Nn, and Oo (not shown), but not in gatherings Ff to Ll, it is obvious that Dd and Ee were printed out of sequence; the coincidence of the introduction of running-title 19 (for 16) in gathering Ee, combined with its (only) reappear- ance in gathering Oo, suggests that gatherings Dd and Ee were printed between Nn and Oo. This pattern is confirmed by the substitution of a colon (for a full stop) at the end of running- title 13 in position 5 r of gathering Nn; this colon also appears in the same running-title in gatherings Dd ((c), above), Ee, and Oo. The copy illustrated here is Cambridge University Library, Sel. 5. 101. Reproduced by permission of the Syndics of Cambridge University Library. particular running-title, both between extant copies of the same gathering, and between gatherings, is a usual feature of the work well before the period after Dd, and we should therefore not distinguish between running-titles 16 and 17; in short, 17 does not exist. 20 20. While it is comparatively straightforward to observe that the 'damage' to the terminal 'ne' of 'Queene' in this title recurs and disappears intermittently throughout the press run, it is less obvious—to me, at least—what originally caused this blot in the printing. Strange as it may sound, the evidence seems to indicate the repeated superposition of something like a thread over these particular letters, as the effect created seems to be of a missing line running at an incline from the middle of the body of the 'n' to the upper right of the counter of the subsequent 'e'. Yamashita et al. make a related mistake in the same sequence of gatherings, with respect to their documentation of running-title 13; this time it is an error of omission repeated from Johnson's analysis. In gatherings Dd, Ee, Mm, Nn, and Oo, running-title 13 appears in a slightly modified state on the recto of the fifth leaf (position 5 r ) of each gathering; as will be immediately obvious from figure 3, the italic majuscule 'C' of 'Canto' has been exchanged, in these gatherings, for a swash majuscule. Given the near-absolute regularity with which running-titles are generally retained throughout the printing of the text, the way this swash 'C' seems to appear, disappear, and then reappear, should be treated with extreme suspicion: there is no other place in the sequence where a change to a running- title is subsequently changed again, and certainly no place where this correction is then changed anew, in the same way. The fact that the introduction of this swash 'C' to running-title 13 is coincident with another change to skeleton-forme IV—the substitution of running-title 19 for 16 in gathering Ee—makes it all too obvious what took place. This part of the text was not printed sequentially. Fol- lowing the printing of gathering Cc, the compositors moved on to gathering Ff, then proceeded through to Nn before returning to Dd and Ee; after completing Ee, they finished the printing of the main part of the text of the poem with gather- ing Oo. This sequence is confirmed by another minor change made to running- title 13 in the printing of gathering Nn, where a colon was substituted for the full stop after 'Queene'; this colon also, and only, appears in the same running-title in gatherings Dd, Ee, and Oo. It is crucial to note that this pattern of imposition was not immediately apparent in the analysis of Yamashita et al. because of the confusion created by the false distinction of a supposed running-title 17. There are three further pieces of evidence that confirm this non-sequential pattern of imposition in the final gatherings of the volume, again information overlooked or not collected by Johnson or Yamashita et al. The compositors obviously had to adjust the running-titles every time they were used, updating pagination and, less frequently, canto headings for all running-titles, and, on two occasions, altering the book headings. Generally speaking the compositors were conservative about changing the running-titles between formes, making as few substitutions as possible. Thus, in an instance where 'Cant. II.' was to be changed to 'Cant. III', the compositor might simply replace the full stop with an 'I', to avoid unnecessary adjustment of the type spaces between the central and peripheral elements of the headline. A result of this conservatism is that the spaces between the pagination and the central element of the running-title, and between the central element and the canto heading, tend to remain fairly con- stant, but not perfectly constant, in width, from gathering to gathering. Measur- ing these distances in each headline, from gathering to gathering, thus produces a suggestive indication of the order of imposition of gatherings. Table 2 reports the distances between the pagination (i.e. the outer element) and the central ele- ment in the headline for running-titles 2, 3, 5, and 8 in gatherings Aa to Oo in the Cambridge University Library copy (Sel. 5. 101). The evidence of running- title 3 is probably too erratic to construe, and that from running-title 5 too regular; but the patterns in the spacing of running-titles 2 and 8 are suggestive. Running-title 2, in particular, is extremely conservative in the spacing of this part of the headline, changing by only a single space between the printing of gather- ings Ff and Oo. That this space was added when the running-title was used to print gathering Ee, and retained for gathering Oo (following immediately after- wards) seems the likeliest explanation for this pattern. In running-title 8, too, the spacing in this part of the headline shows a clear pattern of consistency between gatherings Aa/Bb and Ff/Gg, on the one hand, and Dd/Ee and Ll/Mm/Nn, on the other. The pattern of spacing in these running-titles across gatherings, then, tends to support the idea that gatherings Dd and Ee were printed between Table 2. Distance between pagination and central element of running-title Running-Title 2 Running-Title 3 Running-Title 5 Running-Title 8 Cc3 v 2.0 cm Cc5 v 1.90 cm Aa3 v 1.05 cm Aa5 v 1.60 cm Cc4 v 2.0 cm Cc6 v 1.80 cm Dd4 v 0.85 cm Bb5 v 1.90 cm Dd3 v 1.3 cm Dd5 v 2.0 cm Ee4 v 0.85 cm Dd6 v 1.75 cm Ee3 v 1.4 cm Ee5 v 1.65 cm Ff4 v 0.85 cm Ee6 v 1.75 cm Ff3 v 1.3 cm Ff5 v 1.55 cm Gg4 v 0.85 cm Ff6 v 1.90 cm Gg3 v 1.3 cm Gg5 v 1.60 cm Hh4 v 0.85 cm Gg6 v 1.90 cm Hh3 v 1.3 cm Hh5 v 1.65 cm Ii4 v 0.85 cm Hh6 v 1.55 cm Ii3 v 1.3 cm Ii5 v 1.55 cm Kk4 v 0.85 cm Ii6 v 1.55 cm Kk3 v 1.3 cm Kk5 v 1.65 cm Ll4 v 0.85 cm Kk6 v 1.55 cm Ll3 v 1.3 cm Ll5 v 1.60 cm Mm4 v 0.85 cm Ll6 v 1.75 cm Mm3 v 1.3 cm Mm5 v 1.60 cm Nn4 v 0.85 cm Mm6 v 1.75 cm Nn3 v 1.3 cm Nn5 v 1.60 cm Oo4 v 0.85 cm Nn6 v 1.75 cm Oo3 v 1.4 cm Oo5 v 1.60 cm Oo6 v 1.60 cm Nn and Oo, a pattern consistent with, if not supported by, the patterns of spacing in running-titles 3 and 5 across the same gatherings. Two other pieces of evidence are more conclusive. Both relate to mistakes in the running-titles not collated by Johnson or Yamashita et al. Running-title 8, used in position 6 v as part of skeleton-forme IV in gatherings Dd to Oo, includes (like running-title 5) as its central element the phrase 'The third Booke of'. In gathering Aa, which includes the latter part of canto xii of Book II of the poem, this running-title naturally reads 'The second Booke of'. The compositor respon- sible for updating this running-title for its first use in printing Book III of the poem—in position 5 v in gathering Bb—accidentally removed the space between 'The' and 'third', such that the running-title presents a central element reading 'Thethird Booke of'. By the time this running-title appears in gatherings Dd and Ee, it has been corrected; but, crucially, it appears in its uncorrected state in gatherings Ff and Gg (see figure 4). Given the patterns already noted in the use of running-titles 3, 5, 13, 16, and 19, it is obvious that the correction to run- ning-title 8 was made between the imposition of gatherings Gg and Hh, and that it appears corrected in Dd and Ee because these gatherings were printed there- after. Similarly, Johnson and Yamashita et al. failed to notice a substantial and coincident error in running-title 6, used in position 1 v between gatherings C and Oo. The compositor charged with updating this running-title between Books II and III neglected to change 'second' to 'third' in the transition between books; the central element in running-title 6 thus appears incorrectly in gatherings Cc, Ff, and Gg as 'The second Booke of', but appears correctly in gatherings Dd and Ee (as in Hh through to Oo) as 'The third Booke of'. Again, given what we know about errors in and changes to the other running-titles in this part of the printing, it is obvious that this mistake was noticed and corrected between the imposition of gatherings Gg and Hh, appearing in its corrected state in Dd and Ee because these gatherings were not printed until after Nn. The coincidence of so many mistakes and irregularities in this part of the print job may have been due to fatigue, but it certainly had something to do with the need to skip gatherings Dd and Ee, an obstruction to the regular printing that FIGURE 4. The central element of running-title 8 in position 5 v of gathering Bb reads 'Thethird Booke of' (a); this mistake in spacing also appears in running-title 8 in position 6v of gatherings Ff (not shown) and Gg (b), but appears corrected in all other gatherings, including Dd (not shown) and Ee (c). This evidence suggests that the spacing in running- title 8 was corrected between the imposition of gatherings Gg and Hh, and corroborates the hypothesis that Dd and Ee were printed at some point after Ff and Gg.

It would not be particularly safe, at least at this point, to speculate too nicely on the reasons why the press-men went directly from gathering Cc to Ff, but a number of elements attending this decision should be noted. First, the most likely reason for skipping the material contained in these gatherings was that the manuscript— or an authorized manuscript—was not available at the time that the printer needed it. Regardless of the speed or expedition with which we suppose the job to have advanced, the only likely explanation for this, if we assume that Wolfe had not mislaid some of his sheets (and we will have cause, shortiy, for believing that he did not), is that Spenser had taken the relevant parts of the text away. It is further obvious that Wolfe's press- men would not have skipped two gatherings, or those exact gatherings, unless the material withheld or unavailable spanned them both; if the missing material had been in Ee, Wolfe might have printed Dd as normal, and then gone to Ff or, if it had been in Dd only, he might have skipped Dd and begun again with Ee. Given that canto iii of Book III is the only canto entirely contained within these two gatherings, it seems likely that it was this canto to which Wolfe's men did not, mid-run, have access. Much more importandy, from a bibliographical perspective, it should be im- mediately obvious that this sequence of events following on from gathering Cc al- most certainly has something to do with the considerable anomaly of the printing of that gathering. As noted by Johnson, and remembered above, skeleton-forme I was used to print both the outer and the inner formes of the inner sheet of gather- ing Cc. In the context of the regular and efficient four-skeleton-forme/two-press system used to print The Faerie Queene in 1590, this doubling of a single skeleton- forme to print both formes of the same sheet strongly suggests that printing in this gathering slowed, and proceeded with only one press. After the printing of Cc, as Johnson also noted, the pattern of skeleton-formes used for the inner sheet was reversed, with skeleton-forme IV used to print the outer forme, and skeleton- forme I the inner forme. The compositors working on The Faerie Queene would as a matter of course have been imposing at least one forme while another was in press, and would have taken up whichever skeleton-forme was to hand, as soon as another had been laid on the press. Given that skeleton-forme I was used twice in this gathering, it must therefore have been alternated, on a single press (i.e. not necessarily on one actual press, but at single press power), with skeleton-formes II and III. Because the type from this skeleton-forme—regularly used at this point to print the outer forme of the inner sheet—had been distributed while the inner formes of Bb were still being printed on two presses (outer formes, as Yamashita et al. determined, were regularly printed before inner formes throughout the volume 21 21. See Yamashita et al., A Textual Companion to The Faerie Queene 1590, p. 429. ), it was available, as usual, for the outer forme of the inner sheet of Cc. At this point, too, skeleton-forme II, as usual, was available to set the type for the outer forme of the outer sheet. When it became obvious that printing would have to slow, the press-men moved to a one-press system, and skeleton-forme II was printed first, followed by skeleton-forme I, now in sequence rather than, as was usual, in tandem; when I was laid on the press, the type from II was redis- tributed, but there had been plenty of time, already, to get on with setting the inner forme of the outer sheet, using skeleton-forme III. After that had gone to the press, the type from skeleton-forme I was redistributed. At this point, because the compositors were working with a one-press system, there had been no need to rush the setting of the inner forme of the inner sheet, and so skeleton-forme IV had not, as was usual, yet been set out; because skeleton-forme I was now avail- able, and contained the correct canto markings in its running-titles, it was re- used. This process of imposing gathering Cc and the adjacent gatherings can be summarized as follows: Press 1 Press 2 C–Bb II→III I→IV Cc II→I III→I Ff–Nn II→III IV→I The lack of urgency apparent in this slow process—the compositors would have been comparatively idle, with respect to the Spenser job at least, during the printing of the outer forme of the inner sheet—suggests that the decision had not yet been taken to skip gatherings Dd and Ee, and return to a two-press system with gathering Ff. The psychology of the slow-down in the printing of Cc, when coupled to the subsequent events in Dd-Ee and Ff-Nn, seems difficult to ignore: Wolfe and his press-men probably slowed down in Cc because they knew, at the end of the gathering, they were going to hit a problem. That problem was a lack of text. While it is of course possible that the reduction in power in gathering Cc was unrelated to the decision to skip gatherings Dd and Ee—the demands of some concurrent project may have required an extra press at the same time that Wolfe's compositors hit a snag with copy in the following gatherings—on balance, the coincidence of these unusual events suggests that they were related. In the light of these telltale marks of non-sequential printing, it does not seem surprising that the only reversal in the orientation of a skeleton-forme during the whole press run—the reversal of IV between its use for the inner forme of the inner sheet of Bb and its use for the outer forme of the inner sheet of Ff (see table 1)—coincided with the slowing of the printing in Cc and the decision to skip Dd and Ee. Of course, no signature appeared in the usual place (position 4 r ) in skeleton-forme IV in gathering Bb, as this page between Books II and III of the poem was left blank; but where a compositor might normally have judged the orientation by eye without the signature, the gap occasioned by the double use of I in Cc meant that the type from IV was probably distributed some time before, rather than when, it was reimposed with new pages. Oddly enough, this was not the first time in the course of printing The Faerie Queene in 1590 that these beleaguered press-men had had to slow down, and per- haps even come to a stop, nor would it be the last. As noted above, the dedication to Elizabeth appearing on the verso of the title page in gathering A was almost certainly added as a stop-press correction, as several copies survived without the dedication. The evidence on compositorial stints gathered by Yamashita et al. supports this hypothesis. As can be verified by comparing the data for gather- ings A and B in table 1, Compositor X, who would have been expected to set at least 1 r –3 r for gatherings A and B, did not have a clear hand in either 1 r or 1 v of gathering B, but was helped in both cases. In every other gathering in the volume (36 in all), Compositor X was solely responsible for setting these first pages. To understand why X did not set these pages, and to appreciate its relevance to the stop-press correction of the royal dedication, we must return briefly to another of the anomalies in the printing of the volume that Johnson did not explain: unlike the main sequence of regular imposition using the four-chase/two-press system, gatherings A and B were printed with one skeleton-forme per sheet—i.e. using the same skeleton-forme for both formes of the inner and outer sheets, for each of the two sheets in each gathering: II for the outer sheet of A, I for the inner sheet of A, IV for the outer sheet of B, and III for the inner sheet of B. As noted above, in relation to the similar problem in Cc, the process of setting the type, printing off the formes, and distributing the type made it convenient to alternate skeleton-formes: the same skeleton-forme could not be used efficiently in back to back press-stints. It is thus very likely that the first two gatherings were printed in tandem: Press 1 Press 2 II ( ± o A) I ( β o A) IV ( α o B) III ( β o B) II ( α i A) I ( β i A) IV ( α i B) III ( β i B) This pattern would have left skeleton formes II and I available, during the impo- sition of the inner formes of both sheets of B, to be re-set for gathering C, thereby setting in motion the regular pattern of one-skeleton-per-forme imposition used thereafter until gathering T. The absence of Compositor X from the early stages of setting the type for both of his usual stints in gathering B, then, coincides with the printing of the inner, and later the outer, formes of gathering A. In both of these gatherings, substantial stop-press corrections had to be inserted: in the outer forme, the narrow-spaced date of the title-page on 1 r had to be re-spaced to a centered, wide-state layout; 22 22. Emma Unger argued in the third volume of The Carl H. Pforzheimer Library: English Literature 1475–1700 (New York: Carl H. Pforzheimer Library, 1940), p. 1002, that the wide- state setting of the date represents the earlier, rather than the later, state of the title page. I have dispatched Unger's supposals; see Zurcher, 'Getting It Back to Front in 1590'. and in the inner forme, the royal dedication had to be added on 1 v . The second correction, in particular, would have taken a reasonable amount of time; the fact that Compositor X was back on hand to set the type for 2 r of B suggests that (as the low incidence of the blank-state vari- ant in extant copies suggests) this correction was made relatively soon into the perfection of A. The more obvious question to be asked about this scheme for printing the first two gatherings in tandem is, of course, why it was followed at all. The sensible pattern for using four skeleton-formes on two presses to set a quarto in 8s is, as we have seen, the one followed for the majority of the press run—the advantage of using each skeleton-forme once in each gathering is that it allows the compositors to work on contiguous pages, rather than skipping from gathering to gathering, and thus reduces the likelihood of formatting errors (as we have seen, the she- nanigans of Dd and Ee would later coincide with many such errors). Thinking narratively about the decisions taken at this stage of the printing, it seems likely that, to begin with, the compositors intended to follow the same system for the first two gatherings that they would take up, as soon as possible, in gathering C; but that some obstacle prevented them from doing so when, having laid skeleton- formes II and I on their respective presses, they turned to skeleton-formes IV and III. The likely reason the compositors might have elected not to set the type for the inner formes of both sheets of gathering A was, of course, the now-familiar one: a final decision on the text for these formes had not yet been taken. Given that the royal dedication was later inserted as a stop-press correction to 1 v in gathering A, it seems likely that the obstacle holding up the perfection of gather- ing A a day or two earlier was this same problem. The dedication to the Queen, completely in majuscules, would surely have been an element too conspicuous for Wolfe merely to have overlooked, and subsequently corrected, especially when he had not, yet, printed any other dedicatory or prefatory material for the vol- ume; rather, the coincidence of an anomalous use of skeleton-formes, on the one hand, and on the other a stop-press correction, suggests that Spenser, or perhaps Wolfe, had not yet decided how, or whether, to incorporate the royal dedication. Furthermore, the fact that the printing commenced at all, and commenced with A, suggests that Wolfe was confident of the layout, or had no reason to be uncon- fident, when the printing began; the indecision seems to have arisen during the imposition of the outer formes of the outer and inner sheets of A, when skeleton- formes IV and III were deployed to set gathering B rather than the inner formes of both sheets of A. The psychology implicit in this pattern of imposition, again, suggests not only that manuscript materials, or authorized manuscript materials, were not available, but that the status of these materials changed suddenly at a particular, and definable, point of the printing. We are now in a position to make some limited inferences about the two interruptions to the sequence of printing so far discussed. In both cases, the compositors seem to have slowed down—in the case of the first two gatherings, Compositors X and Z worked without Y on the text of A, while in Cc the printing seems to have temporarily stalled and to have proceeded at single press. In the first case, the compositors seem to have encountered an unexpected snag after they had committed themselves to printing the gathering (beginning with the outer formes of A), while in the second case, they seem to have slowed produc- tion of Cc in anticipation of an upcoming difficulty in the following gathering. With this in mind, it is almost certainly significant that both of these instances of interruption in the printing correspond to elements in the text particularly closely associated with Elizabeth herself: the obstacle in gathering A seems certainly to have been the royal dedication, while the cantos at the center of the ultimately deferred gatherings, Dd and Ee—Book III, cantos ii and iii—deal with Brit- omart's vision of Artegall in the magic mirror, and her subsequent visit to Merlin who, forecasting Britomart's famous progeny, concludes his prophecy with the 'royall virgin', Elizabeth. The pattern and implicit psychology of the slowing, the ultimate ordering, and the selective skipping of the printing in both of these cases suggest that Spenser was intimately involved in at least this part of the produc- tion process (that is to say, intimately involved insofar as he was meddling, and holding the whole process up!), and that he was particularly anxious about parts of his text that spoke directly to, or explicitly represented, Elizabeth herself. If the reason for skipping gatherings Dd and Ee was that Spenser had withheld canto iii of Book III—and what else could have caused Wolfe to complicate his sequence in such a way, a way that would lead to the introduction of several errors?—then it seems likely that Spenser modified the text of this particular canto during the press run itself. He could not have meddled much, as the canto still needed to fit precisely into the available 10 leaves—though it is worth noting that, where the canto ends on Ee8 r , the compositors left an unusually large gap at the end of the page, which they filled with a type ornament rather than commencing (as they had done for Book III, canto iii itself) with an ornamental box and the first four lines of the opening stanza of canto iv. Wolfe's hands were already tied at this point by the extant, fixed state of Ff1 r —canto iv had to begin on Ee8 v —but the unusually generous layout of Ee8 r suggests that the original casting-off may have provided for one more stanza in canto iii than Spenser ultimately supplied. Spurning at a Dead Dog: Patronage, Politics, and Allegory Of Johnson's original six anomalies in the otherwise consistent layout of the skeleton-formes and running-titles in the printing of The Faerie Queene in 1590, then, several have already begun to disclose information about the sequence of printing the gatherings of the poem. The doubled pattern in the deployment of skeleton-formes in gathering Cc, interpreted alongside fresh evidence of related inconsistencies in the appearance of running-titles in contiguous gatherings, sug- gests that this kind of anomaly provides evidence of a slowing, or perhaps even a halt, to the printing at such points in the text. A similar pattern of doubling in the skeleton-formes in gatherings A and B seems likely to be associated with the stop-press corrections made to the recto and verso of A1, witness to another point in the printing where the compositors were probably suddenly faced with a problem in their immediate copy. But there is one further point in the sequence of gatherings, in gathering T, where the pattern of usage of the skeleton-formes shows exactly the same kind of doubling, a pattern that could only have occurred if the compositors were working very slowly, and at single press. The evidence of interruption in the printing of gathering T takes us back, again, to Nashe's satirical comments on the printing of The Faerie Queene in 1590, and once again implicate the tangled threads of Spenser's allegory, his dedications, and the pa- tronage politics of his carefully-tendered epic. Toward the close of the 'priuate Epistle of the Author to the Printer' that Nashe added to the second edition of Pierce Penilesse, he vomits up a few characteristically dark sayings about his satirical intent in the ensuing work, com- ments that serve above all to link Pierce Penilesse to The Faerie Queene, and both texts to the recent Martinist controversy, to the legacy of the Earl of Leicester, and to the now-fallen Ralegh: Beggerly lyes no beggerly wit but can inuent: who spurneth not at a dead dogge? but I am of another mettal, they shall know that I liue as their euil Angel, to haunt them world without end, if they disquiet me without cause. 23 23.

As Charles Nicholl has demonstrated in his careful reading of the 'Tale of a Battle-Dore' in Pierce Penilesse, much of Nashe's satire is directed, in an ad hominem attack, at the memory of the Earl of Leicester (d. 1588). 24 24. See Charles Nicholl, A Cup of News: The Life of Thomas Nashe (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 112–115. Leicester's legacy as a patron of 'Swiss' bishops and precisian preachers was politically charged in 1592 for the same reasons that it had been charged in 1591, when Spenser published Complaints, including Virgil's Gnat, 'long since dedicated to the most noble and ex- cellent Lord, the Earle of Leicester, late deceased'. Leicester's public support for precisian causes, such as his patronage of the radical 'puritan' preacher Thomas Cartwright, or his support for bishops and archbishops like Edmund Grindal, was compromised by the salacious, and likely true, stories of his rapacious sexual appetite and the occasionally murderous means he compassed to satisfy it. The cupiditas that supposedly characterized his sexual and 'personal' life was taken by his detractors as evidence of the self-interested ambitions and designs that Leices- ter had for Elizabeth herself, for the crown, and for the realm; Leicester's sexual licentiousness was read by his contemporaries as a sign for his own ambitions for power, and for his final disregard for common weal in the face of his own self- satisfaction. 25 25. The construal of sexual appetite as a sign for political ambition is of course an explicit polemical strategy in anti-Leicestrian tracts like Leicester's Commonwealth ; but it also figures as a—and perhaps the —central node of allegorical transmission in Philip Sidney's sonnet se- quence of the early 1580s, Astrophel and Stella. In this 'tragicomedy of love', as Nashe called it when he introduced the sonnets to a hungry readership in 1591, Sidney's protagonist Astrophel wresdes with his concupiscent desire for the virtuous Stella; but the flickering intrusions of an extra-fabular political context to this erotic plot (styled as 'ambition' throughout) acceler- ate during the sequence until, in the penultimate sonnet, Sidney's creature Astrophel frankly desires of Elizabeth's creature Stella (in this sonnet, 'Princesse', 'soueraigne', and 'Queene') the office of her 'Lieftenancy'. While there is neither space nor need here to address Sidney's sequence in detail, the conflation of cupiditas with 'ambition' throughout the work provides another important literary context—in personal and political terms situated neatiy between Spenser and Leicester, and well known to Nashe in the early 1590s—for the political problem that Leicester continued to present to precisian interests in 1592. It was thus essential for allies and survivors of Leicester's factional support of precisian causes—Walsingham, the Sidney family, Ralegh, Robert Beale, Sir Francis Knollys, and others, probably including Spenser himselfS—to defend Leicester's reputation, and to vitiate the supposedly automatic link be- tween cupidity and self-interested political ambition. This project became the more urgent for the Sidney faction in the early 1590s as a result of the death of Sir Francis Walsingham (d. 1590), and the rise of Sir Walter Ralegh. Ralegh's character was open to the same ad hominem attacks as Leicester's had been: the same stories of sexual depravity, of enforced maids, of illegitimate children, and of an almost psycho-sexual enchantment of Elizabeth herself circulated in anti-Protestant and anti-Ralegh circles. Ralegh's association with the Throckmorton family, through his clandestine marriage to Bess Throck- morton, upon its public exposure in the summer of 1592 suddenly realized his threat as a new Leicestrian patron of puritans: Bess's uncle Job Throckmorton was probably the author of most, if not all, of the Martin Marprelate tracts of the late 1580s, and the family had strong ties to the Cartwright-Penry-Udall circle responsible for a dramatic upsurge in precisian preaching and nonconformity in the early 1590s. 26 26. For the extent and significance of Ralegh's connection to the Throckmorton family, see A. L. Rowse, Ralegh and the Throckmortons (London: Macmillan, 1962). For Job Throckmorton's role in the Martin Marprelate conspiracy, see L. H. Carlson, Martin Marprelate, gentleman: Master Job Throkmorton laid open in his colors (San Marino, California: Huntington Library Press, 1981), and Patrick Collinson, 'Throckmorton, Job (1545–1601)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 2004). To attack Leicester publicly between 1590 and 1592 was to attack Ralegh covertly; to defend Leicester publicly, as Spenser did, was in the same period to defend Ralegh. When Nashe promises to be an 'euil Angel' to anyone who disquiets him without cause, in his preface to the second edition of Pierce Penilesse in the au- tumn of 1592, he is responding directly to a very specific and charged bit of the historical allegory of The Faerie Queene, published two years previously—one as- sociated directly with the legacy of the dead Leicester, and the new incarnation (at that time) of his political and religious agenda in Walter Ralegh. The begin- ning of Book II, canto viii of The Faerie Queene finds Guyon, the patron knight of temperance, lying in a swoon outside the delve of Mammon: oppressed with the 'exceeding might' of the temptations offered him 'below the earth', Guyon's 'life did flit away out of her nest', leaving him apparently dead and defenceless to the predations and infamies of his enemies. Pyrochles and Cymochles, the two sons of Acrates whom Guyon had defeated in cantos v and vi, discover his body, and set about despoiling it, determined to take their revenge upon his honor, if not upon his life. Guyon's only protection comes from his guide the Palmer, to whom his body is committed in trust, at the opening of the canto, by the 'faire young man', an angel sent by God to preserve Guyon's life and person. As the angel tells the Palmer: The charge, which God doth vnto me arret, Of his deare safetie, I to thee commend; Yet will I not forgoe, ne yet forget The care thereof my selfe vnto the end, But euermore him succour, and defend Against his foe and mine…. ( FQ II.viii.8) Where Spenser promises Guyon an angel to defend and succour him 'euermore', Nashe promises his own enemies an 'euil Angel, to haunt them world without end'. Guyon's, and the angel's, 'foe' is any man who will dishonor Guyon's dead (in fact merely sleeping) body, an abstract quickly realized, upon the angel's departure, when Archimago, Pyrochles, and Cymochles appear full of 'coles of contention and whot vengeance' ( FQ II.viii.11). It is with the arrival of this trio of despoilers that Nashe's other two references to this passage—to 'mettal' and to the 'dead dogge'—become clear. Pyrochles and Cymochles quickly set about 'disarraying' Guyon's body of his shield and helm, deaf to the pleas of the effectless Palmer, but are immediately interrupted by the arrival of Prince Arthur, whom Archimago recognizes as their natural enemy. Archimago has by this point purloined Arthur's sword, intending (as he indicates in stanza 18 of canto iii) to bestow it on the braggart Braggadocchio; Pyrochles, addressing himself swordlessly to confront Arthur, demands Mord- dure of Archimago, but is refused by the enchanter because the sword's power is 'contrarie to the worke, which ye intend': For that same knights owne sword this is of yore, Which Merlin made by his almightie art For that his noursling, when he knighthood swore, Therewith to doen his foes eternall smart. The metall first he mixt with Medœwart, That no enchauntment from his dint might saue; Then it in flames of Aetna wrought apart, And seuen times dipped in the bitter waue Of hellish Styx, which hidden vertue to it gaue. The vertue is, that neither steele, nor stone The stroke thereof from entrance may defend; Ne euer may be vsed by his fone, Ne forst his rightfull owner to offend, Ne euer will it breake, ne euer bend. Wherefore Morddure it rightfully is hight. In vaine therefore, Pyrochles, should I lend The same to thee, against his lord to fight, For sure it would deceiue thy labour, and thy might. ( FQ II.viii.20–21) Pyrochles, defying Archimago, seizes the sword and tries to fight Arthur with it; sure enough, at the two critical points in the ensuing battle when Pyrochles deliv- ers the death-blow to the Prince, the 'faithfull steele such treason no'uld endure', and Arthur survives to triumph over both brothers. Nashe's joke about being 'of another mettal' locates his comments on satire, alongside the 'euil Angel' allu- sion, as a direct reference to this passage from The Faerie Queene : when his metal bites, Nashe indicates, it will not swerve. But it is the third part of the allusion—'who spurneth not at a dead dogge?'— that takes us furthest and most fruitfully into Nashe's reading of this episode, and discloses the meaning of both Spenser's historical allegory and Nashe's criticism of it. On their first arrival on the scene, the two sons of Acrates engage the Palmer in the same argument—over Guyon's honor—in which they later con- test Prince Arthur. Pyrochles, disdaining to be impeded by a weak and sanctimo- nious palmer, will not stay like his brother to argue, but pushes straight in: Good or bad (gan his brother fierce reply) What doe I recke, sith that he dyde entire? Or what doth his bad death now satisfy The greedy hunger of reuenging ire, Sith wrathfull hand wrought not her owne desire? Yet since no way is left to wreake my spight, I will him reaue of armes, the victors hire, And of that shield, more worthy of good knight; For why should a dead dog be deckt in armour bright? ( FQ II.viii.15) It is clear, given the intertextual conversation in which we can now situate this episode from The Faerie Queene, that Guyon's swoon, during which his detractors seem to despoil and dishonor his apparently dead corpse, functions as a historical allegory for Leicester's patronage of the precisian cause. Leicester's intemper- ance, like Guyon's weakness in the delve of Mammon and later in the Bowre of Blis, remained the Achilles heel of the Sidney-Walsingham faction at court, and their clients in Parliament. In the period after his death, Leicester's old causes were exposed to the mercy of his detractors, defended only by the ineffectual intervention of less powerful men, Palmer figures like Walsingham, Sir Francis Knollys, and Walsingham's brother-in-law Robert Beale. Nashe's brief comments on satire in his preface to the second edition of Pierce Penilesse rely on an intimate knowledge of canto viii of Book II of The Faerie Queene : the triple allusion to the guardian/evil angel, the 'metall' of Nashe's wit, and the 'dead dog'—for Nashe, as for Spenser, a reference to Leicester—position Pierce Penilesse as a satirical response to this episode from Guyon's quest. But why should Nashe take such careful pains to focus the reader's attention so precisely on a few stanzas from Spenser? Why should both authors associate Leicester with a 'dead dog'? And what has this to do with the interruption of the printing of The Faerie Queene in gathering T? The opening volley of Nashe's at- tack on Leicester in 1592, like Spenser's defence of Leicester in 1590, relies on a history of further intertextual associations, both Biblical and historical, that join Leicester's sexual intemperance to his political ambition. Anti-Leicestrian at- tacks proliferated in manuscript and occasionally print works throughout the late 1570s and 1580s; the most notorious example is the well-known 1584 The copy of a letter written by a Master of Art of Cambridge (or Leicester's Commonwealth, as it came to be known), which the Privy Council sought to suppress, and which spurred Sir Philip Sidney to the composition of a curious written defence of his maternal uncle. Leicester stood accused in Leicester's Commonwealth of having murdered his first wife, to make himself available to Elizabeth; of having poisoned the first Earl of Essex, so that he might marry Lettice Knollys, his wife; and of cajoling or enforcing many of Elizabeth's younger maids and ladies. The charge that he had poisoned Walter Devereux, Earl of Essex, in Dublin in 1577, made for particu- larly cunning libels from the intelligentsia, as Leicester could be associated in ap- parent innocence by a range of intertextual allusions with two other figures, one Biblical and one historical, who had cleared their way to a woman by making off with an inconvenient husband. King David, as recorded in 2 Samuel chapter 13, directed his general, Joab, to put Uriah the Hittite in the vanguard of an as- sault on Rabbah, so that, Uriah having been dispatched, David might take to him Uriah's wife Bathsheba, already pregnant with the king's child. The Roman emperor Heliogabalus, similarly, alienated his Praetorian guard by indulging in extravagant spectacles of underage sexual depravity with men, women, animals, and the wife of a man who he had specially murdered for the occasion. As Cas- sius Dio, Herodian, and Aelius Lampridius report, when the Praetorian Guard finally assassinated Heliogabalus, at age eighteen, they desecrated his body by dragging it about the streets of Rome before chopping it up and dumping it in a privy, after which it was flushed through a sewer to the Tiber. 27 27. On Heliogabalus's depravity, see for example Cassius Dio, Roman History, ed. and transl. Earnest Carey, 9 vols (London: Loeb, 1914–27), 80. 13; Cassius Dio relates the story of the emperor's assassination at 80. 19–20. Herodian's account of Heliogabalus appears in Book 5 of the History of the Roman Empire. Aelius Lampridius's description of the emperor's death, which stresses the desecration of his body, appears in The Life of Antoninus Heliogabalus, ed. David Magie (London: Loeb, 1924), c. 17. For Cassius Dio's accusation that Heliogabalus had Pomponius Bassus executed in order to court his wife, 'not allowing her even to mourn her loss', see Roman History, 80. 5. These two stories matter to Spenser because they became part of the stan- dard attack of Catholic libels on Leicester. The author of Leicester's Commonwealth, for example, has one of the interlocutors of his dialogue, the scholar, comment on Leicester's supposed escapades: I never heard nor read the like to this in my life, yet have I read much in my time of the carnality and licentiousness of divers outrageous persons in this kind of sin, as namely these whom you have mentioned before: especially the Emperor Heliogabalus, who passed all other and was called Varius, of the variety of filth which he used in this kind of carnal- ity or carnal beastliness. Whose death was, that being at length odious to all men, and so slain by his own soldiers, was drawn through the city upon the ground like a dog and cast into the common privy, with this epitaph: Hic projectus est indomitae et rabide libidinus catulus —Here is thrown in the whelp of unruly and raging lust, which epitaph may also one day chance to serve my Lord of Leicester (whom you call the Bearwhelp) if he go forward as he hath begun and die as he deserveth. 28 28. The Copy of a Letter Written by a Master of Art of Cambridge (Leicester's Commonwealth ), ed. Dwight C. Peck (Athens, Ohio: Ohio Univ. Press, 1985), p. 87. The author of this influential manuscript and print tract against Leicester pro- voked Sir Philip Sidney to write a defence of his uncle, which, crucially, picked up on the charge of Leicester's beastliness, and focused on the description of him as a 'dog' and a 'bearwhelp'. 29 29. See Sir Philip Sidney, Defence of the Earl of Leicester, in Miscellaneous Prose of Sir Philip Sidney, ed. Katherine Duncan-Jones and Jan van Dorsten (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973), pp. 123–141. Sidney takes pains to turn or rebut the associations made between Leicester and dogs in Leicester's Commonwealth, first likening Leicester's detractors to wolves who assail faithful hounds: 'The old tale testifieth, that the wolves that mean to destroy the flock hate most the truest and valiantest dogs. Therefore, the more the filthy impostume of their wolfish malice breaks forth, the more undoubtedly doth it raise this well deserved glory to the Earl, that who hates England and the Queen, must also withal hate the Earl of Leicester' (p. 130). Sidney then goes on to comment on the anonymity of Leicester's libeller by fingering his Catholic 'kennel' (p. 130), and to note that Leicester's restoration of the Dudley name (with its badge of the bear and ragged staff) has 'brought him to this case, that curs, for only envy, bark at' (p. 133). The association of Leicester with bears is a direct reference to the Dudley family badge—a bear and ragged staff—but it is also conveniendy linked to a well-known passage from 2 Samuel, chapter 17, where the counsellor Hushai dissimulatingly advises David's son Absolom not to attack his father in his flight, 'for … thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.' 2 Samuel is also the source, in two locations, for Spenser's two uses in Book II of The Faerie Queene of the derisive insult, 'dead dog'; the first Spenserian use comes in Trompart's submission to Braggadocchio in canto iii of Book II, which echoes the submission of Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, to David in 2 Samuel chapter 9, verse 8: 'What is thy seruant, that thou shouldest looke vpon such a dead dogge as I am?' 30 30. 2 Samuel 9: 8, here in the 1590 Geneva version (all further citations from the Old Testament will be from the same text). Mephibosheth's use of 'dead dogge' in his submission to Davidsarcastically echoes the earlier passage from 1 Samuel 24: 15, where David first makes the pact with Saul to preserve his house; David there laments to Saul, dissimulatively, 'After whom is the King of Israel come out? after whom doest thou pursue? after a dead dog, and after a flea?' The second Spenserian use comes, as we (like Nashe) have seen, in Pyrochles' impatient dismissal of the Palmer in canto viii of Book II, when the two sons of Acrates begin to strip Guyon of his arms. The emphasis here on the honor due to the fallen, in association with the use of 'dead dog', echoes the other place in 2 Samuel where the insult occurs, chapter 16, verse 9. Abishai offers to punish Shimei (a son of the house of Saul) for abusing David and throwing stones at him in his ignominious flight from Jerusalem, say- ing, 'Why doeth this dead dog curse my lorde the King? let me goe, I pray thee, and take away his head.' 31 31. 2 Samuel 16: 9. Where Pyrochles' dismissal of the Palmer invokes the example of David dis- honored by Shimei, Cymochles gets his turn at the same argument when he upbraids Arthur for intervening, this time invoking another source: To whom Cymochles said; For what art thou, That mak'st thy selfe his dayes-man, to prolong The vengeance prest? Or who shall let me now, On this vile bodie from to wreake my wrong, And make his carkasse as the outcast dong? ( FQ , II.viii.28) In repeating the argument, and making the association between the dishonor- ing of Guyon's body, on the one hand, and 'outcast dong' on the other, Cy- mochles moves the association from David to Heliogabalus—whose body, as we have seen, was hacked into pieces, thrown into a privy, and finally flushed through the sewers of the Tiber. When Arthur finally receives from the Palmer the sword of the fallen Guyon, and addresses himself to the fight, Spenser ties off the set of intertextual associations in an epic simile, recalling at once the 'bear whelp' of Leicester's Commonwealth and the whelpless bears and lions of 2 Samuel chapter 17: Then like a Lion, which hath long time saught His robbed whelpes, and at the last them fond Emongst the shepheard swaynes, then wexeth wood and yond…. ( FQ II.viii.40) As God delivered David from the revolt of Absalom, despite his sins and 'bloody deeds', so God, Arthur reasons, must be the one to judge Guyon's appar- endy posthumous honor. Unlike Heliogabalus, whose body had been disgraced and dismembered, and then made as 'the outcast dong' in a Tiberian latrine, Guyon's honor must be preserved. The intertextual associations make it obvious that, for at least the brief period of this episode, the fallen hero whom Arthur is defending is (at the level of the historical allegory) none other than Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, whose honor was still a sensitive political issue for the precisian preachers and divines (to say nothing of the poets) who had depended on his patronage. Crucially, too, Guyon will shordy wake from his apparent death, to carry on renewed with his quest; similarly, Ralegh (as it was thought in 1590) would take up the precisian cause. Where Pyrochles offers the example of David, and Cymochles the precedent of Heliogabalus, Arthur rebuffs them both, and preserves Guyon's honor and agenda—to fight another day. That Nashe should have fixed on this episode of The Faerie Queene, with its strong links to Leicester's Commonwealth, to Sidney's Defence, and to 2 Samuel and the various Roman histories of the reign of Heliogabalus, suggests that he as- sumed his readers would be able to reconstruct the intertextual associations on which his satire depended. This is not the far-fetched assumption it might at first seem: Leicester's Commonwealth circulated vigorously in the 1590s, 32 32. For a summary account of the circulation of Leicester's Commonwealth at court and abroad, and of its abiding influence on anti-Leicestrian satire in the period 1585–1605, see Peck, Leicester's Commonwealth, pp. 5–13. when it seems to have been as popular as in its early heyday of the mid 1580s; it was still con- sidered relevant enough in the early years of the seventeenth century to warrant Thomas Rogers's verse redaction in Leicester's Ghost (ca. 1601–1604). Similarly, the 'dead dog' passages from 2 Samuel continued to have important resonances, for Spenser at least, throughout the 1590s—and though it is a complicated story, it is worth pausing for a moment, with the patience of an archaeologist's brush, to excavate it. Frank B. Evans demonstrated as early as 1965 (in this journal) that Spenser introduced a substantial revision to Book V during the 1596 print- ing of The Faerie Queene, rearranging the last two cantos to accommodate new material allegorizing in the history of Sir Burbon the defection of Henri IV (i.e. of Navarre) from the Protestant faith. 33 33. See Frank B. Evans, 'The Printing of The Faerie Queene in 1596', Studies in Bibliography, 18 (1965), 49–67. As Evans showed, Artegall's meeting with Sir Sergis in canto xi of Book V—affecting stanzas 37—43—was added during printing as a transitional sequence that would enable Spenser to move the matter of Sir Burbon from canto xii back to canto xi. After this change was made (in some haste, it seems: note the clumsy transitional stanza 36 in canto xi of Book V), Spenser obviously forgot to update the argument to canto xii, which continues to suggest that the final canto includes both the Burbon material and the defeat of Grantorto. 34 34. It has occasionally been suggested that the canto arguments were devised by the printer, or some other hand, and are not Spenser's own. It is worth noting in passing that Evans's work on this late revision to Book V in 1596 suggests convincingly that Spenser was re- sponsible for the composition of the arguments: the survival of an unrevised argument indicates that the arguments were attached to the cantos before the poem arrived in the printing shop. As A. C. Hamilton has observed in his annotations to this passage, it is obvious that Spenser was interested in consolidating the mate- rial of canto xi—including the rescue of Belgae, or the Netherlands, by Arthur's hand—in order to provide a comprehensive account of Elizabeth's defense of Protestant causes on the continent. What Evans did not observe and Hamilton does not note, but which continues to make sense of the printing of the first part of the poem six years earlier, was that this material was almost certainly also moved back from canto xii so that Spenser might make space to accommodate an addition to the final canto—a set of stanzas not mentioned in the (unchanged original) argument to the canto, and one that appears after another obviously ter- minal, unaltered stanza. What is now stanza 27 of canto xii was almost certainly originally intended as the final stanza of Book V: Artegall 'through occasion' is called away from the reformation of Irena's government before completing his task, and the final alexandrine sounds the perfect, tight-lipped thud that Spenser would have wanted for Artegall's (failed) conclusion: 'So hauing freed Irena from distresse, / He tooke his leaue of her, there left in heauinesse.' Suddenly, though, a new section was available—the episode describing Artegall's return from the salvage island and defaming by the hags Envy and Detraction—beginning with another clumsy segue: 'Tho as he backe returned from that land …'. Fun- nily enough, this passage recalls again, six years later, the same episode from 2 Samuel, chapter 16 that had guided revision in 1590: Artegall's restraint of Talus in the final stanza 43 echoes David's restraint of Abishai, when he sought permission to punish Shimei of the house of Saul for throwing stones at David and reviling him: But Talus hearing her so lewdly raile, And speake so ill of him, that well deserued, Would her haue chastiz'd with his yron flaile, If her Sir Artegall had not preserued, And him forbidden, who his heast obserued. So much the more at him still did she scold, And stones did cast, yet he for nought would serue From his right course, but still the way did hold To Faery Court, where what him fell shall else be told. ( FQ V.xii.43) This time, no Prince Arthur is on hand to protect the honor of the reviled mag- istrate, as he passes back to the court of his sovereign, recalled, disgraced, and beaten. Much had changed since 1590 in the Protestant patronage circles in which Spenser had been wont to move: Walsingham had died, Grey had died, Ralegh had fallen from favor, Essex had been obliged publicly to disavow his precisian clients, Robert Beale (after his disastrous attack on the High Com- mission in the 1593 Parliament) had been exiled from court, and Sir Francis Knollys, the last surviving champion of Puritan causes on the Privy Council, had been silenced and banned from the Queen's presence, and had, in 1596, finally died. 35 35. The best account of the disintegration of the Puritan movement in these years, and with it the collapse of Spenser's patronage network, is still Patrick Collinson's magisterial The Elizabethan Puritan Movement (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1967). See particularly the final section of the book, 'Discovery, Prosecution and Dissolution', pp. 385–467. Those who had faithfully served Elizabeth's Protestant foreign and do- mestic policy had been ruined and impoverished, or were dead, and were being defamed; where Arthur had reassured the Palmer in 1590 that he could rely on him for his 'knights last patronage' ( FQ II.viii.26), no such patron was available in 1596. Spenser was determined to insert a complaint, and that complaint would refer the reader back, through its intertextual links with 2 Samuel, to the other magistrate so nearly left succourless in Book II, Guyon as the Earl of Leicester. Nashe's interest in canto viii of Book II in 1592 was surely motivated by his overall plan to set up Pierce Penilesse as an attack on Leicester and Ralegh based in a satirical account of the patronage fiasco of the 1590 edition of The Faerie Queene. Nashe may or may not have known that the printing of gathering T, which con- tains canto viii of Book II, was marred by some anomaly that probably indicates a slowing or even breakdown in the printing process; but he almost certainly recognized that Spenser had meticulously revised this part of the poem so as to include a pointed historical allegory defending the reputation of Leicester and allying that defence not only with Prince Arthur, but with one of the only direct Christian interventions, and certainly the most extended, in the entire gothic world of The Faerie Queene. The pattern of skeleton-forme usage in gathering T, as in A and B, and later in Cc, shows a doubling (here, of skeleton-forme III on both formes of the outer sheet; II was not used) that indicates that printing must have slowed, or perhaps even stopped. The psychology of this slowing is however to be distinguished from the likely unfolding of constraints and solutions in the earlier and later cases: where the doubling in gatherings A and B involved sheets from two gatherings that could be alternated on the two presses, keeping up the pace, and where the later doubling in gathering Cc was followed by a reverse of skeleton-formes I and IV in the imposition of the formes of the inner sheet from Dd (or, as we have seen, Ff) onward, in the case of gathering T it was skeleton- forme III, and not II, that was used to impose both formes of the outer sheet, with no corresponding shift in the use of skeleton-formes I or IV. As III would have been in use to impose the inner forme of the outer sheet of S during the setting of type for the first formes of T, it seems very likely that the delay evidenced in the doubling of skeleton-formes in gathering T was specifically associated with the outer sheet of the gathering—otherwise the compositors would have been able to use skeleton-forme II to impose the outer forme of the outer sheet during the printing of S, rather than waiting to impose the outer sheet until the printing of the outer forme of the inner sheet of T (using skeleton-forme I). The process of imposing the formes in gathering T, and in the adjacent gatherings, can be summarized as follows: Press 1 Press 2 C–S II→III I→IV T I ( β o ) III ( α i ) IV ( β i ) III ( α o ) V–Bb II→III I→IV A hitherto unnoticed mistake in the pagination in gathering V indicates that the inner forme of the outer sheet of gathering T was printed before the outer forme of the outer sheet. Position 8 r in gathering V reads '217' for '317', a mis- take that would have been impossible if the conservative compositors had reset running-title 15 from an immediately preceding use at position 8 r in gathering T (where the pagination reads '301'); the '2' of '217' is rather clearly retained from an immediately preceding use at position 7 r (page 299) of gathering T, where running-title 15 was used in the printing of the outer forme of the outer sheet. This particular '2', it should be noted, is different from the '2' that appears in the pagination for running-title 15 in position 8 r of gathering S; had the outer forme of the outer sheet of T been printed before the inner forme, we would have expected to see this '2' retained, but instead the '3' of'301' (at position 8 r of T) intervened. That the compositors did not then merely switch skeleton-formes II and III after printing the inner forme of the outer sheet of T, and continue print- ing at pace from that point, suggests that there was still residual lag, or some further delay, with the outer forme of the outer sheet, which was, again, imposed during the printing of the inner forme of the inner sheet (using IV), on skeleton- forme III; it is also possible that, having reduced production of the poem to a single press during this period, Wolfe had set up another short job on the idle press, which forced the compositors to work in straitened circumstances on the Spenser job until gathering V. It should be noted that, if the doubling effect in T had been merely the result of Wolfe's decision to co-opt one of the presses tem- porarily for another (concurrent) job, we should expect to find skeleton forme II in use for the outer forme of the outer sheet of T, and not III. When we map the bibliographical evidence of the sequence of printing in gathering T against what we have seen of the topical intertextual allusions of Book II, canto viii, the picture seems reassuringly clear: nearly all of the intertex- tual allusions to 2 Samuel, to the history of Heliogabalus, and to the anti-Leicester polemics like Leicester's Commonwealth occur squarely within the bounds of the inner sheet of T; the outer sheet contains, in its share of the latter half of the gathering, the fight between Arthur and the sons of Acrates, up to and including the epic simile of the 'robbed whelps' at stanza 40. Given that skeleton-forme II re-appears as usual in gathering V, and that its use throughout the rest of the printing is en- tirely consistent, it seems likely that the decision to use skeleton-forme III for both formes of the outer sheet of T was possible, and was ultimately taken, because the copy from which to set the gathering was not available when II became free, in the normal way, during the imposition of gathering S. The pattern of skeleton- forme use in gathering T, in short, indicates that the printing actually stopped be- fore T was printed. When it restarted, it proceeded for the space of one gathering on a single press; and the compositors for some reason completed setting the inner sheet first, followed (irregularly!) by the inner forme of the outer sheet—perhaps because the Argument to canto viii, which appears in position 2 v , in the outer forme of the outer sheet, was not yet complete. In any case, the confusion attend- ing the printing of T, and the salience of 'the canto viii problem', seem to have led the compositors to make one of the more prominent mistakes in the running-titles observed by Johnson: positions 1 r , 1 v , and 2 r of gathering T (running-titles 6 and 14, twice) all mistakenly read 'Canto VIII' for stanzas actually still part of canto vii. This is a mistake consistent with the fact that the outer forme of the inner sheet (fully within canto viii) was unusually the only thing printed, using skeleton-forme I, before the inner forme of the outer sheet was imposed; compositors used to mak- ing only partial changes to the canto headings across transitional formes could be forgiven, in the confusion of imposing gathering T, for forgetting that, having imposed a forme fully within canto viii, they needed to return to a forme only partly contained in that canto. It should be noted that it was during the printing of this gathering that skeleton-forme I was corrected by the addition of a period to 'The Faerie Queene' in running-title 10 (11), which may have something to do with the delays in this part of the printing, and with the recognition that these confusions had already led to careless mistakes. If anxiety about matters of 'patronage' led to the eleventh-hour revisions of Book II, canto viii, that later so exercised Thomas Nashe, it would not be the last time in the course of printing the poem that such anxieties would interrupt Wolfe's better business sense. Although the patterns of skeleton-forme usage seem to have no further secrets to divulge, a very odd error in pagination—duly ob- served by both Johnson and Yamashita et al., though not interpreted—suggests at least one further, perhaps final hiccup in the printing after the headache of gathering Cc. At position 8 v of gathering Ii, running-title 4 inexplicably reads '600' where it ought to read '510'. This is not the kind of mistake that a composi- tor would make if Ii were being printed sequentially after Hh (where the page number at position 8 v , the last time running-title 4 had supposedly been used, reads '494')—we might expect an error of '4' for '5' in the hundreds place, per- haps, but certainly not '600'. The mistake makes sense, though, when one places it next to position 5 v in gathering Pp, the 'final' gathering of 'prefatory' materials that Wolfe supposedly printed last; here the page number reads, in exacdy the same setting of type, '600'. As it happens, position 5 v in Pp corresponds exactly to position 8 v in Ii, if we assume that skeleton-forme II was used, between the imposition of gatherings Hh and Ii, to print Pp; in fact, no other explanation can plausibly account for this irregular mistake in pagination. Although it is unclear why Wolfe decided to interrupt the 'regular' sequence of printing after Hh in order to print Pp, it seems likely that the impetus came not from a need to produce the commendatory and dedicatory materials, but rather from a need to stall before the printing of Ii. Wolfe had already by this point left Dd and Ee aside, and would not return to them until after Nn, and he may thus have felt it unwise to skip Ii, as well. This gathering contains nearly all of Book III, canto vii—fewer than three stanzas at the end of the canto spill over onto the first page of gathering Kk. Wolfe must have had at least part of canto vii in hand, because the canto begins on 8 v of Hh, but it may be that the end of the canto was missing, or that Spenser had asked to make revisions. The narrative of Florimell's escape from the witch and her son, and of Satyrane's rescue of the Squire of Dames from the giantess Argante, would not seem at first glance particularly sensitive material that needed a timely reworking. Another possibility, of course, is that the decision to delay Ii was somehow associated with the earlier omission of Dd and Ee; Wolfe may have seized the opportunity to stall the printing after Hh in the hope that Spenser would complete and deliver the revisions to Dd and Ee at that point. Something, in any case, interrupted progress. What is far more problematic, and interesting, about this interruption is that this error in pagination supplies certain proof that all of the commendatory, dedicatory, and epistolary material that would go on to appear at the back of the poem was printed well before the end of the print run. The printing of Pp midway through Book III indicates that the disposal of the 'prefatory' material in a final gathering was certainly not an afterthought, but rather a deliberate choice, taken at a time when Spenser was obviously regularly in contact with Wolfe, or even physically present in the printing house. Given that the printing of the cancellans, gathering Qq, re-used the type from the relevant settings in Pp, 36 36. See F. R. Johnson, A Critical Bibliography of the Works of Edmund Spenser Printed Before 1700, p. 15. it seems tempting to assume that the printing of Qq followed directly after the printing of Pp: surely Wolfe's compositors would have needed to redistribute the type from the dedicatory sonnets before moving ahead with the printing of Ii. But in a printing house as well-stocked as Wolfe's, it may not have been neces- sary to do so, especially if the compositors came to anticipate a later revision to the dedicatory sonnets (perhaps because an irate or frustrated poet, hearing of the disordered imposition of his dedicatory materials, had insisted that further sonnets had been intended, and would soon arrive); 37 37. As Philip Gaskell notes in A New Introduction to Bibliography (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1972), pp. 116–117, was established practice, for a printer who needed or anticipated having to re-print a gathering, to lift the type by whole pages from the chase, bind it with a cord, and wrap it in paper until it was required again. and one piece of evidence suggests that, in fact, the printing of Qq did not take place until after the comple- tion of the rest of the volume. Had Spenser supplied Wolfe with the additions to the dedicatory sonnets immediately upon the completion of the printing of Pp, it seems likely that Wolfe's compositors would have reprinted the sonnets using the same skeleton-formes; because Qq has no pagination—the eight pages of the cancellans needed to replace a four-page cancellandum , and would therefore inevitably have thrown off the existent pagination—the compositors would have removed the '600' from its place in running-title 4 before printing the outer forme of the outer sheet of Ii. Had this number been removed, it would certainly not have been restored. The likeliest construction of events, then, seems to be that Wolfe ordered the dedicatory material printed before the imposition of Ii, perhaps because of a potential delay with that gathering, or because he was still trying to buy time for the completion of the material needed for Dd and Ee; but, finding that his peremptory production of the dedicatory materials was based on incomplete copy (regardless of whether Spenser himself had finished the sonnets, or not), that Wolfe determined at the end of the job to print a cancellans in order to recover the omitted dedicatory materials. The retention of standing type from Pp suggests that Wolfe was brought to recognize his mistake during, or immediately upon finishing, the printing of Pp. 38 38. This construction of the events surrounding the printing of gathering Qq is obviously at odds with much recent scholarship addressing the meaning and importance of the cancellans, and its 'revised' slate of dedicatory sonnets, to Spenser's attitudes to patronage issues. It might be argued that the present account fails to explain why some copies of the 1590 edition of The Faerie Queene have survived without the cancellans 'properly' inserted: surely, if Wolfe had been alerted as early as the printing of gathering Ii that he had been peremptory in producing the back matter for the poem, this would have left ample time, upon the production of gathering Qq at the end of the run, to make the necessary changes to every copy? On the other hand, it is possible that Wolfe simply supplied uncancelled copies, and that it was left to the binder or, indeed, purchaser to make up the copies as circumstances, and preferences, allowed; the wide variety of states in which surviving copies appear, even granted some later 'sophistications' along the lines posited by Jean R. Brink (see 'Materialist History', passim ), might suggest that no systematic attempt was made to cancel Pp6,7 in all copies. Whatever the fine details of the timing of the cancellandum and the cancellans , the pagination mistake evident in running-title 4 (at position 8 v in gathering Ii) seems to leave it indisputable that Spenser had a firm hand in the printing of the dedicatory materials, and that he was involved in the decision to place them at the back of the volume. He seems, too, to have planned this placement from the beginning. What is more, the confusion surrounding the imposition of these patronage-soliciting poems, along with 'A letter of the Authors … to Sir Wal- ter Raleigh' and the commendatory verses, went hand in hand with—and was probably caused by—similar kinds of confusion attending on other places in the printing of the poem, where Spenser seems to have withheld or amended his manuscript, during printing, in order to handle with particular care the deli- cate topical allusions and historical allegories shadowing the Queen, Ralegh, and Leicester. The overall picture that emerges from the physical witness of the printed book, with the bibliographical record of a disordered sequence of gath- erings, frequent and sometimes serious mistakes, and several periods of slowing or even stopping during the printing process, is one of miscommunication, last- minute revision, and a near desperation to position The Faerie Queene carefully with respect to the royal and aristocratic patrons who could help a rising poet, and lend support to the ideological positions and factions with which we now sup- pose him to have been aligned. Nashe's derisive mocking of the 1590 printing of The Faerie Queene in Pierce Penilesse, then, seems to have figured Spenser's travails shrewdly and exacdy. Bold to secure a royal dedication, bold to present his new epic to a gallery of powerful potential patrons, and bold to adjust his poem, even at the eleventh hour, to accommodate detailed topical allusion participating in contemporary religious and political factional debates, Spenser was perhaps too bold. By 1592, when Nashe took a gleeful swipe at Spenser's, and Ralegh's, for- tunes, the poet was in disgrace and all of his bids for preferment, like the glories of his Complaints, lay in ruins. Is it possible that I have created here merely another insubstantial 'house of cards', neatly but inconsequentially constructed from a chain of supposals? Any study that seeks to reconstruct historical events, much less the human inten- TABLE 3.

Four skeleton-formes were certainly very consistendy used through the printing of this volume, with only one substantial change intro- duced to a running-title over thirty-seven gatherings, and only one reversal of the orientation of a skeleton-forme; this alone does that prove that the edition was produced quickly, continuously, and at double press, with a single trio of compositors working in a dedicated fashion on this project alongside two teams of press-men. On the other hand, the coincidence of a pagination mistake across the outer formes of both sheets in gathering F suggests concurrent machining of these two formes at least, and, anyway, a system of four skeleton-formes makes most sense when working at double press. The decision to devote two presses to the job, especially considered in light of the regular nature of the stanzaic text, and the evidence of absolute consistency in setting and printing the volume, sug- gests speed; moreover, Wolfe printed the title-page of the volume on the recto of A1, giving the volume a publication date of 1590 right at the beginning of the printing process—which may suggest that he did not anticipate the kind of ex- tended, open-ended schedule characteristic of the concurrent printing practices described by McKenzie in 'Printers of the Mind'. The anomalies in the order of imposition, discussed extensively above and summarized in table 3, similarly indicate an impatience to get on with the job: why skip Dd and Ee, to return to them later, if the whole job might have been stalled until the copy was available? Why skip to the printing of Pp before Ii, except to keep production going dur- ing the period of confusion occasioned by the omission of Dd and Ee? As noted earlier, the job might have slowed between the printing of gatherings S and T, at least in part, due to the demands of some concurrent job in the printing house; but given that the inner forme of the outer sheet of T was, irregularly, printed first, that the allegorical material contained in gathering T was highly topical and sensitive, and the subject of Nashe's later jibes at Spenser, and that the dense literary and Biblical allusions of this part of the poem would again occa- sion late-stage revisions to Book 5 in 1596, it appears probable that we are not here witnessing a simple interruption of the Spenser job to take up some other, more pressing, printing project. In short, it is possible—as it always is—that the bibliographical evidence witnesses nothing more than a series of contingencies in a busy printing house; but the convergence of textual witness, allegorical content, biographical record, and contemporary response leads us, I think reliably, toward a series of meaningful interruptions—rather than mere discontinuities—in the printing of The Faerie Queene in 1590. A house of cards is also sometimes a house of cards. THE SHAKESPEARIAN PAVIER QUARTOS REVISITED by R. Carter Hailey * * I gratefully acknowledge the generous fellowship support provided by the Folger Shake- speare Library, the Bibliographical Society, and the Bibliographical Society of America, which permitted the delightful wanderings which were necessary to carry out the research for this essay. Though my debts are too numerous to mention individually, I would also like to thank the staffs of the many archives I have consulted, who have been consistently cooperative and helpful. I must, however, single out Elizabeth Walsh and the staff of the Folger Reading Room for their invariably intelligent and cheerful assistance in my research. And finally, I express my deep appreciation to the Council of the Bibliographical Society and its Hon. Secretary Dr. Margaret Ford for granting permission to reproduce W. W. Greg's watermark drawings from The Library. One hundred years ago W. W. Greg demonstrated that a group of Shake- spearian quartos that bore the various title-page dates of 1600, 1608, and 1619 and were attributed to several different printers and publishers had all in fact been printed by William Jaggard for Thomas Pavier in 1619. 1 1. Walter W. Greg, "On Certain False Dates in Shakespearian Quartos," The Library n.s. 9 (1908): 113–131, 381–409. The plays, two of them Shakespearian apocrypha, with their title- page dates are: The Whole Contention betweene the two Famous Houses, Lancaster and York (undated; a variant version of parts 2 and 3 of Henry VI with the two parts separately titled The first part of the Contention [A2 r ] and The second Part. Containing the Tragedie of Richard Duke of Yorke [I1 r ]); Pericles, Prince of Tyre (1619) [these first three titles have continuous signatures and thus a single STC number, 26101]; A Yorkshire Tragedie (1619; STC 22341); The Merchant of Venice (1600; STC 22297); The Merry Wives of Windsor (1619; STC 22300); A Midsommer nights dreame (1600; STC 22303); King Lear (1608; STC 22293); Henry the fift (1608; STC 22291); Sir John Old-castle (1600; STC 18796). I have listed the plays in the order in which I believe they were printed, but as I will argue below, throughout the project two or even three titles were being printed concurrendy. Greg casually states that "a happy inspiration led me to examine the paper upon which the quartos are printed"; he eventually distinguished twenty-six different watermarks as well as some unmarked stock and found that in a number of instances paper bearing the same watermarks appeared in quartos with different title-page dates. Suspicion of the Pavier quartos had already been aroused by the existence of several copies in which all nine titles were bound together, notably the copy of the seventeenth-century collector Edward Gwynn (now in the Folger Library) and the Capell copy at Trinity College Cambridge (now bound in two volumes). Additionally curious was the similarity of their title pages, with eight of the nine utilizing the same publisher's device of "a rose, a gillyflower and another flower on one stalk" and bearing as a motto the Welsh proverb "Heb ddieu heb ddim" ("Without God, without anything"). 2 2. Device number 283 in Ronald B. McKerrow, Printers' and Publishers' Devices in England and Scotland 1485–1640 (London: Bibliographical Society, 1949), p. 110. According to McKer- row the device had originally belonged to Richard Jones and was first used on the title page of Nashe's Pierce Penilesse (1592; STC 18371), printed by Charlewood for Jones, and then "Passed to William Jaggard in or before 1615." The MND title-page bears McKerrow's device 136, with the motto "Post Tenebras Lux," also obtained by Jaggard from Jones (p. 48). But Greg knew that the watermarks were the clinching evidence. He understood that handmade printing paper was an industrial commodity produced on moulds whose average lifespan was probably no more than a year and that paper was purchased ad hoc and in bulk by pub- lishers and/or printers for more or less immediate use. The earlier dates on the Pavier quartos must then be false. 3 3. The usual explanation for the subterfuge is that the King's Men were already in the early stages of planning for what would become the Shakespeare First Folio and, when they got wind of a potentially competing collection, took steps to protect their own project. Pavier and Jaggard responded not by abandoning their venture, but by disguising several of the quartos, issuing them with title pages bearing the dates of earlier editions, and passing them off as old, unsold stock. See Andrew Murphy, Shakespeare in Print: A History and Chronology of Shakespeare Publishing (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2003), pp. 36–41. A bit more than fifty years ago Allan H. Stevenson published his landmark study "Watermarks Are Twins" in which he emphasized the necessity of identi- fying and distinguishing the two individuals that make up the watermark pair, "the key" as Paul Needham has observed "to all adequate studies of handmade, watermarked paper." 4 4. Allan H. Stevenson, "Watermarks are Twins," Studies in Bibliography 4 (1951–52): 57–91. Paul Needham, "Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper," Studies in Bibliog- raphy 47 (1994): 23–64 (p. 29). The twinness of handmade laid paper—and unwater- marked papers are equally twins—is the result of the manufacturing process. Two individuals, the vatman and the coucher, worked together using a pair of paper moulds and a single deckle. The vatman dipped the mould fitted with the deckle into the vat of stuff, let it briefly drain, and handed it to the coucher who, passing the twin mould back to the vatman, then turned out the freshly made sheet onto a piece of felt. Thus passing the twin moulds back and forth, a competent team could turn out several thousand sheets a day. For watermarked papers, by far more common than unmarked for the earlier hand press period, each mould had a wireform sewn to its surface, bearing one of many designs that included unicorns, fleur-de-lis, pots, hands, and numerous others. The wireforms of the twin moulds were generally of the same design, though as with all such handmade artifacts, slight variation was inevitable, quite distinct variation not at all unusual. Stevenson also emphasized the mutability of the wireform: "every day of use tends to alter [its] shape," 5 5. Allan H. Stevenson, "Paper as Bibliographical Evidence," The Library 5th ser. 17.3 (Sept. 1962): 197–212 (p. 203). so that "a [water] mark may change in some difficult-to-describe particular while the detective pursues it from gathering to gathering of a pompous folio. Naturally, such changes limit the certainty of rec- ognition when he meets the mark in another book." 6 6. Stevenson, "Twins," p. 68. It should also be noted that watermarks are subject not only to gradual deterioration, but to sudden injury as well, as when a vigorous scrubbing distorts or breaks off a wire, or an accidental cudgeling from an ill-wielded deckle dents the crown of a pot. Stevenson briefly touches on the Pavier quartos in "Watermarks are Twins," commenting with characteristic ebullience that "It is pleasant to reexamine the watermarks that Sir Walter Greg discovered in the Shakespearian quartos of 1619" 7 7. Stevenson, "Twins," p. 80. —a pleasure I have shared. Although Greg understood that handmade paper was produced on pairs of moulds, he had been unaware that watermarks were twins, though (as I will argue below) he came tantalizingly close to this recognition. Stevenson notes that most of Greg's individual drawings in fact rep- resent pairs, but that "The RG Shields (Greg 15 &amp; 16) are themselves twins; [and] the RG/D Shields may be quadruplets. These matters are somewhat com- plicated and deserve separate treatment." 8 8. Stevenson, "Twins," p. 80. Stevenson never got around to that separate treatment, although in the same volume of Studies in Bibliography he did comment further on the Pavier quartos papers in a second essay, which famously begins, "On a perfect morning in July, when I might have been bowling on the greens at Arroyo Seco, I made a minor Shakespearian discovery." 9 9. Allan H. Stevenson, "Shakespearian Dated Watermarks," Studies in Bibliography 4 (1951–52): 159–164 (P. 159). In attempting to find twins for some of Greg's watermarks, Stevenson had discovered "several new marks to add to his list of twenty-seven." 10 10. Stevenson, "Shakespearian Dated Watermarks," p. 159. Among them were two that he believed, unusually for POT watermarks of this period, might bear dates. In gathering F of the Huntington copy of Sir John Oldcastle he found a mark that seemed to have 1608 just below the pot's top; in that library's copy of Henry V, he saw the possible date 1617 or 1619 (with the third digit having been lost to damage) in the belly of the pot found in gathering F. From the former he argued for the occasional admixture of long out-of-date papers in mixed stocks, perhaps in this case from Jaggard having "swept out his stockroom." 11 11. Stevenson, "Shakespearian Dated Watermarks," p. 163. If the date of the latter watermark were 1617, it would suggest "a proper interval after manufac- ture," if 1619, the paper "would have had to be made rather early in the year (in France)." 12 12. Stevenson, "Shakespearian Dated Watermarks," p. 163; p. 163, n. 17. I will return to these intriguing watermarks below. Nearly fifteen years ago, in his outstanding retrospective of Stevenson's ca- reer in paper, Paul Needham reviewed both Greg's and Stevenson's work on the Pavier quartos, in the course of which he remarked that "The paper stocks of the Pavier quartos remain incompletely described." 13 13. Needham, "Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper," p. 38, n. 22. It was this seemingly simple observation that set me off in the trail and giant footsteps of Greg and Stevenson. While I can make no claim to completeness, I have now examined about 180 individual Pavier quartos—between fifteen and twenty-three copies each of the nine quartos, 14 14. More is no doubt better, and I will continue to examine additional copies of the Pavier quartos as circumstances allow. Any additional data discovered can be conveniently added to the electronic footnote which will be available on the web site of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia: http://www.etext.virginia.edu/bsuva. There I will provide descrip- tions of all the watermarks I have encountered in the Pavier quartos and will reproduce the sequence and summary tables that appear in the appendixes below. or five times the number of copies that Greg had seen. Having examined a total of 1643 Pavier quarto gatherings, I found that Greg literally did not know the half of it. I have now identified well over 50 watermark pairs that are represented in the collective 81½ edition sheets of these quartos. And I'm certain that I still don't know all of it. But what, other than a nearer approach to completeness, is to be gained by a fresh examination of the papers of the Pavier quartos, especially given that Greg's conclusions about the false dates are not in doubt? First, the very complexity of the wildly mixed paper stocks offers an opportunity to define a methodology that is capable of dealing effectively with such a mass of often confusing data. A second and related purpose is to elucidate the myriad difficulties that beset the filigranologist in attempting to distinguish watermark pairs whose appearance is very like, in learning to recognize the same watermark in various states, and in accurately pairing twins in situations where a series of moulds bears similar watermark designs. A study of this sort is utterly dependent on the examination of multiple copies, and because they survive in large numbers (Needham estimates that there are as many as thirty of each title), the Pavier quartos can provide an especially useful account of the ways in which multiple paper stocks move though a printing house in a series of books that clearly were printed in rapid succession. Finally, by tracing the complex patterns of the paper stocks, I am able to provide new insights into the order and method of the printing of the Pavier quartos. I First it will be useful to consider in some detail what we know about the origin and nature of mixed paper stocks. It is worthwhile in this connection to quote at length Philip Gaskell's description of what is presented as a printer's typical procedure for acquiring and using paper: As a rule he took paper from particular lots for particular books, not from a general stock, for it was never normal for a printer to sink capital in a stock of paper sufficient for miscel- laneous book-printing. A batch of paper was specially ordered from a paper supplier for a particular book, the order generally being placed and the cost met by whoever was finan- cially responsible for printing it, be it a bookseller or the author, or the printer himself; alternatively the printer could buy the paper and charge it out with the sheets. Enough paper would normally be ordered at once for the whole edition (which was one reason why casting-off was an early necessity), and as far as possible it would be supplied as a single lot, of even size and quality and with a single watermark-design throughout. 15 15. Philip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography, (1972; repr. with corr. New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1975), p. 142. Gaskell goes on to note that although many early books are printed on more than one paper, the various papers usually appear in extended runs, and "batches of different papers would not as a rule be mixed," but paper left over from a job, and/or less-than-perfect "naughty" sheets culled from quires of paper, were sometimes used to eke out a main supply of paper. 16 16. Gaskell, New Introduction, p. 142. Such remnants, as opposed to runs, might be used in the middle of books where slightly defective paper would be less noticeable, or to print cancels or other resettings (as when fewer than the required number of sheets have been run off, or some accident spoiled part of the run of an edition sheet.) 17 17. Gaskell, New Introduction, pp. 142–143. For an extended consideration of the potential bibliographical significance of runs and remnants in printed books see chapter 6, "Runs and Remnants," in Stevenson's The Problem of the Missale Speciale (London: Bibliographical Society, 1967), pp. 71–99. Finally, in a cryptic footnote Gaskell remarks that "Not all printers (etc.) bothered about uniformity of paper in a book," 18 18. Gaskell, New Introduction, p. 142, n. 4. with no explanation of what this might mean in terms of his generalized account of the acquisition and use of printing paper. Is the implication that a book printed on mixed paper indicates a lack of care on the printer's part? My own investigations indicate that Gaskell's account requires considerable modification. When I began to study paper bibliographically I was vaguely aware from Greg's account of the Pavier quartos that mixed stocks of paper were sometimes used in producing hand-press books. Stevenson in fact begins "Watermarks are Twins" by stating that "Most early books are printed on a variety of papers. They contain a number of different watermarks," but goes on to assert that "that simi- lar wild mixtures" to those found in the Pavier quartos "are rare." 19 19. Stevenson, "Twins," pp. 57, 58. I was thus unprepared for the wild mixture of papers I found when I began to examine cop- ies of the three editions of Piers Plowman printed by Robert Crowley in 1550 (STC 19906, 19907, and 19907a). 20 20. See R. Carter Hailey, "Giving Light to the Reader: Robert Crowley's Editions of Piers Plowman (1550)," diss., Univ. of Virginia, 2001, pp. 173–322. The first edition was printed almost entirely on remnants: in the twenty-two paper copies examined (three others are printed on vellum) I found that twenty-four different paper stocks had been used in produc- ing its thirty sheets (twenty-nine full sheets and two half-sheets printed together). Individual gatherings were printed on as many as five different stocks, while only six gatherings appeared on a single paper. There is considerably more regular- ity in the second edition, where only eleven stocks were used—and in the third, where there are seventeen. In the latter two editions there are several substantial runs of paper, a feature generally absent in the first edition, and gatherings are much more likely to appear on a single paper stock. Seven paper stocks appear in two of the three editions, and three stocks can be found in all three. In total, at least thirty-nine different paper stocks were used to print the three editions— and thus at least seventy-eight individual watermarks. And nine of the water- mark pairs had their designs repeated in a second pair of moulds (a feature of the Pavier quarto papers, as will be seen below). But in the three Piers editions there is no discemable difference between the care taken by the printer with the first edition, which lacks significant runs of paper, and with the second and third. The mixing of paper stocks probably occurred at every stage of production, distribution, and use in the printing house. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, most of the ordinary printing paper used in England came from Nor- mandy and Brittany. As Stevenson notes, many of these paper mills were small, one-vat, family operations. A paper merchant or factor might make regular trips up and down the small streams where the mills were situated, picking up what- ever was available and, sorting by size and quality, combining it into larger units for packing and shipping to England. Stevenson speculated on other additional ways in which varieties might become mixed: "no doubt the piling into cargo boats, the unloading at London, the stacking in the warehouse of the London paper merchant and later on the shelves of the printer he sold the paper to—all this handling contributed to the mixture of papers we find in books. And much might happen in the laying out of tokens for the presses." 21 21. Stevenson, "Twins," p. 60. At the end of a par- ticular printing job the printer might return leftover paper to the warehouse, to be mixed with other small batches and used in future projects. Or the printer might have sold off such odd lots to a paper merchant who would have combined them with other remnants similarly acquired and then resold them, perhaps to be used for job printing or ephemera. At this stage we don't know what vagaries of these complex processes result in some books being printed on a single paper stock, others on slightly mixed stocks, still others on wildly mixed stocks. (All three occur in the Pavier quartos.) How did printer or publishers decide to print on homogenous paper or mixed paper? And why, within mixed paper volumes, do some gatherings appear on a single stock? Only a large-scale study of all ex- tant books printed over a lengthy period could even hope to answer these ques- tions. But, in contrast to Gaskell's suppositions, moderately mixed paper stocks may ultimately be found to be something of a norm, and wildly mixed stocks not at all infrequent. 22 22. For example, having examined five copies of the [1550?] edition of Chaucer's Workes (STC 5071–74; actually a single edition with a different colophon for each member of the four- man consortium of publishers), I distinguished sixteen different CROWN stocks mixed with two BEAR stocks. For a book of 181 edition sheets, I consider this a moderate mix. By contrast, in examining a single copy of John Marbecke's 1550 Concordance (STC 17300) I found fifty-six watermark pairs represented in its 202 edition sheets. II To deal effectively with the profusion of paper stocks found in the Pavier quar- tos requires a methodology that was unavailable to either Greg or Stevenson. Some twenty-five years ago, in an article that I believes stands with Stevenson's "Water- marks are Twins" in its importance for the study of handmade laid paper, David L. Vander Meulen provided a new method for achieving certainty of recognition. In "The Identification of Paper without Watermarks," Vander Meulen demon- strated that the measurement of chainlines could provide a unique identifier for the product of individual paper moulds. 23 23. David L Vander Meulen, "The Identification of Paper without Watermarks: The Ex- ample of Pope's Dunciad," Studies in Bibliography 37 (1984): 58–81. Unlike sewing dots 24 24. Stevenson had discovered that for incunabular watermarked papers the unique pat- tern of sewing dots—the points at which the wireform was fastened to the mould with relatively coarse sewing wire—persisted even as the watermark deteriorated around them, providing a ready means for identifying the same mark in variant states. But sewing dots are rarely visible in later papers when the sewing wire had become finer and eventually the wireforms, rather than being attached at discrete points, were sewn continuously to their moulds. See The Problem of the Missale Speciale, p. 35. —or watermarks themselves for that matter—chainlines "are present in every leaf of handmade paper manufactured before the introduction of wove paper in the later eigh- teenth century." 25 25. Stevenson, Problem of the Missale Speciale, p. 60. Since the spacing between chainlines is rarely if ever entirely regular, chainspace models—produced by the careful measuring, recording, and ordering of chainspaces to reflect their original arrangement across the length of the sheet—can serve as a fingerprint for the mould. This is so because there is nearly always somewhere in the sequence of spaces some distinctive pattern of narrower and wider spaces that can serve as a sort of genetic marker (as can the highly unusual pattern of absolute or near regularity). Chainlines result from the impression of the fine sewing wires that tie the laid wires together. Since they are secured at intervals of approximately 5–10 mm to the supporting wooden ribs, chainlines are much less likely to shift their position or deteriorate than are wa- termarks, and hence are much more stable over the life of the mould. The truth of this can be seen by comparing regular chainlines to tranchefiles—"an extra wire between the final chain wire and the frame of the mould." 26 26. Stevenson, Problem of the Missale Speciale, p. 64. Unlike the other chains, tranchefiles are not attached to a rib, and anyone who has measured chainspaces extensively will have noticed that tranchefiles wander more from top to bottom of the sheet, and are subject to much greater variation, than their more firmly anchored fellows. Chainlines may also, though less conspicuously, wander from each other as they traverse the sheet. For this reason chainspaces should consistently be measured across what was originally the center of the sheet, whatever the format of the book. Folios are measured across the middle of the leaf, quartos in the gutter, octavos along the top edge, etc. The state of the chainlines themselves will remain relatively stable, even as the watermark goes through a number of successive states because of damage or wear. I have found chainspace models to be particularly valuable in helping to establish the identity of watermarks in variant states, and thus to avoid the misidentification of water- marks in different states as different watermarks. While Vander Meulen devel- oped his method for the identification of unwatermarked papers, the chainspace model is perhaps even more powerful when combined with a watermark image, a combination I have dubbed the "mugshot and fingerprint" method, following the apt suggestion of David L. Gants. 27 27. "Identifying and Tracking Paper Stocks in Early Modern London," Papers of the Biblio- graphical Society of America 94.4 (2000): 531–540 (p. 532). Before I move to a discussion of the Pavier quarto papers, I will explain in some detail my method for collecting and displaying the data that I use to describe watermarked papers. And let me first reassure would-be paper detec- tives that when stalking the wild filigrane they need arm themselves with only a thin, flexible, plastic ruler with a millimeter scale. Or perhaps two—I find it handy to have both a 6″ and 12″ caliber ruler available. Frequent reference to figure 1, which illustrates Greg's marks 1 and 14 (a single pair), will make the following discussion clearer. First, I believe that it is essential always to view and reproduce watermarks from the same side of the sheet, regardless of whether initials, if present, are right reading or not. Consistency helps to avoid confusion. While arguments are sometimes made for viewing from the mould side on the analogy of a printed sheet being the mirror image of the forme, my own prefer- ence is to view from the felt side, which is the equivalent of looking down on the paper mould. 28 28. I initially made this determination from an examination of the mixed stocks used to print Robert Crowley's three editions of Piers Plowman (STC 19906, 19907, 19907 a, all dated 1550). Of the seventy-eight individual watermarks encountered, a majority of those which bore initials were right reading from the felt side. Examination/description from the felt side is also preferred in the Watermark Registration Standard of the International Association of Paper Historians, Section 3.0.17: "It is recommended to collect data with the wire side facing down." See http://www.paperhistory.org/standard.htm. It is thus first necessary to determine the mould and felt side of FIGURE 1. Watermarks 1\14; BPOT: LE (?). the sheet by examining the leaves with a raking light to find the side that bears indentations from the chain and laid wires and the wireform of the watermark. This may on occasion be a simple task, with the chain indentations appearing almost like furrows from a plow; at other times, especially if the book has been washed and pressed, it may be considerably more difficult, even unachievable, though an experienced researcher will grow more sensitive to subtle clues. Once the felt side has been identified it is necessary to determine the leaves and sides of the leaves which must be measured to yield the full chainspace model (I call these the complementary leaves). Most watermarks have a definable right-side- upness, which helps to establish the correct orientation from which to measure chainlines. 29 29. Not all watermark designs have a definable up and down, though POTS, which pre- dominate in the Pavier quartos, clearly do. The watermark can appear in either half of the sheet. In watermark pairs the marks are frequently placed in opposing halves of the sheet, but pairs with both marks to the left or both to the right are not at all uncommon. In the three Crowley Piers editions, of thirty-nine watermark pairs, thirty-four had one twin with the mark to the right (R), the other with the mark to the left (L); two pairs were R/R; three pairs were L/L. In the Pavier quartos, of the thirty-six pairs where I have identified both twins, twenty- three were R/L; six were L/L; seven were R/R. (In order to follow my explanation, it may be helpful at this point to get out a sheet of ruled paper and fold it as a quarto.) In quarto, measurements can be taken from four possible orientations of the sheet, as viewed from the felt side and with the watermark right-side up: 1 v /2 r ; 2 v /1 r ; 3 v /4 r ; 4 v /3 r . Once I've es- tablished the felt side of a quarto sheet, I turn the book sideways and find the leaf that has the top half of the watermark. If, for example, the top of a POT appears in 4 r when viewed from the felt side, I know that by measuring from left-to-right in the gutter first of 3 v , and then, having rotated the book 180 degrees, left-to- right in the gutter of 4 r , I can put the two halves together in the sequence 3 v /4 r to produce a chainspace model of the whole sheet before folding (less whatever portion is lost to trimming), as viewed from the felt side and reading from left to right. Similarly, if the top of a HAND appears in 2 v when viewed from the felt side, I know to measure the sequence 2 v /1 r . A bit of reflective origami will show that, oriented from the felt side, if the top of a mark appears in the verso of a leaf it will be a left-hand mark, if in the recto, a right-hand mark. Measurements are conveniently done to the nearest half-millimeter, since, as Vander Meulen notes, chainlines are approximately one millimeter wide and an easy discrimina- tor when measuring is whether the chain falls on or between millimeter markings on the ruler. 30 30. Vander Meulen, "Identification," pp. 60–61. Whenever possible I gather chainspace data from seven to ten examples of a given mark and transfer the measurements to an EXCEL spreadsheet that I use to produce a composite model by averaging the measurements for each individual space. I include in my descriptions the number of exemplars that have gone into making up the composite model (note this is not the total number encountered of a particular mark; these totals will appear in the summary tables in the appendixes). While a model made up from seven or eight exemplars will be somewhat more accurate than one with only two or three, even a model built with only a few exemplars will usually permit certainty of recognition. Once a composite chainspace model has been built, it is easy to determine how many ribs the mould had by counting the number of non-tranchefile chainlines. In the present example the tranchefile at the right end of the "a" twin is excluded, and, since the measurements on either side of the gap in the middle of the model add up to nearly the average chainspace width, it is apparent that no chainline has been lost. Thus the B POT: LE (?) moulds had eighteen ribs. Having formed the composite model, I then establish the average width of all full non-tranchefile chainspaces. The average chainspace width for a pair of moulds is generally exceptionally close, in the present example, B POT: LE (?), a difference of only .08 mm. The reason, upon reflection, is fairly obvious. A mouldmaker must produce twin moulds of identical size so that so that a single deckle will fit both. Although the spacing of the supporting wooden ribs will generally vary slightly in the two moulds—and that is their great evidentiary value— they will both have the same number of ribs, and thus their average spaces will usually be quite close. (Average widths for a pair of moulds will tend to be closer when the composite models from which they are extracted have a larger number of exemplars.) Average chainspace widths are of particular value in correctly pairing twins when a watermark design, say a POT with the initials IM on its belly, has been repeated in a series of mould pairs. 31 31. While the two individuals in a pair of moulds will have nearly identical average spaces, the spacing of ribs, and thus of chainlines, can vary widely from mould pair to mould pair. I have found pairs with average spaces as narrow as 18 mm, and as wide as 35 mm. In displaying the composite chainspace model I use the following conventions. Vertical strokes indicate chainlines, and the numbers between them are the chainspace measure- ments; I indicate the position of the watermark in the sequence by bolding and italicizing the measurement of the space between its attendant chainlines. If the mark is centered between chainlines, as are nearly all of the Pavier examples, a typical sequence will appear like this: 32 32. Note that in this model we can determine from the widths of the partial spaces in the middle of the model that a chainspace has been lost; like the B POT: LE (?) pair this mould had eighteen ribs. 5.5 | 20 | 23.5 | 22.5 | 21.5 | 19.5 | 21 | 21.5 | 21 | 14} {17.5 | 20 | 22.5 | 21 | 20 | 21 | 20 | 20.5 | 20 If a mark is centered between chainlines, the typical sequence appears like this: 33 33. And the principle can be extended for larger watermarks, which may spread them- selves over a number of chains. 19 | 18.5 | 18.5 | 20 | 18 | 19 | 19 | 19 | 20.5 | 17} {18.5 | 18.5 | 20 | 20 | 19.5 | 20 | 19 | 20 | 18 | 17 Braces indicate a gap or gaps in the model. In quarto, the gap in the middle of the model represents the slight loss occasioned by the opening and trimming of the top edge during binding. (Very occasionally the combination of copies allows for a quarto model with no center gap.) Chainspace models for folios will also have a single gap, in this case representing the part of the sheet that is hidden in the gutter. Octavo models will have three such gaps, two from gutter loss, one from opening and trimming the fore-edge. The measurements before and after the gap are the widest encountered at those positions, and the measurements at either end of the model are from the largest copy examined; if a deckle edge is pres- ent in any copy, it can be designated by a percent sign (%). 34 34. Of the more than 1600 Pavier quarto sheets examined, I have seen deckle edges on only six occasions. I include one fur- ther measurement in my watermark descriptions, the wireline density per 3 cm. Wireline density is a measure of the number of fine laid wires that run perpen- dicular to the supporting ribs and form the sieve of the mould. I have found papers with as few as 22 and as many as 40 wirelines per 3 cm, though as with average chainspace widths, the two individuals in a pair of moulds will exhibit similar densities. Once I have measured the chainspaces I make a careful freehand drawing of the watermark, and in the description I note the copy, gathering, and ori- entation from which the drawing has been made. If beta-radiographs or digi- tal photographs are available, so much the better, but a reasonably accurate drawing will suffice since it is the combination of mugshot and fingerprint that permits positive identification. When a watermark appears frequently, such as Greg's 23, which is present in every gathering of every copy of The Whole Conten- tion, I can be selective about the exemplar I use for the drawing, searching for a less tightly bound copy and for leaves in which the watermark is relatively clear. With a rarely occurring mark, I simply draw whatever I can see, and hope to run across a better exemplar in another copy. Since quarto watermarks are inevitably divided by the gutter and are usually at least partly obscured by the type, it is possible to produce a more complete drawing by conflating images from several exemplars that are positioned slightly differently in respect to the gutter. I find this, however, to be a dangerous and unnecessary expedient, since it is all too easy to conflate drawings from various states of the watermark, thus falsifying the evidence. As with the chainspace model, a bit of indeterminacy in the middle of a drawing is no bar to positive identification with the mugshot and fingerprint system. When I have created the mugshot and fingerprint for a paper stock, including a composite chainspace model from at least seven examples of each twin, I can move from collection to identification. Once the product of a mould pair can be positively identified, there is little to be gained by collecting additional chainspace examples, though additional drawings may be useful if a particular mark is encountered in clearly variant states. I have developed a system of reference notation for naming watermarks, es- sentially to serve as a shorthand mnemonic for categorizing the large number of watermarks that are encountered in books printed on heavily mixed paper stocks. These references are not intended to serve as formularies, since no formulary I have encountered can be used by itself to identify a particular watermark in another setting. That is the job of the full mugshot and fingerprint description. A sample reference, in this case for Greg's mark 2, would read: B POT: R/LM. The initial superscript indicates whether the watermark is centered on (O) or between (B) chainlines (in the Pavier quartos all but Greg's 15\16 are centered between chainlines). The second element identifies the basic design of the water- mark, following which I add particular distinguishing features like the initials R over LM that appear on the belly of this POT. If the initials are uncertain, I follow them with a query. Such is the case with Greg's 22, where he sees the initials as BP but where in my own drawings they appear more likely to be PR. Sometime there are what appear to be initials, but they are so indistinct as to be unidentifiable. Here I simply substitute queries for the (presumed) letters. In other cases, especially when no initials are present, I may add several words of description; for example one of the new marks I encountered is dubbed " B POT: neck w/vertical stripes." As will be shown below, some of Greg's drawings actu- ally represent more than one pair in circumstances where the manufacturer has repeated a design in a second (or more) set of moulds. In this situation I mimic software manufacturers by adding a .1, .2, etc., to the descriptor; for example, Greg's mark 6 turns out actually to be two pairs bearing a similar design: B POT: GL.1 and B POT: GL.2. If I need to refer specifically to one or the other twin rather than the pair as a whole, a final superscript "a" or "b" distinguishes the two twins that make up the watermark pair: B POT: R/LM a and B POT: R/LM b . Since the default for watermark pairs is to have one twin's mark centered in the right half of the sheet, the other in the left (see note 26 above), in the absence of a following discriminator, the "a" twin may be assumed to be a right mark, the FIGURE 2.

Greg's drawings of 24 show the initials J1 and for 27 the initials C/LG; both were made from copies of MND . My own drawings, also from MND , are more am- biguous. The similar pair 24/27.2 appears, with one exception, only in MWW ; again the initials are unclear and ambiguous. 25 B SPROUT 26 B DIAMOND/FLEUR: NV Greg's drawing is upside-down; he sees the V as an A. 28 B CROWN: PD 29 B POT: neck with H 30 B POT: neck with vertical stripes 31 B POT: MP 32 B POT: C/DC 33 B HAND: PA 34 B POT: MV 35 B POT: LDB 36 B POT: P/AV 37 B POT: ??

This is the other of Stevenson's "Shakespearian Dated Watermarks." "b" twin a left mark. In cases where both marks are centered in the same half of the mould I add a [L] or [R] to the twin that does not match this default: i.e. in a pair with both twins centered to the left 1 add an [L] to the reference for the "a" twin: B POT: BL a [L]; in a pair with both twins centered to the right 1 add a [R] to the reference for the "b" twin: B SHIELD: RG b [R]. For ease of comparison with Greg's watermark drawings, which are repro- duced in figure 2, and simply to conserve space in the sequence and summary tables that appear in the appendixes, I have retained and extended Greg's system of numbering. In table 1 I first give Greg's number, followed by my own refer- ence. Where two of Greg's drawings turn out to be twins, I indicate the pair with a backslash between the numbers: 1\14, etc. Where a single Greg drawing or pair of drawings actually represents multiple pairs with similar designs I add the .1, .2, etc., to the number(s). Numbers higher than 27 indicate marks not found by Greg, nearly all of which appear very rarely in the Pavier quartos. The only significance to the numbers themselves is that they indicate, for the most part, the sequence in which the watermarks were encountered. III In the article that motivated me to undertake this study, Paul Needham pre- dicted what a more complete investigation of the Pavier quarto paper stocks might discover: Under an awareness of twinship, the situation obviously changes markedly, though Greg's argument from paper retains all its strength. Greg recorded 27 "different" marks, mostly Pots, in four sets of the quartos: thus four copies each of the 81½ edition sheets, or about 310 watermarks (subtracting unwatermarked sheets). Simple probability suggests that within these parameters various consequences become highly likely. First: some of the recorded marks will surely pair off as twins; the number of stocks represented by the drawings must be less than 27. Second: there will very probably be twin marks either that did not turn up in this relatively small sample, or that Greg overlooked because their dif- ferentia are inconspicuous. Third: there could well be fugitive stocks that do not happen to show up in these four copies. After all, nine of the watermarks recorded by Greg appear in his sample in three or fewer examples each. 35 35. Needham, "Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper," p. 38. Needham's predictions have turned out to be remarkably accurate. Indeed several of Greg's drawings do pair up as twins; I have been able to identify twins for all marks illustrated by Greg that are not themselves twins of other Greg drawings; and there are indeed quite a number of "fugitive stocks," watermarks that Greg had not encountered, including Stevenson's "dated" watermarks. An additional and offsetting phenomenon that Needham could not have predicted is that, perhaps paradoxically, Greg's drawings represent, at least in a sense, not fewer than twenty-seven pairs, but considerably more. This is so because, as I have noted, paper manufacturers often repeated the "same" design in a series of mould pairs. (I use the word "same" guardedly, because of course the designs are never identical 36 36. It is thus risky at best to try to identify a watermark by saying that it is "like" a mark in the Briquet, Churchill, or Heawood watermark catalogues. Is the mark in question literally identical to the one pictured, is it a twin of that mark, or from an entirely separate set of moulds perhaps produced years before or after the mark adduced? The utility of these catalogues for identification is thus extremely limited. and similar pairs can be distinguished by their chainspace models.) Thus for example Greg's drawing No. 4 turns out to represent four dif- ferent mould pairs, all with the "same" POT: w/fleur top design. I will now describe in more detail the several situations I encountered in comparing Greg's drawings with the results of my own investigation. The most unproblematic situation is where one of the drawings represents a single pair; that is the case with numbers 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 13, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26. As can be seen in the summary table in appendix 3, some watermark pairs, like 2 and 5, occur quite frequently and appear in several of the quartos (these were thus among the marks that were particularly valuable to Greg in exposing the false dates), while others, like 3, 8, 9, and 13, occur in only one or two gatherings of a single play. Other categories, however, present considerable complexity. Ten of Greg's drawings pair up as twins: 1\14; 10\11; 12\19; 15\16; 24\27 (the fourth of these pairs had been identified by Stevenson.) How can I be certain of these pairings, especially in the case of 1\14, where Greg's I shows no initials in the pot's belly while his 14 bears the initials LE, and my own drawing of I has vertical lines in the belly, my 14 with indeterminate initials (see figure 1)? After the gathering of mugshots and fingerprints, the most important evidence for pairing twins is their distribution in a printed book or books. In the simplest situ- ation, if two individual marks of similar design, with similar average chainspaces and wireline density, appear in a number of consecutive gatherings—a run —it is highly probable that they came from twin paper moulds. One should not of course expect them to alternate regularly or even necessarily to appear in a 50/50 ratio. Although the workings of probability dictate that in a long book printed on a run of a single paper stock each of the twin marks will appear roughly half the time, it is not at all uncommon in shorter runs for one of the twins to dominate. I have occasionally found eight or nine examples of one twin before encountering the other. Chance is chancy, though as Tom Stoppard wittily illustrates in the opening scene of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, no matter how many times in a row heads has been thrown, the odds on the next throw remain 50/50. On the other hand, in dealing with books that are printed on remnants, as are most of the Pavier quartos, where changes in paper stocks are frequent and individual gatherings may appear on more than one stock, one must examine multiple cop- ies to begin reliably to pair twins. But again, if two marks of similar design and measurements regularly appear in a particular gathering or gatherings, the prima facie evidence is that they are twins. In gathering 2A of Pericles, sixteen of twenty-three copies examined have either the 1 or 14 mark; in gathering H of Merchant of Venice, thirteen of fourteen copies have one or the other. Despite their variable appearance both from each other and from different examples of each individual, average chainspace mea- surements combined with the distribution evidence indicate that 1 and 14 are a pair. Greg was rightly perplexed by these (and several other) watermarks, as indicated by his notes to the drawings: "It is not absolutely certain whether Nos. 1 and 14 and 24 and 27 are really distinct or not. On the other hand Nos. 18 and 20 may be capable of being resolved." In 1 and 14 Greg had encountered variant states of both watermarks, with the wires that had formed whatever letters origi- nally appeared in the bellies of both pots bending, breaking, and in number 1 finally falling away entirely. On the other hand the basic designs of the two were relatively stable and similar. Without the knowledge of watermark twinness or a means for recognizing the same watermark in variant states, the situation was un- derstandably baffling. Yet Greg's instincts were correct that both 1\14 and 24\27 were somehow connected. And if his use of the word "resolved" with reference to numbers 18 and 20 means "separated, broken up, analyzed" (OED, sense 7), he appears to have intuited that these individual marks might actually be two. Greg seems to have been very close to discovering that watermarks are twins. Greg's 10\11, both fleurs-de-lis, are uncomplicated, but the other pairs repre- sented in Greg's drawings—12\19, 15\16, and 24\27—require additional atten- tion since for each of the three there is in fact a second set of marks with similar designs. In considering these pairs it is worth returning to Stevenson's statement that "The RG Shields (Greg 15 &amp; 16) are themselves twins; [and] the RG/D Shields may be quadruplets." 37 37. Stevenson, "Twins," p. 80. Particularly notable is his characteristically offhand but provocative suggestion that watermarks might, in some instances, be quadruplets. Stevenson apparently encountered, as I have, a third pair of SHIELD: RG water- marks in copies of Sir John Oldcastle . Because of their size, he noted their similarity to 18, and, perhaps playfully, suggested quadruplets. (Greg states in the notes to his drawings that "18 is really considerably larger" than 15 and 16.) The new set of marks is, other than size, actually closer to 15\16, sharing the distinction of being the only other Pavier quarto mark to be centered on chainlines rather that between them. I have therefore designated the two as 15\16.1 ( o SHIELD: RG.1) and 15\16.2 ( o SHIELD: RG.2). Does the distribution evidence suggest quadru- plicity? Probably not. The pair 15\16.1 appears in some copies of H5 gatherings E, F, G, and in most copies of Oldcastle gatherings A and B; 15\16.2 begins to appear in gathering D of Oldcastle and is also found in gatherings E, F, H, and I, always mixed with 15\16.1, and always in a distinct minority. The distribution thus suggests not quadruplets but a second set of twins, perhaps odd sheets used as cording quires, possibly left over from a pair of moulds that had worn out. Greg's 12\19– B POT: GG.1 and B POT: GG.2—not only presents the ques- tion of quadruplets but also illustrates nicely a problem that I had encountered before in the Crowley Piers Plowman papers. As can be seen in figure 3, each pair consists of one POT with a floppy top and wide base, and one with a skinny top and narrow base. If one were to judge by appearance alone, a reasonable as- sumption would be that the two floppy tops and two skinny tops are the twins. But the average chainspace widths show this not to be the case. The distribution of these two pairs is intriguing (see the sequence table of watermarks in individual plays in appendix 2). In Henry V gathering A, I encountered seventeen examples of Pair 1 and only two of Pair 2. But in Lear there is a greater balance; in the examined copies gathering F had Pair 1 in seven, Pair 2 in thirteen, and in gath- ering H thirteen of Pair 1 and six of Pair 2. In total I found thirty-one instances of Pair 1 and twenty of Pair 2, a relatively even balance considering the size of the sample. It is of course possible that the distribution in H5 gathering A is a statistical anomaly, and that were the sample great enough that there would be a relatively even mix of the two pairs in all three gatherings. But this can be only speculative, because sufficient evidence is not extant. And even if it were, watermarks are not literally quadruplets. Although in the present example gath- erings F and H of Lear certainly give that appearance, the measurements indicate two distinctive pairs of moulds. How then might such mixtures come about? Although the predominant sources of paper for the English printing trade had only one vat, there were presumably a few larger establishments that possessed two or more. 38 38. Stevenson, "Twins," p. 59 and p. 59, nn. 9 and 10. Papetieres with more than one vat might on occasion have used two pairs of moulds with similar designs simultaneously, indiscriminately mixing the sheets as they were dried, sized, and packed for shipment. It is even possible that in some mills the product of two vats was turned out onto on a single post, a procedure that would have distinct advantages in completing the post more quickly and would result in the appearance of watermark quadruplets. But even in such cases, average chainspace widths might distinguish the original twins. Greg's numbers 24 and 27 are the last of the twins represented in his draw- ings that turn out actually to be two pairs, both shapely two-handled pots sur- mounted by an arrangement of small balls in a diamond shape, and surmounted by a crescent. Greg's 24 shows the initials JI in the belly, his 27 bearing the initial C/LG. In no example I have seen are these initials clear, or even clearly initials, though there is some sort of design in the belly of all four individuals of these related pairs. Here distribution is a key to correctly pairing the twins, since, with the exception of a single example of 24\27.2 in MND , 24\27.1 appears only in MND , 24\27.2 only in MWW . The most difficult situation I encountered was that in which a single Greg drawing was found to represent multiple pairs: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 ("a" twin only); 6.1, 6.2 ("a" twin only); 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 ("a" twin only), 7.4 ("a" twin only); 20.1, FIGURE 3. Watermarks 12\19.1 and 12\19.2; B POT: GG.1 and B POT: GG.2. 20.2. As with the other multiple pairs I was able to identify and distinguish simi- lar watermarks and pair twins on the basis of average chainspace measurements and distribution. All four pairs of the Greg 4 POTs have similar fleurs-de-lis chapeaux balanced precariously on top. The most frequently occurring pair, 4.1 ( B POT: fleur top.1; see figure 4), appears regularly in gatherings C, D, and G of MWW (with a few strays found in MND and MV ); the newly discovered 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 all appear in either/both MWW gatherings C and D. These seeming wa- termark octuplets would be nearly impossible to distinguish without chainspace measurements and their averages: 4.1 average 21.13 and 20.88; 4.2 average 23.27 and 23.27; 4.3 average 19.50 and 19.84; 4.4 average 22.88. FIGURE 4. Watermark pair 4.1; B POT: fleur top.1. Fortunately, the first three have such distinct averages that the pairings are clear. On the basis of average alone, the single example of 4.4 might possibly pair with one of the 4.2s, but watermarks are not triplets and its twin remains a fugitive. The four pairs represented by Greg 7, a crescent-crested pot bearing the initials C/DV, present a slightly different situation. Pair 7.1 occurs regularly and predominantly in Pericles gathering X and MV gathering C; the other three pairs, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4, are more scattered, lurking mostly by twos and three in the gutters of assorted sheets of MND, MWW, MV, and Lear. In contrast to the Greg 4 POTs, I have found no gathering in which all four pairs are present. But again distribution (for 7.1) and average chainspace width permit pairing, and while the average for 7.3 is close to that of 7.2, its chainspace model is distinct: 7.1 average 22.09 and 21.95; 7.2 average 21.57 and 21.65; 7.3 average 21.45; 7.4 average 24.23. The two remaining cases where a single Greg drawing represents multiple pairs are, by contrast, fairly straightforward. The only examples of a second pair of Greg 6 watermarks ( B POT: GL.2), both of the same individual, were found in gathering F of the Trinity Cambridge and National Library of Scotland copies of MWW . Greg saw the Trinity copy, but understandably did recognize that it was different from the examples he had seen in five other Pavier quartos. The chain- space models of 6.2 are, however, quite distinct from the 6.1 pair. The two pairs represented by Greg's 20 are distinguished not only by their chainspace models, but, in contrast to the Greg 4s and 7s, by a mutually exclusive distribution pat- tern: 20.1 is found only in gatherings I and L of Lear, 20.2 only in gatherings B and C of H5 . Not only do some of Greg's drawings represent multiple marks, but Greg o: "NO WATER MARK" comprises several identifiable unmarked stocks. Using Vander Meulen's system of chainspace measurement—which was developed spe- cifically for identifying paper without watermarks—and the evidence of distribu- tion, I distinguished four distinct pairs of unwatermarked papers, all appearing in Lear, H5 , or both. Correctly pairing twins in unmarked papers can present a greater challenge than pairing their watermarked cousins. In marked papers the default probability is that two marks of similar design that appear either in runs or in the same gathering or gatherings of multiple copies are twins (though there may be the complicating factor of multiple pairs of the same design as discussed above). Unmarked papers lack this obvious visual discriminator, and without the cue of the watermark, it is easy to measure exemplars of the same unmarked paper in opposite directions, producing chainspace models that are mirror im- ages of each other. The only expedient is constantly to be alert to this possibil- ity, and to compare individual models backwards and forwards when trying to find matches. When a run of a single unwatermarked stock appears in a series of gatherings, pairing the twins is perfectly straightforward. But this was not the situation I found in Lear and H5 , though eventually the pairings became clear. Unmarked stock 0.1 was the most prevalent, and, in the copies examined, the only one of the unmarked papers to appear in both quartos: in gatherings C, D, E, and G of H5 and I and L of Lear . Stock 0.2 ("a" twin only), appears in Lear gatherings C and E; stock 0.3 exclusively in Lear gathering G; and stock 0.4 in H5 gatherings E, F, and G. Only in gatherings E and G of H5 does more than one of the unmarked stocks appear, so that while proper pairings were a bit murky at first, distribution and average chainspace evidence brought eventual clarity: 0.1 average 21.25 and 21.32; 0.2 average 23.85; 0.3 average 21.73 and 21.61; 0.4 average 24.23 and 24.31. Again as predicted by Needham, I discovered a substantial number of water- marks not encountered by Greg, several of which had been previously identified by Stevenson. Needham's description of these marks as "fugitives" is particularly apt, since, of the twenty new marks I rounded up, a dozen were loners repre- sented by only a single individual. The fugitive kind is by nature elusive, and fittingly enough, half of them were rousted from their hideout in the Oldcastle , the last of the Pavier quartos to be printed. A few of the new-found marks were more gregarious: four examples of No. 29 = B POT: neck w/H; six of No. 33 = B HAND: PA (the only HAND marks encountered); and seven of No. 31 = B POT: MP. And I eventually found both twins for seven of the new marks. There are a few fugacious unwatermarked papers as well. These are the loneliest of the lon- ers. I cannot posit a separate stock for each individual since without additional distribution evidence there is no way of determining which might be twins. Paper stocks, prolific as they already are, should not be unnecessarily multiplied. By far the most interesting of the fugitive watermarks are Stevenson's "Shake- spearian Dated Watermarks" (see note 9). It was impossible not to feel a certain frisson on first looking into Huntington's Oldcastle and H5 and recognizing the FIGURE 5. Stevenson's watermark drawings from "Shakespearian Dated Watermarks," p. 161. little pots that Stevenson had scrutinized on that long-ago July morning. It was, however, a distinctly chill and rainy March day when playing at bowls was not an option. And it is with no little sadness that I report Stevenson's supposition that these marks are dated to have been erroneous. For ease of comparison, I have reproduced Stevenson's drawings (figure 5) as well as my own (figures 6 and 7), which I believe to be slightly more accurate (my drawing of the H5 mark [figure 7], from the felt side, is the reverse of Stevenson's.) I am fairly certain that the mark- ings in the neck of the Oldcastle POT are not in fact a date. It is unclear that there is in fact an initial digit 1 distinct from the line that forms the side of the pot's top. What Stevenson saw as a 6 is not at all clearly so, and could be more plausibly seen as an 8 or an X; the design may well have originally been XOX. And it seems highly unlikely that even had Jaggard swept out his stockroom he would have found a sheet of paper that had lain about for a decade. The arguments against the H5 example being dated are fairly definitive. The last figure, if indeed it is a figure, is a 9 not a 7. And Stevenson somewhat exag- gerates the dot between the putative 6 and 9, which he believed to the stub of a 1 that has broken off; it appears more likely to be a small sewing dot. Stevenson's argument became even more tenuous once I had discovered the twin of this mark in gathering E of the Victoria and Albert copy of H5 . Here the figure that Stevenson supposed to be a 9 is actually reversed and there is insufficient space for a 1 in the middle of the design, though it would in any case be singular (pun intended) if the same digit had coincidentally broken off in both twins. Any doubt was dispelled by the discovery of one of the twins from a second set of moulds bearing a similar design (figure 8). Again there are only three figures, which are NOTE. Though it is the only one of the twins encountered, I call this the "b" twin because it is centered in the left of the sheet as viewed from the felt side. The likelihood is that if I found its fugitive twin it would be a mark centered on the right. The same is the case with the mark illustrated in figure 8. FIGURE 6. Watermark 46; B POT:MD? b . FIGURE 7. Watermark 43.1; B POT: PD w/spike top.1. FIGURE 8. Watermark 43.1; B POT: PD w/spike top.2. probably lines and curlicues rather than numerals. There are no Shakespearian dated watermarks in the Pavier quartos. IV As the sequence tables of watermarks by gatherings in the plays illustrate (ap- pendix 1, below), the paper stocks of the Pavier quartos present a baffling array of different situations and combinations. 39 39. The appendixes present the paper data in several forms. Appendix 1 offers "sequence tables" for each of the plays and is organized by copy and gathering so that both the sequence of papers for any given copy and the variety of papers that appear in a given gathering of copies examined can be readily seen. Appendix 2 summarizes play-by-play the data from the sequence tables to show the total exemplars of each watermark that appear in a given copy and the total occurrences of that mark in all examined copies for each play. Finally, appendix 3, a summary table of watermarks in all plays, is organized by watermark and play so that the presence and distribution of all watermarks observed in the Pavier quartos can be seen at a glance. The Whole Contention is printed on an entirely homogenous stock; Pericles and The Yorkshire Tragedy are both on a similar and slightly mixed stock of five papers (each has one mark that doesn't appear in the other); The Merchant of Venice is printed on a moderate mix of ten papers; and the four remaining titles exhibit miscellaneous mixtures of between fifteen and eighteen papers. Similarly, there is considerable variation in individual gatherings. A few, including Per gathering T, MND gathering H, MWW gathering E, and SJO gathering K are, in the copies I have examined, printed on a single paper; a few other gatherings— Per X and Z and YT C, for example—are nearly as homog- enous, with a second paper appearing in only in one or two copies. At the other end of the spectrum I have found nine different papers in MWW gathering C and eight in H5 gathering E. As can be seen in the summary table of watermarks in all plays (appendix 3), individual papers also vary considerably in their frequency. The most frequently occurring is No. 23, since every gathering of each of the twenty-three copies of The Whole Contention I have examined appears on this paper, and the same stock also appears in the first few gatherings of Pericles. The most ubiquitous paper, however, is No. 2, which appears in six of the eight quartos, in a total of 26 gatherings. No.1\14 appears in five quartos (17 gatherings), No. 6.1 in five quartos (12 gatherings), and No. 5 in four quartos (10 gatherings). On the other hand I found only a single example of each of a dozen fugitive papers. While the distribution of the various paper stocks both within and between titles is not straightforward, several patterns emerge that suggest a complex pro- duction system that utilized cast-off copy and the concurrent printing of multiple plays to keep Jaggard's two presses busy. Peter Blayney has demonstrated through headline analysis a pattern of very regular alternation in the use of skeleton formes for the printing of the Pavier quartos. With few exceptions, sheets are printed and perfected using the same skeleton, and "alternate sheets use alternate skeletons." 40 40. Peter W. M. Blayney, "'Compositor B' and the Pavier Quartos," The Library 5th ser. 27.3 (Sept. 1972): 181–206; esp. pp. 197–198. The only major exception is Sir John Oldcastle , which uses a single skeleton throughout. This pattern of alternation is, to an extent, recapitulated in the pa- per stocks. After The Whole Contention, printed exclusively on No. 23, the printing of Pericles begins with a new stock, No. 2, eked out with a bit of leftover 23. At gatherings X and Y of Per two new stocks emerge, Nos. 7.1 and 6.1 respectively. But then gathering Z goes back to stock 2 and sheet 2A is predominantly on 1\14. The pattern of alternation also includes The Yorkshire Tragedy , whose print- ing had probably begun about the time Per had reached sheet Y or Z, with that same general mix of papers appearing in YT as in the last four sheets of Per . 41 41. Blayney had noted that "It is possible that the shorter YT might have been printed concurrently with PER or during an interruption …" (p. 196). The pattern continues with Merchant of Venice , whose paper stocks in the first few gatherings alternate with those at the end of YT . The following table compares the stocks for the last four gatherings of Per with the four gatherings of YT and the first four of MV . The predominant mark is listed first and should be given most weight in comparisons. Per X Y Z 2A 7.1, 23 6.1, 23 2, 1\14 1\14, 2, 23, 6.1 YT A B C tp/D 1\14, 2, 23, 6.1 1\14, 2 2, 1\14 6.1, 2, 23 MV A B C D 2, 1\14, 7.1 6.1, 2, 15\16.2 7.1, 1\14 6.1, 1\14 The suggestion is that each of the two presses had a particular stock of paper laid out, with the printing and perfecting of sheets from Per alternating (though not nec- essarily regularly) with the beginning of YT, then the end of YT with the beginning of MV, with movement back and forth between presses as the formes became ready. In the wake of Greg's revelations about the Pavier quartos, W. J. Neidig in 1910 undertook a minute examination of their title pages, eight of which bore the "Heb ddieu" printer's device. He determined that the device and the attribution "Written by W. Shakespeare" had been left standing for most of the production of the Pavier quartos, with the titles and publisher/date line being changed around them as needed. By carefully tracking the series of changes, Neidig was able to propose the order of their printing: The Whole Contention, Pericles, The Yorkshire Trag- edy, The Merchant of Venice, The Merry Wives of Windsor, King Lear, Henry the Fifth, Sir John Oldcastle. He contended that A Midsummer Night's Dream, which has a different device on its title page, was printed separately from the rest of the series. 42 42. "The Shakespeare Quartos of 1619," Modern Philology 8 (1910): 145–163. Neidig further argued that the order of printing for the first three titles was: "Whole Contention (text and title page), Pericles (text only), Yorkshire Tragedy (text only), Yorkshire Tragedy (title page), Pericles (title page)." 43 43. Neidig, "Shakespeare Quartos," p. 156, n.1. The paper evidence shows that this could not have been the case. The source of Neidig's error was the assumption that the title pages of Per and YT were printed separately from the texts of the plays, but in both cases the paper evidence makes clear that the title pages were printed with their final gathering: 2B of YT and D of Per. Surprisingly, the paper distribution shows that the final gathering of Per was actually printed first, indicating that the copy had been quite accurately cast off, a relatively straightforward task when working from printed copy (though neither is a page-for-page, line-for-line reprint of its setting copy: Per Q3, 1611; YT Q1, 1608). The Per gathering 2B appears on the same mix of Nos. 2 and 23 as the first two gatherings of the text, R and S, and this mix occurs nowhere else in the Pavier quartos. It strains credulity to imagine that Jaggard held back a stack of this precise mixture until the end of the play so that its watermarks would match those at the beginning of the text. It is also possible that the final gathering of YT was also printed first, following Per gathering Y, which appears on the same and newly introduced mark 6.1. Since YT is by far the shortest of the Pavier quartos, at only three and a half text sheets, such a procedure would have guaranteed that the "Heb ddieu" device would be ready in plenty of time for setting the title page of MV, the next play to be printed. Whatever the precise order of sheets through the press, the evidence for concurrent printing of these three plays is strong. Neidig placed the printing of MWW after MV because its title page uses the line "Written by W. Shakespeare." with the "Heb ddieu" device and because three other titles using that specific attribution had already been printed. 44 44. There is no doubt that this particular combination of attribution and device had been left standing during the printing of Per, YT, MV, and MWW. I printed off Neidig's photographs of these four pages and, using the "poor-person's collator," superimposed the pages in every pos- sible combination while holding them up to the sunlight. The setting in each case is the same. I am inclined to agree, though evidence of the paper stocks offers nothing definitive. Gathering A of MWW is printed mostly on No. 3, the only gathering in which it predominates, 45 45. There are a few scattered sightings of this mark in C and D of MWW and A of MND. though one copy has No. 8 and another No. 6.1, the marks found in the final gathering of MV. So there is at least a tenuous link between the end of MV and the beginning of MWW. If the order MV &gt; MWW is correct, however, there is small anomaly. MV is the first of the Pavier quartos to bear a false date, and it seem peculiar that, having decided that subterfuge was necessary, Pavier and Jaggard would have reverted to the actual date of 1619 for MWW before then falsely dating the four remaining titles. It is at least possible that the first gather- ing or two of MWW had been printed off before work began on MV, which was completed before work resumed on MWW. The suggestion has at least tenuous support since gathering B of MWW and gathering A of MV share a similar mixed stock of predominant 2 with an small admixture of 1\14, though MV also has a bit of 7.1 not present in MWW. The printing of MND has proved the most difficult to place in the sequence because it alone among the post- Contention plays does not use the "Heb ddieu" device on its title page. Neidig thus assumed that for some reason it was printed independently. Peter Blayney, however, has provisionally suggested that, on the basis of Greg's distribution charts, MND was most likely to have been printed be- tween MWW and Lear. 46 46. Blayney, "'Compositor B,'" p. 197. My own fuller sample essentially corroborates Blayney, though I believe it more likely that MWW and MND were printed concurrently. MND may actually have been begun either slightly before or simultaneously with MWW, since its first gathering is printed predominantly on No. 6.1, the primary stock for the penultimate gathering of MV. This would explain the use of a second publisher's device for the MWW title page, since the "Heb ddieu" would have been unavailable. Though the stocks for both MMW and MND are quite miscel- laneous both between and within gatherings, the central gatherings of both plays share several similarities. The related pairs 24\27.1 and 24\27.2 appear only in MWW gatherings C, D, and F and MND gatherings C and F, 47 47. The sole exception is sheet C of the Newberry copy of Lear, which has one of the 24\27.1 pair. and No. 5 appears in several gatherings of both, notably in MWW gathering E and MND gathering D, which are both printed exclusively (or nearly so) on this paper. The order of the final three titles is essentially uncomplicated, though there are again some anomalies. It is for example somewhat curious that Lear, the next play in the sequence, has its first two gatherings printed on the mixture of Nos. 2 and 1\14, which had appeared as early as Per gathering V, then in YT gatherings A, B, C, MV gathering A, and MWW gathering B. While the reappearance of a particular mix later in the overall printing sequence may be a random occur- rence, it is at possible that the first few gatherings of Lear were set and printed off shortly after MWW gathering B, as soon as the "Heb ddieu" device became available, and that MWW and MND were then finished off before work resumed on Lear. This procedure would further explain the use of a second device for the MND title page. Such a complex matrix in which three titles were simulta- neously in production would not seem an impossible strain on an experienced printing house, and may have been a useful expedient in maintaining a balance between composition and presswork. The succeeding play, Henry 5, was begun while Lear was still in press, probably between the printing of gatherings F and H of the latter. It is possible to designate the moment rather precisely since the first gathering of H5 is printed exclusively on stocks 12\19.1 and 12\19.2, the precise and exclusive mix of Lear H and F, and this particular stock is found nowhere else in the Pavier quartos. H5 and Lear are also the only plays with significant unmarked stocks: they share 0.1; Lear also exhibits 0.2 and 0.3 and H5 has a bit of O.4. 48 48. There are single examples of fugitive unmarked papers in MWW sheet G and MND sheet B. Sir John Oldcastle was the last of the Pavier quartos to be printed, largely on the related stocks 15\16.1 and 15\16.2. One curiosity of the SJO stocks, as noted above, is the substantial admixture of fugitive papers in otherwise largely homogenous stocks. Ten new papers appear in its ten gatherings, most of them in only one or two exemplars. It does seem possible that, arriving at the end of this substantial project, Jaggard tidied up his warehouse by throwing in whatever odd bits were lying about. But perhaps most curious is that, having done so, the final gathering of the Pavier quartos is printed exclusively on stock No. 5, a paper that appears in several previous gatherings and had not appeared unmixed since MWW gathering E. It is worth noting that the final gathering of MND also ap- pears on an unmixed stock, No. 2, and the final gathering of MV is nearly so. While I have not undertaken a comprehensive survey of the paper stocks that passed through Jaggard's printing house in and around 1619, a few observations may be made to contextualize the production of the Pavier quartos. Two titles in particular seem to have been printed at much the same time as these quartos. The anonymous Troubles in Bohemia, and diuers other Kingdomes. Procured by the diuel- lish practises of state-medling Iesuites (1619; STC 3213) is a six-gathering quarto that is printed mostly on stock 23, with one sheet of #2, the same mix that is found in the first few gatherings of Per. This indicates that the matrix of concurrent printing that clearly took place with the Pavier quartos may have encompassed non-related titles as well. Similarly, The second part of the booke of Christian exercise, appertaining vnto resolution (1619; STC 19388), a 12 o , has eighteen of its twenty-one gatherings printed on stock #5, a paper that appears largely or wholly unmixed in MWW E, MND D, and SJO K. The likelihood, then, is that this twelemo was printed sometime in the mid-to-late stages of the Pavier quarto project. A third possible and intriguing connection with the Pavier quarto paper stocks might be made to John Selden's The Historie of Tithes, which saw four editions reach print in 1618, if their title pages are to be believed (STC 22172, STC 22172.3, STC 22172.5, STC 22172.7). I quote, with some omissions, David Gants's account of the difficulties surrounding the publication of this controversial work: This book was originally produced in [William] Stansby's house, but sometime during Christmas 1617 the Bishop of London raided the establishment, confiscated the paper and type being used to print it, and shut down the business for a time…. When the work appeared the next year (with a long preface refuting the objections raised by others and some modifications to the text itself), the only identifying features on the title page were its author and the publication date. The printer even went so far as to explicitly distance himself from the text with a short "Printer to the Reader" coda…. Stansby's unfortunate experience, along with the fear that further trouble might attend this book, apparently prompted the printer of these volumes to stay as far away as possible from this debate…. There is also reason to believe that at least one of the four editions was printed after 1618, although confirmation of this supposition awaits further investigation. 49 49. David L. Gants, "A Quantitative Analysis of the London Book Trade 1614–1618," Studies in Bibliography 55 (2002): 195, n. e. If it was not Stansby who, defying the authorities, printed these editions of The Historie of Tithes, might it have been William Jaggard? In the Folger copy 1 of the first of these editions I found four of the Pavier quarto papers—numbers 4.3, 5, 1O\11, and 26, with the mixture of 4.3, 10\11, and 26 occurring in a substan- tial run from gathering D to 2T (with an occasional admixture of other stocks). Overall, thirty-six of its sixty-seven folio gatherings were printed on Pavier quarto papers. Of course the same paper stocks can and do appear in the products of more than one printer; but the conjunction of four identical stocks is at least suggestive. The detective who wants to pursue this further investigation, should, as W. W. Greg did a century ago, follow the paper trail, armed (as Greg was not) with a clear, flexible, plastic ruler with a millimeter scale. APPENDIXES 1.

Greg had queried his identifications of gathering 2A in the C 2 (Capell) and O (Malone) copies, the former as mark 1, the latter as mark 14; chainlines show that both were actually Greg's 1. (See above for his understandable confusion over this pair.) Greg was unable to identify the mark in 2B of the C 2 (Capell), O (Malone), and Y 2 (Huth) copies. Since 2B was printed as a half-sheet with the title-page, approximately one-half of the copies show no watermark in this leaf. (Greg must have realized this since he did not identify 2B in these copies as unwatermarked.) Chainlines allow positive identification in all but one case, F(12). The F(10) copy was apparently made up, since different papers appear in the title-page and 2B. Table 1.3.

Greg had been unable to identify the mark in C 2 (Capell) gathering D and had queried, though correctly identified, the mark in L(1) (Garrick) gathering D. Table 1.4.

Collates A-K 4 . Greg must have erred in recording the marks for gatherings A and B of the L(1) (Garrick) copy, both of which he identifies as mark 1; the rest of the marks for this copy match perfectly my own observation. Greg had also queried his identifications for gatherings E and K of this copy; both are correct. For gathering B of the O (Malone) and Y 2 (Huth) copy Greg failed to recognize that there was a second pair of ARMS: RG marks, identifying them instead as his mark 18, which unlike the two 15\16 pairs is centered be- tween rather than on chainlines.

Gathering C has examples of all four pairs of Greg's single mark 4, and gathering D has three of the four. The unmarked paper in F(5) gathering G is another of the fugitives, the only example I encountered. Table 1.6.

Collates A-H 4 . I have included the Huth copy examined by Greg in its usual position fourth in the list, but designated it H instead of Y 2 and reported Greg's assessment of it. All other Y 2 (Elizabethan Club) copies appear to be the Huth copies, but the Y 2 MND does not match Greg's sequence, nor does any other copy I have examined. The paper at O gathering B is one of five fugitive unmarked papers which I have met with only once. Table 1.7.

In the O (Malone) copy Greg had questioned his identification of his mark 20 in gathering B; he was correct, though he didn't know that there were two sets of mark 20. He offered only a query for O gathering E. It is one of the fugitive unmarked pa- pers, as is that in copy E gathering G: I have found no other examples of either. Table 1.9.

Collates A-K 4 . Greg identified gathering G in the Huth copy as mark 21, which looks to me like a cap with a TV antennae on top; if Y 2 is indeed the Huth copy, this is an error since the mark is my 31, a POT surmounted with a pyramid of martini olives. I have found Greg 21 in no copy of Oldcastle. My identification of N(2) gathering I as mark 37 is tentative since I have only fragmentary drawings of this mark and its possible twin in the same gather- ing of L(2). 2.

MARY ASTELL'S WORK TOWARD A NEW EDITION OF A SERIOUS PROPOSAL TO THE LADIES, PART II by E. Derek Taylor Mary Astell (1666–1731) is probably best known today as the author of the ubiquitously anthologized Some Reflections Upon Marriage (1700), a cunning diatribe against the hypocritical marriage practices of early-eighteenth-century England that well deserves its current reputation as one of the foundational texts of Western feminism. Reflections was also popular in its day, reaching a fourth edi- tion in England in 1730 when William Parker, who had taken over the stock of Astell's longtime bookseller Richard Wilkin, agreed "to republish her most popu- lar books" (Perry 315). Specifically, along with Reflections, Parker issued a "new" third edition of The Christian Religion, As Profess'd by a Daughter of the Church of Eng- land (first edition 1705; second edition 1717), the pinnacle of Astell's sophisticated philosophical and theological thought, while in the same year Edmund Parker (no evident relationship to William) released a third edition of Astell's correspon- dence with Neoplatonist John Norris of Bemerton (1656–1711), Letters Concerning the Love of God (first edition 1695; second edition 1705). 1 1. The "third" edition of Christian Religion does not appear to contain any authorial revi- sions of the second edition. The second edition, however, is substantively different from the first edition; see below, note 15. The popularity of Astell's first published work, A Serious Proposal to the Ladies (1694), had burned brightly, if swiftly, as well; it reached its fourth and final edition in 1701, coupled with the one significant work penned by Astell that never saw a subsequent edition, A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, Part II (1697). Given the alacrity with which Wilkin combined the two works—they first were published together in 1697, the same year that Part II had earlier been issued seriatim —it would appear that Part II simply did not sell well, and that the remainders of the original sheets made their way into the combined editions of 1697 and 1701. This would explain why, even in the combined edition of 1701, which contains the fourth and final revision of Part I, the title page to Part II is unchanged—and why Patricia Springborg found no discrepancies between this 1701 issue of Part II and the original printing of 1697 in her modern edition of Parts I and II. 2 2. Springborg does refer in her "Note on the Text" to "significant amendments" evident in the 1701 fourth edition of Part I (viii). Perhaps Astell had misjudged her audience. In Part I (hereafter abbreviated SPI ) she had outlined in inspired terms her "serious proposal" to construct ex- clusively female religious academies wherein women could advance their minds and spirits secluded from a male-dominated culture that encouraged them, she charged, to remain addle-brained and pretty. Although her detractors won the day by smearing the plan as closet Catholicism, Astell's argument, an admixture of wide-eyed idealism and urgent practicality, caught on with a reading public comprising ever more women, and would continue for decades to appeal to a broad range of thinkers interested in the problems of (in particular) young women, among them, to name a significant few, Daniel Defoe and Samuel Richardson. 3 3. "Defoe," as Perry, 100, writes, "seized upon its central idea for a section on 'An Acad- emy for Women' in his Essay Upon Projects (1697)." Richardson's "good man," Sir Charles Gran- dison, similarly expounds a scheme for " Protestant Nunneries " (in The History of Sir Charles Grandison [1753–54]), which, properly ordered, would prove "a blessing to the kingdom" (2: 355–356). Part II (hereafter abbreviated SPII ), written largely in response to the failure of SPI to elicit requisite financial backing, attempted to provide in print what Astell had been unable to secure in bricks and mortar. Ruth Perry has aptly charac- terized SPII as "a training manual for Norris's brand of Christian Platonism," a "kind of 'how-to-do-it' manual to be used at home" by women interested in self-education (83). Its erudite distillation of the philosophical principles of Des- cartes and those who had variously taken up his mande (Antoine Arnauld, Pierre Malebranche, Norris, and, in small measure, John Locke) is probably more true to Astell's general tendencies as a thinker and writer than SPI —Norris, it should be noted, was at first shocked to learn that his incisive interlocutor in Letters was a woman, while Francis Atterbury, bishop of Rochester, admitted to a friend, "I dread to engage her" 4 4. See Norris's initial response to Astell in Mary Astell and John Norris: Letters Concerning the lave of God (71–75). Perry reprints Atterbury's letter to George Smalridge in her biography of Astell (219). —but it was evidently unappealing to readers who had been charmed with the romantic patina of Astell's initial proposal. 5 5. Astraea Hill, Aaron Hill's daughter and an early reader of Samuel Richardson's novel- istic masterpiece Clarissa, or the History of a Hung Lady (1747–48) in manuscript and published form, saw clearly how Astell's plan would have contributed to Clarissa's relief, as evidenced in her letter to Richardson of 13 December 1748: "How fast, if England had such Sanctuary Retreats as Protestant Nunneries, wou'd a Clarissa's State contribute to the filling of 'em!—I am sure, for my own part, cou'd I have found myself in such a Situation as Hers was when she left her Father's House (and Sister Minny bids me add for her part, too) I shou'd have made such haste to take a place there, as to wave all Right to a probation year, for seasoning Novices into a sense of their own undisturb'd Felicity. For certainly no vow cou'd be a rash one, that but help'd a woman to throw off, to Distance unsurmountable, the Lovelace's, and Mowbray's and Belton's, and Tourville's, and Solmes's, and sad Harlow's [sic]!" (Forster Collection, XIII, f. 139). Many women were likely enamored more with the idea of a safe-haven than with Astell's decid- edly ambitious conception of a proper curriculum. However much her audience may have resisted SPII, Astell, it turns out, did not abandon it. Her work toward a second edition exists in the pastedowns, free endpapers, and margins of her personal copy, now housed in the Northampton Records Office, UK. I discovered this copy of Astell's work by what might best be characterized as an informed accident. At the time, I was investigating connections between non-juror and Boehmean mystic William Law, novelist Samuel Richardson, and Astell and Norris. I knew from A. Keith Walker's book ( William Law, 1973) that Law had once owned, as part of his public library in King's Cliffe, several of Norris's works, including his and Astell's Letters, and I tracked the remainders of FIGURE 1. Astell's notes on the operating costs of Sutton's Hospital, on the recto of the final rear free endpaper of her copy of A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, Part II. this library to the Northampton Records Office. From its catalogue of the Law- Library Collection, I learned that several books contained inscriptions indicating that they had once belonged to Astell herself. 6 6. A copy of William Cave's Antiquitates Christiana (1675), for example, contains the hand- written inscription, "Mary Astell, her Book, given her by her uncle, Ralph Astell, pretium Xs"; another of Cave's works, Apostolici (1677), contains a similar inscription: "Mary Astell her book, 1677." The reference to Mary's uncle Ralph lends credence to George Ballard's report in Memoirs of Several Ladies of Great Britain (1752) that "an uncle who was a clergyman," having early recognized his niece's "great propensity to learning," elected to "be her preceptor" (382). In her biography of Astell, Perry correctly identifies this refreshingly enlightened uncle as Ralph Astell (53, 74). Perry's excellent biography of Astell enabled me to clear up this puzzling discovery; Elizabeth Hutcheson, who along with Hester Gibbon joined Law in a life of religious meditation and service in King's Cliffe in 1744, was Astell's close friend and executrix of her will (519, note 27). Hutcheson, it seems clear, donated to Law's charitable library those books Astell had left behind. The copy of SPII I found in this collection contains no such inscription, however, and so I began with the hypothesis that the substantial handwritten annotations and textual corrections throughout the book pointed to Law, who, according to Walker, frequently marked his texts. Perhaps he had considered reintroducing the world to Astell's neglected treatise? Having found an example of Law's handwriting, 7 7. Reproductions may be found in Stephen Hobhouse, Selected Mystical Writings (1949). however, I was forced to discard this hypothesis and to pursue what I considered an unlikely, if tantalizing, possibility—namely, that the additions had been penned (and penciled) by Astell herself. This possibility was confirmed by Professor Perry when she explained in an email that looking over the reproductions I had sent was like "bumping into an old friend after many years." (A sample of Astell's handwriting in this volume appears in figure 1.) In the remainder of this essay, I seek to accomplish three fundamental tasks: (1) to provide a general account of Astell's notes, comments, and emendations to her text; (2) to propose a likely timeframe for her additions and revisions; and, (3) to offer some tentative suggestions regarding both Astell's purposes in revising her text and the logic informing the changes she elected to make. I conclude by suggesting ways that this text might qualify, even change, our understanding of Astell, her development as a writer, and the nature of her social commitments as a public—and female—intellectual. What? Astell used both pen and pencil to make various additions, deletions, and substitutions within the text of her copy of SPII; she also added significant pa- ratextual comments and notes to the front and rear endpapers and pastedowns. Many of the in-text changes follow a general pattern of revision evident in, for instance, the single-word changes between the first and second editions of Let- ters Concerning the Love of God (1695; 1705). Stylistically, Astell almost invariably revised "downwards," substituting less rarified words for her sometimes esoteric, or archaic, terminology. Thus, in letter 3 of Letters, Astell replaced "recondite" with "hidden," and "Benevolence" with "Good-will." In letter 5, "meliorating" becomes "improvement," while "sapid" becomes "relishing." In letter 7, "de- faulting" and "peccant" are replaced by "taking" and "sinful," while in letter 9 "Diagnostick" is changed to "Mark." 8 8. See Letters, pp. 79, 80, 87, 91, 100, 100, 112. For a full recording of such emendations, see Letters, Appendix One (167–183). This same tendency is apparent in Astell's revisions of SPII; "lost its haut goust " becomes "lost its relish," "than a Bon-mien " is changed to "than a good mien," "Nutrition" becomes "Nourishment," "Acu- men" becomes "Sharpness," and "fill up my Vacuities" is replaced by "supply my Wants." 9 9. See below, Appendix 1, entries for 12.12 (75.9), 12.14 (75.1O), 24.14 (81.9fb), 24.2fb (81.4fb), and 29.8–9 (83.17). These and all further references to Astell's in-text emendations have been keyed by page and line number first to Astell's copy of the 1697 edition, then, in parentheses, to Springborg's modern edition (Pickering and Chatto, 1997). The abbreviation "fb" stands for "from the bottom of the page." In all of her major works, Astell was necessarily attempting to strike a delicate balance between accessibility and erudition; her changes thus reflect, at least in part, a conscious attempt to narrow the distance between herself and those less- educated women she hoped to reach. As she explains in the preface to Letters, Astell was "far … from coveting the Fame of being singular" as an "ingenious Woman"; she had a true rationalist's faith that any woman, "by employing her Faculties the right way"—i.e., by receiving a proper education—could achieve a high level of intellectual acuity (66). On the other hand, Astell was a gifted thinker, and, in a sense, her own best witness. The smarter her writing, the more convincing her argument that women's minds differed from men's in application, not substance. In short, Astell needed to impress without putting off—a particu- larly difficult line to negotiate given the vast discrepancy between the most and least educated members of her intended audience, and one that became even more pronounced with the onset of satires on Astell's "singularity" as a thinker in the first decade of the eighteenth century. 10 10. Susanna Centlivre in The Basset Table (1705) and either Richard Steele or Jonathan Swift in two numbers of The Tatler (1709; nos. 32 and 63) each satirized Astell through the cre- ation of an otherworldly, unnaturally intellectual, and otherwise weird character named "Ma- donella." See Perry, III and 228–230. Donald F. Bond, it should be noted, thinks it unlikely that Swift is the author of either number; see the notes on "Authorship" in his 1987 edition of The Tatler, vol. 1, pp. 236 and 434. All of Astell's in-text notes and emendations have been recorded in Appendix 1. It is certain that she made many of these changes after 1714, when the three- volume The Ladies Library appeared in print. Volume one of this work contains an extensive selection stolen, with some editorial changes, from chapter three of SPII; Astell interlaces with pen and pencil many, but not all, of these unsolicited editorial changes into her text and margins. It is conceivable that a few in-text changes may have been made as the first issue was still being printed in 1697. For instance, Astell's printed text reads "we grope in the dark"; Astell has crossed out "grope" in ink and inserted in the margin "stumble." While the copy of SPII in the British Library also has the original "grope," Patricia Springborg's copy text in the Folger Library has "stumble," indicating that stop-press changes must have been made along the way. 11 11. See Appendix 1, entry for 47.4–5 (91.13). It is possible, then, that Astell made this change in 1697 for the original compositors to follow; but it is also possible, and I think more likely, that this an- notation and others like it reflect a later attempt on Astell's part to bring the text into accord with the final state of the first printing. This would explain why Astell made in-text corrections to errors already included in the list of errata. 12 12. See Appendix 1, entries for 22.8 fb (78.36) and 31.12 (84.8). Surrounding the text are various but, I believe, related additions. I have transcribed these in a series of appendices, as follows: Appendix 2. Front pastedown—references to The Ladies Library; biography of Fénelon; ref- erence to "changes." Appendix 3. First front free endpaper, recto and verso—note on English statutes relating to the "erection of hospitals," etc. Appendix 4. Penultimate rear free endpaper, recto—quotation from a sermon by George Hickes. Appendix 5. Final rear free endpaper, recto and verso—accounts for "Sutton's Hospital." Throughout, I have recorded Astell's comments as faithfully as possible. Illegible words or phrases have been denoted as such in brackets, except where a plausible guess could be made, in which case any uncertain word is preceded by an itali- cized question mark. I have provided a brief introduction to each appendix. When? The vast majority of Astell's various handwritten comments, notes, and emendations must have been added sometime during the final 16 years of her life, i.e., sometime between 1715 and 1731. The first two references on the front pastedown—to The Ladies Library (1714) and to the deceased Fénelon (d. January 1715)—do not, of course, definitively date the entirety of Astell's various inser- tions and changes to her text (indeed, as noted above, there are a few possible in-text exceptions to this time-frame). But inasmuch as the interrelated nature of the additions suggest a rhetorical strategy on Astell's part—a point I hope to establish in the course of this introductory essay—a reasonably focused period of composition may safely be supposed. Astell began and ceased her editorial work on SPII, I think, for a variety of related reasons that may be traced to a five-year period, beginning after 1715 and ending around 1720. It was during these years that Astell became centrally involved in securing the future of the Chelsea school for girls she had founded in 1709—"Astell's project from idea to execution," Perry explains (233). The school, which provided a rudi- mentary education for "daughters of Chelsea Hospital veterans" (239), fits neatly into a broad social pattern of benevolent engagement that spread throughout the long eighteenth century, comprising figures from across the political and religious spectrum. It is fully appropriate that Astell's copy of SPII would find a permanent home in the King's Cliffe Library, where, to quote from the inscription above the lintel, "Books of Piety are … lent to any Persons of this or ye Neighbouring Towns." 13 13. Quoted in Walker, 170. The library building is still standing, its inscription still vis- ible. The contents of the library, as noted above, have been transferred to the Northampton Records Office. The library was only one of host of charitable projects conducted in the 1750s by William Law, Elizabeth Hutcheson, and Hester Gibbon—including tenement houses for elderly widows and, fittingly enough, schools for poor boys and girls. If, in her choice of eleemosynary project, Astell was very much a woman of her age—M. G. Jones claims of Astell's contemporaries, "the charity school was their favorite form of benevolence" (3)—she was also, of course, quite literally pursuing her own longstanding interest in promoting female education. It is true that the Chelsea school differed in important ways from the unabashedly religious academy Astell had envisioned in SPI, wherein women of family would have re- tired, for various reasons and perhaps only for a while, into a veritable utopia of female companionship and Christian rationalism; "no rhapsodies there," Perry quips of the Chelsea school, "about Christian love and the need to bend one's thought always to God" (239). Nevertheless, Astell's school did address the most pressing concern she had underscored in SPI: the lack of an established venue for female education. That these were poor girls instead of women of means, that the school's curriculum consisted of practicing reading and writing rather than meditating on Arnauld and Malebranche, that religious instruction dwindled from rapturous to perfunctory–these were differences in degree to Astell, not in kind (though, undoubtedly, the differences are pronounced). The Chelsea school was the fruit, however bruised, however long in ripening, of the quite serious proposal Astell had offered to the reading public over a decade before in her first published work. It is both fitting and telling that Astell's final original composition, Bart'lemy Fair: Or, An Enquiry after Wit (1709), appeared in the same year that the Chel- sea school began operating—an indicator, as Perry has suggested, not only of her waning popularity as a writer, but of a decided shift in her social commit- ments. 14 14. "Her last two works had not sold well," Perry notes, and "it would have been unseemly to remain in public controversy" while soliciting support for her school—which, at any rate, "entirely occupied [Astell's] attention in its early years" (231, 233). However, despite her work on behalf of the Chelsea school during this period—and despite the onset of a nagging cataract in 1710 (Perry 231)—Astell nevertheless found time, if not to compose new proposals, reflections, or enqui- ries, then to revise considerably at least one of her previously published works: Wilkin published the second edition of her Christian Religion in 1717, a substantial revision of the original edition of 1705. 15 15. Astell substantially revised the conclusion to her work, for instance, cutting several sentences and adding an "Appendix" comprising passages formerly spread throughout the first-edition text. She also added marginal headings clarifying the particular arguments of individual sections. Might Astell have caught the revision bug at this period? Having turned the corrected pages of Christian Religion over to her bookseller, perhaps Astell's momentum carried her to one final text need- ful of editorial attention, one perfectly suited to carry her then current project more fully into the public eye. She may already have "overstayed her welcome in the world of letters," as Perry suggests (231), but Astell would seem to have discovered good reason to linger a litde while longer. At its opening, the Chelsea school was housed "in borrowed rooms on the premises of the Royal Hospital" (Perry 240); there it remained and operated for 153 years. A borrowed school, however, is not a school of one's own. "[F]rom at least 1719," Perry explains, "Astell actively campaigned … for the land and construction costs to build a separate establishment" (240). It was to this end, I believe, that Astell made the various notes, addenda, and corrections in her copy of SPII, a new edition of which, had it been published, might have stoked public interest in her capital campaign on behalf of the Chelsea school. The failure of her campaign, as Perry notes, may be adequately explained "by the stock market crash of 1720" (240); then, as now, charitable organizations suf- fered tremendously in times of economic stress. This fact alone might have been enough to kill the new edition on which Astell was at work, but it was not alone. In the same year that the South Sea Bubble burst, thereby siphoning away the financial resources Astell's proposed schoolhouse desperately needed, Richard Wilkin died, leaving Astell without the bookseller on whom she had depended throughout her 25-year publishing career. The gradual petering out of emen- dations to Astell's text—as shown below in Appendix 1, she made only a few changes in the final 50 pages—may very well reflect the suffocating weight of this confluence of discouraging events. Why? It must be remembered that by the time Astell came to make the vast ma- jority (quite possibly all) of the changes to and comments in her copy of SPII, it had long ceased to exist as a text separate from SPI. In the final two of its three issues (1697 and 1701), SPII had been bound with corrected new editions of SPI; though a title page announced the work in "two parts," the separate title page to SPII never changed from the initial printing of 1697. In other words, as Astell pondered her revision, she likely would have been thinking of A Serious Proposal to the Ladies Parts I and II, not of the second part alone, even though the text in which she recorded her changes and additions was not itself bound with SPI. This fact may explain the nature of the paratextual additions Astell wrote on the opening and closing blank leaves of her book, many of which would ap- pear to be more directly related to the primary argument of SPI —i.e., the need for the education of women through the establishment of academies—than to that of SPII, which adduces a plan for self education. French theologian François Fénelon, for example—a figure of evident interest to Astell during the period in question 16 16. In a letter of 1-8-1720 (?) [Perry's question mark] Astell writes to Lady Ann Coventry, "I have bin reading y e late A. Bp. of Cambrays Letters, w cḥ make me very sick of my own" (repr. in Perry 389). Perry assumes that Astell is reading the Paris edition of 1718, and thus must have "mastered" French at this point (389, note), but it should be noted that an English translation of Fénelon's letters appeared in 1719: Private Thoughts Upon Religion, In Several Letters. Written to His Royal Highness the Duke Regent of France. By the Archbishop of Cambray (London). —mattered to Astell because the education of girls had mattered to him; it is not coincidence that the brief biography of him she added to the front pastedown (see Appendix 2) opens with a reference to his Traité de l'education des filles (1687), wherein the influential French theologian had argued that custom, not nature, dictated against the academic instruction of girls, and that educating children, rather than just boys, would have salubrious, not destructive, social re- sults. The long passage Astell recorded on the recto of the penultimate rear free endpaper from a 1684 sermon by Fénelon's English translator, George Hickes, likewise underscores the importance of implementing a societal plan for female education—i.e., of actually "building schools" (see Appendix 4). 17 17. Hickes was one of a number of non-juring High Churchmen interested in the "cause" of "women's education," as Perry puts it (119). In fact, Perry notes, he "recommended Astell's books in the 1707 edition of his translation of Fénelon's Traité de l'education des filles, " in particular SPI and II and Christian Religion (119, 498, note 60). Hickes's was the sort of plan Astell herself would later propose in SPI, of course, perhaps with- out thinking fully of the legal and logistical hurdles such an establishment would need to clear. Now, however, she seems prepared to mount not only a moral, but a legal justification for constructing female schools. On the recto and verso of the first front free endpaper, Astell has transcribed from Sir Edward Coke's The Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England (1641) the operative portions of two English statutes (39. Eliz. Cap. 5. and 21. Jac. Cap. 1) that clear the way for private citizens to build and incorporate charitable "hospitals" or "houses of God" (see Appendix 3). By establishing this legal footing, Astell effectively aligns her proposal with a demonstrably English and Protestant tradition of privately sponsored charity, thereby justifying her campaign for establishing a separate Chelsea school facility. 18 18. It is worth remembering the primary rhetorical function of SPI —to solicit charitable contributions toward Astell's cause. Hence, in her peroration, Astell pointedly wonders, "Is Charity so dead in the world that none will contribute to the saving their own and their neigh- bours Souls?" (44–45). The Charterhouse school, also known as Sutton's Hos- pital after its founder, Thomas Sutton (1532–1611), must have struck Astell as exemplary of the sort of charitably funded institution she was hoping to found; she has included an account of its operating costs on the recto and verso of the final rear free endpaper (see Appendix 5 and figure 1). For all of the practical ramifications a new edition would have entailed, how- ever, Astell's motives were not purely benevolent. In pointing to Elizabethan and Jacobean statutes legitimizing her proposal for female academies, for instance, Astell belatedly answers the primary charge laid at her door by those who had attacked SPI when it was first published some 20 years before—namely, that it amounted to de facto Catholicism. (Astell, it should be noted, would never have used the phrase "protestant nunnery" to characterize her proposed institutions. 19 19. Ballard explained that Astell's scheme had found significant support from "a certain great lady" ready to "give ten thousand pounds"; Bishop Gilbert Burnet "powerfully remon- strated against it" to the unnamed woman (perhaps, Perry suggests, Princess Anne [134]), explaining that "it would look like preparing a way for popish orders [and] would be reputed a nunnery, etc.," thereby effectively eviscerating the project (Ballard 383). In the course of her sustained critique ofjohn Norris in Discourse of the Love of God (1696), John Locke's supporter and friend Damaris, Lady Masham, also attacked Astell's proposal. Astell responded in her Christian Religion complaining, "what they seem most affraid of, is dispeopling the World and driving Folks into Monasterys [Astell marginally cites Masham's Discourse, 120], tho' I see none among us for them to run into were they ever so much inclin'd; but have heard it generally complain'd of by very good Protestants, that Monasteries were Abolish'd instead of being Reform'd: And tho' none that I know of plead for Monasteries, strictly so call'd, in England, or for any thing else but a reasonable provision for the Education of one half of Mankind, and for a safe retreat so long and no longer than our Circumstances make it requisite." See p. 235 of her "Appendix" to the second edition of Christian Religion (1717), included as Appendix Three in my and Melvyn New's modem edition of Astell and Norris's Letters (221 –258). John Locke (d. 1704), another of Astell's early opponents, also resurfaces in the annotations within the text of SPII itself—though, it is important to note, her references to him here are at worst ambiguous, at best respectful, and thus work against Springborg's insistent reading of SPII as unrepentantly anti-Lockean in intent. 20 20. Of the two references, one may be read either as an attack on Locke or, more likely, as a note of indebtedness; the other is almost certainly an acknowledgment of debt (see Appendix 1, entry for 49.2fb–50.2 (92.13–14) and note; and entry for 133.10–14 (122.19–21) and note. As I have argued elsewhere ("Astell's Ironic Assault"), Astell almost certainly composed SPII before she had identified Locke as someone of any particular concern to her either personally or intellectually; hence, her only direct textual reference to him in SPII —139 of Springborg's edition—is both utterly tangential and blithely commendatory. Those behind The Ladies Library , first published in 1714, 21 21. The Ladies Library actually appeared in (at least) two editions in 1714; see below, intro- duction to Appendix 1. Unless otherwise noted, all references are to the earlier version. were similarly in Astell's sights, albeit in a decidedly complex fashion. A compilation of uncredited excerpts from a host of writers, Astell among them, The Ladies Library claims on its title page to have been "Written by a Lady" but "Published by Mr. Steele"; Sir Richard Steele also provided the dedication and the preface to the first volume. Astell held him responsible for the plagiarism—as she had for satiric attacks on her in The Tatler —and his Whiggism would only further have inspired her invari- ably Tory-leaning pen. (The actual author of The Ladies Library, George Berkeley, was only definitively revealed in 1980 by Stephen Parks. 22 22. See Parks, "George Berkeley." Parks includes a transcription of the 1713 agreement between Berkeley, Steele, and Jacob Tonson (2). As Richard Dammers notes, "the paternity of The Ladies Library was quickly attached to Steele"; as early as 1714 publisher Royston Meredith "accused Steele of using [Jeremy Taylor's Holy Living and Holy Dying] without paying for it" (530). ) It is clear from the front pastedown (Appendix 2) that Astell was looking for grounds on which to confront Steele. The Ladies Library, she here correctly points out, "recom. Poetry p. 22. &amp; discomends it p. 25.V.1."—precisely the sort of obvious logical contra- diction on which Astell liked to seize when on the attack. 23 23. On p. 22 of Vol. 1, The Ladies Library calls on women to "despise those Arts which have no Complacency for the Deficiencies of their Education, and take Pleasure and Profit in such as freely lay open all their Stores to them, as do History, Poetry, and Eloquence." Yet, on p. 25, it warns of "the Danger of reading soft and wanton Writings, which warm and corrupt the Imagination," noting that "too much of this will be found among the Works of Poetry and Eloquence, with which none but Ladies of good Taste and solid Judgment should be trusted." And in pointing to "p361–365 V.2," Astell may be expanding the charge of thievery beyond SPII , to a more subtle borrowing of her arguments in Reflections Upon Marriage . 24 24. In recommending that widows remain unmarried, The Ladies Library adduces a number of decidedly "Astellian" arguments—e.g., "[I]t seems not very prudent to relinquish both Lib- erty and Property, to espouse at the best a Subjection, but perhaps a Slavery "; and, "[W]herefore 'tis their Concern well to Ballast their Minds, and to provide that their Passion never get the Ascendant over their Reason" (2: 361, 365). Astell does not register any awareness of Berkeley's other definite "borrowing" from her works; Volume 1, pp. 438—447 excerpts SPI (13–17). Yet, on the other hand, Astell appears either to accept or, at least, to consider accepting a number of Berkeley's revisions to the excerpt he lifted from SPII. She does not record every variant as she would have done, one assumes, were she simply keeping track. 25 25. On p. 113 of Springborg's edition, for instance, Astell writes, "And in order to the restraining it we may consider …"; vol. 1 of The Ladies Library reads, "That we may the bet- ter restrain it, let us consider …" (474). Similarly, on p. 130 of Springborg's edition, Astell writes "rest and terminate," while Berkeley has only "terminate" (500). It is worth noting that in both instances, Astell does record two other specific changes made by Berkeley on the page in question, so it is clear that she did not somehow skip these pages; see Appendix 1, entries for 107.7fb (113.15) and 155.14–15 (130.13). Instead, she seems to weigh his changes, both minor and major, at times even revising his revision. 26 26. See, for instance, Appendix 1, entry for 138.7fb–6fb (124.15–16) and note. With respect to the changes to Astell's text, Dammers characterizes the "editor" of The Ladies Library as one "careful" to make "appropriate changes." Berkeley's revisions, Dammers believes, are "generally designed to moderate an enthusiastic tone, to delete sentences referring to an earlier section of A Serious Proposal , to improve awkward wording, or to summarize an entire section into a few words" (533). True, several of Astell's attempts to comport her text with Berkeley's break down syntactically, the inchoateness of the "revised" text suggesting a level of uncertainty, or perhaps haste, on her part. And, to be sure, Astell's pointed reference in her Preface to the second edition of Bart'lemy Fair (1722) to Steele's (as she thought it) piracy suggests, at the very least, skepticism as to the value of the revisions: "[O]ur honest Compilator has made an honourable Amends to the Author, (I know not what he has to the Book-Seller) by transcribing above an hundred Pages in to his Ladies Library, verbatim; except in a few Places, which if the Reader takes the Trouble to compare, perhaps he will not find improv'd" (quoted in Perry 230). Ultimately, then, one can only speculate as to Astell's plans for those of Berke- ley's revisions she incorporated into her text. Given the fact that these changes exist alongside other revisions unrelated to Berkeley's pilfering, and that Astell tinkered with his changes even as she recorded them, I tend to think that she would indeed have followed some of Berkeley's unsolicited editorial advice in a new edition of SPII —probably with a requisite, and perfectly Astellian, satiric jab at the original theft. One can easily imagine Astell "thanking" Steele in a new preface for his editorial assistance, and noting that in acknowledging his minor changes, she is doing more than he felt compelled to do when he copied an en- tire chapter of her book. After all, she might have noted, unlike herself, Steele had benefited from a free education at a respected institution—having been ac- cepted by the respected Charterhouse school in 1684 as a gownboy, essentially a scholar-in-residence. Surely, the product of Thomas Sutton's charitable bounty, the evidence for which Astell had dutifully recorded down to the penny (see Ap- pendix 5), would join her in soliciting charitable donations toward the Chelsea school for girls. So subtle a response, however, would obviously have been pre- cluded when Astell was forced to abandon her plans for a second edition in 1720, which might explain her scoffing dismissal of the revisions two years later in Bart'lemy Fair . How does this text affect our understanding of Astell? On the one hand, it most assuredly does not clear up any sensational mysteries for which our post- Possession sentiments hunger—Astell has scribbled in her book neither an an- nouncement of sexual passion for another woman, nor the name of the "eminent clergyman" (rendered, one fantasizes, in a clever but discernible anagram) to whom George Ballard claims she had been affianced at a young age (385, note). Nevertheless, it does work to flesh out, if only in small measure, the biogra- phy of a woman who has discovered herself to us only, if at all, as in a glass, darkly. (Even Ballard, writing in 1752, was forced to rely primarily on hearsay in his brief account of her life.) Who knew, for instance, that Astell had read works by René Rapin (Appendix 1, 89.10–16), yet another in a growing list of Cartesian Catholics peopling her list of intellectual influences? Or the degree to which she herself recognized, or came to recognize, the precedents in Fé- nelon and Hickes for her arguments on behalf of women? And if we have come to recognize Astell's derision for Locke and Steele, her equivocal treatment of them in her copy of SPII will perhaps give us pause, for it may reveal a more complex reaction on Astell's part to these erstwhile adversaries than heretofore assumed. But more than anything else, Astell's book reveals a clue as to how its author's mind was working at a critical point in her history—as well as a lesson in the tenuous nature of book production at this time. If the dating I have proposed in this essay is more or less correct, then the degree to which Astell relied on her bookseller Richard Wilkin may have been even more pronounced than previ- ously recognized. I do not pretend to know with certainty how Astell would have used the material she recorded in her copy of SPII in a new edition. Perhaps, taking as a model the substantial "Preface" Astell added to the third edition of Some Reflections Upon Marriage (1706), her comments would have served as fodder for a new introduction to her undeniably dated, but not outmoded, work. The Chelsea school, I have suggested, must have struck Astell as the logical exten- sion of her original hobby horse; and, however much one may be reminded of Parson Adams's myopic faith in the value of his volumes of sermons in Henry Fielding's Joseph Andrews (1742), she still believed—or wished to believe—in the ability of her earliest works to communicate her sense of urgency on this score. Indeed, in this respect, the piracy of The Ladies Library may very well have inspired Astell to contemplate a new edition by showing her that the world continued to be interested in the subject. Although Astell's work toward a new edition of SPII did not make it into print, she never abandoned the project that had in large measure stimulated her revisions. Even as death, in the form of breast cancer, approached in 1730, she was still actively seeking donations "towards building a charity school for the teaching and instructing of the children of poor soldiers belonging to Chelsea Hospital." 27 27. See Astell's letter of 9 September 1730 to her patron and friend Lady Betty Hastings acknowledging receipt of £50, a full 1/4 of her total commitment to the project (repr. in Perry 399). APPENDIX 1 Text of A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, Part II 1 1. I am extremely grateful to Jacqui Minchinton for her careful and thorough recording of Astell's in-text emendations and comments. Introduction Astell made use of a variety of markings and methods for correcting or com- menting upon her own text. Emendations are sometimes interlined within the text itself, but more often are found in the margins and linked to particular points in the text with corresponding asterisks. I have recorded as faithfully as possible in the Original column all emendations, including Astell's abbreviations, using a modified version of the system of bracketed transcription and editorial explana- tion proposed by David L. Vander Meulen and G. Thomas Tanselle: In our system, square brackets surround editorial record and comments; braces are used for the next level of parenthesis when commentary is required for alterations within altera- tions. The editorial statements are italicized and thereby differentiated from words quoted from the document, which consequently do not need quotations marks…. Generally the basic element in each editorial comment is a participle, such as canceled or inserted . (205) Vander Meulen and Tanselle suggest emphasizing either the original or the re- vised reading by consistently including within brackets either deleted or added words; I have modified slightly their system by reporting within brackets all af- fected words, i.e., both the original and the revised text. Astell's changes are then standardized in an admittedly speculative New Edition ? column in order to provide a clean text of her revisions. Thus, where the opening entry in the Original column reads "and Inconsiderate had [taken up inserted in left margin for canceled imbib'd] to," the same phrase in the New Edition ? column reads "and Inconsiderate had taken up to." Astell's marginal references to particular texts or authors likewise have been recorded within brackets in the O RIGINAL column following the italicized phrase marginal note inserted . Astell made her changes and marginal comments primarily in pencil, but sometimes in pen, and with no discernable pattern; in the emendation of 17.6 (76.2-1 fb), for instance, she crossed out two words, one in pencil, the other in pen. All changes made in pen are recorded as such; where confusion might arise, pencil markings are also explicitly noted. Editorial silence thus indicates that the markings are in pencil. The majority of the changes here transcribed stem from Astell's engagement with Berkeley's revised plagiarism of the third chapter of SPII , which comprises the bulk of his chapter on "IGNORANCE" in the first volume of The Ladies Li- brary (1714), pp. 438-524 (Berkeley's appropriation of Astell covers pp. 447-524). Her documentation of Berkeley's work is consistently three pages discrepant from the copy I first consulted, "printed for J. T . and Sold by W. Mears … and J. Brown ," according to the title page. As it turns out, The Ladies Library was pub- lished in two different editions in 1714, the other one, according to its title page, "printed for Jacob Tonson," without further amplification. This form does indeed match the pagination provided in Astell's marginal citations, and it appears to be the earlier of the two versions. Where appropriate, I have drawn attention in my notes to revisions made in the second edition. Berkeley often changed Astell's punctuation, capitalization, and spelling, but I have made note of such variants only where they seem to have been of interest to Astell. Astell frequently cites Berkeley's text by page in the margins; where she does not, I do so in a footnote. In the footnotes I have also tracked significant departures from The Ladies Library and made note of those occasions on which Astell herself seems to lose the thread of her emendatory intentions.

René Rapin (1621-1687), French Jesuit, influential neoclassical critic, and prolific au- thor of theological and philosophical tracts, many of which were translated into English. Astell's passage parallels in both logic and phrasing section 5 of his Some Christian Reflections (1673): "All the wisest among the antient Philosophers have believed they knew nothing: In summe, the uncertainty of the Senses which are such deceivers, the natural obscurities of the Heart of man, the weakness of his Spirit, Education, Custom, Opinion, the tumult of ordinary Passions, and those prepossessions no power can surmount, have so utterly effaced all those footsteps of Truth which remained in man, that the most common Secrets of Nature appear inconceiveable [sic] to the most wise and knowing" (203-204). 47.4-5 (91-13)] we [stumble inserted in pen in right margin for canceled in pen grope] 6 6. Astell crossed out the original, "grope," heavily in pen, and added "stumble" in the margin. The British Library copy also has "grope." Springborg's copy-text (held in the Folger Shakespeare Library), however, had "stumble," suggesting a stop-press change. in we stumble in 49.2fb-50.2 (92.13-14)] An Opinion … thing considerable [ marginal note inserted Lock] 7 7. The "new way of ideas" John Locke had presented in An Essay Concerning Human Under- standing (1690) had been attacked most famously by Bishop Stillingfleet, of course, but also by Astell in her Christian Religion (1705). Assuming this pencil note, like the others, was made after 1715, Astell may be pointing to Locke as representative of those thinkers who valued novelty over truth, and/or as one who disables his own truth claims by refusing the Platonic concept of divine ideas. It is also possible, however, that Astell is simply noting her own Lockean dismissal of historical consensus as a necessary arbiter of truth. 68.9fb-7fb (99.1)] The perfection of the Understanding consisting in the Clear- ness [ marginal note inserted in left margin ?

Again, Astell's citation would seem to refer to Rapin's Reflections, wherein he too com- plained that "Philosophers," by "accustoming their Spirits too much to knowledges palpable, sensible, and evident," have rendered themselves "very unfit for the Submissions of Faith." In a paradox Astell would readily have accepted, Rapin argued that in order truly "to be reason- able," a person must recognize the need for "Reason" to "be submitted to Faith."

And this, therefore, as has been said, I call Intuitive Knowledge; which is certain, beyond all Doubt, and needs no Probation, nor can have any; this being the highest of all Humane Certainty. In this consists the Evidence of all those Maxims, which no Body has any Doubt about, but every man (does not, as is said, only assent to, but) knows to be true, as soon as ever they are proposed to his Understanding" (4.17.14.683). Astell would appear to acknowledge her debt to Locke on this point, though she, unlike Locke, held to the Augustinian guarantee for the validity of such self-evident ideas by maintaining that "all Truth is Antient, as being from Eternity in the Divine Ideas" ( SPII 92). 134.1fb-135-1 (123.4-5)] Distinct, ¶ [ open bracket before next word ] That 48 48.

Astell adds the citation to Descartes just where her quotation of him ends (at "he ought"); this correction is indicated in the list of errata—it calls for the citation to be placed at the beginning of the quotation, not the end—and Springborg adds it to her edition ac- cordingly (though without the close quotation mark—an oversight). In the British Library copy of Astell's work, the correction has been made to the text and is included in the list of errata—another indication of stop-press changes. Compare this discrepancy with 47.4-5 (91.13), where Springborg's text shows the correction but neither the British Library copy nor Astell's copy does the same. It would appear that corrected and uncorrected sheets were mixed in no discernable pattern as copies of SPII were being compiled, a process which Melvyn New and I encountered in our work with the first edition of Astell and John Norris's Letters Concerning the Love of God (1695); see Letters, "A Note on the Text" (50-52). 136.9-137.1 (123.17-8fb)] not.

Astell's intentions here are difficult to decipher. She has inserted a "Q," in the margin before the first word of this passage ("We"), and she fails to close the bracket she opens around "its true," a canceled phrase in Berkeley. Ladies Library reads as follows: "'Tis true, we all pre- tend to this, and think our selves injur'd if it be not believ'd; we are disinterested…." We all pretend to this, and think our selves Injur'd if it be not believed; we are Disinterss'd 168.17-18 (135.3-4)] of Education, Capacity, [ye inserted in pen for canceled of] Leisure, and [ye interlined in pencil ] Opportunity 71 71.

It is possible that this represents a very early change that Astell had hoped to include in the list of errata—but it should be noted that this change, unlike other potentially early changes, is made in pencil; cf. the entry for 47.4-5(91.13) and note 6. APPENDIX 2 Front Pastedown Introduction Astell makes several direct references to The Ladies Library (1714) at the top of the page. Though many of her words are smudged beyond recognition, the still legible points of reference suggest that she was fishing for ammunition to use against it and its author. In the middle of the page, Astell has penned a brief biography of François Fénelon, including the date of his death, a significant fact when considering the possible dating of Astell's additions to her text. Astell often uses asterisks to mark her in-text emendations; this would appear to be the purport of the phrase "allowing all changes" which follows the asterisk here. At the bottom of the page is the shelfmark (3 D 17) used by William Law's library in King's Cliffe. Text Ladys Library recom. Poetry p. 22. &amp; discomends it p. 25. V.1.

Many of her phrases come directly from Coke's legal commentary; see 720-725, especially 722-723. The legal parameters here delineated clearly shaped Astell's plan for the Chel- sea school. She is careful in her letter of 4 Sept. 1730 to Lady Betty Hastings to distinguish between the £ 200 her aristocratic supporter had pledged "towards building a charity school" and the " £ 200 more" she planned to raise "by benefac- tions towards the use of the building " (reprinted in Perry 399; emphasis mine)—i.e., the maximum initial endowment allowed without procuring a license of Mortmain, essentially a tax paid to the monarch for the right to incorporate. Blackstone's dis- cussion of this point in Commentaries (1765-69) is illuminating: "THE parliament, we observed, by it's absolute and transcendent authority, may perform this, or any other act whatsoever: and actually did perform it to a great extent, by statute 39 Eliz. c. 5. which incorporated all hospitals and houses of correction founded by charitable persons, without farther trouble: and the same has been done in other cases of charitable foundations. But otherwise it is not usual thus to intrench upon the prerogative of the crown, and the king may prevent it when he pleases. And, in the particular instance before-mentioned, it was done, as sir Edward Coke observes, to avoid the charges of incorporation and licences of mortmain in small benefactions; which in his days were grown so great, that it discouraged many men to undertake these pious and charitable works" (1.18.462). Governmental concern that too much privately held land was passing into charitable corporations—and thereby rendered inalienable—led to the passing in 1736 of statute 9 George II c.36, the so-called "Statute of Mortmain," which strictly limited the ability of own- ers to make charitable dispositions of their properties. For an excellent account of the imprecision with which concepts of charity and mortmain historically have been conflated, see Chantel Stebbings, "Charity Land: A Mortmain Confusion," The Journal of Legal History 12.1 (1991): 7-19.

APPENDIX 4 Penultimate Rear Free Endpaper, Recto Introduction Astell excerpts a sizable passage from a sermon by non-juror George Hickes ( A Sermon Preached at the Church of St. Bridget [1684]). Hickes takes Hebrews 13.16 as his starting point: "But to do good, and to communicate, forget not; for with such Sacrifices God is well-pleased." Astell knew Hickes and so could have come at his sermon in any number of ways. Her pagination reveals her source to be a copy of the sermon as published individually in 1684 (the quoted material does indeed fall on pp. 26-27), but it is worth noting the appearance in 1713 of A Collection of Sermons, Formerly Preached by the Reverend George Hickes, D. D., 2 vols. Text I wou'd also put you in mind of establishing a Fund for endowing of poor Maids, who have liv'd so many years in Service, &amp; of building Schools, or Colleges for y e Education of Young Women, much like unto those in y e Universitys, for y e Educations of Young Men, but not w th out some alteration in y e Discipline and Oeconomy, as y e nature of such an Institution wou'd require. Such Colleges might be so order'd, as to become security to y E Daughters against all y e hazards to which they are expos'd at private schools, &amp; likewise a Security to y e Gov- ernment, y t Daughters of y e Land shou'd be bred up according to y e Religion now establish'd in it, to y e unconceivable advantage of y e Public, in rooting out Enthusiasm with her Daughter Schism .

Dr. Hicks in his [ word illegible ] Sermon, Apr. 1 1684. P 26, 27. APPENDIX 5 Final Rear Free Endpaper, Recto and Verso Introduction Astell records a financial record (see figure 1) for Sutton's Hospital, also known as King James's Hospital, but better known then (and generally known now) as the Charterhouse, a charitable institution created and supported by a bequest in the will of Thomas Sutton (1532-1611). The "Brothers" to whom the record refers speak to the Hospital's mission as a pensioners' home for elderly men, many of them sailors who, to borrow a phrase from Gerald Davies, "had served England well in the hours of her need and were now left high and dry to beg their bread in their old age" (223). The references to "Scholars" underscore its other function as a school for promising boys of upstanding, but financially limited, families. Not only Richard Steele, but Joseph Addison, John Wesley, and, in the nineteenth century, William Thackeray would benefit from Sutton's gift. The similarity between Sutton's dual-purpose foundation and Astell's Chel- sea school for girls, itself an outgrowth of the Royal Hospital for elderly veterans, would not have been lost on her. Along with 80 brothers, Sutton's will made pro- visions for 40 scholars; Astell's Chelsea school, according to Perry, "was meant to handle thirty poor girls" (238). Astell's source for this account is almost certainly Samuel Herne's Domus Car- thusiana (1677), which, on 145-153, transcribes in pounds, shillings, and pence the Establishment for the Dyets, Liveries, Stipends, Wages, and other Charges and Expences […] at the humble Petition, and only costs and charges of Thomas Sutton, Esquire […] . Astell's handwriting here is particularly inscrutable; I devoted an embarrass- ing number of months to discovering "Fuller's Hospital," another contemporary almshouse near London (as it turns out), only to ascertain its utter incompatibility with the numbers Astell recorded. I deciphered many of her other references only by consulting Herne. Astell records many of the specific entries she found in Herne, though she does at times combine several entries into a single category or ignore single entries entirely; she also renders Herne's roman numerals as arabic. Interlaced through several of the entries in smaller print are Astell's attempts to arrive at a "per person" figure, something Herne does only on occasion—a point of dif- ference tracked, along with particularly archaic references, in the endnotes (ren- dered as arabic to avoid, as much as possible, confusion). The money system in Astell's day and for nearly three centuries beyond, it should be noted, consisted of 12 pennies to the shilling, 20 shillings to the pound. Text Suttons Hospital £ s d 8 At y e Masters Table weekly for Bread, 10 1 1. At 10 shillings per person, the total does indeed come to 4 pounds. 4. 0. 0 Beer, Diet, Detriments 2 2.

Herne: "Sixteen Gowns for Sixteen Grooms and other inferior Officers at xx s. a man" (148). 16. 0. 0 431. 0. 0 Wages &amp; Fees 16 16. Astell elides three pages of specific charges included in Herne—from the "Preacher" ( £ 40), to the "Gardner" ( £ 20), to the "Clock keeper" ( £ 2)—and instead provides only the final total. 1066. 6. 0 Ordinary Allowances Masters Fuel 10. 0. 0 Preachers 5. 0. 0 Fuel for y e Hospital 152. 0. 0 Renewing y e Housold stuff 50. 0. 0 Candles 45. 0. 0 Washing etc. in all 17 17. I.e, the total for "Ordinary Allowances." Note that Astell's final total reflects specific categories not included in her list, hence the apparent discrepancy—the Manciple's fuel allow- ance, for instance, was £ 2, while £ 10 was set aside for "Burials." "Washing" is indeed one of the specific charges included in Herne's list. 432. 16. 0 Y e Whole 3706 £ . 9s. 10½ 18 18. Cf.

HENRY FIELDING IN CHINA by Jiaming Han Although there were some translations of Western literary works into Chinese in the late nineteenth century, large scale translations started in the early twentieth century, and Henry Fielding was one of the first English novelists introduced to the Chinese reader. From the earliest translation of his works in the 1920s through the official commemoration of the two-hundredth anniversary of his death in 1954 to the numerous translations of Tom Jones in the reform period late in the century, the reception of Fielding serves as a good representation of the response to English literature in modern China. This ar- ticle attempts to survey the translations of Fielding's works into Chinese and to discuss some notable studies by Chinese scholars. At the same time, the article will indicate significant features of the development of the publishing industry in twentieth-century China. Before any translation of Fielding's work appeared in China, Chinese intel- lectuals got to know a bit about him from an article on the classic Chinese novel A Dream of Red Mansions (also known as The Story of the Stone ). In 1920, Wu Mi, who first attended the University of Virginia in the fall of 1917 and later gradu- ated from Harvard with an M.A. degree in comparative literature, published an article entitled "A New View on A Dream of Red Mansions ," in which he examines the Chinese novel according to the six characteristics of a great novel specified by G. H. Maynadier in his "Introduction to Tom Jones ." These six characteristics are: serious purpose, large scope, firm plot, plenty of action, reality of scenes, and liveliness of characters. 1 1. Hong-lou-meng Xin Tan" (A New View on A Dream of Red Mansions ), Minxin Weekly 1, no. 17 (March 27, 1920) and no. 18 (April 3, 1920). Rpt. in Articles in Comparative Literature Studies 1919–1949 , ed. The Institute of Comparative Literature of Peking University (Beijing: Peking University Press, 1982). Cf. Maynadier's "Introduction" in vol. 2 of the six-volume set Works of Henry Fielding (Philadelphia: John D. Morris &amp; Company, 1902), xxv. In the present article, the names of the Chinese translators and critics are given in the Chinese way with family name first. Wu's article ends with paying tribute to Fielding, especially noting the variety of his characterization in Tom Jones. This is the first time that a Chinese scholar refers to Fielding in a critical essay. When Wu Mi returned to China in 1921, he first taught English literature at the Southeastern University and later taught at Tsinghua University, where he played a crucial role in the founding of the Foreign Language and Literature Department. In the 1930s Wu Mi offered a course entitled "Literature and Life," in which he made frequent references to Tom Jones and Joseph Andrews , and a number of Wu's students later became well-known scholars in the study of English literature in China. 2 2. Wu Mi, Literature and Life (course synopsis), trans. Wang Minyuan (Beijing: Tsinghua University Press, 1993): 25–58. Among Wu's students were Yang Jiang, Yang Zhouhan, Li Fun- ing, and Ying Ruocheng, whose respective contributions will be noted later in the article. The first translation of Fielding's works into Chinese was A Journey from This World to the Next done by Lin Shu with the help of Chen Jialin. Lin Shu was a classical scholar and novelist who knew no foreign language, but in the early twentieth century he translated about 180 literary works in collaboration with scholars who did know other languages. 3 3. Xie Tianzhen and Zha Mingjian, eds., A History of Translated Literature in Modern China (1898–1949) (Shanghai: Shanghai Foreign Language Education Press, 2004), note that among the 180 works, 163 were novels by 98 writers from 11 countries (p. 56). In the "Textual Introduc- tion" to Miscellanies by Henry Fielding, Esq; Volume Two , Hugh Amory refers to this translation as attesting the "continuing vitality of Fielding's work" ( The Wesleyan Edition of the Works of Henry Fielding: Miscellanies, Volume Two , ed. Bertrand A. Goldgar and Hugh Amory [Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1993], 225). The translation of A Journey from This World to the Next was published in 1921 by the Commercial Press in Shanghai. In 1926 Wu Guangjian's translation of Jonathan Wild was published, and two years later came his translation of Joseph Andrews . 4 4. A History of Translated Literature in Modern China states that Wu Guangjian was the first to use vernacular Chinese in literary translation and published about 130 translations. Accord- ing to the editors, Wu Guangjian also translated Tom Jones (pp. 63 and 226). The only known publication of such a translation is the edition (46 pages side by side with the original) that was published by Jin-xiu Press in Hong Kong in 1959. Thus, the 1920s alone witnessed the publication of three works by Henry Fielding, all by the leading Commercial Press. Though Wu's translation of Joseph Andrews was an abridged version, it introduced Fielding's "comic epic in prose" to the Chinese reader. Both of Wu's translations were reissued in 1933. In 1937 a new translation of A Journey from This World to the Next by Yin Xiong was published by Datong Books in Shanghai. This new translation was done probably for two reasons: Lin Shu's translation was in classic Chinese, which was not easy to understand for the general reader, and Lin's translation was rather free, making various omissions and additions based on his own discretion. By the late 1930s, vernacular Chinese had become the accepted literary language and fidelity in literary translation had become the accepted criterion. Yin's new translation reflected these developments, and A Journey from This World to the Next became the only Fielding book with two Chinese translations before the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. Another notable point is that all these transla- tions were published in Shanghai, the center of international culture and of the publishing industry in China at that time. The year 1954 was the two-hundredth anniversary of Fielding's death. The Soviet Union celebrated Fielding as a radical Enlightenment writer and even issued a commemorative stamp in honor of him. China, at the time greatly in- fluenced by the Soviet Union, also organized high-profile activities to mark this occasion. An official meeting held in Beijing and attended by dignitaries and prominent authors glorified Fielding as a great realistic writer. A translation of Book III of Tom Jones by Pan Jiaxun was published in the literary journal Ren- min Wen-xue ( People's Literature ), with an article by Xiao Qian discussing Fielding's achievements. 5 5. Tom Jones , Book III, trans. Pan Jiaxun, Ren-min Wen-xue ( People's Literature ) 6 (1954): 97–110. Xiao Qian, "Reading Fielding," Ren-min Wen-xue 6 (1954): III–118. The journal Yi-wen ( Translated Literature ) published Book IV of Jonathan Wild , translated by Xiao Qian and corrected by Pan Jiaxun. 6 6. Jonathan Wild, the Great , Book IV, trans. Xiao Qian, Yi-wen ( Translated Literature ) 10 (1954): 145–214. Pan Ji- axun and Xiao Qian usually did not work together, and the fact that they were involved in the translation and publication of both novels suggests that they did the translations as official tasks. 7 7. As Xiao Qian used the 1952 Everyman's Library edition for his translation of Jona- than Wild , we may assume that he probably started his translation sometime in 1954 and first translated Book IV in order to meet the publication deadline in the journal, whereas the whole translation was finished sometime in 1955 and published in 1956. Also as a part of the 1954 commemoration, Wu Guangjian's translation of Joseph Andrews was published in a new edition by The Writers' Press in Beijing. 8 8. This translation was later published by Zhong-liu Press in Hong Kong in 1957 and by Taiwan Commercial Press in Taipei in 1966, making it the only Fielding translation that was published both before and after 1949 and in Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, and Taipei. The following years saw numerous translations of Fielding's works. A new and complete translation of Joseph Andrews was done by Wang Zhongnian and published by Pingming Press in Shanghai in 1955. Comparing Wang's and Wu's translations, one can easily see that Wu Guangjian omitted about one-third of the original. Also in 1955, a translation of Jonathan Wild by Jing Xing and Wan Zi was published in Shanghai, and one year later Xiao Qian's translation of Jonathan Wild was published in Beijing. In 1958 Yang Zhouhan published his translation of Fielding's "Preface" to Joseph Andrews and five introductory chapters from Tom Jones under the title "On the Theory of Realistic Writing" in Wen-xue Li-lun Yi-cong ( Translations in Literary Theory ). 9 9. Yang Zhouhan, trans., "On the Theory of Realistic Writing," Wen-xue Li-lun Yi-cong ( Translations in Literary Theory ) 1 (1958): 194–230. Of Fielding's numerous plays, The Coffee- House Politician was translated in 1957 by Ying Ruocheng, a great actor who became a Vice Minister of Culture in the 1980s. It remains the only Fielding play translated into Chinese. The publication of the different translations also indicates that after 1949, Beijing, restored as the capital, soon rose up to compete with Shanghai in the publishing industry. 10 10. Beijing was the capital for several hundred years, but in 1927 the Nationalist Govern- ment made Nanjing the capital. Beijing was restored as the capital in 1949 when the People's Republic was founded. In order to make Beijing also the cultural center, the Commercial Press was moved from Shanghai to Beijing and specialized in publishing works in social science, while the newly established People's Literature Press and The Writers' Press specialized in publish- ing literature. The printing houses still in Shanghai went through a series of reorganizations as can be seen in the publication and reprinting of Fielding's works by presses with different names. In addition to the translations, critical essays on Fielding's works began to appear in scholarly journals. The first was an article by Professor Huang Jiade of Shandong Unversity entitled "Henry Fielding and His Masterpiece Tom Jones " published in December 1954 in Wen-shi-zhe ( Literature, History, Philosophy), the first scholarly journal published by a university in the People's Republic. 11 11. Huang Jiade, "Henry Fielding and His Masterpiece Tom Jones," Wen-shi-zhe [Literature, History, Philosophy) 12 (1954): 8–15. The first part of the article discusses Fielding's writing in general, the second part offers a special analysis of Tom Jones, and the third part reviews Fielding's and Tom Jones 's position in English and world literature. In 1957, Yang Jiang published an article entitled "Fielding's Contributions to the Theory and Practice of the Novel" in the journal Wen-xue yan-jiu ( Studies in Literature ). 12 12. Yang Jiang, "Fielding's Contributions to the Theory and Practice of the Novel," Wen- xue Tan-jiu ( Studies in Literature ) 2 (1957): 107–147. Yang Jiang was a well-known writer, scholar, and translator, and her article is distinguished by its theoreti- cal sophistication, drawing connections from Aristode and Horace to Pinciano and Boileau. But one year later, during the Anti-Rightist Movement, her article was criticized for neglecting the political content of Fielding's works by Yang Yaomin, a graduate student of Yang Jiang's husband, Qian Zhongshu. 13 13. Yang Yaomin, "A Critique on Yang Jiang's 'Fielding's Contributions to the Theory and Practice of the Novel,'" Wen-xue Tan-jiu 4 (1958): 16-23. Cf. Kong Qingmao, A Critical Biography of Yang Jiang (Beijing: Hua-xia Press, 1998), 137–138. In the reform era of the 1980s, however, the same article was singled out for praise by Zhu Hong, another graduate student of the 1950s who was by then an eminent scholar herself. Zhu Hong writes, "While noting Fielding's writings as realistic, Yang Jiang was the first in foreign literature studies in our country to carefully examine Fielding's narrative theory, its specific content, traditional heritage, and new development." 14 14. Zhu Hong, Essays on English and American Literature (Beijing: Sanlian Books, 1984), 309. The fate of Yang's article can be taken as symbol- izing the trend of Chinese politics or the relation between politics and literary studies. There were two other important articles on Fielding published in the 1950s by two Nanjing University professors. One was by Fan Cunzhong, who offered an in-depth study of Amelia. He writes, "Thoroughly exposing the social reality and incisively analyzing the social problems—these, we believe, are the charac- teristics of Amelia and the further development of Fielding's realistic novel writ- ing." 15 15. Fan Cunzhong, "Fielding's Amelia," in Essays on English Literature (1956; Beijing: For- eign Literature Press, 1981), 18–46 (quotation from p. 36). And he goes on to note a clear problem of the novel: "while the story is presented realistically, the ending is too idealistic or utopian." 16 16. Ibid., 37. The other ar- ticle was by Zhang Yuechao, who discussed Tom Jones in his survey of European literary masterpieces. He contends, "Fielding inherits and develops the satiric tradition in European literature and creates superb satiric novels…. Instead of representing human life with absurd visions as Rabelais and Swift did, he de- scribes it realistically; he is a more conscientious realist than Cervantes." 17 17. Zhang Yuechao, "Fielding," in Essays on European Literature (1957; Nanjing: Jiangsu People's Press, 1981), 207–244 (quotation from p. 242). Both articles were later reprinted in collections of critical essays in 1981 in order to provide badly needed studies for students and young scholars after the chaotic ten years of the "Cultural Revolution." Xiao Qian, the translator of Jonathan Wild, was condemned as a Rightist in 1957 because of his critical expressions and was sent to do heavy labor on a farm. But in 1961 he was called back by the People's Literature Press to revise a draft translation of Tom Jones by Li Congbi, a professor of Yunnan University. Later in his life Xiao Qian expressed gratitude to Fielding and Tom Jones for giving him the opportunity to leave the farm earlier. 18 18. Xiao Qian, Feng-yu Ping-sheng: Xiao Qian Kou-shu Zi-zhuan (An Ordinary Life Through Wind and Rain: Oral Autobiography of Xiao Qian ) (Beijing: Peking University Press, 1999), 276–280. This translation was finished about 1966, but by then the so-called "Cultural Revolution" had begun. All foreign literature was considered to be harmful, so the publication of such a novel was out of the question. We might say that it was rather fortunate that the manuscript of the translation was not destroyed. With the ending of the "Cultural Revolution" in 1976, translation and study of foreign literature were restored. But for some years, scholars mainly focused on contemporary works, especially modernist ones. Only gradually were clas- sical works reconsidered. In 1981, Zhang Guruo's translation of the eighteen introductory chapters of Tom Jones was published in the recently founded journal Guo-wai Wen-xue (Foreign Literature), with a critical review essay by Professor Yang Zhouhan, in which he says that we should pay more attention to the classical writers instead of only focusing on contemporary literature. 19 19. Yang Zhouhan, "Fielding on the Novel and Novelists," Guo-wai Wen-xue (Foreign Litera- ture) 2 (1981): 22–26 (quotation from p. 22). About this time scholars were involved in compiling the Chinese Encyclopedia, and Professor Li Funing's article in the Foreign Literature volume published in 1982 is the first lucid and comprehensive introduction of Fielding and his works in China. 20 20. Beijing: Chinese Encyclopedia Press, 1982, 302–303. Also in 1982, Xiao Qian published two critical essays on Fielding: "The Essence of Jonathan Wild!' and "Tom Jones: A Comic Epic in Prose." 21 21. Xiao Qian, "The Essence of Jonathan Wild," Ming-zuo Xin-shang ( Enjoying the Master- pieces) 4 (1982): 14–21, and "Tom Jones: A Comic Epic in Prose," Wai-guo Wen-xue Yan-jiu (Foreign Literature Studies) 5 (1982): 110–113. These es- says were later incorporated into his short monograph Fielding: The Founder of the English Realist Novel, published in 1984 by Shanghai Yiwen Press. This is the first book-length study of Fielding in China. In the same year, the co-translation of Tom Jones by Xiao Qian and Li Congbi, completed about 1966, was finally pub- lished by the People's Literature Press. In the post-"Cultural Revolution" period, Xiao Qian became a very well-known writer and translator, culminating his ca- reer with the publication of a co-translation of Ulysses with his wife in 1994. And because of his prominent status, his translation of Jonathan Wild was published in a new edition by the People's Literature Press in Beijing in 1981, republished by Henan People's Press in Zhengzhou in 1992, and published again five years later by Yilin Press in Nanjing in a new edition with his short monograph on Fielding as an appendix to the novel. It is the translator's reputation that made Jonathan Wild, a novel comparatively neglected by Anglo-American readers and critics alike, the most frequently reprinted and widely read Fielding novel in China, whereas Wang Zhongnian's 1955 translation of Joseph Andrews is becoming an "endangered species." (The two copies in the Peking University Library are no longer in public circulation and can only be read in the rare book room!) In 2005, Tai-bai Literature and Art Press in Xi'an published a ten-volume collection of The Complete Works of Translation by Xiao Qian, which includes his translation of Jonathan Wild and co-translation of Tom Jones. When the Xiao Qian-Li Congbi translation of Tom Jones was published in 1984, Zhang Guruo continued his translation of Tom Jones, which was finally published in 1993, one year before his death in 1994. The translator's Preface was by Zhang's daughter, indicating that he had no energy to write it himself after finishing the translation. Zhang's translation of Tom Jones is faithful to the original not only in content but also in the stylistic features, and it has extensive anno- tations, a characteristic of Zhang's translation ever since he made his name as translator of Thomas Hardy's novels in the 1930s. This translation was awarded second prize for literary translation in the Chinese National Book Award of 1995. In 2001, Yanbian People's Press in Yanji published a two-volume transla- tion of Tom Jones by Xing Jianhua and Hua Dexiang, and the same translation was republished in a three-volume edition by China Drama Press in Beijing one year later. This so-called new translation is basically Zhang Guruo's version with the omission of most annotations. In 2004, Wu Hui's translation of Fielding's last novel Amelia was published by Yilin Press, and in the same year the press also published a new translation of Tom Jones by Huang Qiaosheng, which ap- pears to combine the strong features of the Xiao-Li and Zhang translations. For example, Xiao Qian was against using many notes in translation, while Zhang Guruo was especially known for his extensive annotations, and as a result, the Xiao-Li translation of Tom Jones has 670,000 Chinese characters and the Zhang translation has 990,000, whereas the Huang translation has 770,000: a kind of golden mean between the least and the most annotations. Yilin Press in Nanjing, which has evolved from a magazine founded in 1979 specializing in translations of foreign literature, is now one of the three major publishers (with the People's Literature Press in Beijing and Shanghai Yiwen Press) of translated literature and is carrying out a large project of publishing new translations of all world masterpieces. By now we have five full translations of Tom Jones, three of Jona- than Wild, two of Joseph Andrews, and one of Amelia, plus the two translations of A Journey from This World to the Next published before the founding of the People's Republic, but never reissued afterwards. 22 22. The present article is primarily concerned with the translations of Fielding in Main- land China. However, I would like to take this opportunity to note a complete translation of Tom Jones by Song Biyun published by Yuan-jing Publishing Company in Taipei in 1979 and an abridged translation of the same novel by Zhang Hua published in the same year by Jing- heng Press in Taipei. It is Professor David Vander Meulen's search that called my attention to them. As a sign of the filtering of Fielding's works through scholarly audiences to popular ones, it is worthwhile to note there are two recent condensed editions of Tom Jones for children and teenage readers. 23 23. See Interesting Stories of Tom Jones, condensed by Li Yirong et at. (Shijiazhuang: Hebei Children's Press, 1998) and Tom Jones, condensed by Wen Wen (Beijing: China Children's Press, 2000). The new era not only had new translations of Fielding's works but also saw numerous studies by Chinese scholars; in fact, it is the new translations that have greatly promoted new critical studies. After the studies by Yang Zhouhan, Li Funing, and Xiao Qian in the early ig8os mentioned above, we have had over twenty articles on Fielding and his works. These studies can be classified into three categories: A. General studies on Fielding (9); B. Studies on his individual novels ( TJ 5) JA 2, JW 1); and C. Comparative studies (4). In general stud- ies on Henry Fielding there are articles about his realistic narrative technique, his comic or humorous presentation, his treatment of characters, his panoramic social coverage, and his narrative theory. There are also critics who try to use modern or postmodern theories to examine Fielding's novels. In discussing in- dividual novels, most critics focus on Tom Jones, and only very few pay attention to Joseph Andrews or Jonathan Wild. One explanation for this is that in literary history or selected reading courses most students have learned something about Tom Jones, but rarely about any other Fielding novel. The fact that so many dif- ferent translations of Tom Jones are currently in print attests its great popularity with the critics and the general reader. In the study of Tom Jones, there are articles discussing the issue of morality, the picaresque tradition, the marvelous plot, and social satire, but the nature of Fielding's comic art and the intricacies of his social ideas remain to be further explored. To summarize the discussion in this article, we may note several interesting points. First, the earliest translations of Fielding's works into Chinese were quite random, with omissions and modifications at the translator's will, and this is quite characteristic of the translation of foreign literature at that time. Second, in the 1950s, the translation and study of Fielding's works had official support and were done as a way of supporting the new socialist society by holding up Fielding's works as a critique of early capitalist society. As literature was so closely identified with politics, many scholars' fortunes and misfortunes were bound with the political trend, as the fate of Yang Jiang's article shows. But in the re- form era beginning in the late 1970s translations of Fielding and English or for- eign literature in general tended to be influenced by the market, while academic studies paid more attention to the literary works themselves and to the form of the author's art. Thirdly, this survey indicates the dissemination of the Chinese publishing industry from Shanghai as the center before 1949 through Shanghai and Beijing as the twin centers in the 1950s and 1960s to Shanghai, Beijing, and Nanjing as the three centers in publishing translations of foreign literature in the late twentieth century. At the start of the twenty-first century, almost every major city has a publishing house that tries to have a share of foreign literature translation.

Bonnell * * I am grateful to Michael F. Suarez, S.J., and Terry Belanger for reading earlier drafts of this essay. William St Clair outlined an appealing approach to the study of print culture recently in the Times Literary Supplement. Called "the political economy of reading," it shaped his methodology (and provided the title of his last chap- ter) in The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period (Cambridge, 2004). The basis of this approach—economic data relating to book production and prices, and evidence of readers' access to various texts—is designed to enable historians to "perceive patterns and develop provisional models" on their way to "a fuller and more theoretical understanding of texts, books, reading and consequences." The ultimate objective of a political economy of reading is to understand "why as societies, we have come to think the way we do." 1 1. "But what did we actually read?" Times Literary Supplement, 12 May 2006, p. 15. One attractive feature of this approach is that it embraces the whole spectrum of "the history of the book" as defined by St Clair. At the micro end, he praises a lecture by Robert Darnton in which close textual and contextual analysis of a single pamphlet revealed much about day-to-day experiences in Paris during the French Revolution. At the macro end, he surveys the larger issues addressed by book historians: When and why do books come into existence in the various forms they assume? How are they produced, sold, distributed, and read? What effect do they have on readers, and "on the mentalities of the wider society in which the books were read" ( TLS 13)? Putting his theory into practice, St Clair moves comfortably between the micro and macro levels in his own work. In the TLS he ranges from details of specific publications (formats, print runs, and prices for books by Lord Byron and Sir Walter Scott) to wider observations on readers' "mentalities" in Britain in the early nineteenth century. In The Reading Nation he delivers an enormous amount of data on the book trade, by means of which he reaches broad gener- alizations about literary production and reception. Sharp insights into the book trade abound, as do informative passages about readers and their experiences with books, especially their testimonials of passionate attachment to this or that series of imprints. That literary artifacts serve as objects of both physical and intellectual fascination is fully appreciated by St Clair, whose devotion to this field of study is underscored by dozens of footnotes in which various items (books, advertisements, ephemera, etc.) are attributed to "Ac," the Author's collection. Thirteen densely factual appendices supply evidence to buttress his claims in The Reading Nation. Although he contemplated publishing them separately online, citing the greater "ease with which additions, corrections, and modifications can be incorporated" and the opportunity for electronic searches, he put them in the book so that readers who lacked computer access would not be left out. Still, St Glair conceived of the appendices as "the core of a growing research resource," signaling that he "may decide to put the fuller information online later" (pp. 17–18). In this spirit he envisions a cooperative project for developing a political economy of reading, its first step being to amass the foundational data: "It would be a fairly simple task, with modern technology and many hands contributing, worldwide, to place alongside the plentiful information we already have about texts such scattered information as survives about production, prices, access and readerships, over time" ( TLS 15). This desideratum parallels one aim of his book, which was "to provide the indispensable factual basis which enables the archival and printed record to be interrogated, patterns discerned, and turning points identified, and emerging conclusions offered and tested" (p. 16). This laudable goal is not as simple a task as purported, however, to judge from mistakes that mar St Clair's treatment of "the old canon" in The Reading Nation, his focus in Chapter 7 and Appendix 6. Manifold errors in these sections reveal a range of problems and demonstrate two corollaries to the principle that facts are essential for interrogating historical records and testing conclusions: (1) even seemingly trivial errors shunt one's analysis off course, and turn one away from discerning true patterns or identifying real turning points; and (2) er- rors built into the foundation of an argument may lead to structural fissures or collapse when considerable weight is placed on them. Alerting potentially unwary researchers to these problems is perhaps the more urgent because of the enthusiastic acclaim St Clair's work has received, with more than one commentator marveling at its trove of utterly specific quanti- tative information. But this corrective function of my essay is complemented by a broader one, for the mistakes that crept into The Reading Nation offer an illuminat- ing case study in the importance of bibliographical accuracy. First, by examining St Clair's handling of the collection of poetry famously associated with Samuel Johnson, I will show how readily archival and bibliographical errors ramify into distorted claims about the literary marketplace. Second, I will suggest that a mis- placed trust in outdated bibliographical sources can perpetuate earlier mistakes and stymie our understanding of publishers and readers. Last, I will posit that a fuller knowledge of the bibliographical context casts doubt on several vulnerable arguments about the "old canon." What emerges from this exercise is a word of caution: the archives of publishers, no matter how copious, may prove tricky or even treacherous to the investigator who consults them without solid knowledge of the actual books to which they relate. That bibliographical bedrock is a pre- condition for any research into the history of books and reading. "Johnson's Poets" as Never Known Before In the last third of the eighteenth century, British publishing gave birth to a kind of enterprise that thrives to this day: multi-volume collections of classic English literature, uniformly printed and offered at modest prices to general readers. The earliest, comprising poetry, were produced in Glasgow (1765–76) and Ed- inburgh (1773–76); in London shortly thereafter John Bell published The Poets of Great Britain (1776–82). The opportunity to market such canonical series was facilitated—though not caused—by a watershed copyright case, Donaldson v. Becket , decided by the House of Lords in 1774. St Clair argues that in the decades following this ruling, a group of authors, by virtue of being reprinted over and over again, was "locked in" (p. 130) to form the core of a British literary canon. This "old canon" persisted for one hundred years, through the Romantic era and into Victorian times. There is a germ of truth to this generalization, but it is too sweeping to be of much service, and the more closely one scrutinizes it, the weaker it grows. The most renowned of these publications was The Works of the English Po- ets. Produced to rival Bell's series, it gained instant prominence on account of Johnson's commission to write prefaces for it, afterwards published separately as The Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets. The block of entries dedicated to these titles in Appendix 6 under a dual rubric—"The London book industry's response to the Edinburgh challenge," and the title of the poetry collection (p. 527)—is riddled with mistakes. A footnote keyed to each misstep is the most efficient way to correct them. The figures on the right represent print runs. 1779–81. Originally seventy-five volumes 2 2. It was sixty-eight volumes. St Clair has mistaken the second edition (1790) for the first. 12mo, 3 3. The format was octavo, not duodecimo. then sold as individual titles. 5 5. They were not sold individually. How St Clair derived this idea from "London Catalogue (1799)," the source he cites, is unclear. (See note 19.) A misinterpretation of Strahan's ledgers conceivably contributed to the mistake. (See note 8.) Renamed The Works of the Most Eminent English Poets, 6 6. The collection was not "renamed," which would imply that it was reissued under a new title. The alleged renaming fuses the first part of the title of the collection with the last part of the title of Johnson's Lives. or simply Johnson's Poets. 7 7. Because the proprietors lettered the spines of their bound sets with "Johnson's Poets," the collection has casually been referred to as such. Johnson, indignant over this arrogation of his name, chastised the proprietors for their false advertising. 3,000 4 4. The print run of the 1779–81 edition, as William Strahan's ledgers indicate (BL Add. MS 48815, f. 38), was 1500, not 3,000. It was Johnson's Lives that had a print run of 3,000. (See note 8.) Some volumes, a second edition. 8 8. No such volumes exist. A misreading of Strahan's ledgers causes the confusion. Al- though St Clair cites the archive itself (e.g., pp. 653–655), he also (here and elsewhere, e.g., p. 472) draws on the Ph.D. thesis of Robert Dale Harlan, "William Strahan: Eighteenth Cen- tury London Printer and Publisher" (University of Michigan, i960). Harlan lists what Strahan earned "[f]or printing 3000 copies each of the first and second editions of the third volume of Johnson's Lives and Works of the English Poets " (p. 171). These numbers are accurate (see BL Add. MS 48815, f. 59), but not the title. Harlan tacks the title of the collection onto the first words of the title of Johnson's Lives (in reversal of the fusion mentioned in note 6). St Clair, seeing nothing amiss in this conflation, takes it for the poetry collection, not the biographies. Yet Harlan speaks of the "third volume" alone; St Clair refers to "Some volumes" in the plural. Did he come upon the entries in Strahan's ledgers concerning the complete second edition of The Works of the English Poets , published in 1790, which, like the first edition, was produced by several printers? Andrew Strahan, William's son, printed 1500 copies of "Vols. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30." in September 1788 and "Vol. 47" in December 1789 (f. 112). To an observer unaware of the 1790 edition, such entries might suggest a piecemeal reprinting of the first edition. The distinction between Johnson's biographies and the poetry collection in which they first appeared is blurred once more when St Clair records "1797. Johnson's Poets abridge " (p. 547), implying that the collection (i.e., Johnson's Poets ) was truncated into some sort of miscellany. For this entry he cites A Bookseller of the Last Century (London, 1885), but Charles Welsh listed "Johnson's Lives of Poets. Abridged. 1797" (p. 346). 3,000 1780. 9 9. For this item St Clair cites the Murray archive, courtesy of William Zachs, The First John Murray and the Late Eighteenth-Century Book Trade (Oxford, 1998), p. 296. Yet he transcribes the datum incorrectly, substituting "1780" for the actual "1781" given by Zachs. Although a Dublin reprint of Johnson's prefaces appeared in 1780 (the first of three eventual volumes in that set), St Clair refers to the four-volume reprint, which could not have been published before 1781 (as the years cited in the previous entry suggest), when Johnson completed his work. The Lives of the most eminent English poets, four volumes, 8vo. 3,000 1793. 10 10. James Moore began reprinting The Works of the English Poets in 1793, but his labor lasted a decade, with publication spanning 1795–1802. In a reissue of the set under a false imprint—"London: Printed for Andrew Miller, Strand"—all eight volumes bear the year 1800. Dublin, eight volumes. Offshore pirated edition. 11 11. This work was no straightforward reprint of the 1779–81 collection, as seemingly indi- cated here. It contained the same number of poets (fifty-two), but dropped Blackmore, Ambrose Philips, Pitt, Watts, and Gilbert West from that edition, while incorporating an equal number from among the fourteen poets added to the 1790 edition: Cawthorne, Churchill, Falconer, Lloyd, and Moore. The publisher dramatically reduced the number of volumes involved by printing the poetry in double columns on a larger page. … 1810. 12 12. In 1810 an edition of The Works of the English Poets was indeed published, but not by this description. Again, the edition made up of seventy-five volumes was published in 1790. London. Johnson's Poets was officially reprinted without the prefaces 14 14. It would have been most curious for "Johnson's Poets" to be reprinted without Johnson's prefaces, when every title-page in the collection advertises the "Prefaces, Biographical and Critical, by Samuel Johnson." (See note 30.) in seventy-five volumes. 15 15. Again, it was the 1790 edition that had seventy-five volumes. The 1810 edition had twenty-one. 168s. Addison, Akenside, … Dilke, 16 16. In the roster of poets from the 1790 edition the name "Dilke" turns up. Who is this mysterious poet? … Young, Whitehead. 1500 or 1250 each 13 13. 1500 or 1250? St Clair explains, "The print runs, more for the lives than for the works, are apparently those noted for 1806 in John Nichols' ledger of purchase and disposal of copyrights 1769–1815, CUL add. 8226." What the distinction between "lives" and "works" can mean is unclear, given St Clair's impression that the lives were not reprinted with this collec- tion. (See note 14.)The ledger entry at issue (p. 108) is genuinely puzzling: "Johnson's Lives and Poets— 5/100ths produces 75 in 1500; + 18 of the Works in 1250." An annotation ("Allowed in 1801.") in reference to the first part of this entry may point to an 1801 edition of Johnson's Lives, two volumes of which were printed by Nichols in a run of 1500. One purpose of the entry, then, might have been Nichols' need to update his accounts in light of having just sold a fifth of his interest to Cadell + Davies on 4 March 1806, which left him (as he duly records) with 4/100ths. This explanation assumes the formulation "Lives and Poets" to have been loose and inaccurate. Yet 1806 was also the year in which Nichols and other publishers brought out an edition of Johnson's Works, volumes IX—XI of which (i.e., the Lives ) Nichols printed in quantities sufficient for the complete works and also a separate issue for sale as a stand-alone set (with new title-pages, vols. I–III). See J. D. Fleeman, A Bibliography of the Works of Samuel Johnson, 2 vols. (Oxford, 2000), 2: 1398–1400, 1405–7, 1661–7. This farrago tells a bewildering tale: three long decades elapsed before the land- mark collection was reprinted officially; when that time arrived, the proprietors (despite there being more readers in the nation) cut their print run in half, from 3,000 to either 1500 or 1250; they kept the collection static, reprinting the same number of volumes; and they jettisoned the very feature that had given their edition its identity, Johnson's prefaces. None of this is true. A glance at the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature or the English Short Title Catalogue, both of which show the seventy-five volume version of The Works of the English Poets to have been a distinct publication in 1790, would have kept the descriptions of the 1779–81 and 1810 editions from getting quite so muddled. The entry for an "1810" edition is instructive, however, for what belonged here was the actual 1810 edition, The Works of the English Poets from Chaucer to Cow- per, including the series edited … by Dr. Samuel Johnson, edited by Alexander Chalm- ers. Yet because this collection turns up four pages later (p. 531) under another rubric ("Attempts by the pretender copyright holders to offset the shortcomings of Johnson"), most readers will fail to grasp that Chalmers' edition—many of its proprietors being sons, surviving partners, or successors to the publishers of the 1779–81 and 1790 editions—was an enormously confident expansion of the same project. Equally disorienting as this bibliographical jumble are several claims made about The Works of the English Poets. St Clair points out that the London partners had greater financial power than Bell, but that their decision to sell their collec- tion "as a traditional, immobile, multi-volume, 'library' edition … showed how little they had as yet understood the forces set free by 1774" (p. 126), set free, that is, by the copyright ruling in Donaldson v. Becket . 17 17. By calling such an edition "traditional," St Clair clouds the fact that such multi- volume collections were currently taking shape for the first time. Only later could they be said to have become traditional. On the contrary, the proprietors knew their business well. To sell the collection in complete sets, which probably was their original plan, became their only feasible option as events transpired: it was the only way to exploit the market value of the prefaces, which were printed to be bound with the works of each poet, after they had decided (because of John- son's tardy progress) to gather them into separate volumes. 18 18. See Thomas F. Bonnell, "Patchwork and Piracy: John Bell's 'Connected System of Biography' and the Use of johnson's Prefaces" Studies in Bibliography 48 (1995)) 193–194. They would have undermined their entire scheme had they, as St Clair wrongly asserts, "Soon … agreed to sell individual volumes as well as the whole set and lowered the planned price. Having lost the legal war of 1774, they could still win the commercial war of 1779" (p. 126). Although readers clamored to be permitted to buy individual volumes, especially Johnson's Prefaces, the publishers stood their ground. But even supposing they had relented, and sold volumes individually by 1788, that would not be "soon" after publication, nor could a tactical change in 1799 be regarded as part of the commercial war of 1779. 19 19. For the mistaken inference that some volumes had been sold separately by 1788, see note 8. The " London Catalogue (1799)," cited for the datum that volumes were "sold as individual titles" (p. 527), contains no such information. In The London Catalogue of Books, with their Sizes and Prices (London, 1799), the "English Poets, with Prefaces, 75 vol. 12mo" is listed at £13.2.6 (p. 52), slightly more than the £12.17.6 it commanded in 1791, according to The London Cata- logue of Books (London, 1791), p. 59. As for the first edition in sixty-eight volumes, it was listed for £10.4.0 in A General Catalogue of Books (London, 1785), p. 59, a small reduction from its original price of ten guineas (bound) in 1781. Nowhere do the catalogues hint that the collection was available in any form less than its entirety. Intervals of ten or twenty years brought great changes to this market; with the passage of each decade, the canon in its published forms became ever more intricately shaped by its prior evolution. The same imprecision undercuts the claim that "the Bell and the Johnson editions quickly sold out, and both were reprinted" (p. 127). It hardly qualifies as "quickly" for Bell's edition to have been reprinted in 1807 (p. 526), or the London trade edition in 1810, these being the years specified by St Glair. But the editions actually were reprinted fairly quickly—individual volumes of Bell more or less continuously over a period of twenty-five years after first publication, and the collection of the London conger in 1790, which is doubly impressive given that the proprietors not only increased the number of volumes to seventy-five, but still required the purchase of complete sets. 20 20. What St Clair means by saying that the "first edition" of Bell's series was "out of print by 1805" is unclear (p. 525), given his realization that many volumes (which were sold individu- ally) required reprinting earlier on, several more than once. He draws on data from my article "John Bell's Poets of Great Britain: The 'Little Trifling Edition' Revisited," Modern Philology 85 (1987), 128–152, and mentions my name in a footnote (p. 525), but neither cites that article here nor includes it in his bibliography. A trace of it appears in the front matter, however, where a shortened citation is supplied among the "Abbreviations" (p. xv). Unlike the Scottish publishers, who were "boxed in by the terms of the 1710 Act," the copyright owners in London, St Clair asserts, had "the whole of recent as well as older English literature from which to make their choice." Faced with the Scottish onslaught (St Clair believes Bell to have published from Scotland, more on which below), they felt "the need for unity keenly," and "only in the case of Goldsmith, a poet still much in demand, did any of the owners … refuse to cooperate" (p. 125). In due course, however, Chaucer and other early poets were omitted from the collection because "In the competition for space the modern in-copyright poets and a few weak early eighteenth-century poets for whom there was said to be a continuing demand, were given priority" (p. 126). By this ac- count, sundry London publishers allowed their in-copyright poets (except Gold- smith) to be incorporated into the collection, having overcome their self-interest in otherwise protecting their investments, driven by the extraordinary need to distinguish their collection from that of their Scottish challengers. If only it were true. Who these modem poets might have been is not revealed. In St Clair's verdict—"As events turned out, the initial commissioning of 'John- son's Poets' was the only occasion ever when a comprehensive canon of old and new poets could have been selected and made available in a uniform series, and the opportunity was missed" (p. 127)—what prevented the collection from being comprehensive was the omission of Chaucer, Spenser, and others. The weak early eighteenth-century poets who crowded them out can be identified (Dorset, Stepney, Walsh, Duke, and others 21 21. See Bonnell, The Most Disreputable Trade: Publishing the Classics of English Poetry 1765–1810 (Oxford, 2008), p. 172. ), but which "new poets" added to this pres- sure? Not one in-copyright poet is cited as evidence, which lessens the impression of selfless solidarity on the part of the London publishers. This will surprise no one familiar with the collection, however, for in fact the London trade included not a single recent poet who was not also reprinted by Bell. John Bell is no obscure figure. He has been called "indisputably the most versatile member of the London printing trade at any period," and Stanley Mor- ison's book-length tribute sheds light on every aspect of his remarkable career. 22 22. P. M. Handover, Printing in London from 1476 to Modern Times (Cambridge, MA, 1960), p. 148; Stanley Morison, John Bell, 1745–1831: Bookseller, Printer, Publisher, Typefounder, Journal- ist, &amp;c. (London and Cambridge, 1930). Yet St Clair refers to him as the "successor" of Alexander Kincaid, the Edinburgh printer and publisher; identifies him as an "Edinburgh publisher" in the index; posits that, in order to market his Poets of Great Britain, he "open[ed] his own shop in London to sell direct to English customers"; and stirringly concludes, "An outsider had established himself in the heart of their empire" (pp. 124–125). 23 23. The germ of this mistake was perhaps the letter books of Kincaid and Bell, 1764–72, in the Bodleian, listed in the bibliography (p. 725), which St Clair evidently consulted with the wrong John Bell in mind. Kincaid's business partner in Edinburgh was a different John Bell (1735–1806). Their partnership was dissolved (he was not "Kincaid's successor"), and he later formed the Edinburgh firm of Bell and Bradfute. See Richard B. Sher's entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Bell had his series printed in Edinburgh, but that does not make him an Edin- burgh publisher, nor does it qualify his edition to be classified in Appendix 6 as an instance of "The Edinburgh poetry canon made available in a cheap uniform series in England." 24 24. Even more anomalous under the rubric of "The Edinburgh poetry canon" is the next listing, a reprint of Bell's edition produced in London. See pp. 525–526. To the exasperation of his rivals, Bell was all too vitally a true London publisher. No one who had looked at both collections could claim that "Bell's edition…, like Kincaid's, was … illustrated with engravings, and each volume carried a short biographical and critical introduction" (p. 124). 25 25. In specifying the year 1778 here for Bell's series, St Clair ignores his own data in Ap- pendix 6, where he records 1776–1782. Several such inconsistencies crop up between text and appendix. To suggest that these features are found in the Edinburgh series (they are not) obfuscates a crucial development in the evolution of the printed canon. It was Bell who decided that every volume in a project like this should contain an illustration, Bell who recognized that the works of every poet should have a preface. 26 26. See Bonnell, The Most Disreputable Trade, pp. 98–99, 134. As essential components of his design, these features were innovations which (among others instituted by Bell) came to define what British readers expected from this kind of canonical collection. St Clair muddies the water also by scrambling the chronology of Bell's career. With "the law, and many English book buyers, now on his side"—the buyers, that is, of Bell's Poets, who had never before "been offered such a literary and artistic feast for their sixpence" 27 27. Here St Clair confuses the price of Bell's volumes, which sold for 1s.6d. (correctly noted in Appendix 6), with that of Charles Cooke's Select British Poets. —St Clair states that "Bell's business prospered. Soon he was producing attractive, illustrated editions of plays, Bell's British The- atre and Bell's Shakespeare, and he started to move into publishing new titles and newspapers. In the later 1770s, Bell arranged to print his books in London, and this seems to have been the last straw for the English publishers. … It was only then, when bullying and smear tactics failed, that they decided that they would have to meet Bell's challenge face on and produce their own directly competing uniform series" (p. 125). Hesitating to compete head on against Bell's Poets while he introduced project after project to the market would have been oddly lax on the part of the London trade. That did not happen. Bell's career unfolded in precisely the opposite order: his newspaper activity, begun in 1772, established a platform for vigorous advertising; Shakespeare's works appeared in 1774 28 28. Conflicting publication years are given for this edition in the chapter on Shakespeare, 1774 in the narrative (p. 142) and 1773/75 in Table 8.1, where the number of volumes recorded is also incorrect. ; and Bell's British Theatre ignited a battle in 1776 (waged against the New English Theatre ), foreshadowing the war to come over the poets. 29 29. Bonnell, "John Bell's Poets of Great Britain," 140–141. Publication of The Poets of Great Britain started in 1777, but before the first volume actually went on sale, the London trade—fully apprised of Bell's intentions—had already organized itself to produce a rival collection. St Clair's methodology is rendered moot by all these stumbles, for they make it impossible to discern true patterns or to identify the turning points that estab- lished facts are supposed to clarify. As distortions mount up, the picture grows ever more confused, until virtually nothing is accurately presented (or distinctly known) of the central trade rivalry that shaped every aspect of the poetry canon as it evolved after 1776. Many of these problems would not have arisen had the proper bibliographies been checked; nearly all would have been averted by recourse to the physical books under discussion. As for the archival findings, pre- sented in tables and appendices with every assurance of authority, most readers will be at a loss to sense what information is suspect and what is reliable. Unwit- tingly, St Clair offers a negative object lesson with respect to books and publish- ers' archives, one that proves more convincingly than he knew how indispensable facts are. An archive is liable to be misinterpreted if one comes to it lacking a thorough familiarity with the relevant books. William Thomas Lowndes Redivivus Two (perhaps three) of the mistakes noted above—the incorrect format for the 1779–81 edition of The Works of the English Poets, and the publication year of the Irish reprint—are traceable to The Bibliographer's Manual of English Literature, compiled by William Thomas Lowndes in 1834, republished from 1857 through 1864 with many articles "enlarged, entirely re-written, or added by Mr. Bohn," and reprinted in 1869. 30 30. William Thomas Lowndes, The Bibliographer's Manual of English Literature, 4 vols. (Lon- don: William Pickering, 1834), and William Thomas Lowndes, The Bibliographer's Manual of English Literature, a new edition, revised, corrected and enlarged … by Henry G. Bohn, 6 vols. (London: Bell &amp; Daldy; New York: Scribner, Welford, &amp; Co., 1869). The third error possibly related to Lowndes is the idea that a seventy-five volume edition of The Works of the English Poets was published "without the prefaces" (see note 14). In Lowndes' original entry for the poetry collection, the 1779–81 and the 1790 editions were listed in tandem, each followed by catalogue listings of specific sets with prices affixed. The pertinent portion of the entry stood thus: "Heath, 1870, 58 vols. in 57, 10 l. 10s. Hollis, 387, 77 vols. 8 l 8s.—Lond. 1790 12mo. 75 vols." (1834, 3: 1472–73). Bohn eliminated several catalogue listings, but also clarified the Heath citation to indicate that this particular set of the 1779–81 edition lacked volumes 59–68. With Bohn's adjustments, the same portion of the entry now looked like this: "Heath, 1870, 58 vols. in 57 ( i.e., without Johnson's Prefaces) 10 l . 10s.—Lond. 1790 12mo. 75 vols." (1869, 4: 1897). A misreading of this close conjunction of words and figures (situated eye-catchingly at the bottom of the column in Bohn's revision) might have led to the idea that the 1790 edition lacked Johnson's work. Henry G. Bohn revised the article on "Poets," quadru- pling the original entry of Lowndes from one to four columns, and adding a fifth to cover collections published after 1830. 31 31. The "principal articles" contributed by Bohn are enumerated in the front matter to The Bibliographer's Manual (1869), 1: xiv. St Clair mined this material for Ap- pendix 6, unaware that it was often faulty. One big slip concerns the publisher Charles Cooke, a key player in the evolu- tion of the canon. Figure 3 in The Reading Nation, an advertisement for Cooke's publications, pictures a list of forty-six poets under "Select Poets" (p. 129). This illustration, though a fine piece of evidence in itself, betrays a worrisome level of inattention, for the list does not match the roster of Cooke's collection in Appendix 6 (p. 528). That roster is not Cooke's, but rather Bell's, erroneously attributed to Cooke by Bohn when expanding Lowndes. 32 32. The Bibliographer's Manual (1869), 4: 1898. St Clair's failure to spot the mismatch is surprising not only because Bohn's list starts with "Chaucer, 14 vols. Spenser, 8 vols. Donne, 3 vols."—poets conspicuously absent from Cooke's series—but also because he shows interest in the number of times Donne was reprinted in the eighteenth century (p. 128) and knows full well, from having described how Chaucer was "squeezed out" of the London trade edition (p. 126), what level of economic investment was inherent in reprinting such a voluminous poet. 33 33. St Clair's point would have been even stronger had he realized that the volumes in question were small octavo, not duodecimo. In Bell's 109-volume octodecimo project, the works of Chaucer and Spenser accounted for fourteen and eight volumes respectively, or 20% of his capital investment. New life is also breathed into other inaccuracies about Cooke's poetry series copied from Lowndes: that it began in 1798, and was published in eighty parts. It began in 1794, and continued (by my calculation) through 136 parts—data not easily unearthed, for Cooke did not include the year of publication in his imprints, and I have never been able to locate a complete set. St Clair cannot be criticized for declining to enter this bibliographical labyrinth, but the same cannot be said for his lack of curiosity about a publisher whom he calls "in many ways the most innovative and entrepreneurial of the publishers who entered the new competitive reprint business after 1774" (p. 131). He offers no first name ("Cooke, publisher" is the index entry), and conflates the careers of father and son (as the old DNB did under "John Cooke"), ignoring the separate identities assigned to John and Charles in a source he consulted, Rees and Britton. 34 34. Thomas Rees, Reminiscences of Literary London from 1779 to 1853 … with extensive ad- ditions by John Britton, F.S.A. (New York, 1896), pp. 26–28. St Clair quotes from this book on pp. 131, 134, and 528. See Bonnell, "Cooke, John, and Charles Cooke," Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 61 vols. [Oxford, 2004], 13: 155–156. Al- though Rees and Britton are vague about when Charles assumed control of the business, they credit him with having "commenced a new course" with Hume's History of England and a series of popular novels in weekly numbers. Bohn's refer- ence to "G. A. Cooke" is a red herring, to be sure, but if St Clair was distracted by it, he could have turned to the books themselves, all of which bear "C. Cooke" in their imprints, or checked Ian Maxted (listed in his bibliography), who identi- fies Charles as the publisher who "Began to publ. series of 12mo classics neatly embellished by engravings c. 1793." 35 35. The London Book Trades 1775–1800: A Preliminary Checklist of Members (Folkestone, 1977), p. 50. Over the course of a dozen years after 1793, several strands of the overall canonical enterprise were brought together by Cooke. St Clair is indefinite on the dates of each venture. Figure 3 is labeled "c. 1810," but in Appendix 6 "1798 onwards" is given for the poetry (p. 528); 36 36. The advertisement in Figure 3 shows the poetry series as it stood early in 1805, before it was complete. "begun late 1790s" for the novels (p. 535); "c. 1803" for the essays (p. 538); 37 37. The advertisement leading St Clair to infer "c. 1803" for this series, unaccountably, is found in a book that includes "inscriptions [which] show it is before 1803." and no date for the plays (p. 538). 38 38. The titles of various collections of plays are listed without dates or numbers of vol- umes. Cooke's British Theatre cannot be called "one of the first" when Bell's British Theatre (not to mention the New English Theatre or Joseph Wenman's series, neither noted by St Clair) ante- dated it perhaps by forty years. Indeed, Cooke's collection was possibly a reissue of Bell's series with newly commissioned copperplates. The scenes depicted in Cooke's Illustrations to the British Theatre (n.d.; engravings dated 1816–21) are all from plays included in the 1790s expansion of Bell's original late-1770s production. Given that Charles Cooke died in 1816, the fact that these plates were "Printed for C. Cooke" complicates the puzzle. (A fifth series mentioned in Chapter 7, the Sacred Classics, is absent from Appen- dix 6.) The year to mark for the poetry series should have been 1794, after the novels had been launched successfully in 1793. The correct sequence indicates another significant "turning point": whereas Bell advanced from Shakespeare to a drama series and then to the poets of the nation, Cooke tested the market with novels, then moved on to the poets and the other genres. This contrast be- tween the 1770s and 1790s—in publishers so innovative and keenly attuned to the wants of the reading public—suggests that tastes began shifting long before the 1830s, the decade identified by St Clair when "Poetry seemed suddenly to have lost its long primacy as the most highly regarded literary genre and as the form most favoured by readers" (pp. 413–414). 39 39. Critical regard and popular favor, of course, are not the same thing. The word "sud- denly" in this context—like "soon" and "quickly" in the passags discussed above—is mislead- ing and overly dramatic. In choosing novels for his maiden series before attempting poetry, Cooke perhaps heeded the lesson of Joseph Wenman, a bookseller who published The Poetical Magazine; or Parnassian Library in the early 1780s in tandem with The Entertaining Museum, or Complete Circulating Library. 40 40. St Clair lists these publications on pp. 527 and 535, respectively, without naming Wenman in relation to either, and perhaps without recognizing the connection between them. For information on The Poetical Magazine he gives a mongrel citation ("Bonnell, 'Bookselling' 151"), which joins the correct page number from one of my articles (the one absent from his bibliography; see note 20) to the title of a different article. Wenman is discussed by name in the article. Wenman could not sustain The Poetical Magazine, a down-market imitation of Bell's edition at one-third the price, or sixpence per volume, for the level of readership he had targeted; he could not market a poetry series to them without bringing prose works into the mix. Undoubtedly the novel gained a new respectability in the minds of aspiring authors in the nineteenth century, as St Clair argues, but poetry did not therefore "suddenly" lose its elite status in the 1830s. Cooke perceived that many readers in the 1790s preferred prose to poetry; for such readers poetry had not lost its pri- macy, but had never enjoyed it. Wenman's turnabout and the success of Cooke's experiments, even as Bell's series and the London trade edition continued to prosper, suggest how difficult it is to broadly characterize what the generality of readers favor in any era. Blind reliance on Lowndes leads to another error, slight in itself, but one that masks how resourceful publishers could be in marketing products to a range of buyers. St Clair declares "The Poets of Great Britain, 18mo., 124 volumes bound as sixty two" to be merely a "reprint of Bell's Poets" (p. 526). Even the greater clarity of NCBEL ("A reprint, with additional volumes, of Bell's Edition") pro- vides no clue that Samuel Bagster and his co-proprietors dropped eleven of Bell's 109 volumes before adding twenty-six, but something more interesting is detected if one examines several sets of the edition: it was sold in two forms under different titles to accommodate readers of different means. Purchasers of double-bound sets opened to a half-title page in each of sixty-one volumes (not sixty-two; two were triple-bound) that read The Poets of Great Britain, in Sixty-One Double Volumes. Customers able to afford twice as many bindings, by contrast, bought sets with half-title pages that read The Poets of Great Britain, in One Hundred and Twenty-Four Volumes, with different volume numbers and different poets assigned to them. St Clair notes that this collection was described in the Longman impression books as "Johnson's British Poets"—a curious designation, given its lineal descent from Bell's edition. The irony passes without explanation. 41 41. Bagster's collection actually contained Johnson's prefaces, a fact that heightens rather than lessens the irony, and makes it even more inappropriate for this entry to fall under the rubric of "The Edinburgh poetry canon." (See note 24.) This edition of the Lives has hitherto escaped detection, and is not recorded in A Bibliography of the Works of Samuel Johnson. Another inaccuracy dating back to The Bibliographer's Manual taints the entry for "The Works of the British Poets, with Prefaces Biographical and Critical, by Rob- ert Anderson. Edinburgh, 1793–1807" (p. 526): fourteen volumes, not thirteen, made a full set in 1807. 42 42. Thirteen volumes constituted a complete set in 1795, but a fourteenth volume was added in 1807—information available in the NCBEL. Two additional mistakes are contributed by St Clair: that it was produced by "a consortium of Edinburgh and Glasgow publishers/ printers," and was sold out by 1805. The assertion that Glasgow entered the picture is baffling, when the title-pages suggest the other proprietary interest to have been a London firm, John and Arthur Arch, who joined the Edinburgh venture after Bell and Bradfute had taken over the project from the printers who originated it, Mundell and Son. And how could it be sold out by 1805 when its publication extended to 1807? St Clair misreads a letter from Sir Walter Scott to James Ballantyne in 1805, in which Johnson's edition is reported to be "out of print; so is Bell's." Scott finds Anderson's edition "contemptible in execution," but does not say it is out of print. It was not. The full collection was available in 1805, in 1807 (augmented by the fourteenth volume), and even in 1814. 43 43. Thomas Constable, Archibald Constable and his Literary Correspondents: A Memorial, 3 vols. (Edinburgh, 1873), 1:176 The New London Catalogue of Books, Sizes and Prices (1805), p. 4; The New London Catalogue of Books, with Their Sizes and Prices (1807), p. 4; and The London Catalogue of Books, with Their Sizes and Prices (1814), p. 21. By appropriating data about several poetry collections from Lowndes without inspecting the books themselves and correcting errors, St Clair inadvertently has provided a rule for using Appendix 6: to approach it as one would The Bib- liographer's Manual. Dipping into Lowndes always yields something worthwhile; it is a marvelous source, pleasurably more scattershot than systematic, but any datum of interest must be vetted thoroughly before it can be applied to further scholarly pursuits. Other slips too counsel vigilance. One name is missing from the list of poets in The Cabinet of Poetry, for instance, and St Clair's speculation that this anthol- ogy was "Perhaps extracted from Anderson's edition" overlooks the poets not in Anderson (pp. 526–527). 44 44. In so far as it goes his speculation is accurate, for the editor drew on the prefaces from Anderson's collection. But the fact that poets besides those in Anderson were also included points to a wider context for The Cabinet of Poetry. Under an entry for British Classics he gratuitously explains that the term "British" in the title "enabled Falconer and Thomson, who were Scottish, not English, to be included" (p. 533), yet Falconer was also included in series that were designated as "English," and Thomson figured in them all, irrespective of their titles. In the pages examined thus far, the goal of establishing a factual basis for further scholarly work has eluded St Clair. My corrections surely are not the sort of exercise he had in mind when saying that his appendices "can be added to by anyone who chooses to do the spade-work" (p. 16). Through errors of omission and commission he has left his readers to perform routine bibliographical checks in sources he bypassed, like NCBEL or ESTC; to rectify conflicting titles and publication years of works mentioned more than once; to sort out discrepancies between various pieces of evidence; to puzzle over contradictions between his data and claims; and to double-check his printed sources to make sure he has not jumbled or skipped over important information. Alert readers might catch a few such lapses, but only someone intimately conversant with the field is apt to sense when printed sources are quoted or paraphrased inaccurately, and thus know when to track down and clear up suspicious claims. The "Old Canon"—How Sudden and How Rigid? While the case of Donaldson v. Becket was undeniably historic, its consequences should not be overstated. This copyright ruling in the House of Lords in 1774 did not open the way to publishing a canon of English literature. Material expres- sions of a literary canon were brought about by social and economic forces, in combination with intellectual ferment in various quarters. What the legal deci- sion did was to facilitate the process; it set the stage for accelerated growth in the production and distribution of canonical series of every description. Narrowly focusing on London, St Clair states that deference to the notion of perpetual copyright "prevented formal canonizing, the publication of the works of authors in a uniform series of 'English Poets.' Before 1774, a proposal to pub- lish such a series, from, say Chaucer to Thomson, would have involved research among the records of the Stationers' Company, publishers' wills, and the book trade's closed sales catalogues." But then we are told that, because the Scots operated under the 1710 copyright act "long before 1774, it is not surprising that the first formal canons of the classics of the English language should have been produced not in England but in Scotland" (p. 123). So formal canonizing did occur before 1774, just not in London. Often, though, St Clair disregards this crucial qualification and resorts to absolute language, as in characterizing the old canon as "a direct result of the legal judgement of 1774, and only made possible by 1774" (p. 132). Since such categorical statements are frequent, my point too bears repetition: the decision in Donaldson v. Becket, while furthering the formation of literary canons through multi-volume series by ushering such commerce into the heart of British publishing, did not bring about this type of publication in the first place. Other causes must be sought to account for it. 45 45. St Glair uses the refrain "After 1774 the book became cheap and plentiful" (or similar phrasing) often in Appendix 1, at times indiscriminately. Its application to Johnson's Rasselas (p. 472) is suspect because that title was eligible for copyright protection through 1786. Or again, the explanation 'Benefited from the brief copyright window and became cheap and plentiful' is misleading in connection with a 1791 edition of Mackenzie's The Man of Feeling (p. 473), which, first published in 1771, was protected through 1798, whether the copyright was held by Mackenzie, who died in 1831, or his assigns. Other effects attributed to the legal decision are similarly overstated: "One of the most far-reaching consequences of 1774 was to allow a revival of the types of printed text which had been discouraged after 1600 … above all, antholo- gies" (p. 135); and "The decision of 1774 also made possible a new generation of textbooks and school books … which drew on, anthologized, and abridged the out-of-copyright authors" (p. 137). A few counter-examples will suffice to suggest that these claims are shaky. As for the revival of the anthology as a kind of printed text after 1774, the NCBEL tells a different story. Thousands of anthologies and miscellanies, printed all through the eighteenth century, demonstrate that the "huge spate of antholo- gies … which draw on the old-canon texts" after 1774 (p. 495) was preceded by a huge spate before 1774. Their character did not instantly change: many printed before 1774 drew on old-canon texts; many after 1774 continued to be topical or occasional (as opposed to canonical). James Elphinston's A Collection of Poems, from the Best Authors (1764), for instance, contained works by Dryden, Pope, Swift, Addison, Prior, Gray, and others; The Beauties of English Poesy. Selected by Oliver Goldsmith (1767) included Milton, Dryden, Pope, Swift, Johnson, Shenstone, and others. Differences of degree more than differences of kind characterize the an- thologies printed before and after 1774. The findings of Michael Suarez and Barbara Benedict on eighteenth-century anthologies would have brought nuance to the argument at this juncture. 46 46. Michael F. Suarez, S.J., "The Production and Consumption of the Eighteenth-Century Poetic Miscellany," in Books and their Readers in Eighteenth-Century England: New Essays, ed. Isabel Rivers (London and New York, 2001); and Barbara Benedict, Making the Modern Reader: Cultural Mediation in Early Modem Literary Anthologies (Princeton, 1996). The border dividing the literate nation from the reading nation was dissolving, but it happened over a longer stretch of time than St Clair suggests. A "long frozen culture … within which the reading poor had been constricted since the early seventeenth century" did not thaw in an instant after 1774, nor were most readers all that while "restricted to an ancient chapbook with a few pages and a crude woodcut," or "a copy of some anciently written, but recently reprinted, book of advice on religious practice and moral conduct, and an anthology or two of old-canon verse" (pp. 138–139). This be- fore-and-after scenario is too starkly drawn. Likewise, the argument that a fresh breed of educational text was newly "made possible" is overly emphatic: "Quite suddenly, in the course of a few years from about 1780, English literature became the principal source of texts for Eng- lish education …. Children were now offered substantial passages from famous English authors" (p. 137). The force of this generalization, stressing suddenness, is blunted by evidence like Elphinston's text, specifically "Adopted to every age, but peculiarly designed to form the Taste of Youth," or John Entick's New Spelling Dictionary (1765), a "Complete Pocket Companion / For those / That read Mil- ton, Pope, Addison, Shakespear, Tillotson and Locke, or other English Authors of Repute in Prose or Verse." Movement toward a curriculum based on readings of classic English authors (embodied in the first of these texts, complemented in the second) had thus begun before Donaldson v. Becket was decided, and therefore, like formal canonizing, cannot be ascribed to that cause categorically. Did the trend accelerate? Perhaps, but it was already under way. Of pivotal concern to St Clair is the "astonishing conservatism" (p. 130) of the poetry canon from the late eighteenth century into the early Victorian era. The old canon, he states, was "the first … to be made widely and cheaply available, the most stable, the most frequently reprinted, and the longest lived" (p. 128). While a new canon began to arise in the 1850s, published by Gall and In- glis (1853–1890s), then Roudedge (beginning in the late 1850s), and later Warne (1865 onward) (pp. 715–717), the "old canon of the British poets finally came to an end" only with the " The Classic Poets, a series launched in 1870 by Robert Bell … at the time when the poets of the romantic period were at last all coming out of copyright." 47 47. After calling it The Classic Poets here, he refers to die collection in Appendix 6 as Bell's English Poets / Begun 1870 … / Discontinued" (p. 549). Might this be Robert Bell's Annotated Edition of the English Poets (29 vols., 1854–57), as cited by Bohn (also noting that it was "Discon- tinued") in The Bibliographer's Manual (1869; p. 1900) and by Robert Crawford in The Modern Poet: Poetry, Academia, and Knowledge Since the 1750s (Oxford, 2001; p. 85)? Having established this criterion for the emergence of a new canon—the lapse of copyright for all the romantic poets—St Clair asserts that the old canon "had lasted more than a hundred years" (p. 128). The old canon, as defined by St Clair, "began with Chaucer and ended with Cowper. In some old-canon lists there are more than fifty authors, in others a dozen or less, but the core was nearly always the same. It consisted, alphabeti- cally, of Samuel Butler, some works of Chaucer, Collins, Cowper, Dryden, Fal- coner, Gay, Goldsmith, Gray, Milton, Pope, Shakespeare, Spenser, Thomson, and Young" (p. 128). Was this true in 1798? 1837? It is hard to see how St Clair's roster can be of much use to historians without knowing how it was derived. To frame hypotheses worth testing, a sounder factual basis is needed: first, more precise reference points within the hundred-year span; second, a more definite focus on the types of publication in question; and third, more accurate lists of the poets. For instance, supposing St Clair's list to describe anthologies circa 1810, one might ask how they differed from their formal counterparts, the multi-volume collections. As a measure of such collections, his roster is woefully inaccurate, omitting nearly half of the core canon then current, for eleven additional poets— Addison, Akenside, Denham, Garth, Hammond, Lyttelton, Parnell, Prior, Shen- stone, Swift, and Waller—had appeared (or were advertised to appear) in at least twelve of the thirteen full-dress poetry collections published through 1810. Alternatively, supposing his roster to reflect the situation circa 1830, then it un- derscores a major erosion of the canon after Chalmers' edition in 1810, flatly disproving the claim that it was "locked in." Seemingly arbitrary, St Clair's defi- nition of the "core" of the old canon is inadequate to characterize one hundred years of poetry publication in Britain, or to support specific conclusions about reading at any point within that expanse of time. The macro level of book history falters if not grounded in micro-level specifics. Judging by his evidence, however, the canon was not static. True, the arti- ficial constraint of his fifteen-poet list enables St Clair to claim that the canon "contained no Gower, no Marlowe, nor any of the other contemporaries of Shakespeare, no Drayton, no Herrick, no Lovelace, no Marvell, no Herbert, and no women writers"; later, however, he names Gower and Drayton explicitly as being included in Chalmers' edition. He sets up another contradiction in stating that "the poets of the 1790s such as William Hayley and Charlotte Smith did not join the canon even when their works fell out of copyright," only to record their entry into the canon in 1825, along with Hannah More, Henry Kirke White, and Byron's Select Works, as sanctioned by Jones's Cabinet University Edition of the British Poets (pp. 128, 533–534). The presence of Smith and More here also belies the total exclusion of women. Evidence at variance with St Clair's argument can be found in other collections too. William Suttaby and Charles Corrall advertised The Poetical Works of Mrs. Elizabeth Rowe in a series alongside Shenstone, Milton, Young, Thomson, Pope, Gray, Somerville, Falconer, Goldsmith, and others. 48 48. The poets are listed in this order in an advertisement at the back of The Poetical Works of William Shenstone (London, 1804), with Rowe herself following Pope. Suttaby's offerings later grew into his "Miniature Library," by which time Mrs. Rowe's poetical works had been joined by Hester Chapone's letters ( The History of Sir Charles Grandison in a Series of Letters, 7 vols. [London, 1812], 7: sig. EE6). Dove's English Classics featured poems by Byron and the works of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. 49 49. A mixed-genre series, it also included works by Frances Burney, Elizabeth Inchbald, Clara Reeves, Hester Chapone, Mrs. Newel, and Mrs. Piozzi ("Dove's English Classics," advertisement on the back cover of Gay's Fables and Other Poems. Cotton's Visions in Verse. Moore's Fables for the Female Sex [London, 1826] in boards). St Clair provides ample evidence of women authors in the canon, but usually in other genres; his claim that there were no women pertains to the poetical canon. William Mavor and Samuel Jackson Pratt proudly intro- duced pieces "from the works of several modern poets of deserved eminence" in the 1820 edition of their Classical English Poetry for the Use of Schools, and Young Persons in General, among them Coleridge, Southey, Bowles, Thomas Campbell, Sir Walter Scott, Hannah More, and Mrs. Barbauld. Similarly eager to showcase up-to-date extracts, the editor of The Beauties of the Poets of Great Britain, Carefully Selected from the Works of the Best Authors (3 vols., London, 1826) reprinted verses by Wordsworth, Southey, Byron, Sir Walter Scott, Kirke White, and Thomas Moore, along with Mrs. Thrale, Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Opie and others. 50 50. An earlier edition of this anthology was published in 1821. More elastic and less ossified than St Clair would have it, the canon thus kept evolving in the first half of the nineteenth century. By the second half of the century a bifurcation was evident. The Edinburgh publisher William P. Nimmo, cited by St Clair, offers a fascinating case in point. Working on two fronts around 1869, he issued Editions of the Poets, a "Mid and late Victorian" collection con- taining the romantic poets (p. 715), meanwhile selling a 48-volume Large Print Unabridged Library Edition of the British Poets from Chaucer to Cowper (p. 548). 51 51. St Clair's information about the Large Print edition comes from a dated advertisement (1869) in The Poetical Works of Byron (n.d.); the data on Editions of the Poets comes from the same edition of Byron, plus Thomson (n.d.) and Books and Authors (n.d.). In the first of these, characterized also as "Nimmo's Popular Edition of the Works of the Poets," Longfellow, Scott, Byron, Moore, and Wordsworth joined the ranks of Cowper, Milton, Thomson, Beattie, Goldsmith, Pope, and Burns. In the other enterprise, supposedly restricted to the old canon, Nimmo filled six of forty-eight volumes with the poetry of William Lisle Bowles, Sir Walter Scott, Henry Kirke White, and James Grahame, violating the advertised limits of the series. 52 52. "Nimmo's Library Edition of Standard Works," a twenty-page advertisement bound in with The Autobiography of Flora M'Donald, 2 vols. (Edinburgh, 1870). According to Richard D. Altick, Nimmo made a practice of buying up odds and ends and publishing this stock in so many combinations that it would be "an almost hopeless task to disentangle and properly label the various series of reprints" sold under his name. The "Library Edition of the British Poets," he asserts, was a repackaging of George Gilfillan's series ("From Aldine to Everyman: Cheap Reprint Series of the English Classics 1830–1906," Studies in Bibliography 11 [1958], 14). By con- trast, there was no tampering with the poetic boundaries defined by "Chaucer to Cowper" when Minor English Poets 1660–1780 A Selection from Alexander Chalmers' "The English Poets" [1810] was reprinted a century later. 53 53. Selected from Chalmers' twenty-one volumes by David P. French, this collection itself ran to ten volumes, published by Benjamin Blom in New York in 1967. Generations have gone back to Alexander Chalmers, and Robert Anderson remained "well known to the public as the editor and biographer of the British Poets" for over fifty years, because what those editors did was never done again. 54 54. Chalmers' edition could still be purchased at mid-century; see The London Catalogue of Books Published in Great Britain (London, 1846), p. 61. The remark about Anderson comes from John Bowyer Nichols, Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century, 8 vols. (London, 1817–58), 7: 69. The point is not that the poets from Chaucer to Cowper were never again reprinted so comprehensively, which is obvious, but that publishers never again reprinted the poets of a preceding era so thoroughly. Victorian publishers canon- ized the Romantic poets in staggering print runs (in the tens of thousands), but without the same breadth of coverage. "Of the 2,000 or 3,000 or so poets who had tried their art and their luck during the age of Scott and Byron," St Clair observes, "only about twenty or thirty were ever later reprinted in Great Britain" (p. 305). Thus, even after the works of the Romantic poets were in the public domain, the "new" canons of Nimmo, or Routledge, or Gall and Inglis, were altogether differ- ent from the enormously capacious collections that Anderson and Chalmers were spurred to form. Nimmo freely reprinted Byron, Wordsworth, and Moore in one collection, but not the other. In the end, any resilience enjoyed by the old canon hinged less on the closing of "brief copyright windows" in 1808 and 1842 (pp. 127, 414) than on a loss of faith in the need for—and profitability of—a canon of that tremendous scope. In this respect the new canon was indeed wholly new. How readily the ideological bias of the old canon can be characterized is also open to debate. Anthologies of old-canon English literature, St Clair holds, "steep[ed] British children of the post-Enlightenment urban and industrialized nineteenth century in the pre-Enlightenment rural religious culture as it had been imagined and celebrated by writers of the previous century" (p. 137). While not "a fully coherent body of texts," old-canon poetry, novels, essays, and con- duct literature "shared many common features." The poets specifically wrote on "love of God, moral lessons, family love and affection, elegies for the dead"; they celebrated the values of a pre-industrial society; and "the poetry of the three favorites, Young, Thomson, and Cowper" both "implied and proclaimed" that God's benevolence "is proved by the design of the natural world." Poetry that praised Nature, God, and the rhythms of rural life in this manner was felt to inspire "awe, wonder, a sense of the sublime, and—therefore according to the theory of natural religion—a sense of piety" (p. 133). Publishers of "old-canon lists," by this account, "not only ignored the discoveries of the Enlightenment, but offered Counter-Enlightenment to readers who knew nothing of the Enlight- enment" (p. 134). The tenuousness of such blanket reasoning is suggested by the example of William Hone, the radical bookseller quoted by St Clair: when Cooke's Poets commenced, I bought the poems of Thompson and Goldsmith …. They were the first poems I read and I derived from them lasting benefit. The simplicity and tenderness of "The Deserted Village" and "The Traveller," and the just descriptions and noble sentiments of the "Seasons" refined and elevated my mind. I saw nature with a new-born sight; in its quiet scenery I felt emotions of peaceful delight unknown to me before—my affections went forth to every living thing; my heart expanded with raptur- ous joy. (p. 529) The lasting benefit of Hone's empathic expansion of heart expressed itself not in piety but in political satires, even "a parody of the biblical ten commandments" (p. 676). Neither religious awe nor reverence for nature is tied irrevocably to a single ideology. Love of God can lead to civil rights as well as to witch-hunts; the Bible has been used to defend slavery and to abolish it. Why, on the question of ideological selectivity, does the old canon core of fifteen poets shrink from fifteen to "the three favorites"? This is convenient, for Milton (ally to the regicides), Dryden, Pope, Swift, Prior, and Gay can hardly be seen as furthering a sense of rural religious quietism. If the ultimate purpose of a political economy of reading is to assess mentalities and learn "why as societies, we have come to think the way we do," the indeterminacy of the consequences of reading Thomson should give us pause. 55 55. "Attempts to equate literary texts with ideology have also proved unfruitful," St Clair later observes with more circumspection, quoting Raymond Williams' characterization of such attempts as "banging one inadequate category against another" (p. 439). Even supposing publishers and editors to have been enamored of a backward- leaning ideology, "old-canon lists" per se would not have been very useful to them. A case in point is provided by the Reverend John Adams, whose anthology, The English Parnassus (1789), has a lengthy subtitle: "Being a new selection of didactic, descriptive, pathetic, plaintive, and pastoral poetry, extracted from the works of the latest and most celebrated poets." Seeming to exemplify the rearguard tendencies described by St Clair, Adams emphasizes the morally instructive, the descriptive, and the rural; he includes Young, Thomson, and Cowper; and his avowed intention with each "extract" is "either to improve the taste of the young Reader, or to inspire sentiments of wisdom, virtue, and benevolence." Yet the anthology contains a host of other poets—more new than old, with five women. 56 56. "Advertisement," The English Parnassus (London, 1789), sig. A3. On the title page are listed "Dr. Beattie, Dr. Johnson, Dr. Hawksworth, Dr. Ogilvie, Dr. Young, Mrs. Barbauld, Miss Falconar [actually two sisters: Maria and Harriet], Miss Moore, Miss Carter, Hon. C. Fox, Churchill, Cowper, Hayley, Warton, Fitzgerald, Burns, Pratt, Jerningham, Pope, Thomson, Philips, Blair, &amp;c. &amp;c." Among the other poets is Ann Yearsley. Thus, depending on how one interprets Adams's design, his anthology unsettles St Clair's argument in one of two ways: an editor who wanted to advance piety needed either to ignore the traditional canon, since so much of it was ill suited to that end, or to let in other voices that better served the desired ideology (in the name of "the latest and most celebrated poets"), thereby altering the canon beyond recognition. Working toward a political economy of reading is a worthy endeavor, one that indeed requires many contributing hands. But such work is apt to wander astray when the actual, physical reading materials have not been inspected. The history of reading is indissolubly connected with book history, and neither can proceed without a solid grounding in bibliographical specifics. To get at those specifics, one must scrutinize not only multiple copies of the books themselves, but also newspapers, handbills, and any records left behind by the publishers: ledgers, receipts, correspondence, journals, and so forth. Hav- ing labored for a while in this vineyard, I can attest to the sometimes cryptic nature of isolated evidence—archival, bibliographical, or other—and the need to consult various sources. A closing mea culpa shows why. Writing about The British Poets (Edinburgh, 1773–76), I was deceived by the imprint in thirty (of forty-four) volumes: "Printed for A. Kincaid and W. Creech, and J. Balfour." I knew from reading the letters of William Creech that he and John Balfour were the moving spirits behind the project, and that Strahan had urged Kincaid not to involve himself; but, based on the imprint (which advertised the partnership between Kincaid and Creech), I concluded that Kincaid had joined in publishing the series. I was wrong. Kincaid had no financial stake in it, as I learned later by delving into a different archive; he merely allowed Creech, a newcomer to the trade, to continue using his well-established name in the imprint. 57 57. Although wrong about Kincaid's involvement, I established that Creech and Balfour were in charge of the series (Bonnell, "Bookselling and Canon-Making: The Trade Rivalry over the English Poets, 1776–1783," Studies in Eighteenth-Century Culture 19 [1989], 55–56). St Clair credits Kincaid with having planned the project (p. 124). Another deceptive element of the imprints is the year of publication in every volume (1773) except the final one (1776). By combing through notices in the Edinburgh newspapers, one learns that publication of the books lagged into 1774 and 1775. No one is more keenly aware of the importance of such archival sources than St Clair. His reminder that "the history of books is the history of an industry" (p. 445) underscores the relevance of economic analysis to the field, and places a premium on a "cumulative, accurate database of actual recorded costs, prices, print runs, method of manufacture, and sales of books, including imports, re- prints, adaptations, and abridgements" (p. 444). Rather than to refer his "read- ers back unassisted, to the scattered sources," St Clair loaded up his appendices with "quantified factual information on all the main genres of printed texts … of a comprehensiveness never previously attempted" (p. 16). Given the span of time he covers in The Reading Nation, and the range of genres addressed, his reach was bound to exceed his grasp. On the topic of the old canon, his readers must revisit the scattered sources after all, armed with better knowledge of the books in question. The current field of book history, St Clair believes, "tends to centre round the material artefact, rather than treating the recovery of the history of books as a first step towards recovering reading, itself a step in trying to improve our understanding of communication, cultural formation, and the construction of mentalities" (p. 444). Both the linear metaphor and the stated telos of book his- tory, as characterized here, can be debated. Yet the material artifact is so deeply implicated in any "further" conclusions that might be drawn from it—as a vivid, concrete expression of a mentality, for instance, designed by a publisher to gratify the needs or appetites of particular readers—that at some point in the process, a close look at it is essential. AUTHORS OF THE MIND: SOME NOTES ON THE QSUM ATTRIBUTION THEORY by Stephen Karian * * I am grateful to the following people who gave me advice and encouragement on this article: Amy L. Blair, Haruki Toyama, Jodi Melamed, James Woolley, and Maya C. Gibson. I am especially grateful to my father, Zaven A. Karian, who advised me on various statistical concepts. I alone am responsible for any errors in this article. Attribution matters. Many of us who study literary texts care who wrote what. Even if we are not engaged in biographical research, we often want to know which author or authors were involved with writing a work. Did Swift write A Letter of Advice to a Young Poet (1721)? What exactly did Defoe write? Can we determine if a particular work was the result of collaboration? Even scholars not directly involved with matters of attribution want a dependable basis from which to make further arguments. How did an author treat a particular topic in one work compared to another? How does a previously unknown and newly attributed work display the author's interests shown elsewhere? How does a new attribution alter our impressions of other works we know the author to have writ- ten? These kinds of questions—as well as their proposed answers—are rendered moot if we lack reliable evidence to support the attribution in the first place. Without this dependable knowledge, we run in circles, asking (and sometimes answering) irrelevant questions. 1 1. For a useful collection of essays on the broad subject of attribution in literary study, see Evidence for Authorship: Essays on Problems of Attribution, ed. David V. Erdman and Ephim G. Fogel (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1966). Though more than forty years old, this collection remains quite valuable. For a more recent discussion, see Harold Love, Attributing Authorship: An Introduction (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2002). Because attribution study lays foundations for others to build on, those who attribute authorship should be cautious. If and when these foundations crumble, the scholarly labor already performed is proven to be a waste of time and effort for all of us. Witness the energy expended to argue that Shakespeare wrote A Fu- nerall Elegye (1612): the attribution resulted in the poem's appearance in standard Shakespeare textbooks, from which it has begun to vanish now that some special- ists believe that John Ford wrote the poem. But who knows how long it will take for this poem to become fully dissociated from Shakespeare. Perhaps never. The lesson is a simple one: as difficult as it is to insert a newly attributed work into an author's canon, it is perhaps more difficult to remove an erroneously at- tributed work. It thus seems well worth spending time on the larger problem of attribution, and the role that non-specialists play or ought to play. As I am sug- gesting, we all have a stake in the matter, and therefore the importance of the subject deserves critical, even skeptical discussion. The demand for this skeptical approach is perhaps greater now than ever before. The emergence of large, textual databases and the growth of micro- computing power make statistically based (or at least numerically based) theories particularly appealing. And all too unfortunately, the quantitative approach is ac- corded an enormous amount of deference from the stereotypical humanists who are mathematically challenged. Or it might be more appropriate to say that such humanists either accept these theories at face value or reject them in toto without ever fully grappling with what such theories might have to offer. Journals such as Literary and Linguistic Computing and Computers and the Humanities publish material on the topic of attribution, but the methods and conclusions of these discussions rarely seem to reach "traditional" literary scholars. I do not wish to revisit the "two cultures" debate waged a long time ago. But given that quantitatively-based theories have already begun to shape our under- standing of authorship, it seems well past due to test them in a critical fashion, determine how well they hold up to scrutiny, and consider what implications we can draw. This is what I propose to do here with the attribution theory known as cusum analysis, often abbreviated as QSUM. 2 2. Here and throughout this paper I use the abbreviation QSUM to refer only to the attribution theory under discussion. The theory's proponents use both "QSUM" and "cusum analysis" interchangeably. As I discuss later, cumulative sum analysis (often abbrevi- ated CUSUM) can also refer to a statistical technique derived from another field.

Farringdon, and M. D. Baker. 3 3. Cardiff: Univ. of Wales Press, 1996. This book was favorably reviewed by Peter Smith in Forensic Linguistics 5 (1998): 77–79, by Kathryn Summers in D. H.

Lawrence did not write the short story "The Back Road" (1913); Muriel Spark's essay "My Conversion" (1961) was partly edited by journalist W. J. Weatherby; and Henry Fielding was the anonymous translator of Gustavus Adlerfeld's The Military History of Charles XII (1740). In a separate SB article, Jill Farringdon presents additional grounds to attribute the poem A Funerall Elegye to John Ford not William Shakespeare. 4 4. " A Funerall Elegye … Not … By W. S. After All," Studies in Bibliography 54 (2001): 157–172. Another QSUM analysis argues that The Dark Tower, a fantasy novel attributed to C. S. Lewis, was writ- ten by more than one author. 5 5. Kathryn Lindskoog, Sleuthing C. S. Lewis: More Light in the Shadowlands (Macon, Georgia: Mercer Univ. Press, 2001), 262–264. The eminent Fielding scholar Martin C. Battestin strongly endorses the theory: "I have read [ Analysing for Authorship ] in typescript and can say that here, for the first time, the Cusum technique is explained in lucid detail, the objections to it are cogently refuted, and the theory's efficacy in solving particular problems of authorship attribution in literature and law is, in a quite literal sense, graphically demonstrated." Battestin's title for his brief essay cogendy states his belief in the theory's promise: "The Cusum Method: Escaping the Bog of Subjectivism." 6 6. Eighteenth-Century Fiction 8 (1995–96): 533–538. The quotation occurs on page 537. Battestin's essay is part of a forum on attribution prompted by J. Paul Hunter's favorable review of P. N. Furbank and W. R. Owens, Defoe De-Attributions: A Critique of J. R. Moore's "Checklist" in Eighteenth-Century Fiction 8 (1995–96): 310–312. Further contributions by Hunter, Isobel Grundy, Melvyn New, Hugh Amory, Maximillian E. Novak, Carolyn Woodward, Barbara Laning Fitzpatrick, and Furbank and Owens appear in Eighteenth-Century Fiction 8 (1995–96): 519–538; 9 (1996–97): 89–100, 223–225. Since I cite Battestin here, I want to be clear: QSUM does not play any part in his edition of New Essays by Henry Fielding: His Contributions to the Craftsman (1734–1739) and Other Early Journalism (Charlottesville: Univ. Press of Virginia, 1989). That volume contains a "stylometric analysis" by Michael Farringdon, but this analysis differs from QSUM, and so my remarks here do not directly pertain to the conclusions reached in those attributions, which I have not exam- ined in any detail. In Analysing for Authorship, Jill Farringdon promises that "in due course, all forty-one of the New Essays [attributed to Fielding] will be analysed by QSUM, and the results published" (175). I am not aware of any publication along these lines. The theory's proponents thus apply QSUM to a range of genres written in a variety of historical periods, and so QSUM has the potential to be useful to anyone concerned with attribution. It consequently deserves careful attention. What are the underlying theoretical principles of QSUM? The proponents themselves do not know. They believe that certain "language-habits" can distin- guish the utterance (written or spoken) of one person from another. These habits include the frequency of short words (with two, three, or four letters) and of words beginning with a vowel. Sometimes short words and initial-vowel words are used in combination. Why these particular habits serve to distinguish one author from another is unclear. In Analysing for Authorship, Michael Farringdon himself admits that QSUM "works, but no explanation is yet available. It is too early to provide a theoretical scientific reason as to why the technique succeeds" (241). Perhaps he hopes that future developments will offer theoretical support. In the meantime, one can examine QSUM only in practice, which Michael Farringdon wholly en- dorses: "In scientific evidence, what is required is that an experimental method be capable of being replicated by others. When cusum analysis is applied to the data under examination by other practitioners and identical results follow, then the evidence is verified. That is, utterance by one person will, under analysis, yield a consistent graph, and will separate from utterance by other persons. This is all that is required scientifically" (241). In the spirit of this recommendation, I first explain this method using a test case presented by Jill Farringdon, after which I run other tests. She chooses a 31-sentence sample of her own writing, included on pages 26–32 of her book. The sample is entirely by her and therefore the outcome of any accurate QSUM analysis should demonstrate that one person wrote this sample. In the words of QSUM practitioners, the sample should be shown to be "homogeneous" or not a "mixed utterance." Before analyzing the sample text, one must "process" it properly. Among other things, she recommends deleting direct quotations and removing spaces between the words of the same proper name and between words Table 1.

For the following discussion, I choose her own sample, which she presumably processed correctly. The first stage involves count- ing the number of words in each sentence and then tabulating them. Then one determines the average number of words per sentence in the sample. Then one determines for each sentence the deviation from this average. Finally, one calcu- lates a running total (or cumulative sum, hence the name of the theory) of these deviations (abbreviated qsld ). Table 1 may help explain this final calculation more clearly. The qsld for sentence 1 is −10.258, which is then added to the deviation for sentence 2 (−6.258) to determine the qsld for sentence 2 (−16.516). The data in table 1 match Farringdon's data on pages 33 and 55 of her book. I omit the running total of words per sentence (column 2 on page 55) since that information is not necessary for any calculation. Also, I have not rounded off the cumulative sums to the nearest integer as she suggests on page 19 and shows in column 5 on page 55. I see no statistical benefit to rounding to this extent. Here and elsewhere I have rounded numbers to three decimal places. While I recognize that doing so may be excessive, I would note that Farringdon her- self rounds the deviations from averages to three decimal places (column 4 on page 55). The second stage of QSUM analysis involves identifying a "language-habit" that "will remain consistent in the sample of language being tested" (19) and will distinguish the author of the sample from other possible authors. On pages 20 and 25, Farringdon offers eight possible "language-habits" that could be tested by counting the frequency of different kinds of words per sentence: 1. two- and three-letter words 2. words starting with a vowel 3. two- and three-letter words plus words starting with a vowel 4. two-, three-, and four-letter words 5. two-, three-, and four-letter words plus words starting with a vowel 6. three- and four-letter words 7. three- and four-letter words plus words starting with a vowel 8. words other than two- or three-letter words When counting "short" words and words starting with a vowel, one must not "double-dip" or count the same word twice. (The word "and," for example, is a three-letter word that begins with a vowel, but it cannot be counted as two words.) She also states that "the most satisfactory percentage of 'habit' words per sentence is between 45 and 55 per cent" (25). For her own writing, she usually chooses test #3, two- and three-letter words plus words starting with a vowel. For this 31-sentence sample, the average number of these words per sentence is 11.677, which is 52.5% of the average number of total words per sentence and is comfortably within her "satisfactory" range. After counting the words belonging to the selected "language-habit" one then performs cumulative sum calculations similar to the ones conducted for sentence length. Table 2 presents these results. The second column is headed "23lw+ivw," her abbreviation for "two- and three- letter words plus words starting with a vowel." The data in the second column of table 2 match Farringdon's data in the last column on page 33. (She does not provide raw data for the other two columns, but the resulting graph shows that my numbers match hers.) The third and final stage is to graph the two cumulative sums and to super- impose the lines to make a "QSUM-chart." If the lines closely correspond, the sample text is by a single author. If they separate, the sample text results from a mixed utterance. Figure 1 is the QSUM-chart for the 31-sentence sample. The horizontal axis charts the sequence of sentences in order. The left vertical axis charts the cumulative sums of sentence length; the right vertical axis charts the cumulative sums of two- and three-letter and initial-vowel words. Figure 1 matches figure JMF-3 on page 36 of Farringdon's book. This would make sense since both figures derive from the same set of data and use the same method to scale the chart (I discuss scale in more detail later). Thus I have replicated the technique correctly. Farringdon comments on this figure: "What is here visible in the superimposed QSUM-chart is a consistent habit running through a reasonable sample of thirty-one sentences. To the experienced eye, this is a homogeneous chart. The two lines track each other quite smoothly, though some slight displacement appears around sentences 18–20, resulting in what Table 2.

Farringdon explains that the "blip" results from a "high degree of condensed information" (37) in sentences 18–20. I have presented this primer of QSUM for a number of reasons: 1) to show that I understand the mathematics involved; 2) to show that I can accurately replicate the method; and 3) to establish a basis upon which I will analyze further examples more efficiently. First, though, I want to raise central questions about this method. I can think of a number of objections to the QSUM method. The lack of any theoretical justification is troubling, and leaves the skeptical outsider with no way to challenge the proponents on this basis. I suspect that a linguist would be especially dubious, since the "language-habits" used in QSUM do not cor- FIGURE 1. Jill Farringdon's sample. relate to standard linguistic categories. QSUM does not classify words based on function, but rather according to length or whether or not the words begin with vowels. How meaningful is a category (such as test #3 above) that would include "the" and "anaconda" and "apprehend"? Farringdon does not address this issue in any detail, and in her book I find no citations of linguistic research. Indeed, Farringdon cites no independent research to support her assertion that "the use of these unconscious linguistic habits does not change" (84), and she thus fails to engage with the substantial amount of scholarship on intra-speaker variation. 7 7. The following article directly challenges the claim that authors are consistent in their use of these "language-habits": Pieter de Haan and Erik Schils, "The Qsum Plot Exposed," Cre- ating and Using English Language Corpora: Papers from the Fourteenth International Conference on English Language Corpora, Zürich, 1993, ed. Udo Fries, Gunnel Tottie, and Peter Schneider (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1994), 93–105. Farringdon does not cite this article, and to my knowledge the QSUM proponents have not addressed its criticisms. Another major objection is that visual inspection of charts is imprecise. And one wonders why visual inspection is necessary since all of the relevant linguistic information has been quantified. Why not develop a quantitative scheme to com- pare the cumulative sums at every point? The chart, after all, attempts to display the difference (shown vertically) between the cumulative sums. If the differences are small, then the sample text is homogeneous. If the differences are large, then the sample text is a mixed utterance. However, how does one precisely define "small" and "large" in this context? What precisely distinguishes "blips" that suggest anomalies from "separations" that suggest mixed utterance? With a quantitative method and the consequent calculations, one would then need specific criteria that would distinguish a homogeneous utterance from a mixed utterance. If all of these criteria could be expressed numerically, that would help FIGURE 2. Jill Farringdon's sample (modified scale). support QSUM's claims of "objectivity." The proponents of QSUM could have used the "chi-squared goodness-of-fit test" which has a sound statistical basis and is commonly taught in undergraduate statistics courses. It also makes clear what "small" and "large" mean in specific circumstances. Michael Farringdon refers to various statistical measures in Analysing for Authorship (though not chi-squared), but does not delve into them in any significant detail. Furthermore, he concludes that "I have yet to find these [statistical] measures giving a result that differs significantly from that found by visual inspection" (261). 8 8. See page 242 for a similar comment. Since QSUM relies so much on visual inspection of these charts, one needs to recognize a fundamental axiom of charts: scale is important. Changing the scale changes the chart. For example, figure 2 derives from the same data used in figure 1, but with different scales for the vertical axes. In figure 2, the upper limit is 50 and the lower limit is −50 for both vertical axes. Surely, visual inspection of figure 2—whether by the novice or expert QSUM practitioner—reveals significant separation between these two lines. Reducing a scale allows for greater detail to appear, and this is evident in figure 2. Note the blank space in the top and bottom quarters of figure 1; the lines in figure 2 oc- cupy a greater portion of the space used in the chart. Note also that the "blips" Farringdon identified in figure 1 for sentences 18–20 seem relatively minor com- pared to the "big blips" in figure 2 for sentences 12–14. Also, the overlapping lines in figure 1 for sentences 6–11 dramatically separate in figure 2. Why would this be so? Analysing for Authorship is not helpful here, because Farringdon never discusses scale using a chart that contains two lines, and so she does not describe what happens to a QSUM-chart that purportedly shows homogeneous author- ship when one alters the scale even slightly. Her brief discussion of scale sets out rules "in order that graphs or charts may be drawn in a perspective which provides clear information by visual dis- play" (52). She adds that "the objective is that the graph show the line at about one quarter to one third of the vertical range of the sample in proportion to the horizontal space" (52). To determine what she defines as the appropriate scale for the cumulative sum of sentence length, she first determines the maximum and minimum values of this cumulative sum for the sample chosen. In this in- stance, the maximum is 34.806 (for sentence 24 in table 1) and the minimum is −41.581 (for sentence 10). In this instance, adding the absolute values (absolute values ignore the negative and positive signs) of the maximum and minimum gives the range, which in this example is 76.387. Since Farringdon rounds the cumulative sum for sentence length to the nearest integer, she finds a range of 77. The difference is not significant, and so for the purposes of this discussion, I will treat the range as exactly 77. The scale in figure 1 for the cumulative sum of sentence length uses 120 as the upper limit and −120 as the lower limit. The entire range for this vertical axis is thus 240. If we divide 77 by 240 we get .321, which is within Farringdon's preference of between one quarter to one third. In figure 1, Farringdon's vertical axis on the right also yields a proportion of .321, producing almost identical proportions for the scaling of both vertical axes. The altered vertical axes in figure 2 use a range of 100, and the percentages (77/100 = .77 and 46/100 = .46) are outside her preference. Because Farringdon relies solely on a visual impression in relation to the scale, her method of scaling is arbitrary. (It is also imprecise; "about one quarter to one third" allows for enough variation that could significantly affect the ap- pearance of the chart.) The arbitrariness of her scaling method leaves her open to the charge that she is prejudicial toward the presentation of her data, as her method allows her to determine the scale after performing her calculations. What she needs is a scaling method that must be set prior to her calculations. To avoid the charge of being arbitrary (and potentially prejudicial), she could have adopted a standardized scale based on the standard deviation of the cumu- lative sums. To create this standardized scale, one would subtract the mean from each cumulative sum and divide the difference by the standard deviation. Figure 3 displays the same data using a standardized scale. This method requires only one vertical axis for both lines. This method also eliminates the arbitrary nature of her method of scaling. However, the interpretation of the chart based on a standardized scale is open to debate. Does figure 3 reveal that the sample is of homogeneous or mixed utterance? The lines overlap for most of the chart, and the most significant separation occurs between sentences 17 and 21. Is that sepa- ration significant? The separation in figure 3 for those sentences looks greater than that in figure 1, but it is not clear whether the separation in either figure is significant. So there exists a reliable and consistent way to determine scale that Far- ringdon could have used. The use of a standardized scale would have removed any suspicion that she might be manipulating the scale to create charts that skew her data. However, I cannot determine whether or not she manipulates the scale in her book or her recent SB article because she does not offer the raw data that provide the basis for her charts. Had she provided such information she could FIGURE 3. Jill Farringdon's sample (standardized scale). have removed this suspicion. Doing so, however, would not have helped answer the other main objection, namely that the visual inspection of charts invites sub- jective judgments at odds with QSUM's claims of objectivity. As serious as these criticisms are, I would like to set them aside for the mo- ment in order to test QSUM on its own terms. In doing so, I will adhere to Farringdon's guidelines throughout. The QSUM proponents base the method's validity almost exclusively on the claim that it "works." But does it? Testing QSUM For the purposes of testing QSUM I have selected four samples of 31 sen- tences each to determine if the samples are homogeneous or mixed utterance. An expert QSUM practitioner has carefully processed all four samples to elimi- nate anomalies, so I am confident that my counts of word totals are accurate. I have chosen to use the same test employed above, that is, two- and three-letter words plus words starting with a vowel. My reasons for selecting this particu- lar language-habit should become apparent in due course. I identify these four samples as W, X, Y, and Z. For each sample, I present the relevant data in tabular form followed by the QSUM-charts. I adhere to Farringdon's guidelines regard- ing scale for each of them. As a relative newcomer to QSUM, I do not know what to make of fig- ure 4. Significant overlap seems to occur, but separation also occurs near the beginning and ending of the sample. Separation in figures 5 and 6 is much more pronounced, and I am confident that samples X and Y are mixed utter- ances. My confidence increases on this score with sample Z. The two lines in figure 7 criss-cross several times, a feature that Farringdon notes is characteristic of mixed utterance (70, 217). Also, there is only slight overlap at the beginning and end.

It may come as a greater surprise to learn that Jill Far- ringdon is the author of W, X, Y, and Z. Surprise may increase to shock when one discovers that throughout I have been using the original 31-sentence sample for all of these examples. The attentive reader may have noticed that the word totals and averages from W, X, Y, and Z are identical to each other and to the original sam- ple tabulated in tables 1 and 2. All I did was rearrange the sentences in four ways: random rearrangement (W), insertion of sentences 17–30 after sentence 2 (X), rearrangement of sentences in groups of about 5 (Y), and alternation of long and short sentences (Z). Table 7 presents the various rearrangements. One can then cross-check the other tables to verify that the specific word counts and deviations from averages match the correct sentence. One might object that rearrangement violates a fundamental "rule" of QSUM and that therefore my charts are irrelevant to the issue of the method's validity. On the surface, rearranging sentences tampers with the sample text and could alter the meaning of the original, if not reduce it to gibberish. But issues of content and meaning play insignificant roles in the context of QSUM. Ad- ditionally, rearrangement of samples is a recommended practice. For sample X, I performed what Farringdon calls a "sandwich": "A 'sandwich' is a useful test: as its name indicates, it is a procedure whereby a new sample of sentences is inserted into utterance already tested and found to be homogeneous" (305n14). Indeed, she often uses this test. In the case of sample X, I did not insert a "new" sample, but then again, all the sentences here were purported to be "already tested and found to be homogeneous." Sample X produced figure 5, which ac- cording to QSUM clearly indicates mixed utterance—even more so than the random version I call sample W, which produced figure 4. On the issue of ran- dom rearrangement, Farringdon writes: "It has been pointed out by members of an academic audience on different occasions that sentences in various QSUM examples displayed need not be sequential, and that they would produce the same consistency if analysed in random order. This is true" (114). Elsewhere, Far- ringdon recommends alternating short samples: "This can be done by following a small number of sentences (between four to eight) of one author with a similar number of the second author, until your sample is completely used up" (120). I used this method to create sample Y, which produced figure 6. For sample Z, I intended to create a "roller-coaster" effect, such that the alternation of longest and shortest sentences would bounce the lines up and down. Doing so causes definite separation in this instance. How can this be? The answer returns us to the fundamental nature of QSUM which is evident in its name: cumulative sums. Despite Farringdon's assurances to the contrary, sequence order matters greatly when calculating cumulative sums. Table 7 compares the relevant data for any particular sentence generated for the original sample, W, X, Y, and Z. One can quickly tell that no matter how the sentences are rearranged, certain information does not change. The cumulative sums, however, almost always change. Table 8 uses sentence 10 of the original sample and its equivalents as an example. Obviously, the number of words per sentence will not change no matter where that sentence has been rearranged in the sample. Also, the number of types of words (in this case, two- and three-letter words and words beginning with a vowel) will not change. And since the contents of the entire sample have not been altered, the averages will remain the same, and therefore the deviations from those averages will also stay constant. The cumulative sums, however, de- pend on the previous cumulative sums, which depend on the previous cumulative sums, etc. Anyone who has even a basic familiarity with statistics would know that altering the sequence almost always changes the cumulative sums. The im- plications of this fact are devastating for the theory called QSUM. This should already be apparent when comparing figures 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 and recognizing that they display radically different QSUM-charts for the same utterance. Con- trary to Farringdon's assertions, the order of the sequence matters a great deal. Thus one must wonder why the proponents use cumulative sums. I find no theoretical explanation of this approach in Analysing for Authorship beyond a pass- ing reference to the method's origins: "Morton first suggested the idea of cumu- lative sum tests for language as long ago as the 1960s, carrying the idea over from its industrial setting: such tests are widely used in industry as a method of sampling averages" (13). Farringdon is correct on this point; cumulative sums are Table 8.

For example, engineers involved with quality control find this technique useful. 9 9. For a brief discussion of cumulative sums in this context, see Richard A. Johnson, Miller and Freund's Probability and Statistics for Engineers, 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, New Jer- sey: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2005), 525–526. See also the discussion in the Engineering Statistics Handbook of the U. S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, located at this website: &lt;http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section3/pmc323.htm&gt;. Morton, Farringdon, and others thus adapt a reliable statistical technique for purposes that have nothing whatever to do with the technique's original func- tion. That in itself is not a problem, for many statistical techniques find valid uses beyond their original applications. But the uses are valid only when the proponents are using the techniques to measure phenomena that are demonstra- bly analogous. The burden falls on Farringdon and her associates to show that cumulative sum analysis is applicable for determining the authorship of texts. What analogies exist between quality control and the attribution of authorship? Those involved with quality control want to know how change occurs during a particular sequence, and so they would never rearrange the data in the way that I have done (and as recommended by Farringdon). Those involved with attribu- tion want to know how particular linguistic features distinguish one author from another. Such interests in the use of language have nothing to do with sequence or with change, which is presumably why Farringdon believes that "sentences in various QSUM examples displayed need not be sequential" (114). Attribution study—even the branch of attribution study concerned with quantitatively-based theories—does not generally explore the sequence of the sentences. And even if the sequence of the sentences was a topic of interest, one would have to expect that the text's final sequence would often differ greatly from the sequence of earlier versions; most authors cut and paste. By rearranging sets of sentences in the way that Farringdon has done, she has misused the technique of cumulative sums and has applied it for purposes that have nothing to do with the original technique. In addition, cumulative sums as used in quality control measure one variable. As far as I can tell, cumulative sum charts never compare multiple variables. In this context, it is worth pointing out that in Analysing for Authorship, the Far- ringdons favorably refer to the work of A. F. Bissell, who has published on the use of cumulative sum charts for various industrial applications. In the article that Michael Farringdon cites, Bissell includes three cumulative sum charts, all of which contain only one variable each. 10 10. For references to Bissell, see pages xii, 243, 258–259, and 315n20. In the final refer- ence, Michael Farringdon cites the following article: A. F. Bissell, "Weighted Cusums—Method and Applications," Total Quality Management 1.3 (1990): 391–402. In Morton's earlier work, he presented cumulative sum charts that contain only one variable: Literary Detection: How to Prove Authorship and Fraud in Literature and Documents (New York: Scribner's, 1978), 78, 81, 84, 85, and 170. If I am correct that these charts never compare multiple variables—and this issue is never addressed in Analysing for Authorship —then Morton and Farringdon have drastically altered and mishan- dled a valid statistical technique. What are possible objections to these criticisms? Every one that I can think of would apply equally to the QSUM proponents. My sample text was processed by Jill Farringdon herself. The sample was examined using the "language-habit" test that she identified as reliably distinguishing her utterance from that of oth- ers. The methods of combining different sets of sample texts are based on Far- ringdon's guidelines. The formulas for scaling each vertical axis are also based on her guidelines. Nonetheless, the four charts for samples W, X, Y, and Z dramati- cally differ from the one Farringdon presents, even though all the charts derive from the same raw data. Using the techniques outlined here, anyone could re- peat this falsification process for almost any set of data provided by QSUM proponents. Perhaps the only objection available to the QSUM proponents is that I did not use the transparency method that Farringdon recommends as preferable to the charts: "the more sensitive way to compare the sentence-length and habit is to print out separate graphs for each, and to compare the movement of the sentence and habit deviations by the use of transparencies. Indeed, this method is essential for any serious project, and is the proper method for isolating either single-sentence anomalies or aberrant interpolations of passages which typically constitute mixed utterance" (35). The transparency method, however, is more subjective than the charts. With the charts, different examiners can at least agree on the visual data being displayed; transparencies would add ambiguity and raise questions about how one should manipulate the graphs. How does one overlay one graph upon another? Are the initial points and/or the terminal points se- lected as fixed positions of reference? Doing so will probably result in something nearly identical to the QSUM-charts presented here and in Farringdon's book. Can one adjust the superimposed graphs in any way? Farringdon does not say, and her language on this crucial point is remarkably vague. Elsewhere Farringdon writes that once one has these separate graphs on transparencies one then needs "to see whether the two graph-lines track each other closely, or even coincide." 11 11. This quotation comes from her SB article, pages 164–165. What exactly does "track" mean? Again, Farringdon does not clarify this term, as if its meaning were obvious. One in- terpretation could be that the lines track each other when they have a similar shape, though this too is vague. But this general issue should return us to the fundamental matter of exactly what linguistic information QSUM purports to analyze. Since these charts display cumulative sums, the line will move upward when above average information is displayed, and downward when below aver- age information is displayed. Or, to take the example of sentence length (qsld), the line will move upward for a longer than average sentence and downward for a shorter than average sentence. (This average is determined by the sample under examination.) This principle also holds for the line representing the language- habit being used. If one is measuring the number of two- and three-letter and initial-vowel words, then the line moves upward or downward depending on the deviation from the average number of this class of words per sentence (again, with the average determined by the sample being studied). So when these two lines "track" or follow the same shape, they tend to move up and down at the same points and with similar slopes. If one ignores the issue of whether or not the lines coincide at any particular point, one can see that for figures 1–7, the two lines of each chart follow similar shapes. In every example that Farringdon presents, the two lines of each chart follow similar shapes as well—regardless of whether or not the chart purports to establish homogenous or mixed utterance. These lines "track" each other quite well because of an obvious linguistic fact: since longer sentences, by definition, have more words (relative to some baseline of measurement), they will tend to have more words of a particular class. And of course a similar principle holds for shorter sentences. The degree of this tendency can vary, but will generally hold true. If one can move the transparencies when overlaying them, then one could show that the lines "track" in almost every instance. In conclusion, QSUM uses vague definitions for its terms, misuses a valid statistical technique, and relies on visual inspection without employing a stan- dardized method for calculating scale. Finally, it does not, in any sense of the word, "work." QSUM has no validity. But since an invalid method may well reach true conclusions, I offer no judgment on the attributions or de-attributions that Farringdon presents. Readers should not conclude from my discussion that, for example, D. H. Lawrence did indeed write the short story "The Back Road." Rather, they should recognize that QSUM does not offer any valid judgment on this attribution or on any other. This method is so faulty that one can manipulate it to claim any position on any particular attribution. 12 12. The following article presents a critical assessment of the QSUM approach proposed by A. Q. Morton and S. Michaelson: Michael L. Hilton and David I. Holmes, "An Assess- ment of Cumulative Sum Charts for Authorship Attribution," Literary and Linguistic Computing 8 (1993): 73–80. The authors offer cogent criticism, but do not attempt to falsify the technique in the way that I do. Alternatives to Cumulative Sums Farringdon asserts but does not prove that her "language-habits" help to distinguish one author from another. As I have already suggested, the assump- tions behind her method may not have a reliable linguistic basis. But how can we know? One could test the hypothesis that Farringdon's "language-habits" FIGURE 8. Jill Farringdon's sample as scatterplot. help distinguish homogeneous from mixed utterance, and one could use reliable statistical techniques to do so that have nothing to do with cumulative sums. Farringdon wants to explore the relationship between two variables: the num- ber of total words per sentence and the number of words in a particular class per sentence. To display this relationship, one would not use cumulative sum charts (which are not used to display the relationship between two variables), but a scat- terplot. The scatterplot would use the horizontal axis for total number of words per sentence, and the vertical axis for number of words in a particular class per sentence. For the following example, I will use the same class that I have used throughout, namely two- and three-letter plus initial-vowel words. Each point on the scatterplot represents the data for a single sentence. The scatterplot also helps to avoid the problem of sequence that plagues QSUM, since the rearrangement of sentences in the sample will not change the appearance of the scatterplot. Figure 8 is a scatterplot for Farringdon's 31-sentence sample. One can immediately tell certain things about the relationship between the two variables. First, one can see that longer sentences tend to have more two- and three-letter plus initial-vowel words. (As I have already shown, this is not in any way a surprise.) Statisticians would call this a positive association. The relation- ship also seems to be linear, since the points tend to cluster around an imaginary line. Statisticians would also state that this relationship seems to be particularly strong, since the points lie relatively close to this line with little "scatter." Since the relationship appears linear, we could draw a line through these points. Obviously, we would like to draw the best possible line, and the "least- squares regression line" meets this demand in the sense of minimizing the error in predicting the number of two- and three-letter and initial-vowel words. Figure 9 adds the regression line to the scatterplot in figure 8. A commonly used quan- titative measurement of how well the line fits the points in the scatterplot is the FIGURE 9. Jill Farringdon's sample as scatterplot (with regression line added). "correlation coefficient," designated by r. 13 13. For further discussion of the "least-squares regression line" and the "correlation coefficient," see David S. Moore, The Basic Practice of Statistics (New York: W. H. Freeman, 1995), 111–128. One can calculate the value of r in Microsoft Excel by using the CORREL function. r is always between −1 and 1, with r close to either −1 or 1 indicating a strong association (correlation), and r close to 0 indicating a lack of association. Squaring the correlation coefficient ( r 2 ) gives the portion of variation in the vertical axis that is explained by the horizontal axis. In this instance, r 2 is .905. That means that 90.5% of the variation we see in the number of two- and three-letter plus initial-vowel words is explained by the number of words in the sentence. I had already noted this high degree of correlation from the visual inspection of this scatterplot; r 2 provides us with a precise measurement of that correlation. So for this sample, the relationship between the two variables that Farringdon wants to measure is highly predictable. And because it is so predictable, it does not seem to measure anything that would assist one in trying to distinguish one author from another. This high degree of predictability means that at most 9.5% of the two- and three-letter plus initial-vowel words in this sample can be ex- plained by something related to Farringdon's so-called "linguistic fingerprint" that distinguishes her writing from that of another. Is this sample representative? The only way to answer that question would be to take many samples from various writers, count the relevant words, and calculate the values of r 2 . I did this for three other samples by canonical writers from different time periods. I selected samples of 31 sentences each from the beginnings of these very different works: Samuel Johnson's The Rambler no. 14 (1750), Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre (1847), and Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse Table 9. Sample texts by other authors Author Average Words per Sentence ± Standard Deviation Average 23lw+ivw per Sentence ± Standard Deviation Ratio of 23lw+ivw to Total Number of Words per Sentence (slope of regression line) r 2 Johnson 49.6 ± 19.1 27.9 ± 11.8 .58 .889 Brontë 31.1 ± 23.2 15.4 ± 12.6 .54 .972 Woolf 37.9 ± 38.0 19.1 ± 19.4 .51 .985 Johnson, Brontë, Woolf, and Farringdon combined (124 sentences total) 35.2 ± 26.5 18.5 ± 14.5 .54 .959 (1927). 14 14. I used the following authoritative editions for these works: Volume 3 of The Yale Edition of the Works of Samuel Johnson, ed. W. J. Bate and Albrecht B. Strauss (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1969), 74–79; Jane Eyre: The Clarendon Edition of the Novels of the Brontës, ed. Jane Jack and Margaret Smith (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969), 3–6; and To the Lighthouse: The Definitive Col- lected Edition of the Novels of Virginia Woolf (London: Hogarth Press, 1990), 3–6. I did not count the abbreviations "Mr." and "Mrs." as two and three letter words. For the Jane Eyre sample, I omitted the four lines of verse on page 4 because I wanted to examine only prose. Table 9 presents the compiled data for the samples from these three works along with a combined dataset that contains all 124 sentences from John- son, Brontë, Woolf, and Farringdon. The high values for r 2 show that the primary and almost exclusive factor in determining the number of two- and three-letter plus initial-vowel words is the length of the sentence itself. In order to substantiate this point more fully, one would have to draw on many more samples. But the evidence I present here is quite suggestive. These three writers from three different centuries have very dif- ferent styles, as suggested by the very different average lengths of their sentences. Despite that important difference, the similar values of r 2 show that for each of these three samples, the correlations between the two measured variables are extremely strong. The combined sample of sentences from Johnson, Brontë, Woolf, and Far- ringdon is even more suggestive. The value of r 2 is again quite high. If one were to remove sentences by Johnson from this combined sample, the strength of the correlation would not significantly change. The average sentence length would change, since of these four writers, Johnson's average sentence length is the greatest. (Any casual reader of Johnson's essays knows that his sentences tend to be relatively long.) However, the "language-habit" under discussion does not refer to sentence length by itself, but to the relationship between sentence length and two- and three-letter plus initial-vowel words. The information in table 9 suggests that that relationship (as measured by r 2 ) will not vary significantly no matter how many sentences are removed from the combined sample and re- gardless of the authorship of those sentences. At least for these samples, this "language-habit" fails to distinguish these authors from one another, and a quantitatively-based attribution method that fails to distinguish between the writ- ings of Samuel Johnson, Charlotte Brontë, Virginia Woolf, and Jill Farringdon is of no value. Based on this admittedly limited amount of evidence, I would hypothesize that the relationship between sentence length and the number of two- and three- letter plus initial-vowel words is highly predictable, and perhaps universally so for non-technical writing in the English language in the modern period. That hypothesis is supported by the remarkably similar ratios between this category of words and the total number of words for all these samples. If my hypothesis is correct, then the relationship is so predictable that it does not provide a useful basis for discriminating between one author and another. To test that hypoth- esis, one could examine far more examples than I have to determine whether or not the r 2 values tend to be .889 or higher. The QSUM proponents have accumulated an enormous amount of this data, and they could easily perform the necessary calculations. Doing so is necessary to defend the view that this "language-habit" is indeed an individual, unconscious habit, and not a general fact of language. Some Modest Proposals As I have already suggested, any quantitative attribution method that purports to be valid must define terms precisely and use statistical concepts in an appropri- ate manner. It should also offer a theoretical justification. But such conditions are not sufficient. Proponents of quantitative methods must also rigorously attempt to falsify their theories. At the hypothetical stage of testing, the question should not be "does it work?" but rather "does it resist all reasonable attempts to make it fail?" And so I raise these final points not in relation to QSUM—which can- not be rescued—but in regard to other quantitative approaches that have been offered and will likely continue to be offered. 15 15. For a useful survey of other quantitative approaches and a judicious assessment of the potential pitfalls and rewards of this burgeoning subfield, see Harold Love, Attributing Author- ship, 132–162. One simple falsification test would work as follows. Take the original textual data set of homogeneous writing, omit a portion from that data set (perhaps an entire work), then test the omitted portion against the remaining data set. Repeat this test using a different omitted portion and repeat again and again until every portion of the data set has been tested. Since this description might be confusing, I offer this concrete example. Start with the complete plays of Shakespeare, exclud- ing those plays believed to have been written in collaboration. Process these plays as necessary, and then remove Romeo and Juliet from this data set. Now test Romeo and Juliet against the data set of fully Shakespearean plays (excluding Romeo and Ju- liet ). Does the method correctly identify Romeo and Juliet as Shakespeare's? Re-insert Romeo and Juliet back into the data set, and remove a different play to test. Does the method work for this play? If, after frequent attempts, the method never fails, then one has a plausible hypothesis worth examining. This falsification test has the added benefit of determining whether or not a particular method can fail to distin- guish between works by the same author that employ radically different styles. But before going further, one should allow others to verify these falsification attempts and possibly run further tests. The best way to do this, it seems to me, would be to make available the raw texts as well as the data and formulas on a publicly accessible website. Then others could download the tests and examine the information for themselves. Proponents of these kinds of methods should also provide their history of failed attempts. There is no shame in conceiving a method and then finding out on one's own that it does not work. A description of the process of trial and er- ror should actually increase the reader's confidence in the author's drive to find a reliable, objective method. All methods have limitations, and proponents of attribution methods should acknowledge and describe those limitations. For example: "I have successfully tested this method on journalistic prose during the first half of the eighteenth century, but have found it to be less reliable for poetry or verse drama." Genre and time period are obvious limitations, but there are undoubtedly others. Pro- ponents should go further by describing the size of the samples tested. More importandy, what are the measurements of reliability? Is this a claim of 99% or 95% certainty? One benefit of the chi-squared test I mentioned earlier is that it can calculate its degree of certainty with precision. Each method should include a statement of standards for treatment of orthog- raphy (were texts modernized in any way? were spellings standardized?) as well as attention to bibliographical matters (which editions were used and why?). 16 16. For a thorough discussion of these and related concerns, see Joseph Rudman, "Un- editing, De-Editing, and Editing in Non-traditional Authorship Attribution Studies: With an Emphasis on the Canon of Daniel Defoe," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 99 (2005): 5–36. Proponents of attribution methods must also distinguish between those that reliably disprove authorship versus those that assert it. One can easily imagine a method that can show that a particular author did not write a particular work, but cannot show with any degree of certainty that a different author did write the work. Finally, I would make a plea that proponents separate their arguments in support of the method from its application in particular cases. That is, propo- nents should first independendy publish an account that describes the method and its limitations as well as how it responds to known and accepted cases of authorship. This step should give the scholarly community an opportunity to examine the method and respond. Only after a reasonable time to allow for this exchange should proponents begin to offer attributions (or de-attributions) of particular examples. I hope that this delay would decrease irresponsible claims of authorship. "TELLING IT UNABRIDGED": GRAHAM SWIFT'S REVISION OF WATERLAND by David Leon Higdon and Russell (Rusty) Reed In early 1983, England's William Heinemann and America's Poseidon Press, a hardback division of Simon and Schuster, introduced their readers to Gra- ham Swift's Waterland, a novel reviewed so positively and read so enthusiastically that it quickly began to appear on reading lists, to become central to discussions of postmodernism, and to be recognized, along with D. M. Thomas's The White Hotel (1981) and Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children (1981), as one of the most important British novels of its decade. 1 1. It is, of course, impossible to make an absolute assertion, but these three novels have generated more published discussion than most other novels of the 1980s. The Modem Language International Bibliography reports that as of 29 May 2008 Midnight's Children has been the subject of 223 published essays (a high number that might be expected given its political and colonialist themes), The White Hotel of 59, and Waterland of 49. General discussions of contemporary fiction such as Allan Massie's The Novel Today and Malcolm Bradbury's The Mod- ern British Novel have singled it out for considerable praise. Massie called it "a masterly and intricate narrative" that is "profoundly and unmistakably English" and concluded that Swift "is undoubtedly one of the writers … [who] it may be asserted with real confidence … will play a large part in the future of the Eng- lish novel." 2 2. The Novel Today (London and New York: Longman, 1990), p. 63. Bradbury, discerning that Swift always writes about "an aftermath," praised Waterland 's "fascination with fiction as history, history as fiction, that has been important in the novel certainly since the Sixties." 3 3. The Modern British Novel (London: Penguin, 1993), p. 433. Taking the novel as a crucial example of the new historiographic metafiction, Linda Hutcheon viewed its protagonist as "in some ways an allegorical representative of the postmodern historian who might well have read, not just [R. G.] Collingwood, with his view of the historian as storyteller and detective, but also Hayden White, Dominick LaCapra, Raymond Williams, Michel Foucault, and Jean-François Lyotard." 4 4. The Politics of Postmodernism. (London and New York: Routledge, 1989), p. 56. The titles of the significant works by these authors indicate the general thrust of Hutcheon's comment: The Idea of History (1951) and Essays in the Philosophy of History (1965) by Robin George Collingwood, The Archaeology of Knowledge (1972) by Michel Foucault, Modem European Intellectual History: Reap- praisals (1982) and New Perspectives and Soundings in Critical Theory (1989) by Dominick LaCapra, Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe (1973) and Tropics of Discourse: Essays in Cultural Criticism (1976) by Hayden V. White, Culture and Society, 1780–1950 (1958) by Raymond Williams, and La Condition postmoderne (1979) and La Postmoderne expliqué aux enfants (1988) by Jean-François Lyotard. Since 1992, however, discussions, interpretations, and generalizations about this novel's literary worth and its significance to literary movements have often been using a text of Waterland that differs significandy from the one used by the earlier reviewers, historians, and theoreticians, because while reading proofs for the second British edition Swift was tempted into making numerous revisions, unguided by any articulated plan. The currendy available text differs substan- tively in approximately four hundred and fifty instances from the first edition in ways that reflect its author's concern for vocabulary and syntax but that diminish key features of its narrator-protagonist. In a complicated manner, each word of this retrospective novel has a dual origin in its author and in its character, and as such, these revisions subdy readjust the psychological identity of the narra- tor. There is a quantitative difference between revising the text of a first-person novel and that of an omnisciendy narrated novel. Revision of the latter may be only stylistic in range without significandy affecting character or theme or may completely refocus theme without readjusting a reader's perception of character. In a first-person narration, however, revision of any word, or any sentence, may have an immediate impact on a reader's understanding of and interpretation of the dual narrator/protagonist beyond the author's stylistic concerns. Authorial revisions thus may have a double-layered effect. In the context of Swift's seven other novels, one can see that Swift's revisions in Waterland move in the direction of his later style and strategy where his narrators are less psychologically complex and often less interesting than in his first three novels. After summarizing critical responses to The Light of Day, Swift's most recent novel, David Malcolm agrees with D. J. Taylor that "[c]hief among The Light of Day's characteristics is its oddly desiccated feel—material stretched beyond its natural limit, characters reduced to a rudimentary minimum, prose pruned savagely back." 5 5. Quoted in Understanding Graham Swift (Columbia: Univ. of South Carolina Press, 2003), p. 188. Taylor's review, "South London Reveries," appeared in Times Literary Supplement, 28 February 2003, 21–22. As with the first editions of Swift's earlier novels, The Sweet-Shop Owner (1980) and Shuttlecock (1981), the first British and first American printings of Waterland are identical. Following the enactment of the 1892 Chace Act, which stipulated that any foreign book to secure American copyright had to be reset by American compositors, English and American editions of a novel could best be described as "brothers," because of numerous potentials for textual differences. 6 6. These potentials include house-styling, censorship, editorial intervention, etc. At present, however, English and American "editions" more resemble identical twins who assert their individuality through dressing differently. Thus, the English (Heine- mann) and American (Poseidon) "editions" have different dust jackets, different bindings, and different papers, but their texts are identical, and the presence of four identical errors makes it highly likely that Poseidon worked from copy (probably some form of plates or tapes leased from Heinemann, as Washington Square Press later did with Allen Lane in 1985 for Swift's first two novels), reset- ting only the front matter so as to reverse the order of title and author's name. 7 7. Although Waterland has been published in numerous editions and printings, there are essentially two versions in English. The first is represented by the 310-page text issued by Heine- mann (1983), Poseidon (1983), and Picador (1984) and also published with different pagination by Olivers Press (1984,418 pp., large-print), Washington Square Pocket Books (1985, 270 pp.), and Heinemann New Windmills (1991, 334 pp.). The second version has appeared as 358-page volumes from Picador (1992) and Vintage International (1992). In this essay, the base texts are indicated as P (1983 Poseidon) and V (1992 Vintage), with occasional references to H (Heine- mann 1983). Swift has the notes, manuscript, typescript, and proofs in his possession. These are not available for study at present. The printings' 310 pages mirror one another exactly from the illustration of an eel before the Contents page to the preservation of certain errors, such as "1864" (P78.36; for "1846" V91.14), "kid's" (P204.09; for "kids'" V236.10), and "bucket" (P260.16; for "blanket" V301.11), the latter being uniquely peculiar in that Martha Clay, the novel's "witch," is first quite awkwardly described as "[w]earing a heavy grey skirt that might have been made from a horse bucket." Only one other important variant seems to distinguish the two impressions: in describing Dick Crick's secretive handling of the key to his attic chest, the British printing reads, "Which he hid" (H245.27), whereas the American one nonsensi- cally reads "Which he did" (P245.27), suggesting that Heinemann caught and corrected at least one error after delivering the plates or computerized text to Poseidon. These four errors would not be fully corrected until the Heinemann New Windmill printing (1991). In April 1985, Washington Square Press, a paperback division of Simon and Schuster's Pocket Books, reissued Waterland, using the photograph from the Poseidon dust jacket for its cover but substituting a new back cover. Poseidon had used British blurbs from Publisher's Weekly, Times Literary Supplement, and London Observer; Washington Square substituted American blurbs from the New York Review of Books, Washington Post Book World, Los Angeles Times, and Newsweek and added a further ten before the title page. 8 8. The early reviews emphasized Swift's handling of setting and topic. Publisher's Weekly wrote that he "is to eastern England what William Faulkner is to the South," and The London Observer said that " Waterland appropriates the Fens as Moby Dick did whaling or Wuthering Heights the moor." The American reviews used on the Washington Square paperback spoke more to style and content. Newsweek praised its "prose, for its resonance and clarity," and Michael Wood, writing for the New York Review of Books, called the novel "a formidably intelligent book … animated by an impressive, angry pity at what human creatures are capable of doing to one another in the name of love and need." The perception of the audience shifted considerably in the American marketing strategies. Using such quotations from reviews to help advertise a novel and placing them before the title page has become an increasingly common feature of American paperbacks. The press also reformatted and redesigned the novel in the interests of paperback economy: it reduced the text from 310 to 270 pages (increasing the number of lines per page from thirty-nine to forty-five), relined and centered long chapter titles, capitalized all letters in the first line of each chapter, placed design dots before and after chapter numbers, and capitalized "My" in the titles to chapters 19 (p. 118) and 46 (p. 240). The Washington Square paperback also corrected three of the four errors in its parent edition mentioned above, but failed to change "kid's" (178.14). This edition, in several reprints, monopolized the market in the United States from April 1985 until paperback rights were acquired by another publisher seven years later. By the early 1990s, Swift had changed publishers several times and had moved to Picador, a Macmillan General Books imprint. Perhaps spurred on by the release of the Stephen Gyllenhall film adaptation of the novel 9 9. The Gyllenhall film, starring Jeremy Irons, Ethan Hawke, Sinead Cusack, and Grant Warnock, among others, was neither an artistic nor a commercial success. The novel's 1980s London scenes were inexplicably moved to 1970s Pittsburgh; the scenes in the past were handled as fantasy flashbacks that could be visited in a double-decker bus; Mary Crick is never arrested; etc. The film was released in 1992 by Fine Line Features. Perhaps it was unfamiliarity with the Swift novel that led reviewers to complain about the character Price. Peter Ranier commented that "one of Tom's hectoring classmates [Price is, of course, a student in Tom's class, not his classmate], played by Ethan Hawke, seems to be in the movie to court teen audi- ences; his wise-guy posturings are enough to make you want to brain him" (Los Angeles Times, 6 November 1992, p. F8). Hawke, though, accurately captures the essence of Swift's character. as much as by the celebration of its new author, Picador decided to issue an entirely new edition of Waterland in hardback, reset its text, and sent proofs to Swift. Swift originally had no intention of doing anything other than reading and correcting these proofs; however, the proofs presented "a beguiling opportunity," and he was "seduced by this opportunity" to begin revising his novel, 10 10. Swift, interview with David Leon Higdon (London), 11 July 1996. After the formal in- terview at the Macmillan offices was concluded, Swift and Higdon continued talking informally about the revisions to Waterland, the possibility of Swift writing a circadian or one-day novel (which Swift did do in The Light of the Day [2003]), and the ending of Waterland. Higdon asked Swift why he had concluded Waterland with the image of Dick's motorcycle, a scene that has puzzled many readers and critics, and Swift replied, "Why not?" slightly at first, but then with increasing attention to details in later chapters. He felt then and continues to feel now that the revisions affected neither structure, characteriza- tion, theme, nor the overall impact of individual scenes significandy—readers, however, may disagree. By the time Swift completed his marking of the proofs, all but seven of the novel's fifty-two chapters had experienced some revision, with ten of the chapters accounting for about sixty percent of the revisions and with almost half of the revisions involving deletions of one kind or another. Looking at the revisions chapter by chapter, one sees a cautious reluctance in the rather trivial changes made in the first eight chapters (only 24 revisions in 63 pages) re- placed by a growing acceptance of various kinds of changes in the ninth chapter (49 revisions in 43 pages) made possible through revision and deletion and later applied to the rest of the novel. In all, Swift made 205 deletions, 211 revisions and/or corrections, and 32 additions. Textual theory and textual criticism once proceeded under the assumption that an author consciously intends to improve his or her text when undertaking revisions which are self-motivated, but evidence has demonstrated that such revisions often weaken the text. The revisions in Swift's novel sharply confirm this assumption, because a number of the revisions seem to occlude key scenes and key moments in the text, but more because of the almost accidental, unplanned occasion of the revisions. At some point in 1991, Random House acquired American paperback rights from Picador, and in April 1992 issued Waterland in its Vintage International series—a prestigious series of quality paperbacks that includes works by such authors as William Faulkner and Vladimir Nabokov, Maxine Hong Kingston and A. S. Byatt, E. M. Forster and Thomas Mann. Inclusion of a novel within this series is a virtual imprimatur of its aesthetic worth and cultural significance. (At this same time, Vintage International also acquired the rights to the other four novels Swift had published to date and issued Shuttlecock in 1992 with The Sweet-Shop Owner, Out of This World, and Ever After following in 1993.) For this edition, Marc J. Cohen and Susan Mitchell designed a handsome, expression- istic cover, quite different from the realistic, sepia-toned photograph used by Poseidon and Washington Square. Vintage reprinted the Picador text that had expanded the text to 358 pages, used a thirty-seven line page, italicized all chap- ter titles, dropped the eel illustration, and provided a new photograph of the author as a frontispiece. 11 11. The Vintage printing introduced one new error into the text: "what's in it" (P199.36) appears as "what in it" (V231.12). Because of Waterland's brilliantly successful fusion of content, form, and voice, one needs to understand these relationships to sense the intention, direction, and effect of the revisions. 12 12.

Waterland is the story of Tom Crick, a fifty-three year old history teacher at a coed London prep school, who, within a few months in late 1979 and early 1980, has experienced two of the most stressful events one can undergo: he has lost his wife—to insanity and the asylum—Sand his job—to a reform-minded headmaster. Mary Crick has claimed that God told her to kidnap a baby from its pram outside a Lewisham Safeway as an earned replacement for the baby she aborted in 1943; Lewis Scott, Tom's longtime colleague and rival, has declared history of no "practical relevance to today's real world" (P19.8, V22.17) and banished it from the school's curriculum. Thus simultaneously "wid- owed" from marriage, job, and discipline, Tom is alone in his world. Standing in the classroom before seventeen restive, unruly teenage students for his last term, Tom discards his planned syllabus on the French Revolution and asks the stu- dents to recognize their own placement within history by telling them his family's and his own history. This is no easy task, because Tom must ultimately confess his "responsibility, jointly with [his] wife, for the death of three people" (P272.06, V314.23). The novel, though, is no routine assaying of an unreliable first-person narrator shaken by life and jarred into a moment of wrenching epiphany. Tom is fully reliable; however, he is also fully reluctant. His many sentences trailing into ellipses, discontinuities, free associations, and frequent digressions emphati- cally frame the full expression of his personality as he moves ever closer to full confession yet continually veers into evasive asides on the history of the Fens, the sex life of the eel, the paradoxes of the French Revolution, or the generations of the Atkinson family. Any revision, thus, affects the fabric of his personality and his complexly motivated narrative act, which, at first, alternates chapters in an orderly way between the past and the present—a dialogic rhythm characteristic of all eight of Swift's novels and one that seems generated instinctively during composition since Swift does not work with outlines or chapter plans but rather "just seems" to know when to shift focus from past to present or from present to past. 13 13. Swift, interview with Higdon. Deletions particularly affect the narrator's stance and tone. In the 1983 edition, Tom repeatedly addresses his students as "children": feeling that this word was a bit too patronizing and condescending—considering the age of the students—even for a teacher with thirty-two years of experience behind him, Swift deleted "children" forty-four times. Indeed, eleven of the twenty-four revi- sions in the first eight chapters involve the simple deletion of "children." He struck "ah," one of Tom's favorite interjections, fourteen times, so that a reading such as "Ah, children, consider that" (P169.03) becomes simply and more commandingly, "Consider that" (V194.28). "Children" remains appropriate though, because Tom has come to regard his students as his "children" and finally annexes one of them as his "son." Swift also deleted Price's name several times in passages in which Tom directly addresses this cynical teenager who has most dangerously and most immediately questioned the worth of history in general and the validity of Tom's subscription to a cyclical theory in particular. Tom's tone thus becomes slightly more imperative, his attitude a bit more desperate, through these changes. Indeed, these deletions strike some of Tom's most peculiarly Dickensian tag locutions. In addition, older constructions and obscure words, quite in keeping with Tom's historical bent and pedantic edge, disappear: "be-ribboned" (P78.18), "be- crinolined" (P76.18), "apothegmatic" (P140.39), "awooing" (P221.01), and "per- orate" (P267.27) became "ribboned" (V88.21, though it remained "be-ribboned" at V72.12), "crinolined" (V88.21), "epigrammatic" (V161.32), "wooing" (V255.33), and "declaim" (V309.24). Also, to similar effect, "belvedere" (P112.28) became "hill-crest" (V129.21); "slap-up" (P107.17, V123.22) disappeared; and "gammy" (P214.10) changed to "game" (V248.04). Tom's knowledge of techni- cal terms seems to lessen here, though at times the revisions are problematic. "A two-bench" (P305.24) in the phrase "a two-bench rowing-boat bobs on the high water" changed to "a two-thwart" (V352.31), and "to the after-bench" (P305.34) changes to "towards the stern" (V353.05). A "bench" is the seat in the back of a boat, whereas a "thwart" is a "transverse seat in a boat for rowers to sit on." 14 14. C. W. T. Layton, Dictionary of Nautical Words and Terms (London: Brown, Son and Ferguson, 1955), pp. 42, 371. By replacing "two-bench" with "thwart," Swift turned to the more exact nautical term, one likely to be unfamiliar to a reader, but very familiar to a man raised in the watery Fens. Swift also struck one of Tom's most pedantically digressive pa- rentheses, leaving the passage's focus more on the human than on the etymology. In telling of Dick Crick's death, Tom calls him "barmy," and then adds silently, "(From the Old English "beorm", children, meaning the froth on fermenting beer)" (P304.15, V351.20). Swift cut this sentence, leaving Tom's contempla- tion firmly on his half-brother's suicide. Earlier he extensively revised a similar "lecture" when he changed "Pike. Jack, luce, Esox lucius: Pike. They're killers. Mere-monsters. Freshwater-wolves. The teeth rake backwards towards the gullet, so what goes in, can't—They'll tackle coots, water-voles, other pike. Killers. It's in their nature" (P273.18) to read "But they're killers. Pike. Freshwater-wolves. They'll tackle ducks, water rats, other pike. The teeth rake backwards towards the gullet, so what goes in, can't—Killers" (V316.09). Perhaps the most striking effect brought about by deletions renders Tom Crick less introspective and oddly less historically oriented in his own thoughts. He loses some depth to his interior being—several times, we think most readers will see—to damaging effect, especially since most of his key confession disap- pears. Since every word of the novel is spoken, thought, or remembered by Tom, no revision leaves his character untouched, and each is potentially significant. In the second half of the novel in particular, Tom loses much of his admiration for Victorian and Edwardian energy and optimism, and throughout the novel, he loses considerable certainty about the shapes of history. In Chapter 46, Tom's challenge to his students and to his audience reads: "the world is madder, mad- der than you'd ever think. Discover it for yourselves …" (P276.24). Swift re- vised this to a more general statement of principle: "the world is madder than you'd ever think" (V319.22). In addition, Tom's tendency to situate all references within larger historical events often gets struck, as can be seen in the following deletions. pride? How often does the Gildsey Examiner (founded with Atkinson money and an organ for Disraeliite Toryism) refer in its columns, in the same breath and the same tone, to the March of Industry and the Might of Albion? (P80.23, V93.08) chance (the Gallipoli campaign had just begun) to raise (P187.28, V217.09) treaties, civil war rages in Russia and a thirty-nine-year-old Mussolini is about to seize power in Italy, Henry Crick (P199.18, V230.31) "Nov. 1918": that's before I was—Yet it is as it was, was as it is. Iswas. It's the past! What stops but remains. Mummy, Mummy, tell me a—(P273.12, V316.04) areas, emergency zones and long, long vistas in which nothing happens—save school- mastering and age-concern. So you, after all—a history teacher—afraid to tread, when it comes to it, the mine- fields of the past— (No, no, not afraid—no, I've told it all, told it all unabridged—to my class. No explo- sions yet-unless Price …) (P285.28, V330.09) In addition to stripping away his consciousness of historical contexts, these and similar deletions began to discard Tom's hopes for progress, as when his thoughts, such as "Why has the spread of merriment been transformed into the Idea of Progress? And why has land reclamation in the eastern Fens become confused with the Empire of Great Britain? Because to fix the zenith is to fix the point at which decline begins" (P80.34, V93.16), simply disappear. Tom is a particularly complex character. He is simultaneously seeking for- giveness and escape from his past, yet he is also striving to demonstrate that history has not become irrelevant or obsolete in the twentieth century. Thus he has essentially four loyalties to honor as he tells his tale: loyalties to Mary (his wife), to Dick (his dead brother), to his class, and to himself. The class poses a particular problem in that it is the potential bridge to the future, and he soon finds himself talking to Price alone, the one student he thinks he might sway. In all editions, Tom's classes are contentious sessions, but the class's discomfort and Tom's initial hostility to Price become muted through deletions for the 1992 Picador and Vintage International text. The classroom atmosphere becomes a less noticeably hostile stage for the debate over history. Tom no longer intu- its "[s]uppressed chortlings around the class" (P122.03, V140.11) nor thinks his students perceive him as being "old dry-bones, set-in-his-ways Head of the His- tory Department" (P168.09, V193.20). Nor is his own hostility toward them so pronounced. No longer does Tom mark Price's comments as "[a]nother of his lesson-sabotaging sallies" (P120.15, V138.19), or the students as "(The mob, the mob)" (P121.14, V139.21), nor does he think of Price: "So that undoubtedly intelligent mind of yours chooses dumb insolence" (P142.28, V164.09). He even becomes less harsh on himself, no longer thinking, with Brechtian alienation ef- fect, "Use the stage-space. Speak into air. Any moment now Price will say: what are you pacing around for like a ham performer? Stop acting the school-teacher" (P143.36, V165.20). One of the more interesting sets of revisions occurs in Chap- ter 20, "The Explanation of Explanation," in which Tom confronts Price after school. As Tom asks for an explanation as to why Price consistently interrupts class lectures, Price smiles mockingly. In the first edition, Tom realizes that no explanation is needed "[b]ecause the situation denounces itself (my autocratic posturing): oppressor and oppressed" (P143.02). In the revision, Swift alters this to read "[b]ecause the situation denounces itself, the tableau is complete: op- pressor and oppressed" (V164.21). This revision de-emphasizes Tom's sense of control and more appropriately suggests the confining nature of circumstances that dictate behavioral roles. Ultimately, this idea permeates the actions and rationalizations of Tom, a correlation that is stressed by the line immediately following the passage in both texts: "Consider this … how so much of history is a settling for roles, how so much of it happened because no one said what they really—" (P143.04, V164.22). If such a revision emphasizes Tom's lack of control, the revisions that depict Price's emotions and actions seem to display Price as more ambiguous and thus more in control. In his clownish white make-up and Punk-spiked hair, Price is certainly more self-consciously playing a role than Tom. His view of history as a "red herring" (V165.10), for instance, is now considered a "position" (V165.10) instead of the original "thesis" (P143.26), suggesting an intellectual frame of mind rather than a conjecture, and, significantly, Tom is the one speaking of the "posi- tion." In addition to this mere change in diction, Swift made several revisions that clearly imply a blurring of the power struggle between Tom and Price. In the first edition, for example, as Tom raises his hand to touch Price's shoul- der, the description of Price's reaction reads, "Rapid chain-reaction in Price's eyes. Alarm. Hasty defensive shutter-drawing; equally hasty switch to offensive. Lip-tightening" (P144.20). Swift modified this description to read, "His expres- sion falters, then hardens, switches to the offensive. I turn, rebuffed, and walk back between the desks" (V166.06). Here, Price's emotions are made less certain through the removal of the distinct facial gesticulations. Of more significance is the inclusion of Tom, rejected and hurt, walking back through the rows of desks in response to Price's aggressive facial contortions. In fact, this inclusion suggests Tom's sense of defeat and Price's certain upper-hand. Just before the climax of the chapter, Swift revised a passage reading "I turn round. His lip is quivering" (P145.16). Swift deleted Tom's actions and made Price's gesture less distinct: "The face is all twisted" (V167.03). Directly before Price reveals his belief that "explaining's a way of avoiding the facts while you pretend to get near to them" (V167.07, P145.21), Swift diminished the emotional depiction by modifying "Twisted features trying to reform. Trepidation trying to hide. Voice struggling to release some punch-line" (P145.18) to read "The voice wavers. He's struggling to release some punch-line" (V167.05). The fear or trepidation evident in his facial contortion is replaced by a wavering voice, a much more ambiguous portrayal in that a wavering voice may not indicate fear but rather nervousness or angst. The revisions made to the confrontation scene clearly diminish the char- acterization of Price's emotions. In contrast, Tom's authority is further defined by the newly uncertain emotions of Price. Tom's relationships to his half-brother, Dick, and his own wife, Mary, also modify slightly. The text no longer insistently distances Tom from Dick, because passages such as "(even though I viewed matters academically from the other side of the pubertal gates through which I had yet to pass)" (P161.34, V186.21) and "(but not his mother, because his mother's dead)" (P209.26, V242.24) were deleted, as were the following passages relating to his perception of Mary: seed. (Seed indeed!) (P35.26, V41.32) (like old Thomas Atkinson, should Mr Crick strike Mrs Crick and let all hell loose?) (PIII.14, V128.04) Mary, do you remember our Sunday walks, with which we trod and measured out the tenuous, reclaimed land of our marriage? (PIII.35, V128.26) And again. Mary, what became of our love? (P113.17, V130.13) "Psychological disturbance there may have been. Yet the account given to the husband seems perfectly lucid." Ah, but if you had been there, your worship … (P269.10, V311.23) window. Enclosed within the circle of a crucifix. (P285.36, V330.13) amnesia's best, perhaps amnesia's the cure for all … (P285.38, V330.14) Several of these passages indicate that Mary and Tom have broken the cycle of abusive relationships that appear so often in the Atkinson family, that Tom ex- periences a genuine sense of loss over his wife, and that Tom once wrung some small consolation for himself in thinking that Mary may be protected in some way by her crucifix and may have found some safety within forgetfulness that he will never be accorded because of his need to remember in great detail, points muted or outright silenced through the deletions. If Tom's responsibilities to Dick Crick and to Mary have been muted through revisions and deletions, his responsibilities to himself are adjusted even further. The most striking change, though, concerns Tom's sense of responsibility for his own involvement in the actions of 1943. In the 1992 edition, Swift revised passages to make Tom's sense of responsibility more ambiguous. At the mo- ment the reader believes Tom will candidly confess his involvement in three murders, Tom states: "I confess my responsibility, jointly with my wife, for the death of three people (that is, if, in the second instance, we are truly speaking of a personS—we're still uncertain, aren't we, of the status of the embryo?—and if, in the third, what we're speaking of was indeed a death …)" (P272.06). In the 1992 edition, the passage is revised to read, "that is—it's not so simple—one of them was never born, and one of them—who knows if it was really a death" (V314.26). Tom's questioning of "the status of the embryo" is a poignant clue as to his feel- ings of and evasions of guilt. In the first passage, Tom uses the logic pattern "If A, then B": if these deaths can be considered real, then I am guilty of murder. This attempt to rationalize the status of the victims implies culpability. By comparison, the revised passage devictimizes the victims by avoiding specific terms such as "person" and "embryo." Because this thought is so evasive, it characterizes Tom more fully, making him less honest and less courageous than the Tom in the first edition. Not only does the truth evade Tom, but it also evades the reader. Tom Crick's rationalizations emphasize his reluctance and hesitation in sharing the entire story with his students, his readers, and himself. And, indeed, Swift may have made a strikingly crucial mistake when he deleted several sentences from Tom's final plea for forgiveness in the novel—the climactic moment of Tom's confession. In the 1992 edition, Tom now only asks of his third victim, "(Forgive me, Dick.)" (V351.14). Originally, the passage was considerably longer, consider- ably more rhetorical, and considerably broader in its request for deep forgiveness and genuine recognition of his own role in the deaths: (Forgive me, Dick. To malign your final gesture, your last recourse, with the taint of madness, to rob it of reality: I, if anyone, knew there was reason in your plight. I, your brother. Your brother. Your brother?) (P304.05) Although a number of the revisions do no more than tighten syntax and emphasize details, Swift occasionally sharpens images and allusions through re- vision. One of the most interesting revisions occurs in the table of contents, in which Chapter 37, entitled "Le Jour de Gras" (P233) in the first version, changes to "Le Jour de Gloire" (V270) in the second. Because the chapter discusses the brutal beheadings by guillotine during the French Revolution, the substitution of "gloire" for "gras," an ironic "glory" instead of a flippant "fat (meat)," is indica- tive of Swift's ability to sharpen images and heighten ironies. Swift effectively hones his allusions as well and deepens their significance for his text. Tom Crick contends that when the world ends, all that will be left will be stories: "We'll sit down, in our shelter, and tell stories to some imaginary Prince Shahriyar, hoping it will never …" (P257.14). This allusion to Shahriyar, and implicitly Scheherazade, from The Arabian Nights, is more fully realized by Swift's revision to "We'll sit down, in our shelter, and tell stories, like poor Scheherazade, hop- ing it will never …" (V298.03). The substitution of Scheherazade is significant because it makes the allusion much more powerful in relation to the rest of the novel: the emphasis is now on the story-teller rather than the listener, on the individual hoping to avoid execution rather than the judge, and, of course, this relates evocatively to Tom's attempts to escape full responsibility. Quite often, Swift replaces his less connotative diction with more evocative and expressive synonyms in order to sharpen images and strengthen details. Silt as a "subverter of rivers" (P299.32) becomes a "usurper of rivers" (V346.13), for instance, implying the land's omnipotence in overtaking the river rather than the land's catalytic ability merely to destroy the river's course. "[E]xists" (P92.24) is changed to "looms" (V106.26), suggesting the foreboding and threatening nature of questioning the past. Similarly, Swift sharpens the details and descriptions by correcting prepositional phrases and converting them into adjectival phrases such as "breast of frock-coat" (P285.14) to "frock-coated breast" (V329.33) and "noise as of whipped-up waves" (P288.29) to "wave-like noise" (V333.18), the latter in the extensively revised Easter convocation scene in which the storm- at-sea simile is more fully developed in the revisions. In one instance, the simile of Tom's forehead "grained and polished, like old wood" (P135.01) is appropriately revised to "waxy and furrowed" (V154.33). He is, after all, no longer valued by any one, as a piece of antique furniture would be. The thirty-two additions introduce fewer than sixty new words into the text, a clear indication that addition was the least of Swift's tools at this point in craft- ing his text; moreover, eighteen of the additions occur in four chapters (9,12,14, and 44). At one point, between chapters 24 and 39, over one hundred pages pass without a single addition. When Swift does add words, however, his intentions are clear: to clarify a reference, occasionally to complete a sentence broken off in the first edition, and to deepen a description through an expressive adjective. In the first edition, "where you—?" (P270.01) and "How far—?" (P272.04) are typical broken sentences; Swift expanded them to read "where you left the car? (V312.13) and "How far back is that?" (V314.23). Elsewhere, he added brief clauses and phrases to smooth transitions between sentences. In the first edition, Tom and Mary leave Lewis Scott's home and "walk in silence, each lost in misty thoughts" (P108.24). In the second, we learn that the "misty thoughts" stem from "the Scotts' dinner fully dissected" (V125.02), and during the Easter convocation, Tom's initial comment on the "official rallying cry—of the Holocaust Club" (P288.34) acquires the revealing interpolation, "official rallying cry (I know this) of the Holocaust Club" (V333.22), suggesting that he may not be totally innocent when it comes to knowing about the planned demonstration. Shortly before his one victorious moment in the novel, the moment when he gives his eloquent final address to the students and realizes Price has been won to his side, Tom Crick comforts himself, in the face of doubts, by thinking, "(No, no, not afraid—no, I've told it all, told it all, unabridged …" (P285.33, V330.11). Swift struck this brief paragraph from the text and in so doing cut yet one more subtle glimpse into the psyche of his protagonist. His revisions to Waterland pose a problem, largely because they are only sporadically consistent. It is quite apparent, for instance, that while Graham Greene's revisions to The End of the Affair (1951) are guided and driven by a thematic agenda, revision of Waterland was a much more casual activity driven by no agenda during the actual process of rivision. 15 15. See Higdon, "'Betrayed Intentions': Graham Greene's The End of the Affair ," The Li- barry 6th ser. 1.1 (1979), 71–77. The novel's revisions were virtually accidental in origin but clearly are significant in effect since they reshape our perception of Tom Crick and Tom's theory of history. 16 16.

Russell (Rusty) Reed took his Master's Degree in Technical Writing at Texas Tech University and now works in the computer world.
