      <field name="fulltext">THE EDITOR WHO APPROACHES ROMEO AND Juliet must carefully consider the first quarto, Q1, published in 1597, and the second quarto, Q2, published in 1599. Q1 is in its entirety a substantive edition. It was at no point printed from any document now extant. Granted the fact that, as we shall see, Q2 depends directly on Q1 at certain points, it is nevertheless abundantly clear to the most superficial observation that, as a whole, Q2 is not a reproduction of Q1. Q2 depends also on some other, non-extant, source—presumably a manuscript. In the main Q2 is also a substantive edition. Only Q1 and Q2 have the status of substantive editions. Q1 is a 'bad' quarto, and Q2 is a 'good' quarto. It is generally agreed, I believe, that Q2 gives a text taken in the main from an authentic documentary source. As regards the Q1 text, I subscribe to what I take to be a common view—namely, that it is a memorial reconstruction—the work of a reporter or reporters. The first question which I should like to discuss is—what exactly was the nature of the copy for Q2? It is well known that there are some conspicuous bibliographical links between the two quartos. They indicate that, at any rate at certain points, Q2 was printed from a copy of Q1. Indubitable and impressive links are to be found in an extended series in the passage stretching from I ii 57 to I iii 36. 2 This passage occurs in both editions on sheet B. Links in this passage have been pointed out and discussed by various critics—Robert Gericke, Miss Greta Hjort, Sir Walter Greg, and Mr. Sidney Thomas. 3 Mr. Thomas has shown, 4 in my view convincingly, that here we are dealing, not with independent derivation of the two printed texts from the same document, but with a direct dependence of Q2 on the printed pages of Q1. Noting a number of links in this passage, Miss Hjort apparently sprang to the conclusion that Q2 in its entirety was printed from a copy of Q1 which had been corrected by an editor by comparison with another document. I am not the first to point out that this could not be so, since there are some pages in Q1 which simply could not have been altered in pen and ink in order to yield the Q2 text: more alterations and additions would have been required than there would have been room for on the Q1 pages. Miss Hjort's theory will not do as regards the nature of the copy for Q2 as a whole . Sir Walter Greg subsequently suggested that the copy for Q2 consisted of (i) a first quarto, corrected by an editor, in handwriting, as far as the end of sheet B, and (ii) from that point on, a transcript of a playhouse manuscript. Here are Sir Walter's own words: "It seems clear that some editor was commissioned to prepare the copy for an authorized quarto, and for this purpose was provided with the 1597 edition and a playhouse manuscript. He began by taking the printed text and elaborately correcting and expanding it by comparison with the manuscript, but when he got to the end of sheet B he decided that it would be less trouble to make a transcript of the latter. This he proceeded to do through the remainder of the play, though I will not say that he may not have used other fragments of the printed text, and I am certain that he consulted it on occasions when the manuscript was obscure." 5 Now in the article which I have cited Mr. Thomas makes a point which seems to me sound, and which necessitates a modification of Sir Walter Greg's theory. Let us consider the relationship between the two quartos up to the end of Q1 sheet B, leaving the Prologue out of account until further notice. From the first line of the first scene of the play up to the end of Q1 sheet B, there are no bibliographical links between the two quartos before I ii 57. There is nothing between I i 1 and I ii 56 which in any way necessitates the view that Q2 depends on Q1. From I ii 57 to I iii 36 there is a considerable amount of impressive evidence indicating a direct dependence of Q2 on Q1. Some of this evidence consists of errors in Q1 which are reproduced in Q2. On the one hand these errors were not corrected: and on the other hand there is no textual difference between the two quartos in the relevant passage which need be regarded as a correction by an editor. Between the two points with which we are here concerned, I ii 57 and I iii 36, the two quartos show only a handful of verbal differences. At I ii 68 Q1 has an "and" which Q2 lacks (Q1 "my faire Neece Rosaline and Liuia , Q2 my faire Neece Rosaline, Liuia,); but the Q2 compositor could easily omit a single word by accident, and it is highly probable that the Q1 "and" is correct, since the context appears to be verse, and the "and" is necessary for metrical smoothness. At I ii 77 we have the variant Q1 "thee", Q2 "you" (Q1 "Indeed I should haue askt thee that before", Q2 "Indeed I should haue askt you that before"). The Q2 compositor may well have made the substitution unconsciously himself as he carried a group of words in his head while setting up type. Or perhaps his eye caught the "you" in the next line. At I iii 12 we have Q1 "a", Q2 "an". Q2 is right, for the next word is "houre" (Q1 "Faith I can tell her age vnto a houre", Q2 "Faith I can tell her age vnto an houre" ); but the Q2 compositor could easily make the obvious correction on his own responsibility. At I iii 33 Q2 has a definite article which is desirable from the point of view of sense, and which is absent from Q1 (Q1 "to see it teachie and fall out with Dugge", Q2 "to see it teachie and fall out with the Dugge" ); but, again, the Q2 compositor could easily have supplied it on his own initiative. And these four appear to be the only verbal variations between the two quartos in the passage extending from the first to the last bibliographical link in this portion of the play. 6 The position is, then, that in this passage certain errors in Q1 were not corrected in the copy for Q2, while the few small verbal alterations that there are in Q2 can all be attributed to the Q2 compositor himself. It looks, then, as if between I ii 57 and I iii 36 Q2 was printed from Q1 unrevised by scribal intervention. Now Mr. Thomas argues 7 that, before and after this passage, Q1, up to the end of sheet B, could hardly have been corrected to yield the Q2 text, for more alterations and additions would have been required than there is room for in Q1. I agree. And so I believe that Sir Walter Greg's theory of the relationship of the two quartos up to the end of Q1 sheet B must be modified. Q1 sheet B ends at I iii 100. My view of the copy for Q2 up to this point (excluding the Prologue) is as follows: from I i 1 to I ii 56 Q2 depends on manuscript copy; from I ii 57 to I iii 36 Q2 depends on Q1 unrevised; from that point to I iii 100 Q2 again depends on manuscript copy. This I take to be Mr. Thomas's view, and I think he is right. It is interesting to speculate on the question of why, at I ii 57, Q2 should suddenly begin to depend on Q1 instead of on the copy on which it has hitherto been depending, and why, at I iii 36, it should suddenly revert to copy other than Q1. An obvious suggestion is that between these two points a manuscript ultimately or directly underlying Q2 was mutilated or illegible, so that recourse had to be had, by editor or compositor, to the previously printed edition. Mr. Thomas, the most recent scholar to discuss this matter, has advanced this explanation. "The manuscript from which Q2 was printed," he declares, "either lacked the leaves which contained the lines [in question] or was completely illegible at that point." 8 Mr. Thomas is here reiterating the explanation given by the earliest critic who noticed the connection between the two quartos here—Robert Gericke. But I am not quite happy about this explanation, for the following reason. Round about the point where Q2 here ceases to depend on Q1, in the midst of a long speech by the Nurse, the Q1 text changes its character. Up to I iii 36 the Nurse's lines in Q1 have, I think, been metrically quite satisfactory. At I iii 36 Q2 suddenly ceases to depend on Q1, and only five lines further on we find that, while Q2 is still metrically satisfactory, Q1 shows a definite metrical breakdown. 9 Does this not at least suggest to us the idea that perhaps Q2 is dependent on Q1 in the passage with which we are concerned because that passage is in Q1 satisfactory in the main, whereas Q2 leaves Q1 at I iii 36 because Q1 becomes no longer satisfactory? That is what I tentatively suggest. Q2 leaves Q1 at I iii 36. Almost immediately Q1 shows memorial corruption. In Q1, immediately after Q2 has left it, the Nurse speaks of how Juliet could have "wadled vp and downe". In Q2 she speaks of how Juliet could have "run and wadled all about". I believe that in Q1 we have here an anticipation of II v 51 where the same speaker, the Nurse, refers to herself, in Q2, as catching her death with "iaunsing vp and downe". Q2 has no sooner left Q1 here in I iii than Q1—immediately—shows memorial corruption. Now we must be very careful. Immediately Q2 leaves Q1, Q1 has memorial corruption. But it may be suggested that Q1 has memorial corruption in the passage in which Q2 copies it— memorial corruption not detectable because there is nothing with which to compare the Q1 text (that of Q2 being the same). We must, then, be careful. The argument I should advance is this. In Q1, from the beginning of I iii up to I iii 36 the Nurse's part is satisfactory metrically: at I iii 36 Q2 leaves Q1: within five lines of this we find that Q1 is metrically unsatisfactory, whereas the different text of Q2 continues metrically sound: this suggests that Q2 may leave Q1 because, whereas Q1 had been satisfactory as a whole heretofore for a time, it no longer was. But why should Q2 leave Q1 four lines before the metrical breakdown in Q1? Well, in the very second line after Q2 leaves it, Q1 shows a memorial error. I admit that my suggestion is without absolute proof. But I should say that it seems to me reasonable to suppose that Q2 leaves Q1 at I iii 36 not because the manuscript behind Q2 has suddenly become legible again, where before, for a considerable stretch, it has not been legible, but rather because before I iii 36 Q1 for a time gave a text in the main satisfactory, whereas after that it does not. I should suggest, then, the following hypothesis, very tentatively. A person who may be called the Q2 editor, or Scribe E, was entrusted officially with the task of preparing copy for Q2. He was equipped with an authentic manuscript, and also with a copy of Q1. At I i 1 he began transcribing the authentic manuscript. But he continually looked at Q1, comparing it with the authentic manuscript. When he came to I ii 57 he read ahead in Q1, comparing it with the manuscript, and he found that for some time thereafter—up to I iii 36, in fact—Q1 was of good quality. He saw that after that point Q1 deteriorated sharply. And so, having up to I ii 56 been copying the authentic manuscript, he now tore out of his Q1 the two leaves, B3 and B4, which contained the patch of text he had found to be satisfactory. He drew his pen through the text on B3 r up to and including I ii 56, and he drew his pen through the text on B4 v after I iii 36. Then he simply put the two printed leaves, so dealt with, in the pile of leaves, hitherto manuscript, which he was producing to form the copy for Q2. We note, of course, that, while Scribe E found the Q1 text satisfactory between the two points, he neglected to correct (presumably even to notice) certain errors which Q1 in fact contained there: it is less satisfactory to us than it seemed to him. I cannot forbear referring to the well-known fact that a troublesome and interesting feature of this sheet B passage in which Q2 depends on Q1 is that in it the Nurse's lines are printed in italics in both quartos. The Nurse begins speaking at I iii 2, and that it is her first line in the play. Now since Q2 is dependent on Q1 in this passage, it is easy to say that the Nurse's lines are here printed in italics in Q2 because they are so in Q1. That, I think, is correct. The awkward question that must be faced is—why were they printed in italics in Q1 in the first place? I can only assume (and I do not think I am the first to do so) that in the manuscript behind Q1 the Nurse's lines in this section of text were written in the Italian type of handwriting, the speeches of the other characters being written in the English type of handwriting. The Q1 compositor reproduced this calligraphic distinction typographically. Now why should the Nurse's lines be written in any manuscript in a different type of handwriting from those of the other characters? I cannot see that it can be held in the least probable that anyone writing the play out straight ahead would on his own initiative vary his handwriting in this way. I take it, then, that at this point there lies behind Q1 a composite manuscript. One of the persons involved wrote the Italian type of hand. He wrote out the Nurse's lines, but not those of the other characters. What sort of manuscript would contain the speeches of only one character? Clearly, one presumes, an actor's manuscript part . The following theory would explain the facts. The persons responsible for producing the copy for Q1 had in their possession a manuscript fragment containing the beginning of the Nurse's part. This was written in an Italian hand. One of the persons involved in the production of the copy wrote the intervening speeches of the other characters into this manuscript fragment. He used an English hand. The result would be a scrap of manuscript in which the Nurse's lines appeared in one type of handwriting, and the intervening speeches of the other characters in the other type of handwriting. A compositor who decided to reproduce this difference typographically would produce a printed text such as we find in fact in Q1. Using Q1, the Q2 compositor, reproducing the typography of his copy, would produce what we find in fact in Q2. Such a manuscript fragment as I am suggesting would, one supposes, have originally contained cue-words, and these presumably were also written in Italian handwriting. But it is easy to suppose that in the composite fragment the cue-words were deleted when the complete intervening speeches were inserted in English handwriting. In connection with the italics in the Nurse's part a further point must be noted. Q2 leaves Q1 at I iii 36. Scribe E doubtless reverted to the production of manuscript copy. After I iii 36, sig. B4 v of Q1 could hardly have been corrected by hand so as to produce the Q2 text—there is not enough room. But Q2 continues to set up the Nurse's lines in italics for a while (up to the end of sheet B). That, I imagine,—and the suggestion does not originate with me,—is to be attributed to the Q2 compositor deciding to go on, on his own responsibility, making a typographical distinction no longer rooted in his copy. Italics for the Nurse cease in Q1 at the end of sheet C. Again, of course, it is not necessary to assume that, for the Nurse's speeches, Q1 depends on copy in Italian handwriting right up to the end of sheet C. The fragmentary manuscript part which we have postulated may have broken off before that, and the Q1 compositor may have continued his italics on his own responsibility until the absurdity of the procedure occurred to him or was pointed out to him. I have spoken of a fragment of a manuscript part: but I would point out that I have not claimed that it was authentic at any point. Scribe E accepted the Nurse's first 28 lines or so from Q1, and, as we have seen, they are metrically satisfactory; but that may be attributable simply to good reporting. A final word remains to be said about another detail of the Q1 italics problem in I iii. In Q1 the scene ends with a three-line speech by the Clown, and it is printed in italics. It is not so printed in Q2. The question is—does Q1, as regards this three-line speech by the Clown, rely on copy in Italian handwriting? I do not think it necessary to assume that it does. The Clown's italics may be laid solely to the charge of the Q1 compositor. For quite a time he has been setting alternate passages in italic and roman. The Nurse's final speech in the scene is in Q1 followed by a single-line speech by Lady Capulet, in roman, and then by a three-line speech by Juliet, also in roman. Then comes the Clown's three-line speech, in italics. It is quite conceivable that the Q1 compositor simply decided, on his own initiative, that it was time for italics again. Q1 sheet B finishes at I iii 100. Sir Walter Greg's theory was that up to this point Q2 was printed from a copy of Q1 corrected by hand. That theory we must, I think, reject; and we must substitute the following. From I i 1 up to I ii 56 Q2 was printed from manuscript copy: from I ii 57 to I iii 36 Q2 was printed from Q1 uncorrected by Scribe E: and from that point to I iii 100 Q2 was printed again from manuscript copy. It will be recalled that Sir Walter Greg's theory had it that after the point in the text which coincides with the end of Q1 sheet B the copy for Q2 consisted of a transcription of a playhouse manuscript—"though," Sir Walter declares, "I will not say that [the scribe] may not have used other fragments of the printed text, and I am certain that he consulted it on occasions when the manuscript was obscure." 10 We are now concerned with the question—what was the nature of the copy for Q2 after that point in the text which coincides with the end of Q1 sheet B? In 1919 Messrs. Pollard and Dover Wilson produced a set of articles on the Shakespearian bad quartos. 11 In these articles they discussed the origin of the bad quarto texts, and they advanced a highly ingenious theory. It was a very gallant attempt at explaining a very puzzling group of texts, and it was based on some acute observation. But it was wrong, as Mr. Dover Wilson is now the first to admit. Yet, as regards Romeo and Juliet, in enunciating and endeavouring to uphold their theory, Messrs. Pollard and Dover Wilson noted something which is undeniably true—that there are bibliographical links between the two quartos in two passages subsequent to the end of Q1 sheet B. These links are to be found at II iv 36-43 and III v 26-35. The passages occur in Q1 on leaves E1 and G3 respectively. In these two passages, admittedly short, there is between the two quartos a remarkable degree of agreement in the use of initial capitals and in the placing of colons; yet there are verbal differences in each case. Mr. Thomas suggests 12 that in these two passages we have examples of the Q2 editor consulting Q1 because the manuscript he was copying was illegible. I cannot myself think that this is a very likely explanation here. Consider the first of the two passages, II iv 36-43. The two texts run as follows: Q1 Ben. Heere comes Romeo . Mer: Without his Roe, like a dryed Hering. O flesh flesh how art thou fishified. Sirra now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowdin: Laura to his Lady was but a kitchin drudg, yet she had a better loue to berime her: Dido a dowdy Cleopatra a Gypsie, Hero and Hellen hildings and harletries: Thisbie a gray eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior R omeo bon iour, there is a French curtesie to your French flop: yee gaue vs the counterfeit fairely yesternight. Q2 Ben. Here Comes Romeo , here comes Romeo . Mer. Without his Roe, like a dried Hering, O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified? now is he for the numbers that Petrach flowed in: Laura to his Lady, was a kitchin wench, marrie she had a better loue to berime her: Dido a dowdie, Cleopatra a Gipsie, Hellen and Hero, hildings and harlots: Thisbie a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, Bonieur, theres a French salutation to your French slop: you gaue vs the counterfeit fairly last night. Mr. Thomas's theory assumes that when he came to the words "Without his Roe, like a dryed Hering" Scribe E found his manuscript difficult to read. So he looked at Q1. He copied these words from Q1, reproducing Q1's capitalisation. He then proceeded with the speech, copying Q1, copying its capitals and its colons. But he must have had his eye on his manuscript too, for he made changes in the text of the Q1 passage. Of course, it might be suggested that not all the alterations are his work. Perhaps in a given case the Q2 compositor made an alteration owing to carelessness. But we could not possibly hold that the Q2 compositor was responsible for all the changes in this short passage: there are too many changes in too short a passage to make that in the least likely. For at least some of the changes Scribe E must be responsible. But again, it might, I suppose, be suggested that Scribe E, copying Q1 here because his manuscript was illegible, altered Q1 memorially. That is certainly possible. But there is no positive evidence to indicate this hypothesis here, and it would, I think, be unsafe to have recourse to it. I think we must assume that some, if not indeed all, of the Q2 alterations in this passage came from the authentic manuscript used in the preparation of the copy for Q2. Now what of the suggestion that in this passage Scribe E consulted Q1 because the manuscript he was copying was illegible? If we accept that suggestion we must, I think, be prepared to take the following, for example, as sufficiently likely to be acceptable. Consider the portion of text beginning with the words " Laura to his Lady". Owing to illegibility in the manuscript before him, Scribe E applied himself to the task of copying out of Q1 the words " Laura to his Lady was but a kitchin drudg, yet she had a better loue to berime her:". He followed Q1 sufficiently closely to reproduce the capitalisation and the colon; but at the ninth and tenth words the manuscript before him suddenly became sufficiently legible to show him that instead of Q1's "drudg" he must write "wench", and instead of Q1's "yet" he must write "marrie". Having taken these words from the manuscript which was allegedly difficult to read, he returned to Q1, continuing to accept its capitals and its colons, but introducing other verbal alterations from the manuscript. I cannot say that this appears to me a very likely theory. I should rather say that the most reasonable explanation of the relationship between the two quartos in this passage is that Q2 was printed from Q1 itself, the latter having been corrected by Scribe E by comparison with his manuscript (which was not illegible). Of course, if any critic feels that the agreements in capitalisation and punctuation between the two quartos in the passage we are dealing with can be explained as simply a matter of coincidence, then he will not be much impressed by the above suggestion. I myself cannot regard them as a matter of pure coincidence. To postulate pure coincidence would be to strain credibility too far. For one thing, in the passage we have been examining there is a remarkable agreement between Q1 and Q2 in the matter of the setting up of proper names in italic or roman type. It is not only that the same words have initial capitals in both texts, and that the colons appear in exactly the same places: we also have to reckon with the fact that in both texts all the proper names in the passage are italicised except three—the same three in both texts—namely, Petrarch, Dido, and Cleopatra. In Q1 the first letter of "Dido" is in italic, the other three in roman: in Q2 all four letters of the name are in roman: but it is an essential agreement. I am sure that the name "Dido" appears in roman in Q2 because it does (essentially) in Q1, and that the names "Petra (r) ch" and "Cleopatra" appear in roman in Q2 because they do in Q1. Q2 surely depends directly on Q1 in this passage; but the Q1 passage has been altered editorially. I have not the space to examine the other passage I referred to—III v 26-35. I can only say that a comparison of the two versions of it seems to me to indicate the same conclusion. Now, having decided that in these two short passages Q2 is dependent on an edited copy of Q1, we naturally look carefully at the two leaves of Q1 involved—E1 and G3. We look at each in its entirety. And I should claim that it is possible, in pen and ink, to correct these two Q1 leaves in their entirety so as to give the Q2 text. I think it reasonable, then, to suggest, and I do suggest, that part of the copy for Q2 consisted of leaves E1 and G3 of Q1, corrected by hand in accordance with an authoritative manuscript, and then torn out of the particular first quarto used, and placed in the bundle of papers that formed the copy for Q2. It may be suggested that certain other leaves of Q1 were also torn out and, in an edited state, used as copy for Q2. I should like to suggest that Q1 leaf D1 may well be a case in point. This leaf includes the passage II ii 40-43. In Q1 it runs— Whats Mountague ? It is nor hand nor foote, Nor arme, nor face, nor any other part. Whats in a name? That which we call a Rose, etc. In Q2 we have— Whats Mountague ? it is nor hand nor foote, Nor arme nor face, ô be some other name Belonging to a man. Whats in a name that which we call a rose, etc. The Q2 version seems hardly satisfactory. There is nothing necessarily suspicious about the fact that in Q2 the half-line "Belonging to a man" stands as a metrically incomplete line. But some readers—and I am among them—consider that the phrase "some other name Belonging to a man" seems rather odd. I suggest that Q2 here depends on the Q1 page corrected by Scribe E. He wanted to indicate on his Q1 page the following version: Whats Mountague ? It is nor hand nor foote, Nor arme, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O be some other name. Whats in a name? That which we call a Rose, etc. To indicate this, he had to insert a complete line into his first quarto—"Belonging to a man. O be some other name.". I suggest that he put in the words "Belonging to a man." directly under the words "Nor arme, nor face,". I suggest that he inserted the words "O be some other name." in the right-hand margin. He drew a line connecting the beginning of this right-hand marginal insertion to the end of the interlinear insertion. This connecting stroke accidentally scored through the words "nor any other part", and the result was that the Q2 compositor thought that the words "O be some other name" were intended to replace the words "nor any other part", and he thought that these words, "O be some other name", were intended to be followed by the interlinear insertion, "Belonging to a man". The conflation, traditional since Malone, is I believe, correct. This may perhaps be regarded as tenuous evidence for the theory that here Q2 depends on an edited leaf of Q1. But that seems to me the best explanation of the textual conditions. The whole of Q1 leaf D1 can be corrected by hand in such a way as to produce the Q2 text—there is sufficient room for all the necessary alterations. I have suggested that part of the copy for Q2 consisted of leaves D1, E1, and G3 of Q1, corrected by Scribe E in the light of an authentic manuscript which was part of his equipment. Here I would mention the Prologue to the play. The text differs substantially in the two quartos, but there are similarities in the setting up. Both versions are set up in italics with a large initial letter in line 1; and both have brackets round line 2. I take it that this is a case of a page printed in Q2 from an edited copy of Q1. The Q1 text would have had to be altered extensively: but there is plenty of room on the page in Q1, even if the Prologue were to be almost completely rewritten; and I imagine that that was done. In dealing with the text up to I iii 100 (the end of Q1 sheet B) we contended that part of that stretch was in Q2 printed not from Q1, edited or unedited, but from manuscript copy. It is abundantly clear that at certain other points, later on, Q2 was again set up from manuscript copy. There are points where we can say with confidence that there would not be nearly enough room on the Q1 pages for the insertion of the necessary alterations and additions. It should be noted, however, that it is possible that at a given point, writing out manuscript copy, Scribe E may have consulted Q1 and imported into his transcription a Q1 reading. A case in point occurs, I believe, at II i 13. The two texts of II i 10-14 run as follows: Q1 cry but ay me. Pronounce but Loue and Doue, speake to my gossip Venus one faire word, one nickname for her purblinde sonne and heire young Abraham : Cupid hee that shot so trim when young King Cophetua loued the begger wench. Q2 Crie but ay me, prouaunt, but loue and day, Speake to my goship Venus one faire word, One nickname for her purblind sonne and her, Young Abraham : Cupid he that shot so true, When King Cophetua lou'd the begger mayd. (In Q1 the passage occurs on sig. C4 v .) Here, I think, Q2 was printed from manuscript copy. The word "prouaunt" is a misreading of "pronounc (e)" handwritten, and "day" is a misreading of "doue" handwritten. Now we can easily imagine Scribe E correcting the printed Q1 in the light of his authentic manuscript—misreading the word "doue" in the manuscript as "day"—scoring through the perfectly correct "Doue" in Q1, and substituting "day". But take the Q2 "prouaunt", a non-existent word. Suppose that Scribe E, correcting Q1, comes to the word "Pronounce" in it. He looks at the authentic manuscript. It is badly written, and it seems to him to read "prouaunt". But that is a non-existent word. Can we suppose that he drew his pen through the familiar word "Pronounce" in Q1, and substituted the nonsense-form "prouaunt"? It is possible, certainly, but, I think, hardly very likely. It is more probable, in my opinion, that, thinking at first that the manuscript read "prouaunt", and not recognising that as an existent word, he would be guided by Q1 to pause, examine the manuscript word very carefully, and realise that in fact it was "pronounce." He would not, then, alter Q1. But if the Q2 compositor were at this point setting up from handwritten copy, he might easily decide that a badly written "pronounce" was in fact "prouaunt", and so he would set that up. Elizabethan and Jacobean compositors sometimes did set up nonsense-words, owing to misreading of manuscript copy. For instance, in Q1 King Lear (1608), at III iv 119, the compositor originally set up "nellthu night more" instead of "mett the night mare". What he set up can have meant absolutely nothing to him: yet he set it up, assuming that he was following his copy. So, I imagine, as regards "prouaunt" in Q2 Romeo . I doubt if Scribe E would do this sort of thing. Later on in this paper it will appear that I think of him as a member of the company of actors to which Shakespeare belonged. Doubtless he was an actor. He would not cancel "Pronounce" in Q1 and substitute the absurd "prouaunt". I think that "prouaunt" represents a misreading by the Q2 compositor of manuscript copy written out by Scribe E. Scribe E wrote "pronounce" and the Q2 compositor misread it. Yet the Q2 "Abraham: Cupid" doubtless comes straight from Q1. "Abraham" may or may not be correct; but the curious colon between "Abraham" and "Cupid" certainly constitutes a link between the two quartos which, to anyone accepting the position taken up in this paper, must in Q2 indicate direct derivation from Q1, presumably by Scribe E. In this passage, it seems to me, Q2 depends on manuscript copy written by Scribe E: the latter was copying an authentic manuscript; but for "Abraham: Cupid" he was indebted to a consultation of Q1. At certain points, then, I think Scribe E furnished the Q2 compositor with copy in the form of leaves of Q1 corrected by comparison with an authentic manuscript. At certain other points he furnished him with copy which consisted of his own transcription of the same authentic manuscript. 13 What was the nature of this authentic manuscript which underlies Q2? In all probability it was a manuscript, in Shakespeare's handwriting, which had not itself been used as a prompt-book. In Q2 we find that in stage-directions and speech-headings Lady Capulet is referred to by half a dozen different titles (in full or abbreviated) — Wife, Capulet's Wife, Lady, Old Lady, Lady of the House, Mother. The late R. B. McKerrow pointed out that this sort of thing would tend to confuse a prompter, and would not be likely to appear in an official prompt-book. 14 In a prompt-book a given character would tend to be indicated consistently by one designation. A diversity of titles would, however, be quite natural in a playwright's own manuscript. At one point Shakespeare, thinking of the character in her relationship with the heroine, would call her "Mother"; at another point, thinking of her in her relationship with Capulet, he would call her "Wife"; and so on. Uniformity of designation would probably be substituted for this diversity in a transcription of the author's manuscript (with adaptation) which would constitute the prompt-book. Other suggestions that the manuscript behind Q2 was an author's manuscript which had not itself been used as a prompt-book are to be found in the fact that some necessary indications of entrances and exits are wanting in Q2, and in the fact that on occasion Q2 is capable of printing two different versions of the same passage. To sum up as regards the nature of the copy for Q2: the person who produced it, Scribe E, furnished the compositor with a pile of papers, some printed, some handwritten. The handwritten leaves were probably transcribed from a Shakespearian autograph manuscript. The printed leaves were torn from a copy of Q1. Some of them Scribe E corrected by comparison with the same Shakespearian autograph manuscript. As regards one passage, contained in two contiguous leaves of Q1, he left the Q1 text unaltered, contenting himself with the cancellation of the material which in the Q1 leaves preceded and followed the passage he accepted. Thus behind Q2 there lie three different types of copy—(i) Q1 unaltered, (ii) Q1 edited by comparison with a Shakespearian manuscript, and (iii) direct transcription of that Shakespearian manuscript. I should greatly like to discuss Q1 at length, but I must be brief. I have no doubt that Mr. Hoppe is in most respects correct in his recent book about this text. 15 His book is a most valuable contribution. The Q1 text is full of the kinds of error that we associate with reported texts—anticipations and recollections, inversions, vulgarisations, weak synonym-substitutions, paraphrase, metrical breakdown, and so on. Mr. Hoppe has marshalled much of this evidence very impressively. This or that individual example of corruption, we may say, might in itself be scribal or compositorial. But there are far too many egregious memorial corruptions to make it possible to avoid the formula of memorial reconstruction. The play has no sooner begun than we have in Q1 a remarkable example of the absurdity in which memorial corruption can on occasion result. In the first line of the Prologue, Q2 speaks, sensibly, of "Two housholds". Q1 has, instead, "Two houshold Frends", which in the context clearly makes nonsense. There is little doubt in my mind that behind the absurd reading of Q1 there lies a reporter's memory of a much later passage—III i 161. From the authentic version of the Prologue the reporter remembered "Two housholds", and the fact that enmity between them was involved. His mind sprang forward to III i, where, describing an affray between the two enemy households, Benvolio speaks in Q2 of how Romeo called aloud "Hold friends, friends part". The syllable "hold" constituted a memorial link which had the effect of bringing the word "friends" from Act III into the Q1 version of the first line of the Prologue, with nonsensical results. The Q1 text is not always so bad as this. There is some good reporting. Indeed Mr. Thomas, noting that "the first two acts and part of the third are remarkably well reported", has stated that he is inclined to believe that "the pirate had access to a manuscript there". 16 But even where the Q1 text is at its best, it seems to me that there is rather too much memorial corruption to allow of the theory of direct derivation from an authentic manuscript; and I am content with the theory of remarkably good reporting at some points, made up for by some exceedingly bad reporting elsewhere, notably towards the end of the play. Since in Q1 we are dealing with a memorially transmitted text, we must be very careful before we say that a given passage in Q1 represents a Shakespearian first draft, and the corresponding Q2 passage a Shakespearian revision. We cannot say this unless at a given point we are confident that the Q1 version can hardly be a corrupt version, indebted for its phrasing to the reporter or reporters. Now I confess that there are just one or two cases (no more than that) where Q1 contains a word (different from the Q2 reading) which seems to me rather unlikely as a reportorial substitution. For instance, at I iv 56 (in the "Queen Mab" speech) Q1 has "Burgomaster", Q2 "Alderman". I am not sure that the word "Burgomaster" would be likely to be substituted by a reporter on his own initiative. It could have been, I dare say. But some people might suggest rather that Shakespeare originally wrote "Burgomaster" and then, in a revision, changed it to "Alderman", that being a word more familiar to English audiences. Yet, if Shakespeare did originally write "Burgomaster", it may well be that "Alderman" is a change made, not by him, but by Scribe E (or someone else), intent on making the text fully clear to English readers. At no point in the play can I say that it seems to me necessary to suppose that there was any Shakespearian revision between the texts represented by Q1 and Q2. The theory that Q1 represents, accurately or inaccurately, a Shakespearian first draft has been not infrequently advanced by critics in the past. There are passages in which the two quartos diverge completely or almost completely, and such passages might at first sight tempt one to entertain the revision theory. But I am greatly attracted by Mr. Hoppe's suggestion 17 that the passages in Q1 which diverge widely from the phrasing of Q2 are to be explained as the work of a reporter who had at one time known the full version of the play—who had more recently known an abridged version, with these passages excised, and who therefore had a much dimmer memory of them than of the rest of the play— and who was in them, therefore, thrown back on his own phraseological invention more than elsewhere. Mr. Hoppe in his book suggests the possibility that Henry Chettle may be regarded as a "candidate for the office of reporter-versifier". 18 Independently of Mr. Hoppe, Mr. Thomas has also advanced the view that certain of the passages in Q1 which diverge radically from Q2 are the work of Chettle. 19 I cannot discuss the evidence here. Suffice it to say that I think it very possible that Chettle may have been involved in, for example, the Q1 version of II vi. But, if he was, he must be regarded as just as liable to be called a "reporter" as the person who produced the non-Shakespearian verse in the bad quarto of Hamlet : for, at certain points at any rate, the same procedure is followed. As Mr. Hoppe showed so well in 1938, 20 parts of Q1 II vi are to be explained as mosaics of recollections of different passages scattered throughout the authentic text of the play. Take for example the following lines in the Q1 version of II vi— Rom : My Iuliet welcome. As doo waking eyes (Cloasd in Nights mysts) attend the frolicke Day, So Romeo hath expected Iuliet , And thou art come. Jul : I am (if I be Day) Come to my Sunne: shine foorth, and make me faire. Here Juliet refers to herself as "Day" and to Romeo as the "Sunne". I believe that the person who wrote this passage had at the back of his mind two passages in other scenes in the Q2 version, and he inverted the Romeo and Juliet roles in both cases. In Q2, at II ii 3, Romeo, seeing Juliet at her window, exclaims " Iuliet is the Sun". In the Q1 passage under discussion Juliet refers to Romeo as her "Sunne". Then secondly, at III ii 17 in Q2, Juliet, in soliloquy, exclaims "Come night, come Romeo , come thou day in night". Here Juliet refers to Romeo as "day", and, in the passage in Q1 under discussion, she refers to herself as "Day". I venture to suppose that there can be little doubt that in the passage under discussion in Q1, which here diverges completely from the corresponding Q2 text, we have to deal with the work of some person who, knowing the play, brings together reminiscences of two widely separated passages, and combines them with his own invention into new composition. We find this sort of thing in the bad quarto of Hamlet : we find it in The Taming of A Shrew : 21 we find it in other reported texts also. It is a not unusual kind of reporter-work. Chettle may have been responsible for it here. If so, as I say, Chettle is as much a "reporter" as the actor of the parts of Marcellus and Lucianus in Hamlet who produced the copy for the bad quarto of that play. 22 Mr. Thomas thinks that Q1 II vi, after the entry of Juliet, is from the aesthetic point of view good, and indeed even better than the Q2 version. Speaking of the final line and a half of our last quotation from Q1— Jul : I am (if I be Day) Come to my Sunne: shine foorth, and make me faire.— Grant White avowed that they have "a touch of poetry more exquisite and more dramatic than is to be found in the" corresponding Q2 version. 23 Yet I am convinced that the explanation I have given of the genesis of this line and a half of Q1 is correct. If it is not, then we have to reckon with a couple of remarkable coincidences. A moment or two ago, I spoke of the theory that a Shakespearian revision lies between the texts represented by Q1 and Q2, Q1 giving us the text of a Shakespearian first draft. I do not believe this theory. Now in connection with the revision theory, I should mention, briefly, that there is of course a case for regarding not Q1 but Q2 as giving the first version, and for regarding Q1 as giving a reflection (admittedly distorted, but at a given point possibly accurate owing to good reporting) of a Shakespearian revision. Mr. Hoppe refers to this possibility in the introduction to his "Crofts Classics" edition of the play. 24 He thinks of only two lines, present in Q1 but not in Q2, as possibly "a later insertion by Shakespeare"—the lines containing the phrase "without booke Prologue" (I iv 7-8). But of course, regarding these lines as genuine (on account of their literary quality), or as reflections of genuine lines, we may easily suppose their omission from Q2 to be accidental. I know of nothing which positively indicates a revision theory either way. Having spoken of the nature of the copy for Q2, and of the nature of the transmission of the Q1 text, let us now consider the final question of what is to be the procedure of a modern editor of this play. I am at present engaged on the production of a modern-spelling edition of the play. That being so, and my space here being limited, I shall concentrate on the problems facing a modern-spelling editor, leaving out of account the special problems confronting an old-spelling editor. Let us take first the passage in which Q2 is dependent on Q1 as it stands without interference by Scribe E (I ii 57-I iii 36). Q2 here ranks as a reprint of Q1. In fact in this passage Q2 is not substantive at all, but derivative. Not a single alteration in Q2 in this passage need be referred to anyone other than the Q2 compositor. Clearly, then, where Q2 contains a reading different from that of Q1, we must accept the Q1 reading, unless in a given case we feel inclined to accept that of Q2 as a desirable conjectural emendation. Let us now briefly glance at two modern editions and see what they do as regards the four verbal variants between Q1 and Q2 which we enumerated earlier in this paper. The two modern editions we shall look at are the old Cambridge edition and Mr. Hoppe's recent "Crofts Classics" edition. (They are both modernspelling editions.) Both follow Q2 in adopting the phrases "an hour" (I iii 12) and "with the dug" (I iii 33) instead of "a hour" and "with dug" (Q1). They are right to do so. In these two cases the Q2 compositor has, on his own responsibility, made necessary corrections in Q1. Next: as regards the line which in Q1 runs " my faire Neece Rosaline and Liuia ," (I ii 68). Q2 lacks the "and". The old Cambridge edition, wrongly, follows Q2 and omits the "and". Mr. Hoppe, rightly, follows Q1 and inserts the "and" (printing the passage, correctly, as verse). Finally: as regards the variant Q1 "thee" Q2 "you" in I ii 77. Both the old Cambridge edition and Mr. Hoppe follow Q2 and read "you" instead of "thee". Now I regard the Q2 "you" as purely compositorial, and I confess that I can see nothing in the least objectionable about Q1's "thee". The Q2 compositor's "you" is not, in my opinion, a necessary emendation. I should read "thee". Mr. Hoppe doubtless had a reason or reasons for reading "you", but any possible reasons that occur to me can, I think, be successfully refuted. It is a small point, of course; but it is a matter of principle. In this passage, then, circumstances have resulted in our having only one substantive text, and in our having to include in our editions of Romeo a bad quarto passage of not inconsiderable length—material which at one stage has been transmitted purely memorially. Obvious errors we can emend. Corruption is not, however, always self-evident: and at a given point in this passage it is possible that Shakespeare's intentions are irrevocably lost, and that our texts will remain corrupt to the end of time. Nowhere else in the play does an editor have to reckon with the same state of affairs as in this passage. Let us leave it now, and concentrate on the rest of the play—the great bulk of the play. I have suggested that some other leaves of Q1 were torn out and, in an edited state, used in the copy for Q2. As regards these passages we have in Q2 a good text which stands in the same relationship to an antecedent bad text as does the folio version of King Lear . The folio text of Lear was printed from a copy of the quarto which had been corrected by an editor. 25 Now, as Sir Walter Greg has pointed out, 26 there is in such a case a greater presumption of genuineness in a good text reading where it differs from the bad text reading than where it agrees with it. That is true; but I want to emphasise that even where the good text reading differs from that of the bad text, we must carefully scrutinise the pair of variants and consider whether the good text reading does in fact seem to us to be the right one. I have said that I think that part of the copy for Q2 Romeo was leaf D1 of Q1, corrected in handwriting. Now at one point in Q1 leaf D1 (on the verso side) we have the following passage: For thou art as glorious to this night beeing ouer my As is a winged messenger of heauen (head, Vnto the white vpturned woondering eyes, Of mortals that fall backe to gaze on him, When he bestrides the lasie pacing cloudes, And sailes vpon the bosome of the aire. (II ii 26-32) The Q2 text agrees with this verbally in the main, but for the Q1 "lasie pacing cloudes" Q2 has "lazie puffing Cloudes". Now at first thought one might suggest the following: the Q2 text was printed from an edited copy of the Q1 leaf—the corrector, Scribe E, altered the Q1 "pacing" to "puffing" because "puffing" was the reading of his authentic manuscript—and so we must accept "puffing" as the genuine reading. But I cannot do this: I think that Q1's "pacing" is the correct reading. The image of lazy pacing clouds is a very good image. Now it may be said that the image of lazy puffing clouds is also a good image. One can, poetically, imagine a cloud, in a lazy mood, puffing from one point to another, pausing there, lazily, and then after a time puffing on to yet another point, and so on. But I believe that the context shows that Shakespeare is thinking of a much smoother motion than that would necessitate. "When he bestrides the lazy—something—clouds And sails upon the bosom of the air." Sailing upon the bosom of the air suggests a very smooth motion. There is something awkwardly incongruous in proceeding from lazy puffing clouds to smooth sailing on the bosom of the air. I repeat: consider the passage carefully, and it must surely seem that Q1's "pacing" (a smooth enough motion) fits in better with the context than does Q2's "puffing". The Q2 "puffing" suggests something rather jerky, which jars in a context otherwise devoted to smoothness. * Now, assuming that Q2's "puffing" is corrupt, I believe it is possible to show how the corruption arose. I think it is a memorial corruption. At I iv 96 Mercution talks of dreams which are begot of nothing but vain fantasy; and this vain fantasy is as thin of substance as the ayre, And more inconstant than the wind who wooes, Euen now the frozen bosome of the North: And being angerd puffes away from thence, Turning his side to the dewe dropping South. That is the Q2 version; but the word "puffes" occurs in the passage in Q1 also. This word, with its suggestion of a jerky movement, is entirely appropriate here, for the wind is angered. We have the notion of a petulant, jerky movement: it is admirable. Now we are dealing with a passage in a later scene and a passage in an earlier scene. In the passage in the later scene I suspect that the Q2 word "puffing" is wrong. In the earlier scene the word "puffes" occurs (in both texts, note) with admirable appropriateness. I think that the presence of "puffing" in the later scene in Q2 is due to Scribe E having remembered "puffes" from the earlier scene. And I can claim that it is very likely that the two passages, the one in the later scene and the one in the earlier scene, could have been associated in the mind of a scribe or editor who knew the play; 27 for there is a clear phraseological link between the two passages: in the later passage we have the phrase "the bosome of the ayre", and in the earlier passage we have the "ayre", and, two lines later, the "bosome of the North". This suggests that the Q2 "puffing" is not a straightforward misreading of the word "passing" in handwriting, as, in his "Crofts Classics" edition, Mr. Hoppe apparently considers it to be. 28 The passage involving the "lasie pacing cloudes" occurs in Q1 on leaf D1. I think that Q2 was set up from copy which included Q1 leaf D1 corrected by comparison with an authentic manuscript. But, if I am right, in our passage Q1 already contained the true reading. The corrector, Scribe E, must have substituted "lazie puffing Cloudes", not because his manuscript read that (for it did not), but because he himself had an impression that that was the right reading. He was wrong: his impression was based on faulty memory. But he had that impression, and it induced him to alter Q1's perfectly correct reading, and substitute a wrong reading. If his authentic manuscript was at this point difficult to read he would have some excuse for relying on his own (admittedly defective) knowledge of the play. Perhaps it was. As regards passages of the play, then, in which Q2 was printed from edited leaves of Q1, what is a modern-spelling editor to do? Where Q2 agrees with Q1 he must be watchful. In a given case Scribe E may have negligently failed to make a necessary correction. The modern editor must be prepared, where he considers it necessary, readily to emend a reading in which the two quartos agree. He will of course accede to the necessity of doing so where the reading in question in itself gives evidence in its context of being corrupt. Where there is no self-evident corruption, the modern editor will doubtless accept readings in which the two quartos agree. But corruption is not always self-evident, and the modern editor will agree that in a given case in which he accepts a reading exhibited by both Q1 and Q2 he may in fact be accepting a non-Shakespearian reading. It is not possible to produce a text which we can guarantee to be free from corruption. Now, as regards passages printed in Q2 from edited leaves of Q1, the modern editor must, where Q2 disagrees with Q1, assume that the Q2 reading comes from the authentic manuscript which Scribe E had as part of his equipment, unless in a given case there seems a strong enough reason for supposing that the Q2 reading is an error introduced by Scribe E or by the compositor. If a Q2 reading which differs from Q1 does appear to a modern editor, for good reason, to be corrupt, he must decide whether to accept the Q1 reading or whether to propose a reading differing not only from Q2 but also from Q1. There are various possibilities. Scribe E may have altered a perfectly correct Q1 reading owing to his having misread the same word in the authentic manuscript before him. Scribe E may have failed to decipher the manuscript, and, through faulty memory, on his own responsibility, he may have altered a perfectly correct Q1 reading. Scribe E may even on his own responsibility have sophisticated a reading in which Q1 and his authentic manuscript agreed. Scribe E may have altered an erroneous Q1 reading by substituting, in the Q1 page, a misreading of a different word in his authentic manuscript. Scribe E may have replaced an erroneous Q1 reading by a word which he wrote so badly that the Q2 compositor misread it. All these various possibilities add up to this—that the modern editor must scrutinise each variant as a case in itself. He will be prejudiced in favour of Q2. If no reason for rejecting Q2 appears to him, he will accept Q2. But he must always be prepared to accept a Q1 reading, if good reason can be shown. A reporter may, by chance, correctly reproduce a Shakespearian reading which the authentic transmitters corrupt. Finally, at certain points Q2 was printed from a transcript of Shakespeare's manuscript, and is independent of Q1 except for possible occasional consultation of Q1 by Scribe E or the Q2 compositor. Apart from such cases of possible consultation, agreement between the two quartos is now a presumptive guarantee of authenticity. In a given case of agreement here, we may say that Scribe E, copying Shakespeare's manuscript, derived a certain reading from it. Quite independently, the Q1 reporter, relying only on his memory, conveyed the same reading. Scribe E and the reporter thus corroborate each other. And yet really the position is not so good as that. For there is always that troublesome factor of possible occasional consultation of Q1 by Scribe E or the Q2 compositor. Any given agreement between Q2 and Q1 might be explained as a case of such consultation. Thus a modern editor should still scrutinise every word of the text, where the two quartos agree, in order to determine whether emendation is desirable. Next: where Q2 (set up from manuscript copy) differs from Q1, we must assume, unless in a given case there is any reason against doing so, that the Q2 readings are derived from the Shakespearian manuscript, and are thus genuine. This is so. Yet we must still reckon with the possibility that in a given case the Q1 reporter's memory was good, so that he correctly remembered the Shakespearian reading, whereas Scribe E or the Q2 compositor corrupted it. Just as on one occasion when he was correcting Q1 Scribe E put in a reading ("puffing") which was in fact a memorial corruption, so I believe he did on one occasion when he was transcribing the Shakespearian manuscript. I think it would be difficult to suppose that Q1 leaf D3 was corrected by hand to form copy for Q2. I think that here Q2 depends on manuscript copy. Now at the end of II ii (on that leaf) Romeo says, according to Q1, "Now will I to my Ghostly fathers Cell". In Q2 he says "Hence will I to my ghostly Friers close cell". I am concerned with the latter half of the line. The Q2 version seems to me odd. The words "ghostly Friers" are awkwardly tautologous. Sir Walter Greg agrees that the Q2 line is corrupt. He says that its ending "can only have originated, one supposes, in inability to decipher the playhouse manuscript" 29 i.e., in our belief, the Shakespearian autograph manuscript. Whether it was a matter of Scribe E failing to decipher the authentic manuscript or not (and it may well have been), I believe that the words he penned in his transcript owed their existence in his mind to a memorial anticipation of V iii 254, where the same Friar referred to speaks of having meant to keep Juliet "closely at my Cell" (Q2 only). 30 If, in a portion of the play printed in Q2 from manuscript copy written out by Scribe E, a modern editor can argue cogently that a given reading in Q1 is good, and that the corresponding reading in Q2 is corrupt, and if he can explain how the allegedly corrupt reading in Q2 might have arisen in the light of his general theory of how the Q2 text was transmitted, then he is, I think, entitled to adopt the Q1 reading, unless it can be suggested that a better case can be made out for a third reading, consisting of an emendation of the Q2 reading to a reading different from that of Q1. It seems to me, then, that in editing Romeo one has to have Q1, an edition of little authority in general, on one's desk all the time, as well as Q2, an edition of very much greater authority in general. I do not think that, editing the play in accordance with the principles I have been discussing, one will find oneself introducing very many readings from Q1—just a handful, I imagine. The Q1 text is in the main a manifestly inferior text. But I submit that as one proceeds with the work one must be prepared to consider the adoption of a Q1 reading in a given case, even though Q1 is a bad quarto. If one adopts a Q1 reading in preference to a Q2 reading, one must be prepared to state strong and cogent reasons for so doing. These reasons may in a given case be literary. I do not think that a textual critic can ignore literary considerations. But I repeat—the reasons must be strong and cogent. Yet, if there are strong and cogent reasons, the modern editor should not ignore them on grounds of timidity.</field>

The paper has been slightly revised and expanded, but it is not exhaustive, and it is still presented, as it was originally, as a tentative piece of work. 2 Throughout this paper the act, scene, and line numbers of Romeo and Juliet are those of the old Cambridge edition. 3 Gericke in Shakespeare Jahrbuch, XIV (1879), 270-273; Hjort in MLR, XXI (1926), 140-146; Greg, Principles of Emendation in Shakespeare (British Academy Lecture, 1928), reprinted in Aspects of Shakespeare (1933), where the relevant pages are 144-147, 175-181; Thomas in RES, XXV (1949), 110-114. 4 RES, XXV, 111. 5 Aspects, pp. 144-145. 6 The first link in this portion of the play is the spelling "Godgigoden" (both Qq.) in I ii 57; the last is the reading Q1 "aleauen" Q2 "a leuen" in I iii 36, after which word we cannot in Q2 sheet B assume dependence on Q1. 7 RES, XXV, 112-113. 8 Ibid., p. 114. 9 The words " hee was a merrie man: Dost thou fall forward , Iuliet?" are unmetrical. 10 Aspects, p. 145. 11 In the Times Literary Supplement .

He thinks that it may be more appropriate in the context than I have allowed. The word may be intended, as he points out, not so much to refer to locomotion as to call up in the hearer's or reader's mind "the frequent pictures of clouds in the shape of cherubic heads with lips pursed as if puffing breezes and winds to earth." It is an excellent point. And yet, despite this, I cannot resist the feeling that the excellence of Q1's "pacing", and the fact that "puffes" occurs in I iv in a passage sufficiently like the present one to make memorial confusion eminently possible, render at least not unreasonable the view which I have taken above. 27 The Q2 compositor can hardly be responsible for associating two passages so far apart. It must surely have been Scribe E. I take it that Scribe E must have known the play. I dare say he was a member of the acting company which owned the play. 28 Hoppe reads "lazy-passing" in his Crofts text. 29 Aspects , p. 146. 30 Since there is a memorial error in a portion of Q2 which depends on handwritten copy, it would seem clear that that handwritten copy was a transcription of the Shakespearian manuscript, and not leaves of that manuscript itself. See note 13 above. Incidentally, I cannot forbear referring to a third case in which I think there is memorial corruption in Q2. This is a case in which I cannot be sure whether Q2 was set up from an edited page of Q1 or from manuscript copy. It occurs at III i 118. Tybalt has killed Mercutio. Benvolio tells Romeo that Tybalt is coming back again. Romeo says, in Q1, "A liue in triumph and Mercutio slaine?"—which makes good sense. In Q2, he says, rather strangely, "He gan in triumph and Mercutio slaine,". I presume that "gan" is an error for "gon". It is odd that Romeo should speak of Tybalt as "gone" when he has just been told that Tybalt is coming back. But at III i 87-88 Mercutio, dying, says "I am sped, Is he gone and hath nothing." (Q2). I think that at the later point Scribe E was influenced by a recollection of this. The words "Is he gone" are entirely appropriate at the earlier point, since Tybalt has there just fled.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Some Bibliographical Notes on Samuel Daniel's Civil Wars by James G. McManaway</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FIRST FOWRE BOOKES OF THE CIVILE warres between the two houses of Lancaster and Yorke (1595; a fifth book appeared without title-page or date) by Samuel Daniel, 1 which has long engaged the attention of Shakespearians, is a fine poem, well worth reading for its own sake. Since no part of it is included in the recent volume of selections from Daniel edited by Professor A. C. Sprague, the text is not readily available. Before a modern edition can appear, there are several bibliographical puzzles to be solved. Some of the data for their attempted solution are collected in "A Bibliography of the Works of Samuel Daniel, 1585-1623" 2 by Mr. H. Sellers; others which I shall use are derived from my examination of the copies in the Carl H. Pforzheimer, the Pierpont Morgan, the New York Public, and the Folger Shakespeare Libraries and the Library of Congress, and from other information generously supplied by officials in several other institutions. 3 The first problem relates to the title-page of The First Fowre Bookes , of which there are two distinct printings, each printed by Peter Short for Simon Waterson, and each dated 1595. One of these bears McKerrow and Ferguson's title-page border 160, which has at top a compartment enclosing the Royal Arms between Fame and Victory; 4 I shall refer to copies with this title-page as the "Royal Arms issue." The other is printed with McKerrow and Ferguson border 177, which has at the top "IHS" in a circular glory; 5 copies with this title-page will be called the "IHS issue." Since the verso of both title-pages is blank and the collation of most copies is i 1 B-Z 4 , with the text beginning on B1 r , it is not easy to determine how the two title-pages were printed. 1. The most economical method would have been to set up the two pages simultaneously and print them together with one pull of the bar, after which they could be separated and attached indifferently to the text. It seems unlikely that Short did this, for the two title-pages were printed on several different kinds of paper, and among the copies I have had the opportunity to examine carefully I have found no one variety of paper used to print both kinds of title-page. Furthermore, the surviving copies of the book have the IHS page in the ratio of two to one. Finally, there are at least two copies which have a blank leaf conjugate with the title-page—Professor Hazen reports this of the IHS copy at Columbia University, and Mrs. Richmond of the IHS copy in the Chapin. The problem of the priority of the title-pages is complicated by the fact that the book did not sell as rapidly as the author and publisher might have wished, with the result that in 1599, when Waterson had Short print Musophilus, Cleopatra , etc., unsold copies of The First Fowre Bookes were put first in a volume bearing the title, The Poeticall Essayes of Sam. Danyel . . . , 1599 . In some copies of Poeticall Essayes, The First Fowre Bookes retains the Royal Arms title-page; others, the IHS title page; while yet others have a cancel title, The Ciuill Wars of England . . . , 1599 . The ratio in copies known to me is seven to sixteen to ten, respectively. 2. If The First Fowre Bookes did not sell rapidly, did Waterson attempt to improve sales by cancelling the original title-page at some time between 1595 and 1599 and having Short print a cancel? This seems unlikely, because copies of Poeticall Essayes (1599) are known in which The First Fowre Bookes has now one and now the other 1595 title-page. 6 This would indicate that Waterson's remainder stock in 1599 must have included copies of the 1595 book in both issues, an unlikely state of affairs if he had decided to insert a new title-page at some time after 1595. 7 At first he issued copies of Poeticall Essayes (1599) with whichever 1595 title-page came to hand, but after a time he substituted the cancel title-page dated 1599 to disguise the fact that approximately half of the book consisted of remainder sheets. 3. A third possibility is that the change from one title-page to the other was made when the book was being printed in 1595. 8 Of the copies I have examined, none has a blank leaf conjugate with the title, and although others may exist I have a record of only the Columbia University copy referred to above, in which an IHS page is followed by a conjugate blank A2 (the watermark is tentatively identified as a dog), and the Chapin copy, in which the IHS title-page—without watermark—is preceded by a conjugate blank leaf. Mr. Sellers assumes the presence of such a blank but cites no copy containing it. It is possible, therefore, that most of the blank leaves were removed and used to print the second title-page. Or the substitution of one page for the other may have come as a stop-press correction. I incline to this last explanation and suggest that the Royal Arms page was displaced when not more than a third of the edition had been printed. At this point the IHS page was substituted, and copies were delivered to Waterson for sale in the proportion of one with Royal Arms to two with IHS title-pages. 9 As has been stated, unsold copies of The First Fowre Bookes were incorporated into the volume issued as Poeticall Essayes in 1599. It is not my purpose to prepare an edition of either work, and so I have not collated the text; but there is no reason to suspect that it varies except as stop-press corrections were inserted. 10 The second problem is presented by Daniel's Book V. This is known in two different printings, as Sellers points out, but he leaves unanswered several pertinent questions: what is the relation of one edition to the other; when were the two editions printed; and by whom? It is obvious at a glance that neither edition was intended to have an independent existence. There is no title-page in either edition and no colophon. Each begins with a head-title which serves to identify it, the spelling in one being "fift" and in the other "fyft." The collations are identical, Aa-Ee 4 ; and the foliation in each is 89-108, consecutive with that of The First Fowre Bookes . It is clear, I think, that Book V is a later continuation, for both 1595 title-pages mention only four books, and it is safe to assume that both editions were in existence in 1599 when Poeticall Essayes was published, for the cancel title-page bearing that date which Waterson prefixed to The First Fowre Bookes reads, The Ciuill Wars of England . Within these limits, the date of composition—and first printing—of Book V is unknown. Whenever it came from the press, one would expect the author to insist upon a cancel title-page to advertise his augmentation of the text, and the publisher to accede in order that a slow-moving, but now more expensive book might be made more attractive to customers. Yet not until 1599 was an inclusive title-page prepared, and it is not present in all copies of Poeticall Essayes . Collation of the two texts will satisfy anyone that one edition was printed from the other. For example, the erroneous catchword "Of" on Bb3 r is found in both editions, as is the misspelling "mimens" (for "immens") in stanza 52 line 5. Two curious spellings, common to both editions, may also be noted: "We'ill" in 88.9 and "Be'ing" in 105.2 (in 116.3, "fift" book reads "be'ing" but "fyft" book "being"). The variant in stanza 116, line 3 suggests that the spelling "be'ing" is peculiar to Daniel (or his scribe) and that the "fyft" edition, which normalizes it to "being" is derivative, i.e. , that the "fift" edition came first and that "fyft" is a reprint of it. The suggestion is supported by the fact that while "fift" has an erroneous catchword, "Thus" on Dd1 r , "fyft" reads correctly "Thys." 11 There is other than textual evidence, however, and in my opinion it not only confirms the priority of editions just suggested but also shows that the editions did not come from the same printing house and that neither was printed by Peter Short. In the first place, three different fonts of type were used in printing (a) The First Fowre Bookes , (b) the "fift" book, and (c) the "fyft" book. The printer's measure for the books in the order just listed is 101 mm., 103 mm., and 94 mm. And an eight-line stanza measures respectively 45 mm., 45 mm., and 48 mm. This evidence is, of course, not conclusive, but it is significant that throughout Books I-IV, Short uses a digraph oo, 12 while in the "fift" and "fyft" books the digraph never appears. 13 There are other typographical differences, but they may be passed over to consider weightier evidence. The fift Booke has on Aa1 a head ornament 90 x 14 mm., in the center of which is a human face with a small crescent above the forehead; on each side of the head is an approaching snail. This ornament occurs also in both 14 1595 editions of Robert Southwell's St. Peters Complaynt , which in their imprints are said to have been printed by John Wolfe in 1595. 15 There is good reason for thinking, however, that after 1594 Wolfe acted only as a publisher. 16 An examination of other books printed in 1594, 1595, and 1596 discloses the fact that other ornaments of the Southwell books were used repeatedly in those years and even later by John Windet. For example, the tailpiece on G4 v of the first 1595 "Wolfe" edition of St. Peters Complaynt is on A2 v and G4 v of the second 1595 "Wolfe" edition; this compact ornament showing two cherubs playing a lute and a viol was used frequently by Windet. 17 Another ornament, which shows the half-figure of a child and two satyrs, is in the two "Wolfe" 1595 editions of Southwell and in several books printed by Windet. 18 Since Peter Short used none of these ornaments it appears probable that John Windet printed the two editions of St. Peters Complaynt in 1595 for John Wolfe and that he was also the printer called in by Simon Waterson in or shortly after 1595 to print The fift Booke of the Ciuill warres betweene the two Houses of Lancaster and Yorke . 19 His employment is not remarkable, for in 1593 he had printed STC 6467, The Defence of Contraries , for Waterson. There is visible proof of the haste with which sheets of The fift Booke were made available to Waterson for binding up with unsold copies of The First Fowre Bookes . In the two Folger copies, Aa1 r of The fift Booke has offset clearly on Z4 v of The First Fowre Bookes . There is light offsetting throughout The fift Booke , most noticeably on Aa1 v , Dd1 v , and Dd3 v , which bear offsets of the marginal glosses on the facing rectos. This appearance of haste in what I take to be the first edition of Book V puzzles me. It would not be surprising in a small second edition, run off when it was discovered that the first edition was nearly sold out. But the ratio of survival of the two editions, 16 to 6, points clearly to The fift Booke as the earlier and larger edition. Next we may consider the identity of the printer of The fyft Booke and its date. There is no head ornament to help identify the printer, but the watermarks resemble closely those in Edward Guilpin's Skialetheia which was printed in 1598 for Nicholas Ling by James Roberts. 20 It is true that other printers may have used paper from the Bayonne area about this time, and so the identification of Roberts on this evidence cannot be considered final. Waterson employed Roberts to help print STC 6254, Daniel's Delia and Rosamond in 1594. In the same year Roberts printed for him STC 19383, Robert Parsons' A Booke of Christian Exercise and reprinted it in 1598 ( STC 19384), 1599 ( STC 19384a), and 1601 (19385). Relations between the two men were continuous in the period in question, and, as we shall see, Roberts was almost certainly the printer of a disjunct leaf of "Faults Escaped in the printing" which is found in a number of copies of Daniel's poem. 21 This leaf of "Faults Escaped," which presents the next problem, has a head ornament measuring 91 x 16 mm., with a butterfly in the center. The same ornament occurs repeatedly in other books printed by Roberts. In STC 7203, Drayton's Ideas Mirrour (1594), for example, it is on B1, B2, C1, C2, D3, D4, E3, E4, F3, F3 v , G3, G3 v , and H1 v . Other books in which it is found are STC 1084, Babington's A Briefe Conference (1596), B1; STC 16958, Lupton's A Thousand Notable Things (1595), A2; STC 17059, Lyly's Euphues (?1595), B1; and STC 22956, Southwell's St. Peters Complaynt (for Cawood, 1595), A4, F2, H4 v , and I2. The paper is unlike that used elsewhere in The First Fowre Bookes and Poeticall Essayes for title-pages or text, having chain lines very wide apart—35 mm. Unfortunately, no copy examined has a watermark. My conclusion is that James Roberts was the printer of The fyft Booke and also of the leaf of Faults Escaped, and that they were produced in 1599, when Waterson discovered that he had an insufficient quantity of The fift Booke to match the remainder copies of The First Fowre Bookes . Of the twelve corrections indicated in the list of errata, five are for the first four books and seven for the fifth book. The leaf could not have been printed, then, until at least one edition of Book V was in existence, 22 and it appears safe to infer that both editions of Book V preceded it, for neither edition has any of the corrected readings in the copies I have examined. 23 So much for certain of the bibliographical puzzles connected with the variant title-pages of The First Fowre Bookes , the two editions of Book V, and the Errata Leaf. Whether or not my solutions be correct, no editor dare produce a modern edition until they are solved. For as Sir Walter Greg has demonstrated, 24 the authoritative text is that based on the author's manuscript; in it will be found the closest approximation to what he wrote—his spelling, his punctuation. The other text is wholly derivative. Moreover, until we know with the greatest possible certainty how much time elapsed between the writing of Books I-IV and Book V of The Civil Wars it is impossible to estimate Daniel's development as a poet. Is the historical point of view in Book V the same as in the earlier books? If there was a long interval before the writing of Book V, were Daniel's thought or his verse modified by the English historical plays being acted on the London stage or by the various complaints and heroical epistles being published by other poets? Until a dependable chronology, supported by bibliographical evidence, can be formulated, there is no answering these and cognate questions. Now let us turn back to The First Fowre Bookes and consider briefly a problem that I have not attempted to solve, but upon which it is possible to make a few observations. The text of this book was printed on various kinds and qualities of paper. One Folger copy (HH 65/29) is printed on a cheap paper that has turned quite brown. The watermarks are generally alike throughout the book, and the chain lines are about 25 mm. apart. The paper in another Folger copy (HH 65/30) is markedly superior; one kind of watermark appears in sheets S and Y and another elsewhere in the book, but neither resembles those in HH 65/29; and chain lines are about 30 mm. apart. In the other three Folger copies, much the same kind of paper is used throughout, to judge by the watermarks and by the chain lines, which are about 27 mm. apart. But the paper is quite different from that in HH 65/30 and HH 65/29. I suspect that a few copies were printed on cheap paper, the bulk of the edition on good paper, and perhaps a small number of copies on fine, large paper. 25 I have put the cheap paper copies first because in HH 65/29, the Folger copy printed on thick paper, the marginal gloss on Q4 r is improperly located, as noted above; but this same copy has the corrected headline on Z3 v . One should really collate all copies of the book and after tabulating the uncorrected and corrected states of the formes should correlate the data with a complete listing of the watermarks in every copy. Since I am not engaged in editing the book, I have not collated all copies; and it will surely be agreed that I have no right to impose upon busy curators of rare book collections by asking for a report on the watermarks. This is a study that should be undertaken, however, for Daniel's Civil Wars merits reprinting, and we know all too little about fine-paper editions of Elizabethan books.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 These notes are extracted, with some modifications, from a paper read at the English Institute on September 8, 1950. 2 In Oxford Bibliographical Society Proceedings &amp; Papers, 1927-1930 (Oxford, 1930), II, 29-54, 341-342. 3 I am particularly grateful for details received from Prof. William A. Jackson of the Houghton Library at Harvard; Mr. Herman R. Mead, of the Henry E. Huntington Library; Prof. Allen T. Hazen, of Columbia University; Mr. C. J. Hindle, of the Bodleian Library; Dr. Zoltan Haraszti, of the Boston Public Library; Dr. Donald Wing, of Yale; Mrs. Donald E. Richmond of the Chapin Library; Professor R. H. Griffith, of the University of Texas; and my colleague, Dr. Edwin E. Willoughby, who examined the copies in the British Museum. 4 Used originally by Henry Bynneman as early as 1580, this was altered slightly and used by Ralph Newbury and Henry Denham in 1584; by Peter Short in association with Richard Yardley in 1592, and by Short alone in 1594; and with another slight modification by Short from 1595 until 1600. It next appears, again with a difference, in 1614 in STC 2549, printed for the Co. of Stationers. 5 This border was used once by Henry Denham in 1582 and next by Peter Short in Daniel's First Fowre Bookes (1595). By 1609, its next recorded appearance, it had been dismembered. 6 Perhaps some allowance should be made for the sophistication of copies that have been rebound. The British Museum copy C. 59. g. 26 of Poeticall Essayes retains the Royal Arms title-page to The First Fowre Bookes, plus The fyft Booke; as does the Hoe-Huntington copy, which however, has also the Ciuill Wars (1599) title but no text of Book V. The Pforzheimer copy, in original vellum, has the IHS title-page in combination with The fyft Booke ; it has also the errata leaf. 7 As yet no reference has been made to the dating of Book V of the Civil Wars, two editions of which were printed by 1599, but it should be evident that if Waterson needed to arouse interest in a slow-selling book, he would mention the presence of additional material in any cancel title-page he might elect to issue. 8 It may be argued that the scarcity of the Royal Arms title-page is to be explained by the fact that the IHS issue came first, after which Waterson had the Royal Arms title-page printed as a cancel but sold relatively few copies. Then in 1599 the stock of Royal Arms title-pages was replaced by the 1599 cancel Ciuill Wars title-page. This seems to me unlikely. 9 It is not surprising, nor need it be significant, that so few copies of the book have a blank leaf conjugate with the title, for most copies have been rebound. The Pforzheimer copy of Poeticall Essayes in original vellum lacks the blank, which might have been considered objectionable, coming as it does after several pages of preliminaries. 10 Attention is directed to several formes in which variants have been noted. In the Manwood-Folger copy, inner E reads "The" at I, 91, 5, as prescribed in the list of Faults Escaped, while the other copies examined read "Tho". Inner F has a variant in the signature of F2, which frequently appears as E2; the F of F2 in the Heber-Folger copy appears to differ from that in the Manwood-Folger and Harmsworth 65/29-Folger copies—perhaps the original F was dislodged and replaced carelessly by an E, which in turn was corrected to F. Inner Q has a variant in the position of the marginal gloss on Q4 r , which in HH 65/29-Folger occurs improperly opposite lines 1 and 2 of stanza 91, but in other Folger copies is placed correctly opposite line 1 of stanza 90. In the Folger copies, the headline of V1 v is "THIRD" instead of "FOWRTH"; the same error occurs on X1 v and X3 v ; the error reappears on Z3 v of the Manwood-Locker-Harmsworth-Folger, the Heber-Harmsworth-Folger, and the Huth-Harms-worth-Folger copies but is corrected in the Brooke-Harmsworth-Folger and the Folger cs. 82 copies. This is not the only variation in inner Z; there is a slight change in the position of the numerals of stanza 104 on Z1 v and a greater one in the numerals of stanza 119 on Z4, the copies agreeing as before. (Prof. Griffith, who first noted the last variant, reports that in the Texas copy, Wg/D226/595faa, there is no comma after "amities" in 121.2 on this page; it is present in the other Texas and the Folger copies). 11 On the other hand, "fyft" is erroneously signed Ec3, where "fift" is correct. 12 As in "tookst" at 2.2.5, "lookt" at 2.10.1, "Sooth'd" at 2.18.4, "good", "stood" at 3.20.4,6, "soone" at 3.114.4, and "tooke", "good" at 4.61.3,4. Short continued to use the digraph oo in parts of Poeticall Essayes printed in 1599. 13 See, for example, 5.5.1,2; 5.7.5; and 5.50.3. 14 In the STC both editions are assigned the number 22957, but the notes on the Huntington Library copy indicate what a comparison of the Folger 56-page edition with a microfilm of the Huntington 65-page edition confirms; namely, that there are two distinct editions, the shorter being the earlier. The headpiece is on A4 and F4 of the first 1595 edition and on A4 and G3 of the second. 15 For directing my attention to this fact and to other uses of the head ornament that is on the leaf of "Faults Escaped," I wish to record my thanks to Mr. John Crow of King's College, London. 16 See H. R. Hoppe, "John Wolfe, Printer and Publisher," The Library , 4th ser., XIV (1933), 267. 17 See STC 23697, Tasso's Godfrey of Bulloigne (1594), Gg1 v ; STC 17669, Maunsell's The First Part of the Catalogue of English Printed Bookes (1595), i 3 v ; STC 13681, Three Sermons on Homelies (1596), D1; STC 6551, Delgadillo de Avellaneda's A Libell of Spanish Lies (1596), G2 v ; STC 24128, Topsell's The Reward of Religion (1597), X4; and STC 13712, Hooker's Of the Lawes of Ecclesiasticall Politie , "The fift Booke," A8. 18 See STC 22957 (both editions), A2; STC 6551, printed in 1596, A4 v , C4 v , E1; STC 18748 Nun's Comfort against the Spaniard (1596), A3; STC 24127, Topsell's The Reward of Religion (1596), A5 v. 19 The watermarks in the paper used in printing The fift Booke , a figure shaped somewhat like a teardrop in which is a cross and below which are, variously, the initials, BB, BR, IA, etc., are wholly unlike those seen in any copy of The First Fowre Bookes . 20 That in Bb of The fyft Booke , a sphere containing the letter M, with an inverted heart pendant and a flower-like figure above, is much like Briquet's 14068, manufactured in Bayonne in 1593. Another watermark has much the same shape but is surmounted by a fleur-de-lis and encloses a heart. 21 It is suggested in the Pforzheimer Catalogue I, 242, that Roberts printed the errata leaf, but no evidence is adduced. 22 The list of errors in The First Fowre Bookes was based on a copy that had forme inner E in the uncorrected state; cf. note 10 above. 23 It is possible that the list of Faults Escaped was in existence before the second edition of Book V was printed and that it was ignored in the reprint, just as the list of Faults Escaped in the 1590 edition of The Faerie Queene was ignored by Richard Field (and Edmund Spenser) in the second edition of 1596. If so, we should have to postulate that the Roberts edition preceded the Windet edition, for in spite of the dissimilarities in paper it seems likely that the errata leaf was printed at the same time as one of the editions of Book V and by the same man. 24 See his "Rationale of Copy Text," Studies in Bibliography , III (1950), 19-36. 25 Professor Griffith notes that copy Ag/D226/S95f at the University of Texas measures 83/16 x 6" and queries whether it is a large-paper copy. The Pforzheimer copy, in original vellum, is 7½ x 5½". Most copies have been trimmed in the process of being rebound.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Bibliography and the Editorial Problem in the Eighteenth Century * by William B. Todd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OF THE MANY PROBLEMS THAT HARASS THE bibliographer of eighteenth-century literature, perhaps the most vexing are those involving the proper discrimination and ordering of multiple editions. In this period undenominated reprints are to be suspected everywhere, among elaborate editions running to several volumes, among popular books of any length, even among casual works of lesser size and consequence. Though it would be futile to suggest an occasion for all of this duplication, an explanation for some may be found in a reported conversation between Andrew Millar, a prominent bookseller of the day, and several members of the clergy at St. James. When asked what he thought of David Hume's essays, Millar replied, as he later informed the philosopher, "I said I considered y r Works as Classicks; that I never numbered y e Editions as I did in Books We wished to puff." 1 From this we may presume that, for Millar and others of similar intent, multiple editions may appear as the result of a deliberate policy among the booksellers to disguise reprints of standard works. The greater the importance of a book, they must have reasoned, the less the necessity for pushing its sale, and the more the inducement for duplicating the original issue. A close facsimile would be readily accepted by those who wished to buy the first, authoritative printing. A close facsimile was, then, what they oftentimes attempted to produce. If Millar's statement can be inferred as expressing a general policy, then we have not only been forewarned as to what we may expect in Hume's works and advised as to what actually happened in those of Fielding's which Millar published, but given some reason for the presence of two or three concealed editions in practically every major production in the eighteenth century, and some anticipation of further discoveries and other difficulties in this neglected province of bibliography. 1a For the presence of other reprints, however, Millar's observation will not suffice, since it excludes all works not considered—in the eighteenth-century view—as classics. But where there are two or three hidden editions of the major works, there seem to be among certain kinds of minor productions as many as four, five, or six, all very much alike and often undiscriminated in bibliographies. The occasion for multiplicity of this order arises, perhaps, from economic rather than literary considerations. For obvious reasons, a publisher would be reluctant to invest in such ephemera as topical poems, plays, and political tracts, and would accordingly prefer to underprint, and print again as necessary, than to overproduce a lot of sheets which would then remain unsold. Paper, in these days, was an expensive item, amounting to forty per cent of the cost of production for small issues, over sixty per cent for larger ones, 2 and therefore not to be squandered on casual effusions of uncertain reception. Hence we may see why Lawton Gilliver printed four limited editions of Bramston's Art of Politicks (1729), any one of which might be considered as a "first"; 3 why Thomas Cooper, a prolific purveyor of literary trifles, found it necessary to print five editions of Lord Lyttelton's Court Secret (1741-42) before a lagging demand required a "puff" with one called the second; and why this same publisher, a year later, printed no less than six editions of Edmund Waller's and Lord Chesterfield's Case of the Hanover Forces (1742-43) prior to the publication of a "second." 4 Given the cause in economic necessity, all of this reprinting becomes credible, and should become a matter of record. In addition to the literary and economic reasons, already presented, another and more significant occasion for reproduction in the eighteenth century is the removal of all legal restrictions upon the size and frequency of issue and the use and reuse of type. With the expiration of the Licensing Act in 1695 and the gradual abrogation of the powers exercised by the Stationers' Company, the esoteric "arte and mysterie" of printing, as it was called in the earlier period, became in this a common trade, subject to few prohibitions, and producing on a scale of greater extent and complexity than anything witnessed before. Despite the laws of copyright, or perhaps because of them, the publishers duplicated their own issues, not infrequently copied those of their competitors, and, with notable exceptions, resorted to the term "edition" for successive issues only as an expedient for moving the book. Thus for one reason or another, or for no reason at all, reprinting became a custom, evident, as I have indicated, among first editions of any sort, and, as well, in several other categories: (1) among subsequent editions properly described, as in the two fourth editions of Gray's Elegy (1751), the two second editions of Pope's Use of Riches (1733), and, if I may again refer to variants undifferentiated in the present accounts, the three third editions of Pope's Epistle to Burlington (1731); 5 (2) among authorized but undesignated reprints, as in the double editions of the 1723 Hamlet , the 1724 Othello , the 1729 Macbeth , 6 and the 1770 versions of Goldsmith's Traveller ; and (3) in outright piracies, as in the three undiscriminated 1797 editions of Burke's Letter to Portland 7 and the four misrepresented 1770 editions of Goldsmith's Deserted Village . And so the reprinting continues, to be reported for relatively few books, to be observed in many, to be suspected in all. If multiple editions in different settings of type represent a problem too often ignored in contemporary accounts, even more of a problem, but one accorded even less recognition, is that of multiple impressions from the same setting of type. Where the seventeenth-century compositor, with a limited amount of type at his disposal, usually had to break down a setting after every sheet in order to recover sorts for further use, the eighteenth-century compositor, with apparently unlimited quantities of type at hand, could on occasion set as many as 350 pages and allow this enormous aggregate of metal to remain intact for innumerable impressions. Some of these are labeled second and third editions, some are not so dignified. Some appear with substantial textual alterations, some without the alteration of a comma. In one printing house no less than 94,900 pieces of type were composed for a certain book and then retained for a series of impressions, all published within seventeen days. The paper which went over the presses in these seventeen days I conservatively estimate at 137,500 sheets. 8 For such extensive reimpression as this there is no precedent in the sixteenth or seventeenth century, hitherto no exposition of an expedient means for detecting it in the eighteenth, and consequently, no reliable method for interpreting the complexities in printing which have developed over the years. To illustrate the resulting confusion, let us consider the voluminous bibliographical literature on Samuel Johnson, and particularly the commentary on those of his works published by Thomas Cadell. Since Cadell was an apprentice to Andrew Millar, and later his successor, we should expect some irregularity. And something is amiss, both in the bibliographies and in the books. Of four works published between 1770 and 1775 a "second edition," not otherwise described, is recognized from its designation in the books I will call A, C, and D, and presumed from the existence of a "third edition" in B. Actually all, including B, have at least one "second edition," but of a kind quite different from that which the term implies. In A and the unknown B it consists of a partial resetting and a partial reimpression; in C, a complete reimpression; and in D, no less than three distinct reimpressions. With the evidence now at our disposal, and shortly to be divulged, all of this is easily perceived. Without it, the second edition of B remains "suppressed," as we are now informed, 9 the three second editions ( i.e. , impressions) of D undiscriminated, and the problems inherent in all of these entirely undisclosed. From this example of misinformation we now turn to bibliographies in which, though more may be expected, occasionally less is fulfilled. In S. L. Gulick's account of Chesterfield—recommended, I might add, by no less an authority than R. W. Chapman as a model of accuracy 10 —an examination of seven works discloses all manner of confusion: two impressions erroneously classified as states, two sets of two editions, each described as one, and a third set entirely overlooked. Similarly, in R. H. Griffith's bibliography of Pope, a survey, again confined to seven works, reveals two states classified as impressions, three sets of two editions, each described as one, and one set of three, likewise represented as a single entity. This production has also been approved in the reviews, including, for instance, those by George Sherburn and A. E. Case, 11 where it is reported in one (and implied in the other) that the copies at Chicago and Yale are identical with the ones described, when, as a matter of fact, they differ from these, from others accessible to the reviewers, and indeed from others in the same collection. If this is the situation in the bibliographies of Johnson, Chesterfield, and Pope, all of which are considered as definitive, what may we expect to find in those not so recognized? And what, we may inquire, is the status of scholarly commentary based on the premises of these bibliographies? To these questions we may individually provide the answers which seem appropriate. Having the temerity to proceed thus far in what may be taken as a general indictment, I must go a step further. No one, least of all the present writer, should presume to say what has happened without suggesting the cause and the cure. As any insinuation of incompetence would, of course, be irrelevant for bibliographies regarded as authoritative, this may be discounted and two other reasons advanced. For one, the standards of examination so readily accepted ten or twenty years ago, and so often in evidence today, have been superseded by those which require, among other things, some facility in the interpretation of various technicalities, the comparison of such differentiæ as headlines, the use of control copies or something that will serve as a control, and—whatever the inconvenience to the person concerned—the inspection of numerous copies in addition to the several represented in special collections. For the other, the books to be examined, in the eighteenth century, are, as I have intimated, the products of conditions of greater complexity than those which apply in the earlier periods, and therefore occasionally require supplemental techniques for their analysis. It has not been sufficiently realized that printing, in this century, has progressed beyond the era of the simple handicraft and now represents one of mass production, where not a few but hundreds of pages of type may be retained and repeatedly returned to press, where not one or two individuals but batteries of pressmen and compositors may produce, in a matter of hours, editions running into thousands of copies, where not one but several books may be put to press and worked concurrently by the same personnel. These practices, though extraordinary in the seventeenth century, have become commonplace in the eighteenth, and now demand a consideration frequently evaded or ignored in our present studies. The only procedure that fully accounts for the altered circumstances of book-production in this period is one that utilizes the evidence peculiar to these circumstances. Evidence of this sort, we may be assured, is usually not to be found in the materials of production—in obvious irregularities in type, paper, and ink—all of which tend to be standardized and uniform, but in the actual process of production, as this is revealed by the press figures. These little symbols, appearing now and then in the lower margin of the page in many eighteenth-century books, were first reported, I believe, by Griffith in his Pope bibliography, and have since become involved in several suppositions as to their original use to the printer and their present use to the bibliographer. Contrary to McKerrow's prediction that they would prove to be of little importance, recent investigation has shown that they may be interpreted as signs of cancellation, variant states, half- or fullpress operation (indicating the employment of one or two men at the machine), type pages arranged within the forme in some irregular pattern, sheets impressed in some abnormal order, an impression of the formes for each sheet by one man working both formes in succession, or two men working both simultaneously, impressions interrupted for one reason or another, reimpressions or resettings of the book, in whole or in part, copy distributed among several shops, overprints involving an increase in the number of sheets machined for certain gatherings in order to meet an unanticipated demand for copies, and underprints consisting of a decrease in the number of sheets in order to reduce the issue and speed its publication. 12 Now that they are displayed in the figures, these various ramifications in composition and presswork may not be overlooked by any editor cognizant of his responsibilities, for here and there in a process so involved he should expect to find an unnoticed reading, an altered passage, or an entirely different edition from that on record. Since the figures disclose so much of possible textual significance which might otherwise remain unrevealed, they are, notwithstanding McKerrow, of some importance, not only in the discrimination and analysis of concealed or known editions, but in the bibliographical description of the books examined. If the figures are included in the record, any variant unknown to the compiler can be immediately detected and appropriate measures taken to establish its relationship to others in the series. If they are not included, then, of all the variants already mentioned, the most elaborate description will permit the identification of only a few of the editions and none of the impressions. An interesting example of the relative value of the figures and of the more conventional means of discrimination is afforded by Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790). According to Gathorne-Hardy's account, which is duly offered on the basis of differentiae in catchwords, ornaments, the spacing of type, and the length of a rule preceding the text, the first two editions of this book consist of sheets in two settings of type separate or mixed in several combinations. 13 As the figures intimate, however, and as an inspection of the discrepant copies will disclose, the type for this book exists in one to four settings, each occurring in one to four impressions, and all combined in a strange and wonderful manner to produce five distinct variants. Among these we may identify two editions—A, comprising a single impression throughout, and B, comprising four impressions, of which two (B1-B2) are undesignated and two (B3-B4) called a "Second Edition." Now, with all of this decided, unequivocally, the editor can proceed, in the manner that Sir Walter Greg suggests, to select as his copytext what is identified as the first edition, and then to add to this the revisions which Burke introduced in the edition called the "Third," an edition disregarded in the previous commentary, and also, in part, a reimpression. Though this is the required procedure, it has not been followed for the Reflections or for numerous other works of a similar nature simply because the problems incident to their manufacture have been ignored or misconstrued. Even when the variants are known, however, their relationship may be undetermined, again for want of appropriate bibliographical techniques. In some cases, as with the Reflections , the several editions and impressions can be ordered on the evidence of the figures alone, without reference to copy. In others, the later edition may be identified by the usual criteria, such as the inclusion of textual matter in the preliminary gathering of the Deserted Village piracies—those which are so highly esteemed as "private issues," or the gradation in the size and format of the Bramston, Chesterfield, and Lyttelton pamphlets to which I have referred, or the correction of errata in Tom Jones and in Gibbon's Decline and Fall , or the absence of cancels in Johnson's edition of Shakespeare, or finally, in watermarks, imprints, and advertisements, all of which materially assist in deciding the priority of the Monk editions. Other works not amenable to these several approaches can be subjected to a mechanical demonstration, such as the one Fredson Bowers exemplified for Dryden's Wild Gallant in his address before this Institute last year. 14 Nevertheless, with all of these techniques at our command, we still must contend with many eighteenth-century editions which continue to be bibliographically intransigent. These bugaboos infest what one writer has called "The Bibliographical Jungle" 15 — a wild locale visited by a goodly number of adventurers, all of whom have hacked about in the bushes, but produced nothing to show for their labors except a covey of unappealing conjectures and misconceptions. To produce the results desired, we should, once again, abandon the conventional methods of attack, all of which would seem to be of little avail, and devise for our purpose some unconventional tool. The one I would propose concerns the use of a third text of known date and provenance, deriving independently from and therefore identifying the first of the several editions under consideration, yet, paradoxically, extraneous to these editions, to their printer, and to the author, and thus, in a strict sense, of no editorial or bibliographical significance whatever. This anomalous text is that provided by the literary reviews which, beginning with those to be found in the early numbers of the Gentleman's Magazine, 15a usually appear shortly after the publication of the first edition and occasionally cite passages of considerable length "for the interest of their readers," and now, we may say, for our interest too. When the readings in the abstracts are collated with those in the indeterminate editions they will, of course, collate only with those in the text from which they were copied, and thus establish the priority of that edition in the sequence. It is rather surprising that evidence so abundantly available in the periodicals should be so rarely employed. In fact, so far as I can recall, only one scholar, Austin Dobson, has ever resorted to the reviews for the purpose I recommend, and on that occasion—some thirty years before the discovery of the printer's ledger confirmed his decision—he was able to demonstrate by a simple collation that, contrary to normal expectation, the expurgated version of Fielding's Voyage to Lisbon (1755) was issued prior to the one with the original text. 16 Of the many books which can be ordered through reference to the journal readings, several may be mentioned here. The first, Smollett's Humphry Clinker (1771), has long confounded every attempt at analysis. For the last twenty-five years a succession of bibliographers have undertaken the disheartening task of collating the 800 pages in this novel, amassed reams of worthless notes, and eventually confessed their failure to establish the precedence of the editions. 17 For this, as for numerous other works, a mixture of corrupted and corrected readings precludes a demonstration of priority. Undoubtedly, any approach to a solution in the case of Humphry Clinker has been somewhat impeded by an uncertainty as to the number of existing variants. Once the true editions are disengaged from sophisticated copies, variant states, and "ghosts," all of which have crept into the discussion of this riddle, it will be noted that there are, essentially, four distinct settings: Volume I Edition Title-page Press figures 18 A 1671 Throughout B 1671 or 1771 Only in gathering M C 1772 2d ed None D 1771 2d ed None Now between June 18, 1771, the date of original publication, either for A or for B, and September 1, the approximate date that work was completed on the alternate "first edition," a total of seventy-four pages from the novel were reprinted in four journals, The London Magazine, The Gentleman's Magazine, The Critical Review , and The Weekly Magazine, or Edinburgh Amusement . 19 As these reprinted pages represent 138 readings, all differing from those in B, and all agreeing with those in A, the conclusion follows that A is unmistakably the first of the two editions. With the order of these determined, the relationship of all texts, complete and abstracted, may be represented in the stemma: Thus after years of misdirected activity, a little effort, very little, has here provided a certain decision. No less certain are the results to be obtained by the use of figures and reviews, independently or together, in the reconsideration of problems already known and decided. Two instances may be cited, one reported within the past several months, one on record for the last twenty years, both entertaining versions of the kind, number, and order of variants, and both entirely contrary to fact. The first, appearing in the latest catalogue issued by Peter Murray Hill, is a brief notice of The Life of David Hume, Esq . (1777) — a book about which Millar has given us ample warning. Concerning this, Hill reports two "issues," with the first containing a reading "himself" and the second containing the reading supposedly corrected to "myself." Actually these are not "issues," as they are called, or states, as we might infer from the description, but separate editions, of which the figures indicate different settings of type and the reviews a different order of publication. 20 For the second instance, Edward Moore's periodical, The World (1753-56), the current explanation is as simple as the one I have just refuted, but the circumstances of printing somewhat more complex. In J. H. Caskey's account we are informed that there were, apparently, two simultaneous "issues" of every one of the 209 numbers. 21 First, it would seem, came the issue bearing a vignette, and then, set from proof-sheets of this, the one containing a headpiece of printers' ornaments. Though the reasons for this facile hypothesis are not made explicit, they seem to rest on a reference to the fact that 2500 copies were required of some numbers. Perhaps it was thought that Robert Dodsley, the publisher, needed to have two settings for an impression running over the limit established by regulation, or that two were necessary in order to shorten the time at press. From the point of view of those dealing with the literature of the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries, either explanation would appear to be plausible. From our vantage ground in the eighteenth, both must be considered irrelevant. The size of an impression was certainly not determined, at this time, by directives of the Stationers' Company. That these had long since become inoperative is attested by the printers' own accounts: William Woodfall cast off 4500 copies of Edward and Eleanora (1739); Samuel Richardson, 2500 of The Centaur Not Fabulous , third edition (1755); William Strahan, 3000 of Tom Jones, third edition (1749), 3500 of the fourth edition (1750), 5000 of Amelia (1752); 22 and each of these editions, I am satisfied, is of a single impression. Nor can it be argued that there was insufficient time to produce an issue of The World from one setting of type. If two presses were used for the full sheet, one for printing, the other for perfecting, and a third press for the half-sheet, even as many as 2500 copies could be easily completed within three days, well within the schedule for a weekly paper. With the liberty and the time to do what he pleased, the publisher would hardly put himself to the expense of a second, unnecessary setting at the time of publication. The only reasonable explanation therefore seems to be that the variant "issue" was set at some time after publication to meet an unexpected demand for certain numbers. If the variants are, thus, nothing more than occasional reprints, they should occur irregularly in the sequence of numbers and not, as the previous hypothesis would require, in every number. What, then, is the situation, and to what extent may it be explained by the usual method of analysis? Examination discloses that, among the copies I have examined, the variants are not precisely two to a number, nor can they be considered as "issues," nor were they printed in the sequence described. From the 19th to the 209th and last, all numbers bear the vignette. Among the first eighteen numbers one encounters the usual disorder in what is assumed to be entirely regular: three editions of the first and second numbers, two from the fourth through the eleventh, one from the twelfth to the seventeenth, and two of the eighteenth. A distinguishing characteristic of some of these editions is the headpiece, of which there are, not two, but three variants: A Five rows of ornaments B Vignette of author at his desk C The same vignette, broken diagonally across the center of the block Whenever one copy differs from another in any of these respects it also differs in setting. And whenever the settings B and C are found for the same number of the periodical, we may assume from the evidence of the fractured block that C was printed at a later date than B. This date is fixed by the progressive deterioration of the vignette in the numbers which exist as a single edition. From the 19th to the 23rd number the block is sound; from the 24th to the 87th it is broken in one place, as in variant C; and beginning with some copies of the 88th number a second break appears. Thus the C edition of the earlier numbers, though dated January, 1753, must have been printed after June 7 of that year, the date of the 23rd number, and before September 5, 1754, the date of the 88th. Whereas B and C have the vignette in common, a collation of the readings indicates that they are separated by an intermediate text A without vignette. The precise relationship of the three editions, wherever they occur in the periodical, therefore corresponds to one of these three stemma: Further than this we cannot proceed by the critical method, for the potentialities of that method have now been exhausted. But if we choose to apply collateral evidence, a second series of texts is made available, and the analysis can then continue to a conclusion. These texts, present in The London Magazine, The Monthly Review, The Scots Magazine , and The Universal Magazine , 23 abstract readings from the first two numbers of the periodical. Among the readings in the several editions of the first number the variants are accidental, amounting to a few changes in capitalization. Among those of the second, however, the variation is substantial: Reading Editions Reviews 7,8 shine, but A C MR SM shine but B 8,29 nothing to say A C MR SM not a word to say B 10,32 absence; A B MR SM LM UM absence: C A collation of the seven texts now at our disposal demonstrates the literal sequence of the three editions to be of the order A-B for the one, A-C for the other. The chronological sequence, where C with the broken vignette follows the unbroken B, is therefore: This determination of the priority and relationship among the three editions of one number of The World establishes a reasonable presumption for a similar arrangement of the editions in others. Without reference to the reviews any determination, even for one number, is impossible. From the evidence adduced in this and the preceding examples I would suggest that by one method or another, and sometimes by these methods alone, we are now in a position to discover and decide problems presently unknown or unresolved. To such a declaration it is hardly necessary to add that these several techniques do not constitute a panacea for all of the duplications and disorders to be encountered in eighteenth-century literature. Some books requiring differentiation are unfigured, figured in uninformative patterns, or, in rare instances, exactly reiterated in their figures. Some requiring arrangement are unreviewed, reviewed by a synopsis not subject to collation, or cited in portions where there are only a few or no discrepancies. For these exceptional cases other procedures must be found, or the project abandoned as insolvable. For all except these, however, the methodology now available will facilitate a solution to any problem concerning the discrimination, description, and classification of variants. Even in these elementary, though fundamental preliminaries to editorial endeavor there is much to do in the eighteenth century, and much of what has been attempted must be done again.</field>

Greig (1932), II, 354. 1a As this goes to press still another reason is suggested by the recollection that many of the contributors to the 5th and 6th volumes of Dodsley's Collection of Poems by Several Hands were much displeased by his production, some insisting that their material was included without their consent, others that what they had entered must be extensively revised in a second edition. Faced with these protests and demands, Dodsley surreptitiously published another uncorrected edition so much like the first as to remain undetected then and thereafter. [See my account forthcoming in BSA .] Through this stategem he—and, I would suspect, many others—easily avoided considerable expense, not only in extra pay to the compositors for work from manuscript, but in royalties to the authors, who were generally entitled then, as now, to some of the proceeds from a revised edition. 2 The ratio of size of issue to cost of paper and printing is illustrated in the following data: copies paper cost &amp; percentage printing cost &amp; percentage 500 £ 7 8 10½ 42.1 £ 11 0 6 57.9 750 11 15 9 46.2 14 8 0 53.8 1500 72 0 0 63.7 41 2 0 36.3 Data computed from statistics for Gibbon's Vindication of the History (1st and 2d eds) and Smollett's Humphry Clinker (ed. identified as "B" in this paper), as cited by George K.

Just recently I discovered, in what appeared to be a first edition of the Magazine, a reference in the February 1733 number to a citation in a number issued in the following year. When the alteration involves nothing more than this, the reprint may still be used as an index to the princeps of a book, since new errors would derive independently of the texts. But when the reprint substitutes one passage for another—one perhaps in greater esteem than the one originally printed—the replacement may originate in a text later than the first edition. The periodicals should therefore be used with some discretion. 16 Henry Fielding, The Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon , ed. Austin Dobson (1892), pp. v-xii. J.

Since Dr. Newman preferred to undertake this investigation without assistance and to disregard the findings incorporated in my thesis, his analysis, now published in BSA, XLIV (1950), 340-371, fails to supply all that the bibliographer should know concerning the location of copies, discrepancies in the make-up of the title-pages for the three volumes of each edition, variant states, an occasional reimpression, collateral evidence for the priority of variants, and the case for a pirated edition (D in the above stemma, corresponding to C in Dr. Newman's account).

      <field name="heading_text">Watermarks Are Twins by Allan H. Stevenson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the first place, there is no such thing as a duplicate . Of course not. Can you print two copies on the same paper? Then, so far as the paper itself and the watermarks are subjects of enquiry, "duplicates" may be astoundingly different.— Falconer Madan before the Bibliographical Society (1911) . 1 MOST EARLY BOOKS ARE PRINTED ON A VARIETY of papers. They contain a number of different watermarks. Though now and then a small volume has "one mark throughout," and a tall folio shows a single stock of fine paper, the majority of books are not so consistent. Often a well-printed folio, starting out with a run of grape paper (say), shifts to crown or fleur-de-lis paper by the time it reaches its second alphabet. In other folios, no less proud ones, the preliminaries alone disclose several marks, and the text a dozen or sixteen more, with alternation of marks through successive sheets. And, as for quartos, the next play one leafs through may offer an assortment of seven watermarks within eleven sheets. Those who have examined the papermarks in early books know these things are so. 2 Indeed, mixed watermarks began with the Gutenberg Bible; 3 and they persisted through the Renaissance into the eighteenth century, as a normal feature of books printed on handmade paper. A volume printed by Wynkyn de Worde, the Vitas Patrum of 1495, is said to contain nearly fifty different marks. 4 There have been explanations. Sometimes (it has been said) printers bought cheap job lots of paper. 5 Such an explanation neatly fits the bibliographically famous Shakespearian quartos of 1619. Sir Walter Greg showed, in 1908, that these nine quartos contain at least twenty-seven watermarks, so distributed as to prove all were printed in one year, though their imprints read variously "1600," "1608," and "1619." 6 All printed by Jaggard for Pavier. In examining four sets of these quartos, Greg found, to be sure, just one pot watermark throughout the two Contention plays (dated 1619), yet no less than fifteen marks—pots, croziers, fleurs-de-lis—in the four copies of King Lear (falsely dated 1608); and in a single copy—the Garrick-British Museum copy—of The Merchant of Venice (misdated 1600) eight or nine different marks within its ten sheets. 7 Dr. Greg then doubted that similar wild mixtures were likely to occur elsewhere; and they are indeed rare; but I have found them in a group of plays by Fletcher and Shirley emanating from the same printing-house in the Barbican, with the imprint of Thomas Cotes, a score of years later. 8 As for the job-lot hypothesis, it remains plausible, but it has not been proved, and may not be necessary to account for the multiplicity of marks. The moderate mixture of papers generally found in books allows a sui generis explanation. It lies in the manner in which paper was manufactured, packed in quires and reams, gathered by factors into bales, transported by waggon or boat, and shelved in warehouses. As a generalized procedure is hard to visualize, let us think in terms of books printed in England in the seventeenth century—though the implications extend beyond these limits of time and place. For in the seventeenth century the ordinary papers used in English books came mainly from just across the Channel, from Normandy and Brittany. 9 The rushing streams near such towns as Vire, Sourdeval, Fougères, Morlaix turned the wheels of a host of papermills, small family usines, mostly, with just one vat to dip paper-moulds in, and a small output daily. 10 Though little is known of his operations, a marchand papetier or factor seems to have bought up (weekly, say) the paper from various mills in a district. 11 As sometimes many mills were clustered along one stream 12 and may have been served by the same maker of moulds, we find here a reasonable explanation of the diversity of marks in books and also of the similarity of design often seen in a sequence of such marks. Paper watermarked with the arms of France and Navarre may appear in a series of sheets, all of one pattern but with the labels of various papermakers attached. 13 When reams and bales of paper stood on the wharves at Caen or Morlaix or Rochelle, 14 we may suppose they had been sorted rather according to size and quality than according to make and mark. And no doubt the piling into cargo boats, the unloading at London, the stacking in the warehouse of the London paper merchant and later on the shelves of the printer he sold paper to—all this handling contributed to the mixture of papers we find in books. And much might happen in laying out tokens of paper for the presses. All in all, it is hardly surprising there were few books consistent in their paper, hardly surprising that sometimes reams of differently marked papers were used in the printing of individual edition-sheets. 15 Yet this is not all. Within the reams themselves the paper was in a sense consistent. But a subtle variation occurred, due to the number of moulds, and occasionally the number of vats, used in its making. Students of the history of paper know that pairs of moulds were used in its manufacture. Regularly, if not inevitably, two similar moulds were employed together, in all mills, in the making of all sizes and qualities of paper. It is so today for homemade paper. 16 The vatman, after placing the deckle, 17 plunges a mould into his tub of paper pulp, expertly takes up just enough of the paste or allows the excess to run over the farther edge, removes the deckle, and passes the mould along the stay 18 to his helper. The coucher, after allowing the sheet to dry a moment, turns it out on the felt or woolen on top of the post 19 he is building, puts the mould on the bridge, 20 and presently lays another felt for the following sheet. Meanwhile, the vatman has taken up a second mould, added the deckle, and is forming the next sheet as he formed the first. The process goes on all day, the vatman passing the mould with the newly made sheet to the coucher, and the coucher returning the companion mould empty to the vatman. A good team at the vat and felts work rhythmically and efficiently at their equal jobs, and produce up to eight reams of paper a day. 21 From time to time the layboy removes the posts of felts and paper to the paper press. 22 Documentary and material evidence shows that moulds were made and used in pairs from at least the early seventeenth century. Louis Le Clert, citing records of the region of Troyes in Champagne, tells us that "Dans l'inventaire après décès de dame Jeanne Delalne, . . . dressé en juin 1614, il est fait mention de 'deux paires de formes servant á faire papier. . . .'" 23 Alexandre Nicolaï, in discussing the inspectors who visited papeteries to secure conformance with the Tariff of 1739, publishes several reports that mention pairs of moulds. For instance, at Creysse (near Bergerac) in Périgord, Inspector Marouze found "dans un moulin exploité par le Sieur Jardel . . . trois paires de formes avec leurs couvertes dont il y en a une paire marqué aux Armes d'Amsterdam , une autre marquée aux OOO , et une autre paire marquée à la fleur de lys , qui ont été poinçonnées comme conformes." 24 Dard Hunter quotes a bill for moulds bought of Peter Wynne in London in August 1783 for Mark Willcox, the papermaker of Ivy Mills, Chester, Pennsylvania. It lists "1 Pair Double Fools Cap Paper Moulds" at £5 5s and "1 Pair Double Post Do " at £5. 25 And Alfred Schulte, in summing up certain results of German research, notes that "Im Jahre 1600 hatte die Oberfichtenmühle 2 Paar Formen, 1602 Doos 37 Paar, 1753 Röthenbach bei St. Wolfgang 11 Paar, 1839 Fischlaken bei Werden 14 Paar (darunter 2 Paar Doppelformen)." 26 Dard Hunter informs me that the Paper Museum at Cambridge, Massachusetts contains "a good many pairs of European moulds" with their attendant deckles; and I understand there are similar pairs in the Gutenberg Museum at Mainz. The double moulds ( Doppelformen ) or divided moulds mentioned above were a development of the eighteenth century, in which two moulds usually of small format (such as foolscap) were placed side by side, so that a skilled vatman might dip two sheets at a time. Schulte has discussed their use in Germany, 27 Povey and Foster their probable use in England from 1709 or earlier, 28 and Labarre, with excellent illustrations, a well-preserved double mould of Honig &amp; Zoon, famous Dutch papermakers. 29 Naturally, the companion sheets of such a mould exhibit similar watermarks, as Schulte's and Labarre's illustrations show. But double moulds themselves were made and used in pairs, as we can see from the Willcox purchase of 1783. Although some early accounts of papermaking make no mention of pairs of moulds, the standard accounts, of course, do. Thus, La Lande in his Art de faire le papier (Paris, 1761), the authoritative voice of the eighteenth century, remarks: Une seule couverture suffit pour les deux formes qu'on emploie dans le travail du papier; car . . . l'une des deux formes est toujours découverte au moment où l'autre se plonge dans la cuve avec sa couverture . And later in describing the process: Le Plongeur, en ôtant la couverture de dessus cette première forme, la place tout de suite sur la seconde forme, qu'on lui donne pour la plonger à son tour. . . . le Coucheur releve sa forme, en commencement par la bonne rive; il la rend au Plongeur aussi nette qu'avant qu'elle eût été plongée, &amp; il trouve sur le trapan de cuve une seconde feuille à coucher qui a été formée pendant qu'il couchoit la première, &amp; qu'il releve en passant, avant que d'étendre le feutre. Ainsi l'on voit, qu'au moyen de deux formes qui sont toujours en mouvement, il n'y a point de temps perdu: pendant qu'une forme se plonge, l'autre se couche; quand le Plongeur passe une forme au Coucheur, il en reçoit une autre qui est vuide, sur laquelle il pose la couverture qu'il retire de dessus la première, &amp; il plonge de nouveau. 30 La Lande offers a series of valuable plates, among which no. XI pictures a vatman dipping one forme while his coucher is releasing a sheet from the other; and another pair of moulds is seen in the foreground. This plate has been reproduced by Renker. 31 Hunter has brought together several instructive pictures of papermaking in which the two moulds in use can plainly be seen. 32 Though historians of paper have thus stressed the fact of companion moulds, not much attention has been paid to the companion watermarks produced by such moulds. (Are they identical? Are they different?) Relatively few collectors have taken note of them; and bibliographers, at least in the English-speaking world, have seemed oblivious of them. A reason perhaps is that McKerrow, in the bibliographer's bible, makes no mention of pairs of moulds, though he gives a short description of papermaking. 33 Inasmuch as bibliographers in their innocence commonly assume that the papermarks in a quire or ream are invariant and indistinguishable, what follows has a raison d'être —and illustrations. Watermarks result from designs made of wire and attached to the moulds. Le Clert points out that "La confection des formes était une industrie spéciale exercée par les formiers ou formaires ." 34 That is, skilled artisans set up as makers of moulds and supplied the needs of a papermaking region. Less often they were papermakers themselves. 35 An examination of old moulds, such as those at the Dard Hunter Paper Museum, leaves little doubt that European mould-makers came to be exceedingly clever workmen, seasoning the wood and securing the laid wires and buttressing the chain wires as they did. 36 They fashioned the watermark patterns out of brass wire and sewed them to the moulds with finer wire. 37 Though the ordinary wireform was not a work of art, particularly after a period of use, it was sufficient and not unattractive; and it was often so neatly duplicated as to deceive students into supposing that companion marks are the same marks. Thus cataloguers of incunabula or Renaissance books who state categorically "This copy has the same watermark throughout" are usually, if not invariably, wrong. The maker of moulds can hardly have intended to deceive anyone. It was enough if a pair of moulds resembled each other so closely that the vatman would always know them for mates. What was important was that the formier should cut the mould frames precisely alike, so that the single deckle would fit them both neatly. But the twin watermarks might vary somewhat in height or position or details of design without affecting the certitude of their belonging together. Indeed, as we shall see, the mould-maker must sometimes have intended a distinction, as when he put the handle of a pot once on the left, once on the right. Some more patent differences may have resulted from two mould-makers working together, or from a papermaker improvising a filigree in imitation of one that was lost. Even when a skilled artisan took special pains with moulds for fine paper (as sometimes he did), the complexity of the design, differences in chains and lettering, and wear of the wireforms in use prevented one watermark from being or continuing to be a replica of the other. Standardization was not yet. With good sight, undiffused light, and a millimeter scale, the bibliographer today can train himself to distinguish the watermarks from companion moulds, except where heavy print or close binding serve to defeat him. Though some have not pondered his words, Briquet spoke clearly on these matters, out of years of experience: . . . chacun sait que dans l'ancienne manière de faire le papier on se servait de deux moules ou formes que l'ouvrier plongeait alternativement dans la pâte. Le papier produit, portait donc par parts égales l'empreinte de chacune des formes employées et ce mélange se voit dans chaque rame et dans chaque main de ce papier. Ces deux variétés du filigrane sont parfois identiques au point qu'on ne les distingue que par la place un peu différente que chacune d'elles occupe sur la feuille de papier. Parfois les deux variétés sont divergentes, voy. coupe (n os 4542 et 4543), couronne (n os 4791 et 4792), croix grecque (n os 5525 et 5526); le plus souvent elles sont similaires n'offrant entre elles que des différences légères de forme ou de dimension, voy. pot (n os 12.893 et 12.894), serpent (n os 13.801 et 13.802), tête de boeuf (n os 14.388 et 14.389). 38 If perchance the term filigrane identique is slightly misleading, this is the lesson of the master, and the reader would do well to examine the indicated pairs of marks before entering the forest. It is convenient to refer to Briquet's several categories of degree as twin watermarks, a term suggesting either identical or ordinary pairs of twins. The term companion watermarks also has useful connotations. But for purposes of efficient analysis and description, I have found it necessary to observe certain points of difference which recur in twin watermarks. Among useful points of difference are these: 1) Difference of mould-end. Often the pairs of marks appear in different halves of their respective moulds and the sheets of paper made on them: variant a centered in the left halfsheet, b in the right halfsheet. Actually, this is mainly an inference from the fact that some marks read in and some read out . Frequently the inference may be checked by the indentations made by the watermark or chain wires. Where these are clear, it appears that commonly, if not normally, the lettering on the mould itself was reversed, as in typography; that is, a watermark in a left halfsheet with left-to-right lettering usually was impressed by a wireform with right-to-left lettering in the right half of the mould; for the indented side or "smooth" side is obviously the mould side of the paper. Of course, there are exceptions, as when a label was turned and resewn non-reversed, In ambiguous or uncertain cases the Difference may be called one of in and out. 2) Difference of chain-position. Sometimes a mark fits neatly between the chains while its twin does not. Or a small mark is centered in one instance but touches a chain in the other. Some pairs are centered on a chain, with the line cutting through at slightly different points. A few are sewn to a chain or between chains that do not correspond to those of the companion mould, the count being different from the end-chain or deckle, so that they appear higher or lower in a quarto fold. We may call a chain that splits a watermark its center chain , and those that it falls between or that cut its edges its attendant chains or outer and inner chains . 3) Difference of chain-space or chain-pattern. When the attendant chains vary as much as 2 mm. in their distance from each other, this often is the easiest means of telling the twins apart. A smaller variation, though usable, may prove elusive, because of paper shrinkage or vagaries in the parallelism of the line. Differences of as much as 4 mm. occur. Actually, the chain-structure of two handmade moulds will never be precisely alike; thus remote chains are sometimes as useful as near ones, if they differ markedly in relative position or form. Occasionally an end-chain or other margin-chain has a wobble or a break that may be seen at a glance. 4) Difference of slant. At least one of the marks has not been sewn to the mould in an upright position and leans to right or left. Or an important part has been bent. In doubtful cases it is wise to measure upper and lower distances from the nearest chains; particularly in quartos, where one sees but part of the watermark at a time and may be uncertain which side of the paper one is looking at. 5) Difference of reversed pattern. The mould-maker has made one mark the reverse or mirror-image of the other, except for names and initials. In the Arms of France and Navarre, for instance, Navarre may be first on the left, then on the right, with respect to the lettering below. This makes a pretty distinction, which seems to have been intentional on the part of some mould-makers. 6) Difference of label. One mark carries a "full name", the other mere initials or a name-abbreviation: as DVAVLEGARD and DVG. Or one may have initials, the other none. Or a name may appear in two spellings. The labels themselves may have different shapes. And occasionally one of the labels gets inverted or attached to the wrong end of a grape or shield watermark. 7) Difference of countermark. Countermarks are of course the smaller marks that appear opposite the main marks in the other half of the mould or sheet; they are common after 1650 or so. When they contain lettering, they vary much as labels do. Sometimes one of the countermarks has fallen out of its mould. Frequently, though the mould-maker has made the main marks "identical," he has taken less trouble with the countermark letters and has spaced them differently. And one set of countermark letters may be reversed or even inverted in respect to the main mark. Those countermarks that are letterless differ in detail or position as other marks do. 8) Difference of distinctive detail. One mark has an element of design not found in the other. A pot may have a fleur-de-lis within its base, its companion none. One bunch of grapes may have a curved stem, the other a comparatively straight one. Such differences may have been original or consequent to use. It was easy for separately attached bits of the design to break off or drop out during the process of papermaking or the brushing or cleaning of moulds after use. 9) Difference of sewing. Particularly in early watermarks, where heavy sewing-wire was used, the sewing marks can be seen. These are what Sotheby calls dots . 39 Their differences of position may serve to distinguish nearly identical marks. When the wire-forms came loose, then arose Differences of resewing. In such cases the dots often are plainer, especially if linen thread has been used in temporary replacement; and the sewings may appear in new places. At this same time the watermark itself may have been moved, so that it reappears between wider chains (say) or even in the other half of the mould. 10) Difference of distortion. Parts of the design have been bent out of position. This ugliness is less often due to malformation than to deterioration. The wireforms commonly went to pieces before the moulds to which they were attached. 40 They came partly unsewn, at one or more points. The result was sprung wires, bent wires, shifts in position—and increased differentiation from the twin mark. The wires might be further bent in resewing. Certain of these distortions in the life-history of watermarks will be illustrated. The awkward thing is that the shape of a mark may change in some difficult-to-describe particular while the detective pursues it from gathering to gathering of a pompous folio. Naturally, such changes limit the certainty of recognition when he meets the mark in another book. These ten points of difference, closely observed, serve to train the bibliographical eye. Those points having to do with chains are perhaps the most helpful (despite the vagaries of resewing), and the student soon learns the advantage of measuring the chainspaces as part of the routine of examination. Distances of key points from the attendant chains often repay measurement, though much measuring wastes time. Slight differences in the overall size of a watermark prove less useful than differences of two or five millimeters in a part, for these the eye can judge. The filigranist will learn not to assume while looking at one twin what the main point of difference is likely to be: both twins may be disfigured by a harelip and yet differ markedly in some unexpected detail. In note-taking it is important to follow a neat, consistent practice, to avoid ambiguity and differences that are not differences. Assuming that papermarks appear "normally" in the left halfsheet, we may agree to record measurements away from the deckle and in to the center of the sheet, that is towards the folio fold or the quarto headlines, or else in the direction of the lettering or the normal arrangement of a coat of arms, though then we have to note the direction as out . I have adopted a system of using square brackets to enclose the breadth of a significant detail or of a whole design, and vertical lines (or typewriter colons) at need to show the relevant position of chains; and I find this system avoids later misinterpretation of notes. Thus the crescent or fleuron in the superstructure of a pot may measure :3[13]5: or, more simply, 3[13]5—which means that the part is 13 mm. wide, centered between chains 21 mm. apart, 3 mm. from its outer chain and 5 from its inner chain (unless we are reading out with the lettering). It may be useful to insert the name of the part: 3[Crescent 13]5. Similarly, [4:3] or 4:3 indicates a detail split by a chain; and [2:20:22:2]-out measures a shield extending over chain-spaces of 20 and 22 mm., and 2 mm. on either side of them, reading towards the deckle. When the edges of the mark coincide with chains, the measures can be set down as [:20:22:] or o[20:22]o or even [20:22]—if the missing detail is understood. [Fl 17:23:] or 5[Fl 17:23]o describes a royal fleur-de-lis 40 mm. across its petals, cut left of center by one chain, and just touching its inner chain. Luckily, most papermarks appear upright on or between chains and so may readily be measured consistently in one direction, across the chains, in both folios and quartos. 41 The student may observe examples or possible examples of twin watermarks in various published collections, though the collector himself may not have recognized their nature. Briquet, as we have seen, points out examples of filigranes similarires and filigranes divergentes . 42 Curiously, one of the earliest writers on the subject of watermarks understood their basic nature better than some later men. Though Samuel Leigh Sotheby may not have inspected papermoulds, his observant eye had noted that watermarks in incunabula turn up in twos and multiples of two: The Sieves appear to have been procured either in pairs, fours, sixes, eights, or twelves, and about the centre of each, prior to its being used, the watermark was fastened, by the workman of the paper-maker, on the inside of the form, between the upright or cross-wires . . .; an operation which, it is almost needless to observe, can never be so accurately executed as not to present some shades of difference every time, even when it has to be repeated with the same identical instrument; not to speak of the difference that must exist when the duplicates are employed. Accordingly, it is only by comparing them together, with reference to this disposition of their component parts, that their actual differences can be satisfactorily determined. Thus, when the tracing of one is placed over the fac-simile of another of the same device, no difference is frequently discernible, except in its position with regard to the upright or cross-wires, being in some more oblique, or at a greater distance, than in others; a difference sufficient, however, to show that the sheets of paper were not made from the same sieve. 43 Except for the assumption that all the moulds were used in one mill, one or two misconceptions concerning the affixing of watermarks, and an overstatement of their similarity, this is all very good; and it is surprising that such remarks, published in 1858, have so little influenced collectors and bibliographers. Briquet, Weiss, Schulte, and Dard Hunter have added something to the subject; but Ataide e Melo, Churchill, Nicolaï, and Heawood (among collectors) have shown little awareness of this thing which is part of the essential nature of watermarks. Heawood, to be sure, frequently reproduces a number of marks from one volume, and sometimes adds a variant detail or countermark "from another sheet," without noting their implications, yet thus furnishes the clue to companion marks, particularly of the seventeenth century. 44 However, it is only Sotheby who sets a considerable number of pairs of marks (of the fifteenth century) side by side. 45 Schulte shows how such twins became quadruplets in the double moulds of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. 46 And Dard Hunter notices not merely a variant bull's head in the Gutenberg Bible, but several pairs among American watermarks. 47 Recently in the Gutenberg Jahrbuch 1950 , 48 through photographic illustration of the "initial watermark of the Craig and Parkers mill, the earliest paper mill in Kentucky," he has shown that this mark is twins. 49 And now in his magnificent work on Papermaking by Hand in America (Chillicothe, 1950) he publishes facsimiles within handmade paper of the same pair of Kentucky moulds (in laid paper) and of two pairs of early Ohio moulds (in wove paper). 50 The plates accompanying the present article offer simple examples of twin watermarks, with a few that lead to complications. Among those photographed, one pair are taken from a mid-sixteenth-century manuscript, three from endpapers removed from seventeenth-century bindings, two from a mid-seventeenth-century folio with plates, and two from a royal writing-book resplendent with the watermarked arms of King William and Queen Anne. 51 The marks as reproduced may vary slightly from their natural size. During the discussion the reader needs to keep in mind pictures of the old moulds, such as those illustrated by Clapperton, Hunter, and Degaast. 52 The chains ran the short way of the mould, so as not to impede surplus pulp from falling over the edge away from the vatman, and commonly produced chainlines in the paper from 17 to 25 mm. (or ¾ to 1 inch) apart. 53 Though extant moulds show the main watermark centered in either half, with the countermark similarly placed in the opposite half, my notes suggest that in the period before countermarks the watermark was oftener on the right side of the mould, and thus in the left halfsheet of the paper, reading in; except that certain seventeenth-century mould-makers put one mark of a pair on the left and one on the right. The point is worth further study. It is not easy to be certain in an individual case, if the indentations are not clear, for some marks no doubt had their lettering left to right on the mould. 54 SHIELD: STARS DIVIDED PER BEND. MS Volume of Property Records, Langenzerdorf, Austria, 1556-1738. 4°. Jirgal. Fig. 1. The manuscript, written in various German hands, deals with property-holdings at a village near Vienna. The first entries are dated 1556. Sixty-nine leaves of script (some crossed out) are followed by eighty or so blank leaves, and a few apparently have been lost. The paper is coarse, rough, slightly sized, with leaves measuring 7¾ x 6 inches (198 x 154 mm.). The watermark, as the illustration shows, is a small shield of about 18 x 16 mm. centered between chainlines 26-27 mm. apart. There are two varieties, and they may be distinguished at a glance. Variant a slants to the right, and variant b to the left, at angles of about 80°; and further particularization is unnecessary. As there are no other marks in the volume, it is instructive to note how many instances of each variant there are. Expectations are neatly satisfied: a occurs 17 times and b 16 times. The arms, two six-pointed stars separated per bend, appear to be those of Kaufbeuren (see Heawood, 490, 509), a city fifty or so miles southwest of Munich. Luckily the mark occurs just above the middle of the sheet (higher in variant a ) and is not caught in the quarto fold. Judging by the position of the end-wires or tranchefiles , 55 along with the indentations, the two variants were situated in the opposite halves of their respective moulds, non-reversed. POT P LEGRAND. Endpapers, c. ?1660. 4°. AHS (my copy). Fig. 2. The pot watermark, so common in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, underwent a thousand permutations. Here is a style not illustrated in Heawood, nor elsewhere, apparently. Many a Norman pot is topped by a crescent and fleuron, has five lobes with alternate trefoils and single balls, has bars across its bowl and a bell-shaped base; but the name-label below is certainly rare, though it occurs often enough in grape, shield, and fleur-de-lis marks. The handle is more commonly on the left; and it is the handle here that readily distinguishes the twin variants. In variant a the lower part of the handle curls neatly 2 mm. within the attendant chain, whereas in b it is broken or sprung and extends 3 mm. across the line. A short examination reveals other differences. Though both pots measure 81 x 46 and are nicely centered on a chain, a 's chain-spaces are 20.5:20.5 and b 's 19.5:19.5. The crescent in a is relatively open and marred by a loose sewing-wire, and measures 5:4. That in b is more circular and measures 4:5. The foliage on a measures 7[13:14]6 and the more luxuriant flowering on b 4[15:16]3. Several differences show up in the lettering: b being distinguished by a label that touches the left chain and is cut by the right chain along the right of the N. In checking pot watermarks in quartos, it is important to note points of difference in both halves of the mark. I am uncertain on which side the deckle was in this instance. The label P. LEGRAND gives us the name of a papermaker, presumably Norman, not mentioned by Heawood or Bourde de la Rogerie. 56 FOOLSCAP &amp; COUNTERMARK MPX. Endpapers, c. 1688. 2°. AHS. Fig. 3. This pair of foolscap watermarks is such as to delight a small boy, if not a bibliographer. For watermarks are not lacking in humor. In variant a the Fool has thrust his long nose up to a chainline; in b he has pushed it quite 4 mm. over. Though this may be difference enough for all parties concerned, the pair illustrate several other points of difference. Fool a (92 x 58) has the five (Norman) points of his coat well separated, though the back one is squeezed and others are bent; while Fool b (94 x 58) has two of his points hanging together so that a bell touches the reversed 4 below. Where Fool a is a roundhead, b is a flathead with a larger cephalic index. The main chain-spaces of a measure 22:25 in , those of b 24:23.5; and the mid-chain of a splits one of the three balls, while that of b merely touches it. Each of these Fools is accompanied by a countermark, a label reading MPX, and these labels are also readily distinguishable. Countermark a (11 x 33) is cut by a chain 16:17 out, along the back of the P; and b (10 x 34) is cut 16:18 between the M and P. In both endpaper sheets the watermark appears in the left leaf and the countermark in the right, and the leaves measure 11⅞ x 8⅛" (301 x 208 mm.), with some deckle remaining at the fore-edges. According to Heawood, the initials MPX stand for M. Pallix, apparently a Norman papermaker of the latter part of the century. 57 Though the endpapers are undated, I note a similar fool with countermark MPX in a Sanderson pamphlet of 1688, 58 and Heawood points out another in the Paradise Lost of 1695. 59 But recently I have come upon the identical Flathead Fool of Fig. 3 b in The Historical and Chronological Theatre of Christopher Helvicus (M. Flesher, 1687), ICU copy, sheet S. He is at all points the same, except that the second point of his coat has not yet fallen against the front of the figure 4. The ICN copy has a quite different Pudding-faced Fool (with countermark MPX) in the same sheet. SHIELD FM &amp; THREE LIONS. Endpapers, c. 1610. 2°. AHS. Fig. 4. The crowned shield with quarterly a fess and three lions is one of the more intriguing of French marks. Though the design may have come out of the Rhine country, 60 the style here is certainly French. The date 1610 sometimes found in the base of the shield may denote the first regnal year of Louis XIII. Other shields of the time have Norman name-abbreviations within the fess, but the initials FM have not been identified. The oddest thing about the present pair is—what the reader will have seen at once—the reversed date of variant b . Though the initials appear in a customary position in the first quarter, and the lions ramp regularly to the left, the year has got in backwards, except for the numeral 6. 61 The marks are not among the prettiest examples of the mould-maker's art, for they have suffered some deterioration, but they well illustrate common features of ècu watermarks, such as the crown with fleur-de-lis, "horns," and band of annulets, the spear-rests on either side, and the conventionalized toison d'or below. Such complex designs invite differences. Shield a (83 x 48) is elongated and well centered on a line between spaces 19:20. Shield b (81 x 54) has its fleur-de-lis spread between chains 20 mm. apart. Shield a has a deeper fess and taller letters, and has lost the outer wire from its second quarter. Shield b has extended horns, a tailless lion in its second quarter, and a smaller sheepskin below. And so on. The differences provide practice in observation. As these endpapers have been cut down, it is uncertain whether the shields are from left or right halves of their moulds. 62 We shall have more lions anon. ARMS OF KING WILLIAM III. Blank Writing-book, c. 1715. 2°. ICU. Fig. 5. Style of Heawood 442. A recent acquisition of the University of Chicago Libraries is a thin folio volume neatly bound in morocco, stamped with pots and the initials IP, and containing 3 unnumbered and 83 hand-numbered leaves of blank paper. The pages measure 10¾ x 6¾" (272 x 169 mm.) and are of a good, creamy-white paper. The unnumbered leaves and leaves 1-44 are watermarked with the handsome arms of William III, with simple countermark Crown GR; and leaves 45-83 similarly with the arms of Queen Anne after the Union with Scotland (1707), with countermark GR in a wreath and oval. That is, 55% are of the one and 45% of the other. In each instance the papermaker, whether Dutch or English, 63 has made an extraordinary attempt to produce identical watermarks; and a bibliophile examining the volume might never note the difference. King William's arms consist of a crowned oval and shield quartered with the arms of England, Scotland, Ireland, England, with an inescutcheon of the Lion of Nassau, the motto "Honi Soit Qui Mal Y Pense" in the surround and "Semper Eadem" below. The whole measures 5 inches tall, or 126 x 81 mm. Both shields of the pair are carefully centered on a chain that splits crown and shield; and the shields fit precisely between attendant chains spaced 24-25 mm. (nearly an inch) apart. Differences are not readily distinguishable within the shields; but in a there is a space below the harp, and the Scotch lion is higher within its tressure flory. The lettering betrays a discongruity. In a the O of HONI is opposite the S of SEMPER; in b nearly opposite the E. In b the I of SOIT slants. In a the Q of QVI is low. In a the R of SEMPER almost touches the center chain; in b it lacks 2 mm. or so. This last is perhaps the point most easy to note in turning the pages; for some variations transpire only when the photographs are placed side by side. The countermarks (not illustrated) are even more difficult to distinguish; but one has a longish foreleg on its R, the other a slightly curved foot. So much for King William. ARMS OF QUEEN ANNE. Same blank volume. Fig 6. Style of Heawood 441. This is the feminine counterpart, on slightly thicker paper. The designs measure nearly 3¾ inches tall, or 94 x 64 mm., on chain-spaces as before. Again the crowns and shields are carefully centered, with the inner oval this time fitting within the attendant chains. The quartered arms consist of the three leopards of England impaled with the lion of Scotland (with tressure on three sides) in the first and fourth, the lilies of France in the second, and the harp of Ireland in the third, with merely the HONI SOIT motto in the band. Again differences within the shield are hard to see; but in variant a the right side of the shield is noticeably wider, and the harp is perhaps larger and closer to the lower edge. The buckle below shield a is certainly broader. Easy points of difference reside in the word MAL. Not merely does the line cut at a different place, but the A is broad in one and narrow in the other, and in b the L seems to be broken. The countermarks (not shown) are similar to that in Heawood 448 and may be distinguished by a break at the top of one oval. It is interesting to note that the main marks of William are distributed 11 and 12, and those of Anne 10 and 10. But just why the two papers were thus combined in one writing-book is not very clear. 64 The use of the countermark GR with the arms of William and Anne suggests a date not long after the accession of George I. POT C/AB. Inigo Jones, The Most Notable Antiquity of Great Britain, Vulgarly Called Stone-heng (J. Flesher, 1655). 2°. AHS, ICU. Fig. 7. The prevailing watermark in Jones's Stonehenge is a tall, baroque pot, surmounted by a circular crescent and a large fleuron (or quatrefoil), with five lobes and sets of trefoils emerging from an embroidered pot-cover, with a fleur-de-lis on its throat, a crescent C on its bowl, and another fleuron within its derby-shaped base. It, of course, is twins. But that is not all. Each twin lives and grows old. Fig. 7 a 1 shows one of these glorious pots (109 x 47) as it emerged proudly from the atelier of the formaire, perfect in every detail, except for the leftist position of its base fleuron. Its top crescent is centered, its handle is a symmetrical S, its bowl and its base are polished and unscratched. But pots lead a hard life, whether in the tavern or the papermill, and pictured next ( a 2) is the same pot after its handle has been banged, its bowl dented, and its derby base woefully crushed; and then ( a 3) this pot in a further state of degradation. Actually, I have distinguished as many as six states! Where at first its crescent is placed neatly between chains reading 4[15]4 in , in later states deformed it appears with the crescent sewn beside a chain, or cut by it, or recentered, sometimes reading out, sometimes in . In one the handle is distorted, but the base looks still good. In others the base is wrenched first one way, then the other. Strangest is the state ( a 3) in which the top crescent is once again centered, reading in, and the crescent C on the bowl has been resewn so it looks reversed! Still reasonably sound of body though infirm of limb, this pot might yet live through further accidents into age and ugliness. All the while this pot has a twin that also experiences some of life's hard knocks. Of almost identical size (111 x 47), it is distinguished by a thickish crescent above, a flattened left petal, a thinner crescent C on an eggshaped bowl, a higher bar on the A and a fleuron nicely centered within the base. Its letters consistently read out . The plate shows four states: b 1 with the handle prettily curled and tacked to the chain; b 2 in the same position but with the points of the top crescent separated and the lower line of the handle broken and sprung; b 3 with the top crescent and fleuron sewn to a chain at their right and with the handle repaired and sagging; and b 4 with the pot bent and impaled on a line and the handle sagging farther. There is even a variety, between b 1 and b 2, with the crescent points parted and the handle still intact. a Top crescent thin. Top fleuron regular. Base fleuron left .

The volume is a thin folio of 60 leaves (A-P4), with portrait and 5 folding plates (two on larger paper with shield watermarks). My copy measures 11⅛ x 7½'' (282 x 190 mm.); ICU is slightly cut down and lacks the portrait and some plates. A smaller Pot C/AB appears sporadically (AHS M3, clear), Pillars CG (?) turn up once (AHS O3), and in gatherings P and A a fine Cardinal's Hat IVL, as twins. Yet much of the life-story of the big C/AB pots is enacted before our eyes, with late states the commoner for both. In other folios I have encountered variations in sewing, a second or even a third state—but nothing like this. Yet reasons are not far to seek. The paper is clearly "fine pot." As paper improved with age, the papermaker may have stacked his reams for some months before selling; so that reams made weeks or months apart came into James Flesher's printing-house together. Flesher printed plates and early sheets on deformed pots, and later sheets mainly on the earlier states. Then finally he ran out of pots and began using hats; or else he wanted his finest paper at beginning and end. (The illustrated pots are asterisked.) The identification of the papermaker CAB is hardly possible now; but there are clues. His fondness for the crescent may have something to do with his name. The smaller C/AB pot in the Stonehenge volume has three crescents: one aloft, one in the neck, one in the initial C. Heawood illustrates an undated C/AB pot with an open, two-lined C (3601); and I have noted a pair of pots with a like C in Dudley North's Forest of Varieties (R. Cotes, 1645) (CSmH). As for the letters AB, possibly they stand for ABADIE, a family which within our century has continued to run a papermill at Theil-sur-Huisne (Orne), near the eastern confines of Old Normandy. 65 CARDINAL'S HAT IVL. Jones, Stone-heng (1655), as above. Fig. 8. This watermark well illustrates the normal use of printed folios in the study of twin watermarks. Though the mark occurs only in the final and preliminary gatherings (P and A, in fours) —thus neatly showing the preliminaries were printed last—and the letterpress of the dedications mars the photographs, the variants can be compared in detail. The Cardinal's Hat is from ecclesiastical heraldry, and thus often appears as a crest above shields in watermarks—as in Heawood 681-683, 691, 792-800. As a separate watermark the Hat was used for two decades or so: Heawood lists or illustrates a dozen varieties from 1649 on; 66 but it is not the "Cardinalls Armes" of the Oxford Pricelist, 1674. 67 Both Nicolaï and Heawood picture examples of Cardinal's Hats over handsome floriated pots; 68 and this combination of ideas, along with the appearance of hats in the Stonehenge , suggests that the Cardinal paper was for a time regarded as a fine pot paper. In the illustrations the hats can be distinguished both by their shapes and by their positions relevant to the chains. Hat a (59 x 65), is spread over several chain-spaces and measures 1[54]14 in along its brim, with its crown cut by the center chain. Hat b (57 x 61) measures 8[53]7 out along its brim and has its crown jammed between lines 24 mm. apart. The tassels differ too. The letters IVL probably stand for I. Vaulegeard, 69 of a papermaking family with a mill or mills near Sourdeval in Basse-Normandie . 70 As the letters on Hat a read in and those on Hat b read out, reversed on the indented side, the matching moulds had their marks in contrary halves. (The illustrations are from the AHS copy, A2, A3.) We now turn to a few examples of twin watermarks in Shakespearian quartos and other important books, and begin to note bibliographical uses and applications. POT P. Shakespeare, King Lear ([N. Okes], 1608). 4°. CSmH, NN. In recent years the Pide Bull quarto has received much attention from bibliographers and students of printing. Greg, Bowers, and others have revealed much of its printing history. 71 Yet little notice has been taken of the paper on which this famous quarto is printed. 72 Quite possibly (I once said to myself) the watermarks will throw further light on the way in which Lear went through the press. After an examination of two copies the answer seems to be No: this is a book with "one watermark throughout." It is in fact a model of consistency, and its watermarks verily deserve Briquet's rank of filigranes identiques . They are neat small pots, with bars and the letter P etched upon their bowls. If there are further letters I have not made them out, because of tight binding in the Lenox-New York copy and inlaying in the Kemble-Devonshire-Huntington copy. They are typical Norman pots of the time, with slender necks, handles at left, and round bowls. A chainline cuts these pots from top to toe, and provides a subtle means of distinguishing the variants, there being scarcely more than a millimeter's difference in its relative positions. These are the chain-positions, reading up: Trefoil Pot Top Neck Bowl Base a 5:3 4:2 3:2.5 9:10 11:13 b 4:4 6:6 2.5:3.5 9:10 12:12 In a the chain-spaces are 22 mm., in b nearly 23 mm. Pot a has a rather flat top and a slightly concave base; b a curved top and relatively straight base. Both bowls are 19 mm. So minute are the differences that an unpractised eye might well accept these identical twins as the same mark. 73 Where only one pair of marks appear it is obvious they offer little bibliographical help, though they do suggest a continuous printing operation. If the same pair of pots turn up in other Okes books of 1608, they might serve to identify the printing-month. 74 And it is yet possible to find mixed marks or an instrusive mark in the ten other extant copies of King Lear . POT PA. Shakespeare, The Whole Contention betweene . . . Lancaster and Yorke (W. Jaggard, 1619). 4°. CSmH. Greg 23. It is pleasant to reëxamine the watermarks that Sir Walter Greg discovered in the Shakespearian quartos of 1619, some of them falsely dated. 75 Among twenty-seven watermarks he found just one which persisted through a play; and this one did through both parts of the Contention, which have continuous signatures. The other marks were riotously distributed through eight quartos. The Contention watermark is a pot, no doubt a Norman pot, though it is topped by a heart within a circle. Its handle is on the right, with the initials PA reading toward it. Greg gives a freehand portrait of this pot, 76 pointing out that "in the 'Contention' the paper is all of one make" and has "one mark (23) throughout." 77 On the plate he notes: "The bends [in the wires] are considerable in some cases." In the light of new experience this remark now suggests the presence of filigranes similaires —two varieties differing only in minor points—and such proves to be the case. Actually, when one knows the trick, the two are quite easy to distinguish, for in Pot a the letters consistently read up , and in b as consistently down . Unlike the Pide Bull Lear, which had both pots in the same end of their moulds, the Contention probably had its pots in contrary ends. These further points also serve to distinguish the Contention pots (reading with the letters): Chains Circle Left ball Middle lobe Bowl P Base a 21 7[8]5 Bent left Slanted rt. 0[18]2 Open 2[15]3 b 20 6[8]4 On point Straight [1:19].5 Closed 4[15]1 In the Huntington copy the distribution is odd: Pot a occurs in sheets A B C D E G H I M N and b in F K L O P Q; but we must not always expect a regular alternation in twin watermarks. Variant b turns up once in the Church-Huntington copy of Pericles (1619), reading, as it should, down. Heawood has no PA pots, and the meaning of the initials is uncertain. In a similar manner most of the other Shakespearian watermarks of 1619 turn out to be pairs. Pot R/LM (Greg 2) and Pot BP (Greg 5) are particularly worthy of study. The RG Shields (Greg 15 &amp; 16) are themselves twins; but the RG/D Shield (Greg 18) may be quadruplets. These matters are somewhat complicated and deserve separate treatment. 78 SHIELD R G D &amp; THREE LIONS. William Camden, Britannia , tr. Holland (G. Bishop &amp; J. Norton, 1610). 2°. ICU. Style of Heawood 576. Lions again. Camden's great book is a crown folio (ICU 12¾ x 8½'' or 321 x 214 mm.) regularly watermarked with small crowns, but with crowned shields in its maps. Most of these are emblazoned with initialed fess and three lions. The designs (87 x 55 mm.) are neat, symmetrical, fresh— unlike the abused FM shields of Fig. 4. But the pattern is the same, the date 1610 again occupies the base with an annulet below, and the toison d'or now looks more like a sore tooth than a sheep. The third lion resembles a lion passant. The initials are G over R D; but the lower letters are so spaced, with the G above the space, that they suggest the reading RGD and the Norman papermaker Richard Guesdon. 79 Heawood nowhere lists quite so early a specimen of the lions of 1610, though he found one in John Smith's Map of Virginia, an Oxford book of 1612. 80 The Camden twins are much alike. We find them first neatly centered on chainlines, Shield a on two 20 mm. spaces, Shield b on two 21.5 mm. spaces. In a the G is above the front of the R (as in Heawood 576); in b it is spaced between the R and D. In a the line above the date is straight; in b it is curved up below the feet of the left lion. In a the numerals are normal, with the center chain slightly right of the 6; but in b the 6 is broad or sprung and almost touches the chain. And, notably, a reads in , while b reads out . In ICU Shield a turns up in the maps of Middlesex, Leicester, Nottingham, Devon, and Scotland; and b in those of Oxford, Essex, Worcester, and Ireland. So far, good. Now we examine further maps—and make twin discoveries. Both shields have a second state. Finding a in Huntington and Stafford (ICU), we note that this shield, though again centered on a chain, has different attendant chains and looks as if shifted 2 mm. to the right. The letters and date still read in . Meanwhile b turns up in Buckingham and Cheshire, no longer centered, but 2 mm. to the left with respect to the fleur-de-lis bud at top and the vent in the sheepskin below. And now this shield reads in , like its mate. As with the C/AB pots there has been a piece of resewing, though it is hard to say which state came first. Perhaps the centering was done by the mouldmaker and the resewing by a workman in the mill. Photographic comparison might reveal some slight deterioration, but to the roving eye all the lions look as fresh as a May morning. Certain other maps in the volume contain three-lion shields with the initials IG (for I. Ganne?) in the base point, but these are distorted beyond pity and horror. The reader who wishes to hunt lions will find lusty ones in Raleigh's History of the World (1614, 1621) 81 and elsewhere. CORONET (?) / GRAPES. Ovid, Metamorphosis , tr. Sandys (J. Lichfield [and W. Stansby], 1632.) 2°. CSmH (2), ICN, ICU, TxU. The common mark in this crown-size folio 82 is a paltry thing, yet it nicely illustrates an important point of difference. It presumably is intended for a small crown with fleur-de-lis over fifteen grapes in a triangle, being a degenerate form of Heawood 2343 ff. If the double stems, though, are meant for a W, it makes no sense in a French mark. Turn the thing around and it looks like grapes inverted over the letter M and a pendant. What it is hardly matters, but a small crown over SM and grapes (ICN 3M4, 2X1) and another over NG and grapes (ICU 3S1, TxU 3M4) perhaps show its archetype. The prevailing marks measure about 34 x 18 mm. Though each varies slightly in position (from resewing), the pair are distinguishable throughout the volume by the fact that one bestrides a line and the other wobbles about in a space. In mark a the tip of the grapes is on the line between 20 mm. spaces, and the lily bud (or pendant) shifts slightly within the line. Mark b commonly measures 1.5[17]1.5 across the grapes, but sometimes it measures 3[17]0 in. The W or M varies in its bends. These vagaries are instructive to study but tedious to describe. They do persuade the bibliographer to expect small variations in watermark position within a long run of one paper. The other watermarks in this Ovid deserve careful study. In some copies at least (ICN, ICU), Shields with Bends and Shields with Lions turn up in Book X. Usually the plates contain the ordinary crown/grape watermark (one CSmH, ICN, TxU), but the Chicago copy offers a procession of lions in its plates. 83 Yet this hardly answers the question raised by Bowers and Davis as to what has happened to the fifty copies known to have been printed on fine paper. 84 LABEL G HVET. Milton, Paradise Lost (S. Simmons, 1667). 4°. CSmH (2), ICN. Fletcher 1. The commonest watermark in the first edition of Paradise Lost, as Professor Fletcher has shown, is a small label or cartouche containing the name G HVET. 85 It appears at right angles to the quarto fold, with the name divided between conjugate leaves. Variant a, the one Fletcher notices and illustrates photographically, is distinguished by a T shaped like a 7 with a long top, and a label with a relatively broad right end. The G is straight and upright. The label is so placed between chains that it measures 6[10]7.5 up through the H (though it may vary slightly with resewing or shrinkage). Variant b has a T with no apparent top, and tapered label-end. The G is broader, and there are other differences in the lettering. This label measures 6.5[11]6 up through the H. The difference of the label ends is easy to see, but sometimes obscured by type. The greatest poem in English is printed on "Morlaix paper," the cheapest sort imported from France. 86 Such paper contains watermarks mainly simple and dull, often mere initials, dilapidated ones, with occasional pillars and shields (Fletcher 4 and 6); here are no ornate pots or arms from Normandy, no fine foolscap from Angoumois. The papermakers themselves were Norman, coming to the Morlaix region of Brittany, where labor was cheap, in 1629 and after. 87 The Huets came among them, and flourished. Jean Huet, Pierre Huet, other Huets were maîtres papetiers at Ploudiry, Plourin, Briec. 88 Apparently G. Huet also made paper in this region south of Morlaix. The GH of other marks (Fletcher 2) are probably his initials, and the PH (Fletcher 12) probably those of a Pierre Huet, who also worked at this time. For I have noted labels with P. HVET in books of 1657 and after; 89 and Bourde de la Rogerie mentions "Pierre Huet, papetier à Morlaix en 1678" and again in 1701, 90 perhaps a different Pierre. Just possibly the Huets made more out of Paradise Lost than did Milton. This astute family of papermakers outlasted virtually all their seventeenth-century competitors and—continue to make paper today at Pontrieux (Côtes du Nord), east of Morlaix. 91 The photographic illustrations in Harris Fletcher's facsimile edition provide excellent aid toward the study of watermarks in Milton and in Milton's time. A pair of pots are reproduced as No. A [II,134]. POT R/GD and POT G/PR. John Scheffer, The History of Lapland, tr. Cremer (Oxford: At the Theater, 1674). 2°. AHS, ICU. Style of Heawood 3693. Scheffer's Lapland is a pot folio—a true folio in twos 92 —from the last decade of pots in English printing. Except for its engraved title and its map, the book is (according to one way of looking at it) a gallery of tall and fancy pots, of which one catches glimpses beside delightful engravings of Lapps. There are three pairs of pots and one unmated pot (in the copies examined). The thing they all have in common is a handle on the deckle or outer side, though some inscriptions read in and some out. The commonest is a POT P/DB, which always reads in. Its variants may be distinguished by ( a ) a top crescent violently wrenched to the right, and ( b ) letters slanting down. This last is Heawood 3637, except that the upper D should be P: the point can be checked in the companion mark. The letters suggest the Debon family, with a mill (later) at St. Bathélemy, between Sourdeval and Mortain (Manche). 93 More attractive are the POTS R/GD, G/PR, and G/CH, all ornamented with fleurs-de-lis top and base, in a late Norman style. R/GD and G/PR prettily illustrate the fashion of making the matching moulds so that one mark is on the left side, one on the right; one reads in and one out; one handle on the left side of its pot, one on the other. I can hardly imagine a formaire planning all this and then affixing one of the wireforms to its mould with letters reading the wrong way—though that might happen later in the mill. Pot G/CH occurs once in each copy, reading in (AHS A2, ICU P2). As, judging by its good looks and supple curves, it may have been shaped by the same artisan, its companion when found may be expected to read out—towards its handle and the deckle. Reversal of pot handles occurs as early as 1640. A modest Pot G/RO (for G. Rouxel?) appears among the mixed watermarks in plays of Fletcher, Shirley, Habington (a pot folio) printed by Thomas Cotes in that year. In this case one mark reads up away from the handle, and the other also up towards the handle; so that both appear in the left halfsheet. I have noted examples in The Humorous Courtier (sheets B F H I K), The Opportunitie (B C), The Night-Walker (C H K), and The Queene of Arragon (C1.4). 94 The name-abbreviation R/GD in Scheffer may be attributed to the Guesdons, who had a mill or mills at Brouains, just west of Sourdeval in Normandy, though some of the family had migrated to Brittany by 1629. 95 Heawood 3591 may be a Guesdon pot. The meaning of G/PR is uncertain; but G/CH suggests the Chastel family, which figures in a pillar mark, H 3516. The G/CH pot is perhaps H 3685. ARMS OF FRANCE &amp; NAVARRE. Jonson, The Works (T. Hodgkin, 1692). 2°. ICN, ICU. Style of Heawood 663 or 670. This is not the best edition of Jonson: only the one with the best watermarks. It offers a pretty example of the reversal of a coat of arms. The commonest marks in it show the three fleurs-de-lis of France with the long label of D. VAVLEGARD (style of H 635-636, 654), a maker of Sourdeval or thereabouts. 96 But some sheets show the combined escutcheons of France and Navarre in a conventionalized form—the first with the three fleurs-de-lis reduced to two fishlike bearings, the other with the chains of Navarre in wheel-form. These appear in the preliminaries and in the fourth alphabet carrying the label of I. CONARD, whose mill may have been near Vaulegard's. The striking difference among these marks is that some have France on the left and Navarre on the right (ICN &amp; ICU A3) while others have the contrary arrangement (ICN A6, ICU A3). All the labels read out, but they differ in size and chain-position. The common pair measure 8[58]12 and 12[65]1; but mixed with them seems to be another pair measuring 22[62]13 and 12[65]23; which I take to be evidence that two pairs of moulds were in use on the same day at a pair of vats . The book is a demy folio. The ICN copy is 14⅛ x 9'' (359 x 230 mm.), and the ICU (the poet Thomas Campbell's copy) slightly smaller. The Oxford Pricelist of 1674 lists "Durand Demy" with "on one side. 2 Scutcheons crowned &amp; bordered vnder it A DVRAND"; and the size given for the folded quire is 15 x 9¾''. 97 Study of the watermarks in such volumes should improve our understanding of paper sizes in the seventeenth century. WHEEL or FLOWER WITHIN CIRCLES. Bartholomæus Anglicus, De Proprietatibus Rerum, tr. Trevisa (Westminster: Wynkyn de Worde, [1496]). 2°. ICN. Briquet 6608, Heawood S36. This article has found its argument mainly in seventeenth-century books printed in England on Norman paper. It turns now to a famous book printed in England on English-made paper: the Bartholomæus of 1495 or 1496. Ames, Jenkins, Briquet, Plomer have told the tale of John Tate and his mill at Hertford. 98 How Henry VII visited the mill; how Wynkyn de Worde referred to the mill in verses at the end of De Proprietatibus Rerum; how the miller became Mayor of London or at least was the son of a Mayor. Enter y e unromantick bibliographer &amp; taketh a looke at y e paper. Briquet did not look at it: he lifts his illustration from Jenkins, and calls it "Fleur à 8 pétales," which may be right. Ames and Jenkins offer engine-turned sophistications, Heawood a reduced tracing, all without benefit of chains. 99 The mark is hard to see, behind two columns of textura. Though two spokes of the Wheel of Tate show between, centered neatly on a chain, the breadth of the mark is hard to measure, and the attendant chains are ambiguous. After much peering and turning of leaves, the bibliographer decides he can distinguish two variants: one with a bump on (the lower side of) its rim; the other with circles unevenly spaced. Yet in most of the pages these points are obscured, uncertain. All the while he has missed a difference that can be seen at a glance. Regardez les pontuseaux! In one particular the two chain-patterns are remarkably different. The normal chain-space, as in the unwatermarked leaves (or halfsheets), is about 35 mm. but the spaces on which the wheel is centered are 24-27 mm. (about an inch) each. (No doubt these closer chains gave better support to the watermark.) Now, the notable difference between the moulds lies in the chain-space on the deckle side of the attendant chains. In the sheets with the bumped rim this outer space is the usual 35-36 mm. wide; but in the sheets with the spread rim it is only 28-29 mm. wide. Thus, whereas Wheel a measures 36:10[17:16]8:35 in, Wheel b measures 28:8[16:17]8:36 in. These measurements are merely approximate, of course, for the chains are not strictly parallel. But the indicated difference of 7-8 mm. is something anyone can see. As I examined the handsome Britwell-Newberry copy, 100 my wonder grew. Here is a folio in sixes and fours running through nearly three alphabets of signatures—478 leaves, as Duff notes 101 —the paper of which was manufactured on just one pair of moulds and imprinted by Wynkyn de Worde within a year of his Vitas Patrum with its alleged fifty marks. Than the Bartholomæus there are few finer English-printed books, and few thicker folios with just one paper all the way. The Newberry Library also has a fragment of the Legenda Aurea of Jacobus de Varagine, which book Wynkyn de Worde dated 8 January 1497. It is the only other book known to have been printed on paper with the wheel (or star or flower) watermark of John Tate. It is amusing to note that this fragment, consisting of nine random leaves has five without marks and four with wheels; and these four are divided two and two between the two chain variants. There seems to be no deterioration in the marks. Now looking back at the Bartholomæus I count 51 instances of variant a and 48 of b (with one remargined and uncertain) within the first alphabet and the first eleven books. This is known as normal distribution. This study has now been carried far enough to place in the hands of bibliographers who work among books of particular times and places. Some of its observations may thus grow into generalizations; while others may suggest useful analogies. The student of early printed books may take heart from the Bartholomæus: a case of filigranes identiques which proves simple to analyze. He may wish to begin with that incunabulum incunabulorum the 42-line Bible, whose three watermarks, as can be inferred from the plates of Sotheby and Dziatzko, 102 are each from a pair of moulds. The Bull's Heads differ in the spacing of the eyes, the Grapes in size and stem (one looped and one cut), and the Bullocks in the form of eye and tail. Though only three or four copies seem to have been studied, it is at once evident that pairs of moulds were in use at the inception of printing by movable type. Whether pairs of moulds were used from the beginning of European papermaking is a question for those who live with manuscripts. The oriental papermaker has always used a single unwatermarked mould. Nor does twelfth-century Spanish paper have watermarks; yet recurrent impressions of wire defects may show whether two moulds were used together at Xátiva. One of the earliest paper books I have examined, a quarto manuscript of the Four Gospels in Greek, "The Isaac Gospels," of the first half of the fourteenth century, and owned by the University of Chicago [BS 3552 1350], has thick, yellowish paper with two very crude watermarks: a pear or top-like figure and a circle with a bar extending from it. But their order in the volume does not make me certain that they derive from companion moulds. A mid-fourteenth-century manuscript at the Pierpont Morgan Library, Petri Alle-gherii super Dantis ipsius genitoris Comœdiam Commentarium [M 529] contains at least four varieties of a common early Italian mark: Two Circles surmounted by a St. Andrew's Cross. These seem to fall into two pairs, and may represent paper produced at companion vats. Two Morgan manuscripts of the fifteenth century naturally offer clearer evidence. Gerbert de Montreuil's Roman de la Violette [M 36] is an excellent example of a manuscript written on a single paper—with of course twin watermarks: an ordinary Circle and Cross, one mark slanted, one level, within chain-spaces of 40 and 42 mm. More attractive and varied marks turn up in L'Ystoyre du Saint Graal abregée ("Escripte 1479") [M 38]: a pair of Dogs with flowers and looped tails (one with the flower 9 mm. from the head, the other with a larger flower just 3 mm. from the head); a pair of Crowned Shields quartered with the arms of the Dolphin; and others. Such pairs of marks can usually be studied more readily in manuscripts than in printed books; and Briquet is an ever-present help. Thus from manuscripts on paper we may learn something more concerning its manufacture in late medieval times. For the student of sixteenth and eighteenth-century books the illustrations and analyses in these pages will suggest parallel lines of study, though the primitive pots of 1525 have little in common with the ornate and spreading eagles of 1775—except that the moulds were made in pairs. Possibly the ten points of difference will dissolve some mysteries of both centuries, or lead to techniques that will. Such study should throw further light on the original positions of wireforms, the nature and speed of their deterioration, the manner of their resewing, the use of two or more vats, and all consequent variations in a stock of paper. In the long run we may know a good deal about the life-story of watermarks. It will be asked—it should and will!—what use it is to know that watermarks like wrens go in pairs. This is no time and place for a chapter on the bibliographical significance of twin watermarks: that may come hereafter. Yet it is evident at once that even the negative implications of twin watermarks are important. Though certain investigations may come to no harm through treating filigranes identiques as the same mark, 103 a bibliographer may bring perplexity or disaster upon himself by supposing that filigranes divergentes imply different reams or papermakers. He must take into consideration even the possibility that twin watermarks may differ in the names on their labels, bearing the names of partners or of a husband and wife, or of a papermaker and his factor. 104 Certainly in the long run it simplifies matters to pair off the papermarks that belong together and that denote one consistent stock of paper. The basic equation is: Two watermarks equal one paper. It brings assurance and control into any study of mixed watermarks which seeks to answer questions of edition size, methods of press work, and time of printing. My purpose has been to rid watermarks of one besetting ambiguity. On the positive side several uses or advantages have been mentioned in these pages, and others can be found. It is worth knowing that the Bartholomæus and the Pide Bull Lear were machined (apparently) in continuous printing operations—though each has two watermarks. The historian of paper will relish the inference that John Tate's vatman and coucher applied themselves diligently at a single vat for six weeks or so to provide sufficient paper for a volume of nearly 500 leaves in an edition of perhaps 500 copies. But admittedly the homogeneity of the watermarks throws no light on the size of that edition, except to suggest it was not large. The Shakespearian quartos of 1619 have been touched on sufficiently to suggest that a realization of the binary nature of their watermarks in 1908 would have improved Greg's demonstration that plays dated 1600 and 1619 were printed in the same year. For no one would have argued that a pair of moulds might remain the same (without distortion or resewing) over a score of years, or that a mould-maker might have imitated the subtle differences of a pair of watermarks in every particular. 105 The notes on the G HVET label in Paradise Lost and the P/DB pot in The History of Lapland imply the importance of checking the lettering on the companion marks if we wish to learn the exact sources of paper. And from the investigation of geminate case-histories begin to emerge facts which should prove helpful in the analysis of books. In which halfsheet does the watermark appear? Evidently the mould-artisan sometimes affixed the wire-designs to the contrary halves of a pair of formes; and on occasion someone at the mill inverted one or resewed them both to the same end. Was paper piled consistently in quires and reams? Resolution of a run of paper into its component variants—noting the reversal of pot-handles and of the bearings on escutcheons, the differences of In and Out—reveals not infrequently a marked consistency in the arrangement of sheets. Such facts, such realizations serve also to sharpen conventional uses of watermarks. If papermarks can be used in dating (and their possibilities have been overestimated), it may be important to watch for the reappearance not of a watermark but of a pair of watermarks. In cases of cancels or standing type, if the authenticity of a leaf or sheet has been questioned because of a mark "different" from marks in contiguous sheets or other copies, the questioned mark may prove to be the unappreciated mate of one of these. In the analysis of quartos, where questions of conjunction arise, it is hardly sufficient to point out that two related leaves "show a watermark": they must show corresponding halves of the same member of a pair. One suspects that T. J. Wise and other purveyors of madeup play-quartos, while complacently matching pot tops with pot bottoms, have seldom distinguished between the marks that result from a pair of moulds. 106 Recognition of the true state of its watermarks brings the dignity of individuality to each book printed on handmade paper. Forty years ago Falconer Madan uttered his belief and warning: "There is no such thing as a duplicate ." (Librarians have scarcely heeded him.) We see new truth in his words. In terms of mixed watermarks, twin watermarks, press variants, cancels, and the gathering of sheets, every copy of every book (above the rank of mere pamphlet) may be expected to differ from all others. Even a thin play-quarto "with one watermark throughout" yields startling arithmetical combinations. The variant-patterns soar into the millions and beyond. Every original copy of the Pide Bull Lear was in all probability unique . 107</field>

Dard Hunter says: "In examining old books a great profusion of watermarks may be noted in the paper of an individual volume, some fifteenth-century works containing a dozen or more different papermarks in a single book." [ Papermaking: the History and Technique of an Ancient Craft, 2d ed. (1947), p. 261.] Thus William Blades speaks of "the astonishing variety of water-marks frequently found in one volume" of Caxton; and adds: ". . . there was a great intermixture of qualities [of paper], including the make of several mills. We have never yet seen one of Caxton's books in which the same watermark runs through the whole volume, and in many cases the variety is astonishing. Thus, in a copy of the first edition of the 'Canterbury Tales,' now in the library of Mr. Huth, there appear no less than fifteen distinct water-marks." [ The Biography and Typography of William Caxton, 2d ed. (1882), pp. 97-98.] Recently the collector Edward Heawood has cited as examples of the "large number of different marks, often seen in a single book, " Camden's Britannia (1637), Ogilby's Atlas Chinensis (1671), Fryer's New Account of East India and Persia (1698), and certain volumes printed in Italy, Holland, and Germany. [ Watermarks Mainly of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries (Hilversum, 1950), p. 33.] 3 The 42-line Bible ( c. 1456) contains three quite different watermarks: Bull's Head, Grapes, and Bullock, each with two variants. See Samuel Leigh Sotheby, The Typography of the Fifteenth Century, Being Specimens together with Their Watermarks (1845), pl. Z, no. 92; and Karl Dziatzko, Gutenbergs Früheste Druckerpraxis, Sammlung Bibliothekswissenschaftlichen Arbeiten , Heft IV (1890), pp. 41-50 and pl. III. 4 Samuel Leigh Sotheby, Principia Typographica to Which Is Added an Attempt to Elucidate the Character of the Paper Marks of the Period (1858), III, 102. Sotheby treats Caxton's watermarks at pp. 83-88 and pls. Qa-Qc. 5 On a suggestion of A. W. Pollard, Greg offered this hypothesis: "The middleman bought large stocks of paper from the manufacturer and sold comparatively small parcels of various sizes to printers. The inevitable result was that he was left with a number of oddments, remainders of various sizes, on his hands. These he simply stacked together and sold off cheap." [W. W. Greg, "On Certain False Dates in Shakespearian Quartos," Library, 2d ser., IX (1908), 395-396.] McKerrow concluded: ". . . it seems quite clear that many printers bought their paper in job-lots, and it is common to find a number of different watermarks in a book about the printing of which there appears to have been nothing abnormal." [Ronald B. McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography (1927), p. 101 n.] And in examining paper prices Marjorie Plant remarked: "It seems . . . as if the dealer was willing to sell off odd quires cheaply, and it may be for this reason that so many sixteenth-century books contain a number of different watermarks." [ The English Book Trade (1939), p. 204.] But there was no reason to suppose that the varying prices applied to the same paper. 6 Greg, pp. 386-397. 7 Ibid. , tables before p. 381. 8 "New Uses of Watermarks as Bibliographical Evidence," [ Studies in Bibliography ], I (1948), esp. 152-163. 9 That a considerable part of the paper is Norman was shown by Edward Heawood in "Papers Used in England after 1600," Library, 4th ser., XI (1930-31), 263-299, 466-498, and "Further Notes on Paper Used in England after 1600," ibid. , 5th ser., II (1947-48), 119-149. That the greater part of it was Norman and Norman-Breton I shall attempt to show in some "Notes on Norman Papermakers" now in preparation. 10 H. Bourde de la Rogerie cites evidence from official surveys that in the eighteenth century practically all mills in Brittany had just one vat each. See Les papeteries de la région de Morlaix, Contribution à l'histoire de la papeterie en France, VIII (Grenoble, 1941), esp. 57-61. 11 Published archives of the eighteenth century mention Julien Sagory "marchand-papetier à Morlaix," Yves Plassard "marchand papetier" apparently of the same place, and "Biard, marchand de papier et d'images à Brest." See Inventaire-sommaire des archives dèpartementales . . . finistere, B 4549, 4551, 4581. Nothing is known of such merchants in Normandy. In the seventeenth century there must have been English factors at Caen, Morlaix, and elsewhere. Nicolaï names some paper dealers and Dutch factors of the Angoumois. See Alexandre Nicolaï, Moulins à papier du sudouest de la France (Bordeaux, 1935), I, 49-50, 164, 170, 183. 12 Bourde de la Rogerie gives an account of many mills near Pleyber-Christ and Plourin, along the Jarlot and Queffleut just south of Morlaix [pp. 23 ff]. As late as the nineteenth century a writer in describing the valley of the Haute-Sée near Brouains and Sourdeval in Normandy speaks of "l'industrie qui a jeté mille usines à papier sur ses bords." [ La Normandie illustrée (Nantes, 1852), II, pt. 6, 39.] Nicolaï lists clusters of mills along the Charreau, Boëme, and other streams below Angoulême [I, 154], and points out that the clusters had been larger before the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, 1685. 13 As in Raleigh's History of the World (1677) and Blome's Cosmography and Geography (1680-93). See Heawood, "Papers Used in England after 1600," p. 267; Watermarks, nos. 662, 663, 665a, 672, 678; and further examples can be cited. 14 The Oxford Pricelist of 1674 (among other evidence) shows that paper was imported from these three ports, of Normandy, Brittany, and the Angoumois respectively. See R. W. Chapman, "An Inventory of Paper, 1674," Library, 4th ser., VII (1926-27), 405-408. 15 See my "New Uses of Watermarks," esp. the tables, pp. 167, 172. 16 Hunter, pp. 435-440. This is part of a very informative chapter on "Present-day Papermaking by Hand in Europe." 17 The deckle is the frame that fits the two moulds of a pair and limits the edges of the sheet. See Hunter, figs. 297, 301. By metonymy the word also means the rough edges of the sheet itself. For definitions of terms see E. J. Labarre, Dictionary and Encyclop&amp;c.nt;dia of Paper and Paper-making , 2d ed. (Amsterdam, 1951). 18 The stay is the board to the left of the vatman on which he places the moulds for the coucher. Hunter, figs. 294, 305. 19 The post is the pile of felts and wet sheets. Ibid. , fig. 303. 20 The bridge is the platform at the back of the vat along which the coucher returns the moulds to the vatman. Ibid. , figs. 294, 298, 299, 305. 21 La Lande wrote: "Les operations . . . sont si promptes, qu'il se forme sept à huit feuilles par minute dans les grandeurs moyennes de papier, telle que la Couronne; en sorte qu'un Ouvrier peut faire huit rames dans la journée . . ." [Joseph Jérome Le Français de La Lande, Art de faire le papier , Institut de France, Académie des Sciences, Descriptions des arts et métiers . IV (Paris, 1761), 55.] Cf. Le Clert: "On estimait qu'un ouvrier, dans sa journée, pouvait faire de 7 à 8 rames de papier de 500 feuilles chacune, soit de 3500 à 4000 feuilles." [Louis Le Clert, Le Papier (Paris, 1926), I, 13.] Yet vatmen sometimes made even more. Schulte reckons that "Etwa 2500-3000 mal wird der Vorgang mit jeder Form täglich wiederholt . . ."

Thus 7[73]4 measures a design spread over nearly four chain-spaces, and o[79]o one that just fits within four. 42 Briquet, I, xix. 43 Sotheby, Principia Typographica , III, 15. 44 See e.g. Heawood 297-298, 633, 655 &amp; 662, 943-944, 1494-95, 1518-19, 1541 &amp; 1705, 1645, 1648-48a, 1868 &amp; 1869a, 1878-79, 1972-73, 2079-79a, 2081-82, 2086-86a, 2234-35, 2236-36a, 2284-85, 2289-90, 2301, 2649, 3297 (bis), 3387, 3389, 3681-82.

In variant a the back of the C and the front of the P touch or nearly touch the bounding lines; whereas in variant b the letters are fallen together so that they measure but 48 mm. across. In b the C is thinner and the P has a thicker stem. This mark Briquet would call a filigrane divergente . 50 Pp. 134, 164-166, 169. The book is printed on handmade paper made by Dard Hunter and in type cut and cast by Dard Hunter Jr. The prospectus states: "The many specimens of old line watermarks appearing as illustrations in each book have been made in the actual paper with the exact number of laid- and chain-lines, duplicating faithfully the original American watermarks in private and public collections." 51 For the German manuscript leaves I thank my student-friend Rudolph Jirgal of Chicago; for the endpapers Mr. D. F. Bogardus of the Huntington Library, who kindly gave me duplicates from his small collection of watermarked paper; for the watermarks of royal arms Mrs. Merle Boub of the University of Chicago Libraries, who called my attention to the blank volume on its arrival from England. The photographs are the work of Mr. Cabot T. Stein of the University of Chicago Department of Photographic Reproduction; and the halftones that of the Pontiac Engraving and Electrotype Co. of Chicago. There is an art in photographing and photoengraving fools and pots. 52 Robert H.

See Labarre, Dictionary , "Chain lines." 54 Fig. 4b shows a shield watermark with the date reversed. Among reversed shields note Heawood 583, 585, 587, 591, 596, &amp;c. 55 Tranchefiles are extra wires at the ends of the moulds between the last rib and the frame. The term is from La Lande. For a bibliographical use of tranchefiles see Povey and Foster, "Turned Chain-lines," where they help to identify sheets with longitudinal chainlines made on double moulds. 56 Perhaps the initials PLG in Heawood 2929 are his; and several triplets in LG may denote the Legrand family. 57 Heawood, "Papers Used in England after 1600," pp. 266, 267, 279; "Further Notes," p. 125; Watermarks , no. 440[?].

Mr. Bogardus kindly parted with the duplicates. 63 Perhaps this paper was the manufacture of the White Paper Company, formed in England in 1686 by Nicholas Dupin with French and English associates for the making of "all sorts of writeing and printing paper, and to imprint our arms upon such paper." The Company benefited from the art of Huguenot workmen exiled to England by the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685; and its charter ran to 1704 or after. See Rhys Jenkins, "Paper-making in England, 1682-1714," Library Association Journal , III (1901), 240-246. 64 It may have been prepared for someone at Court.

["On Certain False Dates," p. 123 n.] 73 Incidence of the variants in the Huntington and New York copies: a : CSmH: C2.3 D2.3 F1.4 H3.2; NN: C4.1 F1.4 G1.4 K1.4. b : CSmH: B4.1 E2.3, G2.3, I1.4, K4.1, L4.1, A-.2 (tp); NN: B2.3 D1.4 E2.3 H4.1 I1.4 L2.3. In each instance the leaf with the pot top is given first. The handle is consistently out (on the deckle side). 74 As Lear was entered on 26 November 1607, presumably it was printed within the first half of 1608. The only other play printed by Nicholas Okes in 1607-8 is Markham and Machin's Dumbe Knight (1608), which was not entered until 6 October 1608 and has no pots in common with Lear (CSmH copies). 75 "On Certain False Dates," pp. 120-127, 131, 386-396, with plate. 76 Ibid. , plate, no. 23. 77 Ibid. , pp. 127, 393. 78 The R/LM pots are those whose slight variations were discussed by Greg and Huth.

Greg, ibid. , pp. 889-890; "On Certain False Dates," pp. 386-390; Huth, "The Shakespeare Quartos," Athenœum , No. 4239 (1909), 101; Greg, ibid. , No. 4240 (1909), 132.] Actually, the most apparent distinction between the R/LM twins is not a minute difference in the size of their bases but a difference of four millimeters (19, 23) in the width of their chain-spaces . This is an excellent illustration of the third point of difference. The pot with wide chains also has a plainly bent center lobe. Besides the six 1619 quartos named by Greg ["On Certain False Dates," Table I], this Pot R/LM occurs in Henry V (ICN). 79 The Guesdons had a mill at Brouains, near Sourdeval (Manche). See Bourde de la Rogerie, p. 21; cited (with errors) by Edward Heawood, "Paper Used in England after 1600," Library, 5th ser., III (1948-49), 142. The Richard Guesdon mentioned by Bourde de la Rogerie went to Morlaix around 1630; but a Julien Guesdon still had a mill at Brouains in 1765. [ Inventaire-sommaire des archives départementales . . . calvados, C 2903.] But another possibility is the Rondel family; cf. Heawood 1973. 80 Printed by J. Barnes. The Huntington copy has a different three-lion shield in its map, with P [tower] D in place of the date. 81 Some of these are dated 1610 and have interesting variants. See my "Shakespearian Dated Watermarks," later in this volume. 82 The largest page measurements recorded by Bowers and Davis are 341 and 222 mm.—or 13.4 and 8.7"—which agrees with the Oxford Pricelist mean of 13¾ x 9¼" for a folded quire of crown paper. See Fredson Bowers and Richard Beale Davis, George Sandys: A Bibliographical Catalogue of Printed Editions in England to 1700 (1950), pp. 31-32; and Chapman, pp. 405-407. 83 ICU has three lions on large shields in thick paper for the plates to Books 3, 4, 15; three lions on smaller shields in thin paper for the plates to Books 5, 6, 7, 14; with the remaining plates unwatermarked (that for Book 9 wanting). It also has three-lion shields in the text at 2T1, 2V3, 2V4, 2X2, 3V2. Cf. certain Virginia, Clark, and Huntington copies described in Richard Beale Davis, "George Sandys v. William Stansby: The 1632 Edition of Ovid's Metamorphosis," Library , 5th ser., III (1948-49), 208-209. 84 Bowers and Davis, p. 31. One or more of the fine-paper copies listed by Stansby [Davis, pp. 198-199] may yet come to light. They will not necessarily be taller copies, for the crowned shield with fess and three lions clearly was a way of marking fine crown paper. Cf. the discussion of the plates in Camden's Britannia (1910), above. 85 Harris F. Fletcher, ed., John Milton's Complete Poetical Works Reproduced in Photographic Facsimile , II (1945), 120. 86 Where the mills of Normandy used pots, fools, and crowns rather systematically to mark pot, foolscap, and crown paper, the mills of Brittany appear to have used a variety of marks in these sizes. This my experience is borne out by the Oxford Pricelist of 1674 [Chapman, pp. 407-408], which gives marks and sizes and prices for both Caen and Morlaix papers of these sorts. The Morlaix prices are regularly lower, though for reams of 24-sheet quires. 87 Bourde de la Rogerie, pp. 21, 25. 88 Ibid. , pp. 20, 28, et passim for other Huets. 89 Francis Bacon, Resuscitatio (S.

Gordon Duff, Fifteenth Century English Books (1917), no. 40, p. 11. 102 Sotheby, Typography of the Fifteenth Century, III, pl. Z, no. 92; Dziatzko, Guten-bergs Früheste Druckerpraxis , pl. III. Briquet distinguishes the two grape watermarks as 13,040 and 13,009. 103 See n. 94. 104 Le Clert notes [I, 16]: "Les formes étaient fabriquées non seulement pour les fabricants de papier, mais aussi pour des marchands qui y faisaient apposer leurs marques ou filigranes et les remettaient ensuite aux papetiers chargés d'exécuter leur commandes." James Wardrap notes an instance of "sheets watermarked alternately W BALSTON and J WHATMAN," in 1810. See "Mr. Whatman, Papermaker," Signature, No. 9 (July 1938), 18 n. 105 Sir Walter Greg examined an early nineteenth-century mould and neatly disposed of Huth's contention that the watermarks themselves may have been moulded, rather than formed separately of wires. See W. W. Greg, "The Shakespeare Quartos," Athenœum, No. 4239 (1909), 100-101. As we have seen, various writers testify to the impossibility of making two wireforms exactly alike. 106 For Wise's industry in making books "perfect" see Letters of Thomas J. Wise to John Henry Wrenn , ed. Fannie E. Ratchford (1944), pp. 77, 301, 396, 454, 458. 107 Collation: A 2 B-K 4 . Sir Walter Greg found in twelve copies seven formes variant, each in a different sheet. [ the Variants in the First Quarto of 'King Lear' , ch. II.] Not counting second corrections in inner C or an altered catchword in inner K, and assuming equal numbers of uncorrected and corrected sheets (the totals being 42 and 46 among extant copies), that means 2 7 or 128 possible combinations within an edition of perhaps 1000 copies. But consider the watermarks. One paper with twin watermarks in 9 1/2 sheets means 2 10 or 1024 possible combinations, enough to allow a different watermark sequence for each copy. And now it may be pointed out that a pot can have its top or base in any one of the four leaves of a quarto gathering—and the pots so vary in position in examined copies of Lear . And even in an unwatermarked halfsheet the chain-pattern varies. Thus, in this simplest of cases, with only a third of the formes known to be variant and with only one pair of "identical" watermarks so far found, the possible combinations work out roughly as 2 7 x 2 10 x 4 10 = 2 37 = 137,438,954,000. What chance is there for a duplicate Pide Bull among so many? What chance? If such is the case with single-paper books, then what of books printed on a variety of papers, books with mixed watermarks! Clearly the possible combinations are astronomical, even if we assume only one or two pairs of marks within each edition-sheet. Let the reader perpend (if it does not terrify him) the case of the St. Jerome Vitas Patrum of Wynkyn de Worde with its fifty watermarks—whether this number includes pairs or not. He will need a ream of white paper for his problem, and a jar of paste.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Some Bibliographical Irregularities in the Shakespeare Fourth Folio by Giles E. Dawson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Collation and Pagination THE FOURTH FOLIO OF SHAKESPEARE (1685) was printed in three sections by three different printers, the first of whom Professor Bowers has recently shown to have been Robert Roberts. 1 The collation of F4 is i 2 i A 4 A-Y 6 Z 4 , 2B-2Z 6 *3A-*; 3D 6 *3E 8 , 3A-4B 6 4C 2 . Roberts' section, which, as Bowers demonstrates, includes the preliminary sheets, contains the Comedies and ends with Z4; the second section contains the Histories and Troilus, Coriolanus, Titus, and Romeo and ends with *3E8; the third contains the rest of the Tragedies and the apocryphal plays. In the second section errors in signatures are uncommonly numerous, and some of these are not without interest. The most serious of the errors consist of the misprinting of sigs. 2B1 through 2C3 as B, B2, B3; C, C2, C3. 2D3 is printed D3. 2E3 is not printed. 2O1 is printed Pp. *3E1 and *3E2 are printed without the asterisks; but *Eee3 and *Eee4 are correctly so printed. Being important in the gathering and folding of sheets, signatures are in most books printed much more carefully than pagination; we do not often meet with such gross carelessness as these sheets exhibit. Nor was it here allowed to pass unnoticed. On the contrary, once these errors were discovered the printer took drastic steps to correct at least those most likely to make trouble. The discovery appears to have occurred while 2O1 was in the press and near the end of its run, for in only about fifteen per cent of the thirty-seven copies which I have examined at the Folger has a press correction been made. In all the rest of the thirty-seven the misprinted signature has been corrected with a pen. No other press corrections were, so far as I have found, made, but in every copy 2B1 and 2C1 have been amended by pen, likewise 2C3 (but not 2B3 or 2D3). In many copies 2C2 has been amended by pen, and in most 2E3, omitted in the printing, has been written in. A typical specimen copy may be seen in the Methuen facsimile, where all the corrections noted above except 2C2 will be found. The hand—most readily recognizable in the added 2E3—is the same in all copies which I have seen. The press correction of one, and only one, of these errors—and that the last significant one made—together with the pen correction of the misprinted copies of this sheet, strongly suggests that the earlier errors were not discovered until this point was reached and that all the other pen corrections were ordered forthwith and effected in this unknown printer's shop. Sections 1 and 3 contain no significant errors in signing. The pagination of the volume is A1-H6, 1-96; I1-O1, 99-160; O2-X5, 163-254; X6-Z3, 253('243')-272; 2B1-*3E8, 1-328, 3A1-4C2, 1-302. In addition to the errors indicated in this formula which affect the total count of Section 1, the following simple errors occur in all copies (ten in number) in which I have examined the pagination: 109 is printed for 107, 111 for 109, 186 for 190, 187 for 191, 221 for 219, 234 for 246, 243 for 253 bis. In nine of the ten copies 33 is misprinted 23, and in three 164 is misprinted 160, and 169-171. This carelessness in the printing of page numbers is not uncommon either in kind or, I believe, in degree. Far more unusual is the excellent pagination in Section 2, where I have found no errors of any kind. Section 3 falls but little short of this ideal, having, so far as I have found, only one simple misprint: 176 for 167. All the errors in Section 1 noted above (as well as that in Section 3) may be seen in the Methuen facsimile, with the exception of pp. 164 and 169.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. Reprinted Sheets Sixteen and a half sheets of the middle section occur in two printings. Most copies, including that reproduced in the Methuen facsimile, contain the original printing, the reprinted sheets having been found in only six copies—four in the Folger Library, two in the New York Public Library. The table below shows the distribution of the reprinted sheets in the six copies. Discovery of the reprinted sheets (which for the sake of brevity I will hereafter call F5, since they constitute a fifth folio printing) would presumably have been deferred even longer were it not for an obvious clue. For some obscure reason the side rules and the foot rules were in the printing of the F5 sheets omitted. 4 Each normal page is boxed with rules, side, head, and foot, with an additional horizontal rule beneath the headline and a vertical rule between the two columns of text. The reprinted leaves uniformly lack the side rules and the horizontal foot rule, 5 though all others are as in the original F4 printing. The absence of the rules is the conspicuous difference between the two states of the sheets—the flag which gives notice of their presence. A further comparison shows that one state is a reprint of the other. Except for the rules they do not differ notably in general appearance, but upon close inspection innumerable small differences become apparent throughout. Collation reveals just such variants as we might except. 6 There can be no doubt as to which kind of sheets are the reprinted ones—the rules tell us that much. Collation of the original F4 sheets with the corresponding sheets of F3 (1663-4) and F5 give the expected results: F4 was printed from F3, F5 from F4. In F5 obvious F4 misprints are in the main corrected. Its text shows a marked tendency towards modernization of spelling and towards a regular use of the apostrophe in possessives. New misprints are about as numerous as corrections. None of the alterations point to the hand of anyone but the compositor. The explanation for the reprinting is not far to seek. The distribution of F5 sheets in the six copies affected—with fifteen in Folger 28 and only one in NYPL Lenox—suggests that the printer of this middle section of F4 either carelessly or fraudulently under-printed these sheets. When the gathering of all sheets into volumes was nearly finished and the stacks were all getting low, a few stacks were exhausted or it was seen that they soon would be, leaving a stock of something more than two hundred different good sheets—how many of each I will explore presently. At what time in relation to the original printing the discovery of the shortages and the subsequent reprinting are likely to have taken place can be determined only conjecturally. Several avenues of approach to this problem must be investigated. First, what significance can be attached to the omission of side and foot rules? The complete boxing in of type pages with rules was first commonly practised toward the end of the sixteenth century and became increasingly popular in the early decades of the seventeenth, until, by 1630, it was almost universal—though never quite so—in books printed in England. Soon after 1640 we begin to find unruled pages with increasing frequency. Charles Edmonds' Commentaries of Julius Cœsar , 1655, though a folio with double columns is entirely without rules. Burton's Anatomy , 1676, a folio printed in double columns, is ruled exactly as are the pages of F5—horizontal above and beneath the headlines, vertical between columns. The Works of the Learned Sir Thomas Brown, Kt., 1686, a folio in single columns, is printed with double head-rules only, except in the index, the pages of which are ruled exactly as those of F5 are. In fact I have found folios so ruled in every decade from 1600 to 1720. Clearly then the rules of the F5 pages cannot be regarded as direct evidence as to the date of printing. It does seem safe to say, however, that they do indicate either a date substantially later than the original printing in 1685 or a different printing house. For if Herringman had discovered the short count of seventeen or more sheets soon after their delivery to him he would presumably have demanded that the printer of the central section make the deficiency good, and it is scarcely conceivable that the same printer would then have produced reprints so strikingly different from the originals in appearance as these are. We may well ask why any printer at any probable time would have done so, and this is a question to which I can furnish no very satisfactory answer. That the printer did not have enough rules is out of the question. It must have been simply a mistake of some sort. Perhaps the workman actually responsible for the make-up of the formes, not fully aware of the nature of the job in hand, only followed the custom of the house for folio printing in two columns prevailing at that period. Had the printing been done in the shop that had produced the original F4 sheets, and with no considerable lapse of time, such an error would not be likely. Evidence derived from watermarks leads to much the same conclusion. Virtually all of the normal sheets of the volume—not only in the middle section but in all three—show some variety of a group of watermarks bearing the name DVAVLEGARD beneath a large shield surrounded by a sort of ruffled or fluted collar. I have found here only one completely different and unrelated mark—a small, plain, crowned shield bearing a simple fleur-de-lis and the initials RO, beneath which is the name N. Porte or O. N. Porte. 7 No watermark which I have seen in F4 occurs in any F5 sheet. There, instead, are five different marks—three forming a related family, the other two another family. 8 Since I have not succeeded in finding any of these elsewhere they yield no direct evidence as to the date at which the F5 sheets were printed. But they again argue either for a date later than 1685 or for another printer. Finally there is the evidence of spelling and the regular use of the apostrophe in possessives. The spelling shows a good deal of what might be called modernization: will for wil, Doll. for Dol., Country for Countrey, warlike for warlick, Lion for Lyon, and the like. The last decades of the seventeenth century and the early years of the eighteenth were a period of marked standardization of spelling—probably not to be matched in any like period before or since. This tendency did not begin in 1685; indeed it had no beginning, but was in my opinion accelerating more or less steadily in the second half of the century. Such changes as I have listed, with the possible exception of the use of apostrophes, would be expected, or at least would not be surprising, at any date after 1650. In fact the same sorts of modernization abound in F4, the actual count of spelling changes (from the F3 text) per page being there higher than in F5. As we should expect, the F4 compositor, while conforming in general to the standardizing trend of the day was not consistent and left many relics of the F3 spelling. The F5 compositor or compositors carried on in the same direction. Much the same may be said too of the increased use of the apostrophe in possessives: the F4 compositor introduced a few of these; the F5 compositor was more consistent and carried this modernization further. It can hardly be said then that we have any clear direct evidence of a substantially later date for F5 than for F4. The most that we can say is that the absence of side and foot rules, the completely different watermarks, and a strong tendency towards modernization of spelling, taken all together, make it appear highly probable that F5 was printed either in a different shop or at a date a good deal later than the printing of F4. But the employment of another printer would in itself be strong evidence of the passage of time between the two printings. The two come to much the same thing. And if I reconstruct the probable history of the sheets of the volume correctly it seems unlikely on the face of it that the need for reprinting would have been observed at once. The volume was issued with a variety of imprints—three in all: (1) LONDON , | Printed for H. Herringman, E. Brewfter , and R. Bentley , at the Anchor in the | New Exchange, the Crane in St. Pauls Church-Yard, and in | Russel -Street Covent-Garden . 1685. (2) LONDON , | Printed for H. Herringman, E. Brewfter, R. Chiswell , and R. Bentley, at the Anchor | in the New Exchange ; and at the Crane , and Rose and Crown in St. Pauls | Church-Yard, and in Russell -Street Covent-Garden . 1685. (3) LONDON , | Printed for H. Herringman , and are to be fold by Joseph Knight | and Francis Saunders , at the Anchor in the Lower Walk | of the New Exchange . 1685. Henry Herringman owned in 1685 at least a half interest in the copyrights of most of Shakespeare's plays, and the fact that his name, and only his, appears in all the imprints, always in the first position, makes it appear that he was the principal if not the sole capitalist in the publication. 9 The other booksellers named were probably small investors, each receiving a stipulated number of copies. It is significant that all the copies containing F5 sheets possess, or probably did possess, title-pages with the first and commonest of the three imprints. 10 This fact does not in itself, of course, prove that the shortages were not soon discovered, for it is natural to assume that the stipulated numbers of sheets to go to the booksellers named in the imprints would be counted out for them at once upon publication. Herringman, primarily a wholesale dealer, would retain the greater part of the stock, and except for a number of sheets gathered into volumes for immediate sale I suspect that the rest would have gone into his warehouse in bundles of ungathered sheets. Nothing is known about the date at which the edition was exhausted, but we may safely assume that a work as big and as dear as this remained in print for fifteen or twenty years; had it been otherwise, presumably, another edition would have been called for before 1709, the year in which Tonson brought out Rowe's edition. By 1700, fifteen years after publication, the smaller investors would long since have disposed of their stocks, the principal publisher would have got his money back, and sales, each one of which would be cash in his pocket, would have slowed to a trickle. Herringman's successor, 11 whoever he was, would have in his warehouse 229 bundles or stacks of ungathered sheets, from which, as need arose, a dozen or so copies would be made up. It seems to me a reasonable if untested hypothesis that at some such time the shortage of some sheets was discovered. Sheet 2O3:4 may well have been the first exhausted. A count then revealed that others were near exhaustion, and a calculation of costs and of the probability of future sales showed that it would be profitable to go to the expense of reprinting the seventeen or more sheets required to make the remaining stock good. The only questions yet to be considered are how many copies of the good sheets of F4 remained and how many different sheets were underprinted. No precise answers can of course be given, but some calculations can be made on the basis of the table above. While not attempting a census of extant copies, I have myself examined fifty-seven and have received reliable reports on nine others. 12 Six of these, or approximately ten per cent, contain one or more F5 sheets (if we count Folger 13, which, though its single leaf is not indigenous, represents a copy with a whole sheet). Sixty-six is a large enough number to be considered representative, and I therefore assume that something like ten per cent of all copies now or at any time existing would contain one or more of the F5 sheets. This means that the most deficient of the sheets of the middle section of F4—probably 2O3:4—was approximately ten per cent short. If this is substantially correct, then, supposing that the publisher's contract with each of the three printers called for two thousand copies, printer number two delivered only 1800 copies of 2O3:4. Even if the impression was only half this size there remained when 2O3:4 was exhausted one hundred copies of each of the good sheets. There could have been no question then of the profitableness of reprinting the short sheets, assuming that sales were still at an even moderately good level. At least seventeen different sheets required reprinting. Were there probably more? The table gives us every reason for believing that there were and that others still exist and will be found. 13 Had Folger 28 perished or gone to another collection not seen by me I should have missed three of the seventeen sheets. Folger 33 contains another apparently unique example. The mathematical probability that others would be found if sixty-five further copies were examined is so high as to amount almost to certainty. Since two out of the six copies shown in the table contain four apparently unique examples I am inclined to believe that the number of sheets reprinted in 1700 (or whenever it was) must have been somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty-five.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. Sig. Li, pp. 123-4, Section I Though many persons who have used the Fourth Folio must have observed that pp. 123-124 in Love's Labour's Lost are set in 8-point type instead of the 12-point used elsewhere throughout the volume, no one has been sufficiently curious about it to work out the explanation, or at any rate, thought it worthwhile to print it. 14 No variant is involved here, for all copies, including the Methuen facsimile, are in this respect alike. Throughout F4 normal columns contain 74 lines of type. The four columns of pp. 123-124 contain 91, 90, 91 and 90 lines. All other pages of the L gathering, including those of L6, the leaf conjugate with L1, are printed in the usual type and with the usual number of lines. The explanation is not difficult. Printing began with the inner sheet, L3:4, probably with its inner forme. L2:5 was printed and perfected next. Then the working off of either the inner or the outer forme of L1:6 was begun. At this point the proofreader discovered that a block of text had been omitted and that some resetting would be required. If possible the resetting must be confined to L1, since L2 r :5 v was already printed off or so far along that any resetting here would involve the discarding of much valuable paper as well as presswork. And, as we can see, it proved to be possible. Had the printing of L2 r :5 v not been finished or well along, the resetting could have been, and would have been, spread out so as to avoid such unsightly pages as 123-124 are. For their unsightliness is not caused only by the smaller type. Additional compression has been accomplished by the elimination of all of the usual white spaces at stage directions, by the printing of two very short speeches in one line (in seventeen places), and (in one place) by forcing three lines of verse into two type lines. A further small gain resulted from the fact that much of the first column of p. 123 is prose, which allows more words to the line in the smaller type. Thus no true measure of the total compression obtained is to be arrived at by the mere counting of lines and the discovery that the four reset columns contain 362 lines instead of the usual 296. But in another way we can calculate the amount of compression almost precisely. The text which now fills pp. 123-124 ( L.L.L. V.i.13 to ii.254, in the Globe edition) occupies 425 lines in F3, counting all white spaces at stage directions. If we assume that this was originally set up in the same way in F4—that is with the same spacing—296 lines would have been accommodated, leaving a balance of 129 lines. Since F3 is set 66 lines to the column, 129 lines is almost exactly one page. We can safely assume then that what the proofreader found missing from the F4 had been one page of the F3 text. This means that the omission was due to the compositor, for only he could have been concerned with F3 pages. Nothing about the F3 text of the passage involved suggests any reason for the omission or any clue as to which page was omitted. We have no way of knowing certainly that the whole first forme, presumably the inner, of L1:6 was not actually wrought off before the detection of the omission. But it appears probable that had this been the case L1 would have been cancelled so that L6 could be salvaged, reducing the loss of paper by fifty per cent. That no such cancellation was made suggests that the omission was discovered in the first forme in the press.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 M. W. Black and M. A. Shaaber call attention to the three separately-printed sections in Shakespeare's Seventeenth-Century Editors, 1632-1685 (1937). Bowers' identification is in "Robert Roberts: A Printer of Shakespeare's Fourth Folio," Shakespeare Quarterly , II (1951), 240-246. 4 The strikingly different appearance of these partially unruled pages is noticed in Contributions to a Catalogue of the Lenox Library, No. V. Works of Shakespeare, Etc. (New York, 1880), p. 41, where the lack of side rules in 2O3:4 is commented on. A previous owner of Folger 7 also observed at least some of the pages without side rules and pencilled inside the front cover a note attempting to explain the conditions: 'Some lls appear to be in proof state before lined borders were printed in.' It was this note which first drew my attention to the reprinted leaves. 5 At least I have found no exception. It is conceivable that some sheets were reprinted with all rules, but if they were they have escaped me, for they could be discovered only by chance or by an exhaustive (and exhausting) collation, which I have not attempted; I have only borne the possibility in mind and been on the lookout for such sheets. 6 I have not collated the whole of the 70 pages, but instead made a spot check, collating some fifteen or twenty scattered columns. It then began to appear doubtful that further hours of collating would reveal more significant facts than I had already found. 7 I cannot claim to have looked at every sheet or nearly every one, but I have seen a great many of them. Edward Heawood, Watermarks (Hilversum, 1950), reproduces (nos. 654, 671) two very similar but not identical DVAVLEGARD marks. Others may be seen in the second folio Beaumont and Fletcher, Fifty Comedies and Tragedies, 1679. The bearings on the shields are various and always complex and unheraldic in appearance. In all I have distinguished four markedly different DVAVLEGARD marks in F4. 8 Ia a large crowned shield bearing a post horn, with initials WR; Ib a large crowned shield bearing a fleur-de-lis, with initials WR over IG; Ic the same but without IG; IIa grapes with a crooked stem at the top and initials MLP (or M P?); IIb grapes with small fleur-de-lis at top and initials IP. In every sheet except two of the F5 sheets the same mark appears throughout all copies. Nor is that all, for they tend to occur in groups. All the sheets (as shown in the table) from 2I3:4 through 2O3:4 contain IIb; from 2T3:4 through 2Y1:6 contain Ia; from 2Z2:5 through 3B2:5 contain IIa. 9 G. E. Dawson "The Copyright of Shakespeare's Dramatic Works," Studies in Honor of A.H.R.Fairchild (University of Missouri Studies, 1946), pp. 11-35. 10 I say 'probably did possess' because one, the NYPL Lenox copy, now has the Knight-Saunders imprint; but Mr. P. N. Rice, chief of the reference department (to whom and to whose assistants I am much indebted for skilful, prompt, and patient help in examining the NYPL copies and answering my troublesome questions) writes that this copy, which has been rebound by Bedford, is sophisticated and that the title and frontispiece 'might well have been inserted in the place of others.' Four of the other five copies have the first title. Of the Folger copies no. 7 appears to be in the original binding and perfect throughout; 28 (rebound) has had at least one interior leaf added (see note 2 above), but all the preliminaries appear to be indigenous; 33 is rebound, but handwriting on the title and on many other leaves proves its title to be the original; for 13, which has no title, see note 3 above. Of the twenty-nine Folger copies of F4 having titles, twenty-three have the first imprint, two the second, and four the third. 11 Herringman did not die until 1704, but he had turned his retail trade over to Knight and Saunders as early as 1684, as C. W. Miller has shown in "Henry Herringman, Restoration Bookseller-Publisher," Papers of the Bibl. Soc. of Amer., XLII (1948), 292-306. If any stock of the Fourth Folio remained as late as 1700 it is unknown who may have held it. 12 The fifty-seven which I have seen are: Folger 37, B.M. 4, Trinity College Cambridge 4, Trinity College Dublin 4, Huntington 4, Bodleian 1, Cambridge University 1, Library of Congress 1, Rugby School 1. The nine which I have not seen are: NYPL 6, Harvard 1, Birmingham Public Library (England) 1, University of Virginia 1. 13 The validity of my statistical approach to this question would be affected adversely if it were to be assumed that H. C. Folger was aware of the existence in some copies of the reprinted sheets and made special efforts to acquire copies possessing them, but all indications are that he was not aware of them and that he acquired the four copies just as he did the other thirty-three. The fact that four out of the thirty-seven copies contain F5 sheets, then, is the result of pure chance which might equally well recur in any other thirty-seven copies. I hope that owners or custodians of Fourth Folios not mentioned in note 12 who find F5 sheets will communicate their findings to me or to Professor Bowers or otherwise make them known. 14 The use of 8-point type was first pointed out to me in April 1950 by Professor D. S. Robertson, Vice-Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, who had observed it in a fragment of F4 which he owns.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Chaucer's Lak of Stedfastnesse by George B. Pace</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ALTHOUGH THE BEST MANUSCRIPTS OF LAK of Stedfastnesse are in substantial agreement on most readings, they divide into two groups at lines 5, 10, and 28. One group reads ben no thyng on (l. 5), ffor now adayes, (l. 10), and dryue thi peple (l. 28); the other, Is no thing lyke, For amonge vs now , and wed thi folk . The choice between the first two pairs of readings—everyday phrases, practically synony-mous—is relatively inconsequential. With the third pair, however, the variation between 'drive' and 'wed' considerably affects the interpretation of the poem, for each indicates a different attitude toward kingship. 1 Both sets of readings are in passably Chaucerian English; and previously, so far as manuscript evidence was concerned, editors have virtually been forced to toss a coin when considering these lines. Hence one finds Furnivall, Holt, MacCracken, and Koch supporting the first set; Skeat, Brusendorff, and Robinson, the second; Heath, both (in the belief that they derived from 'separate originals'). 2 With the discovery of a new manuscript, however, it is now possible to show that one set of readings is the work of scribes. This new text—an eighteenth-century transcription of the burnt Cotton manuscript Otho A. XVIII 3 —reads the lines in question as follows: Is no thynge oon, Amonges vs nowe , and dreve thy folke . As a moment's inspection will show, these readings are almost beyond doubt a transition between the two groups of variants given above. It follows, of course, that only one of the two groups can be Chaucerian. But unfortunately the readings from Otho A. XVIII do not reveal which group that is. Even so, the knowledge that one set of variants is of scribal origin is sufficient, I believe, to allow one to solve the problem, and in the end to arrive at a firmly established text for the poem. To accomplish this aim, however, one must analyze anew the Lak of Stedfastnesse manuscripts—a desirable project in any event, for the published studies of the text of this poem are conflicting and incomplete. 4 The authorities for Lak of Stedfastnesse , with their sigils, are: 5 A Additional 22139 .

Th Thynne's printed version, derived from a lost Ms., in The Workes of Geffray Chaucer (London, 1532). Sig. Vvv4 a . If my reasoning is correct, these authorities arrange as follows: I. In explaining the tree, it will be of help to establish first the relationships which depend for their proof solely upon the distribution of the variants, since in so doing we can not only keep distinct the kinds of evidence with which we have to deal but can also reduce the number of texts which need careful consideration from fifteen to seven. These relationships are as follows: (1) H 1 and R 1 share three readings found in no other Ms. and hence must be considered as closely related. Neither, however, can be regarded as descended from the other, for each text reads uniquely in places where the other agrees with the rest of the Mss. First, H 1 's unique readings (R 1 's readings are supported by the other Mss): 3. is fals ; R 1 is so fals . 17. wyght ; R 1 man . 27. thorow all goodnesse ; R 1 trouth and worthynesse . In addition, H 1 reads (with C), 6 in line 19, permutacioun ; R 1 a parmutacone , the reading of all other Mss. Now, this unique reading in R 1 (H 1 's reading is supported by other Mss): 6. by wikked wilfulnesse ; H 1 thorowe mede &amp; wylfullnesse . 7 In addition, R 1 reads (with R 3 ), in line 8, the (H 1 and the rest, this ), and (with L), in line 9, folkes (H 1 and the rest, less R 3 , folke ). These readings are uniquely common to H 1 and R 1 : 2. was holde (R 1 was holde for ). The others read was . 4. werke . The others read dede . 8. H 1 made , R 1 mape . The others read maketh, causep . On the basis of these readings we may assume ex 2 H 1 R 1 (the a of the tree). The significant readings for a are as follows: 8 1. þis worlde was so stedfast and stable. 2. was holde (or was holde for ). 9 3. And . . . so fals and disceyvable. 4. worde and werke as in conclusyone. 5. Beon no thing oon for tourned vp so doune. 6. thorowe mede and wylfulnesse. 8. maþe (or made ) this worlde to be so variable. 9. folk . . . in discencioun. 10. ffor nowe adayes. 11. But if . . . by sum collusyone. 12. Do. 13. What causeþe þis but wilful wrechednesse. 16. Vertue haþe nowe no domynacone. 17. Pytee exyled no man is mercyable. 18. is blent. 19. þe worlde haþe made a parmutacone. 20. frome trouth to fikulnesse. 22. O prynce desyre for to beo honurable. 23. Cherisshe þy folke. 24. may beo. 25. To þyne estate doone in þy Regyoune. 26. Shewe forpe þy swerde of castigacioun. 27. trouth and worþynesse. 28. And dryve þy people ageine to stidfastnesse. (2) As MacCracken has observed, 10 L is apparently an actual copy of Ht, although not a very faithful one. The two texts share three readings not found elsewhere: 3. But (L Byt ) now . The others (less R 3 , Now ) read And now . 12. Do to . The others (less D, To do ) read Do . 13. that . The others (less R 3 , And alle causyht ) read this . Ht has no unique readings. L, however, has the following two, which establish the descent as Ht&gt;L: 11 2. That man ys word ; Ht (and the rest) that mannes word . 13. wrechednesse; Ht (and the rest) wilful wrecchednesse . The significant readings of Ht, so far as they differ from those of a , are as follows: 2. was. 3. But . . . so fals And disceyvable. 4. word and dede as in conclusioun. 6. for mede and wilfulnesse. 8. makith this world to be so variable. 12. Do to . 13. What causeth that but wilful wrecchednesse. 22. O prince desyre to be honurable. 27. trouthe and rightwesnesse. (3) Except for reading uniquely In for To in line 25, R 2 , a fragment consisting only of the envoy, is identical with Co. The significant readings for Co, so far as they differ from those of a , are as follows: 2. was. 4. wurde and dede as yn conclusion. 5. Ys no thynge oon . 6. for mede and wilfulnesse. 8. Whate makith this worled to be varyable . 16. As line 17 . 17. As line 16 : Pitey is so gyled no man is mercyable. 28. dreve thy folke . (4) The two late sixteenth-century texts B and M share nine readings found in no other Ms. Because of the following unique readings in B (where M agrees with the rest of the Mss), we cannot, however, assume the descent B&gt;M: 9. quhilk ; M pat . 16. nane at hir devotioun ; M now na dominatioun . 25. B writes line 26 here. 26. That vertew may rigne within thy regioun; M Schaw furth þi Sworde of castigatioun (D R 3 Th yerde for sworde ). Nor, because of the following unique readings in M (where B agrees with the rest of the Mss), can we assume the descent B&lt;M: 4. deidis ; B deid . 11. Except ; B Bot gif . 19. is ; B hes (= hath ). The following readings are uniquely common to B and M: 4. in conclusioun . The rest read as in conclusioun . 5. bot . The rest read for . 9. B bot discretioun ; M of indescretioun . the rest read in discencion. 12. Doing The rest (less A, Done ) read Do. 13. makis . . . wofull . The rest (less D, causep . . . sotel ) read causeth . . . wilfull . 17. and na man meretabill . The rest (less H 1 , wyght for man , and A, man merciable ) read no man is mercyable . 20. ressone to wilfulnes . The rest read trouth to fikulnesse . 24. be. The rest read may be . In addition, B and M insert a stanza which seems plainly non-Chaucerian immediately before the envoy, and reverse stanzas 2 and 3. On the basis of these readings, we may assume ex 2 B M (the d of the tree). The significant readings for d , so far as they differ from those of a , are as follows: 1. this (M ye) warld so steidfast was &amp; stabill (order). 2. was. 4. word and deid (B adds discordis ) in conclusioun . 5. Ar no thing lyke bot turnd up syd (B up and) doun . 6. for neid (B greid) and wilfulnes . 8. makis pis warld to be so variabill. 9. folk . . . of indiscretioun (B bot discretioun ) 10. Amang ws now. 12. Doing . 13. Quhat makis this bot wofull wretchitnes . 17. Petie exylit and na man meritabill . 18. Blind is . 19. The warld hes maid a permutatioun. 20. fra rasoun to wilfulnes. Non-Chaucerian stanza . 24. be (B bene ) 27. treuth and rychtuousnes. 28. And leid (B bring) þi folk agane to stedfastnes . Stanzas 2 and 3 reversed. (5) R 3 and Th share two readings found in no other Ms. Because of these unique readings in Th (where R 3 and the other Mss agree), we cannot, however, assume the descent R 3 &lt;Th: 12 6. fykelnesse; R 3 wylfulnes . 12. and; R 3 or . As corroborating evidence, one should note that Th reads uniquely an , line 2 and is , line 5, whereas R 3 and the other texts agree in omitting these words. Similarly, we cannot assume the descent R 3 &gt;Th because of unique readings in R 3 (where Th and the rest of the Mss agree): 1. Wylum ; Th Somtyme . 3. Now hyt ysse ; Th And nowe it is . 5. els butt ; Th lyke . 13 13. And alle causyht ; Th What causeth this but . 19. Thys ; Th The . 28. ayeyn thy folke ; Th thy folke ayen . In addition, R 3 reads uniquely, in line 11, maner , which Th omits with all other Mss, and shares with a scattering of texts certain other readings which, since Th's are widely supported, prevent the descent R 3 &gt;Th: 1. was stedefast (with H 2 ); Th so stedfast was . 5. up &amp; don (with B A); Th up so doun . 8. causyht (with D); Th maketh . 27. Ryhtwysnis (with Ht L B M); Th worthynes . These readings are uniquely common to R 3 and Th: 9. men . All other Mss read folke . 10. For amonge vs . The other Mss read ffor among vs now, Among ws now, ffor now adayes . In addition, the following readings, although not uniquely common to R 3 and Th, are evidence for grouping them together: 17. Pyte is exyled (with D). The others (less Co, Pitey is so gyled ) read Pite exiled . 22. Prynce (with A). The others (less D, illegible) read O prince . 26. yerd (with D). The others read sword . On the basis of these readings, we may assume ex 2 R 3 Th (the f of the tree). The significant readings for f , so far as they differ from those of a , are as follows: 1. Somtyme þe world so stedfast was and stable. 2. was. 4. worde and dede as in conclusioun. 5. Is nothyng lyke for turned vp so doun. 8. maketh the worlde to be so variable. 9. men . . . in discensyon. 10. For amonge vs . 17. Pety ys exylyd no man ysse mercyable. 22. Prince desyre to be honourable. 26. Schow forthe thy yerd of castygacyun. 27. trouthe and worthynes (R 3 t. a. Ryhtwysnis.) 14 28. And wedde thy folke ayen to stedfastnesse. (6) H 2 and F share one reading not found elsewhere. Because of the following readings in H 2 (where F and the other Mss agree), we cannot, however, assume the descent H 2 &gt;F: 1. Somme tyme worlde ; F Some tyme the worlde . 5. torneth ; F turned . 16. none ; F noo . In addition, H 2 reads (with A R3), in line 1, was stedfast . F and the other Mss read was so stedfast (B M so steidfast was ). Nor, because of the following unique reading in F (where H 2 and the other Mss agree), can we assume the descent H 2 &lt;F: 10. holde ; H 2 is holde . The following reading is uniquely common to H 2 and F: 3. so fals and so disceyuable . All other Mss omit the second so . Furthermore, except for the readings cited for lines 1, 5, 10, and 16, the text of F and H 2 are identical, frequently even in spelling. On the basis of the above evidence, we may assume ex 2 H 2 F (the g of the tree). The significant readings for g , so far as they differ from those of a , are as follows: 1. Some tyme the worlde was so stedfast and stable. 2. was. 3. And . . . so fals and so disceyuable . 4. word and dede as in conclusyon. 5. Ys noo thing lyke for turned vp so don. 6. for mede and wilfulnesse. 8. maketh this worlde to be so variable. 10. ffor amonge vs nowe. 11. conclusioun. 22. O prince desire to be honourable. 28. And wedde thy folke ayeyne to stedfastnesse. A, C, and g share one reading which seems valid for grouping them together: the obvious error conclusion for collusion in line 11. None of these texts, however, can be the parent of any of the others, g because of its reading in line 3, A and C because of readings elsewhere. The readings which prevent descent from A are: 12. Done . C, g , and the rest (less B M Doing ) read Do . 23. Speke with folke. C, g. , and the rest read Cherice þi folk . The following reading for C, while not unique, prevents one from considering it the parent of any Ms.: 19. permutacioun . A, g , and the rest (less H1) read a parmutacioun . Finally, no two of these Mss can have a common ancestor which excludes the third, since none shares readings with one that it does not also share with the other. We must hence assume ex 2 C A g (the h of the tree). This Ms. differs from g as follows: 3. And . . . so false and disceyuable. 10. ffor among vs now . The reading for line 10, confined to h and its descendants, has become in effect a 'unique reading.' As for the remaining Ms., D, one can deduce from the distribution of the variants alone only that it cannot be the parent of any of the other texts. This we can show by listing the unique readings which it contains: 1-7. Omits the first stanza. 8-28. Begins with the envoy and reverses stanzas 2 and 3. 11. But he can com be sum ymaginacioun . The rest read But yf he can by som collusioun (A C F H 2 L conclusion ). 13. sotel dowblenes . The rest (less B M, wofull wretchitnes ) read wilful wrechidnesse . 15. Troupe is rebuked &amp; reson is hold but fable . The rest read Trouthe is putte doune resoun is holden fable . 25. To your astate wher ye have correctioun . The rest (less B, which reads uniquely) read To thine estaitt doen in þy regioune . 26. your . The rest read thy . 28. &amp; knyt to gydre your peple with stedfastnes . The rest read And wed (Co R 2 Ht L R 1 H 1 drive , B leid , M bring ) thi folke (Ht L R 1 H 1 peple ) ayen to stedfastnesse . Although we cannot relate D to any of the other texts at this point, we can remark that it agrees with Ht a in reading ffor now on dayes (I. 10) and peple (I. 28). We can also note that the general badness of D's text—its beginning with the envoy and proceeding backwards through the next two stanzas, its many unique and obviously incorrect readings—make it unthinkable that D was copied from a Ms. Almost certainly D's scribe was writing from an imperfect memory of the poem. A glance at the italicized lines (indicating unique variants) in the 'significant readings' given above for Ht, Co, D, and the reconstructed parents of H 1 -R 1 , B-M, R 3 -Th, and H 2 -F-A-C will show that none of these can be the parent of any extant text. Hence we have seven authorities, none of which can be directly descended from any of the others. We have carried our study of the relationships of the Mss about as far as we can solely on the basis of the distribution of the variants. We have established certain relationships, and in so doing have reduced our original fifteen authorities to seven—three actual Mss and four postulated ones. If we continue our procedure of determining kinship by shared variants, we soon arrive at the impasse mentioned in the first paragraph of this paper. On the one hand, we have Ht a D reading, in lines 5, 10, and 28, ben no thyng on, ffor now adayes , and dryue thi peple ; on the other, d f h reading Is no thing lyke, For amonge vs now , and wed thi folk . In between lies Co, with its transition readings, Ys no thing oon, Amonges vs nowe , and dreve thy folk , showing that only one of the above sets can be Chaucerian. But the only readings uniquely common to Ht a D are their variants for lines 5, 10, and 28; and, similarly, the only readings uniquely common to d f h are their variants for lines 5, 10, and 28. Distributional study, then, leaves us in a dilemma. If we are to relate the seven authorities to each other, as shown in the tree on page 107, we must seek other means. II. So far we have not examined the headings for the poem. Only five Mss have titles. These are Co Ht L R 1 H 1 —with the exception of Co, the Mss which read ben no thyng on, ffor now adayes , and dryue thi peple . If we study these titles, we find a similarity between them which suggests that the five texts are related closely. Co Balade Ryalle made by Poetecall Chaucyer a Gaufrede. Ht Old title: Chaucier send (no more visible); new title: These balladis were send to the kynge. (L has Ht's second title.) a R 1 Balade Royal made by oure laureall poete of Albyoun in hees laste yeeres. H 1 This balade made Geffrey Chaunciers the laureall poete of Albion and sent it to his souerain lorde kynge Richarde the seconde pane being in his castell of Windesore. We note that the three texts which mention the poet's name spell it - ier , not - er . We also note that Co and R 1 are similar in that each calls the poem a ballad royal, and that Ht and H 1 are alike in asserting that Chaucer sent the poem to the king. Further, since H 1 and R 1 are sister texts on strong evidence, we are justified in assuming that their parent, a , read much as does H 1 but began, say, 'Ballad Royal . . .,' as do R 1 and Co. If we attempt to classify these texts on the basis of their titles, we have the following arrangement: The readings ben no thyng on, ffor now adayes , and dryue thi peple thus appear to have been begun by the scribe who wrote c and then 'improved upon' by the scribe who wrote b . But before accepting this explanation, we should certainly like additional, and stronger, evidence. Nor have we far to go to find it. In the manuscript books of Ht (and L), Co, and H 1 , Lak of Stedfastnesse immediately follows Chaucer's Truth ; in R 1 it immediately precedes it. Again we find a similarity in the titles. 15 More important, however, we find from a purely distributional study of the text that the copies of Truth are related in one or the other of two ways: 16 As one can see, the second tree is identical with that proposed above for Lak of Stedfastnesse . The coincidence between the trees virtually proves that the two poems, side by side in the manuscripts, have the same ancestry. 17 III. There is no evidence whatsoever for the alternate assumption, that the readings Is no thing lyke, For amonge vs now , and wed thi folk are of scribal origin. We may hence assume that Ht and a have a common parent (the b of the tree). Because D also reads ffor now on dayes and peple , I have graphed it as descended from b . 18 The significant readings for b , so far as they differ from those of a , are as follows: 2. was. 4. word and dede as in conclusioun. 6. for mede and wilfulnesse. 8. makith this world to be so variable. Further, for reasons already stated we may assume that b and the transition Ms. Co have an exclusive common ancestor (the c of the tree). Except for the following, the significant readings for c are the same as those for b : 5. Is no thynge oon for turned vppe so down. 10. Amonges vs nowe. 19 28. And dreve thy folke ageyn to stedefastnesse. The readings of c for lines 10 and 22 ( for to be honorable ) are found also in d . In addition, both texts have had trouble with line 28 ( d reads either leid þi folk [M] or bring thy folk [B]). Because of the unique readings listed above for d , however, we cannot assume the descent d &gt; c . Nor can we assume the descent d &lt; c , since c reads, in line 5, oon , which has been shown to be of scribal origin, and d reads lyke , which has been shown to be the reading of the original. Hence we must assume ex 2 c d (the e of the tree). The significant readings for e , so far as they differ from those of c , are these: 5. Is no thynge lyke. 20 28. **** thy folke. V. In the tree I have graphed e, f , and h as descended inde-dently from O. That this conclusion is inescapable the following table shows. The table lists only the readings on which the three texts disagree. e f h 1. this world was so stedfast þe world so stedfast was the worlde was so stedfast 8. this world the worlde this worlde 9. folk men folke 10. Among ws now For amonge vs ffor among vs now 11. collusioun collusioun conclusion 17. exiled is exyled exiled 22. O prince for to be honorable Prince to be honourable O prince to be honurable 26. swerd yerd swerde 28. **** thy folke wedde thy folke wed thi folk As one can see, neither e nor f can be descended from h because of its reading in line 11; neither e nor h can be descended from f because of its readings in lines 1, 2, 9, 10, 22, and 26; and neither f nor h can be descended from e because of its readings in lines 1, 10, and 28. Hence we must assume that all three texts derive independently from 0. VI. We have now completed the explanation of the tree. 21 We have four Mss at one remove from the original—Th R 3 A C. Of these, C is decidedly the best. It is the basis of the text which I now print. [ Lack of Stedfastnesse ] Sumtyme the worlde was so stedfast and stable That mannes worde was obligacioun And nowe it is so false and disceyuable That worde and dede as in conclusioun [5] Is no thing lyke for turned vp so doun Is all this worlde for mede and wilfulnesse That al is lost for lak of stedfastnesse [2] What maketh this worlde to be so variable But lust that folke haue in discencioun [10] For amonge vs now a man is holde vnable But yf he can by som collusioun Do his neyghbour wrong or oppressioun What causeth this but wilful wrechednesse That al is lost for lake of stedfastnesse [3] [15] Trouthe is putte doun resoun is holden fable Vertu hath now no dominacioun Pite exiled no man is merciable Thorugh couetyse is blent discrecioun The worlde hath made a permutacioun [20] Fro right to wrong fro trouth to fikelnesse That al is lost for lak of stedfastnesse [Lenvoy] O prince desyre to be honurable Cherisshe þi folke and hate extorcioun Suffre no thing that may be reprouable [25] To thine estate don in þi regioun Shewe forth thy swerde of castigacioun Drede god do law loue trouthe and worthynesse And wed thi folk ayen to stedfastnesse [Explicit] Although this text is not markedly different from Skeat's or Robinson's, 22 there are a few differences worth noting: 1. the worlde . Skeat and Robinson, this world . 5. Is no thing lyke . Skeat and Robinson, Ben nothing lyk (this reading occurs in no Ms.). 10. For amonge vs now . Skeat, Among us now . 12. Do . Skeat and Robinson, Don (this reading occurs only in A). With the other group of texts—Heath's, Holt's, Koch's, and Mac-Cracken's—the differences are of course numerous, but there seems little point in cataloging them here since the manuscripts on which they based their texts have been shown to be poor authorities. It is interesting, however, and perhaps instructive, to examine the reasoning which led them into error. The last important difference is to be found in the final line of the poem, where Skeat has 'wed thy folk' and I have adopted the reading of the H S Hat [H1 R1 Ht] group, 'Dryve thy people.' . . . The obvious reason why I have adopted the H S Hat reading is that the verb 'Dryve' makes sense where the other does not seem to do so. I quote from line 26: Shew forthe thy swerde of castigacion, Drede god, do lawe, loue trouthe and worthynesse, And dryve thy peple ageyne to stedfastnesse. He is implored to draw his sword and drive the people to stedfastnesse; is this not more sensible than to draw his sword and wed his folk to stedfastnesse? 23 The weakness of this reasoning is apparent if one asks oneself the question, Why should a scribe emend a reading which 'makes sense' to one which 'does not seem to do so'? If one reads the line in its true context, however, 'wed' makes much better sense poetically than 'dryve.' I quote from the beginning of the envoy: O prince desyre to be honurable Cherisshe þi folke and hate extorcioun Suffre no thing that may be reprouable To thine estate don in þi regioun Shewe forth thy swerde of castigacioun Drede god do law loue trouthe and worthynesse And wed thi folk ayen to stedfastnesse Since three scholars have misinterpreted this passage, I hope I may be forgiven for obtruding literary criticism upon a discussion of manuscript relationships. Chaucer asks the king to 'shewe forth' his 'swerde of castigacioun' against those who do things 'that may be reprouable'—the extortioners, the godless, the lawbreakers: the enemies of steadfastness. He can hardly ask the king to cherish his folk in line 23 and five lines later to drive them with the sword. Nor does he, if the analysis in this paper is correct.</field>

XVIII," Speculum, XXVI (1951), 306-316. 4 The following texts were unclassified until the present study: Co, D, M, R2, and the Black Letter prints subsequent to Thynne's (for the meaning of the sigils, see text below). Nine of the remaining authorities were arranged by Koch, and later by Heath, as follows: (1) R 1 H 1 (2) A C F H 2 B R 3 Th. Holt published a similar bifid tree. Brusendorff, who criticized Holt's article severely (and justly), offered a trifid arrangement: (1) A C F H 2 ; (2) H 1 R 1 Ht L; (3) Th R 3 B. (Robinson's brief textual note agrees with Brusendorff's classification. Skeat did not attempt a classification, but his text is similar to Robinson's.) Only Koch, Heath, and Holt published actual trees; only Holt argued in detail. 5 Except for B and D (of which I have only seen photostats), I have examined all of the Mss and have based my study upon my transcriptions of the poem. All the Mss, including the Ms of Co (see fn. 3), however, have been published (for references, see the Brown-Robbins Index of Middle English Verse ). The most important difference between the published transcriptions and my own is in A, the final (envoy) stanza of which the Chaucer Society failed to print. In consequence, the Ms. is always listed as lacking the envoy ( cf. , e. g., Robinson, p. 1037). Except for B (1568) and M (c. 1570), the Mss are from the 15th century; A C F R1 are from the first half. 6 In view of the evidence just given, the agreement with C seems non-significant. For a further discussion of this agreement, and of all other agreements considered non-significant, see fn. 21 below. 7 R 3 thro mede &amp; wylfulnes ; the rest fore mede and wilfulnesse . 8 'Significant' in that at least one Ms. reads differently. (Where no reading is given, the Mss are in agreement.) 9 The italic type indicates that the reading is not found outside the hypothetical Ms. and its descendants. 10 MLN , XXIII (1908), 212-214. 11 In addition, L reads, in 6, In alle thys worle (with A M), and in 11, conclusyoun (with A C F H 2 ); Ht and the rest read Is al this world and collusioun . Although the agreements seem clearly the result of chance (see fn. 21 and 22), they make the descent Ht&lt;L even more unlikely. 12 From Th, however, are ultimately descended the versions of Lak of Stedfastnesse in the Black Letter Chaucers of the 16th and 17th centuries (and also the copy in the Urry Chaucer of 1721). Since these texts are practically identical, they are of no value for this study (for the order of descent, see my article, "The Text of Chaucer's Purse ," [ Studies in Bibliography ], I (1948), 111; the printed versions of the two poems have the same history.) Likewise, the copy of the envoy in Meredith Hanmer's The Auncient Ecclesiasticall Histories (1577) which Miss Spurgeon mentions ( Chaucer Criticism and Allusion , I, 112) is of no value textually. Except for changes in spelling, it is identical with Th. 13 R 3' s reading is virtually illegible ( butt, the most likely guess, is also the reading of the Chaucer Society). 14 The evidence for this line is as follows: Ht d R 3 trouthe and rightwesnesse . The rest (less H 1 ) trouthe and worthynesse . H 1 all goodnesse . As a glance at the tree will show, there is every reason to believe that Chaucer's text read worthynesse ; I hence assume that this was the reading of f . (Brusendorff and Robinson, however, group R 3 Th with B, which reads rychtuousness . While this arrangement may seem to explain the presence of the same variant in R3 and B, it is in fact not an explanation, for it merely shifts the problem from R3's Ryhtwysnis to Th's worthynes . It is now contradicted by the readings which B shares with Co.) 15 Co A balade by Geffrey Chaucier uppon his dethe bedde lyinge in his grete Anguysse . Ht (Old title) Chauncier balade up on his deth bed (new title: Good conseylle; so L also). R 1 Balade þat Chaucier made on his deeth bedde . H 1' s title bears no resemblance to the others ( A Moral Balade of Chaucyre ). 16 Discussed in detail in my article cited above, fn. 3. 17 Although the coincidence seems to be too striking to be due to chance, we cannot positively reject the first tree. Both trees explain the evidence reasonably well, but the first, which requires us to make fewer assumptions, would ordinarily be preferred on the ground of simplicity. Whichever tree we accept, however, these Mss. are obviously very closely related in Truth ; and, in view of the fact that the two poems seem to go as a pair, we are safe in concluding that they are closely related in Lak of Stedfastnesse . 18 But D also shares three readings with R 3 : 8, causep ; 17, is exciled (so Th also); 26, yerde (so Th also); hence D might just as well be graphed, perhaps, as a sister of R3. 19 Despite the for in b 's reading, we can hardly assume that c read, compositely, For amonges vs nowe , since we should then have to assume that Co and d edited identically. Moreover, it is just as easy to believe that b derived For nowe adayes from Amonges vs nowe as from For amonges vs nowe (one automatically supplies for or an equivalent connective). 20 Here a composite reading seems to me to be justified. Ar no thing lyke is most easily explained as a 16th-century 'correction.' 21 But strong contradictory evidence has forced us, from time to time, to regard some readings as non-significant; and since there is no absolute certainty in textual matters, I collect these readings here. Most of them are easily explained as the result of careless copying, of dialect differences, or of time. (1) Careless copying (small changes, roughly synonymous): 1, this for the (A e), wasse stedfast for w. so s. (A H 2 R 3 ); 6, In for Is (A d), thorowe for for (H 1 f); 8, pe for this (R 1 f): 9, han for haue (A F-H 4 Ht); 12, and for or (Co Th); 19, permutacioun for a permutacioun (C H 1 ); 22, Prince for O prince (A f). Here probably also belongs conclusioun for collusioun (L h), 11. (2) Dialect or time: 5, Ar for Is (A d; a 'correction' analogous to the Beon of H 1 R 1 Ht L D); up and doun for up so doun (A B R 3 ); the effect of time upon idiom—cf. M's up syd doun ). The remaining variants are possibly the result of contamination: 27, rightwesnesse for worthynesse (d Ht R 3 ); 8, causep (D R 3 ); 17, is exciled (D R 3 Th); 26, yerde for swerde (D R 3 Th). I have not, however, assumed contamination to explain the first pair, since the only evidence is the one reading and it is capable of another explanation, that of independent editing. Although one may hesitate to adopt this explanation, he has, I feel, good grounds for making it here. First, the nature of the variant itself. The number of metrically satisfactory substitutes for worthynesse is extremely small. Hence if any number of scribes decide to emend the reading (because, say, their copy is illegible), the chances are that a large proportion of them will hit upon rightwesnesse . Further, 'truth and righteousness' has a kind of obvious force which 'truth and worthyness' lacks, and thus might seem to a scribe an improvement worth making. Second, the nature of the Mss reading rightwesnesse . Ht has every appearance of being a faithful copy. R3, however, is quite corrupt and is clearly not the work of a professional scribe (it is written on a flyleaf of a book of medical receipts and is preceded by a stanza, likewise corrupt, from Gentilesse ). Such variants as Wylum for Sumtyme (1), no thyng els butt for no thing lyke (5), and by sum maner colusyon for by som collusioun (11) show that R 3 's scribe was either having difficulty reading his copy or was writing from memory. As for the third Ms, d , which survives in the late 16 century texts B and M, emendation seems almost to have been the rule (see p. 110 above). At least in R 3 and d , then, it is not surprising to find some other reading than worthynesse , and, since the substitutes are few, not especially surprising to find rightwesnesse in both. Nor have I assumed contamination to explain the agreements between D and R 3 (Th). It is quite possible that D's scribe was familiar with two versions of the poem and that these had fused in his very faulty memory. But with two such corrupt texts as D and R 3 , a question mark, I feel, more exactly expresses the situation than a dotted line. Whether or not my reasoning in this footnote is correct, I should like to express indebtedness, for the method I have employed, to two articles, one by Sir Walter Greg, "The Rationale of Copy-text," and the other by A. A. Hill, "Some Postulates for Distributional Study of Texts," Studies in Bibliography , III (1950), 19-36, and 63-95. 22 Although he did not classify the Mss, Skeat correctly chose C as his basic text. Robinson concluded that neither R1-H1 nor C-A-F-H2 is consistently superior, but in most cases gave preference to the latter group. 23 I quote from Holt ( op. cit. , p. 431). Heath and Koch reason similarly, but Mac-Cracken does not say why he chose H1 for his text.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Milton and Machiavelli's Discorsi by Maurice Kelley</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN MILTON'S COMMONPLACE BOOK APPEAR SEVENTEEN notes on his reading in Machiavelli's Discorsi; 1 but on the date at which Milton dictated these entries, scholars have not agreed. In his classic study of the Commonplace Book, Hanford 2 implied that the notes were entered sometime within the eleven-year period between 1648/9 and 1660, possibly between 1648/9 and 1652. Liljegren, 3 Haller, 4 and Fink, 5 however, have offered the entries as proof that Milton knew Machiavelli in the early 1640's and derived from his writings some of the ideas found in the anti-espiscopal tracts. And Bryant, 6 finally, has argued that Milton's knowledge of the Discorsi came "relatively late" in the poet's career. In their discussions, however, none of these scholars has given close attention to the handwriting found in the entries and in other Milton manuscripts; and preserved at Oldenburg are certain of Milton's private letters in which the handwriting enables us to date the Discorsi notes with some degree of assurance within a fairly limited space of time. None of these seventeen entries is in Milton's autograph. They are rather all the work of his amanuenses, though the exact number of these scribes I have not been able to determine. Certain of the notes show significant similarities of handwriting which indicate that these entries constitute groups, or blocks of notetaking, made by a single scribe at a single sitting. 7 But while these groups tend to differ from one another in general appearance, they sometimes show similarities of letter formation and habits of lifting the pen which suggest that in some instances the notes were written by scribes who employed more than one style of handwriting. 8 In this puzzling complex of hands, however, there are two clearly distinguishable groups which would seem to furnish clues as to the date at which Milton dictated the whole corpus of his Discorsi notes. The first of these is the group listed in footnote 7 as Group 2. In chronological order of entry, it is probably the second set of notes dictated by Milton; 9 and it consists of two notes on p. 197 of the Commonplace Book under the heading "De Religione quatenus ad Rempub: spectat". Both notes derive from Milton's reading of Book I, chapter 10 of the Discorsi , and both are written in a sharp, angular hand, that of Milton's nephew, Edward Phillips. 10 Likewise in Phillips' hand is the original of Milton's letter to Mylius, numbered in the Columbia edition FE., LXIII, 11 and preserved in the Niedersächsische Staatsarchiv at Oldenburg under the pressmark Bestd. 20 (Grafschaft Oldenburg), Tit. 38, No. 73, Fasc. 5, no. 8. As Plate I reveals, the Commonplace Book note and the letter show the same angularity of script and the same idiosyncrasies of formation in certain individual letters: for instance, the M with the slanted serif in "Machiavel." and "Miltonio" and the t in "mortales" and "postquam", which resembles somewhat the figure 4 . The date of the letter, as Plate I also shows, is "Feb: 13 tio 1651", that is, 1652. The second of these two clearly distinguishable groups is that listed in footnote 7 as Group 9. In chronological order, it seems the last of Milton's Discorsi entries; and it consists of a single note on p. 198, deriving from Milton's reading of Book III, chapter 34 of the Discorsi . The scribe of Group 9 has yet to be identified; but as Plate III shows, his hand likewise appears in the original of Milton's letter to Mylius numbered in the Columbia edition FE., LVII, 12 and preserved at Oldenburg as Bestd. 20 (Grafschaft Oldenburg), Tit. 38, No. 73, Fasc. 5, no. 6. This same scribe also wrote at least four other of Milton's letters to Mylius not reproduced here but numbered in the Columbia edition FE., L, LIIa, LV, and LIX, 13 and preserved under the same pressmark at Oldenburg as nos., 3, 4, 5, and 7. The dates of these five letters run from November 7, 1651, to February 10, 1652. 14 Such, then, are the similarities that exist between the handwriting found in two groups of the Discorsi notes and in six of the Milton letters preserved in the Oldenburg archives; and these similarities would seem to suggest the following conclusions. Between November 7, 1651, and February 13, 1652, Milton had in his service two amanuenses to whom he dictated six of his letters to Mylius written between those two dates. To these scribes, he also dictated two of the nine groups of his notes from Machiavelli, for their hands are found not only in the six letters but also in Groups 2 and 9 of the Discorsi entries. The hands of these two scribes, furthermore, appear in conjunction only in these two instances 15 — in the Mylius correspondence and in the Discorsi notes. We may assume, therefore, that the letters and the two groups of notes belong to the same period of Milton's intellectual activities. And since the Group 2 and the Group 9 entries seem to represent not only the second but also the ninth and last stage of Milton's recorded reading in Machiavelli's treatise, we may likewise assume that the whole body of Discorsi notes belong close to, if not actually within, this same period. If these two assumptions are justified—and they do not seem contrary to the logic of historical inference—, then the seventeen entries from Machiavelli's Discorsi should be tentatively assigned to the four-month period covered by the letters, to November and December, 1651, and January and February, 1652. And there these entries should remain until new evidence shows clearly that they belong to a different period of Milton's studies and political evolution.</field>

Horwood (1876), facsimile edition, pp. 148, 185, 193, 195 (two entries), 197 (two entries), 198 (three entries), 242 (three entries), 243 (two entries), 245, 246. 2 PMLA, XXXVI (1921), 281-283. 3 Studies in Milton (Lund, 1918), p. xviii. 4 The Rise of Puritanism (1938), p. 316. 5 The Classical Republicans (1945), p. 98. 6 MP , XLVII (1950), 217-221. 7 I suggest the following groups. Group 1: two notes from Discorsi I, 2 and I, 4 on pp. 193, 246 of the Commonplace Book. Group 2: two notes from I, 10 on p. 197. Group 3: two notes from I, 2 and I, 10 on p. 195 and index entry for Group 2 on index page of Commonplace Book. Group 4: two notes from I, 58 and I, 59 on pp. 185, 245, with the difference in appearance of the two notes resulting from the fact that the note on p. 185 has been crowded in between two earlier entries. Group 5: four notes from I, 58, II, 10, and II, 12 on p. 198, 243, 148, 242. Group 6: two notes from II, 18 and II, 19 on pp. 242, 243. Group 7: note from II, 24 on p. 242. Group 8: note from III, 1 on p. 198. Group 9: note from III, 34 on p. 198. 8 The close similarity of the cancelled note on p. 193 and the recopied form of it on p. 195 offers convincing proof that Groups 1 and 3 are by the same scribe; and a comparison of words and word forms common to these two groups and to Groups 4, 6, and 9 (the citations of Machiavelli, the words for "prince", and inflectional endings, such as "-are" and "-ere") suggests that Groups 4 and 6 are perhaps, and Group 9 very likely, also the work of the Groups 1 and 3 scribe. For a somewhat different, but likewise tentative, grouping, see Hanford, loc. cit. 9 Both the reading and the dictation of the notes seem for the most part to have been done consecutively. The position of the notes on p. 198 indicates that the entry from I, 58 (Group 5) was made earlier than the entry from III, 1 (Group 8) and III, 34 (Group 9), and the index entry for the two notes from I, 10 on p. 197 (Group 2) was made by the scribe who entered the notes from I, 2 and I, 10 on p. 195 (Group 3). Normally the scribe writing the heading of the new page was responsible also for the index entry in the back of the book; but the Group 2 scribe failed to make this entry, and it was left for the Group 3 amaneunsis to supply this omission later. This fact would seem to establish the priority of Group 2 to Group 3 even though the notes overlap. The two Group 2 notes, which come from Discorsi I, 10, derive from passages printed on pp. 56 and 60 of volume II of the Opere di Niccolò Machiavelli , Milano, 1804, while the note in Group 3 from I, 10 comes from a passage printed on p. 59 of the same volume. The work of the Group 3 scribe seems to have been that of gathering up loose ends: the recopying of the I, 2 note that he had entered on the wrong page while making the Group 1 notes, and the entering of a new note from a chapter already covered by the Group 2 scribe. A similar overlapping is present in Groups 4 and 5. The Group 5 entry from I, 58 on p. 198 of the Commonplace Book derives from earlier pages of the Opere than does the second entry in Group 4, but I have put Group 5 later than Group 4 because the other three entries in Group 5 come much later in the Opere than the second Group 4 entry. 10 Plate I shows only the first of these two notes, but those who wish to check the similarity of the handwriting found in the two notes may consult the facsimile edition of the Commonplace Book, cited in note 1. Compare, for instance, "Religione" and "esse" as they appear in both entries, and "laudatiores", "Respub:", and "Machiavel. discors l. 1. c. 10" in the first entry with "laudat", "Repub:", and "Machiavellus . . . discors. l. 1. c. 10" in the second. Horwood identified the scribe of these two notes as Daniel Skinner. Hanford, however, rejected this identification and suggested, "though not without hesitation," that the amanuensis was Edward Phillips. As a comparison of Plates I and II shows, Skinner's script is less angular and more ornate than that appearing in the Commonplace Book notes and in the example of Phillips' hand reproduced in Plate II. For further data on the autographs of Skinner and Phillips, see Sotheby, Ramblings in the Elucidation of the Autograph of Milton (1861), pp. 162, Plate XX, 190, Plate XXIV; and Darbishire, The Early Lives of Milton (1932), p. xvi and plate facing p. 12. 11 XII, 374, 411. 12 XII, 362, 410. 13 XII, 348-50, 352-54, 360, 368-70, 408-11. 14 To this same scribe may also belong a seventh letter, FE., LXV, noted in the Columbia edition, XII, 376, 411-12, preserved as no. 9 under the same Oldenburg pressmark, and dated "Feb. 21 mo 1651", that is 1652. In the six Oldenburg letters we have a fairly clear case of a scribe who writes in more than one hand. The hand appearing in FE., L differs considerably from the hand appearing in FE., LV; but the two hands appear juxtaposed in the text of FE., LIIa, which seems to be the work of only one scribe. To my knowledge, none of these letters has been reproduced except the seventh, LXV, which appeared in facsimile in The New York Times , Dec, 31, 1927; but anyone wishing to check my conclusion that these letters are all by the same scribe, who also made the Group 9 entry in the Commonplace Book, should compare the Group 9 entry with "inserere", "dare", "perlegendam", "prolixiorem", "quandoquidem", "rem", and "remittatur" appearing in FE., LV, and "Comitem", "qua", and "rem" in FE., LVII, with "quam" and "res" in FE., LIX. 15 The two hands may possibly appear singly elsewhere in the Milton manuscripts. Darbishire ( The Manuscript of Milton's Paradise Lost Book I , [1931], pp. xx-xxi) suggests that Edward Phillips's hand appears in the corrections of the text found in the manuscript of Book I of Paradise Lost , and the handwriting of the Group 9 scribe is somewhat suggestive of that found in the May 2, 1652 entry in the Milton family Bible and in the transcript of the Vane sonnet in the Trinity College, Cambridge, manuscript, which is to be dated July, 1652 or slightly earlier.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A Possible New Source for Servius Danielis on Aeneid III-V by Arthur Frederick Stocker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE TEXT FOR THAT FORM OF THE SERVIAN commentaries on Vergil which is known from the name of its first editor 1 as Servius Danielis rests on an exceedingly slim manuscript foundation. Moreover different manuscripts constitute the basis for the text on the Eclogues and Georgics, Aeneid I-II, and Aeneid III-XII, respectively, from which it may perhaps be inferred that there occurred at some point in the tradition a division into what became archetypal volumes, whence the text descended along separate lines. A careful description of these manuscripts has been published by Professor J. J. H. Savage. 2 The extent of Servius Danielis is considerably greater than that of the vulgate Servius. The relation between the two can best be seen by examining the pages of the single published volume of the so-called "Harvard Servius ," 3 the only edition purporting to do full justice to both forms of the commentary without prejudging their respective claims to venerability. It will be found that they have a great many scholia in common. These the Harvard editors print the full width of the page. Others are peculiar to one or the other form of the commentary—many (accounting for its greater total length) to Servius Danielis, a few to the vulgate Servius. These the Harvard editors print in columns three-quarters the width of the page, Servius Danielis flush with the left margin, vulgate Servius flush with the right. Still others embody what appears to be parallel comment on the same passage in Vergil, and are printed side by side in half-width columns, Servius Danielis again on the left and vulgate on the right. From the moment of the appearance of Servius Danielis there has been the greatest diversity of opinion concerning the origin and value of the additional scholia. Daniel himself thought that his Servius auctior was, if not the genuine commentary of Servius, at least a better representative of it than the vulgate, which he viewed as an abridgment, like Paulus' of Festus, that had driven the original almost or entirely out of circulation. Thilo, on the other hand, whose late nineteenth-century edition of Servius 4 has hitherto been standard, saw in the Danieline additions merely interpolations gleaned from various sources and more or less artfully grafted upon Servius. From this understanding of the matter he took license to butcher Servius Danielis sometimes beyond recognition in tailoring it to fit the convenience of a vulgate-centered edition. It may be taken as established by modern scholarship 5 that the new material presented by Servius Danielis is not a miscellany of ancient lore, but derives from a single source, the antiquity of which is attested by, among other things, the large number of citations of authors whose works were quite certainly no longer extant even in the early Middle Ages. Further, this source seems quite clearly to have been an entirely different commentary on Vergil, some characteristics of which, as distinguished from those of Servius', can still be discerned. To mention only an obvious one, cross-references within the additamenta show that the unidentified commentary treated the works of Vergil in the order Eclogues, Georgics, and Aeneid , whereas Servius dealt with them in the sequence Aeneid, Eclogues , and Georgics . Servius Danielis, then, represents a contaminatio , or fusion, of the genuine (essentially the vulgate) commentary of Servius with some other ancient commentary, of which we may say that it is probably more ancient than Servius' own, probably one from which Servius himself drew extensively enough so that there were long passages of coincidence suggesting the possibility of combining the two in a composite edition, and probably not the lost commentary of Aelius Donatus on Vergil, as Professor Albert H. Travis has shown by a careful comparison of the style of Servius Danielis with that of Aelius Donatus' extant commentary on Terence. 6 Adopting the terminology of Barwick and Rand, 7 we may call the non-Servian forebear of Servius Danielis D, the vulgate Servius S, and Servius Danielis, as a composite of the two, DS. If what has been said about the nature of DS is true, and if DS possesses, as it were, an integrity of its own, it becomes manifestly important that its text be constituted with all possible accuracy, a thing that Thilo did not even aspire to do. The attempt to accomplish this, however, runs immediately a-foul of the difficulty inherent in the small body of manuscript evidence. For Aeneid III-V, to which I confine myself in this study, there is only one complete DS manuscript, the Bernensis, bibl. publ. 172 (saec. IX/X), which Thilo designates by the siglum F. Others provide only occasional help: a Leidensis, bibl. publ. Voss. F 79 (saec. IX ex.), which contains an exceedingly meagre abridgment of DS text; a "Virgil of Tours" (Bernensis, bibl. publ. 165, saec. IX), 8 in the margins of which, along with a great deal of miscellaneous matter, are found bits of DS; and a puzzling manuscript of Cassel (bibl. publ. ms. poet. fol. 6, saec. IX/X), which merits an article by itself for the DS affinities which it exhibits in what, by "Harvard" usage described above, would be common or parallel text, but for the most part does not include the DS additions to the Servian vulgate. There is a fifth manuscript, another Bernensis, bibl. publ. 167, approximately contemporary with F (saec. IX/X), which has been found to contain a little over half of the DS scholia found in F . Its value Thilo specifically denies, stating (without proof) that it is, in a very unusual way hereinafter to be described, a copy of F, 9 and in this he is supported by Savage, at least so far as the Aeneid is concerned. 10 A contrary view, however, has been held by Hagen 11 and Funaioli, 12 working with the commentary on the Eclogues and Georgics , and, in view of the new importance assumed by DS in the light of the discoveries of Barwick and his successors, 13 it seems worth while to re-examine the whole question of the relationship between these two manuscripts with the hope of vindicating the authority of Bern. 167 (which may be called G ) as a new witness to the DS text for the Aeneid . For purposes of this inquiry, I have in my possession photographs of both manuscripts for Aeneid III, 1-707, and Aeneid V, 9-826, 14 within which limits I have personally re-collated their text. I have also been aided by having the photographs of all the other important Servius manuscripts for Aeneid III and V, both the DS and the S, so that I have been able to weigh the testimony of F and G in the light of the full tradition. Finally, loan has been made to me of some unpublished notes of the late Professor E. K. Rand, of Harvard University, and Mr. George B. Waldrop, of Shady Side Academy, Pittsburgh, who once undertook but did not complete a similar study, using a much smaller section of text 15 as their sample. To these and to conversations with both of the gentlemen mentioned I am indebted for many stimulating suggestions. F and G have both been described by Savage. 16 F has text in three columns. The center column is occupied by the text of Vergil, with ordinarily twenty-four lines to a page. The outer columns contain the scholia of Servius Danielis. The scribe followed no principle that I have been able to discover in assigning scholia to one column or the other. Since the order of the scholia was in most cases clearly fixed by the order of occurrence in Vergil of the words that were being commented upon, it was not important that he should. His sole consideration seems to have been to transcribe each note as near as possible to the line of Vergil in which the lemma occurred, and he used whichever margin afforded the requisite amount of space. G , on the other hand, has text in two columns, the inner one (as the book was bound) containing the text of Vergil, usually with thirty to thirty-three lines on a page, and the outer one something more than half of the DS scholia ad loc . At first glance, the selection seems quite arbitrary, but as long ago as 1867 it was noted by Hermann Hagen, cataloguer of the manuscripts at Bern, 17 in his edition of the so-called Bern scholia to the Eclogues and Georgics , 18 that, with very few exceptions, 19 the scholia in G are the ones found in the left margin of F . So scrupulous was the scribe of G to reproduce all of these that on occasion, when space failed him, he went so far as to transcribe on scraps of parchment, now interlarded with the gatherings of G , notes for which otherwise he would have had no room, 20 and we may theorize that on other occasions, when there is a break in G in what would be the sequence of scholia from the left margin of F , he did the same thing, but the scraps have since become lost. 21 Scholia found in the right margin of F , however, he disregarded so systematically that I have found only three of them in G within the entire compass of Aeneid III and V. 22 Over the intriguing question why and under what circumstances anyone should so undiscerningly have perpetuated about half of the DS commentary and ignored the rest it is not necessary to linger. Perhaps the scribe had in mind some other manuscript, in which there really was a distinction between scholia of one sort in one margin, and of another in the other. It is, of course, true that the present state of G would be explained if the scribe who made this unfortunate selection had been copying directly from F . The distribution of scholia between the left and right margins of F , however, is quite as likely to derive from F 's source as to have been original with F itself, and the coincidence which we observe proves nothing more than that the two manuscripts are in the same line of descent. The same may be said of the large number of demonstrably corrupt readings which they share. In Aeneid III and Aeneid V alone, I have noted several hundred, of which I cite only a few as examples: A.

V, 810 (Th. 650, 21) magnoque] manoque F G They establish beyond peradventure the existence of a close family relationship between F and G , but they afford no support for the contention of Thilo and Savage, that G is a copy of F . It is, as every textual critic knows, exceedingly difficult to prove that one text was taken from another, in the absence of direct evidence on the point. There are at least two minimum requirements, one positive, the other negative. Positively, there must be a substantial number of false readings in the supposed copy which could most readily be explained from some ambiguity or peculiarity that might plausibly be considered unique in the supposed original. Negatively, there must be an absence in the alleged copy of correct readings not found in the suspected source (except such as might be the product of scribal emendation). Even if these two conditions are met, the hypothesis remains vulnerable to attack from many quarters, as, for example, if it can be shown that the "copy" contains any considerable number of divagations that would not normally result from copying this "original," but would be likely if the scribe had been looking at another kind of script. Of "positive" indications that the scribe of G was copying from F , a few can be cited: A. III, 67 (Th. 349, 20) possessio] F possessi G . There is a dot under the 'o' in F , probably accidental, which might easily be mistaken by a copyist for the sign of deletion. A, III, 67 (Th. 349, 21) nisi . . . nutriatur (23). SVPREMVM (350, 15) non . . . clamat] F om. G . This is an exact line in F . A. III, 68 (Th. 350, 16) CIEMVS] F Genus G . The 'C' and the 'i' run together in F so as to resemble a 'G' in square capitals. A. III, 93 (Th. 358, 1) SVMMISSI] Summis si F Summissi si G. F's only error is in word division, but a copyist, seeing "Summis," might easily have corrected it from Vergil into "Summissi," and then retained the detached "si." A. III, 135 (Th. 368, 12) SVBDVCTAE] F subducitæ G. F uses the familiar 'oc' form of 'a', which might have deceived a copyist into thinking that the preceding letter, actually a 't', was an 'i', while the cross stroke went with the first loop of the 'a' to form a 't'. A. III, 229 (Th. 382, 26) veni . . . rursum prius (27)] F om. G. The omission is easy, by homœoteleuton, but particularly if one is copying from F , where "rursum ueni interdum" occurs at the beginning of one line and "rursum ueni etiam" at the beginning of the next. A. III, 272 (Th. 388, 22) LAERTIA] F Tertia G. F uses a rustic capital 'L', topped with what might easily be mistaken for the horizontal stroke of a rustic capital 'T'. It also represents the 'AE' (here, of course, not a diphthong) by 'e' with a cedilla, which mediæval scribes, notoriously careless about diphthongs, were prone to overlook. A. III, 337 (Th. 403, 1) prosperi . . . præstitit (3)] F om G . This again is an exact line of F . A. III, 351 (Th. 404, 15) aut prius ] F autem G . Over the 't' of F , in the line above, happens to stand a 'p' with the cross stroke through its shaft, the regular symbol for "per." A copyist might take this for a horizontal stroke over the 't' of "aut," which would be the regular suspension for "autem." A. III, 420 (Th. 417, 22) imitatur] F mitatur G . Over the 'i' of F , in the line above, is a 'q' with so long a shaft that the 'i' looks not unlike a continuation of this shaft. A. III, 500 (Th. 428, 25) Roma] F romam G . A loop in the symbol for "pro," occurring in F directly over the 'a' of "Roma," might have been mistaken by the copyist of G for a stroke over the 'a', which would be the normal suspension for "Romam." A, V, 245 (Th. 615, 26) navali] F naualim G. F again has been guilty only of wrong word division. It has "naualim" at the end of one line and "nesteus" at the beginning of the next, where clearly the division should be "nauali mnesteus." G has "naualim mnesteus." He might have taken "naualim" from F , just as he saw it, and then made the easy emendation of "nesteus" to "mnesteus." None of these is conclusive. The two most significant are the cases (A. III, 67; A. III, 337) where G omits, for no discernible palæographical reason, exact lines of the text as it appears in F . The first of these is an uncommonly long line at the foot of the page, extending the width not only of the "left margin" but also of the center column used for Vergil. The second is a normal line, consisting of 46 letters. These two, however, are not the only cases of the apparently inadvertent omission in G of short bits of text that stand in F . 23 Disregarding some that result from homoeoteleuton (which might deceive any scribe, regardless of the text from which he was copying) 24 and a few that may have been deliberate (on account of the scribe's reluctance to attempt the transcription of Greek, 25 I have found four that closely parallel the ones which have been cited, and a fifth that partially does so: A. III, 46 (Th. 344, 18) seges . . . puerum] F om. ( mg. suppl. ) G . This is not a line of F . As spelled out in F , the omission is one of 47 letters. A. III, 48 (Th. 345, 2) victa . . . obrutum] F om. ( mg. suppl. ) G . Again, not a line of F and an omission of about the same length (46 letters in F ). A. III, 141 (Th. 369, 21) consentiat . . . tantum] F om. ( mg. suppl. ) G . These words come from the middle of a long line in F . In F they total 46 letters. A. III, 477 (Th. 425, 18) Adelphis . . . dicit] F om. ( mg. suppl. ) G . Not a line in F . 52 letters. A. III, 241 (Th. 384, 21) quod . . . geritur] F om. ( mg. suppl. ) G . 20 letters at the end of a scholion, divided in F between two lines. The first four of these are about of a length (47, 46, 46, 52 letters). They can be explained most easily on the assumption that the writer of G missed a whole line of his original. If that is so, his original was not F . If his original was not F , however, it must have been a manuscript very much like it, to account for the regularity with which he reproduces only those scholia that appear in the left margin of F . It must have been a manuscript which, like F , had space in the scholia column for about 46 letters to the line. It may even have been the source of F . We may theorize that in seven instances the eye of the writer of G skipped over a whole line in his exemplar. Two of these happen also to be whole lines in F , as would be natural enough if G 's exemplar was the parent of F also. By the theory, the passage from A. III, 241, would be an incomplete line in the original of G . The evidence of omissions, then, would, if my reasoning is correct, serve to refute rather than to support the contention that G was taken directly from F . The rest of the evidence comprising "positive" support for this thesis carries little more conviction. "Possessi" (A. III, 67) may have been the reading that was seen by both F and G ; G adopted it, F (copying with an eye for the sense) emended almost unconsciously to "possessio," but then perhaps caught himself and deleted the 'o'. Haplographies (A. III, 420; A. V, 245) and dittographies (A. III, 93) are common enough in all conditions of text, as are omissions by homoeoteleuton (A. III, 229). "Aut" and "autem" (A. III, 351) are very frequently confused in text transmission. 26 G 's "subducitæ" (A. III, 135) suggests compellingly only that G was copied from some text using the 'oc' or 'cc' form of 'a', or perhaps the Beneventan form of 't', which we shall see later is likely on other grounds. 27 Only G 's "Genus" (A. III, 68), "Tertia" (A. III, 272), and "romam" (A. III, 500) remain to point the finger at F , and on these not much of a case can be built. Negatively, the postulate of direct descent fares no better. It is true that G makes few substantial improvements upon the readings of F . In view of the closeness of the relationship clearly existing between them, it should not be expected that it would. It is true, too, that the individual errors of G are much more numerous than the individual errors of F. F is the better manuscript. Apart, however, from what may be taken as easy scribal emendations, G is in some instances undoubtedly correct where F is in error: A. III, 10 (Th. 336, 3) Ilium] G illum F A, III, 16 (Th. 338, 11) felicitate] (i supra alt. e ss. ) G felicitati F A. III, 246 (Th. 385, 11) volatu] G uoluto in uolutu ( in ras. ) F A.

V, 229 (Th. 614, 16) teneant] G eaeneant ( in æneant) F A. V, 295 (Th. 619, 2) Sallustius] salustius G saltius F A. V, 324 (Th. 621, 2) a] G ad F A. V, 489 (Th. 629, 11) pro nominibus] G pro pronominibus F A. V, 823 (Th. 652, 1) recepisse] G recipis se F A. V, 823 (Th. 652, 2 in app.) herbam] G hebam ( in hesbam) F Moreover, it contains a few passages of text that are not found in F at all: A. III, 394 (Th. 412, 9) vel . . . timeas] G om. F To be sure, the words come at the end of a line in G and might have been added later. There is, however, nothing in the photograph to suggest that they are the work of other than the original hand. Thilo accepts them as authentic DS. A. III, 475 (Th. 425, 3) Scytha] ferenti uel furenti id est flanti. id est digne habito uel exaltato add. G This is a hodge-podge and certainly not correct DS ad loc . The first part of it is a gloss on "ferenti" (A. III, 473), and the second on "dignate" (A. III, 475). Neither has anything to do with what goes before. But the important thing for our purposes is that G writes it directly after "Scytha," and takes two lines to it. He must have gotten it from his original, and it is not in F . A. III, 576 (Th. 439, 25) ructatur] uel eruit add. G A. III, 629 (Th. 446, 14) Ithacensis] uel ita fensis ulixes add. G Although both of the foregoing are sheer nonsense and occur at the end of a line of text where they might have been added subsequently, the photographs give no indication that they are the work of other than the original hand. A. V, 790 (Th. 649, 7) QVAM MOLEM ut . . . moles] (tantis pro tantas) G om. F This looks like a clear case of a scholion in G that is not in F —certainly not where G would have looked for it in F , if he had been copying from that source, for F's left hand margin opposite the "Quam molem" in Vergil is entirely blank. By way of qualification to the force of this example, it must be said that the page in F is badly faded and could not very satisfactorily be photographed. It is barely possible that the note may have appeared in some part of the page that cannot now be read. Instances of these two types are clearly fatal to the hypothesis that G was taken directly from F . To complete the refutation, it is possible to cite an imposing number of cases where G is corrupt and F affords no grounds whatsoever for misunderstanding. A conspicuous example occurs early in Aeneid III, where F carries in the left margin the note, HOSPITIVM ANTIQVVM aut carum . . . regi (A. III, 15; Th. 338, 4-6), followed by the note on DVM FORTVNA FVIT (A. III, 16; Th. 338, 10). Between the two notes, as a sign of cross-reference from the lemma in Vergil, F has the symbol '·d·', so that the apparatus entry must read: regi. DVM] regi ·d· Dum F Since the insertion of such signs of cross-reference between two scholia, continuously presented, is unusual, we should not be surprised to find confusion in any manuscript copied from F , but certainly not the corruption found in G : regi. DVM] regium ( corr. ) G Other aberrations in G point to the presence in G's original of well known palæographical difficulties that are absent in F , e. g., A. III, 172 (Th. 374, 24} A. III, 359 (Th. 406, 5} dicit] F (written out in full) dr G A. III, 414 (Th. 416, 7} (sc. "dicitur") To make this mistake, the scribe of G must have had before him an original in which "dicit" was abbreviated as 'dt', with the horizontal stroke for a compendium over the 't'. Minuscule 't' and minuscule 'r' are readily confused. A. III, 73 (Th. 351, 9) Asterien] F asarien G The letters 'te', run together, can look very much like a flat topped 'a', and G must come from something on that order to contain the mistake it does. In F , however, the 'st' is ligatured and a plain 'e' follows, leaving no room for misunderstanding. A. V, 59 (Th. 597, 24) Anchise] F atichise G The letter 'n' and the letters 'ti', in ninth century script and when laterally compressed, can sometimes look very much like one another, but they do not in F , where the 'n' is unusually distinct. A. III, 607 (Th. 444, 13) vastoque . . . iuvabit] &amp; rł usque periisse iuuabit F &amp; rł quisq; perisse iudicabit G The scribe of G must have been copying from an original that used "et rłq" rather than "et rł" for "et reliqua." A. V, 380 (Th. 624, 3) dicat alacer tamen] (with correct word division) F dica ala certam G A. V, 553 (Th. 633, 19) certe] F arce G A. V, 238 (Th. 615, 5) iaciam] iaceā F iacet G In all three of the foregoing, G's difficulty apparently derives from misunderstanding of the 'oc' Beneventan form of 'a' and the very similar Beneventan form of 't'. In the first example, this could very easily have resulted in the loss of the 't' (between two 'a's) in "dicat alacer." In the second, the writer of G mistook a real 'c' for the initial loop of an 'oc'-type 'a'. In the third, there is simple confusion between 'a' and 't'. In each case, the script of F is plain. A. III, 645 (Th. 448, 7) ratione] F ratiore G A. V, 80 (Th. 601, 19) bonos ter enuntiatum] honeste renunciatē F honeste nentiatē G Both of these cases reflect confusion in G resulting from the similarity between 'n' and 'r' in insular script. The mistake could not have been made by a scribe who was copying from F . 28 A. III, 631 (Th. 446, 17) iacere] a sobriis cubandum (culiandum G ) ostendit temulentos iacere add. F G The interesting point is the divergence in G from F's "cubandum." F's 'b' is unmistakable, but 'b' in insular script can very easily be taken for 'li'. There is a very similar case on A. V, 15 (Th. 590, 7) where, at "obliquatque," F fell into the trap and reads "obbquat que." G does much better, with "obliquat q". To conclude, G is not a copy of F . Its similarities with F are so striking, however, as to suggest that both were copied from the same source—more cursive in style and exhibiting, it may be, a mixture of Italian and insular traits. F was the more careful of the two copies. Hence it is that, when F and G diverge, F is much more likely to be correct, and that there are a substantial number of omissions in G of text that appears in F , as compared with rather few and dubious instances of the reverse situation. Clearly G is a new source for Servius Danielis on Aeneid III-V, although its relationship to F is so close that it cannot be expected to contribute very materially to the establishment of the text.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Early American Power Printing Presses by Ralph Green</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PRINTERS HAD LABORED AT THE OLD WOODEN hand press for three hundred and fifty years, and it was time for someone to make improvements. The age of machinery was dawning. Here and there—in Europe, England, and America—some inventive mechanic would experiment, but the lack of sufficiently accurate machine tools, and the disposition of printers to avoid change, served as a drawback. In Hartford, Conn., Dr. Appolos Kinsley, in 1796 made a machine press, entirely new in principle, which had a predicted speed of 2000 sheets per hour, as compared to 200 or 250 for the hand press. From the description, it must have looked like the modern Miehle Vertical, with vertical bed but with two impression cylinders, and arranged to print two sheets at once. It was hand fed, of course, and not automatic. Only one press was built, and we can guess why the work ended there, since facilities for making accurate machinery just did not exist. Kinsley must have been greatly handicapped without suitable inking rollers. The composition roller did not reach this country until almost 25 years later. Benjamin Dearborn, John Sawin, Thomas Wait, Benjamin Metcalf, W. Elliot, Zach Mills, D. Pearson, and probably a number of others, during the following quarter century made or patented improved presses. All showed considerable ingenuity, but most of them were ahead of their times. The first machine press to be regularly made in this country was the invention of Daniel Treadwell, a young Boston mechanic. Treadwell was not a printer, and therefore not bound by tradition. He had studied mechanical movements and their possible application to ease the labor involved in certain trades. The old wooden press, he decided, was wasteful of power and slow in operation. In 1818 he built, but did not patent, an improved press which worked by a foot treadle instead of a hand lever. It involved a very ingenious mechanism, which undoubtedly would have saved labor, but its appearance was decidedly against it. Today, it would have been called a Rube Goldberg. It took up the space of three ordinary presses and involved a number of long levers, braces, bearings, and other parts. Treadwell demonstrated the press to friends and a few printers, who seemed sufficiently interested to warrant his going ahead with the manufacture of the machine. However, instead of attempting to push it further in this country, the inventor decided that England offered a larger field for the promotion of his press, and accordingly he set out for London in November, 1819. The decision to go to England might have been arrived at owing to the experience of George Clymer, the first American to manufacture an all-iron hand press. Clymer had completed his experiments in 1813 and attempted to market his press. When he did not achieve the success he expected, however, he went to England in 1817, where his press was received very favorably. British printers had become aware of the advantages of the iron press, as the Stanhope, an all-iron press, had appeared there in 1800. Treadwell, after arriving in London, arranged to have one of his presses built by Napier, a well-known English press builder. This took time, however, and it was the late spring of 1820 before he could demonstrate his treadle press to London printers. Although his press received favorable comment, and much interest was shown, the buyers did not appear. Treadwell blamed the lack of sales on the inability of the British printer to change his habits. Possibly one or two additional presses were built and sold, but this was not sufficient encouragement and Treadwell returned to Boston in September, 1820. His English visit, however, had changed his views. While there, he had seen the new steam-driven newspaper presses, just coming into use. Here was something bigger, something far more revolutionary, which the American printers could not do without. Probably on the voyage home, Treadwell planned his power press. The English steam-driven presses were of the cylinder type, very much like the press now called the flat bed cylinder. The platen or impression cylinder was mounted on a fixed horizontal axis and the bed carrying the type form moved back and forth under the cylinder. The inking was accomplished automatically by rollers covered with roller composition, which had been discovered or invented about the time of the first successful use of the press in 1814. At the time of Treadwell's visit, the power presses were used almost exclusively for newspaper work, where speed was of primary importance. Surprisingly, Treadwell did not follow the English scheme involving the use of the cylinder. There are no records extant which explain why he adopted an entirely different plan for his press, but enough has been left us so that we may piece out an explanation. The press which he designed and built was based on the old principle of the flat platen pressing down on the type form below it. It was a glorified hand press, with a lot of mechanism added to move the bed in and out from under the platen—to press down the platen automatically at the proper time—and to ink the form. It was described as a mass of levers, cranks, straps, cog wheels, and shafting. Fortunately, we have a diagram which explains the working. (All sketches reproduced here are by the author.) Undoubtedly, Treadwell realized that a cylinder press, following the English style, could not be built in this country. The machine shops were limited to a few lathes and drill presses, and even these were of small size and not too accurate. In making his first power press, Treadwell reported that there was not a lathe in Boston large enough to face the underside of the platen. It was necessary, therefore, to follow the form of construction of the old wooden press and to use a slab of stone for the bed, and a platen made of wood. This must have limited the size and capacity of the press. Later, iron was used for these important parts. Treadwell's friend and neighbor, Phineas Dow, deserves considerable credit for the development of the press. Dow had a machine shop in Boston, and had the reputation of making excellent fire engines and other machines of the period. The first power press was completed, with some difficulties, in 1821. Since a steam engine was not available, a horse was used as motive power. A large vertical shaft, which drove the press, extended down through the pressroom floor, to a basement below. A horizontal lever extended out from the lower end of the shaft and to this the horse was hitched, thus limiting the travel of the beast to a circular path. The first press was without a flywheel. At the moment just before the impression was made, considerable extra power was required to keep the entire mechanism in motion. At this particular point in the cycle, the horse was always at one place in his path, and he came to know just when this extra power was required. If unattended, he took the course of least resistance, and stopped. It was soon found necessary to provide a boy with a stick, who was stationed at the proper point to keep the motive power going. In addition to the boy, an experienced pressman and a woman feeder were required, making a total of three hands employed at the press. The speed was 500 to 600 sheets per hour, which was somewhat faster than twice the speed of the hand press. The latter, however, required both the puller (feeder) and the beater (inker) to be skilled workmen. Later, and more improved models, were made as double presses; that is, they consisted of two presses set back to back, and driven by one common shaft. The total labor bill was somewhat reduced by this arrangement. As was the case with his treadle press, Treadwell found printers only lukewarm in their interest. Not finding a buyer, he determined to become a printer himself. With the backing of two Boston men, he set up a complete establishment for book printing. A second press was added in 1822, and contracts were made with Boston publishers for the printing of a number of books. After having been in successful operation for about a year, the printing office was sold to a Boston printer, who, later, purchased two more presses. A total of four presses were purchased by another Boston office, which a short time later burned to the ground with total destruction of all equipment. It was thought, although not proved, that the fire had been started by printers who feared the machine would ultimately take away their livelihood. Daniel Fanshaw was probably Treadwell's best customer. He conducted one of the largest offices in New York, since he handled the printing for the American Bible Society. At one time, twenty Treadwell presses were operating in Fanshaw's office. Isaac Ashmead of Philadelphia had at least eight Treadwell presses—all double machines—and there were similar presses in Baltimore and Washington. Probably as many as fifty Treadwell presses were built up to 1830. Eventually they were all operated by steam power. Apparently, after the business was well started, Treadwell handled only the sale of the rights to purchase or make the press, and his friend Dow contracted for the actual manufacture. There is some evidence to indicate that not all the presses were made in Boston. A few may have been made in southern cities. Although the first press was put in operation in 1821, a patent was not obtained until 1826. By delaying the issue of the patent, Treadwell hoped to extend its life and hence earn protection for as many years as possible. As early as 1825, Treadwell became interested in other ventures. He developed a number of other machines, and in 1829 disposed of his interest in the power press. Evidently, no improvements were made in the press; as a consequence, the field became wide open for other inventors. In 1830, the R. Hoe &amp; Co. advertisement indicated they were makers of the Treadwell press, but their later advertisements omitted mention of the press. In 1835, Treadwell became a professor at Harvard, where he remained for many years. He died in 1872, at the age of 81 years. By modern standards, the Treadwell presses were crude machines, the main framework consisting of heavy wooden timbers. They were not efficient in their use of power. For each impression the entire bed carrying the type form had to be moved out from under the platen, inked, and then returned to its place. At first, the leather straps, which performed this office, jerked the bed back and forth without a gradual application of power. Later, cam wheels were employed to make the motion smoother, and to ease the shock on the frame. Treadwell employed a revolving disk as the distributing table for the inking rollers. This is of interest, as its use seems to have been forgotten until some twenty-five years later, when George P. Gordon suddenly re-discovered the idea and found it admirably suited for his later well-known job press. The Treadwell press could handle a sheet about 18 inches by 23 inches. This sheet was too small for the requirements of the next decade, but this drawback was only one of the reasons for the later unpopularity of the press. Jonas Booth, of New York, the next builder of power presses, followed soon after Treadwell. His first press was built in 1822, and, in principle, was much like Treadwell's, with the exception that it was a "double feeder." One type form only, was used, and there was a frisket frame at each end to carry the paper under the platen. The paper was placed on the exposed frisket at one end of the press, while the other frisket was under the platen, receiving the impression. Since the bed, containing the type form, moved out from under the platen to be inked, it was reported that the wooden frame was not strong enough to resist the continued stopping and starting of the heavily loaded bed. Booth did not obtain a patent until 1829, when the names of Jonas Booth, Sr., as well as his five sons, appear on the patent papers. His last presses were probably an improvement on his early ventures. The bed was stationary, which was a step in the right direction. Since Booth seems to disappear from the history of printing presses soon after this time, we may infer that the competition forced him out of business. In all, Booth's business was confined to New York or its vicinity, and it does not appear that he made many presses. Both Isaac Adams and Otis Tufts, at one time or another, assisted in making Treadwell presses in Phineas Dow's machine shop in Boston. Tufts later established his own shop and made presses himself. Part of Isaac Adams's work was to help set up new presses and make them work properly: he was what is now known as a "trouble shooter." He saw the disadvantages of the Treadwell press and thought about correcting them. His brother Seth was a machinist in Boston, and it was in Seth's shop that Isaac worked out his ideas for a better press. After obtaining a patent in 1830, he put his press on the market. It was a double ended press, with feeders laying on the sheets at both ends. There was but one form and one platen, but the form was stationary so that the press did not have to withstand the shock of the moving bed. Wood was used for the construction of the main frames. Although in appearance it was not a great improvement on Treadwell's or Booth's presses, it was faster and proved its superiority to the older styles. Adams guaranteed a speed of 1000 sheets per hour, but two feeders were required at the press. The original patent model for this press is now on exhibition at the Smithsonian. Shortly after, Tufts produced a somewhat similar press, but of heavier construction and better finish. A few years later he improved it considerably by discarding the wooden frames and using iron throughout, at the same time shortening the length by placing both frisket frames at the same end of the press. One frisket was placed under the other, so that when one was moving in, under the platen, the other was moving out. Two hands, however, were required for the feeding—one man to take off the sheet and the other to place the unprinted sheet in position. Tufts's patent on this press was obtained in 1834. Printers who saw the press in action were most enthusiastic in their praise, as the machine was excellently constructed and much smoother in operation than its clumsy forerunners. Tufts's success was short-lived, however. A year or two later, the Adams brothers brought forth their final attempt—a press which was to hold its popularity for the next fifty years, and which was destined to handle all the best book and magazine work for many decades. The patent granted to Isaac Adams was dated March 2, 1836. The improved press required only one person to feed the sheets. The delivery was automatic. Adams had worked out a device for successfully removing the sheets from the type form and frisket by means of a blower, and a device known later as a fly. This consisted of a number of long wooden fingers placed parallel, like a fork with many prongs, which flapped the printed sheet from the frisket frame over on to the delivery table. Although the speed by later standards was slow, from 600 to 900 sheets per hour, the press required a minimum of attention and did perfect work. This press proved that for runs of any length, the power press was definitely more economical than the iron hand press. Harper Brothers, who used hand presses until 1837, were forced to adopt the Adams press. Theirs was probably the last large establishment to change over. In America, the development of the power press had followed along different lines from those in England. Over there, the first power press employed a cylinder for the impression; whereas, here, the early presses were all of the platen type, involving a flat impression between two plane surfaces. The cylinder press was faster and required less power, but unless the machine work was most carefully done, the quality of its output was inferior. Probably, England was ahead of this country in the early days of the last century, in its ability to produce larger and better machine tools. The cylinders of their presses had to be very accurately made and geared perfectly to the moving bed, or a slurred impression would result. Treadwell, early, had undoubtedly realized that the facilities to make a satisfactory cylinder press could not be found in America. R. Hoe &amp; Co., of New York, who had been making iron hand presses and other equipment for printers, became interested in the cylinder press in the late twenties. The concern sent a man to England to obtain as much information as possible, with the result that in 1832 they offered to build cylinder presses for printers in America. The type they chose to make was similar to the press made by Napier in England, although the Hoe Company did not apply the Napier name to their press. However, for a number of years, all cylinder presses made in this country were called Napiers. Hoe, and later other concerns, built a great many cylinder presses, but before 1860 their use was confined to newspapers and the cheaper kinds of printing. The cylinder had the bad habit of wearing down the type rapidly, particularly the first few lines at the bottom of the page, where the cylinder first hit the form in its rapid movement. The register was not good, and it was impossible to "back up" the work properly; that is, the impression on the reverse side of a sheet would not fall exactly even with the impression on the front. In the early seventies, improved and better-made cylinder presses appeared, and it was found possible to do a better grade of work on these presses. Moreover, they grew in size, whereas, the Adams had reached its maximum practical limit of platen area. Slowly, the cylinder press became more commonly used for the better grade of work. The Hoe Company, which had assumed the leadership in this country in the manufacture of large presses for fast newspaper printing, had for some time attempted to make a press which would compete in quality of work with the Adams. In the forties, a few large platen presses were built which infringed certain features of the Adams patents. A long drawn out controversy ensued, which resulted in the Hoe people buying out the Adams business in 1859. Isaac retired to his boyhood home in Sandwich, Mass., with a considerable fortune, where he died in 1883. His brother Seth had died in 1873. The Hoe Company continued the manufacture of the Adams press until the late eighties, but a smaller number was made each year. Compared to the more modern cylinders, the press was too slow, but a few were still in operation in New York City in the early years of this century. It has been estimated that over one thousand of the improved Adams presses were made. For almost fifty years these presses handled the bulk of the better printing in this country. The smaller shops of a hundred years ago, doing book and newspaper work, would have one Adams press. When such a press was used for newspaper work, it left its distinguishing mark on the make-up of the page. In order to lift the sheet from the form after printing, the frisket frame contained one or more longitudinal wires, which supported the center of the sheet. As these wires came right down on the form during the printing operation, it was necessary to provide a groove or channel along one side of a column rule, about one-eighth to three-sixteenths inch wide, and to cut the same opening through the head rules and heading. Six-column papers had one supporting wire and eight-column papers had two. If one should ever come across a small-town newspaper of the middle of the nineteenth century, with a narrow white strip right down the middle, it was printed on an Adams.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">THE LAYING OF A GHOST? Observations on the 1483 Ratdolt Edition of the Fasciculus Temporum Curt F. Bühler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EVER since the middle of the eighteenth century, a 1483 edition of the Fasciculus temporum from the press of Erhard Ratdolt has appeared in the annals of Venetian printing history. We have it on the excellent authority of Georg Wolfgang Panzer, 1 who quotes Georg Wilhelm Zapf's notation 2 that this edition was listed in the Bibliotheca historicocritica librorum opusculorumque rariorum (Nürnberg, 1736) by Georg Jacob Schwindel, 3 writing under the pseudonym of Theophilus Sincerus. If Schwindel actually saw the book, he appears to have been the first and last person who ever examined such an edition. There is, however, an exceedingly persuasive suggestion that, in this case, Schwindel (either consciously or otherwise) was simply living up to his name. The 1483 edition by Ratdolt was nevertheless duly noted by Hain, Pollard, Essling, Diehl and the British Museum's incunabula catalogue; 4 furthermore it is listed with reservation by Redgrave and Sander. 5 Yet it is curious beyond measure that no copy of this edition has ever been located! Through the kind offices of Dr. Elisabeth von Kathen, I have recently been informed that not even the manuscript of the unprinted sections of the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke records the existence of a single example of Ratdolt's 1483 Fasciculus temporum . If this Schwindel notation were the only evidence for such a production, one would quite properly set down this edition as an error (perhaps a misreading by the cataloguer of the roman date "M.cccc.lxxxiiij" of a known Ratdolt printing). But, as the BMC duly points out, 6 there is a statement made by Ratdolt himself which postulates an edition no copy of which has survived to our day. At present there are four extant editions credited to Ratdolt: those of 24 November 1480 (Hain 6926), 21 December 1481 (Hain 6928), 28 May 1484 (Hain 6934) and 8 September 1485 (Hain 6935). In the 1484 edition (PML 334, folio 1 v ), 7 Erhard Ratdolt remarks, in his dedicatory letter to Niccolò Mocenigo "il grande", as follows: 8 In these circumstances, since I have undertaken to print with greater care and labor the Fasciculus temporum , which thrice before this I alone have printed in these parts of Italy having set figures and images in their due order, I have decided to dedicate this work and my labors to you. In the following year, Ratdolt speaks of the 1485 edition as having been preceded by four earlier printings. 9 Since this statement was made by the printer himself, one is certainly required to believe that Ratdolt printed three editions before that of 1484, though only his editions of 1480 and 1481 are evidenced by actual copies. While this appears to point directly to a 1483 printing, it is indeed amazing that, in the past 215 years, no one has seen an example of such a production. The other Ratdolt editions may, without exaggeration, be called quite common works, and some edition by this printer is almost certainly to be found in even the most modest collection of fifteenth-century books. Such large European libraries as those in Berlin, Florence, London, Madrid, Munich, Oxford and Venice (among others) possess all four Ratdolt printings. For North America alone, Miss Margaret B. Stillwell 10 lists no fewer than sixteen copies each for the 1480 and 1484 editions, fifteen of that of 1485, and twenty-one for the 1481 production. And yet no one can find a copy of the 1483 Ratdolt edition anywhere in the wide world! Is there another explanation for Ratdolt's very explicit statements? In order to present a possible (and plausible) solution for these some-what contradictory pieces of evidence, it will be necessary to review briefly some biographical details which may not be too familiar to the reader. 11 Erhard Ratdolt of Augsburg seems to have arrived in Venice about the year 1476, and shortly afterwards formed a partnership with Bernhard "Maler" (a native of the same Swabian city) and Peter Löslein of Langenzenn (near Fürth in Bavaria). Ratdolt was apparently in charge of the press, while the painter Bernhard may have been the head of the firm and its art director; 12 Löslein was certainly the "corrector et socius." 13 This press had a successful career until 1478 when Löslein dropped out and shortly thereafter Maler and Ratdolt dissolved their partnership. Following the dissolution of the firm, Ratdolt's name disappears from our sight until 1 April 1480, on which day he completed and signed (by himself) a Breviarium Benedictinum congregationis S. Iustinae (GW 5181). Shortly after the disappearance of the house of Maler, Ratdolt, and Löslein in 1478, a new press made its appearance in Venice under the sponsorship of yet another German, Georg Walch. 14 This press employed a gothic type very similar to one subsequently found in the hands of Ratdolt (his type 4:76G). The woodcut capitals used by Walch were not unlikely the identical ones employed by Ratdolt before 1479 and after the reopening of his own press. In all Walch printed but four books known to us, the last of which (the Rationale divinorum officiorum by Guillelmus Duranti—GW 9124) is dated 18 May 1482. But it is surely worthy of note that the very first of these four productions is a Fasciculus temporum , dated 1479, which, the colophon assures us, was "printed with the extraordinary diligence and expense of Georg Walch, a German." 15 This book, among the earliest of Venetian illustrated works, 16 is one which must have required considerable technical skill. 17 Is it reasonable to suppose that Walch, as his very first venture, could turn out such a work without the assistance of outside and experienced help? Or could we be justified in assuming that Ratdolt had a hand in this undertaking, as the practical printer; that his were the labors which actually produced the 1479 Fasciculus temporum while Walch's contribution was limited to supplying the text and the very necessary capital? This Fasciculus temporum with its numerous technical difficulties was obviously produced by a professional and can hardly have been the trial effort of a novice. 18 Moreover, it was printed with equipment certainly forming part of Ratdolt's stock-in-trade and was taken in hand just about the time that Ratdolt disappears from our view. To this investigator anyway, it seems an altogether likely solution for the conflicting evidence cited above to assume that Ratdolt was employed by Walch to print the Fasciculus temporum for him, though he received no credit for his share in the work in the colophon of the 1479 edition. Perhaps this irked Ratdolt, though so long as Walch was still in Venice, Ratdolt made no mention of his part in the production of this first Italian printing and no statement to that effect is found in Ratdolt's 1480 and 1481 editions. But Walch probably left Venice for his homeland some time after May 1482—and in his first printing of the Fasciculus temporum subsequent thereto (28 May 1484), Ratdolt made the claim set forth above. Until a copy of the 1483 printing can actually be produced, it is my belief that one may treat this edition as a "ghost." The five editions printed by Ratdolt can be identified as the four issued on his own initiative, plus the 1479 printing for which Walch allowed him no credit. The theory set forth here would completely set at rest the problems discussed in this study and explain the known facts relative to the editions now credited to Erhard Ratdolt. It does not seem essential, to the present writer anyway, to postulate the existence of a 1483 Venetian Fasciculus temporum ; this can be deferred until such a time as a copy may be presented for the inspection of the bibliographical world.</field>

The BMC (V:xxii) has this interesting comment: "Georgius Walch, a German whose name points to Italian ancestry, appears to have been connected in some way with Ratdolt, but the precise relation is obscure. His first recorded book, Rolewinck, Fasciculus temporum, belongs to 1479, when Ratdolt had severed his connexion with Maler and Löslein but had not yet resumed printing on his own account. Its type closely resembles one which Ratdolt employed in the following year for an edition of the same work evidently modelled on that of Walch, while its woodcut capitals are even more like those used by Ratdolt both before and after this date and may possibly form part of the same sets." 15 The colophon (PML 324, f. 72) reads: "imp re ssa Venetijs singulari industria atq ue impensa Georij Walch almani. an no d om ini 1479.

Stillwell, "The Fasciculus Temporum: A Genealogical Survey of Editions before 1480," Bibliographical Essays; A Tribute to Wilberforce Eames (1924), pp. 409-440. 18 Neither Haebler nor BMC knows anything of Walch's career prior to his appearance in Venice with the printing of the Fasciculus temporum . Haebler (p. 114) surmises that he is the same person as the Jorg Walich listed as a citizen of Vienna in 1493, where he is described as a "Buchführer."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Shakespearian Dated Watermarks Allan H. Stevenson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ON a perfect morning in July, when I might have been bowling on the greens at Arroyo Seco, I made a minor Shakespearian discovery. In the Huntington Library reading room I was reëxamining the Jaggard-Pavier quartos of 1619. As all the world knows, Sir Walter Greg brilliantly proved, in 1908, that these quartos, variously dated 1600, 1608, and 1619, had all been printed in the latter year; and the most persuasive part of his evidence lay in the complex mixture of watermarks distributed through them. 1 Yet history records that conservative-minded gentlemen like Sir Sidney Lee and Alfred H. Huth were not readily persuaded. 2 On this day forty-two years after, 3 I was searching the Huntington set of 1619 quartos for evidence of twin watermarks, and finding what I sought: most of the marks pictured by Greg were turning out to be pairs themselves or members of pairs. 4 I had also found several new marks to add to his list of twenty-seven. Thus, while leafing through the Church copy of Sir John Oldcastle (dated "1600"), I was not much surprised to note a new pot in sheet F. It was not a prepossessing fellow, for it looked more like a pot of 1600 than of 1619, having a simple form, apparently little superstructure, and a malformed base. But in a narrow band across the throat was an inscription. I could make out something like a 6, a sort of lopsided u, and what might be a tall, thinnish X. Puzzled, I moved on, hoping for another view of this new thing. But I had none. Half an hour later—such is the timing of coincidence—I stopped similarly in my sidelong perusal of the Church copy of Henry V (dated "1608")—again at sheet F. Here was another pot not in Greg's gallery. This one looked more like a Norman pot of about 1620. It had a candle-like top above a number of lobes, a fleur-de-lis on its chest, the initials PD on its bowl, and below them certainly—a date. The figures 1 and 6 were clear enough. Then came a space where only a 1 could go, and of which only a stub remained. And beyond that a figure that might be a 7 or 9, the top being slightly obscured by type. The base was also obscured, but that hardly mattered. The inscription on the bowl apparently had once read PD/1617 or 1619. This pot appeared in no other sheet of Henry V. Only at F1.4, with the date on F4. Breathless, I reopened the Oldcastle , at sheet F. The inscription on the pot throat might also be a date. Indeed, it looked much like one. 1608. The 1 was a heavy mark just inside the left line of the neck. The 6 was a 6, with a curved top. The u-like form was the lower part of an o. The X was an 8 with the ends squared by the lines of the band. As the paper was thickish and the imprint of the wire-design none too sharp, I regarded it doubtfully; yet there seemed to be no other way to read what was on the band. It was no attempt at ornament; and from the reverse side it made no sense. The top of this pot (with the date) was in F4, and the base and part of the bowl in F1. And on the bowl parts of two letters were visible, deep in the quarto crack. They might be MO or MJ—or BM or LM reversed. 5 But they merely added to the mystery of this curious pot. Briquet when summoned brought forward several analogies of dated pots, but none with a dated band high on the throat. 6 Churchill, on the other hand, offered in his first pot one remarkably similar to the PD pot. 7 Here were the same candle-like shoot above clustered lobes, a similar fleur-de-lis throat, a similar PD on the bowl, and below it 16, apparently a year date with both final digits missing. Whether this is the same pot with the 7 or 9 lost, or its twin, or a mark from a related set of moulds I do not know: such are the vagaries of tracings; and Churchill does not show the position of the chains. His note merely indicates that he found it in a sheet (of manuscript?) which he dates 1618. 8 This fact may be one reason for preferring the reading 1617 on the Henry V pot, though at first I preferred 1619. The sketches I made show a figure with an open top and a curved back. Let us call it a 7. If it seems strange to the reader that one or two figures should drop out of a watermark, he should note that they must have been formed of tiny pieces of wire and sewed at either end to the band wires across the belly of the pot. The constant wear on moulds in use and the brushing at the end of the day tended to distort the wireforms and even to break off bits of wire. In this instance it looks very much as if the 1 had come unsewn at the top and subsequently broken off near the base; and the final digit may have been distorted into ambiguity. Just two weeks later, in examining the plates in Raleigh's History of the World (Jaggard, 1621), crown folio, I noted a pair of shields, quarterly a fess R G D and three lions (style of Heawood 576), with the year 1610 in the base point of one shield and 16:0 in its twin. In this instance too the second figure 1 has dropped out , leaving sewing-marks to show where it had been. 9 No longer could I doubt that the gods provide coincidences by way of empiric proof. Both dated Shakespeare pots are situated mainly between chains. The 1608 pot fits within a chain-space of 23-24 mm. Its style is that of Heawood 3548-54. Its crest has five points with a trefoil on the center one and single or double circlets on the others. The neckband is 6 mm. high and the date 9 mm. wide. There is not enough of the bowl to measure; but the misshapen base measures 6[18]0 reading up. The handle is in normal position, at the left. The 1617 pot is centered at top 9.5:9.5 between 19 mm. chains. The leafed shoot above (if that's what it is) is unlike that in Greg 17 or Heawood 3545, in that it has sprouts above and leaves farther down. The five lobes that show resemble those in Greg 6 or Heawood 3565. The handle is to the right, outside the chain. The bowl with the precious date measures 1[18:1] up. The base is hard to make out. The accompanying illustrations of these two pots are mere rough sketches. 10 Friends at the Huntington who viewed these pots generally conceded the 1617 date: there could be no doubt of it, except for the ambiguity of the 7 or 9. When shown the 1608 pot Dr. James McManaway shook his head slightly in puzzlement; while others said it looked more like a date than anything else. Obviously a further example of this tantalizing pot had to be found, if possible. And the PD pot was not yet complete, for its neck was lost in the quarto fold. None of the set of nine Pavier quartos at the Huntington yielded further instances of these pots; and the Library had disposed of its so-called duplicate of Henry V. So I turned to the Clark Memorial Library in Los Angeles. Its copies of Oldcastle and Henry V had only the pots and shields illustrated by Greg. A month later in Austin I examined the Oldcastle of 1619 in the Wren Collection: it had no dated pots. In September in New York I saw the Lenox, Morgan, and Rosenbach copies of Oldcastle and the Morgan copy of Henry V ; and later in Chicago the Newberry Henry V ; but still I found no pots with dates. 11 Recently Dr. Giles Dawson has kindly checked the Folger Shakespeare Library copies—an undertaking, for the Folger has seven copies of each! Yet his patience has produced no pots of 1608 or 1617, no jugs that resemble my sketches. Thus the conviction grows that these are "intrusive" watermarks. The 1608 mark appears just once in seventeen copies examined by Greg, Dawson, and myself; and the PD/1617 mark once in fifteen. According to the Pollard-Greg theory the 1619 quartos were printed on a job-lot of miscellaneous papers supplied by a London paper merchant. 12 I have suggested that such mixtures may have resulted normally from the manufacture of paper by a cluster of papermills in Normandy (or elsewhere) and its periodic collection by a paper factor. 13 Yet neither hypothesis, nor both taken together (which may be the better view), quite explains these rare dated pots. They imply the inclusion of an odd quire or so in the paper laid out for an edition-sheet. Either the paper merchant has thrown in the remnant of a ream, or Jaggard has swept out his stockroom. In laying out paper for the press, the outside or "cording" quires were commonly put aside and replaced by good inside quires from other reams—or by quires culled from cording quires. 14 Further, extra quires were needed for filling out short quires, for proofs, and for replacement of "naughty" sheets. And sometimes for copies allowed in part-payment of the printer's work. Occasionally, no doubt, the warehouse keeper recovered a quire or two from some odd corner or pile of waste—and thus filled out the count for the press. If the 1608 date can be accepted, it looks as if we have an instance of such an odd quire turning up in Jaggard's stockroom (or his paper merchant's) ten years after it was sold out of France. This interval is in accord with delayed uses noted by Briquet. 15 If the other date is 1617, there has been a proper interval after manufacture; and it may be that Jaggard had used some reams of this paper in recent books. If the date is 1619, the year of issue, the small amount used is less likely to have come from a broken ream; but it might indicate a mixture of paper from more than one vat in the papermill—though then we should find other PD marks among the Jaggard-Pavier quartos. A 1619 date would have interesting implications for the time of printing. 16 A slow search among pot folios and quartos of 1608-10 and 1617-20, particularly among Jaggard's books, may ultimately answer the questions posed by these dated Shakesperian watermarks. The papermaker PD may be represented by some of the Pot PD watermarks in Briquet's great work and Edward Heawood's recently published collection of Watermarks , 17 but his identity is unknown. He might belong to the Debon or the Durand family of papermakers, or some other. The significance of this small Shakespearian discovery is not what it would have been forty or so years ago. At that time the ways of the New Bibliography proved difficult for men of the old school; and the arguments of A. W. Pollard and W. W. Greg from printers' and papermakers' ornaments, though they look good now, provoked an amiable controversy of two years' duration—which was smothered in 1910 by William J. Neidig's evidence from photographic measurement of title pages. 18 If the New Bibliography had discovered in the Capell or Huth copies (say) what I have now happened on in the Church copies of Oldcastle and Henry V , it would have been saved some of the joys of creative bibliography, though it might have convinced with one thwack schoolmasters in the upper forms. For anyone at all can see that a Sir John Oldcastle dated 1600 on its title page but apparently containing a 1608 watermark may not have been printed in 1600; and that a Henry V dated 1608 but certainly watermarked 1617 (or 1619) was definitely not published before the latter year. Indeed, so elementary a demonstration may be useful even today, for some boys have not yet been promoted to the upper forms. On the other hand, inasmuch as a paper war was waged and in effect won forty years ago, I, on a marvelous July day in 1950, might well have gone bowling on the smooth Arroyo Seco greens. The shade of Shakespeare might have been better pleased, for bowls was his favorite game. 19</field>

It is worth note that the PD pot in the Huntington Henry V is preceded by three unwatermarked sheets and followed by one. Unquestionably somebody was scraping bottom. 12 Greg, "On Certain False Dates," pp. 395-396. 13 "Watermarks Are Twins," pp. 59-60. 14 It may be assumed that at this time papermakers included cording quires and printers treated them much as Moxon describes later in the century. See Joseph Moxon, Mechanick Exercises , ed. T. L. De Vinne (1896), II, 353-356. Bibliographers have not usually allowed for cording quires in their reckoning of reams. For the term see E. J.

(Amsterdam, 1951). 15 Briquet, I, xix-xxiii; summarized by Greg, "On Certain False Dates," pp. 121-122. 16 On 3 May 1619 the Lord Chamberlain wrote the Stationers' Company asking that no King's plays be printed "without some of their consents." [E. K. Chambers, William Shakespeare (1930), I, 136.] And on 8 July Lawrence Hayes entered on the Stationers' Register as his copy The Merchant of Venice , formerly the property of his father but among those reprinted by Jaggard. As W. W. Greg says, "It seems likely that this entry was occasioned by Jaggard's piracy, of which it therefore suggests the approximate date." [ A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration , I (1939), 279.] Paper dated 1619 would have had to be made rather early in the year (in France) to be available by May or even July; and time has to be allowed for wear on the mould and the loss of the figure 1. 17 B 12789-92 have the initials PD; B 12793 has PD/B and B 12794 P/DB.

      <field name="heading_text">A Supplement to the Bibliography of 'Shakespeare Idolatry' Margaret Lee Wiley</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN The Genesis of Shakespeare Idolatry , 1766-1799 , Professor R. W. Babcock 1 brought together an impressive bibliography of late eighteenth-century Shakespearean criticism. The list, as it stands after twenty years, is so comprehensive that supplements to it are worthy of attention when they come to light. The purpose of this article is to name two volumes which supplement the following sections of Professor Babcock's study: (1) "Primary Texts," 1770-1774, pages 254-255; (2) "Shakespeare, Original Genius," pages 123-126; and (3) "The Application of Theories of Association to Various Aspects of Shakespeare," pages 176-182. The first volume to which I call attention was published by William Duff in 1770: Critical Observations | on the | Writings | of the most celebrated | Original Geniuses in Poetry . | Being a Sequel | to the | Essay on Original Genius . [London: Printed for T. Becket and P. A. DeHondt, in the Strand]. 2 Section III of this work is a criticism and an appreciation of Shakespeare's original genius in the invention of incident, character, and imagery, and in the expression of the sublime, the pathetic, the wild and picturesque, and the supernatural. In addition to the seventy-page discussion in Section III, other comments upon Shakespeare appear in the book (pp. 95, 120, 197, and 365). The comprehensiveness of Duff's treatment of Shakespeare makes this volume an essential supplement to Professor Babcock's bibliography. Added significance of the supplement derives from the fact that Critical Observations was not mentioned by Mr. Paul Kaufman in "Heralds of Original Genius"; 3 nor did Professor R. S. Crane name the work when he reviewed Mr. Kaufman's study in "English Literature of the Restoration and Eighteenth Century: A Current Bibliography" ( PQ , VI [1927], 168-169). The second volume to which I call attention is a critical application of the laws of association to Shakespeare's plays. According to Professor Babcock, "The psychological process of association was perhaps first applied definitely to interpret Shakespeare in this period by William Richardson in 1774." 4 Without disputing the priority of William Richardson, I call attention to another work published in that year, 1774, which was not mentioned by Professor Babcock and not listed in his bibliography, but which contains a well-developed criticism of Shakespeare's plays according to the principles of association: " An | Essay | on | Genius | By | Alexander Gerard, D. D. | Professor of Divinity in King's College. | Aberdeen." [London: Printed for W. Strahan; T. Cadell in the Strand; and W. Creech at Edinburgh]. Although Gerard had read papers on genius and on the association of ideas before the Aberdeen Philosophical Society between 1758 and 1771 and had, according to his Advertisement, made some progress toward An Essay on Genius as early as 1758, Richardson's philosophical analysis reached the public first, being reviewed in May, 1774, whereas Gerard's was noticed several months later. 5 The evidence of the periodicals thus discredits Robert Chambers' belief that Richardson was not published until 1775, 6 a date that would have given Gerard priority in the publication of a philosophical analysis of Shakespeare's plays in terms of the laws of association. In An Essay on Genius the detailed study of Shakespeare was the climax to Gerard's study of genius, and all except one of his significant illustrations came from Shakespeare. How much earlier than 1774 Gerard had in fact applied the laws of association to Shakespeare's work cannot be precisely determined, for much of his work between 1758 and 1771 had been for oral presentation.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Second Quarto of A King and No King , 1625 Berta Sturman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE copy for A King and No King was entered in the Stationers' Register to Edward Blount on 7 August, 1618. There is no record of a transfer of the copy to Thomas Walkley, who published the first quarto in 1619. The dedicatory epistle addressed to Sir Henry Nevill which appears only in the first quarto seems to indicate that the quarto had been printed from a manuscript which the publisher had secured from Nevill. 1 It is therefore possible that the first quarto was printed from a private transcript without the permission of the King's Company. The statement on the title-page of the second edition of 1625 "And now the second time Printed, according to the true Copie" may indicate that the first quarto was not from copy which had been furnished by the company. The second quarto, containing many prompt notes, seems to have been printed from the official book which the actors used in the playhouse. There are not only many added stage directions in this edition but also many small deletions and minor alterations in the text. In spite of the fact that these circumstances would seem to indicate two different manuscripts used as copy for the two quartos, there are a number of curious similarities in the printing of the two editions. These similarities seem to suggest that the second quarto was printed from a marked copy of the first. The differences between the two texts suggest, furthermore, that the copy for the second quarto was the official playhouse copy with the prompter's notes. The title-page of the first quarto reads: "A King and no King. Acted at the Globe , by his Maiesties Seruants. Written by Francis Beamount, and Iohn Flecher." The second quarto substitutes "Blacke-Fryars" for "Globe," and adds the statement about the copy. The arrangement of the title-pages is quite different, but the curious spelling of the authors' names is repeated in both quartos. The first quarto type-page measures 91 mm. from margin to margin. The Q2 page is narrower, measuring 88 mm. from margin to margin. The type size is the same in both quartos. The additional stage directions in the second quarto make it impossible to print that text within fewer pages than the number occupied by the text of the earlier edition. Although the number of lines per page is the same, the second quarto, therefore, could not be a page for page reprint. Moreover, while the size of type is the same, the lines of the second quarto are 3 mm. shorter, thus making a line for line reprint difficult. Yet in spite of this difference in space, the line endings of the prose passages show a startling correspondence. 2 The passage at line 66, Act V, scene i, has the line endings: laming of, for you, have a leg, like a, of my con-, like a, verie person, leave you, are much, in both quartos. Since the lines of the second quarto are a trifle shorter, however, one would expect the shorter words like of, you, leg, a, to be carried over to the beginning of the succeeding line, particularly as the last line of the paragraph is so very short that the compositor could not have lost a line of space by so doing. Such correspondences, then, can hardly be accidental. In some of these prose speeches, the passage at line 96, Act III, scene iii, and that at line 31, Act V, scene ii, for example, the compositor of the second quarto, because of some variation in spelling, found himself with extra space at his disposal. Instead of filling up the line as usual, he sometimes spaced out the words so that the line arrangement of the first quarto is preserved. At the beginning of the second scene of Act III, Bessus has a long prose soliloquy. For the first twenty-five lines of this speech the second quarto faithfully follows the line arrangement of the first. Then at line 26 a word is lost, and by line 35 the second quarto is three words behind the first. In the following line the words "to account" have been dropped out, apparently by accident, restoring the line for line correspondence. Two other passages may link the first two quartos. At the beginning of scene iv, Act V, five lines of Arbaces' speech are omitted in Q2. Instead of printing the half lines marking the beginning and end of the cut in a single line of type, Q2 prints them as separate lines, an awkward arrangement which may refer back to a deletion marked on the printed page of Q1. A second passage seems to contain an error perpetrated by the printer of the first quarto which has been only partially corrected in the second quarto. At line 118, Act I, scene i, the first quarto has: But of her eye Tigranes . Is it the course of The compositor has here omitted the speech head which ought to indicate a change in speakers. It looks as though the manuscript perhaps looked like this: But of her eye. Tigranes . Is it the course of and the compositor attached the speech head to the last line of Arbaces' speech. In the second quarto the missing speech head has been supplied, making the passage read: But of her eye Tigranes . Tigr . Is't the course of Iberia to vse their prisoners thus? A number of errors seem to have been carried over from the first quarto to the second. The word "Souldier" at line 59, Act I, scene i, is singular in the first two quartos; it has been corrected to the plural form in subsequent editions. Line 269 in the same scene, which has been emended to "To talke but idly," is given in Q1 as "to balke but I desire," in Q2 as "to balke but I defie." The misreading "balke" for "talke" thus occurs in all the early quartos. At line 71, Act V, scene iii, Q1 reads "slaue, my key" which Q2 partly corrects to "slaue my toe." Subsequent quartos change the "slaue" of the first two quartos to "hurts." Still another correspondence between the first two quartos should perhaps be noted. At the beginning of the second Act, and at line 45 of the first scene of Act III, the stage directions of the first quarto are sufficiently long that it was necessary to carry the directions into a second line. This second line, in both instances, is not centered. The second quarto copies this unusual arrangement. The first quarto was printed in 88 pages, the text ending on M2 verso. There are 38 lines to a page with many stage directions centered to occupy a separate line of type. The second quarto was printed in 91 pages, the text ending in the middle of M3 recto. Again there are 38 lines to a page, but there are more blank lines setting off stage directions than in the first quarto, so that the line arrangement of the first quarto looks more crowded. In the last two gatherings, however, the arrangement of the second quarto is quite different from that of the first. Beginning with signature L, the number of lines per page is reduced from 38 to 36. From this point onward even brief stage directions are centered to occupy separate lines, and the blank space above stage directions is increased in width. What seems to have occurred is this. The compositor had before him a copy which seemed to contain more material than the first quarto. The first edition, however, had been printed with an initial blank leaf and two final blank leaves, an arrangement which the Elizabethan printer considered undesirable since it required as much labor to print one leaf as four. The compositor of the second quarto, therefore, eliminated the initial blank leaf by beginning his text on A2 instead of on A3. The extra material would doubtless go to fill up the three blank leaves. Throughout most of the work, the arrangement seemed to be succeeding until, at signature L, he was printing material which appeared a page and a half earlier in Q1. At that point, perhaps because a cut of five lines reduced the material yet to be printed, the compositor realized that he would still have an undesirable number of blank leaves at the end. To prevent this, he reduced the number of lines per page and stretched out his copy as far as possible. By this procedure, and with the help of an ornamental tail piece, he gained a leaf and a half, leaving only three blank pages instead of the six of the first quarto. Since misspellings and other errors in the first quarto reappear in the second, it becomes probable that the latter was printed from the former. The similarities in typographical arrangement increase the probability. It is difficult to explain the unexpected divergence of the last two gatherings if we postulate a manuscript copy for Q2, but it becomes easier to account for it if the first copy were used as copy for the second. The conclusion to be drawn would seem to be that Q2 is a reprint of Q1. Q2, however, was printed from the "true copie," to all appearances from the official stage copy. The nature of the differences between the two texts thus becomes significant. Except for one cut of five lines already referred to, the text has not been noticeably altered. No appreciable additions have been made, and differences in readings which do appear are alterations of single words or brief phrases. No change has been made which affects plot or characterization. In short, no textual addition or alteration of sufficient interest to warrant collation of a printed copy of Q1 with a playhouse MS can be found. The additions which have been made to Q1 consist of marginalia which seem to be all of a prompt nature. Nearly every stage direction has been expanded, usually in such a way as to make the direction more explicit. Thus "Enter Arbaces and Tigranes, with attendants" becomes "Enter Arbaces and Tigranes two Kings, &amp;c. The two Gentlemen.", and "Enter Panthæa" becomes "Enter Panthæa and 1 Gent." Musical directions have been added. A few exits which had been unmarked in the first quarto are marked in the second. At least one entrance direction, "Flourish, Enter one running." on D3 v appears only in the second quarto. For the second quarto the exit directions have been made more explicit so that characters' names are frequently added to such directions, and group exits are frequently broken up. One entrance in the first act has been printed twice so that a warning of three lines is given. One very interesting direction in the fourth act has been expanded to indicate setting: "Enter Tigranes in prison." In two places the technical prompter's note "Exeunt cleere" appears in the second quarto. This note also occurs in the prompt manuscript of Heywood's The Captives and in the manuscript prompt notes in the Chicago copy of A Looking Glasse for London and England . 3 In a stage direction in the last act an actor's name occurs: "Enter Seruant, Will. Adkinson." 4 It seems unlikely that a publisher would deem these notes of sufficient general interest to hire someone to collate a copy of the quarto with a theatrical manuscript to secure them. If, however, the publisher had acquired a copy of the quarto which had been used as prompt text, i.e. "the true copie," the prompter's notes would be carried over into the printed page, giving us just such a text as we have in Q2.. The existence of a copy of the first quarto which had been used as the official stage copy would seem to indicate that the King's Men, on some occasions at least, used a printed copy for the official book. One may conjecture, however, that the original manuscript was lost, or destroyed in the Globe fire in 1613, thus necessitating the use of a private transcript as copy for the first quarto. The existence of a copy of Q1 with manuscript playhouse notes which was later used as copy for the second quarto would imply that there was an unrecorded revival of the play, possibly at the Blackfriars, between 1619 and 1625.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Prompt Copy of Dryden's Tyrannic Love Henry Hitch Adams</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE Folger Shakespeare Library has a prompt copy of Dryden's Tyrannic Love 1 which is worth recording because it can throw some light on the theatrical practice and on the production methods of the King's Company, and possibly on the manner in which they revived their plays after the disastrous fire of 1672 had destroyed their stock of scenery, costumes, and, presumably, acting scripts. The prompt copy consists of a normal quarto of the second edition of Tyrannic Love (1672), and it is my assumption that this particular quarto represents the prompt book for the King's Company, which would have had to prepare a new one after the destruction of their entire properties by the fire on January 25, 1671/2. Dryden had revised this second edition by adding thirty-nine lines and reviewing the whole. 2 Unless the 1672 edition were chosen simply because it was most readily available, its use as a prompt copy may imply that an effort was made by someone who knew his business to secure the best text. The Folger quarto has been bound in boards and is generally in good condition. The lower quarter of leaf A4 has been cut away, but the Prologue and the Cast of Characters, which appear on this leaf, are intact. On several pages a few letters, and on one page a few words, of the manuscript notations have been cut away by the binder. Three hands appear in the volume. Hand A, written in ink which is now brown, is a neat, regular hand of the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century. It looks something like the hand of a professional scribe, but the character of the notations, which are more extensive than any others in the volume, reveals him to be an educated man, probably not connected with the theatre. His notations consist of poetic scraps, both in English and in Latin, and a few lines and speeches copied from the text. Hand B, written in a faded brown ink, is immature and sprawling; apparently the writer was using the book as a model from which to practice writing. Hand C, written in ink which is still very black, is an old-fashioned, seventeenth-century hand, clearly belonging to the prompter or stage manager. From the markings in Hand C, the only ones worth recording, we can get a fairly good notion of how Tyrannic Love was produced after 1672. The stage direction of the opening scene is a curious one in the printed text, for it reads " A Camp or Pavillion Royal ," as though Dryden had left the actual setting up to the producers. It is clear that the latter alternative was used, for C's notes specify that "Staires" and a "Greate Dore" shall be used in this scene. At the opening appears the manuscript notation "The Curten drawes &amp; Discovers," 3 followed by the stage direction as printed. The play thus opened to a crowded stage with some representation of a Pavillion Royal. The impending entry of the army at the line, "And this way travels, shews some Army near," is heralded by a "Flourish very short." Albinus' exit at the next line is "to y e Staires," and his reentry is marked "Flourish agen" (p. 4 [338]). A Flourish follows at Charinus' speech, "I am not for a slothful envy born/I'll do't this day, in dire Visions scorn." Another occurs at Porphyrius' entry attended, "Flourish agen at y e Greate Dore" (p. 5 [338]). After the tribute to Porphyrius and the beginning of the complicated love intrigue, the printed stage direction calls for a dead march within. This is amended by the prompter to read "Dead March at Greate Dore," and Albinus' entry, presumably through the "Greate Dore," is marked by "Agen Dead March" (p. 6 [340]). The remainder of the act contains no further entries in Hand C except for the notation "Call y e Musique" at the end of the act. Act II shows no mark of the stage manager's notations except for the word "Musique," written before the printed direction "Exit" at the end of the act. Act III returns to the Pavillion Royal where we have the great door and the stairs, but again the only notation is "Musique" at the end of the act. In Act IV the setting is the Indian Cave. According to C, it is represented by "The bl[ack] Curten," 4 and an attempt is apparently made to bring off some of the mysterious quality by sound effects, as we find the note "Call y e Thund[er]" written in at Placidus' statement, "Remember you oblige an Emperour." Four lines further down appears "After y e Thunder ca[ll] for y e Song" (p. 29 [360]). The song must be one of those used to tempt St. Catharine to the ways of love, as at least one of the three songs is necessary for the plot, but all the songs have been marked out, together with the rest of the Elysium scene. The omissions are marked by vertical lines and by the manuscript note, "The rest is left out." This notation appears opposite the printed line, "Fram'd all of purest Atoms of the Air." The scribbled word "Exeunt" shows that the stage was cleared for some abridged version of the temptation scene. 5 At the end of the cut appears a long entry in Hand C, part of which has fallen victim to the binder's shears, but which can be tentatively reconstructed as "Before Placid [enters shut ???? y e ]/Black &amp; sett up y e State." 6 What has happened here is by no means clear. The omitted scene is one in which St. Catharine is tempted by the infernal spirits and saved from weakening by her guardian angel. Yet it is clear from the call for the song, and from Placidus' line, "How doubtfully these Specters Fate fortell," which C has marked "Enter Placid," that some kind of representation of the temptation scene was presented. It seems likely that it was played against a drop of some color other than black, which then closed down for the remainder of the scene in the Indian Cave. The note to set up the state was, I feel, a direction that the state was to be prepared behind the black curtain, during the progress of the remainder of Act IV, in preparation for Act V. The scene which has been cut here is, curiously enough, one about which we know a good deal. The original scene picture-drop had been the subject of litigation between the King's Company and one Isaac Fuller, a painter, who had been commissioned to prepare a scene of "Elysium" for the original production of Tyrannic Love in 1669. In final settlement with him, the company had been forced to pay him the sum of £335 10s. 7 After the destruction by fire of the Theatre Royal in Bridges Street on January 25, 1671/2, the King's Company lost almost all their stock of scenery and costumes, and the company was in shaky financial condition. In fact, the losses from this fire eventually caused them to be swallowed up by the Duke's Company in the so-called Union in 1682. It would seem highly likely that, after the fire, the company would restage a play which had been as popular as Tyrannic Love, 8 but it seems equally unlikely that they would again expend a large sum of money for a scene which at best was brief on the stage and which could not conceivably be used for any other play. On this basis, the probability is strong that the Folger prompt copy represents the manner of presentation of the play after the fire, and that it was prepared as a substitute for the manuscript or original prompt copy which had doubtless perished in the flames. 9 Although Act IV contains no further entries except for the customary "Musique," Act V has another point of interest. It opens with the notation "Draw y e Curten &amp; Sett up y e wheele." Another note on the same page states, " U y e Chy Chayre at y e head of y e Stage" (p. 48 [376]). Letters in italics have been crossed out). This chair is probably for Maximin to occupy during the execution spectacle. On the death of Valerius, after Maximin "Spurns the body," according to the printed stage direction, appears the manuscript notation, "Caryded off" (p. 59 [387]), a necessary direction, as the scene immediately opens to disclose the spectacle of Berenice on the scaffold. In this scene there is one important manuscript stage-direction which moves the entry of Valeria up eighteen lines so that she enters on the cue, "But yet remember me when you are dead." This early entry has much to recommend it, for it enables Valeria, who is in love with Porphyrius, to overhear him and Berenice exchanging their vows of eternal love on the scaffold. At no other point in the play has Valeria discovered the identity of her rival for Porphyrius, yet after she has stabbed herself, she says, thinking she sees Porphyrius, who has left the stage, "Is Berenice still more fair than I?" Berenice and Porphyrius have been reassuring each other that they will meet in Heaven, and if Valeria has not overheard this, then her desire to "sigh her Soul into her Lover's Eyes" has less meaning than if it is interpreted as a desire to be in heaven first to beat Berenice there. This early entry, then, has considerable textual weight, and is the last significant notation of C, since the only other entry of his is "Musique" at the end of the play, but before the Epilogue. After the death of Betterton, Tyrannic Love seems to have been dropped from the repertory, and the prompt copy may have passed into the possession of A. This would seem to be the natural line of descent, as A was still enough interested in the play to fill the volume with notes and poetic comments. At some subsequent time B had access to the volume and completed the marking. Although the prompter's notations are not so numerous as we might wish, two significant changes were made: the cutting of the Elysium scene, and the early entry of Valeria in Act V. This copy, then, is of some importance for an editor or student of this play.</field>

Osborn, "Macdonald's Bibliography of Dryden: An Annotated Check List," MP , XXXIX, (1941), 85. These changes, other than the added scene of 39 lines, are not extensive, representing largely verbal improvements. No significant changes were made in the stage directions. 3 Page references will be given both to the 1672 quarto (Macdonald 74b) and to the Montague Summers edition of the Dramatic Works ; this reference is, then p. 1 [335]. Tyrannic Love appears in vol. II of Summers' edition. 4 P. 29 [359]. The word "black" can confidently be reconstructed, as it appears again later in connection with the same setting. 5 P. 29 [360]. The cut extends from line 16 to line 201, pp. 29-35 [360-364]. 6 P. 35 [364]. The bottom part of the words within brackets is visible, and the reconstruction is fairly certain. The four question marks indicate a gap before the tail of the "y" which leaves room for a word of about four letters of which no trace remains. The word "down" might be suggested to fill the gap, but I have so little confidence in it that I have not ventured to place it in the brackets. 7 Leslie Hotson, The Commonwealth and Restoration Stage (1928), pp. 251-253. 8 Nicoll records a performance at court for Tyrannic Love for May 18, 1676: History of Restoration Drama , 3rd. ed.

Fuller pointed out in his claim that the play had run for fourteen days at about a hundred pounds a day income, while, he continues, the normal income from a play was forty or fifty pounds a performance. See Hotson, op. cit. , p. 252. 9 The evidence presented does not preclude the possibility that this prompt copy was made for a production in the provinces, but even if this were the case, it is likely that any production of the play after 1672 must necessarily be something like that represented by the markings in the Folger copy, and on the basis of this cutting, a reasonable idea can be gained of the manner of production of the play in London from the time of the fire until the death of Betterton.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Variant Sheets in John Banks's Cyrus the Great , 1696 * Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">COPIES of John Banks's play Cyrus the Great (1696), the first edition, exist with sheets B, C, and D in two completely different typesettings but without change in text. In the setting which I shall identify as (*), the second line of the opening stage-direction on sig. B1 ends with the word " Battel " and B2 is not signed. On C3 v the reading in line 3 is "express'd" and in line 29 "bred"; on D1 the catchword is "Adorn'd" and on D4 the catchword is "Thy". In the other setting, identified as (§), the direction on B1 ends " Battel where- " and B2 is signed; the readings on C3 v are "Express'd" and "bread"; on D1 the catchword is, correctly, "Let" and on D4, incorrectly, "They". The central problem, since it is a matter of prime textual importance, is to determine the order of setting and printing these variant sheets: because one is a straight reprint of the other, only that setting made directly from the manuscript can have authority. Ordinarily, in an examination of this sort, one seeks to determine priority by analytical bibliography, which, if one is fortunate, may decide the issue on the laws of mechanical evidence without calling on the less demonstrable inferences of textual criticism based on the variant readings. 1 In Cyrus the Great the bibliographical evidence, in its salient features, conforms so strongly to a certain well-established pattern of printing that an assumption can be made about priority on this evidence alone. However, the case is not an open and shut one, for there remain some difficulties, and at least two alternative hypotheses can be evolved to fit the facts. As a consequence, it will be more appropriate to survey the textual evidence first to see whether its findings will coincide with what seems to be the preferred bibliographical explanation. Textual evidence is of two varieties. The first is concerned with the relative "goodness" or "badness" of the readings in an attempt to demonstrate that one version of a text is more correct than another. The second, with less concern for correctness, tries to determine whether one set of variants would evolve more naturally from the other than in the reverse direction. Taking only the substantive variants between these three sheets, we see that of the total of nine, a more correct reading is found six times in (*) against three times in (§). When these are viewed more narrowly, however, it is apparent that there is a real difference between the kinds of faults corrected. Thus (§) properly corrects the simple misprint of "Doys" to "Days" (B1 v , l. 38), "no" to "not" (B4 v , l. 31), and "thy" to "the" (C1 v , l. 12); but when serious variants occur, such as the dropping in (§) of "to" in "to Cyrus " (B2, l. 15), and the omission of "Was" in "Was Hystaspes " (B4 v , l. 29), it is (*) which is always the correct text, in addition to such variants as the correct "adorn" (B1, l. 44) in (*) against the "adore" of (§) or the correct "all my" against "my all" (D2 v , l. 29). In the matter of substantive readings there is little question that (§) is a comparatively degenerate text, and this deterioration (an almost invariable accompaniment of reprints) is customarily taken by textual critics as proof of later typesetting. The degree of correctness in the accidentals of a text is less good evidence, for in reprints one may often find substantive degeneration accompanied by somewhat superior punctuation, usually in a fuller system. For the record, however, it may be stated that of the fourteen clear cases where there can be no question of superiority in the punctuation by Restoration standards, (*) is the more correct eleven times, and (§) only three. Of five cases of elision for metrical reasons against non-elision, (*) is correct in all. This evidence for the priority of (*) conforms to our general experience with texts, but it comes far short of actual demonstration, since the argument is always plausible that the earlier setting was particularly careless and has been corrected in the later. And, in fact, so far as one can determine from the readings, there is only one (§) variant—the omission of "Was" in "Was Hystaspes " (B4 v , l. 29) —which would be really difficult for a compositor to mend if (*) were, instead, the later setting. Other evidence may be adduced, however. For example, on D2 v the catchword in (*) is "Have" but in (§) it is correctly " Cyr. " for the first words on D3 which are " Cyr. Have. . . ." The setting of a catchword omitting a speech-heading is a not uncommon characteristic of dramatic texts set from manuscript but I have not observed it in reprints, in which a compositor may check on the correctness of a catchword but seldom alters it in favor of an incorrect one. Somewhat similar is the incorrect catchword "Adorn'd" on D1 of (*), which is right for the first word of the second line on D1 v but is properly changed to "Let", the first word of the first line, in (§). Again, this is an error found in texts set from manuscript, in which it may probably be assigned to wrong marking of the stopping point, or to a skip of the eye, but it is not characteristic of reprints. 2 Finally, certain inferences may be drawn from the variant spellings in the two settings of the sheets, but this can be applied only in connection with the interpretation of the bibliographical evidence, and will thus appear later. When we move to the bibliographical evidence for the printing of this book, the following facts appear. Cyrus is a quarto, collating A-H 4 I 2 , the preliminaries occupying sheet A and the text beginning with a head-title on B1. The text concludes on I1, followed by an epilogue on I1 v and I2, and advertisements on I2 v . Although there is no break in the text, clear differences occur in the printing of sheets B-E (including both settings of B-D) and of sheets F-I. Most prominent is the fact that though the font of type remains the same, and the vertical measurements of the type-page are almost identical, the printer's measure ( i. e. , the length of the printer's composing stick as evidenced by the measurement of a full line of type) switches from 119 mm. in B-E (including both settings of B-D) to 123 mm. in F-I. Also, sheet A is set to this 123 mm. measure. To complete the evidence that different skeleton-formes were used for the two sections, this alteration in the typographical layout is accompanied by different settings of the running-titles in each part. Sheet E, then, is the only sheet which was not reset in the first section composed with the 119 mm. stick, and this fact becomes of considerable importance. In the (*) setting of B-D, each sheet was printed with two skeleton-formes, one for the inner and a different one for the outer forme; on the evidence of the running-titles, these two skeleton-formes were also employed to impose the type-pages of the respective formes of sheet E, thus establishing a firm link between the printing of invariant sheet E and the (*) sheets of B-D. In setting (§), on the contrary, a completely different group of running-titles is found, not elsewhere repeated in the book. This group is found in only one skeleton-forme, however, which was used to impose both the inner and outer formes of B-D. The running-titles of F-H are in different settings, and of a different font, from any in either setting of B-D and of course from E. The group used in the skeleton for inner F also printed outer G, and that for outer F appears again in inner H. Inner G and outer H were each printed from skeleton formes differing from each other as well as from those in the rest of the book. The single running-title in half-sheet I, that on I1, does not seem to be found elsewhere either. The same typesetting of the words "Cyrus the Great" found in the head-title on sig. B1 of setting (*) —but differing in (§) —appears as the first line of type on the title-page on A1. Finally, of the eighteen copies of this book I have examined to date, six contain the (*) B-D sheets, and twelve the (§) setting. If we were acquainted with this book only in the (*) state, there would be little hesitation in interpreting the evidence as indicating a book in which the manuscript was halved and the two parts B-E and F-I plus A were simultaneously set and printed on two presses. This was a common way of printing Restoration plays, the division of pages is nearly equal, and point by point the facts correspond to the pattern for such printing established in other books. 3 The evidence of this printing is in all essentials so strong that it must, I think, be taken as the basis for any plausible hypothesis about the book. If we accept it, at least for the moment, then under any normal conditions the use of the same skeleton-formes in sheet E in the same positions as in (*) B-D would indicate seriatim printing and thus that the (*) setting is the original one. This was the tentative conclusion of the textual evidence, and it may be strengthened by the spelling, which demonstrates that the compositor of (*) B-D also set sheet E. The strongest single piece of evidence to this effect is the spelling "Battels" which occurs three times in (*) B-D and once in l. 8 of E2 v . Interestingly, we find that the (§) compositor followed the "Battels" form in its first appearance in the stage-direction on B1, but in the other occurrences spells it "Battles." He would not, therefore, seem to be the compositor of E2 v . Correspondingly, we find that the single occurrence of the word "sence" in l.3 of D2 v is matched in spelling by "Sence" in line 23 of E3 v although the (§) compositor changed the D2 v spelling to "sense." There is probably a parallel here to the spelling in l.12 of B1 in (*) as "ascent" but in (§) as "assent." In B1, B2 (twice), and C4 v we find the (*) spelling "o'er" which also appears on E2, E3, E3 v , E4, and E4 v . In the four occurrences noted in B and C, the (§) compositor changed the spelling to "o're," although he followed "o'er" under the influence of his copy once on B3 v and once on D3. I can make nothing of the differences in capitalization habits between the two compositors, but it is worth mention that such characteristic spellings as disclous'd, Genious , and uncontroull'd from (§) where (*) is conventional, find no place in sheet E. Against this cumulatively invariable evidence that E was set by the compositor of (*) B-D, the one scrap of negative evidence is the spelling Stroak on E3 v matching up with Shoar on (§) B2 as against Shore in (*). So far it would seem that the building of the hypothesis has followed Sir Walter Greg's (and Whitehead's) advice to "seek simplicity." The book conforms to the standard patterns for two-section simultaneous printing. Under such conditions, the evidence of the running-titles and of the spelling characteristics indicates that sheet E not only was set by the compositor of (*) B-D but also followed these sheets on the press, and is, therefore, the original and only authoritative setting. All that remains is to evolve a satisfactory theory to account for the resetting of B-D. Here the pertinence of Greg's full quotation, "Seek simplicity, and then distrust it," becomes apparent, for no thoroughly satisfactory theory occurs to me. There are two standard reasons for such resetting: (1) short printing of the original sheets either as a result of a miscalculation or of a decision to enlarge the edition after a certain number of gatherings had already been machined; (2) an accident happening to the sheets. There are various reasons for being distrustful of the first. If we take it that short printing of B-D occurred by a miscalculation, we are faced with the uncomfortable situation of imagining that in a book simultaneously composed and printed on two presses in the same shop, 4 a major misunderstanding about the size of the edition-sheet could go undetected for several days although the paper was being brought out from the warehouse and given to each press and the printed sheets taken away to be dried. Moreover, the number of preserved copies does not encourage this theory. It is very odd indeed that of the eighteen I have seen, the proportion has been two to one in favor of what seems to be the later setting. With all allowances for the operations of chance, it would seem that at a minimum the supplementary printing would need to have been larger than the original, and this would have meant a remarkably small edition-sheet for the miscalculating press. Finally, we should need to assume that sheet E was machined to the full number of sheets. If so, then the point at which the change in estimate was made becomes of crucial importance, for it is a very curious fact that no standing type appears in reset sheet D. For example, if the error was discovered during the printing of the first forme of E to go on the press, it is not very likely that there would have been time to distribute the type from both formes of D. 5 If the decision was not made until sheet E was perfecting, it must have been very early, for neither forme of E shows any signs of having been unlocked. Under these circumstances, the first forme would not have been broken into but would have been held intact to perfect the additional white paper printed by what had been the perfecting forme. This is possible, of course, but it still assumes a rapid though not incredibly expeditious distribution of all of sheet D. Nevertheless, if it occurred, we may legitimately enquire why the skeletons of E were not used to impose reset B-D, for we should expect that the additional sheets of B-D would be printed immediately. On the other hand, if the error was discovered early in printing the first forme, we could believe that the initial forme of B could be quickly set by casting off copy and would be ready for the press before any skeleton of E could be released. This theory would explain the new skeleton, but it does not explain why none of the type of D was left standing if the change was made so early. However, one forme of B might still be set if the decision were made early in the perfecting, so that even the perfecting skeleton might not be available when reset B was prepared for its press. Still, it is odd that—on the evidence of the spelling—a new compositor was assigned for the (§) setting of B-D, although the original compositor should have been free. In my opinion the lack of standing type remaining from D, the construction of a new skeleton-forme for the reset printing, and the change in compositors all combine to argue against the immediate printing of reset B-D. It is true that a delay in this printing, though abnormal, would not destroy the theory of short printing, but a delay is better explained by some other hypothesis. To complete the arguments, one should mention that it is very odd to find two skeleton-formes employed in setting (*) if the original edition-sheet was as small as it would need to have been. On the evidence of the spelling, only one compositor set (*) B-D, but with about half a normal edition-sheet, he could not have kept up with the press and therefore would not have imposed with two skeleton-formes. 6 The same arguments operate with even added force against a hypothesis that a decision was made to enlarge the edition-sheet sometime during the printing of E, for in such a case there would have been every incentive to machine reset B-D immediately, and to save as much standing type from D as possible. In addition, there is the uncomfortable matter of the proportion of the preserved copies. But the really crushing argument against this theory is that it will not conform to the hypothesis of two-section simultaneous printing, for by the time E was printed, the workmen assigned to F-I and A must have finished their job, or been fairly close to the end. 7 On the evidence, a sufficient number of sheets was printed for all of the second section. The alternative, an accident to a large number of sheets of B-D, fits the case perfectly for a delay between the printing of sheet E and the reset sheets, since it allows for D to be distributed as well as the skeletons of E, and for a different compositor to appear on the scene. Moreover, there need be nothing odd about the proportion of copies preserved. The one really disturbing matter is its vagueness. What kind of an accident could affect what seems to have been an equal number of sheets 8 in three successive gatherings and not affect the fourth? Moreover, this accident would need to have occurred after sheet E was printed, but before all the sheets were folded and collated for delivery to the publisher. 9 No satisfactory explanation occurs to me save to conjecture that originally only about a third of the edition, represented by the (*) setting, was collated for binding in order to satisfy the initial demand, the remainder being stored packaged by sheets. If, before these sheets were opened and gathered, an accident happened to the packages containing B, C and D, they would need to be reset, and we should find the consistent copies exemplified by the eighteen examined, with three sheets either in the (*) or the (§) setting. It seems necessary, therefore, even at the risk of unduly extending this examination, to survey as briefly as possible other theories which might fit the facts to see if any other is preferable. If we adhere to the initial hypothesis for two-section simultaneous printing, then it would seem impossible to reverse the order of the settings of B-D, even though the proportion of copies I have seen suits (§) as the original better than (*). Until sheet E is printed, the book cannot be bound. If we suppose that the resetting (*) was not decided on until E was at press, we cannot explain the construction of new skeleton-formes for E which are thereupon used in the resetting. Moreover, there is the fairly clear fact that E was set by the compositor of (*) and not of (§). Since any tortuous explanation of the use of the skeleton-formes must necessarily involve the immediate resetting of B-D, we cannot explain why no standing type from D was preserved. Finally, we cannot escape these various objections by supposing that the decision to enlarge or to overprint was made while D was on the press. In such a case there would have been an over-run of at least one forme of D, and preservation of standing type. Also, if D were on the press, the compositor would necessarily have already set some of E, but on the spelling evidence he did not. 10 It will be clear that the original hypothesis advanced must hold (whatever the explanation) provided we continue to accept the interpretation of the evidence that the book was simultaneously set and printed in two sections. It is legitimate to enquire, therefore, whether a reasonable alternative can be adduced. In fact, a somewhat plausible set of inferences, of a quite different cast, can be contrived involving seriatim typesetting for the whole, at least as the original plan. For example, if a decision were made to enlarge the size of the edition while sheet E was on the press, two-section printing might have been introduced at this point consequent upon the necessity to reprint B-D. If this were so, we should have a situation differing materially from the first hypothesis. Since the book would not have been planned from the start as a two-section job, sheets F-I would not have been printed simultaneously with the first setting of B-D but, instead, at the same time as the second setting. In this manner the facts of two-section printing would be reconciled with the theory of an enlarged edition, a theory which must be rejected if two-section printing had been planned from the start. There is much that is attractive about this hypothesis. The use of two or more presses in the second section is explained by the necessity to print four and a half full sheets while a single press is reprinting three sheets in smaller quantities. This hypothesis can be maintained, however, only if we discard the theory that press I (for the first section) printed (§) B after completing the last forme of E, for otherwise the compositor would have used the first wrought-off skeleton from E for his imposition. If, therefore, (§) B did not follow E, the alternative is that E (at least as a whole) did not follow (*) D on the press. 11 The hypothesis, then, must be altered to place the decision to enlarge the edition late in the machining of the second forme of D. By this time the compositor should have set up to E4 and possibly even E4 v . If, thereupon, before press I had finished machining (*) D, its compositor began the resetting which resulted in (§) B, it would have been possible for press I to have printed the first forme of E in order to keep busy and then to have swung over to (§) B, leaving the perfecting of E to press II or III while its compositors were setting F and G. The timing would apparently be right for such a schedule, and the construction of a new skeleton for the B-D resetting would be explained, together with the absence of compositor I's setting in F. That F-I did not thereupon employ the skeletonformes of E would doubtless result from their changed measure which would have necessitated the cutting of new furniture reglets. The prime difficulty in accepting this theory is the fact that no standing type from (*) D was preserved, although it would have been available, to save time and money in printing reset (§) D. This is so inexplicable, indeed, that it should cause us to be more than ordinarily suspicious, the more especially since it explains on largely fortuitous grounds the equal division of a book between two or more presses, which we are accustomed to view as the result of the simultaneous printing of the two sections. Moreover, on the spelling evidence, the compositor of reset B-D was not the same workman as that of the original sheets, whereas the theory almost positively requires him to be one and the same. Finally, the proportion of the respective settings of B-D in the preserved copies argues strongly against a hypothesis based on the enlargement of an edition-sheet. These are such strong reasons that I do not believe we can accept this alternative. If, in a last desperate attempt, we reverse the order of the B-D settings, we are up against the reasonably clear textual, spelling, and semi-bibliographical evidence that (*) was the first; we should need to assume that E (on the evidence of its (*) running-titles) was not machined until the last operation although it must have been set earlier; we are faced with the strong probability that E, nevertheless, was set by the (*) compositor; and we still cannot explain the lack of standing type in D. It would seem that the most prominent alternatives involving any probability in normal printing practice fail to satisfy the prime requirements for any satisfactory hypothesis, which must explain (a)- the proportion of variant B-D sheets in the observed copies; (b) the lack of standing type in D; (c) the different skeleton-forme in reset B-D; (d) the equal division of the book between two or more presses; (e) the change of compositors between the two settings of B-D. The only theory which will fit every one of these facts is the original one, which introduces the plan for two-section printing from the beginning, and posits a delay before the reprinting of the reset B-D sheets. The only difficulty in full acceptance of this hypothesis is the vagueness of the explanation, involving some peculiar sort of accident to three successive sheets. But until a better explanation occurs to someone, I believe this is the theory we must hold. Regardless of the explanation for the how and why, however, it would seem sufficiently clear that the (*) setting of B-D, the details of which were described at the start, is the original and only authoritative form of the text in these sheets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * This note is part of an investigation of the Bibliography of Restoration Drama under grants from the Research Council of the Richmond Area University Center and the Research Committee of the University of Virginia. 1 A classic example, which I shall always remember, is my wrong "critical" assignment of priority to a resetting in Dekker and Middleton's Roaring Girl (1611), properly reversed on strict bibliographical evidence by J. G. McManaway. See my "Thomas Dekker: Two Textual Notes," The Library , 4th ser., XVII (1937), 338-340; and McManaway, "Thomas Dekker: Further Textual Notes," The Library , 4th ser., XIX (1938), 176-179. Another example, which I can mention with pleasanter associations, is my bibliographical investigation of the order of the two 1669 editions of Dryden's Wild Gallant in The Library , 5th ser., V (1950), 51-54; see also Studies in Bibliography , III (1950), 52-57. 2 This catchword correction is of some real interest. Under ordinary circumstances a compositor of a reprint follows regularly the catchword on the recto page of his printed copy, since he must turn the page to know whether it is right or wrong, and thus original variants between catchwords on the recto pages of successive editions and following words on the versos often become perpetuated. On the other hand, for a reprint to make such an error would be most difficult to explain. Simple misprints, of course, do occur, as the misprint "They" in the D4 catchword of (§) for the correct "Thy" of (*). 3 For various examples, see my "Bibliographical Evidence from the Printer's Measure," Studies in Bibliography , II (1949), 156-162. 4 It would be much more plausible to find a miscalculation about the size of the edition-sheet existing if the two sections of the book had been printed in different shops. But the fact that the standing type from the (*) head-title was used on the title-page printed by the workmen of the second section is sufficient evidence that the two parts were manufactured in one house. 5 Since type was not distributed until its skeleton-forme had been stripped, and this stripping was not accomplished until the next forme was ready to be imposed, we should also need to suppose that the compositor had made an almost immediate imposition of the second forme of E from the skeleton of the last forme of D, although the press would not require the forme for some time. However, this is not impossible. 6 The relation of the compositor to methods of imposition according to the speed of the press governed by the size of the edition-sheet is a technical matter carefully studied by C. J. K. Hinman, "New Uses for Headlines as Bibliographical Evidence," English Institute Annual, 1941 (1942), pp. 207-212. 7 The pattern of the four (probably five) sets of running-titles in F-I is clearly not that associated with one-press printing and instead indicates that two or more presses were assigned to the section. It would, therefore, be printed more quickly than B-E if both had started at the same moment. But there is nothing against a delay in beginning the second section that would cause both sections to be finished at about the same time. 8 So far I have seen no mixed copies. 9 According to Moxon, at this date it was the printer's duty to fold the sheets and collate them into separate copies, ready for the binder, before delivering them to the stationer. Of course we do not know that this was the invariable practice, but evidence exists to suggest that it may well have been the usual one. 10 If one wants to lean the maximum weight on the evidence of he spelling of "Battels" versus "Battles," the appearance of "Battels" on B1 in both settings is most readily explained as inadvertent following of the (*) copy by the (§) compositor, whose normal spelling habit thereafter asserted itself. If so, (§) would necessarily be the resetting. 11 The difficulties in the order of (*) D followed by E have already been sketched in another connection. They consist chiefly in the fact that the compositor of E, on the evidence of the measure, did not compose any part of F, although shortly after the first forme of E was delivered to the press he should have begun this setting. The lack of standing type from D is also a difficulty which has been discussed.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Swift's Verses on the Death of Doctor Swift H. Teerink</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN The Book Collector's Quarterly , II (March, 1931), 57-73, Herbert Davis has drawn attention to the fact that there are three versions 1 of "On the Death of Doctor Swift": (A) The Life and Genuine Character of Doctor Swift . . . . London, J. Roberts, 1733. This has 202 lines. Professor Davis says that it is to be taken as a seemingly spurious, but really genuine, production of Swift's pen, secretly handed by him to the press through the Reverend M. Pilkington, with an intention to show Pope his displeasure at the way in which Pope had edited Swift's works in the Miscellanies , vol. III, 1732. (B) Verses on the Death of Doctor Swift . . . . London, C. Bathurst, 1739. This has 381 lines. Swift had entrusted the (C) version to Dr. William King for publication in London. King consulted Pope, and on the advice of the latter radical alterations were effected by the omission of about 160 lines and all the notes, and by the insertion of 60 lines from the (A) version. This is therefore "an edited and unauthorized edition." 2 (C) Verses on the Death of Dr. S----, D.S.P.D. . . . Dublin, George Faulkner, 1739. This has 484 lines. It is the genuine version as Swift wished it published by King in London. In Faulkner's edition of Swift's Works , vol. VIII (1746), both the (A) and (C) versions were printed. There were, however, some previously unnoticed clandestine editions of the (B) version in 1736, that is, more than two years earlier than the Bathurst 1739 edition listed by Davis. Here follows a list of them, preceded by two editions of Pope's Essay on Man to serve as material for comparison. (I) An | Essay | On | Man. | In | Four Epistles to a Friend. | [rule] | Corrected by the Author. | [rule] | The Seventh Edition. | [rule] | [ornament] | [double rule] | London: | Printed for J. Witford, near the Chap-|ter-house, St. Paul's. Mdccxxxvi. Sm. 8° (4's): [A] 4 B-F 4 ([A]1 and F4 [blank?] missing). 2 pp. (title, verso blank). 4 pp. (contents) . [1]-37 (text). [38] (blank). This is No. 419 in R. H. Griffith's A Pope Bibliography . He considers it a pirated edition, pointing to the intentional misprint of "Witford" for "Wilford", the publisher of the genuine edition of 1733. (II) The same title as that of (I) except: 'London: | Printed for J. Witford, near the | Chapter-House, St. Paul's. M.DCC.XXXVI.' 12° (6's): (unsigned) pp. [i-ii] (title, verso blank). [iii]-vi (contents). [7]-38 (text) This is Griffith, No. 420. He says that this is a different printing from (I), and probably pirated from it. (III) [caption-title, p. 3]: [decorated bar: stencils] | Verses | On The | Death of Dr. Swift. | Occasioned by reading the following Maxim | in Roachfoucault [ sic ]. | Dans l' adversite de nos meilleurs amis nous trouvons toujours | quelque chose, qui ne nous deplaist pas . 12° (6's): A 6 (A1 wanting), pp. [1-2?] 3-12. Copy: Nat. Libr. of Ireland. Unfortunately the title-leaf is lacking. It is possible (?) that there should also be a frontispiece. (IV) An | Essay | On | Man. | With some | Humourous Verses | on the | Death of Dean Swift . | Written by Himself. | [ornament] | Dublin: | Printed, &amp; Sold by the Booksellers of | London &amp; Westminster. | [rule] | MDCCXXXVI. 12° (6's): (frontispiece +) [A]1 B-D 6 E 2 (frontispiece +) χE 6 . 2 pp. (front.). pp. [i-ii] (title of 'Essay', verso blank).

The title 'Verses' reads: 'Verses | On the Death of | Dr. Swift . | Occasioned by reading the following Maxim in | Rochfoucault . | Dans l'adversite de nos mellieurs [sic] amis nous trouvons tou-| jours quelque choses [sic], qui ne nous deplaist pas . | Written by Himself; Nov. 1731. | [ornament] | Dublin , Printed: | London : Re-printed, and sold by the | Booksellers of London and Westmin-|ster.'

Witford, near the Chapter-|House , St. Paul's . M.DCC.XXXVI. 12° (6's): A-D 6 (D6 wanting). pp. [i-ii] (title, verso blank). [iii]-vi (contents of 'Essay'). [7]-38 ('Essay'— Finis at foot of p. 38). [39]-46 ('Verses'). Copy: Bibliothèque Mazarine, Paris (42481). The caption-title on leaf D2 for the Verses reads: '[decorated headpiece] | Verses | On The | Death of Dr. Swift. | Occasioned by reading the following Maxim | in Rochfoucalt [sic]. | Dans l'adversite de nos meilleurs amis nous trouvons toujours | quelque chose, qui ne nous deplaist pas .' This Mazarine volume contains three separately-paged pieces: (1) 'The Hind and Panther' (lacking two leaves in front, and a blank (?) leaf at the end), (2) The 'Essay' and the 'Verses' (as above), and (3) The 'Dun-ciad', London-Dublin, G. Faulkner, &amp;c., 1728 (Griffith No. 206). The volume is preceded by a MS title: 'The Hind and Panther an heroic poem wrote by M r Dryden with several other curious poems by the celebrated M r Pope and Swift London printed in the year 1756.' It is impossible to say (1) whether these three pieces (and perhaps more?) were really published with a printed title dated 1756, or whether the MS. title only represents a plan for a made-up miscellany in that year; (2) whether the leaf or leaves lacking at the end of the Verses bear the rest of the poem only, or more. (VI) An | Essay | On | Man. | In | Four Epistles to a Friend. | [rule] | Corrected by the Author. | [rule] | A New Edition. | [rule] | [ornament] | [rule] | London: | Printed for, and sold by the Booksellers, | in Town and Country. Sm. 8°: A 4 B-D 8 . pp. [i-ii] (frontispiece). [iii-iv] (title, verso blank). [v]-viii (contents of 'Essay'). [1]-35 ('Essay'). [36] (blank). [37]-47 ('Verses'). [48] (blank). Copy: British Museum (11631.bb.25). The caption-title on p. [37] reads: '[decorated bar: stencils] | Verses | On The | Death of Dr. Swift. | Occasioned by reading the following Maxim | ['in' omitted ] Rochfoucalt [sic]. | Dans l' adversite de nos meilleurs amis nous trouvons toujours | quelque chose, qui ne nous deplaist pas .' A comparison of the texts of editions (III), (IV), (V), and (VI) — photostats of all these are in my possession—with the Bathurst folio edition shows the following variants: Bathurst fol. 1739 [1] (5) Rochfoucault [1] (8) Rochfoucault 2 (3) my Friend 2 (16) the Case 6 ( 3) their Tenderness 6 (16) they talk 7 ( 4) his Judgment 7 ( 8) Prediction 11 (18) Vole 15 ( 5) slobber'd 15 ( 7) Councils 18 (11) Theirs the Blame (IV) U.

They all have 'Corrected by the Author', 'The Seventh Edition', and practically the same imprint. Professor Griffith, pointing to the spelling 'Witford' for 'Wilford' (the name of the publisher of the original genuine edition of the Essay on Man , London, 1733-34), which he considers intentional, is of the opinion that (I) is a piracy, and (II) probably a piracy of (I). Though the titles of (V) and (VI) are different, the identical text readings show that (VI) must have been printed from (V), while the words 'A New Edition' may point to an edition later than 1736. It is clear therefore that (I), (II), (V), and (VI) are in some way related, and they may be said to form one group. Another thing that strikes us is that (IV) is an altogether different venture. Internally, it is characterized by a wealth of capitals, against a great scarcity in the other three printings. It has a frontispiece (bust of Swift), a separate title for the Verses , and there is a greater attempt at ornamentation (ornaments on the title-pages; a headpiece and decorated capital on page 3 of the Verses ). These details all make an impression of a production superior to the other three. Moreover, the title of the Essay is the only one that does not read 'Corrected by the Author', and also the only one that mentions the Verses specially, and adds 'Written by Himself, Nov. 1731', which goes back to the 1733 [A] edition. The imprint of the Essay says: 'Dublin: Printed', that of the Verses 'Dublin, Printed: London: Re-printed', which cannot but be a "blind", 3 because nobody in Dublin could have had command of the [B] version in 1736, unless it had secretly been sent there for publication, which is very improbable. The Bathurst folio of 1739 must have been printed from it. There is the same wealth of capitals. The text variations are the same; two corrections are for the better: 'their Tenderness' for 'his Tenderness', and 'his Judgment' for 'the Judgment'. On the whole the affinity is clear and unmistakable. Only the National Library of Ireland copy, (III), remains. It is to be regretted that the absence of the title-page (and perhaps a frontispiece?) robs us of some valuable evidence. If a complete copy should ever be discovered, I should not be astonished to find an imprint with 'Dublin, Printed, &amp;c'. It is a cheap production without ornamentation or capitals, carelessly set with several misprints, suggesting a slovenly manuscript, and lack of skill in compositor or proofreader. If I were allowed a guess, I should judge it the first printing of all, a separate publication, secretly handed to the press, and almost immediately reprinted as an addition to the Essay to both sides, (IV) and (V), with the advantage decidedly on the side of (IV). Although we do not know the date on which Swift sent his manuscript of the [C] version to Dr. William King for publication in London, there is some indication as to this date in King's letter 4 from Paris to Mrs. Whiteway of Nov. 9, O. S., 1736, where he speaks of two manuscripts, (1) "the little manuscript", which he had already received, and which he intended to put to the press, "and oblige the whole English nation", on his arrival in London, after Nov. 20; (2) "the History [of the Four Last Years of the Queen]", which was not sent to King until some months later, 5 in July, 1737. It is safe to assume that "the little manuscript" was the [C] version of the Verses , because as we have seen above, some "edited" editions of it really appeared in 1736. In a letter 6 to Swift of Jan. 23, 1739, when the Bathurst [B] version had just been published, King refers to "the form in which this poem now appears", making special mention of the omission of two passages, "the story of the medals", and "the designs of the Ministry on the death of Queen Anne", without, however, speaking of the 60 lines added from the [A] version, which makes us wonder whether he was aware of them or not; while in a letter 7 of Jan. 30, 1739, to Mrs. Whiteway he says that he had consented to the alterations "in deference to Mr. Pope's judgment, and the opinion of others of the Dean's friends in this country . . .". He also expressed his great fear that Swift might be dissatisfied with "the liberties I have taken", promising that he would still have the poem published in its original shape, if Swift positively wished it. 8 We cannot waive aside the impression that King, beyond his function as a "publisher," for which in his letters to Swift and Mrs. Whiteway he accepted the responsibility, knew very little about the matter. He knew about the omissions, but he does not speak of additions. Apparently he had left the "editorship" entirely to Pope, probably even the proofreading. And it is certain that about the clandestine editions of 1736 King knew nothing at all. In his letter to Mrs. Whiteway of Jan. 30, 1739, occurs this passage: "It may not be amiss to tell you, that one Gally, or Gaillie, since this poem was printed, offered it to sale to a bookseller at Temple Bar; and I am now told that there are two or three copies more in London. Gaillie pretends that he is just come from Ireland, and that he had directions to publish the poem here; so that perhaps the whole may at last appear, whether he [ i.e. Swift] will or not." From these words it is clear that King thought that Gaillie had a manuscript of the [C] version to sell which came direct from Ireland (it does not matter here that his fear was ungrounded, for this version was never published in London; and that as to the "two or three copies more in London", by which only the 1736 editions can have been meant, he reported no more than hearsay, not knowing what to make of it). The evidence adduced yields a procedure similar to that in the case of the Letters Between Swift and Pope, 1714-1736 , London, 1741, so ably described by Dilke and later by Elwin; with Pope as the auctor intellectualis , and King little more than a tool; namely: a pseudo-surreptitious printing to suggest that a stolen manuscript had reached the press, (III); followed by a reprint purported to have been derived from a Dublin edition, in order to be able to lay the fault there, (IV); and finally the 'genuine' edition. The question may be asked: Was Pope to blame for the part he played? In his New Light on Pope (1949), the late Mr. Norman Ault has tried to exonerate Pope of several cases of trickery and deceit hitherto laid to his charge; and it cannot be denied that Ault has succeeded in several respects. But we are inclined to wonder if, with a critic's love of his author and his author's works, he has not gone a little too far. Mr. Ault sees no estrangement 9 in the friendship between Swift and Pope after the publication of Vol. III of the Miscellanies , 1732, a question which still requires a close investigation; and though he speaks of "the admittedly dubious affair of the Letters ", 10 he finds a good deal of excuse in Pope's activities even here, and calls Dilke and Elwin's attempts to clear up this affair "diatribes". 11 If Mr. Ault had been acquainted with the case under discussion, he would no doubt have reasoned thus: Pope was so careful of Swift's Verses that he treated them as his own and "edited" them; but being also anxious about his friend's safety, he took recourse to clandestine publication, which had the additional advantage of ascertaining the reception of the poem by the public; only when he saw that the Government took no offence, he cooperated in the 'genuine' edition. For the sake of Pope's reputation let us hope that this is the correct interpretation. However, it remains strange that King was left uninformed as to the clandestine publications and that his suspicions were not even roused.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Adam Clarke's Bibliographical Dictionary (1802-1806) Francesco Cordasco</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADAM CLARKE (1762?-1832), the theologian and orientalist, is remembered for his monumental Commentary on the Holy Scriptures (8 vols., 1810-1826), and for the Arabic bible he prepared for the Foreign Bible Society. 1 His oriental studies were assumed for the scriptural studies that lay ahead, and as he progressed in his investigations he interrupted his labors between 1802-1806 for a bibliographical dictionary whose scope is best indicated by the reproduction of its cumbersome title: A | Bibliographical | Dictionary | Containing a chronological account, alphabetically arranged, of | the most curious, scarce, useful, and important | Books | In All Departments Of Literature, | which have been published in | Latin, Greek, Coptic, Hebrew, Samaritan, | Syriac, Chaldee, Aethippic, Arabic, | Persian, Armenian, &amp;c. | From the infancy of printing to the beginning of the | Nineteenth Century. | With Bibliographical Anecdotes of Authors, Printers, and Publishers; | . . . a distinct Notation of the Editiones principes and optimœ . . . and | the Price of each Article (where it could be ascertained) from | the best London Catalogues, and public sales of the most valuable | Libraries, both at home and abroad. | Including the Whole of the Fourth Edition of | Dr. Harwood's View Of The Classics | With innumerable Additions and Amendments. | To which are added | An Essay on Bibliography, | With a general and particular Account of the different Authors | on that Subject, in Latin, French , Italian, German , and English . . . | A Description of their Works; first, improved , and best Editions | . . . with critical Judgements on the whole extracted from the best | bibliographical and typographical Authorities. | And an Account of the best English Translations of each | Greek and Latin Classic. The work, in eight parts, appeared in Liverpool printed by J. Nuttall for W. Baynes of London. The oriental volumes of the Dictionary were obviously suggested by Clarke's rich holdings in orientalia, 2 and his inclusion of the Latin and Greek Classics was intended to make his work complete. Guides to the Latin and Greek Classics had long been available, and Clarke took as his guide in the matter the popular work by Harwood. 3 Beyond his ever increasing collection of orientalia, Clarke must have used a small reference library which was already available for works in Coptic, Hebrew, Samaritan, Syriac, Chaldean, Ethiopian, Arabic, Persian and Armenian languages. It is odd that he fails to mention any of these references by name, but his labors were greatly facilitated by their consultation, and in substance his Dictionary became an incorporation of the titles in these works into one alphabet with, ostensibly, additions and observations. Since Clarke does not mention these references they may well be listed: Carl Heinrich Tromler, Bibliothecae coptoiacobiticae specimen . Lipsiae 1767. pp. 78 (some 200 titles). Giovanni Bernardo de Rossi, Dizionairo storico degli autori ebrei e delle loro opere . Parma 1802. pp. viii, 192, 170 (some 1750 titles). Stephanus Evodius Assemanus et Joseph Simonius Assemanus, Bibliothecae apostolicae codicum manuscriptorum catalogus . . . Partis primae tomus primus, complectens codices ebraicos et samaritanos . Romae 1756. pp. lxxvi, 499 (some 500 titles). Joseph Simonius Assemanus, Bibliotheca orientalis clementinovaticano, in qua manuscriptos codices syriacos, arabicos, persicos . . . Bibliothecae vaticanae addictos, recensuit . . . Romaae 1719-28. pp. xlii-649; clxxii, 548; xxxvi, 709; xxxii, cmlxiii. (some 1500 titles). Hiob Ludolf, Bibliothecae regiae berolinensis Aethiopica . . . Erlangae 1752. pp. lxxix. (some 25 titles). Excepting the Hebrew materials, for which Clarke found a ready store of information, his other titles for the Eastern literatures were largely drawn from the titles listed above with constant addition from his own collection. The formidibility of Clarke's Bibliographical Dictionary is indicated in the simple quantitative comparison of its 25,000 odd titles with the aggregate 6000 (including Harwood) titles of his sources. Patently, this was an achievement, and Clarke with some modesty noted that his "chief aim has been to insert useful and important articles, together with whatever he knew to be curious and scarce " (Advertisement). He was quick to add that "those who have the smallest acquaintance with the difficulty of compiling such a work as the present, will not be surprised to meet with several mistakes, and will not be hasty in censuring." ( idem ). The Bibliographical Dictionary , itself, is in one author alphabet, and the usual entry includes anecdotes of the author (sometimes with source), notices of the best edition (s) of the works and, if available to Clarke, price of editions and recent auction sale records. Occasionally the author-alphabet is broken for the alphabetical inclusion of series of volumes ( e.g. the Aldine Classics), or for a collective heading e.g. "Bible." This was recommended, and some of these collective entries achieve an amazing length and quality. The collective entry "Bible" occupies pp. 185-288 in volume I, and is continued in an appendix of 15 pp. (II, 1-15). The fullness of Clarke's references remain unmatched. Neither Watt in his Bibliotheca Britannica (4vs. Edinburgh, 1824) nor Lowndes in the Bibliographer's Manual (10vs. rev. Bohn, 1858-64) under their listing for "Bible" even approach Clarke's entry. Yet both Watt and Lowndes had used Clarke as a source. Within the area that it has defined (and its title is the best guide to this area) the Bibliographical Dictionary is unrivalled. Take for further illustration the entry for Cicero (II, 187-235). The logical point of comparison would be Harwood, but it is deficient alongside Clarke. Perhaps T. F. Dibdin's An Introduction to the knowledge of rare and valuable editions of the Greek and Latin Classics (Gloucester, 1802), which went through four editions, the last in 1827, might be adjudged, but it too does not equal the wealth of information found under Clarke's "Cicero," and at times Clarke even exceeds the expectation, as for example his quotation of the complete colophon for the Vindelin de Spira edition of the Ciceronian Epistolae (folio 1471): Tullius ingenua praefulgens mente solebat, Has Cicero claris mittere patriciis, Marco respondet multa quos arte notarant, Eloquiam priscis summo in honore fuit. And this magnificent bibliographical survey of Cicero is followed by several pages of biographical matter in which Clarke quotes Quintilian, Bayle, and Dr. Blair on the merits of the orator's study. Clarke reserved the 7th and 8th parts of his Bibliographical Dictionary for a Bibliographical Miscellany which contains an invaluable "Catalogue of Authors and their Works on Bibliography and Typography divided into four Classes". 4 Here, in the absence of a history of bibliography, is an important working tool which the modern bibliographer can use as the grundriss for 17th- and 18th-century bibliographical history. The entries once again are in an author-alphabet, with occasional interruption, and the calendar of names is, in effect, a history.

Under each of these names Clarke lists the important work and then makes some critical judgment. In many cases by immediate reference to works that he has cited he is able to illustrate the importance of the work under consideration in the history of bibliography. Actually, this "Catalogue of Authors and their Works on Bibliography" is his general working reference-library for the problems that arose in the compilation of the Bibliographical Dictionary . In the Advertisment to the first volume of the Dictionary most of them are named. When Adam Clarke turned away from his completed bibliographical labors in 1806, he turned away with some reluctance. It is interesting to see that his Memoirs of the Wesley Family (1823) was more concerned with the bibliography of Methodism than with the history of enthusiastic piety.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Murray Reprints of George Grabbe: A Publisher's Record Franklin P. Batdorf</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN the nineteenth-century business records of the publishing house of John Murray, in London, are data not elsewhere available regarding the publication by Murray of George Crabbe's works after the poet's death. 1 These records contain an account of the reprints of both the eight-volume edition which first appeared in 1834 and the edition complete in one volume which was published first in 1847. The information concerning the number of copies received from the printer, the dates when they were received, and the rapidity of the sales should be useful to students of Crabbe's success and reputation as well as to librarians, collectors, and bibliographers. For the present this information must be regarded as a means of checking bibliographical evidence rather than as definitive material, since even a superficial preliminary survey reveals discrepancies between the publisher's records and the bibliographical facts which can hardly be accounted for without a thorough study of the extant volumes themselves. 2 The Murray stock books make clear, however, that the eight-volume edition came out originally in monthly numbers, as the dating, February-September, in Huchon's list of the publications of Crabbe suggests. 3 The original printings of the first two volumes are dated in the stock book February and March, respectively; and those of the other volumes are dated specifically the first day of each succeeding month. 4 Apparently, Huchon did not make use of the Murray stock books. I find no mention of them in his study, the scope of which, indeed, hardly includes the history of the Murray editions published after Crabbe's death. The dates recorded in the stock books for the reprints of these individual volumes throw doubt upon Bartholomew's listing of the reprints of 1835 and 1836, in which it is indicated that the set was reprinted in toto in both of these years. 5 The stock books show that all of the volumes were reprinted once during 1835, but in three different groups. 6 There is no record in the stock books, moreover, of any reprint of Volumes III and VIII during 1836. At the moment it is impossible to say whether any copies of these two volumes were issued with cancel titles bearing the date 1836. This seems improbable on account of the variety of dates in extant copies of this eight-volume set, which suggests that no effort was made to achieve the appearance of uniformity. This variety of dates is accounted for by the indication in the stock books that between December, 1834, when the entire set was reprinted, and February, 1847, when it was reprinted again, there were many reprints of individual volumes or groups of volumes, but none of the set as a whole. 7 Thus the suspicion of numerous cancel titles is somewhat allayed, and the impulse to assume frequent reprints of the whole set with numerous shiftings, by booksellers and other owners, of copies from one issue to another is held in check. The table below summarizes the facts as to the dates of the reprints. The records of the number of copies disposed of are a little less clear than those of the dates of the various reprints, because some of the entries showing numbers of copies disposed of seem to represent an accumulation and not to belong specifically to the dates assigned to them. This is indicated by several facts: first, that there is only one entry showing the number of copies of Volume I presented as gifts; second, that this number and the numbers of copies in the entries showing coffee-house sales are comparatively large; third, that these figures representing accumulations are rather infrequent for some of the years covered by the records; and fourth, that in a few cases the number of copies recorded as having been sold by a certain date exceeds the number recorded as having been printed by that date. It is possible, however, to get a fairly trustworthy idea of the rapidity of the sales of the various volumes of this edition as well as of the issues that were printed together as sets, for the total number of copies disposed of plus the number not disposed of corresponds exactly to the number printed. I shall give the record of the number of copies printed as it appears in the stock books, because these entries are intelligible without interpretation. But instead of putting down all the various entries in the records of sales, I shall summarize these and relate them to the records of printings. The reprints of the individual volumes of Crabbe's works are recorded in the stock books as follows: THE EIGHT-VOLUME EDITION OF CRABBE'S LIFE AND WORKS INDIVIDUAL VOLUMES Table of Printings 8 Date Number of Copies Printed Volume I II III IV V VI VII VIII Feb., 1834 7,090 March, 1834 5,062 April 1, 1834 5,062 May 1, 1834 5,040 May, 1834 504 June 1, 1834 5,098 July 1, 1834 5,092 Aug. 1, 1834 5,100 Sept. 1, 1834 5,064 Sept., 1834 504 502 Dec. 1, 1834 506 506 504 504 506 506 1,000 Dec., 1834 502 Feb. 25, 1835 502 490 June 19, 1835 505 500 506 506 506 Sept. 19, 1835 504 April, 1836 252 250 502 252 250 252 June 7, 1836 250 June 7, 1837 250 Jan., 1838 250 252 252 254 250 Feb., 1839 250 July, 1839 250 Feb., 1840 252 252 252 252 252 252 252 Sept., 1841 250 Dec., 1842 250 250 250 Dec., 1843 252 252 Jan. 1, 1844 234 March, 1844 252 Dec., 1845 252 252 252 March 1, 1846 252 9,589 7,580 7,330 7,290 7,358 7,362 7,368 7,572 Although the column for each of the volumes in the 1832 stock book ends with the notation "To new book," I have found no entries in the next book, the one opened in 1844, for any of the volumes except the first, and only one for that, i.e. , the one for January 1, 1844, given in the table above. Perhaps the phrase "To new book" refers to the records of the reprints of the set as a whole, which do appear in the 1844 book; or perhaps when the new book was opened it was contemplated that there might be further reprints of the individual volumes. In any case, I believe that these records as I have given them are complete, since they extend through 1846, the year before the set as a whole was reprinted. Regrettably, the stock books do not indicate whether the type for any of the volumes was distributed and re-set between 1834 and the last reprint of the set. 9 Nor do they show whether all of the printing was done by Spottiswoode. This writer has seen no copies of any of the volumes bearing the imprint of any other printer; and Spottiswoode is mentioned in the 1844 stock book as the printer of the 1847 issue. The records of sales indicate that up to and including the year 1846 the individual volumes were disposed of as follows: THE EIGHT-VOLUME EDITION OF CRABBE'S LIFE AND WORKS INDIVIDUAL VOLUMES Table Showing Disposal of Copies 10 Year Taken Over by Booksellers, Sold at the Murray Shop, or Presented Volume I II III IV V VI VII VIII 1834 7,751 5,914 5,671 5,477 5,377 5,357 5,316 5,551 1835 541 455 444 509 501 481 506 573 1836 273 256 246 252 316 308 298 324 1837 250 217 214 224 232 236 242 225 1838 150 137 131 113 134 161 148 147 1839 122 131 52 123 116 139 141 139 1840 12 22 22 16 17 17 17 27 1841 82 77 72 82 76 75 75 84 1842 118 117 122 110 120 126 125 123 1843 17 15 14 17 12 22 23 10 1844 167 128 136 142 136 163 166 146 1845 43 82 32 28 38 23 31 31 1846 24 8 46 45 48 58 58 52 9,550 7,559 7,277 11 7,138 7,123 7,166 7,146 7,432 To new book 39 21 53 152 235 196 222 140 5,589 7,580 7,330 11 7,290 7,358 7,362 7,368 7,572 The rather extreme fluctuation of sales for the eighteen-forties suggests the possibility that some of the sales may have been recorded for the wrong year, perhaps on account of the use of a lump figure representing transactions over a period of time; but, as I have already said, the total number of copies disposed of corresponds exactly to the total number printed. I have not found any record of the disposal of the copies which are designated as carried over to the new book, but the general trend of the demand for these volumes is clear enough nonetheless. It is interesting to note that the Volume I, containing the memoir of Crabbe, sold better than any of the volumes of his poetry except Volume II, which contained the poems that appeared first in 1807, and that Volume I maintained its position fairly consistently throughout the period represented by the figures. This fact is accounted for partly, of course, by the fact that the memoir was a new work. Although Crabbe's biography can scarcely be expected to have had a sale comparable with that of Boswell's Life of Johnson , also chronicled in the Murray stock books, it may nevertheless be worth mentioning that from 1835, when the house of Murray brought out the latter in ten monthly volumes, until 1839, these volumes sold roughly at the rate of 900-1000 copies each per year. The superior popularity of Volume VIII is doubtless due also to the fact that its contents, the Posthumous Tales, were appearing for the first time. It is to be noted that Volume VIII tends to lag behind the others after the first three years following publication. The principal significance of these figures, of course, is that they indicate how rapidly the popularity of Crabbe declined in the years following his death. It is to be remembered, however, that what we have here is only a partial record. The publication of Crabbe by other houses doubtless contributed to the decline of the sale of the Murray edition; but we cannot say how much. 12 Unfortunately no figures are at the moment available showing the rapidity of the sales of the editions brought out by other publishers. The story is carried forward by the record of the printing and disposal of the eight-volume set as a whole. The stock books indicate that it was printed as follows: February, 1847 Life and Works Complete, 8 vols. Spottiswoode Fcap 8 vo 252 January 1, 1849 Reprint 252 Returned by Trade 24 --- 528 1853 Reprint 250 --- 778 13 The probable meaning of the item "Returned by Trade" is that some of the copies which had been taken over by booksellers or coffee houses and recorded as having left the stock room were returned, so that when these were again disposed of their number was again added to the record of copies taken from the stock. The number of copies returned had to be added to the record of stock received from the printer in order to make the books balance. The number of copies of the set printed, then, was 754 instead of 778. The 1849 and 1853 reprints have not been listed by Crabbe's bibliographers, nor have I seen copies of them. 14 The following table is derived from the stock book record of the disposal of these complete sets: THE EIGHT-VOLUME EDITION OF CRABBE'S LIFE AND WORKS COMPLETE SETS PRINTED IN 1847, 1849, AND 1853 Table Showing Disposal of Copies 15 Year Copies Disposed of Year Copies Disposed of 1847 240 1858 9 1848 20 1859 30 1849 50 1860 9 1850 131 1861 7 1851 51 1862 7 1852 119 1863 1 1853 1 1864 2 1854 23 1865 8 1855 24 1866 2 1856 19 1867 4 1857 21 --- 778 (total) Since the last recorded sale is dated April 4, 1867, and since the total number of copies disposed of equals the number received, the eight-volume set must have gone out of print at that time, except for a few copies of volumes printed individually before 1847 which may possibly have been left. 16 Since the eight-volume edition was in competition with the one-volume edition as early as 1847, the significance of the record of sales of the former will not appear until after I have given the figures for the latter. The Murray records show printings and reprintings of the one-volume edition as follows: Crabbe's Life &amp; Works Clowes March, 1847 One Volume, Royal 8 vo 2000 Overplus 23 ----- 2,023 Nov. 13, 1850 Returned by trade 46 Feb., 1851 " " " 38 Dec., 1850 Second edition 1,011 July, 1854 Returned from shop 2 ----- 3,120 17 Crabbe's Works Clowes Aug. 11, 1854 1 vol. royal 8vo 1,010 June, 1860 Returned from trade 10 Mar., 1861 ................ shop 4 ----- 1,024 999 ---- To other edition with plates 25 18 1901 1,010 I have not seen the stock book entry for the 1901 reprint; it was transcribed for me by Mr. James Farquharson, of the house of Murray, who has told me that the volume has not been reprinted since that time, and has given me the following additional information from records accessible to him: The Poetical Works of Crabbe with his Letters and Journals and his Life was published by Murray, with illustrations, in seven parts royal octavo at one shilling each in 1860; 19 then in 1866 a one-volume edition made up of previously published monthly parts was issued with a new volume title. 20 The Murray records add one reprint, that of December, 1850, to the list of reprints of the one-volume Murray edition given by Crabbe's bibliographers. The reprint listed by Huchon as belonging to the year 1867 may be the title-page edition of 1866, as the date on the title-page would probably be 1867 if the edition was issued late in the year 1866. Bartholomew, however, lists a one-volume edition for 1866. The records of the disposal of the one-volume edition which I have seen extend only through the year 1854. They show the following: THE ONE-VOLUME EDITION OF CRABBE'S LIFE AND WORKS Table Showing Disposal of Copies 21 Year Copies Disposed of 1847 1,765 1848 72 1849 132 1850 502 1851 238 1852 125 1853 269 1854 17 ----- 3,120 These figures account completely for the first and second issues of the one-volume edition, but for no others. The belief has been expressed to me by Mr. Farquharson that the one-volume edition is not even yet quite out of print. The demand for Crabbe's works in the forties and fifties of the nineteenth century can be seen more clearly from a combination of the sales figures for the eight-volume set with those which are available for the one-volume edition. These combined figures are given below: THE EIGHT-VOLUME AND THE ONE-VOLUME EDITION OF CRABBE'S LIFE AND WORKS Year Copies Disposed of 1847 2,005 1848 92 1849 182 1850 633 1851 289 1852 244 1853 270 1854 40 It is regrettable that this series cannot be continued, for it would be interesting to know whether the slump of sales in 1854 represented a trend. Perhaps it did not do so any more than did the low figure for 1848. On the whole these data do not give the impression that all interest in Crabbe ended with his life. To be sure, the number of purchasers of his works was small in the years immediately preceding 1847, when Murray's two complete editions were published, and in the following years as well; but the sale of two thousand copies by a single publisher in 1847 and the comparatively steady sale in the following years are impressive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I am grateful to Sir John Murray, K.C.V.O., D.S.O., and to Mr. John Grey Murray for their kindly permitting me to examine these records at their offices in London, and for their other kindness and assistance. 2 For example, in the New Orleans Public Library there is a copy of the eightvolume edition in which the title-pages of Volumes IV, V, VI, and VIII bear the dates 1845, 1843, 1843, and 1845, respectively; but the Murray records do not mention any reprints of these volumes in these years. One may guess that Volumes IV, V, and VI were dated 1845, 1843, and 1843, respectively, because they were printed in December of the preceding year; but the date of Volume VIII cannot be accounted for in this way. 3 René Huchon, George Crabbe and His Times (1907), a translation by Frederick Clarke of Huchon's Un poète réaliste anglais (Paris, Librairie Hachette, 1906). 4 Stock book dated 1832. 5 A.

Since the figures representing sales are not entirely legible in the stock book, the discrepancy is probably due to an error in my interpretation of these rather than to an error in the totals. I have therefore given the totals as they appear in the stock book. A further argument in favor of these totals is that the total number of volumes disposed of plus the number carried over to the new book agrees with the figure given in the record of printings for the total number of copies printed. The validity of this argument is perhaps slightly questionable, however, since it is not certain that the figures showing the number of copies carried over represents an actual count. 12 See Bartholomew's bibliography. 13 Stock book dated 1844. 14 In addition to the lists of Crabbe's publications previously mentioned there is one by H. G. Pollard in the Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (1941). 15 Stock books dated 1844 and 1854. The twenty copies which I have indicated as disposed of in 1848 are recorded in the stock books for 1847. The monthly dates, however, and the fact that there is no other record of sales for 1848, suggest that these belong to the latter year. 16 Stock book dated 1854. 17 The record from March, 1847, through July, 1854, is from the stock book dated 1844. 18 The record from Aug. 11, 1854, through the item "To other edition with plates" is from the stock book dated 1854. The figure 999, presumably, represents sales. 19 Mr. Farquharson's source for the foregoing was John Murray's Official Quarterly List dated October, 1860. 20 These records do not account clearly for the one-volume edition with a printed title dated 1861 and an engraved title dated 1860. Bartholomew lists such an edition with plates, and a copy (also with plates) is extant in the Howard Memorial Library, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana. Possibly the twenty-five copies issued with plates were so dated. See the table above. 21 Stock book dated 1844.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Printer of Harvard's Humble Proposal (1659) Bertram C. Cooper and Richard E. Hasker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ABROADSIDE, An Humble Proposal, for the Inlargement of University Learning in New England, by the Trustees hereafter named, to whom the management of this Affair is committed , printed in 1659 for the purpose of raising funds in England for Harvard College, is listed by Evans in his American Bibliography as the work of the Cambridge Press in Massachusetts, 1 but Winship, without stating his evidence, assigns the printing to England. 2 Dr. Lawrence Starkey has called attention to the fact that neither the factotum nor the type used in the Humble Proposal is to be found in other products of the Cambridge Press, although the watermark in the paper on which it is printed is also found in paper used by this colonial press in its books at approximately the same time. 3 This last is an interesting coincidence which, if taken alone, might lend support to Evans' opinion that the broadside was published in America. However, the more important evidence of the factotum may now be utilized to demonstrate the correctness of Winship's assignment of the printing to an English press. The factotum is a conventional design measuring 59 x 60 mm. At the top a column, centered over the mortise, is placed between two cherubim, below each of which is a cornucopia, the one on the left of the mortise being topped by a stylized rose, the other by a thistle. At the bottom a fleur-de-lis directly beneath the mortise separates arabesques which extend upward and interwine with the cornucopias. Finally, the whole design is surrounded by double lines, the outer much thicker than the other. In his study of the ornament stock of Thomas Newcombe, Dr. C. William Miller has reproduced this factotum and identified it as belonging to the stock that came to Newcombe in 1648 when he married Ruth Raworth, the widow of the printer John Raworth. 4 The reproduction, no. 3 in Dr. Miller's set of illustrations, is taken from The Compleat Ambassador (Wing D1453), by Dugley Digges, which Newcombe printed in 1655 for Gabriel Bodell and Thomas Collins. When four years later the factotum appears in the Humble Proposal (1659), a conspicuous crack, not present in the earlier occurrence, is to be found at the top just off-center right in the heavy outer line. Mr. John Wyllie, Curator of Rare Books at the University of Virginia Library, has called our attention to the use of the same factotum in two official documents; (1) An Act for Confirming Publick Acts (comprising signatures D and E immediately following signature C of Wing E994 in the ViU MacGregor set of Charles II Statutes), dated May 8, 1661; and (2) the ViU copy of A Proclamation of Grace, for the Inlargement of Prisoners called Quakers (Wing C3523), dated May 11, 1661. Though both bear the imprint of John Bill and Christopher Barker, the King's Printers, identity of detail and the presence of the break in the upper edge prove that these publications contain the same factotum used by Newcombe and the printer of the Humble Proposal (1659). The latest use of the factotum Miller records is in The Works of Richard Hooker (Wing H2631), which Newcombe printed in 1666. In all of these later appearances there is a noticeable deterioration of the edges of the mortise. Mr. Wyllie has also found that the precise book in which the crack in the edge of the factotum first occurred is John Rushworth's Historicall Collections , which George Thomason entered in the Stationers' Register on September 14, 1658, and which Newcombe printed for him in 1659, the same year in which the Humble Proposal was printed. On B1 r of this book the line around the factotum is unbroken, but on A2 r in the preliminaries, which were undoubtedly machined last, there is present the crack noted in the 1659 broadside and in all subsequent publications containing the factotum. 5 From this evidence it is apparent that the printing of the Historicall Collections was finished before May 11, 1659, the date of the Humble Proposal , and that the factotum had been cracked between that date and the preceding September. Newcombe's ownership of the factotum can easily be reconciled with its appearance in the two 1661 documents which have the Bill and Barker imprints. According to Plomer, John Bill and Christopher Barker, who were reinstated as King's Printers in 1660, did not themselves print the books whose imprints bear their names, but farmed them out to their assigns. 6 Furthermore, Newcombe, as an assign of John Bill, was the printer and manager of the King's Printing Office from the Restoration until 1677, when he and Henry Hills were appointed King's Printers. 7 This association, then, explains the presence of the Newcombe factotum in An Act for Confirming Publick Acts (1661) and A Proclamation of Grace (1661), both of which Newcombe must have printed himself. The constant appearance of the factotum in Newcombe books identifies him as the printer of the Humble Proposal in 1659. The only alternative, that the factotum was loaned to the Cambridge Press to print the broadside and then returned to London, is sheer fantasy. Its appearance in the books discussed above is therefore sufficient proof that Winship was correct in denying the Humble Proposal to the Cambridge Press and assigning it to England.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Belcher &amp; Armstrong Set Up Shop: 1805 Rollo G. Silver</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ON an April day in Boston in 1798, a boy celebrated his fourteenth birthday by deciding that the time had come to escape from his unendurable lot in life. After his father's death, his mother had placed him with his uncle, and the youngster at this time was working in his uncle's Boston paint shop. Little Samuel T. Armstrong, waiting on trade, grinding paints, lugging the family groceries, blacking boots in the cold winter nights, bitterly determined to win independence. Chancing to see an advertisement for a printer's apprentice, the boy called, one evening after work, at the office of Manning &amp; Loring on Spring Lane. He explained his plans to James Loring, offering to make his own agreement, and showed so much ambition and promise that, in spite of the novelty of the arrangement, he was promptly signed on as an apprentice. 1 In February, 1800, when Joseph T. Buckingham arrived at Manning &amp; Loring as journeyman printer, he found Armstrong still the youngest apprentice: "His duty (like that of all youngest apprentices) was to kindle the fires, sweep the floor, pick up the scattered types, distribute pi , and tread the pelts ,--an operation exceedingly filthy and disgusting." 2 And, as Buckingham recollects, he "passed through this state of tribulation," finishing his time of service in April, 1805. He remained at Manning &amp; Loring as journeyman for approximately six months, but the job did not satisfy him. Nor did being a journeyman printer satisfy his friend Joshua Belcher, twenty-one years old, who had just served his time on the Independent Chronicle . Belcher and Armstrong, therefore, decided to enter into partnership as book and job printers. They bought the Boston Magazine from Gilbert &amp; Dean and in October, 1805, opened their printing office on the second floor of an old building at 70 State Street. 3 The expenses incurred in the establishment of this office are itemized in the final pages of Armstrong's journal. The list contains needed information about the economy of nineteenth-century American printing, and it is presented in the hope of stimulating the publication of similar material.

Furthermore, it must be noted that, in addition to the British importation mentioned here, some type was purchased from Binny &amp; Ronaldson, for soon after the opening of business Belcher &amp; Armstrong advertised an "elegant" assortment of type from the "American Foundery." 12 And they also announced that the Boston Magazine was printed with type manufactured in this country. 13 The Boston Magazine was succeeded by the Emerald , another literary magazine which was published from May, 1806, to October, 1807, when it was sold to Oliver C. Greenleaf. The major work of the office seems to have been devoted to books, job work, and pamphlets. In 1807, the firm joined with Oliver &amp; Munroe to issue the first Boston edition of Shakespeare's Poems . Independently, they issued James Montgomery's Wanderer of Switzerland [1807?], William H. Brown's Ira and Isabella (1807), G. W. Fitzwilliam's Pleasures of Love (1808), and other books. For one pamphlet, the Trial of Thomas O. Selfridge [1807], the partners showed their resourcefulness by obtaining professional reporters from New York or Philadelphia since there were none in Boston. 14 Despite such enterprise, the printing business continued to be a financial struggle. In April, 1808, they formed a publishing association with W. P. Farrand, D. Mallory, and J. Morse, and moved the Belcher &amp; Armstrong print shop to the floor above the bookstore of Farrand, Mallory &amp; Co. 15 There they published the Panoplist , a religious and missionary magazine, but business was unprofitable, and in December, 1808, the firm of Belcher &amp; Armstrong was dissolved. Though there was much pamphlet and job work, Armstrong declared in his journal, it enabled him to clear nothing—"probably not so much as journeyman's wages for 3 yrs. &amp; 3 mos." Joshua Belcher lived in Boston as a printer until he died in New York on September 4, 1816, at the age of 32. 16 Armstrong set up a printing office in Charlestown, eventually opening a bookstore at 50 Cornhill, Boston, about 1811. There he acquired the wealth and public esteem he desired. Not only did he retire a rich and independent man, but he served the community as Representative to the General Court, State Senator, Lieutenant Governor, and Mayor of Boston. Armstrong died in 1850, a prototype of the Horatio Alger hero who raised himself from rags to riches by the correct combination of business acumen and virtue. 17</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Twenty-Eight Additions to the Canon of Lowell's Criticism F. DeWolfe Miller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL'S extensive critical works cover the period between Dante and the mid-Victorian era so much more systematically than those of any other nineteenth-century American critic, that the identification of twenty-eight additional critical notices in the North American Review would scarcely be worth publication were it not for a continuing and lively controversial interest in his critical accomplishment. Upon Lowell's death in 1891, Stedman, himself a very active critic, unhesitantly pronounced that Lowell was thus far the greatest of American critics. Doubters and detractors quickly appeared; but despite the attacks which have been made on Lowell's superficiality, he has continued to the present day to find notable defenders. The addition of a number of critical notices and reviews will therefore have some significance: it will increase our knowledge of his reading habits; and, as the bulk of his known criticism deals with major authors of the past, these new pieces will enlarge our knowledge of his opinions of current literature. Horace E. Scudder's James Russell Lowell (1901) contained such a careful calendar of first publications—whether in newspapers, periodicals, or in separate volumes or pamphlets—that George Willis Cooke, when he prepared a book-length bibliography in 1906 managed to introduce more typographical errors than he did new items. Both Scudder and Cooke used, among other materials, the large mass of manuscripts and other literary remains which Lowell left with C. E. Norton. Why they did not use, or made such poor use of, the 1878 index to the North American Review remains unexplained, unless, depending on Lowell's papers, they merely overlooked it. The index was prepared by a Harvard librarian, William Cushing, and was published quite separately from the Review itself. Thus it may have escaped their notice just as it escaped the notice of a more recent distinguished scholar who was attempting a complete bibliography of his subject. The North American had begun to emerge from anonymity in 1868, ten years before the index was prepared, but even after the index appeared, the current critical notices (as distinguished from the articles) remained unsigned. Cushing, then, had the dual task of making an analytical index and of determining the authorship of articles some of which had been published over sixty years before. In his Preface he said, "The fullest sources of information, in regard to past and present writers, have been opened to me by the past and present editors . . . except Dr. Palfrey, . . . who is too infirm to give me any information." 1 Since some of the past editors were already dead, the statement is ambiguous. Nevertheless, as Lowell's editorship was later than Palfrey's, Cushing obviously means that Lowell, among others, aided him in determining the authorship of anonymous articles and reviews. No matter how accurate or inaccurate the information Cushing received concerning other contributors, Lowell's list of his own materials must have been fairly trustworthy. As he had contributed at least eighty-five items, he could not, five years after the close of his editorship, have relied on memory. It would seem that, barring clerical and typographical errors in indexing, the provenance of the twenty-nine additions to the canon (in the first list below) is fairly clear. There can be only a slight doubt about the seventeen items which are listed without the comment, "In author index only." Each of them appears at least twice in the index, and is attributed to Lowell in each entry. The authenticity of the remaining twelve, the notices which are indicated as appearing in the author index only, must be examined more closely. The index is divided into two sections, subject and author. The analytical subject index is much the longer, for some articles and notices are listed under several headings. However, the author index is more nearly complete, since Cushing has throughout the subject index omitted certain critical notices which appear in the author index. He ineffectually explains in his Preface that the listing of some of the notices could serve no purpose. His choices for omission are quite arbitrary, for he includes some trivial materials and omits what today at least would be considered far more important. In the author index there appears under the name of each author a chronological list of his contributions, designated by short title and a numerical reference, except for the fact that in the case of Lowell and a few other frequent contributors, some, though not all, of the critical notices (never any of the "articles") are gathered at the end of the list where they appear under the heading "Critical Notices" and are designated only by issue number and notice number. Here an undetectable typographical error in one figure would result in the attribution to Lowell of a piece not his. However, a reindexing of the sixteen volumes edited by Lowell reveals in 1600 entries in Cushing's index four typographical errors in numerical reference, or only one to every 400 entries. The chance of a typographical error, then, in twelve items is very small. Even if an error occurred, it would have little chance of escaping detection. Any reference out of sequence would obviously be wrong; moreover, all but ten of 500 critical notices are indexed, and an incorrect attribution of a notice to Lowell would conflict with one or more entries elsewhere in the index. There are two errors in page composition affecting the 190 entries of Lowell's contributions, but they are immediately obvious, and do not concern the new items listed. Clerical errors are more numerous in the index. Among 1600 entries covering about 800 articles, reviews and notices published during Lowell's tenure, six critical notices are attributed to different authors in different parts of the index. Two of these affect the Lowell canon. 2 They appear in the "Doubtful Authorship" list below, where it is noted that one of them previously ascribed to Lowell is almost certainly the work of Norton, the very active associate editor. A file of the North American Review built up at the time of publication by the Widener Library at Harvard contains penciled notations of authorship. The inscriptions covering Lowell's editorship are primarily in two hands, with one item marked by a third hand. It is apparently unknown who made these notations or to what extent Cushing relied on them. They confirm the additions to the Lowell canon listed below, with the exception of the review of Hale's If, Yes, and Perhaps, which is not marked. 3 Yet another record—Norton's memorandum book, which is owned by the Houghton Library—mentions a few of the items. On a left-hand sheet in the notebook he recorded the plans for a future issue; later he recorded the actual contents on the opposite sheet, giving the authors and the amount they were paid. Norton, in this somewhat sketchy record, attributes a significant review of Howells' Venetian Life to Lowell, while Cushing in both sections of his index gives it to Norton himself. The contradictions concerning this short notice (the Widener copy gives it to Norton, Scudder does not include it in his list of Lowell's works, and Cooke gives it to Lowell) indicate that no published records of Lowell's unsigned and uncollected writings can be trusted absolutely. Cooke, though he gathered much valuable bibliographical information in the field of New England letters, can never be trusted where he cannot be checked. Compared with Cushing's index of the Lowell material Cooke's bibliography is virtually corrupt. While there are only four typographical, clerical, and composition errors in Cushing's 190 entries for Lowell, Cooke, in fifty-eight entries from the North American, makes eleven errors, or proportionally nine times as many. The errors include wrong page, wrong volume, wrong year, wrong spelling of names, and the misspelling and alphabetization of Chaucer as Church , not to mention the listing in two different places of a review by Lowell as a review of one of Lowell's works. He omits without explanation five reviews (listed below) attributed to Lowell by both Cushing and Scudder. Judging by Cooke's other work, these omissions were oversights. Certainly the failure to include the review of Ward's life of Percival was careless, for Lowell had already collected it himself. Internal-external evidence will support Cushing's attributions of several of the notices. This evidence cannot be analyzed here, but the student of Lowell will recognize references to previous criticisms definitely known to be by Lowell, and he will note numerous links such as that in the review of Froude's History of England in which Lowell repeats very closely the phraseology of his judgment of Froude's sympathetic handling of Henry VIII, which he had used two years before as an example in "The Rebellion: Its Causes and Consequences." 4 Critical Notices by Lowell Published in the North American Review but not heretofore Included in Bibliographies of his Works (Unless otherwise indicated, each item below is credited to Lowell at least twice in Cushing's index.

      <field name="heading_text">A Note on Lowell Bibliography: The Review of Howells' Venetian Life James L. Woodress, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE North American Review index long has given Charles Eliot Norton credit for writing the most interesting notice of Howells' first important book; 1 yet Lowell almost certainly was the real author. Although the bibliographers of both Howells and Lowell have suspected Lowell's authorship, 2 no one so far has assembled conclusive data to settle this question. There is, however, ample evidence, both external and internal, to show that Lowell undoubtedly wrote the essay. When Howells was hunting for an American publisher to share with Trübner and Company of London the risk of bringing out Venetian Life , he asked Lowell's aid in placing the book with James T. Fields. Lowell, however, was unable to interest Fields in publishing it and was forced to write: "I did what I could with F[ields]. about the book, but to no end. I expected as much. But see if I don't say a good word for it when it is published. There I have my own way." 3 The following year, as advance copies came from the press, there was no doubt in Howells' mind that Lowell would review the book, for he wrote his publisher, M. M. Hurd, in August, 1866: "I shall send it to Mr. Lowell, who says he will notice it in the next N. American Review , and to Mr. Norton, who, I think, will review it in the Nation , though of course I cannot state my expectation to him." 4 Howells was correct in believing that Norton would review his book; the marked file in the Nation office supplies this corroborative evidence. Proof that Lowell wrote the essay on Venetian Life in the North American Review rests on internal evidence supported by the improbability of Norton's authorship of both notices. Lowell was the logical person to undertake this task because of his close personal friendship with Howells. He had known Howells since 1860, had published his first contributions to the Atlantic , had accepted his initial offering to the North American Review . This review was obviously written by a man who knew Howells, for it discusses at length his Midwestern background and early literary career. It also dwells at length on an idea which long had fascinated Lowell, the idea of "the unexhausted West," and to this end it glowingly pictures Howells as the self-taught Westerner storming the citadels of Eastern culture. The entire essay, moreover, lavishes praise in the manner Lowell customarily adopted when writing about his friends. In addition to a dissimilarity of tone and content between the two reviews, there is one factual discrepancy which virtually eliminates the possibility of single authorship. This occurs in the matter of referring to Howells' forty-five month foreign residence. The North American Review article speaks of his four years abroad, while the Nation cites his three-year sojourn. Since the former figure is so nearly correct, it seems inescapable that Lowell, who was Howells' best friend in Cambridge, wrote the former review. Howells did not make Norton's acquaintance until after he returned from Italy and assumed his editorial duties on the Atlantic .</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The First Printing of Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio William L. Phillips</field>
      <field name="fulltext">STUDENTS of eighteenth-century bibliography have for some time recognized the value of contemporary periodical reviews as evidence in determining the order of editions or issues of a book. Such reviews may also have use in determining more recent "firsts," as the following consideration of the first printing of Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio (New York: B. W. Huebsch, 1919) will indicate. Winesburg, Ohio is one of the fictional works of the past fifty years which seems certain to survive, and as such it has attracted the attention of those who have been concerned with the study of American first editions. Merle Johnson in 1929 wrote that the distinguishing points of the "first issue" ( i.e. , impression) of this "high spot" of American literature were a "top stained yellow" and a perfect title-page border; the "second issue" ( i.e. , impression), he said, was marked by "a break in the title-page rule border." 1 In 1941 Whitman Bennett provided a fuller description; he found the "first issue" to be bound in yellow cloth, with the top edges of the sheets "white (not stained)." As further distinguishing marks of "first state, first issue copies" he mentioned "perfect type in the word 'the,' p. 251, 1. 3, which is badly broken in all later printings," and "a break in the outer vertical rule of the title page frame, about one-quarter of the way up from the bottom of the sheet." 2 Jacob Blanck in his 1936 revision of Merle Johnson's American First Editions had indicated that the first issue had a "top stained yellow" although he suggested the existence of "some copies, possibly of the first printing, with either unstained or orange tops." 3 In the 1942 revision of this work, possibly influenced by Mr. Bennett's statement the year before, Mr. Blanck added that "the earliest copies have perfect type at p. 251, line 3, the word the ." 4 Apart from the color of the top, the question seems to be one of "Was the type of the word the perfect and the title-page frame broken in the earliest printing, or was the situation merely the reverse?" On the copyright page of the third and all subsequent printings which I have seen (fourth, fifth, and sixth), the dates of the first and second printings are indicated as "April, 1919" and "December, 1919." (Had such a notice appeared on corresponding pages of the first and second printings, the confusion we have seen above would, of course, have been avoided.) On June 1, 1919, the book was reviewed in the New York Sun. Here the reviewer railed at Anderson's "very bad English"; he particularly pointed out the poor grammar in one of Anderson's sentences: "an intense silence seemed to lay over everything." 5 Whether in response to this particular review or to some other notice of the error, the second printing and all subsequent printings read "lie" in the passage quoted, to be found on page 86, line 5. Here then is a certain indication of the priority of the printings; Anderson's faulty grammar has provided us the clue. 6 Unfortunately, I have been able to locate only two copies which have the "lay" readings; the better preserved one is to be found in the Sherwood Anderson Collection of the Newberry Library, Chicago, with an inscription to a friend in Anderson's hand on the inside of the front cover. It is enclosed in a white dust jacket, and bound in orange cloth, with the publisher's device blind stamped on the front cover and with a white paper label on the spine; the top edge of the sheets is stained orange-yellow. The title page frame is perfect ; the type in the word the , page 251, line 3, is broken . 7 Any copy of the work, then, which contains the revised reading "lie", and which has no indication of the date of printing on the copyright page, must, it seems, be suspect of being one of the second printing, December, 1919. One has little difficulty locating copies of this kind; and those which I have examined have been uniformly distinguished by the points noted by Mr. Bennett for "the first issue." They are bound in yellow cloth, with the top of the sheets unstained. In each there is a break in the outer vertical rule of the title-page frame, about one and three-eighths inches up from the lower horizontal rule; in each the type in the word the , page 251, line 3, is perfect. Furthermore, collation of the copies of the first printing with those which must now be considered of the second printing reveals two other points: (1) in the first printing the type in the word cutting , page 260, line 9, is perfect; it is broken in the second printing, although it has been corrected in the third and all later printings; and (2) in the first printing the type in the first his , page 196, line 9, is perfect; the letters is are depressed in the second printing, although they have been raised in the third and all later printings. It may be of interest, finally, to note that the break in the title page rule, mentioned by Mr. Bennett as distinguishing the first printing, continues to appear in the third printing (January, 1921) but has been corrected in the fourth (December, 1921) and all subsequent printings. The word the , page 251, line 3, mentioned by Mr. Bennett as "badly broken in all later printings [than the first]," actually remains perfect from the second through the sixth printing (March, 1927), where my investigation ended.</field>

The Newberry copy may have been merely a defective one, or perhaps it represents a first state of the first printing.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Text of T. S. Eliot's "Gerontion" William H. Marshall</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN March, 1947, Professor Willard Thorp of Princeton University delivered an address, "The Poetry of T. S. Eliot," at the University of Virginia before a McGregor Room Seminar. The sponsors proposed to reprint "Gerontion" in the program, and at first chose the poem as found in the 1936 Harcourt, Brace edition of the Collected Poems, 1909-1935 . However, when they consulted a few earlier editions in order to assure themselves of the correctness of the text, they discovered that variants existed, and therefore they amused themselves by constructing an eclectic text for the program. On a subsequent occasion the late Peters Rushton showed this program-text to Mr. Eliot, pointing out to him some of the variants which had been noticed. Mr. Eliot was interested and marked a copy of the program, altering two of the readings and confirming others by checks. 1 The results are of some interest, demonstrating that no printed edition up to the present has conformed in every detail with Eliot's full intentions. The poem, therefore, offers a neat case history indicating that the need for critical editing according to principles of textual criticism is by no means confined to literature of earlier periods. "Gerontion" has appeared to date in seven collected editions totalling sixteen impressions, as follows: A. Ara Vos Prec , London, Ovid Press (1919) B. Poems , New York, Knopf (1920) C. Poems, 1909-1925 , London, Faber and Gwyer (1925) a) second impression, Faber and Gwyer (1926) b) third impression, Faber and Gwyer (1928) c) fourth impression, Faber and Faber (1930) D. Poems , New York, Knopf (1927) E. Poems, 1909-1925 , London, Faber and Faber (1932) a) second impression, New York and Chicago, Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co. (1932) 2 F. Collected Poems, 1909-1935 , London, Faber and Faber (1936), a so-called "advance proof" impression for limited circulation 3 a) second impression, Faber and Faber (1936), the earliest impression of this edition distributed to the trade: labelled "first edition" by the publisher. b) third impression, Faber and Faber (1936) G. Collected Poems, 1909-1935 , New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co. (1936) a) second impression, Harcourt, Brace (1936) b) third impression, Harcourt, Brace (1945) c) fourth impression, Harcourt, Brace (1948) The following chart details the variants which have appeared in these seven edition-texts, some through author's corrections or revisions but some through printers' errors. The final column provides the readings in the McGregor program-text which Eliot either passed by without comment or which he checked or altered. A preceding asterisk indicates readings which he confirmed by checks; a double asterisk indicates Eliot's alteration of the text to the form given. A B. C.

The textual history of these editions is made reasonably clear by this collation. It is obvious that (B) Knopf's first American edition was set from an author-revised copy of (A) on the evidence of lines 17, 26, 57, 67, 70, 71, and 72, all of which appear to contain authoritative changes. The omission of the comma in the heading and the umlaut in line 28, and the repetition in 73, are misprints. 7 The case is less certain for the variants in lines 1 and 42, since it is possible that Eliot inadvertently passed over these in the program, although his silence may have represented approval of the altered form. An interesting change made in the third edition (C) concerns the exclamation point in line 17. The wrong position in which this is printed suggests an authoritative attempt at revision made in proof or in a copy of (B), in which the substitution of the exclamation for the colon was marked marginally but the necessary change in position was not made clear to the printer. The variant in lines 28 and 73 corrects a misprint, but that in line 62 is an error. The fourth edition (D), by Knopf in 1927, was obviously set from (B), Knopf's 1920 text, on the evidence of the colon in line 17. An Americanization creeps into line 8, and the variant "at" in line 9 is a misprint. This edition, therefore, has no authority. The fifth edition (E) by Faber in 1932 used Faber's (C) of 1926 as printer's copy. The substitution of single for double quotes and the correct placement of the exclamation point in line 17 might have been made in proof, and appear to be authoritative. 8 Otherwise there is no change, except for the misprint in line 28 and the correction of line 62. Faber's expanded collection of 1936 (F) was set from (E), with Eliot making the authoritative alteration, either in copy or in proof, of "it" to "them" in line 60. The misplaced umlaut in line 28 is a repeated printer's error. As we should expect, Harcourt's expanded edition (G) was set from (F) but with the umlaut corrected. The one puzzling point is the reversion to double quotes in line 17. The omission of the period in line 53 is a misprint. If we make the assumption, as is very plausible, that the commas added in (B) in lines 1, 7, and 42 are authoritative (despite the fact that Eliot silently passed over the omitted comma in line 1 of the program), the only crux remaining is the correct position of the exclamation point in line 17. This is a quasi-substantive matter, for the meaning is affected by the use of the exclamation as referring to the quoted material itself or as Eliot's comment on the quotation. However, it would be rather perverse to argue that the position outside the quotes in (C), when the point first appears, is the authoritative one which was subsequently moved inside by printers' usage and overlooked in successive proofs. The opposing argument is very strong, that an actual error was caused in (C) by a proof or copy annotation indicating the substitution but neglecting to alter the position from that of the deleted colon. Finally, it is possible to conjecture that the punctuation changes in lines 35 and 37 of (B) were in fact authoritative but that, subsequently, Eliot came to prefer the original pointing as found only in (A).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 This annotated copy is deposited in the Alderman Library of the University of Virginia. 2 In a letter of 10 November 1950, the firm of Harcourt, Brace kindly confirmed that their printings were made "from a similar, if not the same, set of plates," as the Faber and Faber edition, the London printing being the earlier. 3 Here, as elsewhere, I am indebted to Mr. Donald C. Gallup of the Yale University Library for special information. 4 A misprint in the program not noticed by Eliot. 5 The program read "it". 6 The program read "man,". 7 The omission of the umlaut doubtless arose through an attempt to correct its misplacement in (A). 8 The fact that Eliot silently passed over the double quotes in the program-text need not be taken too seriously, since it would seem that only the asterisked variants were specifically pointed out to him. See also line 28 in which a misprint was unnoticed.</field>
